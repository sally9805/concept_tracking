txt //l or world-history travels from east to west , for Europe is absolutely the end of history , Asia the beginning . The history of the world has an east in an absolute sense , for , although the earth forms a sphere , history describes no orbit round it , but has , on the contrary , a determinate orient  --  viz. , Asia . Here rises the outward visible sun , and in the west it sinks down ; here also rises the sun of self-consciousness . The history of the world is a discipline of the uncontrolled natural will , bringing it into obedience to a universal principle and conferring a subjective freedom . The East knew , and to this day knows , freedom only for one ; the Greek and Roman world knew that some are free ; the German world knows that all are free . The first political form , therefore , that we see in history is despotism ; the second democracy and aristocracy ; and the third monarchy . The first phase  --  that with which we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substantial , objective , spiritual existence  --  forms the basis ; to which the subjective will first sustains a relation in the form of faith , confidence , obedience . In the political life of the East we find realised national freedom , developing itself without advancing to subjective freedom . It is the childhood of history . In the gorgeous edifices of the Oriental empires we find all national ordinances and arrangements , but in such a way that individuals remain as mere accidents . These revolve round a centre , round the sovereign , who as patriarch stands ( not as despot , in the sense of the Roman imperial constitution ) at the head . For he has to enforce the moral and substantial ; he has to uphold those essential ordinances which are already established ; so that what among us belongs entirely to subjective freedom , here proceeds from the entire and general body of the state . The glory of the Oriental conception is the one individual as the substantial being to which all belongs , so that no other individual has a separate existence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the riches of imagination and nature are appropriated to that dominant existence in which subjective freedom is essentially merged ; the latter looks for its dignity not in itself but in the absolute object . All the elements of a complete state  --  even subjectivity  --  may be found there , but not yet harmonised with the grand substantial being . For outside the one power  --  before which nothing can maintain an independent existence  --  there is only revolting caprice , which , beyond the limits of the central power , moves at will without purpose or result . Accordingly we find the wild herds breaking out from the upland , falling upon the countries in question and laying them waste , or settling down in them and giving up their wild life ; but in all cases lost resultlessly in the central substance . This phase of substantiality , since it has not taken up its antithesis into itself and overcome it , directly divides itself into two elements . On the one side we see duration , stability  --  empires belonging , as it were , to mere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as , for example , in China , the state based on the family relation . Yet the states in question , without undergoing any change in themselves , or in the principle of their existence , are constantly changing their opinion towards each other . They are in ceaseless conflict , which brings on rapid destruction . The opposing principle of individuality enters into these conflicting relations ; but it is itself as yet only unconscious , merely natural universality  --  light which is not yet the light of the personal soul . This history , too , is for the most part really unhistorical , for it is only the repetition of the same majestic ruin . The new element which , in the shape of bravery , prowess , magnanimity , occupies the place of the previous despotic pomp goes through the same cycle of decline and subsidence . And this subsidence , therefore , is not really such ; for through all this restless change no advance has been made . History passes at this point  --  and only outwardly , that is , without connection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry on the comparison with the individual man , this would be the boyhood of history , no longer manifesting the repose and trustfulness of the child , but boisterous and turbulent . @# II .  --  Greece , Rome and Christianity The Greek world may , then , be compared to the season of adolescence , for here we have individualities shaping themselves . This is the second main principle in human history . Morality is , as in Asia , a principle , but it is morality impressed on individuality , and consequently denoting the free volition of individuals . Here , then , is the union of the moral with the subjective will , or the kingdom of beautiful freedom , for the idea is united with a plastic form . It is not yet regarded abstractly , but intimately bound up with the real , as in a beautiful work of art ; the sensible bears the stamp and expression of the spiritual . The kingdom is consequently true harmony ; it is a world of the most charming but perishable , or quickly passing , bloom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is becoming  --  not yet true morality . The individual will of the subject adopts without reflection the conduct and habit prescribed by justice and the laws . The individual is , therefore , in unconscious unity with the idea  --  the social weal . The third phase is the realm of abstract universality ( in which the social aim absorbs all individual aims ) ; it is the Roman state , the severe labours of the manhood of history . For true manhood acts neither in accordance with the caprice of a despot nor in obedience to a graceful caprice of its own . It works for a general aim , one in which the individual perishes and realises his own private object only in that general aim . The state begins to have an abstract existence and to develop itself for a definite object , in accomplishing which its members have indeed a share , but not a complete and concrete one ( calling their whole being into play ) . Free individuals are sacrificed to the severe demands of the national ends , to which they must surrender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state is not a repetition of such a state of individuals as was the Athenian polis . The geniality and joy of soul that existed there have given place to harsh and rigorous toil . The interest of history is detached from individuals . But when , subsequently , in the historical development , individuality gains the ascendant , and the breaking up of the community into its component atoms can be restrained only by external compulsion , then the subjective might of individual despotism comes forward to play its part . The individual is led to seek consolation for the loss of his freedom in exercising and developing his private rights . In the next place , the pain inflicted by despotism begins to be felt , and spirit , driven back into its utmost depths , leaves the godless world , seeks for a harmony in itself , and begins now an inner life  --  a complete concrete subjectivity , which at the same time possesses a substantiality that is not grounded in mere external existence . Within the soul , therefore , arises the spiritual solution of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of following its own capricious choice , is purified and elevated into universality  --  a subjectivity that of its own free will adopts principles tending to the good of all , reaches , in fact , a divine personality . To the worldly empire this spiritual one wears a predominant aspect of opposition , as the empire of subjectivity that has attained to the knowledge of itself  --  itself in its essential nature  --  the empire of spirit in its full sense . The Christian community found itself in the Roman world , but as it was secluded from this state , and did not hold the emperor for its absolute sovereign , it was the object of persecution . Then was manifested its inward liberty in the steadfastness with which sufferings were borne . As regards its relation to the truth , the fathers of the Church built up the dogma , but a chief element was furnished by the previous development of philosophy . Just as Philo found a deeper import shadowed forth in the Mosaic record and idealised what he considered the bare shell of the narrative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was through the Christian religion that the absolute idea of God , in if true conception , attained consciousness . Here man , too , finds himself comprehended in his true nature , given in the specific conception of " the Son . " Man , finite when regarded for himself , is yet at the same time the image of God and a fountain of infinity in himself . Consequently he has his true home in a super-sensuous world  --  an infinite subjectivity , gained only by a rupture with mere natural existence and volition . This is religious self-consciousness . The first abstract principles are won by the instrumentality of the Christian religion for the secular state . First , under Christianity slavery is impossible ; for man as man  --  in the abstract essence of his nature  --  is contemplated in God ; each unit of mankind is an object of the grace of God and of the divine purpose . Utterly excluding all speciality , therefore , man , in and for himself  --  in his simple quality of man  --  has infinite value ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attaching to birth or country . The other , the second principle , regards the subjectivity of man in its bearing on chance . Humanity has this sphere of free spirituality in and for itself , and everything else must proceed from it . The place appropriated to the abode and presence of the Divine Spirit  --  the sphere in question  --  is spiritual subjectivity , and is constituted the place in which all contingency is amenable . It follows , thence , that what we observe among the Greeks as a form of customary morality can not maintain its position in the Christian world . For that morality is spontaneous , unreflected wont ; while the Christian principle is independent subjectivity  --  the soil on which grows the True . Now , an unreflected morality can not continue to hold its ground against the principle of subjective freedom . Now the principle of absolute freedom in God makes its appearance . Man no longer sustains the relation of dependence , but of love  --  in the consciousness that he is a partaker in the Divine existence . @# III . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point of development  --  the fourth phase of world history . The old age of nature is weakness ; but this of spirit is its perfect maturity and strength , in which it returns to unity with itself , but in its fully developed character as spirit . The Greeks and Romans had reached maturity within ere they directed their energies outwards . The Germans , on the contrary , began with self-diffusion , deluging the world , and breaking down in their course the hollow political fabrics of the civilised nations . Only then did their development begin , kindled by a foreign culture , a foreign religion , polity , and legislation . The process of culture they underwent consisted in taking up foreign elements into their own national life . The German world took up the Roman culture and religion in their completed form . The Christian religion which it adopted had received from councils and fathers of the Church  --  who possessed the whole culture , and in particular the philosophy of the Greek and Roman world  --  a perfected dogmatic system . The Church , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tongue of the Germans the Church likewise opposed one perfectly developed  --  the Latin . In art and philosophy a similar alien influence predominated . The same principle holds good in regard to the form of the secular sovereignty . Gothic and other chiefs gave themselves the name of Roman patricians . Thus , superficially , the German world appears to be a continuation of the Roman . But there dwelt in it an entirely new spirit  --  the free spirit which reposes on itself . The three periods of this world will have to be treated accordingly . The first period begins with the appearance of the German nations in the Roman Empire . The Christian world presents itself as Christendom  --  one mass of which , the spiritual and the secular , form only different aspects . This epoch extends to Charlemagne . In the second period the Church develops for itself a theocracy and the state a feudal monarchy . Charlemagne had formed an alliance with the Holy See against the Lombards and the factions of the nobles in Rome . A union thus arose between the spiritual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on earth promised to follow in the wake of this conciliation . But just at this time , instead of a spiritual kingdom of heaven , the inwardness of the Christian principle wears the appearance of being altogether directed outwards , and leaving its proper sphere . Christian freedom is perverted to its very opposite , both in a religious and secular respect ; on the one hand to the severest bondage , on the other to the most immoral excess  --  a barbarous intensity of every passion . The first half of the sixteenth century marks the beginning of the third period . Secularity appears now as gaining a consciousness of its intrinsic worth ; it becomes aware that it possesses a value of its own in the morality , rectitude , probity , and activity of man . The consciousness of independent validity is aroused through the restoration of Christian freedom . The Christian principle has now passed through the terrible discipline of culture , and it first attains truth and reality through the Reformation . This third period extends to our own times . The principle of free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and from this principle are evolved the universal axioms of reason . Formal thought  --  the understanding  --  had been already developed , but thought received its true material first with the Reformation . From that Epoch thought began to gain a culture properly its ' own ; principles were derived from it which were to be the norm for the constitution of the state . Political life was now to be consciously regulated by reason . Customary morality , traditional usage , lost their validity ; the various claims insisted upon must prove their legitimacy as based on rational principles . These epochs may be compared with the earlier empires . In the German aeon , as the realm of totality , we see the earlier epochs resumed . Charlemagne 's time may be compared with the Persian Empire ; it is the period of substantive unity , this unity having its foundation in the inner man , the heart , and both in the spiritual and the secular still abiding in its simplicity . To the Greek world and its merely ideal unity the time preceding Charles V. answers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phases of particularity have become fixed in privileges and peculiar rights As , in the interior of the realms themselves , the different estates of the realm , with their several claims , are isolated , so do the various states in their foreign aspects occupy a merely external relation one to another . A diplomatic policy arises which , in the interest of a European balance of power , unites them with and against each other . It is the time in which the world becomes clear and manifest to all ( discovery of America ) . So , too , does consciousness gain clearness in the super-sensuous world , and respecting it . Substantial objective religion brings itself to sensuous clearness in the sensuous element ( Christian art ) , and also becomes clear to itself in the element of inmost truth . We may compare this time with that of Pericles . The introversion of spirit begins ( Socrates  --  Luther ) , though Pericles is wanting in this epoch . Charles V. possesses enormous possibilities in point of outward appliances , and appears absolute in his power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the absolute means of establishing a free sovereignty , is not in him . This is the epoch when spirit becomes clear to itself in separations occurring in the realm of reality ; now the distinct elements of the German world manifest their essential nature . The third epoch may be compared to the Roman world . The authority of national aim is acknowledged , and privileges melt away before the common object of the state . @# IV .  --  Modern Times Spirit at last perceives that nature  --  the world  --  must be an embodiment of reason . An interest in the contemplation and comprehension of the present world became universal . Thus experimental science became the science of the world ; for experimental science involves , on the one hand , the observation of phenomena ; on the other hand , also the discovery of the law , the essential being , the hidden force , that causes those phenomena  --  thus reducing the data supplied by observation to their simple principles . Intellectual consciousness was first extricated by Descartes from that sophistry of thought which unsettles everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the principle of spirit first manifested itself , so it was by the Romanic nations that the abstract idea was first comprehended . Experimental science , therefore , very soon made its way among them , in common with the Protestant English , but especially among the Italians . It seemed to men as if God had but just created the moon and stars , plants and animals ; as if the laws of the universe were now established for the first time ; for only then did they feel a real interest in the universe when they recognised their own reason in the reason that pervades it . The human eye became clear , perception quick , thought active and interpretative . The discovery of the laws of nature enabled men to contend against the monstrous superstition of the time , as also against all notions of mighty alien powers which magic alone could conquer . The independent authority of subjectivity was maintained against belief founded on authority , and the laws of nature were recognised as the only bond connecting phenomena with phenomena . Man is at home in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he finds himself at home ; he is free through the acquaintance he has gained with nature . Nor was thought less vigorously directed to the spiritual side . Right and social morality came to be looked upon as having their foundation in the actual present will of man , whereas formerly it was referred only to the command of God enjoined ab extra , written in the Old or New Testament , or appearing in the form of particular right , as opposed to that based on general principles , in old parchments as privilegia , or in international compacts . Luther had secured to mankind spiritual freedom , and the reconciliation of the objective and the subjective in the concrete . He had triumphantly established the position that man 's eternal destiny must be wrought out in himself . But the import of that which is to take place in him  --  what truth is to become vital to him  --  was taken for granted by Luther , as something already given , something revealed by religion . Now the principle was set up that this import must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of inward demonstration every dogma must be referred . This is the point which consciousness has attained , and these are the principal phases of that form in which the principle of freedom has realised itself , for the history of the world is nothing but the development of the idea of freedom . But objective freedom  --  the laws of " real " freedom  --  demands the subjugation of the mere contingent will , for this is in its nature formal . If the objective is in itself rational , human insight and conviction must correspond with the reason which it embodies , and then we have the other essential element  --  subjective freedom  --  also realised . We have confined ourselves to the consideration of that progress of the idea which has led to this consummation . Philosophy concerns itself only with the glory of the idea mirroring itself in the history of the world , and with the development which the idea has passed through in realising itself  --  i.e. , the idea of freedom , whose reality is the consciousness of freedom and nothing short of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the changing scenes which its annals present , is this true process of development and the realisation of spirit  --  this is the true Theodikaia , the justification of God in history . The spirit of man may be reconciled with the course of universal history only by perception of this truth  --  that all which has happened , all that happens daily , is Political David Hume , the Scottish philosopher and historian , was born at Edinburgh , April 26 , 1711 , and was educated at the college there . He tried law and business without liking either , and at the age of 23 went to France , where he wandered about for a while occupied with dreams of philosophy . In 1739 he published the first part of his " Treatise on Human Nature . " The book set an army of philosophers at work trying either to refute what he had said or continue lines that he had suggested , and out of them were created both the Scotch and German schools of metaphysicians . Hume 's " Essays , Moral and Political , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ described as the " dead-born " " Treatise on Human Nature , " the success of the former going a long way towards compensating him for the failure of the latter . In the advertisement to a posthumous edition Hume complains that controversialists had confined their attacks to the crude , earlier treatise , and expressed the desire that for the future the " Essays " might alone be regarded as containing his philosophical sentiments and principles . In the " Essays " Hume brings to bear the results of his criticism upon the problems of current speculative discussion . The argument against miracles is still often discussed ; and the work is well worthy of the author whom many regard as the greatest thinker of his time . In 1751 he published his " Inquiry Into the Principles of Morals , " which is one of the clearest expositions of the leading principles of what is termed the utilitarian system . Hume died on August 25 , 1776. @# I.  --  Doubts Concerning the Understanding All the objects of human reason or inquiry may naturally be divided into two kinds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact . Of the first kind are the sciences of geometry , algebra , and arithmetic , and , in short , every affirmation which is either intuitively or demonstratively certain . " That the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the squares of the two sides " is a proposition which expresses a relation between these figures . " That three times five is equal to the half of thirty " expresses a relation between these numbers . Propositions of this kind are discoverable by the mere operation of thought , without dependence on what is anywhere existent in the universe . Though there never were a circle or triangle in nature , the truths demonstrated by Euclid would for ever retain their certainty and evidence . Matters of fact , which are the second objects of human reason , are not ascertained in the same manner ; nor is our evidence of their truth , however great , of a like nature with the foregoing . The contrary of every matter of fact is still possible , because it can never imply a contradiction , and is conceived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if ever so conformable to reality . " That the sun will not rise to-morrow " is no less intelligible a proposition , and implies no more contradiction , than the affirmative that " it will rise . " We should in vain , therefore , attempt to demonstrate its falsehood . Were it demonstratively false , it would imply a contradiction , and could never be distinctly conceived by the mind . It may , therefore , be a subject worthy of curiosity to inquire what is the nature of that evidence which assures us of any real existence of matters of fact beyond the present testimony of our senses , or the records of our memory . All reasonings concerning matter of fact seem to be founded on the relation of cause and effect . If we would satisfy ourselves , therefore , concerning the nature of that evidence which assures us of matters of fact , we must inquire how we arrive at the knowledge of cause and effect . I shall venture to affirm , as a general proposition which admits of no exception , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , attained by reasonings a priori , but arises entirely from experience . To convince us that all the laws of nature , and all the operations of bodies without exception , are known only by experience , the following reflections may perhaps suffice . Were any object presented to us , and were we required to pronounce concerning the effect which will result from it , without consulting past observation , after what manner , I beseech you , must the mind proceed in this operation ? It must invent or imagine some event , which it ascribes to the object as its effect ; and it is plain that this invention must be entirely arbitrary . The mind can never possibly find the effect in the supposed cause by the most accurate scrutiny and examination . For the effect is totally different from the cause , and , consequently , can never be discovered in it . A stone or piece of metal raised into the air and left without any support immediately falls . But , to consider the matter a priori , is there anything we discover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downward rather than an upward , or any other motion , in the stone or metal ? In a word , then , every effect is a distinct event from its cause . It could not , therefore , be discovered in the cause , and the first invention or conception of it , a priori , must be entirely arbitrary . And , even after it is suggested , the conjunction of it with the cause must appear equally arbitrary , since there are always many other effects which to reason must seem fully as consistent and natural . In vain , therefore , should we pretend to determine any single event , or infer any cause or effect , without the assistance of observation and experience . Hence , we may discover the reason why no philosopher who is rational and modest has ever pretended to assign the ultimate cause of any natural operation , or to show distinctly the action of that power which produces any single effect in the universe . I say , then , that even after we have experience of the operations of cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ founded on reasoning , or any process of the understanding . The bread which I formerly ate nourished me ; that is , a body of such sensible qualities was at that time endued with such secret powers ; but does it follow that other bread must also nourish me at another time , and that like sensible qualities must always be attended with like secret powers ? The consequence seems nowise necessary . At least , it must be acknowledged that there is here a consequence drawn by the mind , that there is a certain step taken ; a process of thought , and an inference which wants to be explained . These two propositions are far from being the same : " I have found that such an object has always been attended with such an effect , " and : " I foresee that other objects , which are in appearance similar , will be attended with similar effects . " I shall allow , if you please , that the one proposition may justly be inferred from the other ; I know , in fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the inference is not intuitive ; neither is it demonstrative . Of what nature is it , then ? To say it is experimental is begging the question . For all inferences from experience suppose , as their foundation , that the future will resemble the past , and that similar powers will be conjoined with similar sensible qualities . If there be any suspicion that the course of nature may change , and that the past may be no rule for the future , all experience becomes useless , and can give rise to no inference or conclusion . It is impossible , therefore , that any arguments from experience can prove this resemblance of the past to the future , since all these arguments are founded on the supposition of that resemblance . Let the course of things be allowed hitherto ever so regular , that alone , without some new argument or inference , proves not that for the future it will continue so . In vain do you pretend to have learned the nature of bodies from your past experience . Their secret nature , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any change in their sensible qualities . This happens sometimes , and with regard to some objects . Why may it not happen always , and with regard to all objects ? What logic , what process of argument , secures you against this supposition ? My practice , you say , refutes my doubts . But you mistake the purport of my question . As an agent , I am quite satisfied on the point ; but as a philosopher , who has some share of curiosity , I will not say scepticism , I want to learn the foundation of this inference . All inferences from experience are effects of custom , not of reasoning . We have already observed that nature has established connections among particular ideas , and that no sooner one idea occurs to our thoughts than it introduces its correlative , and carries our attention towards it by a gentle and insensible movement . These principles of connection or association we have reduced to three  --  namely , resemblance , contiguity , and causation , which are the only bonds that unite our thoughts together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a greater or less degree , takes place among mankind . Now , here arises a question on which the solution of the present difficulty will depend . Does it happen in all these relations that when one of the objects is presented to the senses or memory the mind is not only carried to the conception of the correlative , but reaches a steadier and stronger conception of it than otherwise it would have been able to attain ? This seems to be the case with that belief which arises from the relation of cause and effect . And I shall add that it is conformable to the ordinary wisdom of nature to secure so necessary an act of the mind by some instinct or mechanical tendency , which may be infallible in its operations , may discover itself at the first appearance of life and thought , and may be independent of all the laboured deductions of the understanding . @# II .  --  On Miracles A wise man proportions his belief to the evidence . In such conclusions as are founded on an infallible experience he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and regards his past experience as a full proof of the future existence of that event . In other cases he proceeds with more caution . He weighs the opposite experiments . He considers which side is supported by the greatest number of experiments ; to that side he inclines with doubt and hesitation , and when at last he fixes his judgment , the evidence exceeds not what we properly call probability . All probability , then , supposes an opposition of experiments and observations , where the one side is found to overbalance the other , and to produce a degree of evidence proportioned to the superiority . When the fact attested is such a one as has seldom fallen under our observation , here is a contest of two possible experiences , of which the one destroys the other as far as its force goes , and the superior can only operate on the mind by the force which remains . The very same principle of experience which gives us a certain degree of assurance in the testimony of witnesses gives us also , in this case , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to establish , from which consideration there necessarily arises a counterpoise , and mutual destruction of belief and authority . But in order to increase the probability against the testimony of witnesses , let us suppose that the fact which they affirm , instead of being only marvellous , is really miraculous ; and suppose also that the testimony , considered apart and in itself , amounts to an entire proof , of which the strongest must prevail , but still with a diminution of its force in proportion to that of its antagonist . A miracle is a violation of the laws of nature ; and as a firm and unalterable experience has established these laws , the proof against a miracle , from the very nature of the fact , is as entire as any argument from experience can possibly be imagined . Why is it more than probable that all men must die ; that lead can not of itself remain suspended in the air ; that fire consumes wood , and is extinguished by water ; unless it be that these events are found agreeable to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these laws , or , in other words , a miracle , to prevent them ? Nothing is esteemed a miracle if it ever happen in the common course of nature . It is no miracle that a man seemingly in good health should die on a sudden , because such a kind of death , though more unusual than any other , has yet been frequently observed to happen . But it is a miracle that a dead man should come to life , because that has never been observed in any age or country . There must , therefore , be a uniform experience against every miraculous event , otherwise the event would not merit that appellation . And as a uniform experience amounts to a proof , there is here a direct and full proof , from the nature of the fact , against the existence of any miracle ; nor can such a proof be destroyed , or the miracle rendered credible , but by an opposite proof which is superior . The plain consequence is ( and it is a general maxim worthy of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a miracle unless the testimony be of such a kind that its falsehood would be more miraculous than the fact which it endeavours to establish ; and even in that case there is a mutual destruction of arguments , and the superior only gives us an assurance suitable to that degree of force which remains after deducting the inferior . " There surely never was a greater number of miracles ascribed to one person than those which were lately said to have been wrought in France upon the tomb of Abbe Paris , the famous Jansenist , with whose sanctity the people were so long deluded . The curing of the sick , giving hearing to the deaf and sight to the blind , were everywhere talked of as the usual effects of that holy sepulchre . But , what is more extraordinary , many of the miracles were immediately proved upon the spot before judges of unquestioned integrity , attested by witnesses of credit and distinction , in a learned age , and in the most eminent theatre that is now in the world . Nor is this all ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor were the Jesuits  --  though a learned body , supported by the civil magistrate and determined enemies to those opinions in whose favour the miracles were said to have been wrought  --  ever able distinctly to refute or detect them . Where shall we find such a number of circumstances agreeing to the corroboration of one fact ? And what have we to oppose to such a cloud of witnesses but the absolute impossibility or miraculous nature of the events which they relate ? And this surely , in the eyes of all reasonable people , will alone be regarded as a sufficient refutation . Suppose that all the historians who treat of England should agree that on January 1 , 1600 , Queen Elizabeth died ; that both before and after her death she was seen by her physicians and the whole court , as is usual with persons of her rank ; that her successor was acknowledged and proclaimed by the Parliament ; and that , after being interred a month , she again appeared , resumed the throne , and governed England for three years ; I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of so many odd circumstances , but should not have the least inclination to believe so miraculous an event . I should not doubt of her pretended death , and of those other public circumstances that followed it ; I should only assert it to have been pretended , and that it neither was , nor possibly could be , real . You would in vain object to me the difficulty and almost impossibility of deceiving the world in an affair of such consequence ; the wisdom and solid judgment of that renowned queen ; with the little or no advantage which she could reap from so poor an artifice . All this might astonish me ; but I would still reply that the knavery and folly of men are such common phenomena that I should rather believe the most extraordinary events to arise from their concurrence than admit of so signal a violation of the laws of nature . Our most holy religion is founded on faith , not on reason ; and it is a sure method of exposing it to put it to such a trial as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this more evident , let us examine those miracles related in the Pentateuch , which we shall examine as the production of a mere human writer and historian . Here , then , we are first to consider a book , presented to us by a barbarous and ignorant people , written in an age when they were still more barbarous , and in all probability long after the facts which it relates , corroborated by no concurring testimony , and resembling those fabulous accounts which every nation gives of its origin . Upon reading this book we find it full of prodigies and miracles . It gives an account of a state of the world and of human nature entirely different from the present ; of our fall from that state ; of the age of man extended to near a thousand years ; of the destruction of the world by a deluge ; of the arbitrary choice of one people as the favourites of Heaven , and that people the countrymen of the author ; of their deliverance from bondage by prodigies the most astonishing imaginable . I desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after a serious consideration , declare whether he thinks that the falsehood of such a book , supported by such a testimony , would be more extraordinary and miraculous than the miracles it relates , which is , however , necessary to make it be received according to the measures of probability above established . @# III .  --  Of a Particular Providence and of a Future State I was lately engaged in conversation with a friend who loves sceptical paradoxes . To my expression of the opinion that a wise magistrate can justly be jealous of certain tenets of philosophy such as those of Epicurus , which , denying a divine existence , and consequently a Providence and a future state , seem to loosen the ties of morality , he replied as follows . " If Epicurus had been accused before the people he could easily have defended his cause and proved his principles of philosophy to be as salutary as those of his adversaries . And , if you please , I shall suppose myself Epicurus for a moment , and make you stand for the Athenian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ye Athenians , to justify in your assembly what I maintained in my school , and I find myself impeached by furious antagonists instead of reasoning with calm and dispassionate inquirers . By my accusers it is acknowledged that the chief or sole argument for a divine existence ( which I never questioned ) is derived from the order of nature ; where there appear such marks of intelligence and design that you think it extravagant to assign for its cause either chance or the blind and unguided force of matter . You allow that this is an argument drawn from effects to causes . From the order of the work you infer that there must have been project and forethought in the workman . If you can not make out this point , you allow that your conclusion fails , and you pretend not to establish the conclusion in a greater latitude than the phenomena of nature will justify . These are your concessions . I desire you to mark the consequences . When we infer any particular cause from an effect we must proportion the one to the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause any qualities but what are sufficient to produce the effect . A body of ten ounces raised in a scale may serve as a proof that the counterbalancing weight exceeds ten ounces , but never that it exceeds a hundred . The same rule holds whether the cause assigned be brute , unconscious matter or a rational , intelligent being . If the cause be known only by the effect , we never ought to ascribe to it any qualities beyond what are precisely requisite to produce the effect . Nor can we return back from the cause and infer other effects from it beyond those by which alone it is known to us . Allowing , therefore , the gods to be the authors of the existence , or order , of the universe , it follows that they possess that precise degree of power , intelligence , and benevolence which appears in their workmanship ; but we can never be allowed to mount up from the universe , the effect , to Jupiter , the cause , and then descend downwards to infer any new effect from that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the effect , they must be exactly adjusted to each other ; and the one can never refer to anything farther . I deny a Providence , you say , and Supreme Governor of the world , who guides the course of events and punishes the vicious with infamy and disappointment , and rewards the virtuous with honour and success in all their undertakings . But surely I deny not the course of events itself , which lies open to everyone 's inquiry and examination . I acknowledge that , in the present order of things , virtue is attended with more peace of mind than vice , and meets with a more favourable reception from the world . I am sensible that , according to the past experience of mankind , friendship is the chief joy of human life , and moderation the only source of tranquillity and happiness . I never balance between the virtuous and the vicious life , but am sensible that , to a well-disposed mind , every advantage is on the side of the former . And what can you say more , allowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Critique of Pure Reason Immanuel Kant , the most celebrated of German metaphysicians , was born at Koenigsberg on April 22 , 1724 , and died on February 12 , 1804 . Taking his degree at Koenigsberg , he speedily entered on a professional career , which he quietly and strenuously pursued for over thirty years . Though his lectures were limited to the topics with which he was concerned as professor of logic and philosophy , his versatility is evidenced by the fact that he was offered the chair of poetry , which he declined . His lasting reputation began with the publication , in 1781 , of his wonderful " Critique of Pure Reason " ( " Kritik der reinen Vernunft " ) . Within twelve years of its appearance it was expounded in all the leading universities , and even penetrated into the schools of the Church of Rome . Kant was the first European thinker who definitely grasped the conception of a critical philosophy , though he was doubtless aided by the tendency of Locke 's psychology . He did much to counteract the sceptical influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Pure Reason " is to separate the necessary and universal in the realm of knowledge from the merely experimental or empirical . This little version of Kant 's celebrated work has been prepared from the German text . @# I.  --  Knowledge Transcendental : AEsthetic Experience is something of which we are conscious . It is the first result of our comprehension , but it is not the limit of our understanding , since it stimulates our faculty of reason , but does not satisfy its desire for knowledge . While all our knowledge may begin with sensible impressions or experience , there is an element in it which does not rise from this source , but transcends it . That knowledge is transcendental which is occupied not so much with mere outward objects as with our manner of knowing those objects , that is to say , with our a priori concepts of them . All our knowledge is either a priori or a posteriori . That is a posteriori knowledge which is derived from sensible experience as including sensible impressions or states ; while a priori knowledge is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever is universal or necessary . A complete " Transcendental Philosophy " would be a systematic exposition of all that is a priori in human knowledge , or of " all the principles of pure reason . " But a " Critique of Pure Reason " can not include all this . It can do little more than deal with the synthetic element or quality in a priori knowledge , as distinguished from the analytic element . We perceive objects through our sensibility which furnishes us , as our faculty of receptivity , with those intuitions that become translated into thought by means of the understanding . This is the origin of our conceptions , or ideas . I denominate as matter that which in a phenomenon corresponds to sensation ; while I call form that quality of matter which presents it in a perceived order . Only matter is presented to our minds a posteriori ; as to form , this must inevitably exist in the mind a priori , and therefore it can be considered apart from all sensation . Pure representation , entirely apart from sensation , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind , existing in it as a mere form of sensibility . Transcendental aesthetic is the science of all the principles of sensibility . But transcendental logic is the science of the principles of pure thought . In studying the former we shall find that there are two pure forms of sensuous intuition , namely , space and time . Are space and time actual entities ? Or are they only relations of things ? Space is simply the form of all the phenomena of external senses ; that is , it is the subjective condition of the sensibility under which alone external intuition is possible . Thus , the form of all phenomena may exist a priori in the soul as a pure intuition previous to all experience . So we can only speak of space and of extended objects from the standpoint of human reason . But when we have abstracted all the forms perceived by our sensibility , there remains a pure intuition which we call space . Therefore our discussion teaches us the objective validity of space with regard to all that can appear before us externally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space , with regard to things if they are considered in themselves by our reason , that is , without taking into account the nature of our sensibility . Time is not empirically conceived of ; that is , it is not experimentally apprehended . Time is a necessary representation on which all intuitions are dependent , and the representation of time to the mind is thus given a priori . In it alone can phenomena be apprehended . These may vanish , but time can not be put aside . Time is not something existing by itself independently , but is the formal condition a priori of all phenomena . If we deduct our own peculiar sensibility , then the idea of time disappears indeed , because it is not inherent in any object , but only in the subject which perceives that object . Space and time are essential a priori ideas , and they are the necessary conditions of all particular perceptions . From the latter and their objects we can , in imagination , without exception , abstract ; from the former we can not . Space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a priori pre-conditions of the possibility and reality of all phenomena . It is clear that transcendental aesthetic can obtain only these two elements , space and time , because all other concepts belong to the senses and pre-suppose experience , and so imply something empirical . For example , the concept of motion pre-supposes something moving , but in space regarded alone there is nothing that moves ; therefore , whatever moves must be recognised by experience , and is a purely empirical datum . @# II .  --  Transcendental Logic Our knowledge is derived from two fundamental sources of the consciousness . The first is the faculty of receptivity of impressions ; the second , the faculty of cognition of an object by means of these impressions or representations , this second power being sometimes styled spontaneity of concepts . By the first , an object is given to us ; by the second it is thought of in the mind . Thus intuition and concepts constitute the elements of our entire knowledge , for neither intuition without concepts , nor concepts without intuition , can yield any knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and logic , the former being the science of the rules of sensibility ; the latter , the science of the rules of the understanding . Logic can be treated in two directions : either as logic of the general use of the understanding , or of some particular use of it . The former includes the rules of thought , without which there can be no use of the understanding ; but it has no regard to the objects to which the understanding is applied . This is elementary logic . But logic of the understanding in some particular use includes rules of correct thought in relation to special classes of objects ; and this latter logic is generally taught in schools as preliminary to the study of sciences . Thus , general logic takes no account of any of the contents of knowledge , but is limited simply to the consideration of the forms of thought . But we are constrained by anticipation to form an idea of a logical science which has to deal not only with pure thought , but also has to determine the origin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relate , and this science might be styled transcendental logic . In transcendental aesthetic we isolated the faculty of sensibility . So in transcendental logic we isolate the understanding , concentrating our consideration on that element of thought which has its source simply in the understanding . But transcendental logic must be divided into transcendental analytic and transcendental dialectic . The former is a logic of truth , and is intended to furnish a canon of criticism . When logic is used to judge not analytically , but to judge synthetically of objects in general , it is called transcendental dialectic , which serves as a protection against sophistical fallacy . @# ANALYTIC OF PURE CONCEPTS The understanding may be defined as the faculty of judging . The function of thought in a judgment can be brought under four heads , each with three subdivisions. 1 . Quantity of judgments : Universal , particular , singular . 2 . Quality : Affirmative , negative , infinite . 3 . Relation : Categorical , hypothetical , disjunctive . 4 . Modality : Problematical , assertory , apodictic above contradiction . If we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in every one is involved some peculiar idea which is its essential characteristic . Thus , a singular judgment , in which the subject of discourse is a single object , involves obviously the special idea of oneness , or unity . A particular judgment , relating to several objects , implies the idea of plurality , and discriminates between the several objects . Now , the whole list of these ideas will constitute the complete classification of the fundamental conceptions of the understanding , regarded as the faculty which judges , and these may be called categories . 1 . Of Quantity : Unity , plurality , totality . 2 . Of Quality : Reality , negation , limitation . 3 . Of Relation : Substance and accident , cause and effect , action and reaction . 4 . Of Modality : Possibility  --  impossibility , existence  --  non-existence , necessity  --  contingence . These , then , are the fundamental , primary , or native conceptions of the understanding , which flow from , or constitute the mechanism of , its nature ; are inseparable from its activity ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary , or a priori . These categories are " pure " conceptions of the understanding , inasmuch as they are independent of all that is contingent in sense . @# TRANSCENDENTAL DIALECTIC A distinction is usually made between what is immediately known and what is only inferred . It is immediately known that in a figure bounded by three straight lines there are three angles , but that these angles together are equal to two right angles is only inferred . In every syllogism is first a fundamental proposition ; secondly , another deduced from it ; and , thirdly , the consequence . In the use of pure reason its concepts , or transcendental ideas , aim at unity of all conditions of thought . So all transcendental ideas may be arranged in three classes ; the first containing the unity of the thinking subject ; the second , the unity of the conditions of phenomena observed ; the third , the unity of the objective conditions of thought . This classification becomes clear if we note that the thinking subject is the object-matter of psychology ; while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object-matter of cosmology ; and the Being of all Beings ( God ) is the object-matter of theology . Hence we perceive that pure reason supplies three transcendental ideas , namely , the idea of a transcendental science of the soul ( psychologia rationalis ) ; of a transcendental science of the world ( cosmologia rationalis ) ; and , lastly , of a transcendental science of God ( theologia transcendentalis ) . It is the glory of transcendental idealism that by it the mind ascends in the series of conditions till it reaches the unconditioned , that is , the principles . We thus progress from our knowledge of self to a knowledge of the world , and through it to a knowledge of the Supreme Being . @# III .  --  The Antinomies of Pure Reason Transcendental reason attempts to reconcile conflicting assertions . There are four of these antinomies , or conflicts . FIRST ANTINOMY . Thesis . The world has a beginning in time , and is also limited in regard to space . Proof . Were the world without a time-beginning we should have to ascribe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is absurd . Again , were the world not limited in regard to space , it must be conceived as an infinite whole , yet it is impossible thus to conceive it . Antithesis . The world has neither beginning in time , nor limit in space , but in both regards is infinite . Proof . The world must have existed from eternity , or it could never exist at all . If we imagine it had a beginning , we must imagine an anterior time when nothing was . But in such time the origin of anything is impossible . At no moment could any cause for such a beginning exist . SECOND ANTINOMY . Thesis . Every composite substance in the world is composed of simple parts . This thesis seems scarcely to require proof . No one can deny that a composite substance consists of parts , and that these parts , if themselves composite , must consist of others less composite , till at length we come , by compulsion of thought , to the conception of the absolutely simple as that wherein the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world consists of simple parts , and nothing simple exists anywhere in the world . Proof . Each simple part implied in the thesis must be in space . But this condition is a positive disproof of their possibility . A simple substance would have to occupy a simple portion of space ; but space has no simple parts . The supposition of such a part is the supposition , not of space , but of the negation of space . A simple substance , in existing and occupying any portion of space , must contain a real multiplicity of parts external to each other , i.e. , it must contradict its own nature , which is absurd . THIRD ANTINOMY . Thesis . The causality of natural law is insufficient for the explanation of all the phenomena of the universe . For this end another kind of causality must be assumed , whose attribute is freedom . Proof . All so-called natural causes are effects of preceding causes , forming a regressive series of indefinite extent , with no first beginning . So we never arrive at an adequate cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ central demand that nothing shall happen without such a cause . Antithesis . All events in the universe occur under the exclusive operation of natural laws , and there is no such thing as freedom . Proof . The idea of a free cause is an absurdity . For it contradicts the very law of causation itself , which demands that every event shall be in orderly sequence with some preceding event . Now , free causation is such an event , being the active beginning of a series of phenomena . Yet the action of the supposed free cause must be imagined as independent of all connection with any previous event . It is without law or reason , and would be the blind realisation of confusion and lawlessness . Therefore transcendental freedom is a violation of the law of causation , and is in conflict with all experience . We must of necessity acquiesce in the explanation of all phenomena by the operation of natural law , and thus transcendental freedom must be pronounced a fallacy . FOURTH ANTINOMY . Thesis . Some form of absolutely necessary existence belongs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its cause . Proof . Phenomenal existence is serial , mutable , consistent . Every event is contingent upon a preceding condition . The conditioned pre-supposes , for its complete explanation , the unconditioned . The whole of past time , since it contains the whole of all past conditions , must of necessity contain the unconditioned or also " absolutely necessary . " Antithesis . There is no absolutely necessary existence , whether in the world as its part , or outside of it as its cause . Proof . Of unconditionally necessary existence within the world there can be none . The assumption of a first unconditioned link in the chain of cosmical conditions is self-contradictory . For such link or cause , being in time , must be subject to the law of all temporal existence , and so be determined  --  contrary to the original assumption  --  by another link or cause before it . The supposition of an absolutely necessary cause of the world , existing without the world , also destroys itself . For , being outside the world , it is not in time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it must be in time . This supposition is therefore absurd . The theses in these four antinomies constitute the teaching of philosophical dogmatism . The antitheses constitute doctrines of philosophical empiricism . @# IV .  --  Criticism of the Chief Arguments for the Existence of God The ontological argument aims at asserting the possibility of conceiving the idea of an ens realissimum , of being possessed of all reality . But the idea of existence and the fact of existence are two very different things . Whatever I conceive , or sensibly imagine , I necessarily conceive as though it were existing . Though my pocket be empty , I may conceive it to contain a " hundred thalers . " If I conceive them there , I can only conceive them as actually existing there . But , alas , the fact that I am under this necessity of so conceiving by no means carries with it a necessity that the coins should really be in my pocket . That can only be determined by experience . The cosmological argument contends that if anything exists , there must also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I myself exist . Hence there exists an absolutely necessary being . The argument coincides with that by which the thesis of the fourth antinomy is supposed . The objections to it are summed up in the proof of the antithesis of the fourth antimony . As soon as we have recognised the true conception of causality , we have already transcended the sensible world . The physico-theological or teleological argument is what is often styled the argument from design . It proceeds not from general , but particular experience . Nature discloses manifold signs of wise intention and harmonious order , and these are held to betoken a divine designer . This argument deserves always to be treated with respect . It is the oldest and clearest of all proofs , and best adapted to convince the reason of the mass of mankind . It animates us in our study of nature . And it were not only a cheerless , but an altogether vain task to attempt to detract from the persuasive authority of this proof . There is nought to urge against its rationality and its utility . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God must , in order to be theoretically valid , start from specifically and exclusively sensible or phenomenal data , must employ only the conceptions of pure physical science , and must end with demonstrating in sensible experience an object congruous with , or corresponding to , the idea of God . But this requirement can not be met , for , scientifically speaking , the existence of an absolutely necessary God can not be either proved or disproved . Hence room is left for faith in any moral proofs that may present themselves to us , apart from science . With this subject ethics , the science of practice or of practical reason , will have to deal . @# @# The Critique of Practical Reason Kant 's " Critique of Practical Reason " ( " Kritik der praktischen Vernunft " ) , published in 1788 , is one of the most striking disquisitions in the whole range of German metaphysical literature . One of its paragraphs has alone sufficed to render it famous . The passage concerning the starry heavens and the moral law as the two transcendently overwhelming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quoted than any other written by a German author . This is the treatise which forms the central focus of Kant 's thinking . It stands midway between the " Critique of Pure Reason " and the " Critique of Judgment . " Herein Kant takes up the position of a vindicator of the truth of Christianity , approaching his proof of its validity and authority by first establishing positive affirmations of the immortality of the soul and the existence of God . It also includes a theory of happiness , and an argument concerning the summum bonum of life , the special aim being to demonstrate that man should not simply seek to be happy , but should , by absolute obedience to the moral law , seek to become worthy of that happiness which God can bestow . @# I.  --  Analytic of Practical Reason Practical principles are propositions containing a general determination of the will . They are maxims , or subjective propositions , when expressing the will of an individual ; objective , when they are valid expressions of the will of rational beings generally . Practical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or experimental , and supply no practical laws . Reason , in the scope of a practical law , influences the will not by the medium of pleasure or pain . All rational beings necessarily wish for happiness , but they are not all agreed either as to the means to attain it , or as to the objects of their enjoyment of it . Thus , subjective practical principles can only be reckoned as maxims , never as law . A rational being ought not to conceive that his individual maxims are calculated to constitute universal laws , and to become the basis of universal legislation . To discover any law which would bring all men into harmony is absolutely impossible . One of the problems of practical reason is to find the law which can necessarily determine the will , assuming that the will is free . The solution of this problem is to be found in action according to the moral law . We should so act that the maxim of our will can always be valid as a principle of universal legislation . Experience shows how the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone affirms of his inclination for sensual pleasure that he can not possibly resist temptation to indulgence . If a gallows were erected at the place where he is tempted , on which he should be hanged immediately after satiating his passions , would he not be able to control his inclination ? We need not long doubt what would be his answer . But ask him , if his sovereign commanded him to bear false witness against an honourable man , under penalty of death , whether he would hold it possible to conquer his love of life . He might not venture to say what he would choose , but he would certainly admit that it is possible to make choice . Thus , he judges that he can choose to do a thing because he is conscious of moral obligation , and he thus recognises for himself a freedom of will of which , but for the moral law , he would never have been conscious . We obtain the exact opposite of the principle of morality if we adopt the principle of personal private happiness as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only logical , but also practical . For morality would be totally destroyed were not the voice of reason as clear and penetrating in relation to the will , even to the most ordinary men . If one of your friends , after bearing false witness against you , attempted to justify his base conduct by enumerating the advantages which he had thus secured for himself and the happiness he had gained , and by declaring that thus he performed a true human duty , you would either laugh him to scorn or turn from him in horror . And yet , if a man acts for his own selfish ends , you have not the slightest objection to such behaviour . @# MORALITY AND HAPPINESS The maxim of self-love simply advises ; the law of morality commands . There is a vast difference between what we are advised and what we are obliged to do . No practical laws can be based on the principle of happiness , even on that of universal happiness , for the knowledge of this happiness rests on merely empirical or experimental data , every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual opinion . Therefore , this principle of happiness can not prescribe rules for all rational beings . But the moral law demands prompt obedience from everyone , and thus even the most ordinary intelligence can discern what should be done . Everyone has power to comply with the dictates of morality , but even with regard to any single aim it is not easy to satisfy the vague precept of happiness . Nothing could be more absurd than a command that everyone should make himself happy , for one never commands anyone to do what he inevitably wishes to do . Finally , in the idea of our practical reason , there is something which accompanies the violation of a moral law  --  namely , its demerit , with the consciousness that punishment is a natural consequence . Therefore , punishment should be connected in the idea of practical reason with crime , as a consequence of the crime , by the principles of moral legislation . @# ANALYSIS OF PRINCIPLES The practical material principles of determination constituting the basis of morality may be thus classified . 1 . Subjective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Physical feeling ; moral feeling . 2 . Objective Internal : Perfection . External : Will of God . The subjective elements are all experimental , or empirical , and can not supply the universal principle of morality , though they are expounded in that sense by such writers as Montaigne , Mandeville , Epicurus , and Hutcheson . But the objective elements , as enunciated and expounded by Wolf and the Stoics , and by Crusius and other theological moralists , are founded on reason , for absolute perfection as a quality of things ( that is , God Himself ) can only be thought of by rational concepts . The conception of perfection in a practical sense is the adequacy of a thing for various ends . As a human quality ( and so internal ) this is simply talent , and what completes it is skill . But supreme perfection in substance , that is , God Himself , and therefore external ( considered practically ) , is the adequacy of this being for all purposes . All these principles above classified are material , and so can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Divine will can supply a motive in the human mind because of the expectation of happiness from it . Therefore , the formal practical principle of the pure reason insists that the mere form of a universal legislation must constitute the ultimate determining principle of the will . Here is the only possible practical principle which is sufficient to furnish categorical imperatives , that is , practical laws which make action a duty . It follows from this analytic that pure reason can be practical . It can determine the will independently of all merely experimental elements . There is a remarkable contrast between the working of the pure speculative reason and that of the pure practical reason . In the former  --  as was shown in the treatise on that subject  --  a pure , sensible intuition of time and space made knowledge possible , though only of objects of the senses . On the contrary , the moral law brings before us a fact absolutely inexplicable from any of the data of the world of sense . And the entire range of our theoretical use of reason indicates a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and enables us to know something of it  --  namely , a law . We must observe the distinction between the laws of a system of nature to which the will is subject , and of a system of nature which is subject to the will . In the former , the objects cause the ideas which determine the will ; in the latter , the objects are caused by the will . Hence , causality of the will has its determining principle exclusively in the faculty of pure reason , which may , therefore , also be called a pure practical reason . The moral law is a law of the causality through freedom , and therefore of the possibility of a super-sensible system of nature . It determines the will by imposing on its maxim the condition of a universal legislative form , and thus it is able for the first time to impart practical reality to reason , which otherwise would continue to be transcendent when seeking to proceed speculatively with its ideas . Thus the moral law induces a stupendous change . It changes the transcendent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result reason itself becomes , by its ideas , an efficient cause in the field of experience . @# HUME AND SCEPTICISM It may be said of David Hume that he initiated the attack on pure reason . My own labours in the investigation of this subject were occasioned by his sceptical teaching , for his assault made them necessary . He argued that without experience it is impossible to know the difference between one thing and another ; that is , we can know a priori , and , therefore , the notion of a cause is fictitious and illusory , arising only from the habit of observing certain things associated with each in succession of connections . On such principles we can never come to any conclusion as to causes and effects . We can never predict a consequence from any of the known attributes of things . We can never say of any event that it must necessarily have followed from another ; that is , that it must have had an antecedent cause . And we could never lay down a rule derived even from the greatest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blind chance , abolishing all reason , and such a surrender establishes scepticism in an impregnable citadel . Mathematics escaped Hume , because he considered that its propositions were analytical , proceeding from one determination to another , by reason of identity contained in each . But this is not really so , for , on the contrary , they are synthetical , the results depending ultimately on the assent of observers as witnesses to the universality of propositions . So Hume 's empiricism leads inevitably to scepticism even in this realm . My investigations led me to the conclusion that the objects with which we are familiar are by no means things in themselves , but are simply phenomena , connected in a certain way with experience . So that without contradiction they can not be separated from that connection . Only by that experience can they be recognised . I was able to prove the objective reality of the concept of cause in regard to objects of experience , and to demonstrate its origin from pure understanding , without experimental or empirical sources . Thus , I first destroyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself . And thus was subverted the thorough doubt as to whatever theoretic reason claims to perceive , as well as the claim of Hume that the concept of causality involved something absolutely unthinkable . @# GOOD AND EVIL By a concept of practical reason , I understand the representation to the mind of an object as an effect possible to be produced through freedom . The only objects of practical reason are good and evil . For by " good " we understand an object necessarily abhorred , the principle of reason actuating the mind in each case . In the common use of language we uniformly distinguish between the " good " and the " pleasant , " the " evil " and the " unpleasant , " good and evil being judged by reason alone . The judgment on the relation , of means to ends certainly belongs to reason . But " good " or " evil " always implies only a reference to the " will , " as resolved by the law of reason , to make something its object . Thus good and evil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So , if anything is to be reckoned simply good or evil , it can only be so estimated by the way of acting . Hence , only the maxim of the will , and consequently the person himself , can be called good or evil , not the thing itself . The Stoic was right , even though he might be laughed at , who during violent attacks of gout exclaimed , " Pain , I will never admit that thou art an evil ! " What he felt was indeed what we call a bad thing ; but he had no reason to admit that any evil attached thereby to himself , for the pain did not in the least detract from his personal worth , but only from that of his condition . If a single lie had been on his conscience it would have humiliated his soul ; but pain seemed only to elevate it , when he was not conscious of having deserved it as a punishment for any unjust deed . The rule of judgment subject to the laws of pure practical reason is this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to happen by a natural system of law , of which you were yourself a part , you could regard it as possible by your own will ? In fact , everyone does decide by this rule whether actions are morally good or evil . @# II .  --  Dialectic of Practical Reason @# THE IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL Pure practical reason postulates the immortality of the soul , for reason in the pure and practical sense aims at the perfect good ( summum bonum ) , and this perfect good is only possible on the supposition of the soul 's immortality . It is the moral law which determines the will , and , in this will , the perfect harmony of the mind with the moral law , is the supreme condition of the summum bonum . The principle of the moral destination of our nature  --  that only by endless progress can we come into full harmony with the moral law  --  is of the greatest use , not only for fortifying the speculative reason , but also with respect to religion . In default of this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being represented as indulging our convenience , or else men strain after an unattainable aim , hoping to gain absolute holiness of will , thus losing themselves in fanatical theosophic dreams utterly contradicting self-knowledge . For a rational , but finite , being the only possibility is an endless progression from the lower to the higher degrees of perfection . The Infinite Being , to whom the time-condition is nothing , sees in this endless succession the perfect harmony with the moral law . @# THE EXISTENCE OF GOD The pure practical reason must also postulate the existence of God as the necessary condition of the attainment of the summum bonum . As the perfect good can only be promoted by accordance of the will with the moral law , so also this summum bonum is possible only through the supremacy of an Infinite Being possessed of causality harmonising with morality . But the postulate of the highest derived good ( sometimes denominated the best world ) coincides with the postulate of a highest original good , or of the existence of God . We now perceive why the Greeks could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bonum , because they made the freedom of the human will the only and all-sufficient ground of happiness , imagining there was no need for the existence of God for that end . Christianity alone affords an idea of the summum bonum which answers fully to the requirement of practical reason . That idea is the Kingdom of God . The holiness which the Christian law requires makes essential an infinite progress . But just for that very reason it justifies in man the hope of endless existence . And it is only from an Infinite Supreme Being , morally perfect , holy , good , and with an omnipotent will , that we can hope , by accord with His will , to attain the summum bonum , which the moral law enjoins on us as our duty to seek ever to attain . The moral law does not enjoin on us to render ourselves happy , but instructs us how to become worthy of happiness . Morality must never be regarded as a doctrine of happiness , or direction how to become happy , its province being to inculcate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attaining it . God 's design in creating the world is not primarily the happiness of the rational beings in it , but the summum bonum , which super-adds another condition to that desire of human beings , namely , the condition of deserving such happiness . That is to say , the morality of rational beings is a condition which alone includes the rule by observing which they can hope to participate in happiness at the hand of an all-wise Creator . The highest happiness can only be conceived as possible under conditions harmonising with the divine holiness . Thus they are right who make the glory of God the chief end of creation . For beyond all else that can be conceived , that glorifies God which is the most estimable thing in the whole world , honour for His command and obedience to His law , when to this is added His glorious design to crown so beauteous an order of things with happiness corresponding . @# CONCLUSION Two things fill the mind with ever new and increasing wonder and awe  --  the starry heavens above me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ search for them , and vaguely guess concerning them , as if they were veiled in darkness or hidden in the infinite altitude . I see them before me , and link them immediately with the consciousness of my existence . The former begins from the spot I occupy in the outer world of sense , and enlarges my connection with it to a boundless extent with worlds upon worlds and systems of systems . The second begins from my invisible self , my personality , and places me in a truly infinite world traceable only by the understanding , with which I perceive I am in a universal and necessary connection , as I am also thereby with all those visible worlds . This view infinitely elevates my value as an intelligence by my personality , in which the moral law reveals to me a life independent of the animal and even the whole material world , and reaching by destiny into the infinite . But though admiration may stimulate inquiry , it can not compensate for the want of it . The contemplation of the world , beginning with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and morality , beginning with the noblest attribute of human nature , ended in superstition . But after reason was applied to careful examination of the phenomena of nature a clear and unchangeable insight was secured into the system of the world . We may entertain the hope of a like good result in treating of the moral capacities of our nature by the help of the moral judgment of reason . @# @# GEORGE HENRY LEWES A History of Philosophy George Henry Lewes , born in London on April 18 , 1817 , was the grandson of a famous Covent Garden comedian . As an actor , philosopher , novelist , critic , dramatist , journalist , man of science , Lewes played many parts in the life of his time , and some of them he played very well . George Eliot owed him a great deal ; he turned her genius away from pure speculation , and directed it to its true province  --  fiction . Lewes was , in fact , an excellent critic , and it is by his splendid critical work , the " Biographical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembered . In this remarkable book , which appeared in 1845-46 , Lewes the novelist and the journalist collaborates with Lewes the philosopher and man of science . He has the rare art of making an abstruse subject clear and attractive ; he does not give a dry summary of the ideas of the great thinkers , but depicts the living man and relates his way of life to his way of thinking . The result is that in his hands metaphysic becomes as interesting as history did in the hands of Macaulay. @# I.  --  The Early Thinkers It is the object of the present work to show how philosophy became a positive science ; to indicate by what methods the human mind was enabled to conquer its present modicum of certain knowledge . The boldest and the grandest speculations came first . Man needed the stimulus of some higher reward than that of merely tracing the laws of phenomena . Nothing but a solution of the mystery of the universe could content him . Astronomy was derived from astrology : chemistry from alchemy , and physiology from auguries . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that of the great initiative to positive science . It was the forlorn hope of mankind , and though it perished in its efforts , it did not perish without having led the way to victory . Thales , who was born at Miletus , in Asia Minor , and flourished in 585 B.C. , is justly considered the father of Greek speculation . The step he took was small but decisive . He opened the physiological inquiry into the constitution of the universe . Seeing around him constant transformations  --  birth and death , change of shape , of size , and of mode of being , he could not regard any one of these variable states of existence as existence itself . He therefore asked , What is the beginning of things ? Finding that all things were nourished by moisture , he declared that moisture was the principle of everything . He was mistaken , of course , but he was the first man to furnish a formula from which to reason deductively . Anaximenes ( 550 B.C. ) pursued the method of Thales , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctrine . He thought that the air was the prime , universal element , from which all things were produced and into which all things were resolved . Diogenes of Apollonia adopted the idea of Anaximenes , but gave a deeper significance to it . The older thinker conceived the vital air as a kind of soul ; the younger man conceived the soul as a kind of air  --  an invisible force , permeating and actuating everything . This attribution of intelligence to the primal power or matter was certainly a progress in speculation ; but another line of thought was struck out by Anaximander of Miletus , who had been a friend of Thales . He was passionately addicted to mathematics , and a great many inventions are ascribed to him ; among others , the sun-dial and the geographical map . In his view , any one single thing could not be all things , and in his famous saying , " The infinite is the origin of all things , " he introduced into metaphysics an abstract conception in place of the inadequate concrete principles of Thales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , like him , one of the great founders of mathematics . He held that the only permanent reality in the cosmos was the principle of order and harmony , which prevented the universe from becoming a blank , unintelligible chaos ; and he expressed this idea in his mystic doctrine : " Numbers are the cause of the material existence of things . " The movement which he spread by means of a vast , secret confraternity ended , however , in a barren symbolism , and it is impossible to trace what relation his strange theories of the transmigration of souls and the music of the spheres have to his general system of thought . Far more influence on the progress of speculation was exercised by Xenophanes of Colophon . Driven by the Persian invasion of 546 B.C. to earn his living as a wandering minstrel , he developed the ideas of Anaximander , and founded the school of great philosophic poets , to which Parmenides , Empedocles and Lucretius belong . He is the grand monotheist , and he has published his doctrines in his verses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirits and mortals , Neither in body to mankind resembling , neither in ideas . Shelley 's line : " The One remains , the Many change and pass , " sums up the teaching of the line of thinkers which culminated in Plato . In their view , knowledge derived from the senses was fallacious because it touched only the diverse and changing appearances of things ; absolute knowledge of the one abiding spiritual reality could , they held , only be obtained by the exercise of spiritual faculty of reason , which , unlike the animal power of sense , is the same in all men . One of the philosophers of this school , Zeno of Elea , was the inventor of the dialectic method of logic , which Socrates and Plato used with so tremendous an effect . Anaxagoras , however , attempted to reconcile the evidence of the sense with the dictates of the reason . He was the first philosopher to settle in Athens , and Pericles , Euripides , and Socrates were among his pupils . He was extraordinarily modern in many of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ derived through the senses , but that reason regulated and verified it , and he carried this dualism into his conception of the universe , which he represented as a manifestation of a Divine intelligence , acting through invariable laws , but in no way confused with the matter acted on . His successor , Democritus , adopted his theory of the origin of knowledge , and by applying it to the problem of the One and the Many , produced the most striking of ancient anticipations of modern science . He regarded the world as something made up of invisible particles , each absolutely similar to the other ; these formed the essential unity which could be grasped only by the reason , but by their various combinations and arrangements they brought about the apparent multiplicity of objects which the senses perceived . Such was the foundation of the atomic theory of Democritus . He conceived the atom as a centre of force , and not as a particle having weight and material qualities . As , however , his hypothesis was purely a metaphysical one , it did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the establishment of the modern scientific theory , which was arrived at in a different way , and has a different signification . Democritus also threw out in vague outline the idea of gravitation . But this was not science : it was guess-work ; it afforded no ground on which the fabric of verified knowledge could be erected , and no sure method of obtaining this knowledge . @# II .  --  The School of Socrates It was against the vain and premature hypotheses of the physiologists of his day that the greatest and noblest intellect in Greece revolted . Socrates was the knight-errant of philosophy . It was his confessed aim and purpose to withdraw the mind from the contemplation of the phenomena of nature , and fix it on its own phenomena . " I have not leisure for physical speculations , " he said , with characteristic irony , " and I will tell you why : I am not yet able , according to the Delphic inscription , to know myself , and it seems to me very ridiculous , while ignorant of myself , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Weary of disputes about the origin of the universe , he turned to the one field in which the current method of abstract reasoning could be fruitfully applied  --  the field of ethics . Living in an age of wild sophistry , he endeavoured to steady and enlighten the conscience of men by establishing right principles of conduct . His method of proceeding by definitions and analogy has been misapplied , but in his hands it was a powerful instrument in discovering and marking out a new field of inquiry . His religious genius , the ideal character of his ethics , and the heroic character of his life , have been his great titles to fame , but it is his method which gives him his high position in the history of philosophy . The method of Socrates was adopted and enlarged by the most famous of all ancient writers . Aristocles , surnamed Plato ( the broad-browed ) , was a brilliant young Athenian aristocrat who turned from poetry to philosophy on meeting , in his twentieth year , with Socrates . After travelling abroad in search of knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there in 387 B.C. With vast learning and puissant method , he created an influence which is not yet extinct Plato was the culminating point of Greek philosophy . In his works all the various and conflicting tendencies of preceding eras were collected under one method . This method was doubtless the method of Socrates , but much extended and improved . Socrates relied on definitions and analogical reasoning as the principles of investigation . Plato used these arts , but he added to them the more scientific processes of analysis , generalisation , and classification . In regard to his system of thought , Plato was a realist . He believed that ideas have a real existence , and that material things are only copies of the realities existing in the ideal world . He held that beauty , goodness , and wisdom are spiritual realities , from which all things beautiful , good , and wise derive their existence . In his philosophy the universe is divided into the celestial region of ideas and the mundane region of material phenomena , answering to the modern conception of heaven and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ideas ( not , as some suppose , the bodily realisation of them ) , there arises a question : How do ideas become matter ? Plato gives two different explanations . In the " Republic " he says that God , instead of perpetually creating individual things , created a distinct type ( idea ) for each thing , and from this type all objects of the class are made . But in a later work , the " Timaeus , " Plato takes another view of the origin of the world . Types are conceived as having existed from all eternity , and God , in fashioning cosmos out of chaos , fashioned it after the model of these eternal types . Plato 's conception of heaven and earth as two distinct regions is completed by his conception of the double nature of the soul ; or , rather , of two souls , one rational and the other sensitive . The sensitive soul awakens the divine reminiscences of the rational soul ; and the rational soul , by detecting the One in the Many , preserves man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who was born in 384 B.C. , was Plato 's pupil . He , however , completely broke away from his master 's theory . He maintained that individual objects alone exist . But if only individual objects exist , only by the senses can they be known ; and if we have only sense-knowledge , how can we arrive at the general truths on which both philosophy and science are founded ? This was the problem which had led Plato to claim for ideas , or types of general truths , a higher origin than the intermittent and varying data of the senses . Aristotle held that it could be solved in a natural way without the conception of an ideal world . In his view , ideas were obtained by induction . Sensation is the basis of all knowledge . But we have another faculty besides that of sensation ; we have memory . Having perceived many objects , we remember our perceptions , and this enables us to discern wherein things differ and wherein they agree . Then , by means of the art of induction , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is clearly explained by him : " Experience furnishes the principles of every science . Thus astronomy is grounded on observation . For if we were to observe properly the phenomena of the heavens , we might demonstrate the laws which regulate them . The same applies to other sciences . " Had he always held before his eyes this conception of science , he would have anticipated Bacon  --  he would have been the Father of Positive Science . But he could not confine himself to experience , as there was not sufficient experience accumulated in his age from which to generalise with any effect . So he turned to logic as an instrument for investigating the mystery of existence , and by bringing physics and metaphysics together again , he paved the way for a new era  --  the era of scepticism . All the wisdom of the ancient world was powerless against the sceptics . Faith in truth was extinct ; faith in human nature was gone ; philosophy was impossible . And , though the influence of Socrates continued to be felt in the field of ethics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and egotistical . What a light was poured upon all questions of morality by that one divine axiom , " Love your enemy . " No Greek ever attained the sublimity of such a point of view . Still , the progress made by the Greeks was immense , and they must ever occupy in the history of humanity an honourable place . @# III .  --  Philosophy and Science Francis Bacon is the father of experimental philosophy . He owes his title to his method . Many philosophers , ancient and modern , had cursorily referred to observation and experiment as furnishing the materials of physical knowledge ; but no one before him had attempted to systematise the true method of discovery . He begins his great work by examining into the permanent causes of error , as these were likely to be operative even after the reformation of science . For this reason he calls them idols , or false appearances ( from the Greek , eidolon ) , and he divides them into four classes : the idols of the tribe , or the causes of error due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idols of the den , which spring from weaknesses peculiar to the character of the individual student ; the idols of the forum , which arise out of the intercourse of society and the power that words sometimes have of governing thought ; and , finally , the idols of the theatre , which men of great learning pursue when they follow the systems of famous but mistaken thinkers . After this preliminary discussion , Bacon goes on to describe the methods of inductive science . The first step consists in preparing a history of the phenomena to be explained in all their modifications and varieties . This history must include not merely such facts as spontaneously offer themselves , but all experiments instituted for the sake of discovery . It must be composed with great care ; the facts should be accurately related and distinctly arranged , and their authenticity diligently examined ; those that rest on doubtful evidence should not be rejected , but noted as uncertain , with the grounds of the judgment so formed . This last part of the method , says Bacon , is very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are ill-informed , and they cease to seem marvellous when our knowledge is further extended . When this record of facts , this " natural history , " is completed , an attempt may then be made to discover , by a comparison of the various facts , the cause of the phenomena . Here it is of the utmost importance to bear in mind that all facts have not the same value . There are , as Bacon points out , twenty-seven species of facts , and he concludes that in any science where facts can not be tested by experiment there can be no conclusive evidence . Thus it will be seen that Bacon 's method was a system of specific rules . He did not merely tell men to make observations and experiments ; he taught them how observations and experiments ought to be made . As Bacon was the father of modern science , so Rene Descartes was the father of modern philosophy . Born in 1596 , and perplexed by the movement of scepticism produced by the Renaissance , the French thinker endeavoured to find some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew of his own existence . Hence his famous saying : Cogito , ergo sum  --  " I think , therefore I exist . " Consciousness , said he , is the basis of all knowledge . The process then is simple : examine your consciousness , and its clear replies will be science . Hence the vital portion of his system lies in this axiom : " All clear ideas are true . " The fallacy in his system can be briefly exposed . Consciousness is , no doubt , the ultimate ground of certainty of existence for me . But though I am conscious of all that passes within myself , I am not conscious of what passes in anything not myself . All that I can possibly know of anything not myself lies in its effects upon me . Any other ideas I may have in regard to the outside world are founded only on inferences , and directly I leave the ground of consciousness for the region of inference my knowledge becomes questionable . It was this defect in Cartesianism which Baruch Spinoza , the great Jewish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked himself : What was the reality which lies beneath all appearance ? We see everywhere transformations perishable and perishing , yet there must be something beneath which is imperishable and immutable . What is it ? In Spinoza 's view , the absolute existence is God . All that exists , exists in and by God . Taking the words of St. Paul , " In Him we live and move and have our being , " as his motto , he undertook to trace the relations of the world to God and to man , and those of man to society . To John Locke , born at Wrington , in Somerset , in 1632 , the problem presented itself in another way . Instead of accepting the validity of clear ideas , as Descartes and Spinoza did , he adopted the Baconian method , and opened the inquiry into the origin and formation of ideas . Separating himself from the philosophers who held that the mind was capable of arriving at knowledge independent of experience , and from the sceptics who maintained that the senses were the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from two sources  --  sensation and reflection . He was succeeded by George Berkeley , Bishop of Cloyne , born at Kilcrin in Kilkenny , in 1684 . He defeated the sceptics on their own ground . There is nothing in the world , he says , except our own sensations and ideas . In order to exist for us , things have to be perceived by the mind ; therefore , everything , in order to exist , must exist in the mind of God . But when Berkeley had proved that matter was figment , David Hume , born in 1711 , came forward and showed that mind was also an illusion . You know nothing of matter , said Berkeley ; you have only perceptions and the ideas based thereon . You know nothing of mind , replied Hume ; you have only a succession of sensations and ideas . Against Hume rose up in Germany a famous school of philosophers beginning with Immanuel Kant , who was born in Prussia in 1724 . Kant attempted to prove that the human reason was not untrustworthy , as Hume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bounds , it was capable of arriving at practical truths . Kant 's disciples , however , were not content with this modest restatement . Taking it too readily for granted that Hume 's objections had been overcome , they proceeded to revive that unbounded faith in mere speculation which had been the distemper of the Greek mind . Fichte and Schelling were the first thinkers of note to attempt again to solve by logic the mystery of the universe . But their works are now obscured by the achievement of Hegel , who began to teach at Berlin in 1818 . Hegel holds that the real universe is a universe of ideas to which his philosophy is the key , but , as ideas realise themselves in space and time , they come within the scope of the man of science . It is said that all bad German systems of philosophy when they die come to England . Hegelianism has certainly been very fashionable in this country , and its influence is still observable in academic circles . Auguste Comte is the Bacon of the nineteenth century . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is to say , a doctrine capable of embracing all the sciences , and , with them , all the problems of social life . He holds that every branch of knowledge passes through three stages : the supernatural , or fictitious ; the metaphysical or abstract ; the positive or scientific . When the positive method is adopted , then shall we again have one general doctrine , powerful because general . The metaphysicians have failed to penetrate to the causes of things , but the men of science are succeeding in the humbler but far more useful work of tracing some of the laws that govern the phenomena of nature , and foreseeing their operations . It is only where the philosophers started matters capable of positive treatment that any advance has been made in metaphysics . For the rest , philosophy leaves us in the nineteenth century at precisely the same point at which we were in the fifth . Thus is the circle completed . @# @# JOHN LOCKE Concerning the Human Understanding John Locke was born at Wrington , Somersetshire , England , Aug. 29 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christ Church , Oxford ; but his temperament rebelled against the system of education still in vogue and the public disputations of the schools , which he thought " invented for wrangling and ostentation rather than to discover truth . " It was his study of Descartes that first " gave him a relish of philosophical things . " From 1683 to 1689 he found it prudent to sojourn in Holland . In the latter year he returned to England , bringing with him the manuscript of the " Essay Concerning Human Understanding , " which appeared in the spring of 1690 . Few works of philosophy have made their way more rapidly than the " Essay . " Twenty editions appeared before 1700 . The design of the book , Locke explains in the introduction , is to inquire " into the origin , certainty , and extent of human knowledge , together with the grounds and degrees of belief , opinion , and assent . " Locke died on October 28 , 1704. @# I.  --  The Nature of Simple Ideas " Idea " being that term which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the object of the understanding . I have used it to express whatever is meant by phantasm , notion , species , or whatever it is the mind can be employed about in thinking . Let us , then , suppose the mind to be , as we say , white paper void of all characters  --  without any ideas . Whence comes it by that vast store which the busy and boundless fancy of man has painted on it with an almost endless variety ? To this , I answer in one word  --  Experience ; in that all our knowledge is founded , and from that it ultimately derives itself . Let anyone examine his own thoughts and thoroughly search his understanding , and then let him tell me whether of all the original ideas he has there are any other than of the objects of his senses , or of the observations of his mind considered as objects of his reflection . Though the qualities that affect our senses are , in the things themselves , so united and blended that there is no separation , no distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce in the mind enter by the senses simple and unmixed . For , though the sight and touch often take in from the same object at the same time different ideas , yet the simple ideas thus united in the same subject are as perfectly distinct as those that come in by different senses ; the coldness and hardness which a man feels in a piece of ice being as distinct ideas in the mind as the smell and whiteness of a lily , and each of them being in itself uncompounded , contains nothing but one uniform appearance , or conception , in the mind , and is not distinguishable into different ideas . When the understanding is once stored with these simple ideas , it has the power to repeat , compare , and unite them even to an almost infinite variety , and so can make at will new complex ideas . But it is not in the power of any most exalted wit or enlarged understanding , by any quickness or variety of thought , to invent or frame one new simple idea in the mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have anyone try to fancy any taste which had never affected his palate , or frame the idea of a scent he had never smelt ; and when he can do this , I will also conclude that a blind man hath ideas of colours and a deaf man true , distinct notions of sound . There are some ideas which have admittance only through one sense which is peculiarly adapted to receive them . Thus , light and colours come in only by the eye , all kinds of noises by the ear , the tastes and smells by the nose and palate . The most considerable of those belonging to the touch are heat , cold , and solidity  --  which is the idea that belongs to the body , whereby we conceive it to fill space . Simple ideas of divers senses are the ideas of space or extension , figure , rest , and motion , for these make perceivable impressions both on the eyes and touch , and we can receive and convey into our minds the ideas of the extension , figure , motion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The mind , receiving the ideas mentioned in the foregoing from without , when it turns its view inward upon itself and observes its own actions about those ideas it has , takes from thence other ideas which are as capable to be the objects of its contemplation as any of those it received from foreign things . The two great and principal actions of the mind which are most frequently considered , and which are so frequent that everyone that pleases may take notice of them in himself , are these two  --  Perception or Thinking , and Volition or Will . The power of thinking is called the Understanding , and the power of volition is called the Will . And these two powers , or abilities , in the mind are denominated Faculties . Some of the modes of these simple ideas of reflection are remembrance , discerning , reasoning , judging , knowledge , faith . It has , further , pleased our wise Creator to annex to several objects and to the ideas which we receive from them , as also to several of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objects to several degrees , that those faculties which He has endowed us with might not remain wholly idle and unemployed by us . Pain has the same efficacy and use to set us on work that pleasure has , we being as ready to employ our faculties to avoid that as to pursue this . Existence and unity are two other ideas that are suggested to the understanding by every object without and every idea within . Power , also , is another of those simple ideas which we receive from sensation and reflection ; and , besides these , there is succession . Nor let anyone think these too narrow bounds for the capacious mind of man to expatiate in , which takes its flight farther than the stars and can not be confined by the limits of the world , that extends its thoughts often even beyond the utmost expansion of matter and makes excursions into that incomprehensible inane . Nor will it be so strange to think these few simple ideas sufficient to employ the quickest thought or largest capacity if we consider how many words may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; or if , going one step farther , we will but reflect on the variety of combinations that may be made with barely one of the above-mentioned ideas , viz. , number , whose stock is inexhaustible . And what a large and immense field doth extension alone afford the mathematicians ! @# II .  --  Of Idea-Producing Qualities The power to produce any idea in our mind I call Quality of the subject wherein that power is . Qualities are , first , such as are utterly inseparable from the body in what state soever it be . These I call original or primary qualities , which I think we may observe to produce simple ideas in us , viz. , solidity , extension , figure , motion or rest , and number . Secondly , such qualities which in truth are nothing in the objects themselves , but powers to produce various sensations in us by their primary qualities , i.e. , by the bulk , figure , texture , and motion of their insensible parts . These secondary qualities are colours , sounds , tastes , etc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this observation : that the ideas of primary qualities of bodies are resemblances of them , but the ideas produced in us by the secondary qualities have no resemblance in them at all . If anyone will consider that the same fire that at one distance produces in us the sensation of warmth does , at a nearer approach , produce in us the far different sensation of pain , let him bethink himself what reason he has to say that his idea of warmth , which was produced in him by fire , is actually in the fire ; and his idea of pain which the same fire produced in him in the same way , is not in the fire . The particular bulk , number , figure , and motion of the parts of fire or snow are really in them , whether anyone 's senses perceive them or not ; and , therefore , they may be called real qualities , because they really exist in those bodies . But light , heat , whiteness , or coldness are no more really in them than sickness or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them ; let not the eyes see light or colours , nor the ears hear sounds ; let the palate not taste , nor the nose smell ; and all colours , tastes , odours , and sounds , as they are such particular ideas , vanish and cease , and are reduced to their causes , i.e. , bulk , figure , and motion of parts . @# III .  --  Various Faculties of the Mind What perception is everyone will know better by reflecting on what he does himself when he sees , hears , feels , etc. , or thinks , than by any discourse of mine . This is certain , that whatever alterations are made in the body , if they reach not the mind , whatever impressions are made on the outward parts , if they are not taken notice of within , there is no perception . We ought further to consider concerning perception , that the ideas we receive by sensation are often in grown people altered by the judgment without our taking any notice of it . When we set before our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gold , alabaster , or jet  --  it is certain that the idea thereby imprinted in our mind is of a flat circle variously shadowed with several degrees of light and brightness coming to our eyes . But we having by use been accustomed to perceive what kind of appearances convex bodies are wont to make in us , what alterations are made in the reflections of light by the difference of the sensible figures of bodies , the judgment presently , by an habitual custom , alters the appearances into their causes ; so that from that which is truly a variety of shadow or colour collecting the figure , it makes it pass for a mark of figure , and frames to itself the perception of a convex figure and a uniform colour , when the idea we receive from thence is only a plane variously coloured , as is evident in painting . Perception , then , is the first operation of our intellectual faculties , and the inlet of all knowledge into our minds . The next faculty of the mind whereby it makes a further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the keeping of those simple ideas which from sensation or reflection it hath received . This is done , first , by keeping the idea which is brought into it for some time actually in view , which is called Contemplation . The other way of retention is the power to revive again in our minds those ideas which after imprinting have disappeared , or have been , as it were , laid aside out of sight ; and thus we do when we conceive heat or light , yellow or sweet , the object being removed . This is memory , which is , as it were , the storehouse of our ideas . Another faculty we may take notice of in our minds is that of Discerning , and distinguishing between the several ideas it has . It is not enough to have a confused perception of something in general . Unless the mind had a distinct perception of different objects and their qualities , it would be capable of very little knowledge , though the bodies that affect us were as busy about us as they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On this faculty of distinguishing one thing from another depends the evidence and certainty of several even very general propositions which have passed for innate truths , because men , overlooking the true cause why those propositions find universal assent , impute it wholly to native uniform impressions ; whereas it , in truth , depends upon this clear discerning faculty of the mind , whereby it perceives two ideas to be the same or different . The comparing of ideas one with another is the operation of the mind upon which depends all that large tribe of ideas comprehended under relations . The next operation is composition , whereby the mind puts together several simple ideas and combines them into complex ones . The use of words being to stand as outward marks of our internal ideas , and those ideas being taken from particular things , if every particular idea that we take in should have a distinct name , names must be endless . To prevent this , the mind makes the particular ideas received from particular objects to become general , which is done by considering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appearances separate from all other existences , and from the circumstances of real existence , as time , place , or any other concomitant ideas . This is called Abstraction , whereby ideas taken from particular being become general representatives of all of the same kind . Thus , the same colour being observed to-day in chalk or snow which the mind yesterday received from milk , it considers that that appearance alone makes it a representative of all of that kind ; and having given it the name " whiteness , " it by that sound signifies the same quality wheresoever imagined or met with ; and thus universals , whether ideas or terms , are made . As the mind is wholly passive in the reception of all its simple ideas , so it exerts several acts of its own , whereby , out of its simple ideas , as the materials and foundations of the rest the others are framed . And I believe we shall find , if we observe the originals of our notions , that even the most abstruse ideas , how remote soever they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our minds , are yet only such as the understanding frames to itself , by repeating and joining together ideas that it had either from objects of sense or from its own operations about them ; so that even those large and abstract ideas are derived from sensation or reflection , being no other than what the mind may and does attain by the ordinary use of its own faculties . @# IV .  --  Knowledge of the Existence of Other Things It is the actual receiving of ideas from without that gives us notice of the existence of other things , and makes us know that something does exist at that time without us which causes that idea in us , though perhaps we neither know nor consider how it does it . And this , though not so certain as our own intuitive knowledge , or as the deductions of our reason employed about the clear abstract ideas of our own minds , yet deserves the name of knowledge . It is plain that those perceptions are produced by exterior causes affecting our senses for the following reasons . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can have the ideas belonging to that sense produced in their minds . Because sometimes I find I can not avoid having those ideas produced in my mind ; for as when my eyes are shut , or the windows fast , I can at pleasure recall to my mind the ideas of light or the sun which former sensations have lodged in my memory ; so I can at pleasure lay by that idea and take into my view that of a rose or taste of sugar . But if I turn my eyes at noon towards the sun , I can not avoid the ideas which the light or sun produces in me . There is nobody who does not perceive the difference in himself contemplating the sun as he has an idea of it in his memory and actually looking upon it ; and , therefore , he has certain knowledge that they are not both memory or the actions of his mind and fancies only within him , but that actual seeing has a cause without . Add to this that many of those ideas are produced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offence . Lastly , our senses bear witness to the truth of each other 's report concerning the existence of sensible things without us. @# @# MONTAIGNE Essays Michel Eyquem , Seigneur de Montaigne , one of the greatest masters of the essay in all literature , was born at his family 's ancestral chateau near Bordeaux , in France , Feb. 28 , 1533 , and died on September 13 , 1592 . His life was one of much suffering from hereditary disease , which , however , he endured so philosophically that little trace of his trials is apparent in his writings . His father , who is said to have been of English descent , took special pains with his early education , having had him taught Latin by a German tutor before he learnt French , so that before he " left his nurse 's arms " he was a master of the ancient tongue and knew not a word of his own . The first two of the three books of his celebrated " Essays " were published in 1581 and the third in 1588 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizen , and the next year he was chosen Mayor of Bordeaux . Always a lover of books and a student of men , his writings are a rich mine of scholarly wit and worldly wisdom , consummate in the naturalness that conceals literary art . Like most works of the time , they contain passages which modern taste does not approve , but , taken as a whole , they are among the most interesting of books of the kind . @# I.  --  Of Death , and How It Findeth a Man I was born between eleven of the clock and noon , the last of February , 1533 , according to our computation , the year beginning on January 1 . It is but a fortnight since I was thirty-nine years old . I want at least as much more of life . If in the meantime I should trouble my thoughts with a matter so far from me as death , it were but folly . Of those renowned in life I will lay a wager I will find more that have died before they came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has death to surprise us ! Who would ever have imagined that a Duke of Brittany should have become stifled to death in a throng of people , as whilom was a neighbour of mine at Lyons when Pope Clement made his entrance there ? Hast thou not seen one of our late kings slain in the midst of his sports ? and one of his ancestors die miserably by the throw of a hog ? AEschylus , fore-threatened by the fall of a house , when he was most on his guard , was struck dead by the fall of a tortoise-shell from the talons of a flying eagle . Another was choked by a grape-pip . An emperor died from the scratch of a comb , AEmilius Lepidus from hitting his foot against a door-sill , Anfidius from stumbling against the door as he was entering the council chamber . Caius Julius , a physician , while anointing a patient 's eyes had his own closed by death . And if among these examples I may add one of a brother of mine , Captain St. Martin , playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little above the right ear , and without any appearance of bruise or hurt , never sitting or resting , died within six hours afterwards of an apoplexy . These so frequent and ordinary examples being ever before our eyes , why should it not continually seem to us that death is ever at hand ready to take us by the throat ? What matter is it , will you say unto me , how and in what manner it is , so long as a man do not trouble and vex himself therewith ? It sufficeth me to live at my ease , and the best recreation I can have that do I ever take . It is uncertain where death looks for us : let us look for her everywhere . The premeditation of death is a fore-thinking of liberty . He who has learned to die has unlearned to serve . There is no evil in life for him who has well conceived that the privation of life is no evil . I am now , by the mercy of God , in such a taking that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am prepared to dislodge whensoever He shall please to call me . No man did ever prepare himself to quit the world more simply and fully . The deadest deaths are the best . * * * * * Were I a composer of books I would keep a register of divers deaths , which , in teaching me to die , should afterwards teach them to live . My father in his household order had this , which I can commend , though I in no way follow . Besides the day-book of household affairs , wherein are registered at least expenses , payments , gifts , bargains , and sales that require not a notary 's hand to them  --  of which book a receiver had the keeping  --  he appointed another journal-book to one of his servants , who was his clerk , wherein he should orderly set down all occurences worthy of the noting , and day by day register the memories of the history of his house  --  a thing very pleasant to read when time began to wear out the remembrance of them , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to resolve some doubts : when such and such a work was begun , when ended ; what way or course was taken , what accidents happened , how long it continued ; all our voyages and journeys , where , and how long we were away from home ; our marriages ; who died , and when ; the receiving of good or bad tidings ; who came , who went ; changing or removing of household officers , taking of new or discharging of old servants , and such matters . An ancient custom , and a sound one , which I would have all men use and bring into fashion again . @# II .  --  In My Library Intercourse with books comforts me in age and solaces me in solitariness , eases me of weariness and rids me of tedious company . To divert importunate thoughts there is no better way than recourse to books . And though they perceive I on occasion forsake them , they never mutiny or murmur , but welcome me always with the self-same visage . I never travel , whether in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonderful what repose I find in the knowledge that they are at my elbow to delight me when time shall serve . In this human peregrination this is the best munition I have found . At home I betake me somewhat oftener to my library . It is in the chief approach to my house , so that under my eyes are my garden , my base-court , my yard , and even the best rooms of my house . There , without order or method , I can turn over and ransack now one book and now another . Sometimes I muse , sometimes save ; and walking up and down I indite and register these my humours , these my conceits . It is placed in a third storey of a tower . The lowermost is my chapel , the second a chamber , where I often lie when I would be alone . Above is a clothes-room . In this library , formerly the least useful room in all my house , I pass the greatest part of my life 's days , and most hours of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is a handsome , neat study , large enough to have a fire in winter , and very pleasantly windowed . If I feared not trouble more than cost I might easily join a convenient gallery of a hundred paces long and twelve broad on each side of this room , and upon the same floor , the walls being already of a convenient height . Each retired place requireth a walk . If I sit long my thoughts are prone to sleep . My mind goes not alone as if legs moved it . Those who study without books are all in the same case . My library is circular in shape , with no flat side save that in which stand my table and chair . Thus around me at one look it offers the full sight of all my books , set round about upon shelves , five ranks , one above another . It has three bay windows , of a far-extending , rich , and unobstructed prospect . The room is sixteen paces across . In winter I am less constantly there , for my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject to all weathers than this . But this pleases me only the more , both for the benefit of the exercise  --  which is a matter to be taken into account  --  and because , being remote and of troublesome access , it enables me the better to seclude myself from company that would encroach upon my time . There is my seat , that is my throne . My rule therein I endeavour to make absolute , that I may sequester that only corner from all , whether wife , children , or acquaintances . For elsewhere I have but a verbal and qualified authority , and miserable to my mind is he who in his own home has nowhere to be to himself . @# III .  --  Of Inequality Plutarch somewhere says that he finds no such great difference between beast and beast as between man and man . He speaks of the mind and internal qualities . I could find in my heart to say there is more difference between one man and another than between such a man and such a beast ; and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth and heaven . But concerning the estimation of men , it is marvellous that we ourselves are the only things not esteemed for their proper qualities . We commend a horse for his strength and speed , not for his trappings ; a greyhound for his swiftness , not his collar ; a hawk for her wing , not for her bells . Why do we not likewise esteem a man for that which is his own ? He has a goodly train of followers , a stately palace , so much rent coming in , so much credit among men . Alas , all that is about him , not in him . If you buy a horse you see him bare of saddle and cloths . When you judge of a man , why consider his wrappings only ? In a sword it is the quality of the blade , not the value of the scabbard , to which you give heed . A man should be judged by what he is himself , not by his appurtenances . Let him lay aside his riches and external honours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound body ? What mind has he ? Is it fair , capable , and unpolluted , and happily equipped in all its parts ? Is it a mind to be settled , equable , contented , and courageous in any circumstances ? Is he  --  A wise man , of himself commander high , Whom want , nor death , nor bands can terrify , Resolved t'affront desires , honours to scorn , All in himself , close , round , and neatly borne , Against whose front externals idly play , And even fortune makes a lame essay ? Such a man is five hundred degrees beyond kingdoms and principalities ; himself is a kingdom unto himself . Compare with him the vulgar troop  --  stupid , base , servile , warring , floating on the sea of passions , depending wholly on others . There is more difference than between heaven and earth , yet in a blindness of custom we take little or no account of it . Whereas , if we consider a cottage and a king , a noble and a workman , a rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although , as one might say , they differ in nothing but their clothes . An emperor , whose pomp so dazzles us in public , view him behind the curtain is but an ordinary man , and peradventure viler and sillier than the least of his subjects ! Cowardice , irresolution , ambition , spite , anger , envy , move and work in him as in another man . Fear , care , and suspicion haunt him even in the midst of his armed troops . Does the ague , the headache , or the gout spare him more than us ? When age seizes on his shoulders , can the tall yeoman of his guard rid him of it ? His bedstead encased with gold and pearls can not allay the pinching pangs of colic ! The flatterers of Alexander the Great assured him he was the son of Jupiter , but being hurt one day , and the blood gushing from the wound , " What think you of this ? " said he to them . " Is not this blood of a lively red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the ague or the gout what avail his titles of majesty ? But if he be a man of worth , royalty and glorious titles will add but little to good fortune . Truly , to see our princes all alone , sitting at their meat , though beleaguered with talkers , whisperers , and gazing beholders , I have often rather pitied than envied them . The honour we receive from those who fear and stand in awe of us is no true honour . " Service holds few , though many hold service . " Every man 's manners and his mind His fortune for him frame and find . @# IV .  --  Of the Use of Apparel I was devising in this chill-cold season whether the fashion of these late-discovered nations to go naked be a custom forced by the hot temperature of the air , as we say of the Indians and Moors , or whether it be an original manner of mankind . My opinion is , that even as all plants , trees , living creatures , are naturally furnished with protection against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who by artificial light quench the brightness of day , so we have spoilt our proper covering by what we have borrowed . Nations under the same heaven and climate as our own , or even colder , have no knowledge of clothes . Moreover , the tenderest parts of us are ever bare and naked  --  our eyes , face , mouth , nose , ears ; and our country swains , like their forefathers , go bare-breasted to their middles . Had we been born needing petticoats and breeches nature would have armed that which she has left to the battery of the seasons with some thicker skin or hide , as she has our finger ends and the soles of our feet . " How many men in Turkey go naked for devotion 's sake ? " a certain man demanded of one of our loitering rogues whom in the depth of winter he saw wandering up and down with nothing but his shirt about him , yet as blithe and lusty as another that keeps himself muffled up to the ears in furs . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " your fate all bare ? Imagine I am all face . " The Italians say that when the Duke of Florence asked his fool how , being so ill-clad , he could endure the cold , he replied , " Master , use but my receipt , and put all the clothes you have on you , as I do all mine , and you shall feel no more cold than I do . " King Massinissa , were it never so sharp weather , always went bareheaded . So did the Emperor Severus . In the battle of the Egyptians and Persians , Herodotus noticed that of those slain the Egyptians had skulls much harder than the Persians , by reason that these go ever with their heads covered with coifs and turbans , while those are from infancy shaven and bareheaded . King Agesilaus wore his clothes alike winter and summer . Suetonius says Caesar always marched at the head of his troops , and most commonly bareheaded and on foot , whether the sun shone or whether it rained . The like is reported of Hannibal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the body , earnestly persuades that no man should ever give feet or head other cover than nature had allotted them . We Frenchmen are accustomed to array ourselves strangely in parti-coloured suits ( not I , for I seldom wear any but black and white , like my father ) to protect ourselves against the cold , but what should we do in cold like that Captain Martyn du Bellay describes  --  frosts so hard that the wine had to be chopped up with axes and shared to the soldiers by weight ? @# V.  --  Of Solitariness Let us leave apart the outworn comparison between a solitary and an active life , and ask those who engage themselves " for the public good " whether what they seek in these public charges is not , after all , private commodity ? Public or private , as I suppose , the end is the same , to live better at ease . But a man does not always seek the best way to come at it , and often supposes himself to have quit cares when he has but changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government of a private family than in managing a state . Wheresoever the mind is buried , there lies all . And though domestic occupations may be less important , they are not less importunate . Moreover , though we have freed ourselves from court or from market , we have still the torments of ambition , avarice , irresolution , fear , and unsatisfied desires . These follow us even into cloisters and schools of philosophy . When Socrates was told that a certain man was none the better for his travels , " I believe it well , " said he , " for he took himself with him . " If a man do not first get rid of what burthens his mind , moving from place to place will not help him . It is not enough for a man to sequester himself from people ; he must seclude himself from himself . We carry our fetters with us . Our evil is rooted in our mind , and the mind can not escape from itself . Therefore must it be reduced and brought into itself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoyed even in the throng of peopled cities or kings ' courts . A man may , if he can , have wife , children , goods , health , but not so tie himself to them that his felicity depends on them . We should reserve for ourselves some place where we may , as it were , hoard up our true liberty . Virtue is contented with itself , without discipline , words , or deeds . Shake we off these violent holdfasts which engage us and estrange us from ourselves . The greatest thing is for a man to know how to be his own . I esteem not Arcesilaus , the philosopher , less reformed because I know him to have used household utensils of gold and silver , as the condition of his fortune permitted . And knowing what slender hold accessory comforts have , I omit not , in enjoying them , humbly to beseech God of His mercy to make me content with myself and the goods I have in myself . The wiser sort of men , having a strong and vigorous mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But mine being common , I must help to uphold myself by corporal comforts . And age having despoiled me of some of these , I sharpen my appetite for those remaining . Glory , which Pliny and Cicero propose to us , is far from my thoughts . " Glory and rest are things that can not squat on the same bench . " Stay your mind in assured and limited cogitations , wherein it best may please itself , and having gained knowledge of true felicities , enjoy them , and rest satisfied without wishing a further continuance either of life or of name . @# VI .  --  Opinion in Good and Evil Men , saith an ancient Greek , are tormented by the opinion they have of things , and not by things themselves . It were a great conquest of our miserable human condition if any man could establish everywhere this true proposition . For if evils lie only in our judgment , it is in our power to condemn them or to turn them to good . In death , what we principally fear is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for but what she casts upon us through hunger , thirst , cold , and other miseries . I will willingly grant that pain is the worst accident of our being ; I hate and shun it as much as possible . But it is in our power , if not to annul , at least to diminish it , with patience , and though the body should be moved , yet to keep mind and reason in good temper . If it were not so , what has brought virtue , valour , magnanimity , fortitude , into credit ? If a man is not to lie on the hard ground , to endure the heat of the scorching sun , to feed hungrily on a horse or an ass , to see himself mangled and cut in pieces , to have a bullet plucked out of his bones , to suffer incisions , his flesh to be stitched up , cauterised , and searched  --  all incident to a martial man  --  how shall we purchase the advantage and pre-eminence we so greedily seek over the vulgar sort ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if pain be violent it is also short ; if long , it is easier . Thou shall not feel it over-long ; if thou feel it over-much , it will either end itself or end thee . Even as an enemy becomes more furious when we fly from him , so does pain grow prouder if we tremble under it . It will stoop and yield on better terms to him who makes head against it . In recoiling we draw on the enemy . As the body is steadier and stronger to a charge if it stand stiffly , so is the soul . Weak-backed men , such as I am , feel a dash of a barber 's razor more than ten blows with a sword in the heat of fight . The painful throes of childbearing , deemed by physicians and the word of God to be very great , some nations make no account of . I omit to speak of the Lacedaemonian women ; come we to the Switzers of our infantry . Trudging and trotting after their husbands , to-day you see them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought into the world . How many examples have we not of contempt of pain and smart by that sex ! What can they not do , what will they not do , what fear they to do , so they may but hope for some amendment of their beauty ? To become slender in waist , and to have a straight spagnolised body , what pinching , what girding , what cingling will they not endure ! Yea , sometimes with iron plates , with whalebones , and other such trashy implements , that their very skin and quick flesh is eaten in and consumed to the bones , whereby they sometimes work their own death . There is a certain effeminate and light opinion , and that no more in sorrow than it is in pleasure , whereby we are so dainty tender that we can not abide to be stung of a bee , but must roar and cry out . This is the total sum of all , that you be master of yourself . @# @# PLATO The Apology , or Defence of Socrates Aristocles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgotten because the whole world knows him as Plato , was born at Athens about the year 427 B.C. As he grew up he became a devoted disciple of Socrates , and when the Athenian people had put the master to death , the disciple gave up his life to expounding the wisdom of his teacher . How much of that teaching was really implicitly contained in the doctrines of Socrates , it is difficult to say , since very definite developments evidently took place in Plato 's own views . Plato himself lived to the age of eighty , and died , as he had for the most part lived , at Athens , in 347 . When Socrates was indicted for " corrupting the youth " of Athens and on other corresponding charges , Plato was himself present at the trial . We may believe that the " Apology " is substantially a reproduction of the actual defence made by Socrates . The " judges " in the Athenian court were practically the assembled body of free Athenian citizens . When an adverse verdict was given , the accused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been named by the accuser , and the court could choose between the two penalties . Socrates was found guilty by a small majority of votes , and sentence of death was passed , as set forth in the last section of the " Apology . " @# I.  --  The Official Indictment , and the Real Charges What my accusers have said , Athenians , has been most specious , but none of it is true . The falsehood which most astonished me was that you must beware of being beguiled by my consummate eloquence ; for I am not eloquent at all , unless speaking pure truth be eloquence . You will hear me speak with adornments and without premeditation in my everyday language , which many of you have heard . I am seventy years old , yet this is my first appearance in the courts , and I have no experience of forensic arts . All I ask is that you will take heed whether what I say be just . It is just that I should begin by defending myself against my accusers from of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accusers . For , skilful as these are , I fear those more  --  those who from your youth have been untruthfully warning you against one Socrates , a wise man , who speculates about everything in heaven and under the earth , and tries to make the worse cause the better . Their charge is the craftier , because you think that a man who does as they say has no thought for the gods . I can not name these gentlemen precisely , beyond indicating that one is a writer of comedies ; I can not meet and refute them individually . However , I must try to enter a brief defence . I think I know where my difficulty will lie ; but the issue will be as the gods choose . Now , what is the basis of this charge , on which Meletus also relies ? " Socrates is an evil doer , a busybody , who pries into things in heaven and under the earth , and teaches these same things to others . " You all saw the Socrates in the comedy of Aristophanes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against such inquiries ; but do not let Meletus charge me with them , for I have no part nor lot in them . Many of you have heard me talk , but never one on these subjects . Witness you yourselves . From this you should be able to gauge the other things that are said against me . Equally untrue is the charge that I make a paid business of teaching my neighbours . It is a fine thing to be able to impart knowledge , like Gorgias , and Prodicus , and Hippias , who can go from city to city and draw to converse with them young men who pay for the privilege instead of enjoying their companions ' society for nothing . I am told there is one Evenus , a Parian , practising now , whose fee is five minas . It must be delightful to possess such valuable knowledge and to impart it  --  if they do possess it . I should like to do it myself , but I do not possess the knowledge . " Whence , then , comes the trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have been doing nothing unusual , how have these rumours and slanders arisen ? " I will tell you what I take to be the explanation . It is due to a certain wisdom with which I seem to be endowed  --  not superhuman at all like that of these gentlemen . I speak not arrogantly , but on the evidence of the Oracle of Delphi , who told Chaerephon , a man known to you , that there was no wiser man than Socrates . Now , I am not conscious of possessing wisdom ; but the God can not lie . What did he mean ? Well , I tried to find out , by going to a man reputed wise , thinking to prove that there were wiser men . But I found him not wise at all , though he fancied himself so . I sought to show him this , but he was only very much annoyed . I concluded that , after all , I was wiser than he in one particular , because I was under no delusion that I possessed knowledge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wise , one after the other , and made myself very unpopular , for the result was always the same . It was the same with the poets as with the politicians , and with the craftsmen as with the poets . The last did know something about their own particular art , and therefore imagined that they knew all about everything . I went on , taking every opportunity of finding out whether people reputed wise , and thinking themselves so , were wise in reality , and pointing out that they were not . And because of my exposing the ignorance of others , I have got this groundless reputation of having knowledge myself , and have been made the object of many other calumnies . And young gentlemen of position who have heard me follow my example , and annoy people by exposing their ignorance ; and this is all visited on me ; and I am called an ill-conditioned person who corrupts youth . To prove which my calumniators have to fall back on charging me with prying into all things in heaven and under the earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  The Cross-Examining of Meletus Such is my answer to the charges which have been poured into your ears for a long time . Now let me defend myself against these later accusations of Meletus and the rest  --  the virtuous patriot Meletus . I am an evil-doer , a corrupter of youth , who pays no reverence to the gods who the city reveres , but to strange daemons . Not I , but Meletus is the evil-doer , who rashly makes accusations so frivolous , pretending much concern for matters about which he has never troubled himself . Answer me , Meletus . You think it of the utmost importance that our youth should be made as excellent as possible . MELETUS : Certainly . SOCRATES : Tell us , then , who is it that makes them better ; for of course , you know . You are silent . The laws , you say ? The question was , " Who ? " MELETUS : The judges ; all the judges . SOCRATES : In other words , all the Athenian people  --  everyone but me ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an ill plight ! But in the case of all other animals , horses , for instance , there are only a few people who are able to improve them . Your answer shows that you have never bestowed attention on the care of young people . Next , tell me is it better for a man to dwell among good citizens or bad ? The good , since the bad will injure him . I can not , then , set about making bad citizens designedly . My friend , no man designedly brings injury upon himself . If I corrupt them , it must be undesignedly  --  reason good for admonishing and instructing me , which you have not done ; but not for bringing me into court , which you have done ! However , I corrupt them by teaching them not to believe in the gods in whom the city believes , but in strange deities ? Do I teach that there are some gods , or that there are no gods at all ? MELETUS : I say that you believe in no gods . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moon earth . SOCRATES : Most excellent Meletus , everyone knows that Anaxagoras says so ; you can buy that information for a drachma ! Do I really appear to you to revere no gods ? MELETUS : No , no gods at all . SOCRATES : Now , that is incredible ! You must have manufactured this riddle out of sheer wantonness , for in the indictment you charge me with reverencing gods ! Can anyone believe that there are human affairs , or equine affairs , or instrumental affairs without believing that there are men , or horses , or instruments ? You say expressly that I believe in daemonic affairs , therefore in daemons ; but daemons are a sort of gods or the offspring of gods . Therefore , you can not possibly believe that I do not believe in gods . Really , I have sufficiently answered the indictment . If I am condemned , it will not be on the indictment of Meletus , but on popular calumnies ; which have condemned good men before me , and assuredly I shall not be the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested that I ought to be ashamed of practices which have brought you in danger of death . Risk of death is not to be taken into account in any action which really matters at all . If it ought to be , the heroes before Troy were bad characters ! Every man should stand to his post , come life , come death . Should I have stood to my post and faced death when on service at Potidaca , but have failed through fear of death when the deity imposed on me a certain course of action ? Whether to die be evil or good , I know not , though many think they know it to be evil . But to disobey authority , human or divine , I know to be evil ; and I will not do what I know to be evil to avoid what may in fact be a good . Insomuch that if you now offer to set me free on condition that I should cease from these pursuits on pain of death , I should reply : " Men of Athens , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the god rather than you ; and while I breathe and have the power I will not cease from the pursuit of philosophy , or from exhorting and warning you as I have done hitherto , against caring much for riches and nothing for the perfecting of your souls . This is the bidding of the god . If to speak thus be to corrupt youth , then I corrupt youth . But he who says I speak other things than this talks vanity ; and this I will do , though the penalty were many deaths . " Do not murmur , but listen , for you will profit . If you put me to death , you will harm yourselves more than me , for it is worse to do wrong than to suffer it . You will not easily find another to serve as the gadfly which rouses a noble horse  --  as I have done , being commissioned thereto by the god . For that I have made no profit for myself from this course , my poverty proves . If it seems absurd that I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part in public affairs , that is because of the divine or daemonic influence of which I have spoken , named also in mockery by Meletus in the indictment . This is a voice which checks but never urges me on . Indeed , had I meddled with politics , I should have been dead long ago . That I will prove by facts . When you chose to condemn the ten generals , my phyle supplied the Prytanes , and I alone stood out against you . And in the time of the thirty , I was ordered with four others to bring Leon from Salamis to be executed , and I alone would not ; and it may be that my own life was saved only because that government was broken up . Judge , then , if my life would not have been shorter , had I taken part in public life . But I have never posed as an instructor or taken money for giving instruction . Anyone who chooses can question me and hear what I have to say . People take pleasure in my society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves wise but are not . This duty the god has laid on me by oracles and dreams and every mode of divine authority . If I am corrupting or have corrupted youth , why do none of them bear witness against me , or their fathers or brothers or other kinsmen ? Many I see around me who should do so if this charge were true ; yet all are ready to assist me . This , and the like , is what I have to say in my defence . Perhaps some of you , thinking how , in a like case with mine but less exigent , he has sought the compassion of the court with tears and pleadings of his children and kinsfolk , will be indignant that I do none of these things , though I have three boys of my own . That is not out of disrespect to you , but because I think it would be unbeseeming to me . Such displays , as though death were something altogether terrifying , are to me astonishing and degrading to our city in the sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as in some respects I am held to excel the generality . But apart from credit , I count that we ought to inform and convince our judges , not seek to sway them by entreaties ; that they may judge rightly according to the laws , and not by favor . For you are sworn . And how should I persuade you to break your oath , who am charged by Meletus with impiety . For by so doing , I should be persuading you to disbelief in the gods , and making that very charge against myself . To you and to the god I leave it , that I may be judged as shall be best for you and for me. @# IV .  --  After the Verdict Your condemnation does not grieve me for various reasons , one of which is that I fully expected it . What surprises me is the small majority by which it was carried . Evidently Meletus , if left to himself , would have failed to win the few votes needed to save him from the fine . Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to propose an alternative  --  presumably , the sentence I deserve . I have neglected all the ordinary pursuits and ambitions of men  --  which would have been no good either to me or to you  --  that I might benefit each man privately , by persuading him to give attention to himself first  --  how to attain his own best and wisest  --  and his mere affairs afterwards , and the city in like manner . The proper reward is that I should be maintained in the Prytaneum as a public benefactor . You may think this merely a piece of insolence , but it is not so . I am not conscious of having wronged any man . Time does not permit me to prove my case , and I will not admit guilt by owning that I deserve punishment by a fine . What have I to fear ? The penalty fixed by Meletus , as to which I do not know whether it is good or bad ? Shall I , to escape this , choose something which is certainly bad ? Imprisonment , to be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a prisoner till I pay it ?  --  which comes to the same thing , as I can not pay . Exile ? If my fellow-citizens can not put up with me , how can I expect strangers to do so ? The young men will come to listen to me . If I repulse them , they will drive me out ; and if I do not their elders will drive me out , and I shall live wandering from city to city . Why can not I go and hold my tongue , you may ask . That is the one thing which I can not do . That would be to disobey the god , and the life would not be worth living , though you do not believe me . I might undertake to pay a mina . However , as Plato and Crito and Apollodorus urge me to name thirty minae , for which they will be security , I propose thirty minae. * * * * * Your enemies will reproach you , Athenians , for having put to death that wise man Socrates . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait , for I am old . I speak to those of you who have condemned me . I am condemned , not for lack of argument , but because I have not chosen to plead after the methods that would have been pleasant and flattering to you , but degrading to me . There are things we may not do to escape death , for baseness is worse than death , and swifter . Death has overtaken me , who am old , but baseness my accusers , who are strong . Truth condemns them , as you have condemned me , and each of us abides sentence , And for you who have condemned me there will be a penalty swift and sure , and so I take my leave of you . But to you , my true judges , who voted for my acquittal , I would speak while yet we may . I have to tell you that my warning daemon has in no way withstood the course I have taken , and the reason , assuredly , is that I have done what is best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For death is either only to cease from sensations altogether as in a dreamless sleep , and that is no loss ; or else it is a passing to another place where all the dead are  --  the heroes , the poets , the wise men of old . How priceless were it to hold converse with them and question them ! And surely the judges there pass no death-sentences ! But be you hopeful with regard to death , for to the good man , neither in life nor in death is there anything that can harm him . And for me , I am confident that it is better to die than to live . Therefore the daemon did not check me , and I have no resentment against those who have caused my death . And now we go , I to death and you to life ; but which of us to the better state , God knoweth alone . @# @# The Republic The wonderful series of dialogues in which Socrates takes the leading part are at once the foundation and the crown of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Certain of Plato 's disciples would claim that his highest achievement is " The Timaeus " ; there are some who set their affections on " The Phaedo " ; but a general vote of all Platonists would probably give the first position to " The Republic , " and this is undoubtedly the work which has had the widest general influence . In " The Republic " itself Socrates is , professedly engaged in a disputation , of which the object is to discover what Justice means ; and this leads to the description of the building up of that ideal state or commonwealth from which the dialogue derives its title of " The Republic . " @# I.  --  How the Argument Arose I had gone with Glaucon to attend the celebration of the festival of Bendis  --  the Thracian Artemis  --  a picturesque affair , and we were just leaving , when Polemarchus insisted on carrying us off by main force to the house of his father , Cephalus . There we found a small company assembled . The old gentleman received us with hearty geniality ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , if you take age good-humouredly . Of course , he owned that being wealthy makes a difference , but not all the difference . The best of wealth is that you need not do things which anger the gods and entail punishment in the hereafter ; you need not lie , or be in debt to gods or men . And this consciousness of your own justice is a great consolation . " But , " said I , " what is justice ? Is it always to speak the truth , and always to let a man have his property ? There are circumstances  --   --  " " I must go , " said he . " Polemarchus shall do the arguing . " This set us discussing the nature of justice . Glaucon took up the cudgels , after a preliminary skirmish with Thrasymachus . Assuming justice to be desirable  --  is it so for itself and by itself , or only for its results ; or both ? The world at large puts it in the second category as an inconvenient necessity . To suffer injustice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the weak combine to prevent injustice from being done . But if anyone had the ring of Gyges , which made him invisible , so that he could go his own way without let or hindrance , he would get all the pleasures he could out of life without troubling about the justice of it . Again , imagine on the one hand your really consummate rogue who gets credit for all the virtues and is surrounded by all the material factors of happiness ; and , on the other hand , a man of utter rectitude , on whom circumstances combine to fix the stigma of iniquity . He will be rejected , scourged , crucified ; while the other is enjoying wealth , honour , everything , and can afford to make his peace with the gods into the bargain . Then Adeimantus took the field in support of his brother . " The poets , " he said , " hold forth about the rewards of virtue here and hereafter . But we see the unrighteous prospering mightily ; and the religious mendicants come to rich folks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keen-witted lad is bound to argue that it is only the appearance of justice that is needed for prosperity ; while the gods can be reconciled cheaply . This dwelling on the temporal rewards of justice is fatal . What we expect of you is to show us the inherent value of justice  --  justice itself , not the appearance of it . " " Well argued , " said I , " especially as you reject your own conclusion . I can but try , though the task be hard . But my weak sight may enable me to read large characters better than small . Justice is the virtue of the state as well as of the individual ; finding it in the state , the greater , may help us to find it in the individual , the less . " @# II .  --  The Socratic Utopia Society arises because different people are the better skilled to supply different wants , and the wants of each are supplied by mutual arrangement and division of labour . Wants multiply ; the community grows ; it exchanges its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ producers ; and when folk begin to hire servants you have a complete city or state living a life of simplicity . " A city of pigs , " said Glaucon , " with no refinements . " We will go on and develop every luxury of civilisation . But then our city and its neighbours will be wanting each other 's lands . We must have soldiers . Our best guardians will be a select band , those who are of the right temper and thoroughly trained ; fierce to foes but gentle to friends , like that true philosopher , the dog , to whom knowledge is the test . The known are friends , the unknown foes  --  knowledge begets gentleness . So our guardians must be trained to knowledge ; we must educate them . Music and gymnastic , our national intellectual and physical training , must be taught . Literature comes first , and really we teach things that are not true before we teach things that are true  --  fables before facts . But over these we must exercise a rigid censorship , excluding what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attribute harmful doings to the gods . God must be represented as He is  --  the author of good always , of evil never ; also as having in him no variableness , neither shadow of turning . God has no need of disguises . The lie in the soul  --  essential falsehood  --  is to Him abhorrent , and He has no need of such deceptions as may be innocent or even laudable for men . God must be shown always as utterly true . Similarly , we must not have stories which inspire dread of death ; no Achilles saying in the under-world that it were better to be a slave in the flesh than Lord of the Shades . And again , no heroes  --  and gods still less  --  giving way to frantic lamentations and uncontrolled emotions , even uncontrolled laughter . Truth must be inculcated ; medicinal untruths , so to speak , are the prerogative of our rulers alone , and must be permitted to no one else . Temperance , which means self-control and obedience to authority , is essential , and is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must exclude a long list of most unedifying passages on this score . As for pictures of the afflictions of the righteous and the prosperity of the unjust , we must wait , as we have not yet defined justice . We turn to the poetical forms in which the stories should be embodied . The possible forms are the simply descriptive , the imitative , and the mixture of the two : narrative drama , and narrative mixed with dialogue . Our guardians ought to eschew imitation altogether , or at least to imitate only the good and noble . The act of imitating an evil character is demoralising , just as no self-respecting person will imitate the lower animals , and so on . Imitation must be restricted within the narrowest practicable limits . But who are to be our actual rulers ? The best of the elders , whose firmness and consistency have stood the test of temptation . To them we transfer the title of guardians , calling the younger men auxiliaries . And we must try to induce everyone  --  guardians , soldiers , citizens  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were like the men in the Cadmus myth , fashioned in the ground , their common mother . " I do n't wonder at your blushing , " said Glaucon . That they are brothers and sisters , but of different metals  --  gold , silver , brass , iron ; not necessarily of the same metal as their parents in the flesh ; and must take rank according to the metal whereof they are made . No doubt it will take a generation or two to get them to believe it . And now our soldiers must pitch their camp for the defence of the city . Soldiering is their business , not money-making . They must live in common , supported efficiently by the state , having no private property . The gold and silver in their souls is of God . For them , though not for the other citizens , the earthly dross called gold is the accursed thing . Once let them possess it , and they will cease to be guardians , and become oppressors and tyrants . @# III .  --  Of Justice and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Find the other three cardinal virtues first , and then justice will be distinguishable . Wisdom is in the guardians ; if they be wise , the whole state will be wise . Courage we find in the soldiers ; courage is the true estimate of danger , and that has been ingrained in them by their education . Temperance , called mastery of self , is really the mastery of the better over the baser qualities ; as in our state the better class controls the inferior . Temperance would seem to lie in the harmonious inter-relation of the different classes . Obviously , the remaining virtue of the state is the constant performance of his own particular function in the state , and not his neighbour 's , by each member of the state . Let us see how that works out in the individual . Shall we not find that there are three several qualities in the individual , each of which must in like manner do its own business , the intellectual , the passionate or spirited , and the lustful ? They must be separate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contradictory things at the same time ; your lusts bid you do what your intelligence forbids ; and the emotional quality is distinct from both desire and reason , though in alliance with reason . Well , here you have wisdom and courage in the intellectual and spiritual parts , temperance in their mastery over desire ; and justice is the virtue of the soul as a whole ; of each part never failing to perform its own function and that alone . To ask , now , whether justice or injustice is the more profitable becomes ridiculous . Now we shall find that virtue is one , but that vice has several forms ; as there is but one form of perfect state  --  ours  --  whether it happens to be called a monarchy if there be but one guardian , or an aristocracy if there be more ; and , as it has four principal imperfect forms , so there are four main vices . Here Glaucon and Adeimantus refused to let me go on ; I had shirked a serious difficulty . What about women and children ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might mean anything . What kind of communism was I demanding ? Well , there are two different questions : What is desirable ? And , What is possible ? First , then , our defenders are our watch-dogs . Glaucon knows all about dogs ; we do n't differentiate in the case of males and females ; the latter hunt with the pack . If women are similarly to have the same employments as men , they must have the same education in music and gymnastic . We must not mind ribald comments . But should they share masculine employments ? Do they differ from men in such a way that they should not ? Women bear children , and men beget them ; but apart from that the differences are really only in degrees of capacity , not essential distinctions of quality ; even as men differ among themselves . The natures being the same , the education must be the same , and the same careers must be open . But a second and more alarming wave threatens us : Community of wives and children . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Men and women must be trained together and live together , but not in licentiousness . They must be mated with the utmost care for procreation , the best being paired at due seasons , nominally by lot , and for the occasion . The offspring of the selected will have a common nursery ; the mothers will not know which were their own children . Parentage will be permissible only between twenty-five and fifty-five , and between twenty and forty . The children begotten in the same batch of espousals will be brothers and sisters . The absence of " mine " and " thine " will ensure unity , because it abolishes the primary cause of discord ; common maintenance by the state removes all temptation either to meanness or cringing . Our guardians will be uncommonly happy . As to practicability : communism is suitable for war . The youngsters will be taken to watch any fighting ; cowards will be degraded ; valour will be honoured , and death on the field , with other supreme services to the state , will rank the hero among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our own kith and kin . But as to the possibility of all this  --  this third threatening wave is the most terrific of all . @# IV .  --  Of Philosophy in Rulers It will be possible then , and only then , when kings are philosophers or philosophers kings . " You will be mobbed and pelted for such a proposition . " Still , it is the fact . The philosopher desires all knowledge . You know that justice , beauty , good , and so on , are single , though their presentation is multiplex and variable . Curiosity about the multiplex particulars is not desire of knowledge , which is of the one constant idea  --  of that which is , as ignorance is of that which is not . What neither is nor is not , that which fluctuates and changes , is the subject matter of opinion , a state between knowledge and ignorance . Beauty is beauty always and everywhere ; the things that look beautiful may be ugly from another point of view . Experience of beautiful things , curiosity about them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philosopher is not to be confounded with the connoisseur , not knowledge with opinion . The philosopher is he who has in his mind the perfect pattern of justice , beauty , truth ; his is the knowledge of the eternal ; he contemplates all time and all existence ; no praises are too high for his character . " No doubt ; still , if that is so , why do professed philosophers always show themselves either fools or knaves in ordinary affairs ? " A ship 's crew which does not understand that the art of navigation demands a knowledge of the stars , will stigmatise a properly qualified pilot as a star-gazing idiot , and will prevent him from navigating . The world assumes that the philosopher 's abstractions are folly , and rejects his guidance . The philosopher is the best kind of man ; the corrupted philosopher is the worst ; and the corrupted influences brought to bear are irresistible to all but the very strongest natures . The professional teachers of philosophy live not by leading popular opinion , but by pandering to it ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the true philosopher withdraws himself from so gross a world . Small wonder that philosophy gets discredited ! Not in the soil of any existing state can philosophy grow naturally ; planted in a suitable state , her divinity will be apparent . I need no longer hesitate to say that we must make our guardians philosophers . The necessary combination of qualities is extremely rare . Our test must be thorough , for the soul must be trained up by the pursuit of all kinds of knowledge to the capacity for the pursuit of the highest  --  higher than justice and wisdom  --  the idea of the good . " But what is the good  --  pleasure , knowledge ? " No . To see and distinguish material things , the faculty of sight requires the medium of light , whose source is the sun . The good is to the intellectual faculty what the sun is to that of vision : it is the source and cause of truth , which is the light whereby we perceive ideas ; it is not truth nor the ideas , but above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ source of light and the cause of growth . Again , as the material things with which the eye is concerned are in two categories  --  the copies , reflections or shadows of things , and actual things  --  correspondingly the things perceived by the intellect are in a secondary region  --  as the mathematical  --  where everything is derived from hypotheses which are assumed to be first principles ; or in a supreme region , in which hypotheses are orly the steps by which we ascend to the real ultimate first principles themselves . And it will follow further that the mind has four faculties appropriate to these four divisions , which we call respectively pure reason ( the highest ) , understanding , conviction , and perception of shadows ; the first pair being concerned with being , the field of the intellect ; the second pair with becoming , the field of opinion . @# V.  --  Of Shadows and Realities Let me speak a parable . Humanity  --  ourselves  --  are as people dwelling ever bound and fettered in a twilit cave , with our backs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond the parapet a fire ; all that we see is the shadows thrown on the wall that faces us by figures passing along the parapet behind us ; all we hear is the echo of their voices . Now , if some of us are turned round to face the light and look on the real figures , they will be dazzled at first , and much more if they are taken out into the light , and up to face the sun himself ; but presently they will see perfectly , and have all the joy thereof . Now send them back into the cave , and they will be apparently much blinder than the folk who have been there all the time , and their talk of what they have seen will be taken for the babbling of fools , or worse . Small wonder that those who have beheld the light have but little mind to return to the twilight cave which is the common world . But remember  --  everyone in the cave possesses the faculty of sight if only his eyes be turned to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him with his back to the light , and every man may be converted and live . So we must select those who are most capable of facing the light , and see to it that they return to the cave , to give the cave-dwellers the benefit of their knowledge . And if this be for them a hardship , we must bear in mind as before , that the good of the whole is what matters , not whether one or another may suffer hardship for the sake of the whole . How , then , shall we train them to the passage from darkness to light ? For this , our education in music and gymnastic is wholly inadequate . We must proceed first to the science of numbers , then of geometry , then of astronomy . And after astronomy , there is the sister science of abstract harmonics  --  not of audible sounds . All of which are but the prelude to the ultimate supreme science of dialectic , which carries the intelligence to the contemplation of the idea of the good , the ultimate goal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is the science of the pure reason , the coping-stone of knowledge . We saw long ago that our rulers must possess every endowment of mind and body , all cultivated to the highest degree . From the select we must again select , at twenty , those who are most fit for the next ten years ' course of education ; and from them , at thirty , we shall choose those who can , with confidence , be taken to face the light ; who have been tested and found absolutely steadfast , not shaken by having got beyond the conventional view of things . We will give them five or six years of philosophy ; then fifteen years of responsible office in the state ; and at fifty they shall return to philosophy , subject to the call upon them to take up the duties of rulership and of educating their successors . @# VI .  --  Of State Types and Individual Types Before this digression we were on the point of discussing the four vitiated forms of the state , and the corresponding individual types @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Hellas , are : the Spartan , where personal ambition and honour rule , which we call timocracy ; the oligarchical , where wealth rules ; the democratic ; and the arbitrary rule of the individual , which we call tyranny . The comparison of this last  --  the supremely unjust  --  with our own  --  the supremely just  --  will show whether justice or injustice be the more desirable . The perfect state degenerates to timocracy when the state 's numerical law of generation an unsolved riddle has not been properly observed , and inferior offspring have entered in consequence into the ruling body . The introduction of private property will cause them to assume towards the commonalty the attitude , not of guardians , but of masters , and to be at odds among themselves ; also , in their education gymnastic will acquire predominance over music . Ambition and party spirit become the characteristic features . When , in an ill-ordered state a great man withdraws from the corruption of politics into private life , we see the corresponding individual type in the son of such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to win back for himself at all costs the prestige which his father had resigned ; personal ambition becomes his dominant characteristic . Oligarchy is the next outcome of the introduction of private property ; riches outweigh virtue , love of money the love of honour , and the rich procure for themselves the legal monopoly of political power . Here the state becomes divided against itself  --  there is one state of the rich and another of the poor  --  and the poor will be divided into the merely incompetent and the actively dangerous or predatory . And your corresponding individual is he whose father had won honours which had not saved him from ultimate ruin ; so that the son rejects ambition and makes money his goal , till , for the sake of money , he will compass any baseness , though still only under a cloak of respectability . In the oligarchy the avaricious encourage and foster extravagance in their neighbours . Men , ruined by money-lenders , turn on their moneyed rulers , overthrow them , and give everyone a share in the government . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor two , but diverse . Folk say what they like and do what they like , and anyone is a statesman who will wave the national flag . That is democracy . Such is the son of your miserly oligarch ; deprived of unnecessary pleasures , he is tempted to wild dissipation . He has no education to help him to distinguish , and the vices of dissipation assume the aspect and titles of virtue . He fluctuates from one point of view to another  --  is one thing to-day and another to-morrow . And last we come to tyranny and the tyrannical man . Democratic license develops into sheer anarchy . Jack is as good as his master . The predatory population becomes demagogues ; they squeeze the decent citizens , and drive them to adopt oligarchical methods ; then the friend of the people appears ; the protector , champion , and hero , by a familiar process becomes a military autocrat , who himself battens , as must also his mercenary soldiery , on the citizens ; and our unhappy Demos finds that it has jumped out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man was swayed by the devices and moods of the moment ; his son will be swayed by the most irrational and most bestial of his appetites ; be bully and tyrant , while slave of his own lusts . Your thorough blackguard of every species comes of this type , and the worst of all is he who achieves the tyranny of a state . See , then , how , even as the tyrannic state is the most utterly enslaved , so the tyrannic man is of all men the least free ; and , beyond all others , the tyrant of a state . He is like a slave-owner , who is at the mercy of his slaves  --  the passions which he must pamper , or die , yet can not satisfy . Surely such an one is the veriest slave  --  yea , the most wretched of men . It follows that he who is the most complete opposite of the tyrant is the happiest  --  the individual who corresponds to our state . Proclaim it , then , son of Ariston , that the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and is of all men the most miserable , whether gods and men recognise him or no. @# VII .  --  Of the Happiness of the Just Now for a second proof . Three kinds of pleasure correspond to the three elements of the soul  --  reason , spirit , desire . In each man one of the three is in the ascendant . One counts knowledge vain in comparison with the advantages of riches , another with those of honour ; to the philosopher only truth counts . But he is the only one of them who makes his choice from experience of all three kinds . And he , the only qualified judge , places the satisfaction of the spirit second , and of desire lowest . And yet a third proof : I fancy the only quite real pleasures are those of the philosopher . There is an intermediate state between pleasure and pain . To pass into this from pleasure is painful , and from pain is pleasurable . Now , the pleasures of the body are really nothing more than reliefs from pains of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the soul , being of the eternal order , are necessarily more real than those of the body , which are fleeting  --  in fact , mere shadows of pleasure . Much as I love and admire Homer , I think our regulations as to poetry were particularly sound ; but we must inquire further into the meaning of imitation . We saw before that all particular things are the presentations of some universal idea . There is one ultimate idea of bed , or chair , or table . What the joiner makes is a copy of that . All ideas are the creation of the master artificer , the demiurge ; of his creations all material things are copies . We can all create things in a way by catching reflections of them in a mirror . But these are only copies of particular things from one point of view , partial copies of copies of the idea . Such precisely are the creations of the painter , and in like manner of the poet . What they know and depict is not the realities , but mere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have left us something other than imitations of copies . Moreover , what they imitate is not the highest but the lower ; not the truth of reason , but emotions of all sorts , which it should be our business not to excite but to control and allay . So we continue to prohibit the poetry which is imitation , however supreme , and allow only hymns to the gods , and praises of great men . We must no more admit the allurements of poesy than the attractions of ambition or of riches . Greater far are the rewards of virtue than all we have yet shown ; for an immortal soul should heed nothing that is less than eternal . " What , is the soul then immortal ? Can you prove that ? " Yes , of a surety . In all things there is good and evil ; a thing perishes of its own corruption , not of the corruption of aught external to it . If disease or injury of the body can not corrupt the soul , a fortiori they can not slay it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not induced by injury to the body . If , then , the soul be not destroyed by sin , nothing else can destroy it , and it is immortal . The number of existing souls must then be constant ; none perish , none are added , for additional immortal souls would have to come out of what is mortal , which is absurd . Now , hitherto we have shown only that justice is in itself best for the soul , but now we see that its rewards , too , are unspeakably great . The gods , to whom the just are known , will reward them hereafter , if not here ; and even in this world they have the better lot in the long run . But of this nothing is comparable to their rewards in the hereafter , revealed to us in the mythos of Er , called the Armenian , whose body being slain in battle , his soul was said to have returned to it from the under-world  --  renewing its life  --  a messenger to men of what he had there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judged , enjoyed or suffered a tenfold retribution for all they had done of good or evil in this life , and some for a second term , or it might be for terms without end . Then for the most part they were given again , after the thousand years , a choice of another lot on the earth , being guided therein by their experience in their last life ; and so , having drunk of the waters of forgetfulness , came back to earth once more , unconscious of their past . Let us , then , believing that the soul is indeed immortal , hold fast to knowledge and justice , that it may be well with us both here and hereafter . @# @# ARTHUR SCHOPENHAUER The World as Will and Idea Arthur Schopenhauer , who was born at Dantzig , in Germany , Feb. 22 , 1788 , and died September 21 , 1860 , came of highly intellectual antecedents , his mother , Johanna Schopenhauer , being a noted German authoress . As an indefatigable student he migrated , according to the fashion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to sit at the feet of various professors , and thus he attended courses at Gottingen , Berlin , and Jena successively , finally graduating at Jena in 1813 . The winter of that year he spent at Weimar , revelling in the society of Goethe , and also enjoying intercourse with Maier , the profound Orientalist , who indoctrinated him with those views of Indian mysticism which greatly influenced his future philosophic disquisitions . After writing and publishing a few slight treatises Schopenhauer sent forth his great work , " The World as Will and Idea , " which has immortalized him . It appeared in 1819 . During subsequent years , when he resided in Frankfort , he wrote his volumes on " Will in Nature , " " The Freedom of the Will , " " The Basis of Morals , " and " Parerga and Paralipomena . " The keynote of Schopenhauer 's philosophy is that the sole essential reality in the universe is the will , and that all visible and tangible phenomena are merely subjective representations , or formal manifestations of that will which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stands among philosophers as the uncompromising antagonist of Hegel , Fichte , Schelling and all the champions of the theory of consciousness and absolute reason as the essential foundation of the faculty of thought . The defect of his system is its tendency to a sombre pessimism , but his literary style is magnificent and his power of reasoning is exceptional . The epitome here given has been prepared from the original German . @# I.  --  The World as Idea " The world is my idea , " is a truth valid for every living creature , though only man can consciously contemplate it . In doing so he attains philosophical wisdom . No truth is more absolutely certain than that all that exists for knowledge , and therefore this whole world , is only object in relation to subject , perception of a perceiver , in a word , idea . The world is idea . This truth is by no means new ; it lay by implication in the reflections of Descartes ; but Berkeley first distinctly enunciated it ; while Kant erred by ignoring it . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Indian Vedanta , as Sir William Jones points out . In one aspect the world is idea ; in the other aspect , the world is will . That which knows all things and is known by none is the subject ; and for this subject all exists . But the world as idea consists of two essential and inseparable halves . One half is the object , whose form consists of time and space , and through these of multiplicity ; but the other half is the subject , lying not in space and time , for it subsists whole and undivided in every reflecting being . Thus any single individual endowed with the faculty of perception of the object , constitutes the whole world of idea as completely as the millions in existence ; but let this single individual vanish , and the whole world as idea would disappear . Each of these halves possesses meaning and existence only in and through the other , appearing with and vanishing with it . Where the object begins the subject ends . One of Kant 's great merits is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objects  --  space , time , causality  --  lie a priori in our consciousness , for they may be discovered and fully known from a consideration of the subject , without any knowledge of the object . Ideas of perception are distinct from abstract ideas . The former comprehend the whole world of experience ; the latter are concepts , and are possessed by man alone amongst all creatures on earth ; and the capacity for these , distinguishing him from the lower animals , is called reason . Time and space can each be mentally presented separately from matter , but matter can not be thought of apart from time and space . The combination of time and space in connection with matter constitutes action , that is , causation . The law of causation arises from change , that is from the fact that at the same part of space there is now one thing and then another , and this succession must be the result of some law of causality , seeing that there must be a determined part of space and a determined part of space for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Much vain controversy has arisen concerning the reality of the external universe , owing to the fallacious notion that because perception arises through the knowledge of causality , the relation of subject and object is that of cause and effect . For this relation only subsists between objects , that is between the immediate object and objects known indirectly . The object always pre-supposes the subject , and so there can be between those two no relation of reason and consequent . Therefore the controversy between realistic dogmatism and doctrinal scepticism is foolish . The former seeks to separate object and idea as cause and effect , whereas these two are really one ; the latter supposes that in the idea we have only the effect , never the cause , and never know the real being , but merely its action . The correction of both these fallacies is the same , that object and idea are identical . One of the most pressing of questions is , how certainty is to be reached , how judgments are to be established , and wherein knowledge and science consist . Reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has received . Of Itself it possesses only the empty forms of its operation . Knowledge is the result of reason , so that we can not accurately say that the lower animals know anything , but only that they apprehend through the faculty of perception . The greatest value of knowledge is that it can be communicated and retained . This makes it inestimably important for practice . Rational or abstract knowledge is that knowledge which is peculiar to the reason as distinguished from the understanding . The use of reason is that it substitutes abstract concepts for ideas of perception , and adopts them as the guide of action . The many-sided view of life which man , as distinguished from the lower animals , possesses through reason , makes him stand to them as the captain , equipped with chart , compass and quadrant , and with a knowledge of navigation of the ocean , stands to the ignorant sailors under his command . Man lives two lives . Besides his life in the concrete is his life in the abstract . In the former he struggles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creatures . But in the abstract he quietly reflects on the plan of the universe as does a captain of a ship on the chart . He becomes in this abstract life of calm reasoning a deliberate observer of those elements which previously moved and agitated his emotions . Withdrawing into this serene contemplation he is like an actor who has played a part on the stage and then withdraws and as one of the audience quietly looks on at other actors energetically performing . The result of this double life is that human serenity which furnishes so vivid a contrast to the lack of reason in the brutes . Reason has won to a wonderful extent the mastery over the animal nature . The climacteric stage of the mere exercise of reason is displayed in Stoicism , an ethical system which aims primarily not at virtue but at happiness , although this theory inculcates that happiness can be attained only through " ataraxia " ( inward quietness or peace of mind ) , while this can only be gained by virtue . In other words , Zeno , the founder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above the reach of pain and misery . But this use of pure reason involves a painful paradox , seeing that for an ultimate way of escape Stoicism is constrained to prescribe suicide . When compared with the Stoic , how different appear the holy conquerors of the world in Christianity , that sublime form of life which presents to us a picture wherein we see blended perfect virtue and supreme suffering . @# II .  --  The World as Will We are compelled to further inquiry , because we can not be satisfied with knowing that we have ideas , and that these are associated with certain laws , the general expression of which is the principle of sufficient reason . We wish to know the significance of our ideas . We ask whether this world is nothing more than a mere idea , not worthy of our notice if it is to pass by us like an empty dream or an airy vision , or whether it is something more substantial . We can surely never arrive at the nature of things from without . No matter how assiduous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond images and names . We resemble a man going round a castle seeking vainly for an entrance and sometimes sketching the facades . And yet this is the method followed by all philosophers before me . The truth about man is that he is not a pure knowing subject , not a winged cherub without a material body , contemplating the world from without . For he is himself rooted in that world . That is to say , he finds himself in the world as an individual whose knowledge , which is the essential basis of the whole world as idea , is yet ever communicated through the medium of the body , whose sensations are the starting point of the understanding of that world . His body is for him an idea like every other idea , an object among objects . He only knows its actions as he knows the changes in all other objects , and but for one aid to his understanding of himself he would find this idea and object as strange and incomprehensible as all others . That aid is will , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solves the problem of his own existence , reveals to him the inner structure and significance of his being , his action , and his movements . The body is the immediate object of will ; it may be called the objectivity of will . Every true act of will is also instantly a visible act of the body , and every impression on the body is also at once an impression on the will . When it is opposed to the will it is called pain , and when consonant with the will it is called pleasure . The essential identity of body and will is shown by the fact that every violent movement of the will , that is to say , every emotion , directly agitates the body and interferes with its vital functions . So we may legitimately say , My body is the objectivity of my will . It is simply owing to this special relation to one body that the knowing subject is an individual . Our knowing , being bound to individuality , necessitates that each of us can only be one , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the need for philosophy . The double knowledge which each of us possesses of his own body is the key to the nature of every phenomenon in the world . Nothing is either known to us or thinkable by us except will and idea . If we examine the reality of the body and its actions , we discover nothing beyond the fact that it is an idea , except the will . With this double discovery reality is exhausted . We can ascribe no other kind of reality to the material world . If we maintain that it is something more than merely our idea , we must say that in its inmost nature it is that which we discover in ourselves as will . But the acts of will have always a ground or reason outside themselves in motives , which , however , never determine more than how we shall act at any given time or place under any given conditions or circumstances . The will must have some manifestation , and the body is that manifestation . By the movements of the body the will becomes visible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the objectification of the will . The perfect adaptation of the human and animal body to the human and animal will resembles , though it far exceeds , the correspondence between an instrument and its maker . @# III .  --  The World as Idea . Second Aspect We have looked at the world as idea , object for a subject , and next at the world as will . All students of Plato know that the different grades of objectification of will which are manifested in countless individuals , and exist as their unrealized types or as the eternal forms of things , are the Platonic Ideas . Thus these various grades are related to individual things as their eternal forms or prototypes . Thus the world in which we live is in its whole nature through and through will , and at the same time through and through idea . This idea always pre-supposes a form , object and subject . If we take away this form and ask what then remains , the answer must be that this can be nothing but will , which , properly speaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovers that he himself is this will , and that the world exists only for him does so in relation to his consciousness . Thus each human being is himself in a double aspect the whole world , the microcosm . And that which he realizes as his own real being exhausts the being of the whole world , the macrocosm . So , like man , the world is through and through will , and through and through idea . Plato would say that an animal has no true being , but merely an apparent being , a constant becoming . The only true being is the Idea which embodies itself in that animal . That is to say , the Idea of the animal alone has true being , and is the object of real knowledge . Kant , with his theory of " the thing-in-itself " as the only reality , would say that the animal is only a phenomenon in time , space , and causality , which are conditions of our perception , not the thing-in-itself . So the individual as we see it at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our knowing the thing-in-itself , for the knowledge of that is beyond our faculties , and would require another kind of knowledge than that which is possible for us through our understanding . Thus do these two greatest philosophers of the West differ . The thing-in-itself must , according to Kant , be free from all forms associated with knowing . On the contrary , the Platonic idea is necessarily object , something known and thus different from the thing-in-itself , which can not be apprehended . Yet Kant and Plato tend to agree , because the thing-in-itself is , after all , that which lays aside all the subordinate forms of phenomena , and has retained the first and most universal form , that of the idea in general , the form of being object for a subject . Plato attributes actual being only to the Ideas , and concedes only an illusive , dream-like existence to things in space and time , the real world for the individual . @# IV .  --  The World as Will . Second Aspect The last and most serious part of our consideration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Human nature tends to relate everything else to action . The world as idea is the perfect mirror of the will , in which it recognizes itself in graduating scales of distinctness and completeness . The highest degree of this consciousness is man , whose nature only completely expresses itself in the whole connected series of his actions . Will is the thing-in-itself , the essence of the world . Life is only the mirror of the will . Life accompanies the will as the shadow the body . If will exists , so will life . So long as we are actuated by the will to live , we need have no fear of ceasing to live , even in the presence of death . True , we see the individual born and passing away ; but the individual is merely phenomenal . Neither the will , nor the subject of cognition , is at all affected by birth or death . It is not the individual , but only the species , that Nature cares for . She provides for the species with boundless prodigality through the incalculable profusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ever ready to let the individual fall when it had served its end of perpetuating the species . Thus does Nature artlessly express the great truth that only the Ideas , not the individuals , have actual reality and are complete objectivity of the will . Man is Nature himself , but Nature is only the objectified will to live . So the man who has comprehended this point of view may well console himself when contemplating death for himself or his friends , by turning his eyes to the immortal life of Nature , which he himself is . And thus we see that birth and death both really belong to life and that they take part in that constant mutation of matter which is consistent with the permanence of the species , notwithstanding the transitoriness of the individual . @# V.  --  The Will as Related to Time Above all , we must not forget that the form of the phenomenon of the will , the form of life in reality , is really only the present , not the future nor the past . No man ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future . The present is the sole form of life in sure possession . The present exists always , together with its content , and both are fixed like the rainbow on the waterfall . Now all object is the will so far as it has become idea , and the subject is the necessary correlative of the object . But real objects are in the present only . So nothing but conceptions and fancies are included in the past , while the present is the essential form of the phenomenon of the will , and inseparable from it . The present alone is perpetual and immovable . The fountain and support of it is the will to live , or the thing-in-itself , which we are . Life is certain to the will , and the present is certain to life . Time is like a perpetually revolving globe . The hemisphere which is sinking is like the past , that which is rising is like the future , while the indivisible point at the top is like the actionless present . Or , time is like a running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breaks but which it can not remove with itself . Therefore we are not concerned to investigate the past antecedent to life , nor to speculate on the future subsequent to death . We should simply seek to know the present , that being the sole form in which the will manifests itself . Therefore , if we are satisfied with life as it is , we may confidently regard it as endless and banish the fear of death as illusive . Our spirit is of a totally indestructible nature , and its energy endures from eternity to eternity . It is like the sun , which seems to set only to our earthly eyes , but which , in reality , never sets , but shines on unceasingly . The problem of the freedom of the will is solved by the considerations which have been thus outlined . Since the will is not phenomenon , is not idea or object , but thing-in-itself , is not determined as a consequent through any reason , and knows no necessity , therefore it is free . But the person is never free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for this indisputable reason , that he is already the determined phenomenon of the free volition of this will , and is constrained to embody the direction of that volition in a multiplicity of actions . Repentance never results from a change of will , for this is impossible , but from a change of knowledge . The essential in what I have willed I must continue to will , for I am identical with this will which lies outside time and change . Therefore I can not repent of what I have willed , though I can repent of what I have done ; because , constrained by false notions , I was led to do what did not accord with my will . Repentance is simply the discovery of this fuller and more correct knowledge . @# @# SENECA On Benefits The more famous son of a famous rhetorician , the Roman philosopher L. Annaeus Seneca was born at Corduba ( Cordova ) , in Spain , about the beginning of the Christian era . While the date of his birth is a matter for conjecture , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victim of Nero 's jealousy and ingratitude in 65 A.D. , when the emperor seized upon a plot against himself as the pretext for sentencing Seneca to enforced suicide . In the vivid pages of the historian Tacitus , there are few more pathetic descriptions than that recounting the slow ebbing of the old philosopher 's life after his veins had been opened . Seneca had known many vicissitudes of fortune . He was banished from Rome in 41 A.D. , but , after his recall , rose to great power and affluence as tutor and adviser to Nero . His works , many of which are lost , include tragedies , letters , and treatises on philosophy . The high ethical standard maintained by Seneca favoured the legend that he was influenced by the Apostle Paul , and a spurious correspondence between them was long accepted as genuine . Of the moral works there is , for insight into human nature and for generosity of impulse , no better representative than that " On Benefits . " @# I.  --  Benefits are to be Bestowed , Not Lent Among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it comes , and do not pause to consider , I should say that scarcely anything is so detrimental as this , that we do not know either how to confer or how to receive a benefit . The consequence is that benefits are bad investments , and turn out bad debts ; and in the cases where there is no return , it is too late to complain , for they were lost when we conferred them . I should find it hard to say whether it is meaner for a receiver to repudiate a benefit , or for a giver to press for its repayment , inasmuch as a benefit is a sort of loan , whose return absolutely depends on the spontaneous action of the debtor . We find many men ungrateful ; yet we make more men so , because at one time we are insistent and harsh in our claims for return ; at another time we are fickle enough to regret our generosity . By such conduct we spoil the whole favour , not merely after giving , but at the very moment of giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not so much received as wrung out of his benefactor . Can anyone be grateful to a man who has contemptuously tossed him a favour , or flung it at him in vexation , or out of sheer weariness given simply to rid himself of trouble ? A benefit is felt to be a debt in the same spirit in which it is bestowed , and it ought not , therefore , to be bestowed recklessly , for a man thanks himself for what he obtains from an undiscerning giver . Let us bestow benefits , not lend them on interest . He who , in the act of giving , has thoughts about repayment , deserves to be deceived . Well , then , what if the benefit has turned out ill ? Why , children or wives often disappoint our expectations , but we bring children up , we marry all the same ; and so determined are we in the teeth of experience , that when baffled we fight better , when shipwrecked we take to sea again . How much more seemly it is to be persistent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he does not receive , he must have given in order to receive , and that justifies ingratitude . How many are there who are unworthy of the light of day , and nevertheless the sun rises . This is the property of a great and good mind , to seek not the fruit of good deeds but good deeds themselves , and to search for a good man even after having met with bad men . If there were no cheats , what nobility would there be in showing bounty to many ? As it is , goodness lies in giving benefits for which we are not sure of recompense , but of which the fruit is at once enjoyed by a noble mind . The book-keeping of benefits is simple : so much is expenditure ; if there is any return , that is clear gain ; if there is no return , that is not a loss . I gave it for the sake of giving . No one registers his benefits in a ledger , or , like an exacting usurer , presses to the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of such matters , unless reminded by someone returning a favour ; otherwise they assume the form of a debt . Do not hesitate , then ; persevere in your generous work . Assist one with your means , another with credit , another with your favour , or your advice , or a word in season . Is he ungrateful for one benefit ? After receiving a second , perhaps he will not be so . Has he forgotten two ? Perhaps the third kindness will bring back the recollection of those that slipped his mind . The subject we have to treat is that of benefits . We have to lay down an ordered account of what is the chief bond of human society : we have to prescribe a rule of life , such that inconsiderate open-handedness may not commend itself under the guise of kindness , but also that our caution , while it controls , may not strangle generosity , which ought to be neither defective nor excessive . People must be instructed to receive cheerfully and to repay cheerfully , setting before themselves the high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are obliged , and this both in act and in feeling . It is necessary to point out that the first point which we have to learn is what we owe for a kindness received . One says he owes the money which he got , another a consulship , another a province . These , however , are but the outward tokens of good services , not the services themselves . A benefit is to the hand something intangible ; it is a process in the mind . There is a world of difference between the material of a benefit and the benefit itself . Hence the reality of a benefit lies not in gold , nor silver , but in the good will of the giver . The things which we hold in our hands , which we look at , and on which our desire is set , are perishable ; misfortune or injustice may rob us of them ; but a kindness lasts even after the loss of what was given . What , then , is a benefit ? It is the doing of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , being inclined and spontaneously ready for that which it does . Consequently , it is not the thing done or the thing given that matters , it is the intention . The spirit animating the act is what exalts trivial things , throws lustre on mean things , while it can discredit great and highly valued ones . The benefit itself does not consist in what is paid or handed over , just as the worship of the gods lies not in the victims offered but in the dutiful and upright feelings of the worshippers . If benefits consisted in things , and not in the actual wish to benefit , then the more things we got , the greater would the benefit be . But this is incorrect , for sometimes the man who has given a little in a noble way obliges us more deeply ; the man , that is , who has forgotten his own poverty in his regard for mine . What comes from a willing hand is far more acceptable than what comes from a full hand . " It was a small favour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could do no more . " But it is a great thing which this other gave " ; yes , but he hesitated , delayed , grumbled in the giving , gave disdainfully , or he made a show of it and had no mind to please the person on whom he bestowed it . Why , such a man made a present to his own pride , not to me ! @# II .  --  On Kinds of Benefits and the Manner of Giving Let us give , in the first place , what is necessary ; secondly , what is useful ; next , what is pleasant , and one should add , what is likely to last . We must begin with what is necessary ; for a matter involving life appeals to the mind differently from mere adornment and equipment . A man may be a fastidious critic in the case of a thing which he can do without . But necessary things are those without which we can not live , or without which we ought not to live , or without which we do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to be rescued from the hands of the enemy , from a tyrant 's anger , and the other chequered perils that beset human life . Whichsoever of these we avert , we shall earn gratitude proportionate to the terrible magnitude of the danger . Next come things without which , it is true , we can live , yet only in such plight that death were better ; such things are freedom , chastity , and good conscience . After these we shall rank things dear to us from association , blood-ties , use , and custom ; such as children , wife , home , and all else round which affection has so entwined itself that it views severance from them as more serious than severance from life . There is the subsequent class of things useful , a wide and varied class , including money , not superabundant , but suited to a sensible mode of living ; and public office , with advancement for those who look high . Again , we ought to consider what gift will afford the greatest pleasure ; and particularly ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as weapons of the chase to a woman or an old man , or books to a block-head , or hunting nets to a person engrossed in literary pursuits . We shall be equally careful , on the other hand , while we wish to send what will please , not to insult friends in the matter of their individual failing ; not to send wines to a toper , for instance , or drugs to a valetudinarian . Further , if free choice in giving lies in our power , we shall beyond everything select lasting gifts , in order that the present may be as little perishable as possible ; for few are so grateful as to think of what they have received when they do not see it . Even the ungrateful have flashes of recollection when a gift is before their eyes . In a benefit there should be common sense . One should think of time , place , individuals ; on these factors turn the welcome or unwelcome quality of gifts . How much more acceptable it is if we give what one does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has abundance and to spare ! Or the thing of which he has been long in quest without finding it , rather than what he is likely to see everywhere ! A benefit bestowed upon all and sundry is acceptable to none . What you wish people to feel grateful for , do seldom . Let no one misconstrue this as an attempt to check generosity : by all means let her go any length she will ; but she must go steady , not gad about . So let every recipient have some special mark about his gifts which may lead him to trust that he has been admitted to particular favour . Let him say : " I got the same as that man , but my gift came unasked " ; or , " I got what that man did ; but I secured it within a short period , whereas he had earned it by long waiting " ; or , " There are others who have the same ; but it was not given with the same words , nor the same courtesy on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on bounty ; for no delight can come of random gifts . I object to generosity becoming extravagance . As to this question of how to give , I think I can point out the shortest way : let us give in the manner in which we should like to receive ; above all , let it be done willingly , promptly , without the least hesitation . The most welcome benefits are those which are at hand for the taking , which come to meet us , where the one delay lies in the recipient 's modesty . The best course is to forestall a man 's wishes ; next best , to follow them . He who has got after asking , has not secured the favour for nothing ; since nothing costs so much as that which is bought by prayers . " I beg you " is a painful phrase ; it is irksome , and has to be said with humble looks . Spare your friend , spare anyone you hope to make your friend , this necessity . However prompt , a benefactor gives too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that some benefits be given in public ( like military decorations ) , others in secret ( like those that succour weakness , want , or disgrace ) . Sometimes the very person helped must be deceived into taking our bounty without knowing its origin . One may insist , " I wish him to know " ; but on that principle will you refuse to save a man 's life in the dark ? Why should I not abstain from showing him that I have given him anything , when it is one of the cardinal rules never to reproach a man with what you have done for him , and not even to remind him of it ? For this is the law of benefits as between the two parties ; the one must at once forget what he has given , the other must never forget what he has received . @# III .  --  On the Receiving of Benefits Now , let us cross to the other side , to treat of the behaviour which becomes men in receiving benefits . " From who are we to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , " From those to whom we should have liked to give . " It is a severe torment to be indebted to anyone against , your will ; on the other hand , it is more delightful to have received a benefit from one whom you could love even after he has done you a wrong . The truth is that more care must be taken in the choice of a creditor for a benefit than for money ; for the latter must have back only as much as I received , but the former must have more paid to him . And even after repayment of the favour , we nevertheless remain bound to each other . Thus an unworthy person is not to be admitted into that most sacred bond of kindnesses bestowed whence friendship arises . " But , " it is pleaded , " I can not always say ' No . ' " Suppose the offer is from a cruel and hot-tempered despot , who will interpret your rejection of his bounty as an insult ? Well , when I say you ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these are factors which destroy choice . But after we have decided on acceptance , let us accept with cheerfulness , showing our gratification , and let it be evident to the giver , so that he may have some immediate return . There are some who like to receive benefits only in private , for they object to a witness and confidant . One may conclude that such persons have no good intentions . Other men speak most offensively of their greatest benefactors . There are some people whom it is safer to affront than to serve , since by their dislike they seek to give the impression of being under no obligation . One ought to accept without fastidious affectation , and without cringing humility ; for if a man shows small care at the time of bestowal , when every newly-conferred benefit should please , what will he do when the first glow of pleasure has cooled down ? @# IV .  --  Ingratitude We must now investigate the main cause of ingratitude . It is caused by excessive self-esteem , the fault inherent in mortality of partiality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is caused by greed ; or by jealousy . Let us begin with the first of these . Everybody is a favourable judge of his own interest ; hence it comes that he believes himself to have earned all he has received , and views a benefit as payment for services . Nor does greed allow anyone to be grateful , for a gift is never sufficient for its exorbitant expectations . Of all these hindrances to gratitude , the most violent and distressing vice is jealousy , which torments us with comparisons of this nature : " He bestowed this on me , but more upon him , and he gave it him earlier . " There is no kindness so complete that malignity can not pull it to pieces , and none so paltry that a friendly interpreter may not enlarge it . You shall never fail of an excuse for grumbling if you look at benefits on their wrong side . See how certain men  --  yes , even some who make a profession of their philosophy  --  pass unfair censures upon the gifts of heaven . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body , harts in swiftness , birds in lightness , bulls in vigour . But what has been denied to mankind could not have been given . Wherefore , whosoever thou art that undervaluest human fortune , bethink thee what blessings our Father has bestowed upon us , how many beasts more powerful than ourselves we have tamed to the yoke , how many swifter creatures we overtake , and how nothing mortal is placed beyond the reach of our weapons . Not to return gratitude for benefits is base in itself , and is held base in all men 's opinion . Therefore , even the ungrateful men complain of the ungrateful , and yet all the time this failing , which none commend , is firmly planted in all ; so perverse is human nature that we find some become our deadliest enemies , not merely after benefits received , but for those very favours . I can not deny but that this befalls some from a kink in their disposition ; yet more act so because the interposition of time has extinguished the remembrance . Ungrateful is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which has been done him ; ungrateful is he who pretends he has not received it ; ungrateful is he who makes no return ; but the most ungrateful of all is he who has forgotten . There is a question raised whether so hateful a vice ought to go unpunished . Now , with the exception of Macedonia , there is no country where an action at law is possible for ingratitude . And this is a strong argument that no such action should be granted . This most frequent crime is nowhere punished , although everywhere condemned . Many reasons occur to me whereby it must needs follow that this fault ought not to come under the purview of law . First of all , the best part of a benefit is lost if a lawsuit is allowable , as in the case of a definite loan . Again , whereas it is a most honourable thing to show gratitude , it ceases to be honourable if it be forced . By such coercion we should spoil two of the finest things in human life  --  a grateful man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shall the ungrateful man be left unchastised ? " My answer is : " What , then ? Shall the undutiful man be left unchastised  --  the malignant man , or the avaricious , or the man with no self-control , or the cruel ? Dost thou think that goes unpunished which is loathed ? Dost thou not call him unhappy who has lost his eyesight , or whose hearing has been impaired by disease ? And dost thou not call him miserable who has lost the sense of feeling benefits ? " @# V.  --  Divine Benefits to Man Who is there so wretched , so totally forlorn , who has been born under so hard a fate and to such travail as never to have felt the vastness of the Divine generosity ? Look even at those who complain of and live malcontent with their lot , and you will find they are not altogether without a portion in the celestial generosity ; and there is none on whom some drops have not fallen from that most gracious fountain . God not give benefits ! Whence , then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or keep or seize ? Whence comes the infinity of delights for eye , ear , and understanding ? Whence that abundance that even furnishes our luxury ? Think of all the trees in their rich variety , the many wholesome herbs , and such diversity of foods apportioned among the seasons that even the sluggard might find sustenance from the casual bounty of earth . Whence come living creatures of every kind , some bred on solid dry land , some in water , others speeding through the air , to the end that every part of nature may yield us some tribute ? Those rivers , too , that , with their pretty bends , environ the plains , or afford a passage for merchandise as they flow down their broad , navigable channel ? What of the springs of medicinal waters ? What of the bubbling forth of hot wells upon the very seashore ? And what of thee , O mighty Larian Lake ? And thee , Benacus , whom wild waves shake ?

He was taught by his father who was a teacher , and by his uncle , a clergyman . At the age of seventeen he became a civil engineer , but about eight years later abandoned the profession because he believed it to be overcrowded . In 1848 he was engaged on the " Economist , " and five years later he began to write for the quarterly reviews . Spencer 's little book on Education dates from 1861 , and has probably been more widely read than all his other works put together , having been translated into almost all civilised , and several primitive languages . It is generally recognised as having effected the greatest educational reform of the nineteenth century . It was certainly the most powerful of single agents in effecting the liberation of girlhood from its unnatural trammels . It placed the whole theory of education upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the natural course of its evolution as a living creature . Spencer struck a fatal blow at the morbid asceticism by proxy which adults used to practice upon their children , and so great has been the influence of his work for the amelioration of childhood that he is certainly to be counted with the philanthropic on this ground . The first chapter has no equal in literature in its splendidly sober praise of natural knowledge . The wide knowledge which Spencer 's writings display of physical science , and his constant endeavor to illustrate and support his system by connecting its position with scientific facts and laws have given his philosophy great currency among men of science  --  more so , indeed , than among philosophical experts . Spencer died December 8 , 1903. @# I.  --  What Knowledge is of Most Worth ? It has been truly remarked that in order of time decoration precedes dress , the idea of ornament predominates over that of use . It is curious that the like relations hold with the mind . Among mental , as among bodily acquisitions , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools as in our own , this is the case . Men dress their children 's minds as they do their bodies in the prevailing fashion ; and in the treatment of both mind and body , the decorative element has continued to predominate in an even greater degree among women than among men . The births , deaths , and marriages of kings , and other like historic trivialities are committed to memory , not because of any direct benefit that can possibly result from knowing them , but because society considers them parts of a good education  --  because the absence of such knowledge may bring the contempt of others . Not what knowledge is of the most real worth is the consideration ; but what will bring most applause , honour , respect  --  what will be the most imposing . As throughout life not what we are but what we shall be thought is the question , so in education the question is not the intrinsic value of knowledge so much as its extrinsic effect on others ; and this being our dominant idea , direct utility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his teeth and staining his nails . The comparative worths of different kinds of knowledge have been as yet scarcely even discussed . But before there can be a curriculum , we must determine , as Bacon would have said , the relative value of knowledges . To this end a measure of value is the first requisite , and here there can happily be no dispute . How to live ?  --  that is the essential question for us . To prepare us for complete living is the function which education is to discharge . We must therefore classify the leading kinds of activity which constitute human life . In order of importance they are ( 1 ) those which directly minister to self-preservation , ( 2 ) those which by securing the necessaries of life indirectly minister to self-preservation , ( 3 ) those which have for their end the rearing and discipline of offspring , ( 4 ) those which are involved in the maintenance of proper social and political relations , ( 5 ) those miscellaneous activities which fill up the leisure part of life , devoted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can easily be shown that these stand in something like their true order of subordination , and such should be the order of education . It must give attention to all of these ; greatest where the value is greatest ; less where the value is less ; least where the value is least . Happily that all-important part of education which goes to secure direct self-preservation is in great part already provided for . Too momentous to be left to our blundering , nature takes it into her own hands , but there must be no such thwarting of nature as that by which stupid school-mistresses commonly prevent the girls in their charge from the spontaneous physical activities they would indulge in ; and so render them comparatively incapable of taking care of themselves in circumstances of peril . But more is needed , and it is that we should learn the laws of life and of health . This depends upon science , yet that increasing acquaintance with the laws of phenomena which has through successive ages enabled us to subjugate nature to our needs , and in these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago kings could not purchase , is scarcely in any degree old to the appointed means of instructing our youth . The vital knowledge  --  that by which we have grown as a nation to what we are , and which underlies our whole existence  --  is a knowledge that has got itself taught in nooks and corners , while the ordained agencies for teaching have been mumbling little else than dead formulas . Hitherto we have made no preparation whatever for the third great division of human activities  --  the care of offspring , on which no word of instruction is ever given to those who will by and by be parents . Yet that parents should begin the difficult task of rearing children , without ever having given a thought to the principles , physical , moral , or intellectual , which ought to guide them , excites neither surprise at the actors nor pity for their victims . To tens of thousands that are killed , and hundreds of thousands that survive with feeble constitutions , add millions that grow up with constitutions not so strong as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the curse inflicted on their offspring by parents ignorant of the laws of life . Architecture , sculpture , painting , music , and poetry may truly be called the efflorescence of civilised life , but the production of a healthy civilised life must be the first condition . The vice of our educational system is that it neglects the plant for the sake of the flower . In anxiety for elegance it forgets substance , preparing not at all for the discharge of parental functions and for the duties of citizenship , by imparting a mass of facts most of which are irrelevant , and the rest without a key . But the accomplishment of all those things which constitute the efflorescence of civilisation should be wholly subordinate to that instruction and discipline on which civilisation rests . As they occupy the leisure part of life , so should they occupy the leisure part of education . Yet in this remaining sphere of activity , also , scientific knowledge is fundamental , and only when genius is married to science can the highest results be produced ; indeed , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself poetic . The current opinion that science and poetry are opposed is a delusion . On the contrary , science opens up realms of poetry where to the unscientific all is blank . Think you that the rounded rock marked with parallel scratches calls up as much poetry in an ignorant mind as in the mind of a geologist , who knows that over this rock a glacier slid a million years ago ? The truth is that those who have never entered upon scientific pursuits are blind to most of the poetry by which they are surrounded . Sad indeed is it to see how many men occupy themselves with trivialities , and are indifferent to the grandest phenomena  --  care not to understand the architecture of the heavens , but are deeply interested in some contemptible controversy about the intrigues of Mary Queen of Scots are learnedly critical over a Greek ode , and pass by without a glance that grand epic written by the finger of God upon the strata of the earth ! If we examine the value of science as discipline , its priority is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of judgment , or for moral discipline . Also , the discipline of science is superior to that of our ordinary education because of the religious culture that it gives . Doubtless , to the superstitions that pass under the name of religion , science is antagonistic ; but not to the essential religion which these superstitions merely hide ; doubtless , too , in much of the science that is current there is a pervading spirit of irreligion , but not in that true science which has passed beyond the superficial into the profound . Not science , but the neglect of science , is irreligious ; devotion to science is a tacit worship  --  a tacit recognition of worth in the things studied ; and by implication in their Cause . Only the genuine man of science can truly know how utterly beyond not only human knowledge , but human conception , is the Universal Power of which Nature and Life and Thought are manifestations. @# II .  --  Intellectual Education While " believe and ask no questions " was the maxim of the church , it was fitly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also believed that a child 's mind could be made to order , that its powers were to be imparted by the schoolmaster ; that it was a receptacle into which knowledge was to be put and there built up after the teacher 's idea . But now we are learning that there is a natural process of mental evolution which is not to be disturbed without injury ; that we may not force on the unfolding mind our artificial forms , but that psychology , like economics , discloses to us a law of supply and demand , to which , if we would not do harm , we must conform . The forcing system has been by many given up , and precocity is discouraged . People are beginning to see that the first requisite to success in life is to be a good animal . The once universal practice of learning by rote is daily falling into discredit . We are substituting principles for rules , as is exemplified in the abandonment of that intensely stupid custom , the teaching of grammar to children . But of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing desire to make the acquirement of knowledge pleasurable rather than painful  --  a desire based on the more or less distinct perception that at each age the intellectual action which a child likes is a healthy one for it ; and conversely . We are on the highway towards the doctrine long ago enunciated by Pestalozzi that alike in its order and its methods , education must conform to the natural process of mental evolution . Education should be a repetition of civilisation in little . Children should be told as little as possible and induced to discover as much as possible . The need for perpetual telling results from our stupidity , not from the child 's . We drag it away from the facts in which it is interested , and which it is actively assimilating of itself . We put before it facts far too complex for it to understand , and therefore distasteful to it . By denying the knowledge it craves , and cramming it with knowledge it can not digest , we produce a morbid state of its faculties ; and a consequent disgust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ induced helplessness , we make the helplessness a reason for our method . Education of some kind should begin from the cradle . Whoever has watched with any discernment the wide-eyed gaze of the infant at surrounding objects , knows very well that education does begin thus early , whether we intend it or not ; and that these fingerings and suckings of everything it can lay hold of , these open-mouthed listenings to every sound , are first steps in the series which ends in the discovery of unseen planets , the invention of calculating engines , the production of great paintings , or the composition of symphonies and operas . This activity of the faculties from the very first , being spontaneous and inevitable , the question is whether we shall supply in due variety the materials on which they may exercise themselves ; and to the question so put , none but an affirmative answer can be given . Here we must take the course which psychology dictates . What can be more manifest than the desire of children for intellectual sympathy ? Mark how the infant sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holds , that you may look at it . See when it makes a creak with its wet finger on the table , how it turns and looks at you ; does it again , and again looks at you ; thus saying as clearly as it can  --  " Hear this new sound . " Watch the elder children coming into the room exclaiming  --  " Mamma , see what a curious thing ; " " Mamma , look at this ; " " Mamma , look at that ; " a habit which they would continue did not the silly mamma tell them not to tease her . Does not the induction lie on the surface ? Is it not clear that we must conform our course to these intellectual instincts  --  that we must just systematise the natural process  --  that we must listen to all the child has to tell us about each object , and thence proceed ? To tell a child this , and to show it the other , is not to teach it how to observe , but to make it a mere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than strengthens its power of self-instruction . Object lessons should be arranged to extend to things far wider and continue to a period far later than now ; they should not be limited to the contents of the house , but should include those of the fields and hedges , the quarry and the seashore ; they should not cease with early childhood , but should be so kept up during youth as insensibly to merge into the investigation of the naturalist and the man of science . We are quite prepared to hear from many that all this is throwing away time and energy ; and that children would be much better occupied in writing their copies and learning their pence tables , and so fitting themselves for the business of life . We regret that such crude ideas of what constitutes education , and such a narrow conception of utility , should still be prevalent . But this gross utilitarianism which is content to come into the world and quit it again without knowing what kind of a world it is , or what it contains , may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and by be found that a knowledge of the laws of life is more important than any other knowledge whatever  --  that the laws of life underlie not only all bodily and mental processes , but by implication all the transactions of the house and the street , all commerce , all politics , all morals  --  and that therefore without a comprehension of them , neither personal nor social conduct can be rightly regulated . It will eventually be seen , too , that the laws of life are essentially the same throughout the whole organic creation . No one can compare the faces and manners of two boys  --  the one made happy by mastering interesting subjects , and the other made miserable by disgust with his studies , by consequent inability , by cold looks , by threats , by punishment  --  without seeing that the disposition of one is being benefited and that of the other injured . Whoever has marked the effects of success and failure upon the mind and the power of the mind over the body , will see that in the one case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other there is danger of permanent moroseness , of permanent timidity , and even of permanent constitutional depression . As suggesting a final reason for making education a process of self-instruction , and by consequence a process of pleasurable instruction , we may advert to the fact that , in proportion as it is made so , there is a probability that it will not cease when schooldays end . As long as the acquisition of knowledge is rendered habitually repugnant , so long will there be a prevailing tendency to discontinue it when free from the coercion of parents and masters . And when the acquisition of knowledge has been rendered habitually gratifying , then there will be as prevailing a tendency to continue , without superintendence , that self-culture previously carried on under superintendence. @# III .  --  Moral Education The greatest defect in our programmes of education is entirely overlooked . Though some care is taken to fit youths of both sexes for society and citizenship , no care whatever is taken to fit them for the position of parents . While it is seen that for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is needed , it appears to be thought that for the bringing up of children no preparation whatever is needed . While many years are spent by a boy in gaining knowledge of which the chief value is that it constitutes the " education of a gentleman , " and while many years are spent by a girl in those decorative acquirements which fit her for evening parties , not an hour is spent by either in preparation for a family . Is it that this responsibility is but a remote contingency ? On the contrary , it is sure to devolve on nine out of ten . Is it that the discharge of it is easy ? Certainly not : of all functions which the adult has to fulfil , this is the most difficult . Is it that each may be trusted by self-instruction to fit himself , or herself , for the office of parent ? No : not only is the need for such self-instruction unrecognised , but the complexity of the subject renders it the one of all others in which self-instruction is least likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving the art of education out of our curriculum . Whether as bearing on the happiness of parents themselves , or whether as affecting the characters and lives of their children and remote descendants , we must admit that a knowledge of the right method of juvenile culture , physical , intellectual and moral , is a knowledge of extreme importance . This topic should be the final one in the course of instruction passed through by each man and woman . As physical maturity is marked by the ability to produce offspring , so mental maturity is marked by the ability to train those offspring . The subject which involves all other subjects , and therefore the subject in which education should culminate , is the THEORY AND PRACTICE OF EDUCATION . Our system of moral control must again be based upon nature , who illustrates to us in the simplest way the true theory and practice of moral discipline . The natural reactions which follow the child 's wrong-doings are constant , direct , unhesitating , and not to be escaped . No threats ; but a silent rigorous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finger , pain follows ; if it does it again , there is again the same result ; and so on perpetually . In all its dealings with inorganic nature it finds this unswerving persistence , which listens to no excuse , and from which there is no appeal ; and very soon recognising this stern though beneficent discipline , it soon becomes extremely careful not to transgress . These general truths hold throughout adult life as well as throughout infantile life . If further proof be needed that the natural reaction is not only the most efficient penalty , but that no humanly devised penalty can replace it , we have such further proof in the notorious ill-success of our various penal systems . Out of the many methods of criminal discipline that have been proposed and legally enforced , none have answered the expectations of their advocates . Artificial punishments have failed to produce reformation ; and have in many cases increased the criminality . The only successful reformatories are those privately established ones which approximate their regime to the method of nature  --  which do little more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criminal 's liberty of action as much as is needful for the safety of society , and requiring him to maintain himself while living under this restraint . Thus we see , both that the discipline by which the young child is taught to regulate its movements is the discipline by which the great mass of adults are kept in order , and more or less improved ; and that the discipline humanly devised for the worst adults fails when it diverges from this divinely-ordained discipline , and begins to succeed on approximating to it . Not only is it unwise to set up a high standard of good conduct for children , but it is even unwise to use very urgent incitements to good conduct . Already most people recognise the detrimental results of intellectual precocity ; but there remains to be recognised the fact that moral precocity also has detrimental results . Be sparing of commands , but whenever you do command , command with decision and constancy . Remember that the aid of your discipline should be to produce a self-governing being ; not to produce a being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that to educate rightly is not a simple and easy thing , but a complex and extremely difficult thing ; the hardest task which devolves on adult life . You will have to carry on your own moral education at the same time that you are educating your children . The last stage in the mental development of each man and woman is to be reached only through a proper discharge of the parental duties ; and when this truth is recognised it will be seen how admirable is the arrangement through which human beings are led by their strongest affections to subject themselves to a discipline that they would else elude ; and we shall see that while in its injurious effects on both parents and child a bad system is twice cursed , a good system is twice blessed  --  it blesses him that trains and him that is trained . @# IV .  --  Physical Education The system of restriction in regard to food which many parents think so necessary is based upon inadequate observation , and erroneous reasoning . There is an over-legislation in the nursery as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most injurious forms of it is this limitation in the quantity of food . We contend that , as appetite is a good guide to all the lower creation  --  as it is a good guide to the infant  --  as it is a good guide to the invalid  --  as it is a good guide to the differently-placed races of man  --  and as it is a good guide for every adult who leads a healthful life , it may safely be inferred that it is a good guide to childhood . It would be strange indeed were it here alone untrustworthy . With clothing , as with food , the usual tendency is towards an improper scantiness . Here , too , asceticism creeps out . Yet it is not obedience to the sensations , but disobedience to them which is the habitual cause of bodily evils . It is not the eating when hungry , but the eating in the absence of hunger , which is bad ; it is not drinking when thirsty , but continuing to drink when thirst has ceased , that is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that active exercise which , as every child shows us , nature strongly prompts , but from a persistent disregard of nature 's promptings ; but the natural spontaneous exercise having been forbidden , and the bad consequences of no exercise having become conspicuous , there has been adopted a system of factitious exercise  --  gymnastics . That this is better than nothing we admit ; but that it is an adequate substitute for play we deny . The truth is that happiness is the most powerful of tonics . By accelerating the circulation of the blood , it facilitates the performance of every function ; and so tends alike to increase health where it exists , and to restore it when it has been lost . Hence the intrinsic superiority of play to gymnastics . The extreme interest felt by children in their games , and the riotous glee with which they carry on their rougher frolics , are of as much importance as the accompanying exertion ; and as not supplying these mental stimuli gymnastics must be radically defective , and can never serve in place of the exercises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sportive activities to which the instincts impel are essential to bodily welfare . Whoever forbids them , forbids the divinely-appointed means to physical development . We suffer at present from a very potent detrimental influence , which is excess of mental application , forgetting that nature is a strict accountant , and if you demand of her in one direction more than she is prepared to lay out , she balances the account by making a reduction elsewhere . We forget that it is not knowledge which is stored up as intellectual fat that is of value , but that which is turned into intellectual muscle . Worse still , our system is fatal to that vigour of physique needful to make intellectual training available in the struggle of life . Yet a good digestion , a bounding pulse , and high spirits are elements of happiness which no external advantages can outbalance . Perhaps nothing will so much hasten the time when body and mind will both be adequately cared for , as a diffusion of the belief that the preservation of health is a duty . Few seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Men 's habitual words and acts imply the idea that they are at liberty to treat their bodies as they please . Disorders entailed by disobedience to nature 's dictates , they regard simply as grievances ; not as the effects of a conduct more or less flagitious . Though the evil consequences inflicted on their dependents , and on future generations , are often as great as those caused by time , yet they do not think themselves in any degree criminal . It is true that , in the case of drunkenness , the viciousness of a bodily transgression is recognised ; but none appear to infer that , if this bodily transgression is vicious , so , too , is every bodily transgression . The fact is , that all breaches of the laws of health are physical sins . When this is generally seen , then , and perhaps not till then , will the physical training of the young receive the attention which it deserves . @# @# Principles of Biology In 1860 Spencer commenced a connected series of philosophical works , designed to unfold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sociology and morality . " Principles of Biology " was published in 1864 , and aims to set forth , the general truths of biology as illustrative of , and as interpreted by the laws of evolution . It was revised in 1899. @# Proximate Definition of Life To those who accept the general doctrine of evolution , it needs scarcely to be pointed out that classifications are subjective conceptions which have no absolute demarcations in nature corresponding to them . Consequently in attempting to define anything complex we can scarcely ever avoid including more than was intended , or leaving out something that should be taken in . Thus it happens that on seeking a definition of life there is great difficulty in finding one that is neither more nor less than sufficient . As the best mode of determining the general characteristics of vitality , let us compare its two most unlike kinds and see in what they agree . Choosing assimilation , then , for our example of bodily life , and reasoning for our example of the life known as intelligence , it is first to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Without change food can not be taken into the blood nor transformed into tissue : neither can conclusions be obtained from premises . This conspicuous manifestation of change forms the substratum of our idea of life in general . Comparison shows this change to differ from non-vital changes in being made up of successive changes . The food must undergo mastication , digestion , etc. , while an argument necessitates a long chain of states of consciousness , each implying a change of the preceding state . Vital change is further made up of many simultaneous changes . Assimilation and argument both include many actions going on together . Vital changes , both visceral and cerebral , also differ from other changes in their heterogeneity ; neither the simultaneous nor the serial acts of digestion or of ratiocination are at all alike . They are again distinguished by the combination subsisting among their constituent changes . The acts that make up digestion are mutually dependent ; as are those which compose a train of reasoning . Once more , they differ in being characterised by definiteness . Assimilation , respiration , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only mark off the vital from the non-vital , but also creatures of high vitality from those of low vitality . Hence our formula reads thus :  --  Life is the definite combination of heterogeneous changes , both simultaneous and successive . Not a definite combination , allowing that there may be others , but the definite combination . This , however , omits its most distinctive peculiarity. @# Correspondence Between Life and Its Circumstances We habitually distinguish between a live object and a dead one by observing whether a change in the surrounding conditions is or is not followed by some perceptible and appropriate change in the object . Adding this all-important characteristic , our conception of life becomes  --  the definite combination of heterogeneous changes , both simultaneous and successive , in correspondence with external coexistences and sequences . Some illustrations may serve to show the significance of this addition . Every act of locomotion implies the expenditure of certain internal mechanical forces , adapted in amounts and directions to balance or outbalance certain external ones . The recognition of an object is impossible without a harmony between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Escape from enemies supposes motions within the organism related in kind and rapidity to motions without it . Destruction of prey requires a particular combination of subjective actions , fitted in degree and succession to overcome a group of objective ones . The difference of this correspondence in inanimate and animate bodies may be expressed by symbols . Let A be a change in the environment ; and B some resulting change in an inorganic mass . Then A having produced B , the action ceases . But take a sufficiently organised living body , and let the change A impress on it some change C ; then , while the environment A is occasioning a , in the living body , C will be occasioning c : of which a and c will show a certain concord in time , place , or intensity . And while it is in the continuous production of such concords or correspondences that life consists , it is by the continuous production of them that life is maintained . As , in all cases , we may consider the external phenomena as simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in relation , the broadest and most complete definition of life will be :  --  the continuous adjustment of internal relations to external relations . It will be best , however , commonly to employ its more concrete equivalent  --  to consider the internal relations as " definite combinations of simultaneous and successive changes " ; the external relations as " coexistences and sequences , " and the connection between them as a " correspondence . " @# The Degree of Life Varies as the Degree of Correspondence It is now to be remarked that the life is high in proportion as this correspondence between internal and external relations is well-fulfilled . Each step upward must consist in adding to the previously adjusted relations which the organism exhibits some further relation , parallel to a further relation in the environment . And the greater correspondence thus established must , other things being equal , show itself both in greater complexity of life and greater length of life  --  a truth which will be duly realised on remembering the enormous mortality which prevails among lowly-organized creatures , and the gradual increase of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ascending to creatures of higher and higher development . Those relations in the environment to which relations in the organism must correspond increase in number and intensity as the life assumes a higher form . Perfect correspondence would be perfect life . @# Growth , or Increase of Bulk Perhaps the widest and most familiar induction of biology is that organisms grow . Under appropriate conditions increase of size takes place in inorganic aggregates as well as in organic aggregates . Crystals grow . Growth is indeed a concomitant of evolution . The several conditions by which the phenomena of organic growth are governed , conspiring and conflicting in endless ways and degrees , qualify more or less differently each others ' effects . Hence the following generalisations must be taken as true on the average , or other things equal :  --  First , that growth being an integration with the organism of such environing matters as are of like nature with the matters composing the organism , its growth is dependent on the available supply of such matters . Second , that the available supply of assimilable matters being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree of growth varies according to the surplus of nutrition over expenditure . Third , that in the same organism the surplus of nutrition over expenditure is a variable quantity ; and that growth is unlimited or has a definite limit according as the surplus does or does not progressively decrease ,  --  a proposition exemplified by the increasing growth of organisms that do not expend force , and by the definitely limited growth of organisms that expend much force . Fourth , that among organisms that are large expenders of force , the size ultimately attained is , other things equal , determined by the initial size . Fifth , that where the likeness of other circumstances permits a comparison , the possible degree of growth depends upon the degree of organisation : an inference testified to by the larger forms among the various divisions and subdivisions of organisms . @# Why Do Organisms Cease to Grow Why should not all organisms , when supplied with sufficient material , continue to grow as long as they live ? We have found that organisms are mostly built up of compounds which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the materials for organic growth and the sources of organic force , it follows , from the persistence of force , that growth is substantially equivalent to the absorbed nutriment minus the nutriment used up in action . This , however , does not account for the fact that in every domestic animal the increments of growth bear continually decreasing ratios to the mass , and finally come to an end . Nevertheless , it is demonstrable that the excess of absorbed over expended nutriment must decrease as the size increases . Since in similar bodies the areas vary as the squares of the dimensions and the masses vary as the cubes , it follows that , however great the excess of assimilation over waste may be during the early life of an active organism , there must be reached , if the organism lives long enough , a point at which the surplus assimilation is brought to nothing  --  a point at which expenditure balances nutrition , a state of moving equilibrium . Obviously , this antagonism between assimilation and expenditure must be a leading cause of the contrast in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditioned . @# Development , or Increase of Structure In each of the organic sub-kingdoms the change from an incoherent , indefinite homogeneity to a coherent definite heterogeneity is illustrated in a quadruple way . The originally-like units or cells become unlike , in various ways , and in ways more numerously marked as the development goes on . The several tissues which these several classes or cells form by aggregation , grow little by little distinct from each other ; and little by little become structurally complex . In the shoot as in the limb , the external form , originally very simple and having much in common with countless simple forms , organic and inorganic , gradually acquires an increasing complexity , and an increasing unlikeness to other forms , and meanwhile , the remaining parts of the organism , having been developed severally , assuming structures diverging from each other and from that of this particular shoot or limb , there has arisen a greater heterogeneity in the organism as a whole . The most remarkable induction of von Baer comes next in order . It is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of characters in common with all other organisms in their earliest stages ; that at each subsequent stage traits are acquired which successively distinguish the developing embryo from groups of embryos that it previously resembled  --  thus step by step diminishing the group of embryos which it still resembles ; and that thus the class of similar forms is finally narrowed to the species of which it is a member . For example , the human germ , primarily similar to all others , first differentiates from vegetal germs , then from invertebrate germs , and subsequently assumes the mammalian , placental unguiculate , and lastly the human characters . The development of an individual organism is at the same time a differentiation of its parts from each other and a differentiation of the consolidated whole from the environment ; and in the last as in the first respect there is a general analogy between the progression of an individual organism and the progression of the lowest orders of organisms to the highest orders . @# The Laws of Multiplication Every living aggregate being one of which the inner actions are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintenance of its moving equilibrium depends on its exposure to the right amounts of these actions . Its moving equilibrium may be overturned if one of these actions is either too great or too small in amount : either by excess or defect of some inorganic or organic agency in its environment . Our inquiry resolves itself into this :  --  in races that continue to exist what laws of numerical variation result from these variable conflicting forces ? The forces preservative of a race are two  --  ability in each member of the race to preserve itself , and ability to produce other members . These must vary inversely  --  one must decrease as the other increases . We have to ask in what way this adjustment comes about as a result of evolution . Including under individuation all those processes completing and maintaining individual life , and under genesis all those aiding the formation and perfecting of new individuals , the two are necessarily antagonistic . Every higher degree of individual evolution is followed by a lower degree of race multiplication , and vice versa . Progress in bulk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress in fertility involves retrogress in bulk , complexity , or activity . The same quantity of matter may be divided into many small wholes or few large wholes ; but number negatives largeness , and largeness negatives number . It is a general physiological truth that while the building-up of the individual is going on rapidly , the reproductive organs remain imperfectly developed and inactive ; and that the commencement of reproduction at once indicates a declining rate of growth and becomes a cause of arrest in growth . It has now to be noticed how complexity of organisation is hindered by reproductive activity and conversely . The hydra 's power to produce young ones from nearly all parts of its body is due to the comparative homogeneity of its body , while it is not improbable that the smallness of human fertility , compared with the fertility of large feline animals , is due to the greater complexity of the human organisation  --  more especially the organisation of the nervous system . Of the inverse variation between activity and genesis we have examples in the contrast between the fertility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large with the large and the small with the small , we see that creatures which continually go through the muscular exertion of sustaining themselves in the air and propelling themselves rapidly through it are less prolific than creatures of equal weights which go through the smaller exertion of moving about over solid surfaces . The extreme infertility of the bat is most striking when compared with the structurally similar but very prolific mouse ; a difference in the rate of multiplication which may fairly be ascribed to the difference in the rate of expenditure . @# Interpretation and Qualification Derived as the self-sustaining and waste-sustaining forces are from a common stock of force , it necessarily happens that , other things being equal , increase of the one involves decrease of the other . It may therefore be set down as a law that every higher degree of organic evolution has for its concomitant a lower degree of the peculiar organic dissolution which is seen in the production of new organisms . How is the ratio between individuation and genesis established in each case ? All specialties of the reproductive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Given a certain surplus available for race preservation , and it is clear that by indirect equilibration only can there be established that peculiar distribution of this surplus which is seen in each case . Here a qualification must be made . Recognising the truth that every increase of evolution which is appropriate to the circumstances of an organism brings an advantage somewhat in excess of its cost , the general law , more strictly stated , is that genesis decreases not quite so fast as individuation increases . The result of greater individuation  --  whether it takes the form of greater strength or higher speed , facilitates some habitual movement or utilises better the absorbed aliment  --  is a greater surplus of vital capital ; part of which goes to the aggrandisement of the individual and part to the formation of new individuals . Hence every type that is best adapted to its conditions has a rate of multiplication that insures a tendency to predominate . Survival of the fittest , acting alone , is ever replacing inferior species by superior species . But beyond the longer survival , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives , we see here another way in which the spread of the superior is insured . Though the more evolved organism is the less fertile absolutely , it is the more fertile relatively . @# Multiplication of the Human Race What causes increase or decrease of genesis in other creatures causes increase or decrease of genesis in man . It is true that , even more than hitherto , our reasonings are here beset with difficulties . So numerous are the inequalities in the conditions that but few unobjectionable comparisons can be made . The human races differ not only in their sizes and foods , and in the climates they inhabit , but also their expenditures in bodily and mental action are extremely unequal . The increase of fertility caused by nutrition that is greatly in excess of expenditure is to be detected by comparing populations of the same race or of allied races one of which obtains good and abundant sustenance much more easily than the other . On carrying out such comparisons it is seen that in the human race , as in all other races , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large excess after defraying the cost of carrying on parental life , is accompanied by a high rate of genesis . It is also apparent that relative increase of expenditure , leaving a diminished surplus , reduces fertility . That infertility is generally produced in women by mental labour carried to excess is shown in the fact that most of the flat-chested girls who survive their high-pressure education are incompetent to bear a well-developed infant and to supply it with the natural food for the natural period . It is a matter of common remark how frequently men of unusual mental activity leave no offspring . It is likely to be urged that since the civilised races are on the average larger than many of the uncivilised races , and since they are also somewhat more complex as well as more active , they ought , in accordance with the alleged general law , and other things being equal , to be less prolific . But other things are not equal ; and it is to the inequality of the other things that this apparent anomaly is attributable . One more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of men conspicuous for activity , bodily and mental , who were also noted , not for less generative power than usual , but for more . The cases are analogous to some before-named in which more abundant food simultaneously aggrandises the individual and adds to the production of new individuals  --  the differences between cases being that instead of a better external supply of material there is a better internal utilisation of materials . Some peculiarity of organic balance , some potency of the digestive juices , gives to the system a perpetual high tide of rich blood that serves at once to enhance the vital activities and to raise the power of propagation . The proportion between individuation and genesis remains the same : both are increased by the increase of the common stock of materials . @# Human Population in the Future Any further evolution in the most highly-evolved of terrestrial beings  --  man  --  must be of the same nature as evolution in general . It must be an advance towards completion of that continuous adjustment of internal to external relations which was shown to constitute life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction this further evolution , this more complete moving equilibrium , this better adjustment of inner to outer relations , this more perfect co-ordination of action is likely to take :  --  the conclusion is that it must take mainly the direction of a higher intellectual and emotional development . There is abundant scope for development in ascertaining the conditions of existence to which we must conform ; and in acquiring a greater power of self-regulation . What are those changes in the environment to which , by direct or indirect equilibration the human organism has been adjusting itself , is adjusting itself now , and will continue to adjust itself ? And how do they necessitate a higher evolution of the organism ? In all cases pressure of population is the original cause . Were it not for the competition this entails , so much thought and energy would not be spent on the business of life ; and growth of mental power would not take place . Difficulty in getting a living is alike the incentive to a higher education of children , and to a more intense and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men submit to this discipline ; and nothing but this discipline could produce a continued progression . Excess of fertility is then the cause of man 's further evolution . And the obvious corollary is that man 's further evolution itself necessitates a decline in his fertility . The further progress of civilisation will be accompanied by an enhanced cost of individuation : whether it be in greater growth of the organs which subserve self-maintenance , in their added complexity of structure , or in their higher activity , the abstraction of the required material , implies a diminished reserve of materials for race maintenance . This greater emotional and intellectual development does not necessarily mean a mentally laborious life  --  for , as the goal becomes organic , it will become spontaneous and pleasurable . The necessary antagonism of individuation and genesis not only fulfils the a priori law of maintenance of the race from the monad up to man , but insures final attainment of the highest form of this maintenance  --  a form in which the amount of life shall be the greatest possible and the births and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of population has been the proximate cause of progress . After having duly stocked the globe with inhabitants ; raised all its habitable parts into the highest state of culture ; brought all processes for the satisfaction of human wants to perfection ; developed the intellect into complete competency for its work , and the feelings into complete fitness for social life ; the pressure of population as it gradually finished its work , must gradually bring itself to an end . Changes , numerical , social , organic , must by their mutual influences work unceasingly towards a state of harmony  --  a state in which each of the factors is just equal to its work . And this highest conceivable result must be wrought out by the same universal process which the simplest inorganic action illustrates . @# @# Principles of Sociology " Principles of Sociology " was published in four parts from 1876 to 1880 . It forms part of a connected series . In " First Principles " inorganic evolution  --  that of the stars and of the solar system  --  was outlined ; organic evolution was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the present treatise , " Principles of Sociology , " we approach super-organic evolution , and are introduced to the science of society under its Comtist title " Sociology . " @# Super-organic evolution may be marked off from , organic by taking it to include all those processes and products which imply the co-ordinated action of many individuals . Commencing with the development of the family , sociology has next to describe and explain the rise and development of political organisation ; the evolution of the ecclesiastical structures and functions ; the control embodied in ceremonial observances ; and the relations between the regulative and operative divisions of every society . @# I.  --  Domestic That evolution decreases the sacrifice of individual life to the life of the species , we may see on glancing upwards from the microscopic protozoa , where the brief parental life disappears absolutely in the lives of the progeny , to the mammalia , where the greatest conciliation of the interests of the species , the parents and the young , is displayed . The highest constitution of the family is reached where there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those of its members , old and young , that the mortality between birth and the reproductive age falls to a minimum , while the lives of adults have their subordination to the rearing of children reduced to the smallest possible . The diminution of this subordination takes place in three ways : First , by elongation of that period which precedes reproduction ; second , by fewer offspring born , as well as by increase of the pleasure taken in the care of them ; and third , by lengthening of the life which follows cessation of reproduction . Let us bear in mind that the domestic relations which are ethically the highest , are also biologically and sociologically the highest . @# MARRIAGE The propriety of setting out with the foregoing purely natural-history view will be evident upon learning that among low savages the relations of the sexes are substantially like those common among inferior creatures . The effect of promiscuity , however , being to hinder social evolution , wherever it was accompanied by unions having some duration , the product of such unions were likely to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evolution takes place in several directions by increase of coherence and definiteness . From promiscuity we pass to that form of polyandry in which the unrelated husbands have but one wife ; thence to the form in which the husbands are related ; and finally to the form in which they are brothers only , as in the fraternal polyandry of the ancient Britons . It is almost needless to point out that , as in passing from promiscuity to polyandry the domestic relations become more coherent and definite , so do they in passing from the lower forms of polyandry to the higher . That polygyny is better than polyandry may be concluded from its effects . It conduces in a higher degree to social self-preservation than the inferioi types of marital relations by making possible more rapid replacement of men lost in war , and so increases the chance of social survival . By establishment of descent in the male line it conduces to political stability ; and , by making possible a developed form of ancestor-worship , it consolidates society . @# MONOGAMY Societies which from generation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requirements are the best physically , morally , and intellectually , must become the predominant societies , and must tend through the quiet process of industrial competition to replace other societies . Consequently , marital relations which favour this result in the highest degree must spread ; while the prevailing sentiments and ideas must become so moulded into harmony with them that other relations will be condemned as immoral . The monogamic form of the sexual relations is manifestly the ultimate form ; and any changes to be anticipated must be in the direction of completion and extension of it . @# II .  --  Political Organisation A society is formed only when , besides juxtaposition there is co-operation . Co-operation is made possible by society and makes society possible . It pre-supposes associative men ; and men remain associated only because of the benefits co-operation yields them . But there can not be concerted actions without agencies by which actions are adjusted in their times , amounts , and kinds ; and the actions can not be of different kinds without the co-operators undertaking different duties . That is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or involuntarily . @# AGGREGATION The political evolution manifested by increase of mass is political aggregation . One of the laws of evolution at large is that integration results when like units are subject to the same force or the like forces ; and from the first stages of political integration to the last this law is illustrated . Likeness in the units forming a social group being one conditioned to their integration , a further condition is their joint reaction against external action : co-operation in war is the chief cause of social integration . The temporary unions of savages for offence and defence show the initiatory steps . When many tribes unite against a common enemy , long continuance of their combined action makes them coherent under some common control . And so it is subsequently with still larger aggregates . @# DIFFERENTIATION The state of homogeneity in the social aggregate is an unstable one . The primary political differentiation originates from the primary family differentiation . Men and women very early respectively form the two political classes of rulers and ruled . The slave class acquires separateness only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the owners ; slaves begin to form a division of the body politic when their personal claims begin to be distinguished as limiting the claims of their masters . Where men have passed into the agricultural or settled state it becomes possible for one community to take possession bodily of another community , along with the territory it occupies . When this happens , there arise additional class divisions . The class differentiation of which militancy is the actual cause is furthered by the establishment of definite descent , especially male descent , and by the transmission of position and property to the eldest son of the eldest continually . Inequalities of position and wealth once initiated tend to increase and to establish physical differences ; and beyond these there are produced by the respective habits of life mental differences , emotional and intellectual , strengthening the general contrast of nature . When there come conquests which produce compound societies and doubly compound ones there result superpositions of ranks : while the ranks of the conquering society become respectively higher than those which have existed before , the ranks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which militancy originates and which for a long time increase in definiteness , are at later stages and under other conditions interfered with , traversed , and partially or wholly destroyed . While the higher political evolution of large social aggregates tends to break down the divisions of rank which grew up in the small component social aggregates , by substituting other divisions , these original divisions are still more broken down by growing industrialism . Generating a wealth that is not connected with rank , this initiates a compelling power ; and at the same time , by establishing the equal positions of citizens before the law in respect of trading transactions , it weakens those divisions which at the outset expressed inequality of position before the law . @# POLITICAL FORMS AND FORCES In its primitive form political power is the feeling of the community acting through an agency which it has either informally or formally established ; and this public feeling , while it is to some extent the feeling spontaneously formed by those concerned , it is to a much larger extent the accumulated and organised sentiment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruler 's function as regulator is mainly that of enforcing the inherited rules of conduct which embody ancestral sentiments and ideas . @# CHIEFS AND KINGS At the outset the principle of efficiency was the sole principle of organisation , but evidently supremacy which depends exclusively on personal attributes is but transitory . Only when the chief 's place is forthwith filled by one whose claim is admitted does there begin a differentiation which survives through successive generations . The custom of reckoning descent through females , it may be noted , is less favourable to the establishment of permanent political headship than is the system of kinship through males , which conduces to a more coherent family , to a greater culture of subordination and to a more probable union of inherited position and inherited capacity . In sundry semi-civilised societies distinguished by permanent political headships , inheritance through males has been established in the ruling house while inheritance through females survives in the society at large . Descent through males also fosters ancestor-worship , and the consequent reinforcing of natural authority by supernatural authority  --  a very powerful factor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does to special fear of the ghosts of powerful men , until , where many tribes have been welded together by a conqueror , his ghost acquires in tradition the pre-eminence of a god , produces two effects . In the first place his descendant is supposed to partake of his divine nature ; and in the second place , by propitiatory sacrifices to him is supposed to obtain his aid . From the evolution-standpoint we are enabled to discern the relative beneficence of institutions which , considered absolutely , are not beneficent ; and we are taught to approve as temporary that which as permanent we abhor . The evidence shows that subjection to despots has been largely instrumental in advancing civilised life . @# COMPOUND POLITICAL HEADS An examination of fact shows that where groups of the patriarchal type fall into regions permitting considerable growths of population , but having physical structures which impede the centralisation of power , compound political heads will arise and for a time sustain themselves through co-operation of the two factors , independence of local groups , and need for union in war . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an aggregate of urban settlements than a single city . Not only do conditions determine the various forms which compound heads assume , but conditions determine the various changes they undergo . They may be narrowed by militancy , or they may be widened by industrialism. @# CONSULTATIVE BODIES The council of war is the germ out of which the consultative body arises . Within the warrior class , which was of necessity the land-owning class , war produces increasing differences of wealth , as well as increasing differences of status ; so that military leaders come to be distinguished as large landowners and local rulers . Hence members of a consultative body become contrasted with the freemen at large  --  not only as leading warriors are contrasted with their followers , but still more as men of wealth and authority . If the king attains or acquires the reputation of supernatural descent or authority , and the law of hereditary succession is so settled as to exclude election , those who might otherwise have formed a consultative body having co-ordinate power become simply appointed advisers . But if the king @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the consultative body retains power ; and if the king continues to be elected it is liable to become an oligarchy . @# REPRESENTATIVE BODIES How is the governmental influence of the people acquired ? The primary purpose for which chief men and representatives are assembled is that of voting money . The revenues of rulers are derived at first wholly and afterwards partly from presents . This primary obligation to render money and service to the head of the State , often reluctantly complied with , is resisted when the exactions are great , and resistance causes conciliatory measures . From ability to prescribe conditions under which money will be voted grows the ability , and finally the right , to join in legislation . @# LAWS Law is mainly an embodiment of ancestral injunctions . The living ruler able to legislate only in respect of matters unprovided for , is bound by the transmitted command of the unknown and the known who have passed away . Hence the trait common to societies in early stages that the prescribed rules of conduct , of whatever kind , have a religious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there arise forms of activity and intercourse not provided for in the sacred code ; and in respect of these the ruler is free to make regulations . Thus there comes into existence a body of laws of known human origin , which has not the sacredness of the god-descended body of laws : human law differentiates from divine law . And in proportion as the principle of voluntary co-operation more and more characterises the social type , fulfilment of contracts and implied assertion of equality in men 's rights become the fundamental requirements , and the consensus of individual interests the chief source of law ; such authority as law otherwise derived continues to have being recognised as secondary , and insisted upon only because maintenance of law for its own sake indirectly furthers the general welfare . The theories at present current adapted to the existing compromise between militancy and industrialism are steps towards the ultimate theory in conformity with which law will have no other justification than that gained by it as maintainer of the conditions to complete life in the associated state . @# PROPERTY The desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed , a condition to survival . The consciousness that conflict and consequent injury may probably result from the endeavour to take that which is held by another tends to establish the custom of leaving each in possession of whatever he has obtained by labour . With the passage from a nomadic to a settled state , ownership of land by the community becomes qualified by individual ownership ; but only to the extent that those who clear and cultivate portions of the surface have undisturbed enjoyment of its produce . Habitually the public claim survives , qualified by various forms of private ownership mostly temporary ; but war undermines communal proprietorship of land , and partly or wholly substitutes for it either the unqualified proprietorship of an absolute conqueror , or proprietorship by a conqueror , qualified by the claims of vassals holding it under certain conditions , while their claims are in turn qualified by those of dependents attached to the soil . The individualisation of ownership extended and made more definite by trading transactions under contract , eventually affects the ownership of land . Bought and sold by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect to the personal property produced by labour , but there is reason to suspect that while possession of such things will grow more sacred , the inhabited area which can not be produced by labour will eventually be distinguished as something which may not be privately possessed . @# THE INDUSTRIAL TYPE OF SOCIETY The traits of the industrial type of society are so hidden by those of the still dominant militant type that its nature is nowhere more than very partially exemplified . The industrial type is distinguished from the militant type as being not both positively regulated and negatively regulated , but as being negatively regulated only . To the member of the industrial community authority says " Thou shalt not , " and not " Thou shalt . " On turning to the civilised to observe the form of individual character which accompanies the industrial form of society , we encounter the difficulty that the personal traits proper to industrialism are , like the social traits , mingled with those proper to militancy . Nevertheless , on contrasting the characters of our ancestors during more warlike periods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an increasing ratio of industrialism to militancy , have come a growing independence , a less marked loyalty , a smaller faith in governments , and a more qualified patriotism ; and while there has been shown a strengthening assertion of individuality there has accompanied it a growing respect for the individualities of others , as is implied by the diminution of aggressions upon them , and the multiplication of efforts for their welfare . It seems needful to explain that it is not so much that a social life passed in peaceful occupations is positively moralising , as that a social life passed in war is positively demoralising . The sacrifice of others to self is in the one incidental only ; while in the other it is necessary . @# POLITICAL PROSPECT It appears to be an unavoidable inference that the ultimate executive agency must become in some way or other elective . From such evidence as existing society will afford us , it is to be inferred that the highest State-office in whatever way filled will continue to decline in importance . No speculations concerning ultimate political forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There will probably be considerable variety in the special forms of the political institutions of industrial society ; all of them bearing traces of past institutions which have been brought into congruity with the representative principle . To turn to political functions , when corporate action is no longer needed for preserving a society as a whole from destruction or injury by other societies , the end which remains for it is that of preserving the component members of society from injury by one another . With this limitation of the state function it is probable that there will be simultaneously carried further that trait which already characterises the most industrially-organised society  --  the performance of increasingly-numerous and increasingly-important functions by other organisations than those which form departments of the government . Already private enterprise , working through incorporated bodies of citizens , achieves ends undreamed of as so achievable in primitive societies ; and in the future other ends undreamed of now as so achievable will be achieved . The conclusion of profoundest moment to which lines of argument converge is that the possibility of a high social state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cessation of war . Persistent militancy , maintaining adapted institutions , must inevitably prevent , or else neutralise , changes in the direction of more equitable institutions and laws ; while permanent peace will of necessity be followed by social ameliorations of every kind . @# III .  --  Ecclesiastical Institutions Rightly to trace the evolution of ecclesiastical institutions , we must know whence came the ideas and sentiments implied by them . Are these innate or are they derived ? They are derived . And here it may be remarked that where among African savages there existed no belief in a double which goes away during sleep , there was found to exist no belief in a double which survived after death . From the ordinary absence of the other self in sleep , and its extraordinary absences in swoons , apoplexy , and so forth , the transition is to its unlimited absence at death ; when after an interval of waiting the expectation of immediate return is given up . Commonly the spirit is supposed to linger near the body or to revisit it . Hence the universality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at funerals . The habitat of the other self is variously conceived ; though everywhere there is an approach to parallelism between the life here and the imagined life hereafter . Along with the development of grave-heaps into altars , grave-sheds into religious edifices , and food for the ghost into sacrifices , there goes on the development of praise and prayer . Turning to certain more indirect results of the ghost theory , we find that , distinguishing but confusedly between semblance and reality , the savage thinks that the representation of a thing partakes of the properties of a thing . Hence the effigy of a dead man becomes a habitation for his ghost ; and idols , because of the indwelling doubles of the dead , are propitiated . Identification of the doubles of the dead with animals  --  now with those which frequent houses or places which the doubles are supposed to haunt and now with those which are like certain of the dead in their malicious or benevolent natures  --  is in other cases traceable to misinterpretation of names ; this latter leading to the identification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worship . In their normal forms , as in their abnormal forms , all gods arise by apotheosis . Originally the god is the superior living man whose power is conceived as superhuman . As in primitive thought divinity is synonymous with superiority , and as at first a god may be either a powerful living person or a dead person who has acquired supernatural power as a ghost , there come two origins for semi-divine beings  --  the one by unions between a conquering god race and the conquered race distinguished as men , and the other by supposed intercourse between living persons and spirits . Where the evidence is examined comparative sociology discloses a common origin for each leading element of religious belief . @# MEDICINE MEN AND PRIESTS In the primitive belief that the doubles of the dead may be induced to yield benefits or desist from inflicting evil by bribing or cajoling or else by threatening or coercing , we see that the modes of dealing with ghosts broadly contrasted as antagonistic and sympathetic , initiate the distinction between medicine man and priest . Prompted as offerings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it naturally happens that such propitiations are made more by relatives than others . The family cult next acquires a more definite form by the devolution of its functions on one member of the family . Hence in ancient Egypt " it was most important that a man should have a son established in his seat after him who should perform the due rites " of sacrifice to his ka or double . Facts also show that the devolution of the sacrificial office accompanies devolution of property , for this has to bear the costs of the sacrifices ; and by a natural corollary the head of the village-community combines the characters of priest and ruler . With the increase of a chief 's territory there comes an accumulation of business which necessitates the employment of assistants , and among the functions deputed is that of priest , at first perhaps temporarily assumed by a brother . Such is the usual origin of priesthood . Many facts make it clear that , not only the genesis of polytheism but the long survival of it are sequences of primitive ancestor-worship . Eventually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with this an advance towards unification of priesthood . The official proprietors of the deity who has come to be regarded as the most powerful or as the possessor of all power becomes established everywhere . Likeness between ecclesiastical and political organisations when they have diverged is largely due to their community of origin . There results a hierarchy of sacerdotal functionaries analogous to the graduated system of political functionaries ; then the agencies for carrying on celestial rule and terrestrial rule eventually begin to compete for supremacy ; and there are reasons for thinking that the change from an original predominance of a spiritual power over the temporal power to ultimate subjugation of it is mainly due to the development of industrialism with the moral and intellectual changes involved . @# PROSPECT What may we infer will be the evolution of religious ideas and sentiments throughout the future ? The development of those higher sentiments which no longer tolerate the ascription of inferior sentiments to a divinity , and the intellectual development which causes dissatisfaction with the crude interpretations previously accepted , must force men hereafter to drop the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have long since dropped the lower . Those , however , who think that science is dissipating religious beliefs and sentiments seem unaware that whatever of mystery is taken from the old interpretation is added to the new . Or rather we may say that transference from one to the other is accompanied by increase ; since for an explanation which has a seeming feasibility , science substitutes an explanation which , carrying us back only a certain distance , then leaves us in the presence of the avowedly inexplicable . The truth must grow ever clearer  --  the truth that there is an inscrutable existence everywhere manifested to which the man of science can neither find nor conceive either beginning or end . Amid the mysteries which become the more mysterious the more they are thought about , there will remain the one absolute certainty , that he is ever in the presence of AN INFINITE AND ETERNAL ENERGY , from which all things proceed . @# @# BENEDICT DE SPINOZA Ethics Baruch ( Lat . Benedict ) Spinoza , or de Spinoza , as he afterwards signed himself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amsterdam , November 24 , 1632 , and died at the early age of forty-four , on February 21 , 1677 . He was educated to the highest pitch of attainment in Hebrew and Talmudist learning , and through delicacy of physical constitution devoted himself entirely to study , cultivating assiduously philosophy as well as theology , while not neglecting the physical sciences . Imbibing unorthodox views he was formally excommunicated from the synagogue , and philosophy henceforth became the sole pursuit of his mind . He was able , however , through his great scientific accomplishments and mechanical skill , to gain a sufficiency for his subsistence by polishing lenses . This accomplished man was also no mean artist , especially in designing . He was one of the finest Latinists of his time . He was filled with the spirit of religion , and lived the simplest life , on a few pence a day , in a period of voluptuous epicureanism .

" @# I.  --  Concerning God By God I understand absolutely infinite Being , that is , substance consisting of infinite attributes , each expressing eternal and definite essence . If this be denied , conceive , if it be possible , that God does not exist . Then it follows that His essence does not involve existence , which is absurd . Therefore God necessarily exists . God is absolutely the first cause . He acts from the laws of His own nature only , and is compelled by no one . For outside of Himself there can be nothing by which He may be determined to act . Therefore He acts solely from the laws of His own nature . And therefore also God alone is a free cause . The omnipotence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actual from eternity . The Divine intellect is the cause of things , both of their essence and of their existence . Thus it is the cause both of the essence and of the existence of the human intellect , but it differs from our intellect both in essence and in existence . The same may be said of the Divine will and the human will . The will can not be called a free cause , but can only be termed necessary . The will is only a certain mode of thought , like the intellect . It requires a cause to determine it to action , and therefore can not be called a free cause , but only a necessary cause . Hence it follows that God does not act from freedom of the will . For the will , like all other things , needs a cause to determine it to act in a certain manner . Things could have been produced by God in no other manner or order than that in which they have been . Things have been created by God in absolute perfection , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . @# The Divine Power and Decree Since in eternity there is no when , nor before , nor after , God can not decree nor could He have ever decreed anything other than He has decreed in the perfection of His nature . For if He had decreed something else about creation , He would necessarily have had an intellect and a will different from those He now has . Could such a supposition be allowed , why can not He now change His decree about creation yet remain perfect ? All things depend on the Divine power ; but God 's will , because of his perfection , can not be other than it is , and therefore things can not be differently constituted . For to suppose otherwise is to subject God to fate , an absurdity which is not worth waste of time to refute . The sum of the matter is that God necessarily exists ; that He is one God ; that He acts from the necessity of His nature ; that He is the free cause of all things ; that all things depend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Him . @# II .  --  Concerning Mind I pass on to those things which must necessarily follow from the essence of the eternal and infinite God . Thought is the attribute of God . Individual thoughts are modes expressing the nature of God in a certain and determinate manner . The order and connection of these ideas coincides with the order and connection of things , therefore God 's power of thinking is equal to His power of acting . The circle existing in nature and the idea of an existing circle which is also in God , are one and the same thing , exhibited through different attributes . God is truly the cause of things as they are in themselves , in so far as He consists of infinite attributes . The first thing which forms the actual Being of the human mind is nothing else than the idea of an individual actually existing . The essence of man is formed by certain modes of the Divine attributes , that is to say , modes of thought . The idea is the first thing which forms the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea of an individual thing actually existing . Hence the human mind is part of the infinite intellect of God . The knowledge of everything which happens necessarily exists in God , in so far as He forms the nature of the human mind . Man thinks . Modes of thought , such as love , desire , or affections of the mind under whatever designation , do not exist , unless in the same individual exists an idea of a thing loved , desired , etc . But the idea may exist though no other mode of thinking exists . Therefore the essence of man does not necessarily involve existence . We perceive that a body is affected in certain ways . No individual things are felt or perceived by us except bodies and modes of thought . The object of the idea constituting the human mind is a body , or a certain mode of actually existing extension , and nothing else . For if the body were not the object of the human mind , the ideas of the affections of the body would not be in God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but would be in Him in so far as He has formed the mind of another thing . But we have ideas of the affections of the body ; therefore the object of the idea constituting the human mind is the body actually existing . It follows that man consists of mind and body , and that the human body exists as we perceive it . @# Mind and Body Hence we perceive not only that the human mind is united to the body , but also what is to be understood by the union of mind and body . But no one can adequately comprehend it without previously possessing adequate knowledge of the body . In proportion as one body is better adapted than another to act or suffer , the mind will at the same time be better adapted for perception . And the more independent a body may be of other bodies , the stronger will be the understanding of the mind . Thus we can determine the superiority of one mind over another . All bodies are either moving or resting . Every body moves sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other by degrees of motion and quiescence , not with regard to substance . All bodies agree in some aspects . Bodies affect each other in motion and rest . Each individual thing must necessarily be determined as to motion or rest by some other thing . The human body needs for its preservation many other bodies by which it is , as it were , regenerated . The human mind increases its aptitude in proportion to the number of ways in which the body can be disposed . The idea constituting a formal being of the human mind is not simple , but is highly complex . An idea of each component part of the body must necessarily exist in God . The human mind does not know the human body itself , nor does it know that the human body exists , except through the ideas and affections by which the body is affected . Indeed , the human mind is the very idea or knowledge of the human body . These ideas are in God . Thought is an attribute of God , and so the thought of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas which are in God always agree with those things of which they are ideas , and therefore they are all true . Falsity consists in privation of knowledge , involved in confusion and mutilation of ideas . For instance , because they think themselves to be free , and the sole reason for this opinion is that they are conscious of their own actions , and ignorant of the causes determining those actions . Nobody knows what the will is and how it moves to-day . Those who pretend otherwise and invent locations of the soul , usually excite derision and disgust . When we look at the sun and imagine it to be immensely nearer to us than it really is , the error arises from the manner in which the essence of the sun affects the body , not merely from the exercise of the imagination . @# Mutual Influences The more things the body possesses in common with other bodies , the more things will the mind be adapted to perceive . The human mind possesses an adequate knowledge of the eternal and infinite essence of God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of God as clear as that which they have of common notions is that they can not imagine God as they can imagine bodies , and because they have attached the name of God to the images of things they are accustomed to see . This they can hardly avoid , because they are constantly affected by external bodies . And , indeed most errors arise from our application to the wrong names of things . For if some one says that the lines drawn from the centre to the circumference of a circle are unequal , it is because he understands by a circle something different from what we understand by the mathematicians . I did not reckon a man to be in error whom I recently heard complaining that his court has flown into one of his neighbour 's fowls for I understand what he meant . In the mind there is no absolutely free will . The mind is determined to this or that volition by a cause , which is determined by another cause , and so on ad infinitum . The will and intellect are one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature in proportion as we more and more understand God and conform our actions to his will . Our highest happiness consists in this conformity , by which alone the soul finds repose . Those greatly err from the true estimate of virtue who expect to be rewarded for it , as though virtue and the service of God were our felicity itself and the highest liberty . @# III .  --  Concerning Mental Affections The actions of the mind arise from adequate ideas alone ; but the passions depend on those alone which are inadequate . The essence of the mind is composed of adequate and inadequate ideas . Joy is a passion by which the mind passes to a greater degree of perfection ; sorrow is a passion by which it passes to a lesser degree . Accidentally anything may be the cause of joy , sorrow , or desire . We love or hate certain things not from any known cause , but merely from sympathy or antipathy . If we hate a thing , we seek to affirm concerning it everything that we think can affect it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can affect it with joy . From this we see how easily a man may think too much of himself , and of the object which he loves , and on the other hand , may think too little of what he hates . When a man thinks too much of himself this imagination is termed pride , and is a species of delirium , because he dreams with his eyes open , that he can do all those things to which he attains in imagination alone , regarding them thus as realities , and rejoicing in them so long as he can not imagine anything to exclude their existence and limit his power of action . If we imagine that a person loves , desires , or hates a thing which we love , desire , or hate , we shall on that account love , desire , or hate the thing more intensely . If , on the other hand , we imagine that he is averse to the thing we love , or loves the thing to which we are averse , then we shall suffer vacillation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ induce others to love what he loves and to hate what he hates . This effort is called ambition , which prompts each person to desire that others should live according to his way of thinking . But if all thus act , then all hinder each other . And if all wish to be praised or loved by all , then all hate one another . Joy is a man 's passage from a less to a greater perfection ; sorrow is a man 's passage from a greater to a less perfection . I say passage , for joy is not perfection itself . If a man were born with the perfection to which he passes , he would possess it without the affection of joy  --  a truth the more vividly apparent from the affection of sorrow which is the contrary of joy . For , that sorrow consists in the passage to a less perfection , but not in the less perfection itself , no one can deny , since in so far as a man partakes of any perfection , he can not be sad . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a less perfection , for privation is nothing . But the affection of sorrow is actual , and so can be nothing else than the passage to a lesser perfection , that is , the reality by which the power of acting is limited or diminished . As for the definitions of cheerfulness , pleasurable excitement , melancholy , or grief , I omit these , because they are related rather to the body than to the mind , and are merely different species of joy and sorrow . Love is joy with the accompanying idea of an external cause . Hatred is sorrow with the accompanying idea of an external cause . Devotion is love towards an object which we admire and wonder at . Derision is joy arising from the imagination that something we despise is present in the object we hate . Hope is a joy not constant , arising from the idea of something future or past , about the issue of which we are doubtful . Fear is sorrow not constant , arising in like manner . Confidence is joy arising from the idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubting has been removed . Despair is sorrow arising from a like cause . Confidence springs from hope , despair from fear . Pride is thinking too highly of ourselves from self-love . Despondency is thinking too little of ourselves through sorrow . @# IV .  --  Concerning Human Bondage and Human Liberty Good is that which is useful to us ; evil , that which impedes the possession of good . But the terms good and evil are not positive , but are only modes of thought , by which we compare one thing with another . Thus , music is good to a melancholy mind , bad to a mourning mind , but neither bad nor good to a deaf man . We suffer because we form a part of nature . The power by which we preserve our being is the power of God , that is part of His essence . But man is subject to passions because he follows the order of nature . An affection can only be overcome by a stronger affection . That which tends to conserve our existence we denominate good . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ springing from the knowledge of good and evil can be restrained by desires originating in the affections by which we are agitated . Thus the effect of external causes on the mind may be far greater than that of the knowledge of good and evil . The desire springing from a knowledge of good and evil may be easily restrained by the desire of present objects . Opinion exercises a more potent influence than reason . Hence the saying of the poet , " I approve the better , but follow the worse . " And hence also the preacher says " He that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow . " We ought to know both the strength and the weakness of our nature , that we may judge what reason can and can not do in controlling our affections . Desire springing from joy preponderates over that springing from sorrow . Man is useful to man because two individuals of the same nature when in sympathy are stronger than one . Nothing could be so good for men as that all should so agree in everything as to form as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good of all . Hence , men acting in accord with the dictates of reason desire nothing for themselves but what they desire for all . This renders them just , faithful , and honourable . The knowledge of God is the supreme mental good , and to know God is the supreme mental virtue . For God is the supreme subject of the understanding , and therefore to know or understand God is the supreme virtue of the mind . But to us nothing can be either good or evil unless it has something in common with us . An object whose nature is absolutely foreign to our own can not be either good or evil to us , for this reason , that we only call a thing good or evil when it is the cause of joy or sorrow , this is to say , when it increases or diminishes our power to act . Nothing can be reckoned good except that which is in harmony with our nature , and nothing can be reckoned evil expect what is contrary to our nature , but men can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to passion . We only act in harmony with the dictates of reason when we agree in nature with others . Men are most useful to each other who are mutually ruled by the laws of reason . But rarely do men live thus in harmony with reason , and thus it comes to pass that they are commonly envious of each other . Yet men are seldom disposed to solitude , but answer generally to the familiar description of man as a social animal , for they know that the advantages preponderate over the advantages of social life . They find by experience that by mutual aid and co-operation they can , on the one hand the more easily secure what they need , and on the other hand the better defend themselves from danger . A man who seeks after virtue will desire others to do so , and this desire will increase in proportion to this increase of his knowledge of God . The good that a man seeks by the quest of virtue he will wish others to obtain also . This is in accordance with reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the essence of the mind , that essence of the mind being knowledge , which involves the knowledge of God . The greater the knowledge of God involved in the essence of the mind , the greater will be the desire that others may seek after the same virtue which the man seeks for himself . @# @# Economics @# @# EDWARD BELLAMY Looking Backward Edward Bellamy , American social reformer , who sprang into fame in the last decade of the nineteenth century by his book , " Looking Backward , " was born in Massachusetts , on March 25 , 1850 . Trained for the Bar , he became a journalist , and devoted his pen to the propaganda of socialism . After the unprecedented success of his socialist novel , in which he describes a suppositious twentieth century revolution from the standpoint of a hypnotised sleeper awakened in 2000 A.D. , his modest home at Chicopee Falls became a recognised centre of the socialist movement in the United States . " Looking Backward " was published in 1888 , and was followed by " Equality , " in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the story being treated merely as a sequel to the earlier book , and entirely subordinated to the more serious aim . We have here preferred to classify " Looking Backward " as a work of philosophy , and not as fiction . Bellamy 's championship of the rights of the disinherited , and his enlightened ideas , conveyed in a by no means unimaginative style , gained him many friends and sympathisers . Bellamy died on May 22 , 1898. @# I.  --  The Great Change I first saw the light in the city of Boston , in the year 1857 . " What ! " you say , " eighteen-fifty-seven ? That is an odd slip . He means nineteen-fifty-seven , of course . " I beg pardon , but there is no mistake . It was about four in the afternoon of December 26 , one day after Christmas , in the year 1857 , not 1957 , that I , Julian West , first breathed the east wind of Boston , which , I assure the reader , was at that remote period marked by the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 2000 . Living in luxury , and occupied only with the pursuit of the pleasures and refinements of life , I derived the means of my support from the labour of others , rendering no sort of service in return . Why , you ask , should the world have supported in utter idleness one who was able to render service ? The answer is , that my great-grandfather had accumulated a sum of money , on the yield of which his descendants had ever since lived . " Interest on investments " was a species of tax on industry which a person possessing or inheriting money was then able to levy , in spite of all the efforts to put down usury . I can not do better than compare society as it then was to a prodigious coach to which the masses were harnessed and dragged toilsomely along a very hilly and sandy road , with Hunger for driver . The passengers comfortably seated on the top would call down encouragingly to the toilers at the rope , exhorting them to patience ; but always expected to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought , they were not like their brothers who pulled at the rope , but of finer clay , in some way belonging to a higher order of beings . In 1887 , I was engaged to wed Edith Bartlett . She , like myself , rode on the top of the coach . Our marriage only awaited the completion of a house , which , however , was delayed by a series of strikes . I remember Mr. Bartlett saying : " The working classes all over the world seem to be going crazy at once . In Europe it is far worse even than here . " The family mansion , in which I lived alone with a faithful coloured servant by the name of Sawyer , was not a house to which I could think of bringing a bride , much less so dainty a one as Edith Bartlett . Being a sufferer from insomnia , I had caused a secret sleeping chamber to be built of stone beneath the foundation , and when even the silence of this retreat failed to bring slumber , I sometimes called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep , from which Sawyer knew how to arouse me at a given time . On the night of May 30 , 1887 , I was put to sleep as usual . That night the house was wholly destroyed by fire ; and it was not until a hundred and thirteen years later , in September 2000 A.D. , that the subterranean chamber was discovered , and myself , the sleeper , aroused by Dr. Leete , a physician of Boston on the retired list . My companion , Dr. Leete , led the way to a belvedere on the house-top . " Be pleased to look around you , " he said , " and tell me whether this is the Boston of the nineteenth century . " At my feet lay a great city . Miles of broad streets , shaded by trees , and lined with fine buildings , for the most part not in continuous blocks , but set in larger or smaller enclosures , stretched in every direction . Every quarter contained large open squares filled with trees , among which statues glistened and fountains flashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colossal size and an architectural grandeur unparalleled in my day raised their stately piles on every side . Surely , I had never before seen this city , nor one comparable to it . Raising my eyes at last towards the horizon , I looked westward . That blue ribbon winding away to the sunset , was it not the sinuous Charles ? I looked east : Boston harbour stretched before me with its headlands , not one of its green islets missing . " If you had told me , " I said , profoundly awed , " that a thousand years instead of a hundred had elapsed since I last looked on this city , I should now believe you . " " Only a century has passed , " he answered ; " but many a millennium in the world 's history has seen changes less extraordinary . " @# II .  --  How the Great Change Came About After Dr. Leete had responded to numerous questions on my part , he asked in what point the contrast between the new and the old city struck me most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I replied , " I really think that the complete absence of chimneys and their smoke is the detail that first impressed me . " " Ah ! " ejaculated my companion . " I had forgotten the chimneys , it is so long since they went out of use . It is nearly a century since the crude method of combustion , on which you depended for heat , became obsolete . " " In general , " I said , " what impresses me most about the city is the material prosperity on the part of the people which its magnificence implies . " " I would give a great deal for just one glimpse of the Boston of your day , " replied Dr. Leete . " No doubt the cities of that period were rather shabby affairs . If you had the taste to make them splendid , which I would not be so rude as to question , the general poverty resulting from your extraordinary industrial system would not have given you the means . Moreover , the excessive individualism was inconsistent with much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surplus wealth so popular as the adornment of the city , which all enjoy in equal degree . It is growing dark , " he added . " Let us descend into the house ; I want to introduce my wife and daughter to you . " The apartment in which we found the ladies , as well as the entire interior of the house , was filled with a mellow light , which I knew must be artificial , although I could not discover the source from which it was diffused . Mrs. Leete was an exceptionally fine-looking and well-preserved woman , while her daughter , in the first blush of womanhood , was the most beautiful girl I had ever seen . In this lovely creature feminine softness and delicacy were deliciously combined with an appearance of health and abounding physical vitality too often lacking in the maidens with whom alone I could compare her . The evening which followed was certainly unique in the history of social intercourse . When the ladies retired , Dr. Leete sounded me as to my disposition for sleep , but gladly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . I was curious , too , as to the changes . " To make a beginning somewhere , " said I , " what solution , if any , have you found for the labour question ? It was the Sphinx 's riddle of the nineteenth century , and when I dropped out the Sphinx was threatening to devour society because the answer was not forthcoming . " " The riddle may be said to have solved itself , " replied Dr. Leete . " The solution came as the result of a process of industrial evolution which could not have terminated otherwise . The movement toward the conduct of business by larger and larger aggregations of capital  --  the tendency toward monopolies , which had been desperately and vainly resisted  --  was recognised at last as a process to a golden future . " Early in the last century the evolution was completed by the final consolidation of the entire capital of the nation . The industry and commerce of the country , ceasing to be conducted by a set of irresponsible corporations and syndicates of private persons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a single syndicate representing the people , to be conducted for the common profit . That is to say , the nation organised itself as one great business corporation in which all other corporations were absorbed . It became the one capitalist , the sole employer , the final monopoly , in the profits and economies of which all citizens shared . The epoch of trusts ended in the Great Trust . In a word , the people of the United States concluded to assume the conduct of their own business , just as a hundred odd years earlier they had assumed the conduct of their own government . Strangely late in the world 's history , the obvious fact was perceived that no business is so essentially the public business as the industry and commerce on which the people 's livelihood depends , and that to entrust it to private persons to be managed for private profit is a folly similar in kind , though vastly greater in magnitude , to that of surrendering the functions of political government to kings and nobles to be conducted for their personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said I , " did not , of course , take place without bloodshed and terrible convulsions ? " " On the contrary , there was absolutely no violence . The great corporations had taught an entirely new set of ideas . The people had seen syndicates handling revenues ; greater than those of states , and directing the labours of hundreds of thousands of men with an efficiency unattainable in smaller operations . It had come to be recognised as an axiom that the larger the business the simpler the principles that can be applied to it ; that , as the machine is truer than the hand , so the system , which in a great concern does the work of the master 's eye , in a small business turns out more accurate results . Thus , thanks to the corporations themselves , when it was proposed that the nation should assume their functions , the suggestion implied nothing that seemed impracticable . " " In my day , " said I , " it was considered that the proper functions of government , strictly speaking , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public enemy . " " And , in heaven 's name , who are the public enemies ? " exclaimed Dr. Leete . " Are they France , England , Germany ? or Hunger , Cold , Nakedness ? In your day governments were accustomed , on the slightest international misunderstanding , to seize upon the bodies of citizens and deliver them over by hundreds of thousands to death and mutilation , wasting their treasures the while like water ; and all this oftenest for no imaginable profit to the victims . We have no wars now , and our governments no war powers ; but in order to protect every citizen against hunger , cold , and nakedness , and provide for all his physical and mental needs , the function is assumed of directing his industry for a term of years . Not even for the best ends would men now allow their governments such powers as were then used for the most maleficent . " " Leaving comparisons aside , " I said , " the demagoguery and corruption of our public men would have been considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge of the national industries . " " No doubt you were right , " rejoined Dr. Leete ; " but all that is changed . We have no parties or politicians . " " Human nature itself must have changed very much . " " Not at all ; but the conditions of human life have changed , and with them the motives of human action . The organisation of society with you was such that officials were under a constant temptation to misuse their power for the private profit of themselves or others . Now society is so constituted that there is absolutely no way in which an official could possibly make any profit for himself or anyone else by a misuse of his power . " @# III .  --  Labour 's New Regime " But you have not yet told me how you have settled the labour problem . " " When the nation became the sole employer , " said Dr. Leete , " all the citizens became employees , to be distributed according to the needs of industry . " " That is , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as understood in our day , to the labour question . " " Yes . Nevertheless , to speak of service being compulsory would be a weak way to state its absolute inevitableness . If it were conceivable that a man could escape it , he would be left with no possible way to provide for his existence . The period of industrial service is twenty-four years , beginning at the close of the course of education at twenty-one , and terminating at forty-five . After forty-five , the citizen is liable to special calls for labour emergencies till fifty-five . " " But what administrative talent can be equal to determining wisely what trade or business every individual in a great nation shall pursue ? " " The administration has nothing to do with determining that point . Every man determines it for himself in accordance with his natural aptitude , the utmost pains being taken to enable him to find out what his natural aptitude really is . Usually , long before he is mustered into service , a young man has found out the pursuit he wants to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and is awaiting impatiently the time when he can enlist in its ranks . " " Surely , it can hardly be that the number of volunteers for any trade is exactly the number needed ? " " The supply is always expected to equal fully the demand . The rate of volunteering is closely watched . It is the business of the administration to equalise the attractions of the trades , so that the lightest trades have the longest hours , while an arduous trade , such as mining , has very short hours . " " How is the class of common labourers recruited ? " " It is the grade to which all new recruits belong for the first three years . If a man were so stupid as to have no choice as to occupation , he would simply remain a common labourer . " " Having once elected and entered on a trade or occupation , I suppose he has to stick to it the rest of his life ? " " Not necessarily , " replied Dr. Leete ; " while frequent and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worker is allowed , of course under regulations and in accordance with the exigencies of the service , to volunteer for another industry which he thinks would suit him better than his first choice . It is only the poorer sort of workmen who desire to change . Of course , transfers or discharges are always given when health demands them . " " How are the brain-workers selected ? That must require a very delicate sort of sifting process ? " " So it does , the most delicate possible test ; so we leave the question whether a man shall be a brain or handworker entirely to him to settle . At the end of the three years of common labour , if a man feels he can do better work with his brain than his muscles , the schools of technology , medicine , art , music , histrionics , and higher liberal learning are open to him without condition . But anyone without the special aptitude would find it easier to do double hours at his trade than try to keep up with the classes . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till the age of thirty . " @# IV .  --  The New Plan Dr. and Mrs. Leete were startled to learn I had been all over the city alone . " You must have seen a good many new things , " said Mrs. Leete , as we sat down to table . " I think what surprised me as much as anything was not to find any stores in Washington Street , or any banks of State . What have you done with the merchants and bankers ? " " Their functions are obsolete in the modern world . There is neither selling nor buying , and we have no money . As soon as the nation became the producer of all sorts of commodities , there was no need of exchanges between individuals . Everything was procurable from one source , and that only . A system of direct distribution from the national storehouses took the place of trade , and for this money was unnecessary . " " How is this distribution managed ? " " A credit , corresponding to his share of the annual product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public books at the beginning of each year , and a credit-card issued him , with which he procures at the public stores , found in every community , whatever he desires , whenever he desires it . " You observe , " he pursued , as I was curiously examining the piece of pasteboard he gave me , " that this credit-card is issued for a certain number of dollars . We keep the old term dollars as an algebraical symbol for comparing the values of products with one another . All are priced in dollars and cents , just as in your day . The value of what I procure on this card is checked off by the clerk , who pricks out of these tiers of squares the price of what I order . " " If you wanted to buy something of your neighbour , could you transfer part of your credit to him ? " " Our neighbours have nothing to sell us ; but , in any event , one 's credit would not be transferable , being strictly personal . Before the nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be bound to inquire into its equity . It would have been reason enough , had there been no other , for abolishing money , that its possession was no indication of rightful title to it . In the hands of the man who had stolen it , it was as good as if earned by industry . " People nowadays interchange gifts , but buying and selling is considered absolutely inconsistent with the mutual benevolence and disinterestedness which should prevail between citizens . According to our ideas , the practice of buying and selling is essentially anti-social in all its tendencies . It is an education in self-seeking at the expense of others , and no society whose citizens are trained in such a school can possibly rise above a very low grade of civilisation . " " What if you have to spend more than your card allows in any one year ? " " If extraordinary expenses should exhaust it we can obtain a limited advance on next year 's credit at a heavy discount . If a man showed himself a reckless spendthrift he would receive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if necessary , not be permitted to handle it at all . " " If you do n't spend your allowance , I suppose it accumulates ? " " That is also permitted to a certain extent when a special outlay is anticipated . But unless notice is given , it is presumed that the citizen who does not fully expend his credit did not have occasion to do so , and the balance is turned into the general surplus . " " Such a system does not encourage saving habits . " " It is not intended to . No man has care for the morrow , either for himself or his children , for the nation guarantees the nurture , education , and maintenance of every citizen from the cradle to the grave . " " But what inducement can a man have to put forth his best endeavours when , however much or little he accomplishes , his income remains the same ? " " Does it then really seem to you that human nature is insensible to any motives save fear of want and love of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to leave men without incentives to effort ? Your contemporaries did not really think so . When it was a question of the grandest class of efforts , the most absolute self-devotion , they depended on quite other motives . Not higher wages , but honour and the hope of men 's gratitude , patriotism , and the inspiration of duty were the motives they set before their soldiers . Now that industry of whatever sort is no longer self-service , but service of the nation , patriotism  --  passion for humanity  --  impels the worker as in your day it did the soldier . " During the next few days I investigated many other of the social and domestic arrangements of Bostonians of the twenty-first century , and from what I saw myself and heard from my hosts , I gained some tolerably clear ideas of modern organisation , and the system of distribution . But it seemed to me that the system of production and the direction of the industrial army must be wonderfully complex and difficult . " I assure you that it is nothing of the kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of production and constructive industry is divided into ten great departments , each representing a group of allied industries , each industry being in turn represented by a subordinate bureau , which has a complete record of the plant and force under its control , of the present output , and means of increasing it . The estimates of the distributive department , after adoption by the administration , are sent as mandates to the ten great departments , which allot them to the subordinate bureaus representing the particular industries , and these set the men at work . Each bureau is responsible for the task given it . Even if in the hands of the consumer an article turns out unfit , the system enables the fault to be traced back to the original workman . After the necessary contingents of labour have been detailed for the various industries , the amount of labour left for other employment is expended in creating fixed capital , such as buildings , machinery , engineering works , and so forth . " That evening and the next following I sat up late talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thirteen years ; but on the Sunday , my first in the twenty-first century , I fell into a state of profound depression , accentuated by consideration of the vast moral gap between the century to which I belonged and that in which I found myself . There was no place anywhere for me . I was neither dead nor properly alive . Now I realised the mingled pity , curiosity , and aversion which I , as a representative of an abhorred epoch , must excite in all around me ; but that Edith Leete must share their feelings was more than I could bear . Towards nightfall I entered the subterranean chamber and sat down there , feeling utterly alone . Presently Edith stood in the door . " Has it never occurred to you , " I said , " that my position is more utterly alone than any human being 's ever was before ? " " Oh , you must not talk in that way . You do n't know how it makes me feel to see you so forlorn , " she exclaimed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you so blind as not to see why such kindness as you have all shown me is not enough to make me happy ? " " Are you sure it is not you who are blind ? " she said . That was all ; but it was enough , for it told me that this radiant daughter of a golden age had bestowed upon me not alone her pity , but her love . And now I first knew what was perhaps the strangest feature of my strange experience : Edith was the great grand-daughter of no other than my lost love Edith Bartlett . @# @# JEREMY BENTHAM Principles of Morals and Legislation Jeremy Bentham , the son and grandson of attorneys , was born in London on February 15 , 1748 .

Bentham 's failure at the Bar caused him no small disappointment , and it was not until the publication of a " Fragment on Government " in 1776 that he felt himself redeemed with public opinion . The " Principles of Morals and Legislation " was first published in 1789 , but was actually in print nine years earlier . It was primarily intended as the introductory volume of a complete work designed to cover the whole field of the principles of legislation  --  principles which , as we have seen , were based on that doctrine of utility which the author regarded as equally the basis of ethics . @# I.  --  Calculation of Pleasures and Pains Mankind is governed by pain and pleasure . Utility is that property in anything which tends to produce happiness in the party concerned , whether an individual or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for approval or disapproval of every kind of action . An act which conforms to this principle is one which ought to be done , or is not one which ought not to be done ; is right , or , at least , not wrong . There is no other criterion possible which can not ultimately be reduced to the personal sentiment of the individual . The sources or sanctions of pleasure and pain are four  --  the physical , in the ordinary course of nature ; political , officially imposed ; moral or popular , imposed by public opinion ; and religion . Pains under the first head are calamities ; under the other three are punishments . Under the first three heads , they concern the present life only . The second , third , and the fourth , as concerns this life , operate through the first ; but the first operates independently of the others . Pleasures and pains , then , are the instruments with which the legislator has to work ; he must , therefore , be able to gauge their relative values . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , duration , certainty or uncertainty , propinquity or remoteness . Secondarily , on fecundity , the consequent probable multiplication of the like sensations ; and purity , the improbability of consequent contrary sensations . Finally , on extent  --  the number of persons pleasurably or painfully affected . All these being weighed together , if the pleasurable tendency predominates , the act is good ; if the painful , bad . Pleasures and pains are either simple or complex  --  i.e. , resolvable into several simple pleasures , and may be enumerated ; as those of the senses , of wealth , of piety , of benevolence , of malevolence , of association , of imagination . Different persons are sensible to the same pleasure in different degrees , and the sensibility of the individual varies under different circumstances . Circumstances affecting sensibility are various  --  such as health , strength , sex , age , education ; they may be circumstances of the body , of the mind , of the inclinations . Their influence can be reckoned approximately , but should be taken into consideration so far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the existing causes of pleasure and pain , but of pain rather than pleasure  --  the mischiefs which it is desired to prevent , and the punishments by which it is sought to prevent them  --  and for the due apportionment of the latter they should have before them the complete list of punishments and of circumstances affecting sensibility . By taking the two together  --  with one list or the other for basis , preferably the punishment list  --  a classification of appropriate penalties is attainable . An analytical summary of the circumstances affecting sensibility will distinguish as secondary  --  i.e. , as acting not immediately but mediately through the primary  --  sex , age , station in life , education , climate , religion . The others , all primary , are connate  --  viz. , radical frame of mind and body  --  or adventitious . The adventitious are personal or exterior . The personal concern a man 's disposition of body or mind , or his actions ; the exterior the things or the persons he is concerned with . @# II .  --  Human Actions Analysed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society by rewarding and punishing , especially by punishing acts tending to diminish happiness . An act demands punishment in proportion to its tendency to diminish happiness  --  i.e. , as the sum of its consequences does so . Only such consequences are referred to as influence the production of pain or pleasure . The intention , as involving other consequences , must also be taken into consideration . And the intention depends on the state both of the will and of the understanding as to the circumstances  --  consciousness , unconsciousness , or false consciousness regarding them . Hence with regard to each action we have to consider ( 1 ) the act itself , ( 2 ) the circumstances , ( 3 ) the intentionality , ( 4 ) the attendant consciousness , and also ( 5 ) the motive , and ( 6 ) the general disposition indicated . Acts are positive and negative  --  i.e. , of commission and omission , or forbearance ; external or corporal , and internal or mental ; transitive , affecting some body other than the agent 's , or intransitive ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as habit ) . Circumstances are material when visibly related to the consequences in point of casuality , directly or indirectly . They may be criminative , or exculpative , or aggravative , or evidential . The intention may regard the act itself only , or its consequences also  --  for instance , you may touch a man intentionally , and by doing so cause his death unintentionally . But you can not intend the consequences  --  though you may have desired them  --  without intending the action . The consequences may be intended directly or indirectly , and may or may not be the only thing intended . The intention is good or bad as the consequences intended are good or bad . But these actually depend on the circumstances which are independent of the intention ; here the important point is the man 's consciousness of the circumstances , which are objects not of the will , but of the understanding . If he is conscious of the circumstances and of their materiality , the act is advised ; if not , unadvised . Unadvisedness may be due either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remark that we may speak of a bad intention , though the motive was good , if the consequences intended were bad , and vice versa . In this sense also , the intention may be innocent  --  that is , not bad , without being positively good . Of motives , we are concerned with practical motives only , not those which are purely speculative . These are either internal or external ; either events in esse , or events in prospect . The immediate motive is an internal motive in esse  --  an awakened pleasure or pain at the prospect of pleasure or pain . All others are comparatively remote . Now , since the motive is always primarily to produce some pleasure or prevent some pain , and since pleasure is identical with good , and pain with evil , it follows that no motive is in itself bad . The motive is good if it tends to produce a balance of pleasure ; bad , if a balance of pain . Thus any and every motive may produce actions good , indifferent , or bad . Hence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms , i.e. , not such as are associated with goodness as  --  piety , honour  --  or with badness  --  as lust , avarice . The motives , of course , correspond to the various pleasures as previously enumerated . They may be classified as good , bad , or indifferent , according as their consequences are more commonly good , bad , or indifferent ; but the dangers of such classification are obvious . In fact , we can not affirm goodness , badness , or indifference of motive , except in the particular instance . A better classification is into the social  --  including goodwill , love of reputation , desire of amity , religion ; dissocial  --  displeasure ; self-regarding  --  physical desire , pecuniary interest , love of power , self-preservation . Of all these , the dictates of goodwill are the surest of coinciding with utility , since utility corresponds precisely to the widest and best-advised goodwill . Even here , however , there may be failure , since benevolence towards one group may clash with benevolence towards another . Next stands love of reputation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to asceticism and hypocrisy . Third comes the desire of amity , valuable as the sphere in which amity is sought is extended , but also liable to breed insincerity . Religion would stand first of all if we all had a correct perception of the divine goodness ; but not when we conceive of God as malevolent or capricious ; and , as a matter of fact , our conception of the Deity is controlled by our personal biases . The self-regarding motives are , ex hypothesi , not so closely related to utility as the social motives , and the dissocial motives manifestly stand at the bottom of the scale . In respect to any particular action there may be a conflict of motives , some impelling towards it , others restraining from it ; and any motive may come in conflict with any other motive . It will be found hereafter that in the case of some offences the motive is material in the highest degree , and in others wholly immaterial ; in some cases easy , and in others impossible to gauge . @# III . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , can not be predicated of the motive . What is good or bad in the man when actuated by one motive or another is his disposition , or permanent attitude of mind , which is good or bad as tending to produce effects beneficial to the community . It is to be considered in regard to its influence on ( 1 ) his own happiness ; ( 2 ) other people 's . The legislator is concerned with it so far as it is mischievous to others . A man is held to be of a mischievous disposition when it is presumed  --  for it is a mere presumption  --  that he inclines to acts which appear to him mischievous . Here it is that " intentionality " and " consciousness " come in . Where the tendency of the act is good , and the motive is a social one , a good disposition is indicated ; where the tendency is bad , and the motive is self-regarding , a bad disposition is indicated . Otherwise , the indication of good or bad disposition may be very dubious or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now , our problem is to measure the depravity of a man 's disposition , which may be defined as the sum of his intentions . The causes of intentions are motives . The social motives may be called tutelary , as tending to restrain from mischievous intentions ; but any motive may become tutelary on occasion . Love of ease , and desire of self-preservation , in the form of fear of punishment , are apt to be tutelary motives . Now we can see that the strength of a temptation equals the sum of the impelling motives , minus the sum of the tutelary motives . Hence , the more susceptible a man is to the standing tutelary motives , the less likely is he to yield to temptation ; in other words , the less depraved is his disposition . Hence , given the strength of the temptation , the mischievousness of the disposition is as the apparent mischievousness of the act . Given the apparent mischievousness of the act , the less the temptation yielded to , the greater the depravity of disposition ; but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of depravity . It follows that the penalty should be increased  --  i.e. , the fear of punishment should be artificially intensified , in proportion as , apart from that fear , the temptation is stronger . We now come to consequences . The mischief of the act is the sum of its mischievous consequences , primary and secondary . The primary mischief subdivides into original , i.e. , to the sufferer in the first instance ; and derivative , to the definite persons who suffer as a direct consequence , whether through their interest , or merely through sympathy . The secondary mischiefs , affecting not specific persons but the community , are actual danger , or alarm  --  the apprehension of pain . For the occurrence of the act points to the possibility of its repetition ; weakening the influence both of the political and of the moral sanction . An act of which the primary consequences are mischievous may have secondary beneficial consequences , which altogether outweigh the primary mischief  --  e.g. , the legal punishment of crime . The circumstances influencing the secondary mischiefs of alarm and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the disposition ; danger depending on the real , and alarm on the apparent , state of mind , though the real and the apparent coincide more commonly than not . Between the completely intentional and completely unintentional act there are various stages , depending on the degree of consciousness , as explained above . The excellence of the motive does not obliterate the mischievousness of the act ; nor vice versa ; but the mischief may be aggravated by a bad motive , as pointing to greater likelihood of repetition . This is less the case , however , when the motive is dissocial , such motives being generally less constant , as having reference to a particular , not a general , object ; the religious motive , as being more constant , is more pernicious when it has a mischievous issue . Punishment , being primarily mischievous , is out of place when groundless , inefficacious , unprofitable , or needless . Punishment is inefficious when it is ex post facto , or extra-legal , or secret ; or in the case of irresponsible ( including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intention of the act was incomplete , or where the act was actually or practically under compulsion . It is unprofitable when under ordinary circumstances the evils of the punishment outweigh those of the offence ; this subject , however , will be more fully dealt with later . It is needless when the end in view can be as well or better attained otherwise . Now , the aim of the legislator is ( 1 ) to prevent mischief altogether ; ( 2 ) to minimise the inclination to do mischief ; ( 3 ) to make the prevention cheap . Hence , ( 1 ) the punishment must outweigh the profit of the offence to the doer ; ( 2 ) the greater the mischief , the greater the expense worth incurring to prevent it ; ( 3 ) alternative offences which are not equally mischievous , as robbery and robbery with murder , must not be equally punished ; ( 4 ) the punishment must not be excessive , and therefore should take into account the circumstances influencing sensibility ; ( 5 ) so also must the weakness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impelling force of habit . The properties of punishment necessary to its adjustment to a particular offence are these : ( 1 ) variability in point of quantity , so that it shall be neither excessive nor deficient ; ( 2 ) equality , so that when applied in equal degree , it shall cause equal pain  --  e.g. , banishment may mean much to one man , little to another ; ( 3 ) commensurability with other punishments ; ( 4 ) characteristicalness , or appropriateness ; ( 5 ) exemplarity  --  it must not seem less than it is in fact ; ( 6 ) frugality  --  none of the pain it causes is to be wasted . Minor desirable qualities are ( 7 ) subserviency to reformation of character ; ( 8 ) efficiency in disabling from mischief ; ( 9 ) subserviency to compensation ; ( 10 ) popularity , i.e. , accordant to common approbation ; ( 11 ) remissibility. @# IV .  --  Division of Offences An offence  --  a punishable act  --  is constituted such by the community ; though it ought not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be so . It is assumed to be a detrimental act ; detrimental therefore to some person or persons , whether the offender himself or other assignable persons , or to persons not assignable . Offences against assignable persons other than the offender form the first class ; offences against individuals , or private offences , or private extra-regarding offences . The second class is formed by semi-public offences , i.e. , not against assignable individuals , nor the community at large , but a separable group in the community , e.g. , a class or a locality . The third class are those which are simply self-regarding ; the fourth , against the community at large ; the fifth , multiform or heterogeneous , comprising falsehood and breaches of trust . The first class may be subdivided into offences against ( 1 ) the person , ( 2 ) reputation , ( 3 ) property , ( 4 ) condition  --  i.e. , the serviceableness to the individual of other persons , ( 5 ) person and property together , ( 6 ) person and reputation together . The second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endanger a portion of the community , are those operating through calamity , or of mere delinquency . The latter are subdivided on the same lines as private offences . So with the third or self-regarding class . In class four , public offences fall under eleven divisions : ( 1 ) offences against external security  --  i.e. , from foreign foes ; ( 2 ) against justice  --  i.e. , the execution of justice ; ( 3 ) against the preventive branch of police ; ( 4 ) against the public force  --  i.e. , military control ; ( 5 ) against increase of national felicity ; ( 6 ) against public wealth  --  i.e. , the exchequer ; ( 7 ) against population ; ( 8 ) against national wealth  --  i.e. , enrichment of the population ; ( 9 ) against sovereignty ; ( 10 ) against religion ; ( 11 ) against national interests in general . In class five , falsehood comprises simple falsehoods , forgery , personation , and perjury ; again distributable like the private offences . In the case of trusts , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Offences under this head can not , for various reasons , be conveniently referred to offences against property or condition , which also must be kept separate from each other . As regards the existence of a trust : as against the trustee , offences are ( 1 ) wrongful non-investment of trust , and wrongful interception of trust , where the trusteeship is to his benefit ; or ( 2 ) where it is troublesome , wrongful imposition of trust . Both may similarly be offences against the beneficiary . As regards the exercise of the trust , we have negative breach of trust , positive breach of trust , abuse of trust , disturbance of trust , and bribery . We may now distribute class one  --  offences against the individual  --  into genera ; to do so with the other classes would be superfluous . Simple offences against the person are actions referring to his actual person , body or mind , or external objects affecting his happiness . These must take effect either through his will , or not . In the former case , either by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In any case the effect will be mortal or not mortal ; if not mortal , reparable or irreparable injury when corporal , actual , or apprehended , sufferance when mental . So the list stands  --  simple and irreparable corporal injuries , simple injurious restraint or constraint , wrongful confinement or banishment , homicide or menacement , actual or apprehended mental injuries . Against reputation the genera of offences are ( i ) defamation , ( 2 ) vilification . Of offences against property , simple in their effects , whether by breach of trust or otherwise , the genera are : wrongful non-investment , interception , divestment , usurpation , investment , of property ; wrongful withholding of services , destruction , occupation , or detainment , embezzlement , theft , defraudment , extortion . Of complex offences against person and reputation together : corporal insults , insulting menacement , seduction , and forcible seduction , simple lascivious injuries . Against person and property together : forcible interception , divestment , usurpation , investment , or destruction of property , forcible occupation or detainment of movables , forcible entry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offences against condition : conditions are either domestic or civil ; domestic relations are either purely natural , purely instituted , or mixed . Of the first , we are concerned only with the marital , parental , and filial relations . Under the second head are the relations of master and servant , guardian and ward . In the case of master and servants , the headings of offences are much like those against property . Guardianship is required in the cases of infancy and insanity ; again the list of offences is similar . The parental and filial relations , so far as they are affected by institutions , comprise those both of master and servant , and of guardian and ward ; so that the offences are correspondent . The relation of husband and wife also comprises those of master and guardian to servant and ward . But there are further certain reciprocal services which are the subject of the marital contract , by which polygamy and adultery are constituted offences in Christian countries , and also the refusal of conjugal rights . From domestic conditions we pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the categories of trusts and domestic conditions , there remain conditions , constituted by beneficial powers over things , beneficial rights to things , rights to services , and by corresponding duties ; and between these and property there is no clear line of demarcation , yet we can hit upon some such conditions as separable . Such are rank and profession which entail specific obligations and rights  --  these are not property but conditions ; as distinguished from other exclusive rights bestowed by the law , concerned with saleable articles ( e.g. , copyright ) , which convey not conditions , but property . So , naturalisation conveys the conditions of a natural born subject . Public offences are to be catalogued in a manner similar to private offences . My object has been to combine intelligibility with precision ; technical terms lack the former quality , popular terms the latter . Hence the plan of the foregoing analysis has been to take the logical whole constituted by the sum of possible offences , dissect it in as many directions as were necessary , and carry the process down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current phraseology . Thus it becomes equally applicable to the legal concerns of all countries or systems . The advantages of this method are : it is convenient for the memory , gives room for general propositions , points out the reason of the law , and is applicable to the laws of all nations . Hence we are able to characterise the five classes of offences . Thus , of private offences , we note that they are primarily against assignable individuals , admit of compensation and retaliation , and so on ; of semi-public offences , that they are not against assignable individuals , and , with self-regarding offences , admit of neither compensation nor retaliation ; to which a series of generalisations respecting each class can be added . The relation between penal jurisprudence and private ethics must be clarified . Both are concerned with the production of happiness . A man 's private ethics are concerned with his duty to himself and to his neighbour ; prudence , probity , and beneficence . Those cases described as unmeet for punishment are all within the ethical , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " cases , which are outside both . The special field of private ethics is among the cases where punishment is " unprofitable " or " inefficacious , " notably those which are the concern of prudence . So with the rules of beneficence ; but beneficence might well be made compulsory in a greater degree than it is . The special sphere of legislation , however , lies in the field of probity . A work of jurisprudence is either expository of what the law is , or censorial , showing what it should be . It may relate to either local or universal jurisprudence ; but if expository can hardly be more than local . It may be internal , or international , though there is very little law in international procedure ; if internal , it may be national or provincial , it may be historical or living ; it may be divided into statutory and customary , into civil and penal or criminal . @# @# JEAN BLOCH The Future of War The son of humble Polish Jews , Jean Bloch , who was born in 1836 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the age of fifty he retired from business , and devoted himself to an exhaustive study of the conditions and possibilities of modern warfare . To this labour he gave eight years , and , in 1898 , the fruits of it were published in a work of six volumes , in which he sought to prove that , owing to the immensity of modern armies , the deadliness of modern weapons , and the economic conditions that prevailed in the larger states , a great European war was rapidly becoming a physical impossibility . M. Bloch died on January 7 , 1902 , not before several of his theories had been tested by actual campaigning . His main argument , however , concerns a war on European frontiers between European powers , and such a war he did not live to witness . @# I.  --  The Problem Stated In the public and private life of modern Europe a presentiment is felt that the present incessant growth of armaments must either call forth a war , ruinous both for conqueror and for conquered , and ending perhaps in general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lamentable condition . Is this unique state of mind justified by possible contingencies ? It is true that the ruinousness of war under modern conditions is apparent to all . But this gives no sufficient guarantee that war will not break forth suddenly , even in opposition to the wishes of those who take part in it . Involuntarily we call to mind the words of the great Bacon , that " in the vanity of the world a greater field of action is open for folly than for reason , and frivolity always enjoys more influence than judgment . " War , it would appear from an analysis of the history of mankind , has in the past been a normal attribute of human life . The position now has changed in much , but still the new continues to contend with the old . With the innumerable voices which are now bound up in our public opinion , and the many different representatives of its interests , naturally appear very different views on militarism and its object  --  war . The propertied classes are inclined to confuse even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social order ; on the other hand , agitators , seeking influence on the minds of the masses , deny all existing rights , and promise to the masses more than the most perfect institutions could give them . And although the masses are slow to surrender themselves to abstract reasoning , and act usually only under the influence of passion , there can be no doubt that this agitation penetrates the people more and more deeply . With such a position of affairs , it is necessary that influential and educated men should seriously attempt to give themselves a clear account of the effect of war under modern conditions ; whether it will be possible to realise the aims of war , and whether the extermination of millions of men will not be wholly without result . If , after consideration of all circumstances , we answer ourselves : " War with such conditions is impossible ; armies could not sustain those cataclysms which a future war would call forth ; the civil population could not bear the famine and interruption of industry " ; then we might ask the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more exhaust their strength in accumulating means of destruction which are valueless even to accomplish the ends for which they are prepared ? " In recent times war has become even more terrible than before in consequence of perfected weapons of destruction and systems of equipment and training utterly unknown in the past . Infantry and artillery fire will have unprecedented force ; smoke will no longer conceal from the survivors the terrible consequences of the battle . From this , and from the fact that the mass of soldiers will have but recently been called from the field , the factory , and the workshop , it will appear that even the psychical conditions of war have changed . The thought of the convulsions which will be called forth by a war , and of the terrible means prepared for it , will hinder military enterprise . But , on the other hand , the present conditions can not continue to exist for ever . The peoples groan under the burdens of militarism . We are compelled to ask : Can the present incessant demands for money for armaments continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ European world , the organic strength of which is wasted , on the one hand , in the sacrifice of millions on preparations for war , and , on the other , in a destructive agitation , which finds in militarism its apology and a fit instrument for acting on the minds of the people , must be admitted to be abnormal and even sickly . Is it possible that there can be no recovery from this ? We are deeply persuaded that a means of recovery exists if the European states would but set themselves the question  --  in what will result these armaments and this exhaustion ? What will be the nature of a future war ? Can recourse be had to war even now for the decision of questions in dispute , and is it possible to conceive the settlement of such questions by means of the cataclysm which , with modern means of destruction , a war between five great powers with ten millions of soldiers would cause ? That war will become impossible in time is indicated by all . The more apposite question is  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among European governments and peoples ? When the impossibility of resorting to war for the decision of international quarrels is evident to all , other means will be devised . @# II .  --  How War Will Be Waged on Land The bullet of the present day can kill at a vastly greater distance than the bullets fired during the Franco-German and Russo-Turkish campaigns . The powder now in use has not only far more explosive force than the old-fashioned powder , but is almost smokeless . The introduction of the magazine rifle has immensely increased the speed of firing . Moreover , the rifle is undergoing constant improvement , and becoming a more and more deadly weapon . It is easy , then , to see the following consequences from these changes : ( 1 ) The opening of battles from much greater distances than formerly ; ( 2 ) the necessity of loose formation in attack ; ( 3 ) the strengthening of the defence ; ( 4 ) the increase in the area of the battlefield ; and ( 5 ) the increase in casualties . If we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range , the speed of fire , the better training of troops in the use of the rifle , and the invention of contrivances to aid markmanship , cause such effectiveness of fire that it would be quite possible for rival armies totally to annihilate each other . But a similar improvement has taken place in artillery . The introduction of the quick-firing gun has multiplied the speed of artillery fire many times over . The range has been increased by the perfecting of the structure of the guns , the use of nickel steel in the manufacture of projectiles , and the employment of smokeless powder of immense explosive force . Artillery fire will now not only be employed against attacking troops , but even more against supporting bodies , which must necessarily advance in closer order , and among whom , therefore , the action of artillery will be even more deadly . We may well ask the question whether the nerves of short-service soldiers will stand the terrible destructiveness of artillery fire . As a necessary consequence of the increase in the power of fire , we find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of cover for protection in attack and hampering the enemy . In addition , every body of men appointed for defence , and even for attack  --  if it is not to attack at once  --  must immediately entrench itself . The defenders , thus sheltered , and only requiring to expose their heads and hands , have an enormous advantage over the attacking party , which is exposed to an uninterrupted fire to which it can hardly reply . In the opinion of competent military writers , the war of the future will consist primarily of a series of battles for the possession of fortified positions , which will further be protected by wire obstructions , pitfalls , etc. , to overcome which great sacrifices must be made . As infantry , even if weak in numbers , can not be driven from an entrenched position without artillery fire , armies in future must find themselves mainly dependent upon artillery . If the defending artillery be equal in strength to that of the attackers , then the attacking artillery will be wiped out . If it be not equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The losses will be so great that the artillery of both armies will be paralysed , or it might be that the artillery would inflict such heavy losses on the troops that the war would become impossible . Owing to smokeless powder , batteries of artillery are more exposed to the fire both of the enemy 's artillery and of sharpshooters . A hundred sharpshooters at a distance of half a mile can , it is estimated , put a battery out of action in less than two minutes and a half . Let it be added that the high explosives used by modern artillery are extremely liable to explode , owing to being struck by the enemy , or owing to concussion caused by an enemy 's shell , or to mishandling . For these reasons , the prospect before an artillery battery entering into a modern European battle is a prospect of demolition . The European infantry of the future will be composed largely of imperfectly trained short-service soldiers and of reserves who have forgotten their training . Infantry soldiers are liable to be killed by bullets from enemies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the distance , they may not even be able to hear . Their officers will be picked off in great numbers by sharpshooters , and they will be left without leaders . It is calculated that an average army is composed one-third of brave men , one-third of cowards , and one-third of men who will be brave if properly led . The loss of the officers must tend to cause this latter section to join the cowards . Furthermore , the enormous area of modern battlefields involves great demands upon the endurance of the foot soldiers , and troops mainly drawn from industrial centres can hardly be expected to meet such demands . Unless the attacking artillery is overwhelmingly stronger than the defending artillery , defensive infantry in an entrenched position can not be ousted from its position unless the attackers outnumber their opponents by six or seven to one , and are prepared to lose heavily . The murderous zone of a thousand yards lying between the armies can not be crossed save at fearful sacrifice , and the bayonet as a weapon of attack is now altogether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the extraordinary qualities needed for the control of a modern European army  --  a whole people possessed of weapons of tremendous power and deadliness , spread over an area of vast extent , engaged upon battles that will necessarily last for days , subjected to a nervous strain such as has never been experienced in warfare ? The responsibility of subordinate officers must , under such circumstances , be far greater than it used to be ; the commander can not keep everything under his eye . And , as already said , the officers will be especially picked out for death . Under all these conditions , it is likely that after battles with enormous slaughter , victory will be claimed by both sides . We must further take into account the influence of a modern war upon populations . What will be the effect on the temper of modern armies if war should be prolonged ? How will the civil population receive the news from the front ? What convulsions must we expect when , after the conclusion of peace , the soldiers return to their destroyed and desolated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it may be assumed , be fought on one or the other frontier of Germany  --  in the Franco-German area on the western side ; or the German-Austro-Russian area on the eastern  --  or on both . Since it would be impossible under modern conditions for Germany , with or without Austrian co-operation , to invade both France and Russia , she would be obliged to defend one frontier while crossing the other . An attack upon France would involve the traversing of a difficult stretch of country in which elaborate arrangements have been made for defence ; and although the French army is not so strong as that of Germany , it would have the enormous advantage of standing on the defensive . Even if Germany were to gain initial successes through her superior swiftness in mobilization , the difficulties of modern warfare are such that she could not hope , even under abnormally favourable circumstances , to capture Paris in less than two years , and long before then she would be reduced to a state of entire economic exhaustion . It is to be borne in mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the defenders would be able to enforce the superiority now belonging to defence by bringing up all their reserves . Difficulties which would be , if possible , even harder to surmount would attend a French attempt to invade Germany . The elaborate plans that have been drawn up for an Austro-German invasion of Russia would , in all probability , be doomed to failure . The defensive system of Russian Poland is regarded as almost perfect . Even if the German and Austrian forces could evade the Polish defences , they would waste their strength against the second Russian fortified line ; and even if that were broken through , St. Petersburg and Moscow would still be far distant , and Russia 's immense resources in men would enable her to bring up body after body of reserves against the dwindling invading force . A Russian invasion of Prussia would have to encounter an elaborately scientific defensive system , and would be liable to all the other difficulties to which an invasion is exposed  --  particularly , in this case , the difficulty of feeding a vast host of men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frontier seems tempting ; but Russia would have to strike at Germany  --  an invasion of Austria which left Germany untouched would be mere waste of energy . The general conclusion is that invasion of an enemy 's country , in a great European struggle , would , in all probability , lead to the destruction of the invaders and the entire exhaustion of both combatants. @# III .  --  Modern War at Sea The modern warship is a floating fortress equipped with complex machinery , and the rivalry in naval invention has led to a terrible expenditure upon which the powers have embarked in utter heedlessness of the warnings of economists . So prodigious is the destructive power of modern naval weapons that , in the opinion of most specialists , vessels which take part in great battles will issue from them damaged to such an extent that , during the rest of the war , they will not need to be taken into account . In war the strongest nation will be that which possesses the greatest number of arsenals and ready stores of ammunition , and coal at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addition to these , a fleet in reserve , even a fleet of old type , but equipped with modern artillery . With such a fleet it will be possible to strike deadly blows at the enemy when the fleets of the first line have been incapacitated . To cruisers and torpedo-boats will be allotted the ferocious duty of pursuing merchant ships , falling upon them at night , and sinking them , with the object of cutting the communications and paralysing the trade of the enemy . The effect of naval wars on trade will in future be incomparably more disastrous than it has ever been before . Calculations show that England alone in a prolonged war could gain the mastery of the sea , forcing the other naval powers to give way everywhere . But the interruption of communications at sea would cause the English such losses that a prolonged war would be impossible for them . Thus , in continuing to increase their fleets and to perfect their armaments at immense cost , the European powers are striving at aims undefined and unattainable . But the financial and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that governments must be compelled after immense sacrifices to do what it would be wiser to do to-day  --  namely , to abandon a fruitless competition . Such is a brief picture of what Europe may expect from a future war . But over and above the direct sacrifices and material losses by slaughter , fire , hunger , and disease , a war will cause to humanity a great moral evil in consequence of the forms which a struggle on sea will assume , and of the examples of savagery which it will present at a moment when the civil order will be threatened by new theories of social revolution . What wearisome labour will be needed to repair the losses , to cure the wounds which a war of a single year will cause ! How many flourishing countries will be turned into wildernesses and rich cities into ruins ! How many tears will be shed , how many will be left in beggary ! How long will it be before the voices of the best men , after such a terrible example , will preach to humanity a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IV .  --  The Warnings of the Economists The conditions of modern war are bound to be the cause of huge expenditure . First of all , military stores must be drawn by every country from its own resources . Artillery , rifles , and ammunition are all far more costly than they used to be , and the amount of ammunition consumed in a modern European campaign will be prodigious . The vastness of armies , and the deadliness of modern weapons , will add immensely to the requirements of the sick and wounded . The demand for provisions must vastly increase , and the increase will be followed by a great rise in prices . That an immense army can not exist on the resources of an enemy 's territory is plain , especially when the slowness of advance in a struggle for fortified positions is taken into account . Communications by sea will be interrupted at the very outbreak of war . In this respect England is in incomparably the worst position . There are serious reasons for doubting the proposition that a future war would be short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be considerably shortened ; but in marches , manoeuvres , and battles railways can be employed only in very rare cases , and as lines of operation they can not serve . The question naturally arises : Will it be possible to raise for war purposes revenues vastly exceeding the normal revenues of European states ? And what results must we expect from such extraordinary tension ? A careful and thorough inquiry shows that no great power is economically capable of bearing the strain of a great war . Russia has in this respect an important advantage in that her workers , who are her fighters , are mostly agricultural ; the members of their families can continue their labours when the summons to war is issued . But , on the other hand , the Russian rural population is extremely poor , and her resources would quickly be exhausted . As for England , the interruption of maritime communications would affect disastrously , if not fatally , the industries of the country and the feeding of her population . England depends to so great an extent upon imported wheat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The very large industrial portion of the German community would be hit most severely . The stoppage of work and the rise in prices would cause intense suffering and violent discontent . Although France survived the economic strain of the war of 1870 , it does not follow that she could endure the far greater strain of a campaign under the new conditions . Her industrial population , like that of Germany , would be ruined , and the resulting misery might well lead to revolution . A great European war , then , would bring about the economic prostration of every nation engaged in it , and would be a cause of violent danger to the fabric of society . Another problem of modern war remains to be considered  --  the condition and care of the wounded . Modern weapons of precision can not only kill or wound more accurately and at greater distances than the older weapons , but have more penetrative power . A rifle bullet of to-day will pass through three or four bodies , shattering and splintering any bones it may encounter in its course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever been ; and , owing to the unwieldly size of armies and the poor physical condition of many of the men , sickness will be more common as well . Nevertheless , the assistance of the wounded and sick will be much more difficult than it has been in the past . While the fighting organisation of armies has been improved , their healing organisation has been neglected . It will , besides , be almost impossible to give aid to the wounded . Their removal will have to be conducted under fire , and both the wounded man and his rescuer will run a constant risk of death . Many wounded will have to lie on the field , exposed to a hail of bullets and fragments of shells , until the end of the battle  --  and the battle may last for days . This can not but have an evil effect on the morale of an army . If a soldier were convinced that he had a good chance of being taken care of if wounded , he would fight with a better spirit than if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left to prolonged hunger and agony . It is evident that a vast difference exists between war as it has been in the past and war as it will be in the future . Wars formerly were carried on by standing armies consisting mainly of long-service soldiers . Armies in future wars will be composed mainly of soldiers taken direct from peaceful occupations ; many of the older ones will be heads of families torn from their homes , their families , and their work . The economic life of whole peoples will stand still , communications will be cut , and if war be prolonged over the greater part of a year , general bankruptcy , with famine and all its worst consequences , will ensue . It is to be expected , therefore , that popular discontent with militarism will continue to grow . The immense expenditure on military aims , and the consequent growth of taxation , are the favourite arguments of agitators , who declare that the institutions of the Middle Ages were less burdensome than modern preparations for war . The question is naturally asked : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compensation for their immense losses ? The conquered certainly will be too exhausted to pay any money indemnity , and compensation must be taken by the retention of frontier territories , which will be so impoverished by war that their acquisition will be a loss rather than a gain . With such conditions , can we hope for good sense among millions of men when but a handful of their officers remain ? Will the armies of Western Europe , where the socialist propaganda has already spread among the masses , allow themselves to be disarmed ; and , if not , must we not expect even greater disasters than those which marked the short-lived triumph of the Paris Commune ? The longer the present position of affairs continues , the greater is the probability of such convulsions after the close of a great war . Thus , with the growth of military burdens rise waves of popular discontent , threatening a social revolution . Such are the consequences of the armed peace of Europe  --  slow destruction in consequence of expenditure on preparations for war , or swift destruction in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the social order . @# @# EDMUND BURKE Reflections on the Revolution in France Edmund Burke , born on Jan. 12 , 1729 , at Dublin , Ireland , was educated at Trinity College there , and proceeded in 1750 to the Middle Temple , London , but forsook law for the pursuit of literature and politics . His earliest serious work was the essay on " The Sublime and Beautiful , " published in 1756 , of which the full title is " A Philosophical Inquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful . " In 1761 he became private secretary to Hamilton , the Secretary of Ireland , and four years later to the Premier , the Marquis of Rockingham , when he also became M.P . for Wendover , and , in 1774 , for Bristol . He died on July 9 , 1797 . Burke 's magnificent treatise on the French Revolution , of which the full title is " Reflections on the Revolution in France , and on the Proceedings of Certain Societies in London relative to that Event ; In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paris , " was published in 1790 , and was read all over Europe , powerfully encouraging strenuous resistance to the Revolution . It is , perhaps , in all literature , the noblest expression of all that is noble in conservatism . His treatise is as profound in its penetration into political principles as it is magnificent in conception and in language . As Burke had stood for a true liberty in America , so he took his stand against a false liberty in Europe . But history has not justified him so completely in the latter case as in the former . Revolutionism was not only , or chiefly , libertinism ; and the wonderful modern France has largely disappointed his predictions . @# I.  --  The Meaning of Freedom Dear Sir , You are pleased to call again , and with some earnestness , for my thoughts on the late proceedings in France . You will see , sir , that though I do most heartily wish that France may be animated by a spirit of rational liberty , it is my misfortune to entertain great doubts concerning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a manly , moral , regulated liberty as well as anyone ; but I can not stand forward and give praise or blame to anything which relates to human actions and human concerns , on a simple view of the subject , as it stands stripped of every relation , in all the nakedness and solitude of metaphysical abstraction . I should , therefore , suspend my congratulations on the new liberty of France until I was informed how it had been combined with government ; with public force ; with the discipline and obedience of armies ; with the collection of an effective and well-distributed revenue ; with morality and religion ; with the solidity of property ; with peace and order ; with civil and social manners . All these , in their way , are good things , too ; and , without them , liberty is not a benefit while it lasts , and is not likely to continue long . The effect of liberty to individuals is that they may do what they please ; we ought to see what it will please them to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I were in a great crisis , not of the affairs of France alone , but of all Europe , perhaps of more than Europe . All circumstances taken together , the French Revolution is the most astonishing that has hitherto happened in the world . Everything seems out of nature in this chaos of levity and ferocity , and of all sorts of crimes jumbled together with all sorts of follies . In viewing this monstrous tragi-comic scene , the most opposite passions succeed , and sometimes mix with each other in the mind ; alternate contempt and indignation ; laughter and tears ; scorn and horror . You will observe that from Magna Charta to the Declaration of Right it has been the uniform policy of our constitution to claim and assert our liberties as an entailed inheritance derived to us from our forefathers and to be transmitted to our posterity . Our political system is placed in a just symmetry with the order of the world ; wherein , by the disposition of a stupendous wisdom , moulding together the great , mysterious incorporation of the human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never old , or middle-aged , or young , but , in a condition of unchangeable constancy , moves on through the varied tenor of perpetual decay , fall , renovation , and progression . We have given to our frame of polity the image of a relation in blood ; binding up the constitution of our country with our dearest domesticities ; keeping inseparable , and cherishing with the warmth of all their combined and mutually reflected charities , our state , our hearths , our sepulchres , and our altars . Always acting as if in the presence of canonised forefathers , the spirit of freedom , leading in itself to misrule and excess , is tempered with an awful gravity . All your sophisters can not produce anything better adapted to preserve a manly freedom than the course that we have pursued , who have chosen our nature rather than our speculations for the great conservatories and magazines of our rights and privileges . @# II .  --  A Lost Opportunity You might , if you pleased , have profited of our example , and have given to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some parts the walls , and , in all , the foundations , of a noble and venerable castle . You might have repaired those walls , you might have built on those old foundations . But you began ill , because you began by despising everything that belonged to you . Respecting your forefathers , you would have been taught to respect yourselves . By following wise examples you would have shamed despotism from the earth by showing that freedom is not only reconcilable , but auxiliary to law . You would have had a free constitution . You would have had a protected , satisfied , laborious , and obedient people , taught to seek the happiness that is to be found by virtue in all conditions ; in which consists the true moral equality of mankind , and not in that monstrous fiction which , by inspiring false ideas and vain expectations into men destined to travel in the obscure walk of laborious life , serves only to aggravate and embitter that real inequality which it never can remove , and which the order of civil life establishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave in an humble state as those whom it is able to exalt to a condition more splendid but not more happy . Compute your gains ; see what is got by those extravagant and presumptuous speculations which have taught your leaders to despise all their predecessors and all their contemporaries , and even to despise themselves , until the moment in which they became truly despicable . By following those false lights , France has bought undisguised calamities at a higher price than any nation has purchased the most unequivocal blessings . She has abandoned her interest that she might prostitute her virtue . All other nations have begun the fabric of a new government , or the reformation of an old , by establishing , or by enforcing with greater exactness , some rites or other of religion . All other people have laid the foundations of civil freedom in severer manners , and a system of a more austere and masculine morality . France , when she let loose the reins of regal authority , doubled the license of a ferocious dissoluteness in manners , and of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through all ranks of life , as if she were communicating some privilege , or laying open some secluded benefit , all the unhappy corruptions that usually were the disease of wealth and power . This is one of the new principles of equality in France . France , by the perfidy of her leaders , has utterly disgraced the tone of lenient counsel in the cabinets of princes , and has taught kings to tremble at what will hereafter be called the delusive plausibilities of moral politicians . Sovereigns will consider those who advise them to place an unlimited confidence in their people as subverters of their thrones . This alone is an irreparable calamity to you and to mankind . The French have rebelled against a mild and lawful monarch with more fury , outrage , and insult than ever any people has been known to rise against the most illegal usurper or the most sanguinary tyrant . Their resistance was made to concession ; their revolt was from protection ; their blow was aimed at a hand holding out graces , favours , and immunities . They have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tribunals subverted ; industry without vigour ; commerce expiring ; the revenue unpaid , yet the people impoverished ; a Church pillaged and a state unrelieved ; everything human and divine sacrificed to the idol of public credit , and national bankruptcy the consequence . @# III .  --  The Men in Power This unforced choice , this fond election of evil , would appear perfectly unaccountable if we did not consider the composition of the national assembly . If we were to know nothing of this assembly but its title and function , no colours could paint to the imagination anything more venerable . But no artificial institution whatever can make the men of whom any system of authority is composed any other than God , and nature , and education , and their habits of life have made them . Capacities beyond these the people have not to give . Virtue and wisdom may be the objects of their choice ; but their choice confers neither the one nor the other on those upon whom they lay their ordaining hands . They have not the engagement of nature , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such powers . Judge , sir , of my surprise when I found that a very great proportion of the assembly was composed of practitioners in the law . It was composed , not of distinguished magistrates , not of leading advocates , not of renowned professors ; the general composition was of obscure provincial advocates , of stewards of petty local jurisdictions , country attorneys , notaries , and the whole train of the ministers of municipal litigation , the fomenters and conductors of the petty war of village vexation . From the moment I read the list I saw distinctly , and very nearly as it happened , all that was to follow . Who could but conceive that men who are habitually meddling , daring , subtle , active , of litigious dispositions and unquiet minds , would easily fall back into their old condition of low and unprofitable chicane ? Who could doubt but that , at any expense to the state , of which they understood nothing , they must pursue their private interests , which they understood but too well ? It was inevitable ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolutions have been conducted by persons who , whilst they attempted changes in the commonwealth , sanctified their ambition by advancing the dignity of the people whose peace they troubled . Such was our Cromwell , one of the great bad men of the old stamp . Such were your whole race of Guises , Condes , Colignys , and Richelieus . These men , among all their massacres , did not slay the mind in their country . A conscious dignity , a noble pride , a generous sense of glory and emulation , was not extinguished . But your present confusion , like a palsy , has attacked the fountain of life itself . Every person in your country in a situation to be actuated by principles of honour is disgraced and degraded . Property is destroyed , and rational liberty has no existence . If this be your actual situation , as compared to the situation to which you were called , as it were by the voice of God and man , I can not find it in my heart to congratulate you on the choice you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endeavours . Far am I from denying in theory , full as far as my heart from withholding in practice , the real rights of man . Government is not made in virtue of natural rights , which may and do exist in total independence of it , and exist in much greater clearness , and in a much greater degree of abstract perfection ; but their abstract perfection is their practical defect . Government is a contrivance of human wisdom to provide for human wants . Men have a right that these wants should be provided for by this wisdom . Among these wants is to be reckoned the want , out of civil society , of a sufficient restraint upon their passions . In this sense the restraints on men , as well as their liberties , are to be reckoned among their rights . But as the liberties and the restrictions vary with times and circumstances , and admit of infinite modifications , they can not be settled upon any abstract rule ; and nothing is so foolish as to discuss them upon that principle . The moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each to govern himself , and suffer any artificial , positive limitation upon those rights , from that moment the whole organisation of government becomes a consideration of convenience . This it is which makes the constitution of a state , and the due distribution of powers , a matter of the most delicate and complicated skill . When I hear the simplicity of contrivance aimed at and boasted of in any new political constitutions , I am at no loss to decide that the artificers are grossly ignorant of their trade , or negligent of their duty . The pretended rights of these theorists are all extremes , and in proportion as they are metaphysically true they are morally and politically false . The rights of men are in a sort of middle , incapable of definition , but not impossible to be discerned . But this sort of people are so taken up with their theories about the rights of man that they have totally forgotten his nature . Without opening one new avenue to the understanding , they have stopped up those that lead to the heart . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the National Assembly , a majority , sometimes real , sometimes pretended , captive itself , compels a captive king to issue as royal edicts , at third hand , the polluted nonsense of their most licentious and giddy coffee-houses . It is notorious that all their measures are decided before they are debated . Amidst assassination , massacre , and confiscation , perpetrated or meditated , they are forming plans for the good order of future society . Who is it that admires , and from the heart is attached to , national representative assemblies , but must turn with horror and disgust from such a profane burlesque and abominable perversion of that sacred institute ? Miserable king , miserable assembly ! History , who exercises her awful censure over the proceedings of all sorts of sovereigns , will not forget how the king , and his queen , and their infant children , who once would have been the pride and hope of a great and generous people , were forced to abandon the sanctuary of the most splendid palace in the world , which they left polluted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to taste , drop by drop , more than the bitterness of death . Is this a triumph to be consecrated at altars ? I rejoice to hear that the great lady , an object of that triumph , has borne that day  --  one is interested that beings made for suffering should suffer well  --  and that she bears the whole weight of her accumulated wrongs with a serene patience , in a manner suited to her rank and race ; that she feels with the dignity of a Roman matron ; that in the last extremity she will save herself from the last disgrace ; and that , if she must fall , she will fall by no ignoble hand . It is now sixteen years since I saw the Queen of France , then the dauphiness , at Versailles , and surely never lighted on this orb a more delightful vision . I saw her glittering like the morning star , full of life , and splendour , and joy . Oh ! what a revolution ! Little did I dream that I should have lived to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , in a nation of men of honour , and of cavaliers . I thought ten thousand swords must have leaped from their scabbards to avenge even a look that threatened her with insult . But the age of chivalry is gone . That of sophisters , economists , and calculators has succeeded ; and the glory of Europe is extinguished for ever . Never , never more shall we behold that generous loyalty to rank and sex , that proud submission , that dignified obedience , that subordination of the heart , which kept alive , even in servitude itself , the spirit of an exalted freedom . It is gone , that sensibility of principle , that chastity of honour , which felt a stain like a wound , which inspired courage whilst it mitigated ferocity , which ennobled whatever it touched , and under which vice itself lost half its evil by losing all its grossness . If the king and queen of France and their children were to fall into our hands by the chance of war , they would be treated with another sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ king of France in that situation ; you have read how he was received in England . Four hundred years have gone over us ; but I believe we are not materially changed since that period . We have not lost the generosity and dignity of thinking of the fourteenth century ; nor as yet have we subtilised ourselves into savages . We have not been drawn and trussed , in order that we may be filled , like stuffed birds in a museum , with chaff and rags and paltry blurred shreds of paper about the rights of man . We have real hearts of flesh and blood beating in our bosoms . We fear God ; we look up with awe to kings , with affection to parliaments , with duty to magistrates , with reverence to priests , and with respect to nobility . Why ? Because when such ideas are brought before our minds it is natural to be so affected ; because all other feelings are false and spurious , and tend to corrupt our minds , to vitiate our primary morals , to render us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ servile insolence , to be our low sport for a few holidays , to make us perfectly fit for , and justly deserving of , slavery through the whole course of our lives . @# V.  --  Principles of Statesmanship One of the first principles on which the commonwealth and the laws are consecrated is lest the temporary possessors and life-renters in it should act as it they were the entire masters , hazarding to leave to those who come after them a ruin instead of an habitation . By this unprincipled facility of changing the state as often , and in as many ways as there are floating fancies or fashions , the whole continuity of the commonwealth would be broken . Men would become little better than the flies in summer . First of all , the science of jurisprudence , the pride of the human intellect , which , with all its defects , redundances , and errors , is the collected reason of ages , combining the principles of original justice with the infinite variety of human concerns , would be no longer studied . No certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would keep the actions of men in a certain course . No principles would be early worked into the habits . Who would ensure a tender and delicate sense of honour , to beat almost with the first pulses of the heart , when no man could know what would be the test of honour in a nation continually varying the standard of its coin ? To avoid , therefore , the evils of inconstancy and versatility , ten thousand times worse than those of obstinacy and the blindest prejudice , we have consecrated the state , that no man should approach to look into its defects or corruptions but with due caution ; that he should never dream of beginning its reformation by its subversion ; that he should approach to the faults of the state as to the wounds of a father , with pious awe and trembling solicitude . Society is indeed a contract . But it is not a partnership in things subservient only to the gross animal existence of a temporary and perishable nature . It is a partnership in all science ; a partnership in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all perfection . As the ends of such a partnership can not be obtained in many generations , it becomes a partnership not only between those who are living , but between those who are living , those who are dead , and those who are to be born . Each contract of each particular state is but a clause in the great primeval contract of eternal society , linking the lower with the higher natures , connecting the visible and invisible world , according to a fixed compact sanctioned by the inviolable oath which holds all physical and all moral natures , each in their appointed place . These , my dear sir , are , were , and , I think , long will be , the sentiments of not the least learned and reflecting part of this kingdom . They conceive that He Who gave our nature to be perfected by our virtue willed also the necessary means of its perfection . He willed , therefore , the state  --  He willed its connection with the source and original archetype of all perfection . They who are convinced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the sovereign of sovereigns , can not think it reprehensible that this , our corporate realty and homage , that this our recognition of a signiory paramount  --  I had almost said this oblation of the state itself  --  as a worthy offering on the high altar of universal praise , should be performed with modest splendour and unassuming state . For those purposes they think some part of the wealth of the country is as usefully employed as it can be in fomenting the luxury of individuals . It is on some such principles that the majority of the people of England , far from thinking a religious national establishment unlawful , hardly think it lawful to be without one . The commons of Great Britain , in the national emergencies , will never seek their resource from the confiscation of the estates of the church and poor . Sacrilege and proscription are not among the ways and means of our committee of supply . There is not one public man in this kingdom , of any party or description , who does not reprobate the dishonest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been compelled to make of that property which it was their first duty to protect . But to what end should we discuss all these things ? How shall we discuss the limitations of royal power ? Your king is in prison . Why speculate on the measure and standard of liberty ? I doubt very much indeed whether France is at all ripe for liberty on any standard . Society can not exist unless a controlling power upon will and appetite be placed somewhere , and the less of it there is within , the more there must be without . It is ordained in the eternal constitution of things that men of intemperate minds can not be free . Their passions forge their fetters. @# @# AUGUSTE COMTE A Course of Positive Philosophy Isidore Auguste Marie Francois Xavier Comte , the founder of the Positive philosophy , was born at Montpellier , in France , Jan. 19 , 1798 . Entering the Ecole Polytechnique at Paris in his seventeenth year , he showed mathematical talent , but was expelled for insubordination . In 1818 he met St. Simon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that philosopher ; but in 1824 he broke away and entered on an independent philosophical career . In 1826 he expounded to a distinguished audience his system of Positive philosophy , but during the course had an attack of insanity which lasted for a few months . Between 1830 and 1842 he published his " Cours de Philosophie Positive . " From 1835 to 1845 he acted as examiner at the Ecole Polytechnique , but after 1845 he was supported by a " subsidy " from his admirers . Comte married in 1825 , but his marriage was not happy , and ended in a separation in 1842 . He died on September 5 , 1857 . His other important works are " The System of Positive Politics " and the " Positivist Catechism . " @# I.  --  Positive Classification of the Sciences On studying the development of human intelligence , it is found that it passes through three stages : ( 1 ) The theological , ( 2 ) the metaphysical , ( 3 ) the scientific or positive . In the theological stage it seeks to account for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seeks an explanation in abstract forces . In the scientific , or positive , stage it applies itself to the study of the relation of phenomena to each other . Different sciences have passed through these stages at different rates . Astronomy reached the positive stage first , then terrestrial physics , then chemistry , then physiology , while sociology has not even yet reached it . To put social phenomena upon a positive basis is the main object of this work ; its secondary object is to show that all branches of knowledge spring from the same trunk . An integration of the sciences on a positive basis should lead to the discovery of the laws which rule the intellect in the investigation of facts , should regenerate science and reorganise society . At present the theological , the metaphysical , and the positive conflict , and cause intellectual disorder and confusion . The first step to be taken in forming a positive philosophy is to classify the sciences . The first great division we notice in natural phenomena is the division into inorganic and organic phenomena . Under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , chemistry ; and under the organic we include the sciences physiology and sociology . These five sciences , astronomy , physics , chemistry , physiology , and sociology , we may consider the five fundamental sciences . This classification follows the order of the development of the sciences , and indicates their social relation and relative perfection . In order to reach effective knowledge , the sciences must be studied in the order named ; sociology can not be understood without knowledge of the anterior sciences . Behind and before all these sciences , however , lies the great science of mathematics  --  the most powerful instrument the mind can employ in the investigation of natural law  --  and the science of mathematics must be divided into abstract mathematics or the calculus , and concrete mathematics embracing general geometry and rational mechanics . We have thus really six great sciences . MATHEMATICS . Mathematics may be defined briefly as the indirect measurement of magnitudes and the determination of magnitudes by each other . It is the business of concrete mathematics to discover the equations of phenomena ; it is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus concrete mathematics discovers by actual experiment the acceleration which takes place per second in a falling body , and abstract mathematics educes results from the equations so discovered , and obtains unknown quantities from known . ASTRONOMY . Astronomy may be defined as the science by which we discover the laws of the geometrical and mechanical phenomena presented by heavenly bodies . To discover these laws we can use only our sense of sight and our reasoning power , and reasoning bears a greater proportion to observation here than in any other science . Sight alone would never teach us the figure of the earth or the path of a planet , and only by the measurement of angles and computation of times can we discover astronomical laws . The observation of these invariable laws frees man from servitude to the theological and metaphysical conceptions of the universe . PHYSICS . Physics may be defined briefly as the study of the laws which regulate the general properties of bodies regarded en masse , their molecules remaining unaltered and usually in a state of aggregation . In the observations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and experiment assist observation . In the phenomena of astronomy human intervention was impossible ; in the phenomena of physics man begins to modify natural phenomena . Physics includes the subdivisions statics , dynamics , thermology , acoustics , optics , and electrology . Physics is still handicapped by metaphysical conceptions of the primary causes of phenomena . CHEMISTRY . Chemistry may be briefly defined as the study of the laws of the phenomena of composition and decomposition , which result from the molecular and specific mutual action of different substances , natural or artificial . In the observations of chemistry the senses are still more employed , and experiment is of still more utility . Even in chemistry metaphysical conceptions , such as " affinity , " linger . PHYSIOLOGY . Physiology may be defined as the study of the laws of organic dynamics in relation to structure and environment . Placed in a given environment , a definite organism must always act in a definite way , and physiology investigates the reciprocal relations between organism , environment , and function . In physiology observation and experiment are of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to assist both observation and experiment .
