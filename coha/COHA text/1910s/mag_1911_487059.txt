It is not that the artist lacks manual dexterity , but his painting is , apparently , a feeble imitation of the Japanese . Surely , Europe should be pictured for Europeans by artists whole-heartedly of European tradition . We should have supposed that Mr. Hutton was valuable enough to his publishers to enable him to have a voice in the choice of illustrations for his books . Until he asserts himself , the only salvation for his . readers seems to lie in tearing out the colored illustrations and having the volume rebound without them . 1 otos The Putnams have in the press a student 's edition of John P Mahaffy 's " What Have the Greeks Done for Modern Civilization ?

R Tutin 's edition of his lyrics , issued so late as 1903 . The biographical sketch in the first chapter of the monograph is expanded to sixty-odd pages by plentiful interlarding of already known facts with copious conjecture . Some interesting suggestions are offered concerning similarities between Cotton and French poets , chiefly Malherbe , de Viaud , and Racan , which may be of use to some future student ambitious of a doctor 's hood , in his researches into the influence of French poetry on the English lyric in the seventeenth century . The present study will hardly draw this forgotten singer from the obscurity that has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walter Runciman  --  not the Asquith cabinet minister , but his father  --  followed the sea in his youth and heard so often from old English sailors that " Boney was a d  --  d good fellow after all " that from his earliest years he became interested in the great Corsican . As his reading widened , his fervor increased , until at last , like the Psalmist , when musing on the wickedness of man . his heart was hot within him and he spake with his tongue . Hence the " Tragedy of St. Helena " ( Stokes ) . It traverses much the same ground as Lord Rosebery 's excellent volume , but with less insight and more vehemence . As the author contemplates " the atrocious crime of Napoleon 's captivity , " the enormities of Sir Hudson Lowe , " a monomaniac , pure and simple , " and the odious incapacity of the Tory Government , he can only exclaim ( p. 178 ) , " What a gang of puffy , mildewed creatures were at the head of British affairs in those days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the author devotes a chapter to Josephine , in omparison with whom Bonaparte is. purity itself .

" To him all the St. Helena statements , so far as they are favorable to Napoleon , are trustworthy . He rejects the conclusions of recent critical scholars ? " skeptics woo were not only not there to witness all that went on , but some of whom were not born for many years after Napoleon and his contemporaries had passed on . " Sir Walter wishes to praise Napoleon ; unconsciously he has paid him the greatest tribute possible : he has believed everything that the great exile at St. Helena cleverly tried to make posterity believe . " Behind Turkish Lattices " ( Lippincott ) , by Hester Donaldson Jenkins , is a simple ' but pleasant little book of sketches . It covers such phases as babyhood , school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupations , religious observances , and , based as it is upon nine years of intimacy with Constantinople , it can really be trusted , at least for the things which Miss Jenkins has observed for herself . But unfortunately the observer in the East almost always goes on to ask questions , and takes the information then received as correct . That is a vain imagination ; even among ourselves we do not ' look to the man in the street for sound opinionS in theology or law . He would , probably , so confronted , say impatiently that he did not know , or derisively refer us to an encyclopwdia . But the Oriental , most unhappily , always knows , and so the great ball of travellers ' misinformation rolls up . In truth , gray hairs are no hindrance to prayer ; the jinn , for Moslems , are far from non-existent  --  that is , not the obstacle to marriage with them ; the Ottoman Sultan has not had fully legal wives for centuries ; a woman may not marry immediately after divorce ; making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , etc . Miss Jenkins should read for herself some Turkish texts on these subjects . She knows too much not to know a great deal more . There are twenty-four very good pictures " Social France in the XVII Century " ( Macmillan ) was apparently written as a thesis in fulfilment of the requirements of a higher degree , and it bears all the earmarks of a painstaking academic performance . The author , Miss Cecile Hugon , " Sometime Scholar of Somerville College , Oxford , " offers a fairly comprehensive survey of the period in question , but she gives little that is novel in the way of facts or of their interpretation , although her avowed purpose is to combat the idea of a perfect unity , both social and intellectual , in the France of this seventeenth century . Nor is her acquaintance with first-hand authorities as complete as it should be . In dealing with country conditions and with the anarchy that ruled in certain of the provinces , the writer makes no mention of Flechier 's most valuable book , " Les Grands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and religious life of the time , she seems not to know a writer so significant as Saint7Evremont . As to the arts other than literature and the theatre , she devotes a few paragraphs to painting andengraving , but says nothing of music , although the seventeenth century was the age of Rameau , - Lulli , and of COuperin , whose star is now so much in the ascendant in Paris . In short , Miss Hugon 's book gives little of significance that the reader of French literature could not extract as well from the better-known plays , letters , poetry , and memoirs of the period , or from standard studies on special phases of her subject . A word of praise should be said for the illustrations which are all made from contemporary . paintings and engravings , the latter including a number of Abraham Bosse 's delightful representations of the life of the Parisian bourgeoisie .

It is fair to say that the impression produced by his book is such that the reader is inclined to believe Mr. Will . His experience in newspaper work has given him a saving sense of proportion and a true instinct for actuality . His book is pleasant reading , and sets before us a very human and likeable personality . It has been the good fortune of Cardinal Gibbons to enjoy through his long life as primate of the American hierarchy not merely the respect , but also the genuine good-will of his non-Catholic fellow-citizens . And in running through Mr. Will 's pages the reason is easily seen . An all-embracing charity and tolerance for persons , a clear-sighted , uncompromising tenacity in purpose and principle , together with an utterly modern  --  perhaps one might say American  --  frankness and directness of speech and action , are qualities which appeal strongly to the ordinary man ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first . If one were limited to a single adjective which should distinctively characterize his influence upon men and movements of his time , " eirenic " would come as near the truth as any . Priest at twenty-seven , bishop at thirty-four , arch-bishop at forty-three , cardinal at fifty-two , he has for a generation headed the Roman Catholic Church in America , and has in his lifetime seen its marvellous growth under conditions of a freedom with which he has many times expressed his unqualified sympathy . Many important phases of American Catholic history find place in Mr. Will 's biography , of which the cardinal may truthfully say pars magna fui , as for example the Knights of Labor dispute , " Cahenslyism , " and the controversy over " Americanism . " Not the least valuable quality of Mr. Will 's work is his accurate and authoritative use of original sources in dealing with these matters which were so fiercely debated twenty or thirty years ago . The account of the Conclave in 1903 which elected the present Pope is especially interesting , inasmuch as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the part played by Cardinal Gibbons in overcoming the reluctance of Cardinal Sarto to accept election . These things belong to history , but one is disposed rather to linger upon the many anecdotes in the book which fill in details of person . scenery and of animals are so crude as to be painful . T. W. Rolleston 's " Myths and Legends of the Celtic Race " ( Crowell ) is designed for the general ' reader for whom the heroic saga of the Celts looms vaguely as something one ought to know about . The fact is that few even of the very well-read could tell you offhand the story of Deirdre , the Irish Helen , and her ill-fated love for Naist , or of Cuchulain ( Cuchullin ) , the Irish Achilles , and this in spite of Lady Gregory and Mr. Yeats , whose work in this field Mr. Rolleston does not mention . This vagueness about the Celtic heroes and heroines is due , of course , mainly to the fact that they have lacked a vates sacer . Tennyson 's " Voyage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it was too slight to impress that wonder-voyage on the popular imagination . Another cause for their obscurity is that their names are so hard to pronounce , and even the members of the Gaelic League do not seem to have agreed how they shall be spelled . Guinevere herself , as Gwenhwyvar , which is her real name , could not have become a household word . We are apt to forget what a service the Latins did the Greeks in making us feel at home with their names or something resembling their names . But perhaps the cause lies deeper in the character of the saga itself . It is almost always a fairy saga , teeming with monsters and transformations . One wearies , though the Celts never wearied. , of all this magic and illusion , and like the Greek Odysseus in the society of Calyps. , we long for the normal . Who would linger over the a &; ventures of a hero whose Berserker rage is such that his followers must " plunge him in a vat of cold water which had been made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the staves and hoops of the vat were burst asunder ? " This is the lad Cuchulain . For this reason we do not recommend a consecutive reading of Mr. Rolleston 's exhaustive work . His divisions of the saga and comparison of Gmlic and Cymric legend are clear and interesting . The Irish were never , like the Cymry , romantic or sentimental . Religion and loyalty were their two ruling passions . The Celtic heroines go into battle , and more often than not woo the reluctant heroes . Deirdre is the most womanly of them all , and if she could be put into an opera like Parsifal. she might yet be rescued from comparative oblivion . The heroic traditions do not go very far back . The adventures of Cuchulain are supposed to have taken place about the time of the birth of Christ . The Ossianic Cycle falls in the third century A. D. , and the bardic literature that preserves it is said to have been composed about the ninth or tenth century . Mr. Rolleston provides a useful glossary and index . The illustrations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been omitted . With rare selective skill , Don C. Seitz , the author of " Surface Japan : Short Notes of a Swift Survey " ( Harper ) , has reproduced in full-page color-pictures the common aspects of Japanese life . Bordered pages carry thumbnail sketches from Hokusai , side by side with dainty vistas of flowery fields , tea gardens , rice-ditch irrigation , and toil by day and night . The happy boy with a slice of watermelon , the two kittens on the samisen ( three-stringed banjo ) , the tribulations of the baby that has put his hand in the cold bath , and the look of pity and amusement on the mother 's face are inimitable . The text reveals a witty , whimsical , keen observer , who can appreciate a strange people , even while he prefers his own ; he makes an old subject fresh and piques the interest even of the reader of many books on Japan . " Pins and Pincushions " ( Longmans ) is the title chosen by the authors , E. D. Longman and S. Loch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pin from ancient to modern days . The word itself they try to derive from the Latin spina , a thorn , contrary to the usual opinion that it comes from the Latin penna . It is true , at any rate , that thorns were used for the purpose fiora earliest times , and it is interesting to learn that " quite recently , Gipsy Lee of Aldeburgh , in Suffolk ( aged nearly a hundred years ) , wrote to her great-niece , living near Southwold , in the same county , asking her to send her some pin-thorns , as they were not procurable in her own neighborhood . " Hairpins were not always bipeds , but became so , the authors think , when the fashion arose of " wearing the hair in curls close to the head . " " In 1047 , 12,000 pins were delivered from the royal wardrobe for one of the French princesses . " About 1600 , English pinmakers sent a petition to Lord Burghley asking for protection , since the cheaper varieties from abroad were throwing their men out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1,000 white pins cost 8d. , or about 75 cents . A chapter or so is given to the importance of pins in magic and witchcraft . A piece of bacon stuck full of pins was sometimes hung in the chimney to keep off witches , and the custom still persists in certain parts of England of trying to get revenge upon a person by sticking a waxen manikin with pins ; earlier the same purpose was aimed at by using a poor toad . One of the ways to prove that a woman was not a witch was to prick her , in the hope that she might.feel it  --  a Method , be it said , that gave her greater chance of escape than the practice of throwing her into a pond and concluding that if she sank she was human , but if she floated she was the devil 's own . A book to prize is " Some Old Flemish Towns " ( Moffat , Yard ; $4 net ) , written and pictured by George Wharton Edwards . Coats-of-arms of the various cities , reproduced in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artistic gilt lettering , make the cover itself a treasure . For some reason travellers are wont to pay less heed to Belgium than to Holland , feeling perhaps that it is neither one thing nor the other . Lying between the frontiers of Holland and France , it is often taken to be merely a mixture of French vivacity and Dutch picturesqueness . Mr. Edwards soon dispels such suspicions and reveals below the modern veneer of industrialism the ruggedness of the older civilization . As an artist who spent his student days there , Mr. Edwards knows the choice out-of-the-way bits and has the pride in their antiquity which is found to-day in the heart of every peasant . Fortresses and castles still stand that go back to before the ninth century , and popularly the towns retain their individualities . Dwellers for any length of time in that land will recall the song which reminds Ghent of its past glories and whichthe people sing lustily .

In " English Country Life " ( McClurg ) Walter Raymond tells how he settled down in a little village of Sutton to enjoy life and study rural types , and then treats us to a rare collection of anecdotes and character sketches . He is the true Spectator ; but of the village tavern , instead of the London coffee house . He loves and understands nature without being sentimental about it , and he can sketch a vagabond with a touch of George Borrow 's strange whimsicality . And there is over all an atmosphere of country freshness . The charm of the author 's work is enhanced by the admirable printing and binding of the book , which ccoontra.ins also some tasteful illustrations in lo As a rule , books of travel are interesting and novel in proportion as the author devotes himself to describing people and events , rather than landscapes , buildings , and the stock " sights " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Borrow 's charm , and Harry A. Franck , in " Four Months Afootin Spain " ( Century ) , has caught the manner of his predecessor . Only Borrow 's religious cant is lacking , an omission which few will regret . For the rest . the formula is much the same . In his pages throng the muleteer , the torero , the hedge-priest , the blind beggar with his Lazarillo , and many another picaresque vagabond with whom he hobnobs with the freemasonry of the road . All these converse entertainingly and sometimes profoundly . They unwittingly lay bare the strength and the weakness of Spain . Those who have read " A Vagabond Journey Around the World " know with what resourcefulness the author solves his financial problems . To one who had earned his way through the Orient it was comparatively easy to spend four months in Spain on $172 . It was merely a matter of denying ' himself luxuries which , for a traveller of Mr. Franck 's stamp , would have deprived travel of all romance . Once on the way , neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not even Kipling has better than he expressed the philosophy of the true " tramp royal " : The joy of travel is not in arriving , but in setting forth , in moving onward ; how fast matters little , where , even less , but ever on and on , forgetting , for the supremest satisfaction , that there is a goal to attain . Let a man wander away into unknown lands smiling with summer , his journey 's end little more than conjecture , his day of arrival a matter of indifference , and if he feel not then the joy of the open road he may know for a certainty that he is a hug-the-hearth , and no gypsy and a vagabond . In this happy-go-lucky spirit Mr. Franck traversed the provinces of Andalusia , Castile , Leon , the Asturias , the Basque country , Aragon , and Navarra , missing little worth the seeing . One thousand miles were covered afoot , as many more by train . The book , contains ample evidence that its author is not always a vagabond , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thoughtful student . But on the whole it is plain that he better appreciates the art of the torero than that of the painter . Mr. Franck 's style , if a bit too slangy , is- vivid and picturesque . The accompanying illustrations are as unhackneyed as the text . The death is reported from Paris , in his fifty-seventh year , of Maurice Montegut , who as a youth gave promise of literary power Before he was of age he had published two volumes ? of verse , ? " La Bo-hems sentimentale " and " Les Romans tragiques " ? and a dramatic poem , " Lady Tempest . " Since then he has written voluminously in most of the known types of literature . Science The Putnams , as agents of the Cambridge University Press , announce " Mathematical and Physical Papers , " Volume VI , by Sir William Thomson , arranged and revised by Sir Joseph Larmor , Volume VI is devoted to voltaic theory , ' radioactivity , electrons , navigation , and tides . According to a paper published recently by Marcel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Seine-etMarne , the ills of neolithic man were much what human ills are to-day .

As might be suspected , the dental caries were only one-tenth as frequent as to-day The stockman 's side of the dairy problem is well presented in " Dairy Cattle and Milk Production , " by C. H. Eckles ( Macmillan ) The questions it discusses are as yet , over any given area , even near our cities , very imperfectly understood by the majority of farmers , but the book goes far to throw light on such subjects as the choice of breeds , the building up of a herd , the management of the cattle , and economic feeding . The tone of the book is scientific throughout , while at the same time its advice can be followed by any farmer with a little education and an intention to improve conditions .

P Olivier publishes his studies of 175 parabolic orbits of meteors , a paper presented to the faculty of the University of Virginia for the degree of doctor of philosophy . The first observations were made in 1898 , and above 6,000 are recorded , of which about one-third were made at the Lick Observatory . His results are painstaking and the summary announces proof of intimate connection between Halley 's Comet and the Eta Aquarids . Stationary radiants appear to be rare , if they exist at all , and the change in position of the Perseid radiant from day to day is fully confirmed . He finds that the Orionids do not seem to have a stationary radiant , and that of the Leonids shows no appreciable change of pesition from day , to day . Negative evidence seems to indicate that the existence of the so-called Alpha-Beta Perseids , except in August , is unconfirmed .

" Principles and Design of Aeroplanes " - ( Van Nostrand ) , by Herbert Chaney , is a pocket edition which gives the fundamental principles of the aeroplane in very simple language , and is useful for those who desire to know something about aviation without too serious study . The various parts of the aeroplane are shown and explained by diagrams and are discussed in short chapters ; the chief fault lies in the fact that the information is almost too brief Little books of this type should be encouraged in this country ; in Europe they are far more common . There are doubtless many who would like to carry the information such a volume imparts to aviation meets or when travelling In a recent Monthly Weather Review , George W. Mindling and Andrew H. Palmer treat the question of artificial heating in its effect upon the climate of cities Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bolton , president of the American Society of Heating and Ventilating Engineers , as to possible modification of weather conditions by the enormous fuel consumption in New York city . His contention is that the rapidly increasing consumption of fuel has reduced the number of days with a temperature at zero or below , and has increased the number of cloudless days . He also thinks it has lessened precipitation , particularly in winter months , as well as relative humidity of the air  --  the latter about seven per cent . Mr. Bolton 's computations show that the amount of heat artificially produced in the city is sufficient to raise the temperature of the air nearly five degrees , Fahrenheit , a mile above the whole city-326 square miles Mr. Mindling examines each of these statements in detail , and concludes that it is not the heat produced within buildings which is chiefly accountable for the higher temperatures in the heart of cities . The materials used in walls and pavements are contributory causes , as are differences in drainage and surface character . Natural movements of the air are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solar energy from walls counts for much in sheltered spaces Many other proofs are adduced ; and careful tables are compiled to show that conditions in villages and small cities follow much the same variation as New York with its far greater consumption of fuel Mr. PaImer finds that half a century ago Luke Howard , an early observer , wrote that the temperature of London must not be taken for that of the climate , partaking as it does of artificial warmth , " induced by its structure , by a crowded population and the consumption of great quantities of fuel in fires " He quotes startling statements from Eaton and others , as to the amount of heat liberated in the city , and its effect in raising temperatures of the free air . To challenge these remarks , Mr. Palmer has made careful studies of weather reports , particularly at Blue Hill , in order to find , if possible , any change in the climate of Boston , artificially produced . Such he fails to discover , and data from the archives of the Paris Observatory fail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fuel burned . Negative results are reached also in the matter of precipitation . And his conclusion is virtually the same as Mr. Mindling 's , that , " judging tram the evidence available , the heat generated by great cities is not changing their climates in any appreciable degree . " Under the comprehensive title , " Birds in Literature " ( Worcester , Mass : The Davis Publishing Co . ) , Miss Abby P. Churchill presents short quotations from many of our best-known nature writers concerning some hundred species of American birds . The arrangement is alphabetical with reference to the birds ' for example , the list is headed with the American bittern , with a quotation from Torrey . Next comes the crow blackbird , about whose habits and voice we find pertinent paragraphs by Merriam , Parkhurst , Burroughs , Nuttall , Miller , Emerson , and Lowell .
