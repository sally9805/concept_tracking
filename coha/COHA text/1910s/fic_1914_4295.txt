XIII THE HAPPY ENDING THE HOUSE OF TOYS CHAPTER I THE PLANS This is not a fairy tale , although you will find some old friends here . There is , for example , a witch , a horrid old creature who tricks the best and wisest of us : Circumstance is one of her many names , and a horde of grisly goblins follow in her train . For crabbed beldame an aunt , who meant well but was rich and used to having her own way , will do fairly well . Good fairies there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself which one is the best . But the tale has chiefly to do with a youth to whom the witch had made one gift , well knowing that one would not be enough . Together with a girl  --  a sunflower who did not thrive in the shade , as Jim Blaisdell has said  --  he undertook to build , among other things , a house of love wherein she should dwell and reign . But when it was built he met another girl , who was  --  say , an iris . There are white irises , and very beautiful flowers they are . From her  --  But that is the story . He was , then , tall , as well favored as is good for a young man , with straight-gazing though at times rather dreamy gray-green eyes , kinky brown hair and a frank friendly manner that was very engaging . Since his tenth year he had been alone in the world , with a guardian trust company for sole relative . But he tried to make up for that by having many friends . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , which was much to his credit . Those near his own age often made him a confidant in such matters as their ambitions and loves . His elders saw to it that he was asked not only to the things their wives and sisters gave but to week-ends in the family bosom as well . And women liked him , which was not so much to his credit , since we judge our own sex far more wisely than the other . Old ladies praised his manners and visited his rooms , taking an active interest in his intimate wardrobe . Younger women flirted with him ad libitum and used him unconscionably , sure that he would take no advantage . Girls of sixteen or thereabouts secretly held him in awe and spun romances around him . In return he gave them all a sort of reverence , thinking them superfine creatures who could do no meanness or wrong . He envied his men friends who had mothers or sisters or wives to be served ; in the life of a young man alone in the world there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a dream over which he used to burn much tobacco : of a day when he should not be alone . He awaited impatiently the coming of that splendid day . Therefore he dabbled recklessly in the tender passion . About twice a year on an average he fell experimentally in love . It made him very sad that after a brief captivity his heart was always set free . Moreover , there was something about him that made his friends , men as well as women , say to one another , " Some of these days that Davy Quentin is going to do big things . " You have known young men like that ; as often as not they continue through life a promise unfulfilled . In David 's case the faith survived stubbornly on scanty nourishment . He had been left a little patrimony sufficient to carry him beyond college , where he smoked the usual number of cigarettes , drank a limited quantity of beer and managed to pass his examinations respectably though not even cum laude . After that he studied architecture , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , especially the ecclesiastical branch . And it happened that soon after he hung out his shingle he won a prize offered by a magazine for plans for a three-thousand-dollar bungalow . This , when they heard of it , fortified the faith of his friends , who carelessly supposed the prize to have been much bigger than it was and a brilliant career thus to have been safely launched . Oddly enough , however , it never occurred to them to lend a hand at the launching . They took its success for granted and saved their help and their business for young men , such as the energetic but otherwise untalented Dick Holden , of whom less was expected . It is so hard to make friends understand that even a brilliant career needs support at first . It was not wholly their fault ; a very creditable pride kept David from hinting that he was in need of help , which indeed became the fact . The little patrimony had dwindled to a cipher . Clients were few and commissions small . But David , less from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of prosperity . He had the trick of wearing clothes well , lived in nice rooms , played golf at the country club and was always his jolly , cheerful self . His good cheer was not a pretense , for he was never made to feel a pinch . This was a misfortune and the blame must be laid to his own engaging qualities . He found that he could borrow as easily as , when in funds , he had lent . Even Jim Blaisdell who , in his cashier 's office , was held a skinflint and a keen judge of men , was cordiality itself when David went to him with a note for discount . " Gladly , " he said . " But you 'll have to have an indorser , you know . " " I did n't know , " laughed David . " You see , I never tried this before . Am I an innocent ? " " It 'll be all right , though , " Blaisdell answered . " I 'll indorse for you . " Something made David @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be able to meet it promptly . " " Then we 'll carry you . Your face is collateral enough for me . Beat it now  --  I 'm busy . And come out for dinner to-night , Davy . " Sometimes David would feel a qualm of discomfort as he found himself gradually getting behind and sometimes he would wonder , a little sensitively , at the slowness of recognition . But such moments were brief . Unconsciously he had imbibed his friends ' vague confidence in his future . Some day he would win a big commission which , brilliantly executed , would make him forever secure . In the meantime , because he was an honest workman , he gave to his few clients the best he had , a really fine best , worthy of wider notice . And because he grew daily more in love with his art and proposed to be found ready when his great chance came , he put in his spare hours studying hard , making sketches  --  he had a pretty knack for that and might have become a third-rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of tobacco clouds or down from a moonlit sky or across a music-filled room . Sometimes he would tear the sketches to bits . But sometimes , lingering lovingly over one , he would know a deep thrill . " Why , this , " he would exclaim , " this is good . Oh ! " hugging himself , " they 'll have to come to me yet . " On the strength of this conclusion he would allow himself some special extravagance . When he was twenty-seven he was making about nine hundred a year , spending it all as it came , and owed more than five hundred dollars . Then he met Shirley Lord . It was at a dinner given by the Jim Blaisdells , whose guest she was . Mrs. Jim introduced them . " Shirley dear , this is our Davy Quentin . As a special favor  --  to each of you  --  I 'm putting you together to-night . You have just a minute now to get acquainted . " And Mrs. Jim fluttered away . David spent most of that minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he was pleased with his sketches  --  into a pair of blue eyes that smiled at him out of the prettiest , sweetest , kindest face he thought he had ever seen . he always inspired . Framing the face was a lot of wavy brown hair with golden lights dancing in it , her neck and shoulders were slender but softly rounded , the figure hinted at by the soft clinging gown was trim and girlish . But those were details that he drank in later . He heaved a sigh , so patently one of content with his lot that she laughed outright . To laugh well is a gift from the gods . " You 're not a bit as I thought you would be . " " How did you think I should be ? " stammered David , trying to grasp the fact that this dainty creature had been thinking of him at all . " Why , grim and haughty and altogether overwhelming . You know , you 're supposed to be rather wonderful . " David felt anxiously for his head . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to be sure it was still there . I can see it would be easy to lose it . " She laughed again . It is probable that they talked a polite amount with their respective neighbors . But if so , they regarded it as untimely interruption of the real business of the evening . It was amazing the number of things they found to discuss and they discussed them so earnestly and withal , as it seemed to them , so wittily and wisely that they were blissfully unaware of the significant smiles going around the table . When the coffee was served , David surveyed his cup stupidly . " Does it strike you , " he inquired , " that they 've hurried this dinner out of all reason ? " " It has been the usual length , I believe . " " Funny  --  I 've a hazy recollection of fish  --  and of an ice just now  --  but entree and salad and the rest are a total blank . " " Very funny ! " she agreed . " But the queerest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laugh that did not quite reach his eyes . " Yes ? " she queried provocatively , knowing that one of his daring bits was coming . " The queerest of all , " he repeated , " is that you should turn out to be  --  you . " " No queerer than  --  " Then she broke off , with a laugh that did reach her eyes . The next afternoon they played golf . It was at the fifth tee that they abandoned the last pretense of formality . She topped her drive wretchedly ; the ball rolled a scant ten feet . " Oh , David ! " she cried . " Did you ever see anything so awful ? " " Many times , " answered David , who was looking at her , not at the ball . " I 've often wondered , " he mused raptly , " how ' David ' would sound , set to music . " He was rewarded by her rippling , musical laugh . " You say the absurdest things  --  and the nicest . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many zigzags , to an old elm that had upset more than one good game . But they did not swear at it . They sat down under its generous shade , David lighted a cigarette and they gave themselves to a more agreeable exercise . They pretended to define it . " I suppose , " Shirley broke a brief intimate silence , " people think we 're having a violent flirtation . But we 're not , are we ? " " Certainly not , " said David with emphasis . " They could n't understand . We 're just naturally meant to be good friends and it did n't take us an age to find that out . " " Yes , " said David slowly . " Tell me about yourself . " He tried to make it interesting but when he came to the point there was really little to tell . " But that is n't all . You have n't told me why people are so confident of your future . " " I do n't know that . Sometimes I wonder whether they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been very successful , have n't you ? " He shook his head . " I 'm still poor  --  so poor you 'd probably call it indecent  --  with my way to make . It seems a very slow way , too . " There was a hint of disappointment in the quick glance she turned upon him . " Have I lost caste ? " " No . I was just wondering  --  But you 're going to be successful , are n't you ? Everybody ca n't be mistaken in you . Tell me what you want to do . " So he told her of his love for his work , of his studies and sketches , of the beautiful churches that he hoped he should some day build . It was early October ; which is not unimportant . Before them opened a vista of wooded hills , tinted by the first frosts dull yellows and maroons , here and there a flash of rich crimson . A thin haze lay over the land , violet in the distance , about them an almost imperceptible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , subdued and lazy as an echo . Fading hillsides , dying leaves , blue horizons  --  autumn , too , has its wistful charm , as potent as spring to bring young hearts together . " Everybody ca n't be mistaken , " she repeated . " All those things you will do . I feel it , too . It 's something you ca n't explain . You know a man is big , just as you know a woman is good  --  And you could n't lose caste with me . I 'm poor , too . " He swept her with an incredulous glance that took in the beautiful , soft , hand-knit sweater jacket , the white flannel skirt with its air of having been fashioned by an expensive tailor , the white buckskins and bit of white silk stocking . He knew girls , daughters of rich fathers , who did not wear silk stockings for golfing . She caught his glance . " Mostly presents , " she answered it , " from an aunt who has more money than she knows what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's quite true about my poverty . Ever since we were left alone Maizie and I have had to work . We could have gone to live with my aunt , but we wanted to be independent , to make our own living . And we 've made it , though , " laughingly , " we 've been pretty hard up sometimes . So you see , I 'm not a butterfly but just a working girl on her vacation . Have I lost caste ? " Needless question ! As she asked it , her chin  --  her prettiest feature , cleanly molded , curving gently back to the soft throat  --  went up spiritedly . He caught a picture of a struggle far more cruel than her light words implied . A wave of protest swept over him , of tender protectiveness . He had to fight down an impulse to catch her close , to cry out that thenceforth he would assume her burden . He rejoiced intensely that he had found so rare a spirit , fragile yet brave and equal to all the hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of his income and the brevity of their acquaintance and was abashed . The Jim Blaisdells met them at the club for a dinner at which David was host . It was a nicely appointed dinner , the best the chef could contrive . Also it was distinctly an extravagance . But David did not care . His spirits ran high , in a gaiety that was infectious . It was a very successful party . After that came two short hours on the veranda , while a three-quarters moon rose to shower the world with silver , gaiety dwindled and a solemn tender happiness mounted . Then they drove homeward , by a roundabout way , in Jim 's car . David and Shirley had the back seat , for the most part in a free intimate silence that was delicious indeed . Later Mrs. Jim found her guest dreamily braiding her hair for the night . " Shirley , " she began directly , " this is going too fast . David 's too nice a boy to be hurt . He 's taking your flirtation seriously . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least I do n't think I am , " Shirley amended slowly . " I thought you were interested only in rich men ? " " I did think so . But now  --  It might be fun to be poor  --  with him  --  for a while . It would n't be for long . You said yourself he 'll have a brilliant future . " " I think so . But it might be long coming . A professional career is so uncertain at the start . And it 's never fun to be poor  --  unless you 're equipped . Married life is more than parties and golf and dinners at the club . Shirley , dear , " she concluded pleadingly , " do be sensible . " " Of course , I will be . You forget I know all about poverty from experience . " Shirley looked up suddenly , keenly . " Why do you warn me ? Is there any reason why you 're afraid to entrust me to David Quentin ? " " No-o , " said Mrs. Jim . How could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , could she entrust David Quentin to Shirley ? Still later , " Jim , " she said to her almost sleeping husband , " I 'm worried . I 'm afraid David and Shirley will get themselves engaged . " " Wo n't hurt ' em , " grunted Jim . " But they might get married . " " People do it sometimes . Be good for him . Life 's been too easy for Davy . " " I feel responsible . Could n't you speak to Davy and warn him to go slow ? " " I thought , " mumbled Jim , " you were a wise woman , " and dropped off to sleep . At the same late hour David was sitting at the window of his darkened room , smoking pipe after pipe , gazing raptly up at the moon-lit sky . " By George ! " he would breathe ecstatically , " By George ! " as though he had been seeing something wonderful in ecclesiastical architecture . In fact he was planning that wondrous house of love , none the less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before . Every day during Shirley 's two weeks ' visit she and David were together , sometimes , through Mrs. Jim 's contrivance , with others and often , by grace of their own ingenuity , alone , drifting carelessly down the most traveled stream of life . If Mrs. Jim 's warning had awakened any doubts in Shirley 's mind  --  and it had  --  the doubts were quickly laid by David 's presence . She let herself drift ; this in spite of certain very definite and very different plans which she had made for her future . ( In her home city was one Sam Hardy , a money-maker , very attractive , very devoted . ) People saw it and were charmed ; a young woman simply , daringly , unquestioningly yielding to love is a picture from whose wonder neither time nor repetition can subtract . Only to Mrs. Jim did it occur to ponder whether the impulse to surrender sprang from deeps or shallows . And only Dick Holden , who was then David 's chief chum , ventured to hang out a danger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day when he managed to find David alone , " I 'm afraid you 're growing susceptible to women . " " Always was . Any great harm in that ? " " Huh ! If you 'd had sisters , " grunted the ungallant Dick , " you would n't ask that . You do n't know ' em . You think they 're nice , fluffy little angels , do n't you ? Well , they 're not . They  --  they say catty things . And they 've claws in their white , soft little paws , and they 'd rather scratch than eat . And they do n't understand men . " " Whoopee ! " said David . " Do it some more . " " Huh ! You think they 're kind and sympathetic , do n't you ? You think because they look soulfully up at you when you 're gabbling about ecclesiastical architecture they 're taking it all in . Well , they 're not . They 're thinking , ' He has nice eyes  --  too bad he has n't money ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind the scenes . They do n't understand the game of things . They only want a husband for a provider and they soon let him know it . Then he might as well go lie down and die . Take it from me . Few men , " Dick concluded sagely , " survive matrimony . " David laughed uproariously at this counsel . " You blooming old cynic ! You poor old he-Cassandra ! Where did you get all your wisdom ? Just wait until you find some one  --  " " Huh ! I have found her . Or rather she 's found me . I could let her make a fool of me . But I wo n't . A long life and my own life for me . I 'm wearing a sign , ' Nothing doing ! ' You 'd better get one just like it . " David roared again . " All right , laugh ! " growled Dick . " Rope , tie and brand yourself . And then some of these days when you 're one woman 's property and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  That 's another thing , Davy . " But David turned his back on the counselor and fled . What did Dick know about it ? The dream was being realized , the lonely gaps filled . He was to have some one of his own to love and to serve . This time his heart was a captive for life ; any one who had been in love a baker 's dozen of times could tell that . He expected great things of love . He saw it as something exquisitely fine and beautiful and yet proof against the vandal fingers of familiarity ; a joy always , a light for the dark places , a guide and comrade in stressful times ; and everlasting as the hills . Just as the poets have always sung of it . Would any man wear a sign , " Nothing doing ! " in the face of that ? The last afternoon of Shirley 's visit came , clear and crisp , a strong west wind lifting the haze from the tinted hills . They pretended to play golf , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that in strangely low tones , always soberly . After a while they gave up the pretense , sought a seat on a secluded sunny slope and fell into a long silence . " Shirley ! " he broke it at length . " Yes , David ? " " I 'll hate to see you go back . " " I know . I 'll hate to go , too . " " It  --  hurts me to think of your going back to work . " " Oh , I 'm used to it . " She smiled . A world of sweet courage was in that smile . " Shirley  --  dear ! " She raised her eyes to his . " A poor man  --  I suppose he 's a coward to ask a woman to share  --  But it would n't be for always . You believe that , do n't you ? " " I believe that . " " I 'd try to make up for the lack of money with other things  --  worth more than money maybe . Are you willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , David . " He sat very still . His face went white . A happiness , so intense that it hurt , flooded his being . " You really  --  mean that ? " he whispered . Tears of tenderness stood in her eyes . She had the sense of having found a rare treasure , worth any sacrifice . She was a little awed by it and lifted to a plane she had never reached before . " Of course , I do . " She laughed tremulously . " We 'll wait six months , to give you a chance to get ready . Then I 'll come to you . We 'll start very small at first and live on what we have , whatever it is . If it 's only seventy-five dollars a month , we 'll hold our heads as high as if we had millions . We 'll make the fight together . I used to think I never could do that . But now I want to . And then when your success comes it will be partly mine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The glow of a crimson sunset was about her . In her eyes was the glow of the flame he had lighted . If only the spirit of sunset might abide with us always ! . . . . The witch often turns herself into an old cat and plays with us poor mice before she rends us . Almost from the beginning of the engagement David 's clients increased in number . During the six months which Shirley had set as the term of their waiting his income was almost as big as that of the whole year before ; partly because he was taken in by Dick Holden  --  who had the knack of getting business  --  on a commission to which that energetic young cynic felt himself unequal . The fee thus shared was a substantial one . " Our love , " David wrote to Shirley , " was born under a lucky star . I believe we are going to have more than we expected . That makes me very happy  --  on your account . " Nevertheless , when the six months were at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " David , dear , " Shirley wrote , when she had been scarce a month gone , " could n't you manage to come on for a few days ? Maizie thinks I 'm crazy , and I want her to see you and be convinced that I 'm not . And I want to show off my wonderful lover to my friends . " David , nothing loath , went  --  a night 's journey into the West , to a city where hotels mounted high in the air and rates mounted with them . This journey became a monthly event . And when they were together , thought of the exchequer took wings . There were theater parties , at which tired Maizie was a happy though protestant third . There were boxes of candy and flowers , seeing which Shirley would cry , " Oh , you extravagant boy ! " in a tone that made David very glad of his extravagance . They loved ; therefore they were rich . What had they to do with caution and economy ? " We can be engaged only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it beautiful . Let us have something to remember . " Money , it seemed , was necessary to a memorable engagement . Maizie at sight of him opened her heart . Shirley 's friends hugged and kissed her and declared her lover to be all she had promised . The rich aunt regarded him with a disfavor she was at some pains to voice . " Shirley tells me , " she informed him , with the arrogant assurance of the very rich , " that you 're poor . Then I think you 're foolish to get married  --  to Shirley , at least . I wanted her to take Sam Hardy . I hope you understand my checks will stop when she 's married . " " But you 'll still give her your love , wo n't you ? " " Of course , but what 's that got to do with it ? " " Having that , " said David , with the arrogant assurance of young men in love , " Shirley will be content . " The rich aunt stared . " Humph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grown up . On your own head be it ! " Shirley took some risks in inviting these visits . The picture David had got had her and Maizie living in dingy rooms , marks of hardship and privation thick around them . In fact , he found her a charming hostess in a cozy little apartment , comfortably furnished , with pretty dishes on the table and even a few pictures on the walls . And clearly , to eyes that saw , it was homely faithful Maizie whose arduous but well-paid secretaryship financed this menage ; Maizie who , returning home tired from her long day , got the dinner ; Maizie who washed the dishes , that Shirley 's hands might not be spoiled , and did the mending when the weekly wash came back . Shirley set the table , sewed on jabots and did yards of tatting . Her " work " consisted of presiding over the reference room of a public library , telling shabby uninteresting young men where to find works on evolution and Assyrian temples and Charlemagne . This position was hers because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salary , together with the checks from Aunt Clara  --  not so big as the latter would have had David suppose but still not to be sneezed at  --  generally went to buy " extras , " little luxuries working girls do not often enjoy . But David was in love ; he saw only the mistress of his heart . And Shirley , who had the habit of contrasting what she had with what she wanted to have , did not see any risk incurred . " It 's been such a grind to-day , " she sighed , one afternoon when David went to the library to escort her home . " Fussing half the day with a long-haired Dutchman who wanted to know all about the origin of fire worship . Why should any one want to know about the origin of fire worship ? " David did n't know , but thought it a shame she had to fuss with long-haired Dutchmen . " It 's so deadly dull , " she went on in the same plaintive voice . " Oh , David , you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from this . I 'll be so happy when we 're in our own little home and I 'll be dependent again . " David 's emotions were too deep for words but he gave her a look more eloquent than speech . The experts are in accord as to the purblindness of love . No scales fell from his eyes , even when Maizie , on his next to last visit , made an occasion for a serious chat . " David , " she suggested a little timidly , " do n't you think you and Shirley had better wait a little longer ? " He laughed at the notion . " Do you think we 're not sure of ourselves ? " " Oh , no ! I 've no doubts there . Just until you 're a little better fixed financially . " He shook his head decidedly . " Things are going pretty well with me now . And I 've got to get Shirley out of this awful grind at the library . " Maizie smiled faintly . " It is n't hard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amended hastily . " It would n't hurt her to stay there a little while longer . You see , " picking her words very carefully , " Shirley is n't  --  she 's such a dear we 've all petted her a good deal  --  and maybe spoiled her a little . She has n't had to give up much that she wanted . People like to do things for her and give her things and save her from things . I think she does n't quite realize how much has been done for her . " " Do you think that is quite just ? " David was very grave . " She is very appreciative of what you 've done for her . " Maizie flushed under the reproof . " Oh , yes , " she went bravely on , " she 's a dear about that . That 's one reason why every one likes to do things for her . What I meant was , I do n't think she quite realizes how important it has been to her . You see , she has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came , they would be very real trials to her . And I 'm not sure just what she  --  just how she  --  " Poor Maizie , torn between loyalty to and fear for her Shirley , floundered miserably and fell into an ashamed silence . " You do n't know how brave Shirley is . Sisters are apt to be that way , I suppose . " Poor Maizie ! She flushed again and hung her head in shame because she had dared to suggest , however gently , a latent flaw in Shirley . " What you forget is , we have something that makes other things of no account . And besides , trials are just what you make them . If you look at them just as an adventure , part of a big splendid fight you 're making , they become very simple  --  you can even get fun out of them . And that 's what we 're going to do . " Maizie , with a sigh , yielded the point . But , " David , " she said earnestly , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Of course , Maizie . Anything but the one . " " Then , if anything happens and if you should happen to mislay those spectacles and  --  by mistake , of course  --  put on another pair , you wo n't judge her too harshly , will you ? Just say , ' It 's all the fault of that homely old Maizie , who did n't teach Shirley to take life so seriously as she ought to have done . ' You 'll say that  --  and think it  --  wo n't you ? " David laughed at the absurd notion . " That 's easy to promise . " They were married in May , on a night when the wind howled and the rain drove fiercely . The rich aunt gave Shirley the wedding , in the big house on the hill , and intimated that therewith the term of her largess had expired . All of Shirley 's home friends were there , exuberantly gay and festive , making merry because two lives were to be mated , as though that were a light matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be best man , were there thinking of David . In the room reserved for the groom Dick turned from the mirror where he had been complacently regarding his gardenia , and caught a glimpse of David 's face . " I say , old man , what 's wrong ? Funk ? Cheer up . It 'll soon be over . " " It is n't that . " Over David it had suddenly come that the mating of lives is not a light matter . Standing at a window , he had caught from the storm a vague presage of perils and pitfalls approaching , through and around which he must be guide for another . That other was very , very dear to him . The thought set him to quaking . It was the first responsibility he had had in all his life . Then quick upon the thought surged a wave of deep poignant tenderness for her to whom he must be guide . There was a tap at the door , answered by Dick . " They 're ready . All right , old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'm ready . " A minute later he stood waiting , while the old music rolled from the organ . A slender veiled figure appeared in a doorway . The mist in his eyes cleared away . Very steadily he took her . . . . . They entered their machine amid a shower of rice and old slippers . He caught her close to him and held her , silent . After a while he felt a sob shake her . " Why , dearest , crying ! " " Oh , David , be good to me ! I 'm afraid . A girl gives so much . Be good to me always ! " He drew her closer , if that were possible . " Of course , Shirley  --  always . You must n't be frightened . It 's the storm . In the morning the sun will be shining and things will seem different . " And sure enough , in the morning the sun was shining and things seemed different . CHAPTER II THE WITCH The perils and pitfalls appeared . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a guide David left something to be desired . Very carefully the lovers had planned the disbursement of their income : so much for rent , so much for the household and " extras , " so much for David 's down-town expenses . A limited amount was set for the furnishing of their home-to-be . With many declarations that love made up for all lacks and with many tiltings of Shirley 's pretty chin , they had vowed to adhere rigidly to this budget . But the choice of the abode of so much love and happiness had been put off until after the brief honeymoon , that Shirley might share the fun of house-hunting . They thought it would be fun . It was not . That week , as they inspected an indefinite number of apartments of as many degrees of shabbiness and general undesirableness , Shirley 's spirits and chin fell steadily . David 's heart , seeing , fell with them . " Discouraged ? " he asked at the end of the last day 's hunt . She nodded wearily . " Landlords are pigs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you sure there 's nothing else we can look at ? " " I 'm afraid not . I 've gone through the lists thoroughly . " " I would n't mind being shabby , if it were n't for the neighborhoods . " She was tired . Her lip quivered . His heart misgave him . He tried to be gay . " Oh , let 's forget it for a while . Let 's go out to the club and play nine holes and then have a little twosome at dinner out there . " They went . Low spirits rose on the scented May breeze . The dinner was a success . Afterward they met friends , who were regaled with a humorous account of the week 's adventures . The friends , of course , made suggestions . One in particular knew " the very thing you want , and really absurdly cheap . " She was enthusiastic in description . Then the rental was named  --  fifteen dollars a month more than the budget allowed . David made a great show of taking the address and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Let 's really see it , " Shirley suggested , as they rode home on the front seat of a trolley-car . " We 'd better not , " said David , clinging desperately to a dwindling remnant of caution . " Not to take it , of course . Only to remind us that there are pretty places in the world  --  waiting for us later on . " She snuggled closer to him . In the morning , of course , they saw the apartment . And it was almost uncanny , Shirley declared , how exactly it matched what she had had in mind . She proceeded to place in fancy David 's chairs and desk and lamps , the dining-room furniture that was to be Maizie 's wedding gift and the mahogany bedroom suite the Jim Blaisdells had given them . She went into ecstasies over the china closet , the dainty bathroom , the clean convenient kitchen . " David , ca n't you see it ? With a few small rugs and plain inexpensive curtains and the pictures we have it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And with the hardwood floors and tiled bath and that kitchen the housework would be so easy . " She sighed rapturously . " We 'd better get away . My mouth is beginning to water . I 'm sorry , dear . " He kissed her to prove it . " But we ought n't even to consider it . " But at the door she stopped and looked back  --  a risky business , as Lot 's wife once proved . She surveyed the place with a lingering wishful glance . " I wonder if we could n't make up the difference in rent by cutting down somewhere else . We could cut the extras in half . And I wo n't need any new clothes for a whole year  --  not a single stitch . By that time  --  " She paused , as it seemed for a reply . " Do you want it so much , Shirley ? " " Oh , if we only could do it , David ! " David , too , did sums in subtraction and found that , with care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the apartment . In fact , there came a time when David remembered , with a sickening qualm , that in almost every item they had stepped little or far beyond the limits of their budget . They did it because the disappointment written on Shirley 's pretty face when something on which she had set her heart seemed beyond their reach , was more than he could bear . But the old cat was still playing . It was a " boom year " : the beginning , said the wise statesmen and newspapers , of an era of unprecedented prosperity . The city was growing rapidly . Architects ' services were in demand . David 's business continued good . Among his clients was a gambling contractor who shaved his architects ' fees but made up for that by the largeness of his operations . There seemed to be no need of cutting down " extras . " They were not cut down . It was on the whole a cloudless year . There were , to be sure , a few little quarrels , impatient words sharply answered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restored . There were occasions when David found Shirley in tears , both cake or roast and fingers burned ; occasions which he made festive by carrying her off to the club for dinner . There were evenings at the theater and concerts , gifts impulsively bought and rewarded with kisses , little household purchases that gave a pleasure out of all proportion to their cost , as it seemed at the time . But there were never any doubts , nor any fears . For all their demands there was money . The handicap of debt under which they had started was even a little diminished . As for rainy days  --  but why should happy young love take thought of them ? On their first anniversary they gave a dinner in the apartment , twelve covers with flowers and all the wedding silver on display and a caterer 's man to serve . Shirley , in a new gown , was at her loveliest , beaming with the happiness of hospitality prettily dispensed . When the last guest was gone , they turned out all the lights but one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , snuggled close to him , and they fell into a long silence . After a while she stirred . " It 's been a wonderful year , has n't it ? " " You express the sense of the meeting , dear . " " Being poor is n't so bad , after all , is it ? " " Not bad at all , I find . " He took up the catechism . " You have n't once regretted that Sam Hardy chap , have you ? With all his money  --  let 's see , was it millions or billions ? " " Hush ! " She laid a hand over his lips . " Not even in fun . That 's almost profane . " There was another silence , broken at length by a contented chuckle from David . " Am I doing anything specially ridiculous ? " she murmured sleepily from his shoulder . " I was just remembering . A year ago tonight I was frightened almost into a faint . I thought living together might turn out to be hard . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You must excuse them . If they had been lovers out of a book , they would have talked in dithyrambs or long perfervid paragraphs . Since they were real , they could bear witness to their happiness only by spooning and being a little bit silly . But  --  it was part of their happiness  --  they did not know they were silly . The beginning of the second year was like unto the first . But the witch was biding her time . Toward the end of that year the sky darkened and the winds howled roughly around the house of love . Sometimes the designer of this pretty abode  --  if he was the designer  --  bethought him to look to its foundations . But they seemed strong and safe . In the first place , there was a sudden falling-off of new business . It was so with others than David . Only a temporary slump , said the wise statesmen and newspapers , due to trivial causes and not long to interrupt the era of prosperity . Jim Blaisdell shook his head and advised his friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counsel made him growl , " Asses ! "  --  a sweeping epithet that included David , who was not so deeply troubled as he should have been . Unfinished commissions kept him reasonably busy , and when they were concluded others would come to meet his needs . They always had ; therefore , they always would . David was content with this logic . In the second place , a baby was coming . And many and elaborate were the preparations for this momentous event . Countless stitches must be taken , a serious number of dollars spent , that the prettiest layette possible might await the coming mite . But Shirley , in one of her soft house dresses , head bent over her dainty stitching or laying out before him for the hundredth time the tiny articles she had collected or her friends donated , made too pretty a picture ; he had not the heart to ruffle it with discussions of economy . And when , her time drawing near , she complained of the work in the flat , a maid was installed . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shabby and he felt he could not afford a new one . For despite his optimism David was beginning to take thought of the morrow . And this leads to our tertium . Sometimes he had moments of restiveness , so vague and fleeting that he could not define them , under what he did not know . There were times when little criticisms of Shirley would pop maliciously into his mind , never worded , hastily banished and always followed by a reaction of shame that he should have become critical even in thought at such a time . To correct this disquieting tendency he took medicine for his liver . And growing upon him was his joy in his work : not the old boyish enthusiasm at the thought of ultimate recognition , nor yet the later gratification that he was earning money against their needs , but a deep-seated content merely to be in it , an almost personal affection for the sketches which , after a lapse , had once more begun to multiply . Gently overruling Shirley 's protests , he had taken to sitting up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pregnant silence of midnight he would sit before his easel , smoking furiously and occasionally making a light swift stroke , until the clock struck one or two or even three . Many nights would pass thus , and there on the easel would stand a restful little chapel or a noble cathedral , with separate sketches for details such as doors or rood screen or altar , the very presentment of which , if only in black-and-white , filled him with a solemn worshipful glow . He did not hug himself or say that " they " would have to come to him yet , but would pat the sketch lingeringly , thinking , " I 'd like to see you real . " The next evening he would show the completed sketch to Shirley , who would give it a cursory glance and say : " It 's very pretty . I wish some one would let you build it . It would be a big commission , would n't it ? " " Yes , " he would answer , with a slight sinking of his heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the big portfolio and hastily change the subject . One evening the house shook in the wind . It was after dinner and David was opening a new book he had brought home , a bulky volume bearing the formidable title , Ecclesiastical Architecture Since the Renaissance . Shirley found a seat as close as possible to him and began . " David , I have a confession to make . " A smile proclaimed her assurance of absolution . " Yes , " he smiled back . " I broke a rule . I  --  had something charged . " " Oh , Shirley , when we  --  " " But wait until you see what it is . Then scold me if you can . " She led him into another room where on a bed reposed a hooded wicker basket , lined and covered in silk  --  blue for a boy  --  with fine lace trimmings . She awaited his verdict . " It 's very pretty . But  --  How much was it ? " She named the price . He whistled . " Would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you ought to be ashamed of yourself . " Her indignation was three-fourths in earnest . " I 'd be ashamed not to get Davy Junior the very best of everything . It 's the duty of parents to get their children the very best of everything . " " The best they can afford , yes . But  --  However , it 's here and the only thing to do is to pay for it . I 'll send a check in the morning . " He returned to the living-room . Shirley followed . He stood for a long minute by the table , looking down at the new book . Then he restored it to its wrappings . " What are you doing ? " " I think I 'll not keep it , after all . " " What is it ? " " A book I wanted for some cathedral sketches I 'm making . " She studied his face intently . " David Quentin , do you mean to say you begrudge things for Davy Junior , when you can buy expensive books for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his lips  --  that professional knowledge is always an asset . But the words did not fall . Nor did it seem worth while to tell her that for three weeks he had had his lunches over a dairy counter to save money for the book . Instead he mustered a smile . " As you see , we 're keeping the bassinet and the book goes back . " She saw only the smile . " Why , we almost had a tiff , did n't we . Brrr ! " She pretended to shiver . " And you know we must n't have them , because they 'd have a bad effect on Davy Junior . " So that squall passed , and they talked of Davy Junior . And Davy Junior  --  they were sure it was to be a boy  --  was already a personage in that household , a hope and a love in which both shared . But long after Shirley had gone to bed David sat thinking of the episode . One of the little criticisms , quite definite now , lingered : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wisdom , that her attitude was a little too possessive , her demands upon his time and thought and scanty store of money a trifle less than reasonable sometimes . Sternly he crushed the suspicion back . " It must be that I 'm settling down . The novelty 's wearing off . And I suppose , having no one but myself to think of for so long , I did get to be pretty selfish . I must be very careful . " But somehow the argument did not quite convince . " I wish  --  Maybe when the baby comes Shirley will take things a little more "  --  he halted before the word so disloyal  --  " sensibly . " . . . Davy Junior and the panic came at the same time . And with them came Worry . The wise statesmen and newspapers offered many explanations of the panic . But explanations could not soften the grim fact . Ruin stalked through the land , and its ghostly twin , Fear . Men who had been accounted rich , men who had been rich , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And what shall be said of their dependents , the small fry , earners of salaries , young men of the professions , who saw incomes curtailed or cut off ; to whom frank poverty would have been almost a relief but who must , as habit and the custom , of their kind decreed , keep up their sham and shabby gentility ? Business was at a standstill . The city ceased to expand . There was no building . Dick Holden closed his desk and locked his office door . " There 'll be nothing doing in our line for some while . I 'm going to Europe for two or three months to learn something about architecture . Better pack up your family and come along , Davy . " David laughed grimly . " My Dickybird , you 're quite a joker . " Trips to Europe !  --  when the apartment was a miniature hospital . Davy Junior was sickly . Shirley 's strength came back slowly . For six weeks the trained nurse stayed , ordering expensive things for her patients . Anxiously David saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old commissions were paid and disappeared down the hopper of household expenses . He took to thinking of what would happen when the commissions were all paid , and to haunting Fisher 's office . Fisher was his contractor client and owed him five hundred dollars . But Fisher always put him off . In the meantime the dairy lunch became a habit . He smoked only a pipe now . The books he loved and needed , little things he used to think were necessaries , were foregone . He thought wistfully of the indulgences he might have gone without in the past . Fisher continued to put him off . Then Worry began to shadow David by day , to share his pillow at night . If Fisher , like so many others , should fail  --  ! But with an effort he concealed the unbidden guest from Shirley . With her he was always cheery , ready with quip and laugh , teasing her over her devotion to that red-faced bit of humanity , hight Davy Junior . And in truth , the sight of her , still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby , would give him a fresh courage . Things could n't happen to hurt her , he assured himself . For her , for them ; he would weather the storm  --  somehow . " Why , " thus he would snub intrusive Worry , " we 've got Fisher , anyhow . When he pays , we 'll simply make it last until business picks up . " . . . . The doctor 's bill and word that Fisher had gone into bankruptcy reached him by the same mail . Dazed and trembling , he got out his bank-book and tried to strike a balance ; the figures danced crazily before him . But too well he knew that slender sum ! He could see barely a month ahead . He walked home that evening , to get a new grip on his courage . He found Shirley almost breathless with excitement . She waved a letter before him . " You can have two guesses to what 's in it . " But David was unequal even to one guess just then . " It 's from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out there for two or three weeks . You do n't mind , do you , David ? " " Do you want to go so much ? " " I 'm just crazy to have them see Davy Junior . And I have n't seen Maizie and auntie and the rest of them for so long . And I think the change will do me good . I get tired so easily , you know . " This last was a convincing argument and quite true . " I know . But I 'm afraid , dear , we ca n't afford it . " " Is business so bad ? " " It 's pretty slow  --  - and getting no better . " " Has n't that Fisher man paid up yet ? " He hesitated . But he could not find the heart  --  perhaps it was courage he lacked  --  to break his evil tidings to her . " Not yet . " " I 'd like to shake him . But he must pay soon . And anyhow , " she reverted to the original topic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd be only railroad fare and in two weeks  --  or maybe three  --  we 'd save that in house expenses . We could let the maid go , you know . " He caught at that straw . " And maybe , when you come back , you 'll be strong enough to get along without her  --  for a while ? " " Maybe . " Her tone lacked assurance . " We 'll try it , anyhow . " Two mornings later David stood on a platform and watched a train pull slowly out of the shed . Then he gulped twice , sternly set his teeth together and walked swiftly to his office . Shirley and the baby stayed , not two weeks nor three , but five . There were other expenses than railroad fare , just what her letters did not set out in detail . Twice she had to write to David for money ; in the midst of riches she found it hard to economize . Still David , by taking his meals at a cheap boarding-house , managed to save a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Shirley 's letters were glowing . She was getting stronger every day . She could lie deliciously in bed all morning , if she chose . Aunt Clara had a nurse for the baby . The weather was fine and there was motoring daily . All her old friends came to see her with warm words of welcome on their lips . Among them was Sam Hardy . " He is very nice . ( But you must n't think anything of that . Every man I see makes me glad I married my David . ) He has a gorgeous new machine and takes us all out . He gets his clothes made in New York now . Such good times as we 're having ! " And down in one corner of the last page was , " If only you were here ! " " P. S. , " popped into his mind . But very sternly he drove it out , calling himself hard names . Ought he not be glad that Shirley was having a good time ? " I am glad . Poor dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if things do n't get better soon . You see , " he explained to himself , " in some things Shirley has n't quite grown up yet , just as Maizie said , and good times mean so much to her . " He sat down and wrote her the cheeriest letter he could compose . He himself felt old enough to interest an antiquarian . Before Shirley came back he felt older , with nothing to do but sit idly in his office , figuring his bank balance for the thousandth time or working over some of his old sketches , jumping nervously every time the door opened . ( But the visitor always turned out to be some one who wanted to sigh and groan in company over the hard times . ) Of evenings in the apartment , which grew dustier and lonelier every day , he would write his letter to Shirley , mail it and then get out his easel . Frowning with determination , he would put and keep his mind firmly on a new idea for a Norman Gothic cathedral , until , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave him with the swiftly growing sketch . Shirley 's visit ended at last . David was pacing up and down the platform a full hour before her train was due . In the street-car that evening people smiled kindly at the pretty little family group  --  the gravely smiling young man who held the baby so awkwardly , the pretty wife bubbling over with joy in the reunion and with accounts of the good times she had been having . Afterward , when Davy Junior had had his bottle and closed his eyes , Shirley dusted off one chair and they sat down in it . " Now tell me about yourself and business and everything . " So , finding it harder than he had thought it could be , he told her of the panic and what it meant to them . She listened with a pretty air of taking it all in and making ready to meet the situation . When his account was ended , she pushed herself back to look into his eyes . " David , when did you know about that Fisher man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter . " David flushed as though he had done something shameful . Her eyes filled with tears . " And you kept it from me so my visit would n't be spoiled , and stayed here worrying by yourself while I was out there having a good time . Oh , David  --  Oh , David ! Well , " she got to her feet and stood upright before him , " I 'll tell you this much . Let the old panic come on  --  I 'm not afraid . We 'll make out somehow . And we wo n't worry either . What if we do have to give up things ? We have each other  --  and Davy Junior  --  and nothing else counts . " They repeated in chorus . " We have each other and Davy Junior and nothing else counts . " They were very happy just then and so it was easy to be brave . CHAPTER III ON THE SANDS In a few months the first stress of the panic lifted . The worry creases between men 's eyes were being ironed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cheap labor and materials , began to build . Dick Holden came home , with a trunkful of presents for his friends and another of English clothes for himself , and at once became busy . The Quentins were still hanging on  --  " by a frog 's hair , " David said . But they had paid . It always costs to survive . They had paid , despite their brave words , in the coin of worry . More than once David had jingled a few coins in his pocket , wondering where he could add to them on the morrow and when he had borrowed how he could repay . But they had paid with a bigger price than that . The pretty flower of romance was withering in the shade . The cozy little times , when one chair did for both and they became beautifully silly , were fewer and briefer now . When they tucked Davy Junior in at night and whispered that he was almost too bright to be healthy , shadowing their pride was the chill cloud of fear that he , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they moved restlessly about the apartment or sat listlessly yawning , wishing there were something to do . And sometimes , without warning , quarrels would blaze , over nothing at all . It is so easy to mislay your temper when worry is gnawing at your heart , and perhaps you do n't try very hard to find it . David always had to find his first , but the making up was never quite perfect . And , though their well-to-do friends were beginning to talk of new model cars and going abroad once more , the Quentins continued to be hard up . David seemed to have struck a dead level . One month business would be pretty good ; the next he would make almost nothing . But the average was always the same , and always a little less than they spent . The note at Jim Blaisdell 's bank and the little loans from Dick Holden kept slowly piling up , and though neither Jim nor Dick ever dunned him , the thought of his debts weighed heavily on David 's heart . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were kept zigzagging between hope and disappointment , and when they had money , it was often spent foolishly . David did his best to save . His suits and overcoat had shiny spots . He smoked only cheap tobacco that burned his tongue . He gave up even the dairy lunch , saying that two meals a day were enough for any man . He walked , rain or shine , to and from his office , and bought no more books . But the sum of these savings seemed pitifully small . Shirley , too , did without things during the lean months . But when a fee came in she could never say no to her wants . " We must have this . We must do that , " she would say . " Dear , do n't you think we 'd better go slow ? " he would venture . " Oh , what 's the use of having money , if not to get what we want ? " " We could use it to pay a little to Jim and  --  " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afford it . I 've had to do without so much I think I 've a right to this little spree . And I hate to wait for things . If I wait , they lose all their fun . " It always ended in her having her own way . But sometimes David wondered whether she would have lost interest in him , too , if she had had to wait . For he saw that another goblin had come unbidden into their home : Discontent . He had learned to seek and always found the wistful look with which she regarded their callers ' pretty gowns or heard tales of jolly dinners at the club . ( Months ago the club had been dropped . ) And he knew that in her heart she was drawing comparisons . Once she said , " It was n't like this when Maizie and I were together . " She did not guess the barb she left quivering in his heart . Dick Holden was making no such heavy weather of it . He was even so busy that little odds and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crusts for which the latter was as grateful as the Lazaruses always have been . But this suggested another comparison to Shirley . " Dick Holden gets business and makes money , and everybody says he 's not half so clever as you . How does he do it ? " " He works people for their business . " " Then why do n't you do that ? " " I do n't know how . And if I did know , I could n't , anyhow . The people that come to me come because they have confidence in my ability . If they do n't have confidence , I could n't work them because  --  I just could n't , that 's all . " " You 're too thin-skinned . If I were a man I 'd make them come to me , and then I 'd teach them to have confidence  --  the way Dick Holden does . " " Dick Holden 's way , somebody else 's , never mine , " he thought bitterly , " is always the best . " But he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said gently , " In the long run it 's not the sound way . If I do good work , some day people will realize it and come to me . And I do good work , " he cried , not to boast , but because their courage needed a tonic , " and some day when I get my chance I 'll do far finer . " She smiled wearily . " Some day ! It 's always some day . Why do n't you make your chance  --  as Dick does ? " That talk rankled in David 's heart long after Shirley had forgotten it . She could say such things and forget them in an hour . But her comparisons never angered him , only hurt . He tried to be just , and blamed himself for their predicament . If he had been wise and firm at the beginning , when the temptations to indulgences came , they could have escaped these troublous waters . Firmness now seemed only cruel . " You see , " he would explain to himself , trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still . It is very hard on her . If I said no to things now , she would n't understand . I must just make it as easy as possible for her  --  somehow . " But he sighed , " If only we could give up this apartment and live cheaply and  --  and honestly until we 're on our feet . If only she 'd look at it that way ! " He had suggested that to Shirley once  --  but only once . " Oh , no ! " she had cried . " That would be a confession to everybody . It would be humiliating , more than I could bear . We 've got to keep this apartment and not let people know we 're hard up . " They thought people did not know . So it went for nearly two years . You must not think there were no happy times , hours or days or even weeks when they took joy in their love and Davy Junior ; though more and more these times lost their wonderfulness and the power to charm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weary or despondent hours bulked largest in David 's mind because he took them so keenly to heart . Yet , though his debts slowly grew , and he was always a month behind in his office and apartment rent , he did not lose faith in himself ; he gave his very best to the little business he had and worked away at his sketches , which grew better all the time . ( It hurt him more than a little that Shirley took no interest in them . ) And though he saw clearly that she had faults , even as you and I , he did not lose faith in Shirley nor cease to love her . Often at nights , especially after there had been a quarrel , he stole away from his sketching to the room where she slept with the baby by her side and lightly kissed her hair or an outflung arm . Then the old tender protective impulse swept over him ; he wished he were the sort of man that could give her all the things she wanted , thinking that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " came . Or , rather , he tried to make one . A rich parish decided that it could best honor God by building a new church , finer and costlier than anything else in the city , and invited several architects to submit plans . David entered the competition , not by the adroit methods Dick Holden practised , but in the simple open-handed fashion which alone was possible to him . He went to the chairman of the building committee . " Will you let me submit plans ? " he asked . " I suppose so , " Bixby said carelessly , eying his caller dubiously . For David , though he had carefully pressed his trousers for the occasion , was getting to be a little shabby . If you looked close you saw that his cuffs were trimmed , his necktie was threadbare and his shoes were run down at the heels . And he had not the look that speaks of success . Seeing him , Bixby did not think as people had used to think , " This is a young man who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must the plans be filed ? " The chairman told him , and added , " You understand , of course , they have to be bang-up  --  up-to-date in every particular , and impressive ? " " Some things , " David said gravely , " are so beautiful that they are up-to-date in every age . And real beauty is always impressive because it is so rare . " " Humph ! " said Bixby , and dismissed his caller . David set to work that very night , going over all his old sketches in search of the best . And because none of them had ever quite satisfied him , he discarded them all . He began a new series of sketches , sitting up at nights long after he should have been asleep . He discarded these , too . For this idea must be so very good that the committee could n't help accepting it . " I think , " he told himself often , " I have reached the point where I can do something really worth while . " One night when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come . For a long while he lay staring at a white patch of moonlight on the floor . Suddenly he sat up , sprang out of bed and , still in his pajamas , sat down before his easel . In the morning Shirley found him there , looking raptly at the completed sketch . " David Quentin , what in the name of common sense are you doing here ? " " Look ! " he whispered , almost in awe . " This is it . " Shirley looked . And she , who had picked up a little knowledge of architecture from him , knew that it was good . " Do you think , " she asked , " do you think it really has a chance ? " " Shirley , it 's so good I can hardly believe it came out of my head . Maybe it did n't , but just passed through coming from  --  somewhere . " He was thinking it was an inspiration . . . . Well , since then many men who ought to know have thought and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months he toiled every spare moment of the day and in the still watches of the night , elaborating that first rough sketch , working out details , which came to him as of their own accord , making beautiful plans and elevations and long sheets of specifications . He gave to the work enthusiasm , patience and stern criticism . In return it gave him a new faith in himself . And hope . He knew he would not fail in this . It was not really hard work . For , as the weeks sped by , there grew up in his heart a love for the thing to which he was giving birth , deep , warm and abiding , a love that counted no hour of labor too heavy , no task too exacting . He did not care to think of the day when the work must pass out of his hands . A little of his ardor entered into Shirley . She , too , hoped . She thought of the fee such a commission would bring , of the release from care and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a glimpse of the new love growing up in David 's heart , but , though she did not wholly like that , she gave it no serious thought . " Would you mind coming back to me ? " she asked one evening , thus bringing him out of a smiling brown study . " I was just thinking what it would feel like to see the church real . " " Do n't you ever think of the money it will bring ? " " That , too , sometimes . But I never knew before how much the work  --  just being in it , you know  --  means to me . " " That 's very temperamental , " she said with a shrug . " Sometimes I believe you think more of your work than you do of your family . " " I love you both , " he answered gently . " And I do n't love you and Davy Junior less because I think so much of the work . " It was a fleeting shadow . Those months of preparation and hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Only once did his faith waver . It was on the day when Dick Holden , a roll of plans under his arm , came into the office . " Davy , are you too busy to do a little job for me ? " That was the formula Dick , who was very thoughtful in little things , always used when he turned work over to David . " I guess I can make room  --  with crowding . " That was the reply David , with a smile only half humorous , always made . " What is it ? " " I want you to make one of your pretty-pretty pictures of some church plans I 'm making . " " What church ? " " St. Christopher 's . " David looked up quickly . " Let 's see the plans . " Dick spread them out on the table . David glanced over them hastily . " You 're trying for it with that ? " " Even so . " Dick laughed . Dick at that stage of his career laid no claims to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 've been talking with old man Bixby . " David looked up again . " Dick , it 's fair to tell you that I 'm trying for that St. Christopher 's job myself . " " Meaning you 'd rather not make pretty-pretty pictures for a competitor ? " " No . I mean you 'd be wasting your money . " " Why ? " David drew out his original sketch and laid it before Dick . Dick looked  --  and looked again . He leaned over and studied it intently , his eyes widening and shining . Suddenly with a queer gesture he rose and went to a window . He stood there , back turned to David , for several minutes . When he turned a flush was on his face and he found it hard to meet David 's questioning eyes . " Davy , it 's good . It 's damn good . It 's so much better than mine that I ca n't find a comparison . I know just enough architecture to be sure of that . I take off my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you  --  it wo n't win . " " Why not ? " " I 'm going to win . " " With that ? " David nodded toward Dick 's plans . " With that . " " How ? " " I 'm giving old Bixby what he wants , and I 'm  --  " Dick made gestures of pulling wires . David was silent . " Maybe , " Dick went on after a moment , " you think I ought n't to work this game against you . And maybe I ought n't . But if I did n't somebody would beat us both out . They 're all working it . It 's the only game that pays nowadays . And besides , I need the money . It is n't out yet , but I 'm going to be married  --  and she 's used to a lot of money . I 've been doing pretty well , but if I land this job I 'll be fixed and able to give her the things she deserves . Do you blame me , old man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Not wholly , Dick . " There was another silence , awkward now , and then Dick began to move toward the door . But with his hand on the knob he turned . " Davy , why do n't you play the game ? You 've got the stuff . If you only could put it across , if you had the punch , you could go any distance . I  --  I 'm not quite big enough to step down for a better man , but I 'd rather have you beat me than any other man alive . Why do n't you try it ? " The troubled smile lingered . " I ca n't , old man . " David did not hear the door close . For a long time he sat staring vaguely at his sketch . But that night , when he was alone with his work once more , the old faith rushed back into his heart . Dick was wrong  --  he must be wrong ! The committee were honorable men ; they held a position of trust . Surely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dick 's . And surely they could not be tricked into passing them by for a hodgepodge that would only bring ridicule down upon their church . He was ashamed that he had lost faith , even for a day . Toward the end of the two months Shirley began to grow a little impatient with his industry . " Will it never be finished ? " she would sigh plaintively . " You never have any time to spare for me any more . " " You see , " he would explain , " there are so many details to be worked out in a thing like this , and I must n't slur over any of them . We must make it the best we can . And it will soon be done . " But a little throb of regret would clutch his heart as he said that . And one evening he did come to the end , the illustrative sketches complete , the beautiful plans all made , the last calculation for the specifications set down . " There ! It 's done . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sighing . Shirley looked up from her novel . " Thank goodness  --  at last ! Are you sure you 've made it the very best you can ? " " Yes . " He looked long at the sketch , a strange wistfulness in his eyes . " Sometimes I wonder if I shall ever do as well again . " " Suppose it should n't win , after all ? " " Oh , do n't ! " he cried . " Do n't suggest that  --  just now . " She caught the sudden sharp pain in his voice and looked at him wonderingly . " Why , what 's the matter ? " " Nothing , " he answered , his voice gone dull now . " I guess I 've been working harder than I thought and am pretty tired . " " You 'd better go to bed early and get a good sleep . " " Yes , " he said , " I 'm going to do that . " But he did not do that . Instead , for the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company of his completed work . It was as if he watched the night out with a loved one who in the morning must go upon a long uncertain journey . . . . This also Shirley , had she known , would have called very temperamental . For a month they waited , a feverish , anxious but always hopeful month , for the committee 's decision . And then one morning as he sat idly in his office an errand boy came , under his arm a long round parcel . " Mr. Bixby sent me with this . " When the boy was gone David quickly ripped open the parcel . It contained his sketches and plans . With them was a note . " As we have accepted the plans submitted by Mr. Richard Holden , we return yours herewith . Thanking you for . . . . " The rest was a dancing blur . . . . It was mid-afternoon when he rose from his table . The first dizzying shock had passed , but a dull unceasing ache was left and he was very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tatters of his courage and faith , but he could not think of the future . When he tried to think of Shirley a sickening qualm rushed over him , leaving him weak and nerveless . " Poor Shirley ! " he muttered . " How can I tell her ? Poor Shirley ! " Mechanically he put on his hat and overcoat and went out . It was storming . He had no umbrella , and if he had had one it would have been but scanty shelter against the driving rain . But he did not care . He was even glad of the storm and the discomfort of wet feet and clothes . For an hour he splashed aimlessly through the city 's streets . Then he turned slowly but doggedly homeward . " Poor Shirley ! " he kept saying to himself . " I must n't let her see how it hurts . I must put a brave face on it before her . " He was half-way home when he stopped with a sudden " Oh ! " that was almost a groan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was their fourth anniversary ! He took out what money was in his pocket , counted it and tramped back through the rain until he came to a florist 's . There he got a small bunch of carnations . It was all he could buy with the money he had with him , and it was too late to go to the bank  --  and little enough was there ! He started homeward once more . By the time the apartment was reached he had pulled himself together a little . With an effort he achieved a smile and went in . Shirley was waiting for him . " Any word ? " He shook his head . He could not tell her just then , but he could not trust his voice with a kindly lie . " Oh , I thought surely we 'd hear to-day  --  You 've brought something for me ? " " It is n't much . " He gave her the little box  --  it was rain-soaked now  --  and saw her face fall as she peeped within . Always he had brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kissed him and sent him to his room to put on dry clothes . They sat down to dinner , a special dinner with things they both liked and could not always have . And for a while he tried to be as merry as the occasion demanded . But not for long . His tongue fumbled over his poor little jokes and his laughter was lifeless . Shirley saw . " David , look at me . " His eyes wavered , fell , then rose doggedly to hers . " What 's the matter ? Something has happened . Do you mean it 's  --  " " Yes , Shirley . Dick Holden won . " For a moment she stared blankly at him , then burst into a storm of weeping . In an instant his own heartache was swallowed up in sorrow for her . He sprang to her side , catching her close and petting her , begging her " not to take it so , " saying foolish brave things . The storm subsided as suddenly as it rose . With a sharp movement she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with eyes in which he would have said , if he could have trusted his senses just then , anger and  --  almost  --  hate were blazing . " Shirley , " he pleaded , " do n't take it so . Our plans were good . It was only pull that beat us . Dick told me  --  " The eyes did not change . " It does n't matter why , does it ? They did n't take them  --  that 's all . What difference does it make if things are good when nobody will buy them ? And I had hoped  --  " " Dear , do n't take it so , " he repeated . " We must be brave . This is only a test  --  the hardest of all . If we 're brave and keep hanging on  --  you remember what we used to say  --  " She laughed , not her old beautiful laugh , but a shrill outpouring of her bitter disappointment . " Oh , we said a lot of silly things . We were fools . I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes , and even hate  --  were unmistakable in that moment . She sat up sharply . " And , David , you 've got to do something to change it . I 'm tired of it all  --  sick and tired of scrimping and worrying and wearing made-over dresses and being  --  just shabby genteel . You 've got to do something . " Every word was a knife in his heart . But he could not be angry with her ; he was thinking of her disappointment . " But , dear , I 'm doing all I can . How can I  --  " " You can get a position somewhere and at least have a steady income that would  --  " " Why , Shirley , you do n't mean  --  give up my profession ? You could n't mean that ! " " I mean just that . It would give us a steady income at least . " " But I ca n't give it up . There 's more than money to working . There 's being in the work you want to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She turned on him fiercely . " I thought you cared more for your work than for your family . Now I know it . You would keep us poor , just so you can do the things you like to do . And what right have you to think you 're fitted for it ? Why ca n't you be sensible and see what everybody else sees  --  that as an architect you are  --  " " Shirley ! " But she said it . "  --  a failure . " For a little he stared blindly at her . All other aches were as nothing beside this . . . . Then something within , that had sustained him since he left the office , snapped , gave way . His head and shoulders sagged forward . With a weary gesture he turned and went into the living-room . That storm , too , passed . It had been more than half the hysteria of shattered hope . She had hardly known what she was saying . Now she remembered his eyes as she had dealt her thrust . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She waited nervously for him to come back to her ; always David had been first to mend their quarrels , and Shirley thought her kisses balm to heal all wounds . But he did not come back . In the living-room was a heavy silence . At last she went softly to the door . He was standing by the table , still in the broken attitude , with the same dazed eyes . He did not see her . " David ! " He did not seem to hear . She went to him and put an arm around his shoulder . " David , I did n't mean to be nasty . It really is n't your fault . I did n't mean  --  " The sound of her voice brought him out of his daze . He shrank from her touch and , turning , regarded her with a queer new look that held her from him . After a little the sense of her words seemed to come to him . " I think you did mean it , " he said wearily . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " CHAPTER IV TO THE RESCUE In the morning the world , strangely enough , was outwardly the same . Even the sun had the bad taste to shine , as though a black shadow were not on their hearts . They went through the routine of bath and toilet and breakfast . David glanced over his newspaper and romped a bit with Davy Junior . And because he kissed her as he left for the day , Shirley supposed that the scene of the night before had been filed away with their other tiffs , in a remote pigeonhole labeled " To Be Forgotten . " She was glad of that . " And maybe , " she thought hopefully , " it was a good thing I said that to him . David is clever and good and dear and all that , but the trouble is he lacks ambition and push . He needs bracing up and to take things more seriously . Perhaps it will be just as well if I take the reins for a while . " Her first act as whip was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not guessing that the reins had been transferred to Shirley 's hands  --  not guessing , in fact , that they had ever been out of Shirley 's hands  --  was trudging listlessly , not to his office , but to Jim Blaisdell 's bank . His note fell due that day . " Same old story , " he told Jim . " I 'd like to renew , if you do n't mind . " Jim fingered the note thoughtfully . " Davy , " he said at last , " do n't you think it 's about time to clean this up ? It 's been running a good while . " David flushed and his head went up . " Of course , if you 'd rather not indorse  --  " " Do n't be a fool , Davy . It is n't that . There 's nothing Mrs. Jim and I would n't do for you and Shirley , and you know it . What I mean is , debt 's a bad habit . It grows on you and you get to a point where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it leads to other bad habits  --  living beyond one 's means , and so on . " David 's prideful pose collapsed suddenly . " I know , " he said wearily . " I 'd like to clean this note up . It worries me quite enough . But the fact is  --  the fact is , I 'm strapped and ca n't . We 've been living from hand to mouth for a good while . And it begins to look "  --  David 's laugh went to Jim 's heart  --  " as if both hand and mouth would be empty soon . " " It 's really as bad as that ? " " Worse than that . " Jim slowly scrawled his name across the back of a new note . David got up and crossed the office , fixing his eyes  --  which saw not  --  on a flashlight photograph of the last bankers ' association banquet . He cleared his throat vigorously . " It 's worse than that . Jim  --  " He paused . " Yes ? " " Jim , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job  --  living salary attached  --  concealed about his person , do you ? " " What ! " Jim whirled around in his swivel chair and stared hard at David 's back . David continued his regard of the bankers ' association banquet . " This is you in the corner , is n't it ?  --  Because , if you know of any such job I 'd be glad to take it over . " " In your own line , of course ? " " In any line . Preferably not in my line . " " But  --  good lord , man ! You 're not losing your nerve , are you  --  just because business has slumped a little ? What about your profession ? " " As to that , " David cleared his throat again , " as to that , I think we may say  --  safely  --  I have n't made good . " " Oh , piffle ! You 're too young a man to say a fool thing like that . If it 's this note that 's bothering you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jim saw his eyes . " The note is only part of it . But , if you do n't mind , we 'll not discuss it . I 'll be glad if you can help me out . And I 'll try to cut this loan down a little next time  --  somehow . I 'll not keep you any longer now . " David moved toward the door . " Remember us to Mrs. Jim , wo n't you ? " And he went hastily out . " Why , damn it ! " muttered Jim , left alone . " This is bad . This is entirely too bad . " David went to a long weary day at his office , where he had nothing to do but sit at his desk and gaze into space . Shirley was mistaken . Her words had not been filed away in the remote pigeonhole , " To Be Forgotten . " For a while Jim stared frowningly at the crumpled note in his hand . Then he began a long series of telephone calls . The thing was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the children 's dormitory and silence reigned at last through the house . " You might as well out with it now as later , " she observed , as she took up her sewing . " What has been bothering you all evening ? " " I 've been congratulating myself on my cleverness in the matter of choosing a wife . " Mrs. Jim surveyed him suspiciously . " What put that into your head ? " " Davy Quentin  --  by way of contrast , I suppose . " " What about Davy ? " " I 'm afraid he 's got into a pretty sour pickle . " " He 's been there for four years . Though he did n't always know it . What is the particular development now ? " " Debt , insolvency  --  in fact , genteel poverty . " " And worry , discontent and disillusionment at home . I 've been afraid of that . " " He did n't say so . " " Davy would n't , of course . " " It must be pretty bad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a job . You know , Davy 's liking for his work amounted almost to a mania . " " Does he have to give it up ? " " It does n't meet their needs  --  at least , their requirements . And worst of all , he 's got it into his head that he has n't made good . " " But he has made good . He has done good work . And he has talent . Has n't he ? " " In a way . But there 's only one divine spark nowadays  --  push . He has n't that . He prefers to let his work speak and push for itself . Poor Davy ! " " Poor Davy ! But you 'll get him a position , of course . " " There are times , " remarked Jim , " when you 're as innocent and credulous as Davy himself . It is n't so simple . He 's fitted only for his own line . And there are very few men willing to pay a living salary to a greenhorn just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm ready to say there is none . " " Poor Davy ! " Mrs. Jim repeated softly . She threaded a needle and bent over her sewing . Jim watched the swift deft fingers proudly ; they had acquired the habit of industry in a day when the Blaisdells had had to wrestle with the problem of slender income . After a few minutes ' silence she let her sewing fall to her lap . " I think , Jim , if you 'll have the machine around I 'll go down-town with you in the morning . " Jim sighed in relief . " You 've solved it , then ? " " I want to call on my latest acquisition . You remember asking , ' Why is Jonathan Radbourne ? ' " Jim nodded , with the smile the thought of that gentleman always evoked . " The answer is , of course  --  Davy . " " I 'm wondering , " said Jim thoughtfully , " just how Davy would like it if he knew you were going to beg a job for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job . I will merely state the case to Mr. Radbourne . " " Suppose he concludes that making a job for Davy is too high a price to pay even for your ladyship 's favor ? " Mrs. Jim smiled confidently . " Mr. Radbourne and I understand each other . And he does n't have to pay for my favor . I have made him a present of it . " Two mornings later David found a note from Jim , asking him to call at the bank . David obeyed the summons at once . " Davy , " Jim began , " did you mean what you said the other day about a job ? " " Yes , " David answered quietly . " Well , I took you at your word . And I think I 've landed you one . Radbourne &amp; Company want a good man to do mechanical drawing . They 'll pay a hundred and fifty to the right man at the start , and they 'll raise that later if you turn out well . Do you care to try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . " I still think you 're making a mistake  --  but that 's your business . Shall we go around to Radbourne 's now ? " " Yes . " To those three monosyllables David added nothing during the few minutes ' walk . Had Jim been leading him to the prisoner 's dock David could not have taken less joy in the journey . Jim discoursed of the judge before whom the prisoner was being led . " Odd fish , this Radbourne . Dinky little man . With whiskers . You 're apt to think he 's a fool at first . But that 's a mistake . He is n't at all  --  I 'd hate to lose his account . He makes machines in a small way , but very well and quite profitably . His father made a reputation for turning out high-class work and the son keeps it up . We got to know him at St. Mark 's . Mrs. Jim says he 's the only man of real charity she knows  --  not even excepting me . " David forgot to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where , behind a littered flat-top desk , the judge got nimbly to his feet ; although " judge " was in this case a queer fancy indeed , as David had later to confess . There are several ways in which men can be homely , and Radbourne , of Radbourne &amp; Company , had chosen the worst way of all . When you saw him you wanted to smile . He was little and roly-poly . His eyes were too small , their blue too light . His nose was acutely and ungracefully pug . His ears were too big and stood out from his head . His mouth was too wide . His hair and eyebrows were thick and red , too red , and his round chubby face was flanked by a pair of silky , luxuriant red Dundrearies that would have done credit to a day of hirsute achievements . His linen was strictly without blemish , and he wore a creaseless black frock coat and a waistcoat of brown broadcloth . And as he stood looking up at his tall visitors , head on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a sleek cock-robin who had just dined to his taste . He seemed to be in his late thirties . David would have smiled at any other time . " Why , this , " he thought unkindly , " is a mere comic valentine . " The comic valentine smiled , a little shyly it seemed , and put out a slender long-fingered hand . " This , " he announced , " is a great pleasure . " David took the hand and murmured something polite . Blaisdell chatted briskly for a few minutes , then departed . Radbourne turned to his draftsman-to-be . " Perhaps Mr. Blaisdell has told you we are needing a man here . Do you think , now you 've had a look at us , you would care to come and help us ? " " That 's a pleasant way of putting it , " said David a bit grimly . " I 'm needing a job badly . If you think you are n't afraid to try me  --  " Radbourne smiled protestingly . " If you knew all Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . You have warm friends , Mr. Quentin , if he is a sample . " " Did he tell you I 've failed in the only thing I ever tried ? " " He did n't put it that way , " the little man said gently . " Nor would I , if I were you . There 's such a thing as getting into the wrong niche  --  which is n't failure at all . Shall we consider it settled that you will come ? " " I 'd like to be sure , " David said , flushing , " that this job is n't one of your  --  charities . " The little man flushed , too . " Oh , I beg of you not to think that . I expect you to prove it a good stroke of business for me . And I hope we shall please each other . Your first name is David , is n't it ? " " Yes . " " And mine is Jonathan . That ought to be a good omen . Do n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absurdly out of place on the face of an employer , appeared again . " Why , I hope so , " said David . " And I hope you will like the work , though it may not be very big at first . I understand how important that is to a man . " Radbourne nodded gravely . " But I have a theory that if he puts his heart into his work he is bound to get a good deal of happiness out of it . Do n't you think so ? " " I 'll try to remember that . When do you want me to come ? " " Could you make it next Monday ? " " I will be here then . " David went away from Jonathan Radbourne , the comic valentine ; and the heartache , for some reason , was a little eased , courage a little stiffened . " After all , " he kept saying to himself , " it 's only a gift to Shirley and the baby . And I 'm glad to give it to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too . I owe them everything I can give . And maybe now we can be happy as we used to be  --  no worries or quarrels . " He tried to keep thinking of that  --  of the comfort in knowing that next month 's expenses could be met , of debts growing less , not bigger , of a love happily reborn under freedom from worry . He went to Dick Holden 's office . That busy young man met him with visible embarrassment , which , however , David ignored . " Dick , " he plunged at once into his errand , " I owe you a lot of money . " " Oh , not much  --  not worth speaking about . No hurry about that , old man . " David smiled grimly at that . " It wo n't be paid in a hurry  --  ca n't be . But I 'm quitting the game and taking a job , and I can pay you some every month now ; not much , but a nibble , anyhow . And if ever you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at nights , I 'd be glad to work part of my debt off that way . " " Why , " said Dick very eagerly , " that 'll be easy . I 've got three sets of plans I 'd like to have you work out right now . And there 'll be more . You know , I 'll be pretty busy over that St. Chris  --  " Dick 's tongue halted sharply and the red crept over his face until even his ears were glowing . " Of course . I have n't congratulated you yet . I do most  --  " " Do n't you , Davy Quentin ! " Dick interrupted fiercely . " Do n't you go congratulating me . I feel darn small potatoes just now . You 're quitting the game because I beat you out on the St. Christopher 's job , and I  --  " " Not at all , " David interrupted in his turn . " You must n't look at it that way . I was foozling my approach right along anyway , and the St. Christopher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't kill a summer thirst , you know . " He laughed at this slender joke so heartily that Dick was almost deceived . " Is it a pretty fair job ? " " I must say it is . And I expect to make a mighty good draftsman for Radbourne &amp; Company . I 've always been rather long on mechanical drawing , you may remember . And I 've got a first-rate boss , if I 'm any judge . On the whole , it looks pretty good  --  much better than dubbing along at a game where  --  where one has n't the punch , as you put it . " Dick flushed again . For several minutes he was silent save for the drumming of his fingers on the desk . Then he stirred , with a sharp irritable movement . " Well , I wish you luck . And I 'll have the data for those plans to-morrow . " David took this as a hint to go . When he had gone Dick heaved a sigh of relief . During those silent minutes a strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in lieu of the new job . Dick felt that he had had a narrow escape from an expensive generosity . Next David called on a young architect who was looking for quarters . To him it was arranged to transfer the office lease and to sell enough of its furniture to pay the rent in arrears . Then David went home to lay his gift at Shirley 's feet . And yet , as he neared the apartment , he felt a strange shrinking from telling her the news , lest she guess what his gift had cost him . He wondered at that . He found Shirley flushed with excitement over news of her own . " Guess who 's coming ! " David could not guess . " Aunt Clara ! " " Why , that 's fine , " he rejoiced weakly . Shirley kissed him nicely . " And , David , I think she 's coming to talk over things . " " Aunt Clara generally is  --  What things ? " " Why , our affairs . Money , you know . " His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Because  --  now do n't scold ! " She brushed an imaginary bit of dust from his shoulder . " Because  --  I asked her . " " Shirley ! " His clasp of her relaxed . " Now please , do n't let 's have another scene . What 's the use of rich relations if they ca n't help you out once in a while ? You 've no right to let your foolish pride cut Davy Junior and me off from Aunt Clara 's help . " " Luckily we sha n't need her help , because "  --  it was not so he had thought to tender his gift  --  " because to-day I got a job . " " A job ? Oh , David ! " Her arms tightened around his neck , Aunt Clara for the moment forgotten . " What is it ? " He told her . " Just a draftsman ? That is n't a very high position , is it ? " " Not very . " " How much does it pay ? " He told her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's only a little more than you have been making . " " At least , it 's steady and sure . " " But even Maizie makes that much . I used to get ninety from the library . I thought men  --  clever men  --  " " Beggars , " he said , " even clever beggars , ca n't be choosers . " " But we 're not beggars , are we ? " " Your Aunt Clara will think so . " He turned away into another room , leaving the matter of Aunt Clara suspended in the air . He saw then that he ran no risk of Shirley guessing what his gift had cost him . He wondered if he yet guessed how much it would cost . Soon Aunt Clara arrived , in a taxicab and wearing a businesslike , purposeful air . She made herself promptly and perfectly at home and freely passed judgment on all she saw ; and very little escaped Aunt Clara 's eyes . She inspected the flat and , inquiry establishing the rent , sniffingly reminded them that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begun their housekeeping in a fifteen-dollar-a-month cottage . Pouncing upon a drawerful of Davy Junior 's sweaters and slippers and lacy dresses , she cited the case of John , fils , who until he was three years old had never had more than two dresses and one coatie at a time . David 's books struck her as an appalling extravagance ; she and the late Uncle John had never thought of a library until they had ten thousand in bank . " You are very poor managers , I must admit . You 've been married more than four years , and what have you to show for it but didoes  --  and debts , as I understand ? " The question went home to David 's heart . But it was he who , catching up Davy Junior , held out the crowing youngster for her inspection . " We have this . " And then , a sudden wave of emotion surging unbidden within him , he caught the child sharply to him . He turned away quickly to hide this unwonted demonstration , but Aunt Clara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bread . " " Sometimes , " he returned gravely , " it makes dry bread palatable . " " Humph ! " remarked Aunt Clara . " And now let us have dinner  --  something more than dry bread and sentiment , if you please . I never talk business on an empty stomach . " To David , love and pride quivering from hurts lately sustained , that dinner , eaten to the accompaniment of the jarring critical voice , seemed endless . And yet , thinking of a worse thing to come , he could have wished it to last until midnight or that hour which found Aunt Clara too sleepy for business . It lasted until Aunt Clara had slowly sipped her second cup of coffee  --  which , inquiry brought out , cost forty-three cents the pound . Perhaps the dinner had mellowed her humor a little , for : " You may smoke , " she nodded to David , " provided it is n't one of those nasty little cigarettes . " " It will have to be a pipe . " " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Your late Uncle John smoked one to the last . " Then she produced and donned a pair of gold-rimmed spectacles and through them fixed upon David the sternest of glances . " And now , since I must leave in the morning , let us get to business . You may tell me the situation . " " What situation have you in mind ? " " The one that made you write to me for help . " " But I did n't write to you for help . " " Shirley did , which is the same thing . " " When Shirley wrote , without my knowledge , she had n't all the facts . I have just taken a position  --  " " That is very sensible . What sort of a position ? " " A very good position , quite sufficient for our needs . And so we need n't spoil your visit by discussing our dull affairs . " Aunt Clara glared . " Young man , are you trying to snub me ? I remember you tried that the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said David gently , " I have n't given you that impression . " " It 's just his silly pride , Aunt Clara , " Shirley put in soothingly . Aunt Clara silenced Shirley with a gesture and kept her attention on David . " You did leave that impression . And you are thinking that I 'm nosing into what is none of my business . On the contrary , young man , it is my business . You married against my advice , but it 's no credit to me to have my relatives hard up and in debt . You are in debt , I understand ? " " That is true , " David answered quietly , " but  --  " " But you do n't want my money to pay them with , you were about to say ? Young man , when you refuse my money , you 're a little  --  quite a little  --  in advance of the fact . I 'm not going to give you money . I do n't believe in giving money to able-bodied young men . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I will give you some advice and some help . You can take them or leave them . My advice is  --  get rid of this expensive apartment and store your goods . For the rest , I will take Shirley and the baby to live with me , paying all their expenses , until you can get on your feet . With your new position and no one but yourself to pay for , it ought n't to take long . " Shirley gasped  --  unmistakably with delight . David turned red , but he answered , still quietly , " It is good of you to make the offer , but of course it is out of the question . I think Shirley would prefer  --  " " Young man , " Aunt Clara reminded him , " in my family nothing I suggest is ever out of the question . As for Shirley , let her answer for herself . " " I think it would be very sensible , " Shirley answered for herself , eagerly . " She means , " corrected Aunt Clara , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be pleasanter living in my house than scrimping here to pay for dead horses . So it would . But it would be sensible , too . You 've got into hot water . I blame Shirley  --  I know her . But I blame you most . A husband ought always to keep a tight rein on household affairs . Your late Uncle John  --  well , never mind him . Because you 've been weak , you 've run into debt , the worst disturber of household peace . I give you a chance to be rid of it quickly . Have you a quicker way ? " " I have a better way . Since we got into the hole through our own carelessness , let us work our own way out . " " Humph ! More sentiment . You 'd make your family pay for your weakness . However , " Aunt Clara rose with the air of having done her whole duty , " I 've made my offer . It is for you to decide . I will now go into the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make it a rule never to intrude into discussions between husband and wife . " She moved toward the living-room . David ushered her to the door and closed it behind her . Then he turned to Shirley . . . . . He had made many mistakes , no doubt , been as weak and foolish as Aunt Clara said . But they had been loving faults , born of a deep desire to make Shirley happy . And he had atoned for them . He had declared himself to his world a failure ; he had swallowed and forgiven the word that ought never to be on a wife 's tongue . Because it seemed best for her , he had given up a work that was very dear to him , even in failure ; how dear , he had not known until he had resigned it , as he thought , forever . He had taken unto himself a master and a task that to his cast of mind could never be aught but drudgery . It was no easy thing he had done . But he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none the less brave because so boyishly obvious , to keep up a smiling front . He had sought to offer his gift from the heart , ungrudgingly , because he had loved her , still loved her , he thought . That which they had now to decide seemed big and vital to him . His pride was touched . A need was involved . Good sense might counsel acceptance of Aunt Clara 's offer , but he thought it cowardly . Since they had failed in the issue of making a living , the brave course was to retrieve that failure by themselves . More  --  it did not seem to him the act of a loving woman to leave him , even for a few months , when his need of her and her love was greatest . He did not ask her to count the cost of his gift ; he knew she could not . He did want her to justify the gift , to prove that the love for which he had paid so big a price was real love dwelling in a fine brave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table . He went to a chair across from her . She looked up eagerly . " Shirley , shall you mind very much if I say , no ? " " I think the only sensible thing is to take her at her word . " " Perhaps . But I 'd rather not be under obligations to  --  to anybody . " " Oh , that 's just sentiment , as Aunt Clara says . And it 's quite time for us to begin being practical . Think of being rid of all those horrid debts ! You do n't seem to understand what a weight they 've been on me . " " I think I do understand , dear . But it will be different now , because we know that if we 're careful for a while we can clean them all up . Radbourne seems a good man to work for and maybe this job will develop into something better . And I 'll be doing work on the side for Dick for a while . It wo n't be so long before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfaction of knowing we did it by ourselves , without any one 's help . We 'll have proved ourselves , do n't you see ? " " That 's more sentiment . I ca n't see anything so awful in going to Aunt Clara 's . It would be just a visit , such as any one would make . It would n't be for so very long , and it would do us all good . I would have a fine rest , and the change would be good for you , too . You could read and work in the evenings with no one to bother you . And you 'd have a fine chance to see all your old men friends . " " It is n't the men I want to see just now . Shirley , dear  --  " He was pleading now . " Shirley , dear , I  --  You see , it 's cost me a little , a good deal maybe  --  letting my profession go and taking up work that is n't  --  is n't so very interesting and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  just for a while of course , until I get used to the idea . And I 'd like to have you here with me . Do n't you see , dear  --  I need you . " But the plea failed . With a sharp sinking of his heart he saw her pretty brow wrinkle in an impatient frown . " I do n't see at all . I should think , if the position is such a good one , you 'd be glad you 've taken it . And you ought to be glad to think of Davy Junior and me out at Aunt Clara 's instead of moping around a cheap dingy flat or boarding-house . " " You mean , " he tried to keep his voice steady , " you want to go ? You 'd really rather  --  aside from saving money ? " " Want to ! I 'm wild to go . Of course , I 'll be homesick for you , but all husbands and wives expect to be apart sometimes on vacations and trips and  --  oh , David @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long since I 've had any really good times and I 'm hungry for them  --  starving . And out there at Aunt Clara 's , where you do n't have to think of money all the time  --  Why , you could n't  --  it is n't like you to be so selfish as to refuse me that . " He said no more . He sat fumbling with a napkin , his eyes cast down . He dared not lift them to Shirley 's , lest he see there a truth he had not the courage to face just then . After a little he rose , went to the door and opened it . " Will you come in now ? " he nodded to Aunt Clara . " The family council is over . " Aunt Clara marched into the room . " Well , what have you decided ? " " Shirley has convinced me , " he smiled queerly , " that you are right . But your hospitality is all we ought to accept . For her other expenses I will send something from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't what I  --  " " I 'm afraid , " he interrupted quietly , " you will have to concede so much to me  --  and sentiment . " . . . In the morning Aunt Clara left . " This is what comes , " was her benediction , " of marrying before you 're ready and living beyond your means . I hope it will be a lesson to you never to do it again . " David was too tired to smile . The rest of that week was too full for much thinking . The office was to be cleaned out . Trunks were to be packed , china and silver and bric-a-brac to be wrapped and boxed for storage , a thousand little preparations for moving when a new tenant for the apartment should have been found . David was grateful for that . He did not want time to think . Especially he did not want time to feel . On Sunday morning he took Shirley and Davy Junior to the train . Not once did he let the baby out of his arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shirley . " David  --  " They were sitting in the station waiting-room then . " David , it 's dear of you to let me go like this . " " It 's better than moping around here . " " You do n't think I 'm selfish in wanting to go , do you ? " He shook his head and kept his eyes on the child 's face . " It does n't mean I do n't love you  --  oh , with all my heart ! I 'll be so lonesome for you . I 'll be thinking of you all the time and write you every day . And when I come back  --  ! Do you know , dear , I have the feeling that now , with the new position and the debts cleaned up soon , things are going to be different with us , so much brighter . " " Why , I think so , Shirley . " " I 'm sure of it . " She squeezed his hand . " When people love as we do , things just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shirley . " The gates were thrown open and they went out on the platform . The train thundered in . David took Shirley and Davy Junior into their car . He kissed her hastily and lingered longer over his good-by to the baby . Then he ran out of the car and stood again on the platform , while Shirley made the youngster wave his hand . David managed an answering smile . He walked homeward by a long roundabout way . The rest of that day he spent in working feverishly at unfinished odds and ends of packing . Then he got out all his sketches and plans and slowly tore them into bits , until the floor around him was littered with the fragments . Last of all he came to the St. Christopher 's plans . But his hands refused his command to destroy . He sat looking at this evidence of his failure , until darkness fell and hid them from his sight . He rose then and , wrapping them up carefully , put them with the boxes for storage . There was nothing more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning but he was not hungry . He leaned back in a chair and let all the thoughts and feelings he had held at bay during the busy days rush at him in the darkness . An incredible loneliness was upon him , a sense of loss bitterer even than loneliness . It seemed that something for which he had paid dearly had been stolen from him . CHAPTER V GOOD FAIRIES But what of the fairies ? So far the old witch had had it all her own way , and that she had done very badly , if not quite her worst , you will have to admit . She had David by day in a cubby-hole office adjoining a noisy throbbing shop , making drawings of mechanical devices out of Radbourne 's or an irritable foreman 's brain ; by his easel in the lonesome apartment at night , working out on paper from Dick Holden 's notes the ideas of Dick 's clients , who knew exactly what they wanted but not how it would look ; saying sadly but sternly , " Begone ! " to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might nevermore hope to have a real birth . She had taken from him what no one could restore , the fine silky bloom of his youth ; and something worth even more , though that was a loss he was not yet ready to admit . Worst of all , she had him convinced that he was a failure , a weakling and misfit , a sort of green fool who had asked for the moon and been properly punished for his temerity . And that was a skein even fairies would find hard to unravel . But there was one who was willing to try . Who ever heard of a fairy with red Dundrearies ? Nobody , of course , but you shall hear of one now . Although the whiskers are really beside the case ; all a good fairy needs is a pair of keen eyes and a heart as big as a drum . An odd fish , no doubt of it , was Jonathan Radbourne , though a good man to work for and , as Jim Blaisdell had said and David soon found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hint of masterfulness about him , which was because he never thought of himself as a master . He never gave orders and never reproved ; he made polite requests and sometimes , gently and apologetically , he showed where mistakes had been made . If you happened to do about what you were paid for doing , he beamed with delight and thanked you as though you had done him a favor . He was always busy and nearly always on the move , flitting back and forth between office and shop with hopping little strides that made him more robin-like than ever , and really accomplished a great deal . But he often found time for friendly little chats with his employees on topics that had no connection with the business , such as the babies at home , the rheumatic old mother , the state of the heart or the lungs ; he made it a specialty to know all their troubles . And he always was smiling  --  on that mouth it was really a grin  --  a crooked cheery smile that made others smile , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first he made a habit of seeking out David . His manner on such occasions was one of shy wistful friendliness , not quite sure of its welcome , that gave David an impulse to pat him on the head and say , " There , there , little man ! It 's all right . You 're my chief and my time is all yours  --  though I 'd rather use it for work . " However , he never said that , but was always respectful and polite . He took advantage of these chats to learn more of his duties . With unwearied patience Jonathan explained them , as well as other details of the business , expressing delight at David 's interest . David saw that he had much to learn and he had grave doubts that he was earning his salary . He knew next to nothing of mechanics and did not always understand when Jonathan or Hegner , the foreman , explained some new device for which drawings were needed . But that wrought no change in Jonathan 's manner . " I 'm afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very clear on that . " And he would go over the explanation once more . When the drawings were correct : " Very good ! " he would beam . " I wish I could draw as beautifully as you . " " Do you think , " David asked on one such occasion , when he had been in the position nearly a month , " that I 'm really the man you want ? Sometimes I seem pretty slow . " " Oh , you must n't think that , " Jonathan said warmly . " You 're catching on faster than I ever hoped for . You do n't know what a help you are to me . The draftsmen I 've had before used only their hands . You use your head . " " Thank you , " said David , grateful for the assurance , even if the good will behind it was a trifle obvious . " And you find your work interesting , do n't you ? " " I 'm learning to like it  --  very much . " He tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left the office , Jonathan shook his head and sought out his bookkeeper . " That 's a very nice young man , Miss Summers , " he said . " Mr. Quentin , I mean . " Miss Summers agreed . " But I 'm afraid he 's pretty heartsore yet . " Miss Summers looked a question . " He 's a young architect , " Jonathan explained , " who did n't make good . I 'm afraid this work seems a come-down to him . " " That 's too bad , " said Miss Summers . " If you get a chance , I wish you would try to make things cheerful for him here . " " Of course , " said Miss Summers , who understood Jonathan quite well . " We 've got to try that . We must make a little conspiracy to that end . I 'll try to think up some details . " Miss Summers smiled as though she liked making little conspiracies with Jonathan . " Of course , " she said again , and looked upon that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . A little timidly , too ; which was strange , since with others in the office and shop she was not in the least timid . She could do little , it is true  --  a cheery " Good morning " and a friendly nod at evening , an occasional smile when something brought David into her office , once in a long while a brief little chat in which she , with a breath-taking sense of having an adventure , took the lead . Another young man might have detected her friendliness and considered his charms . But David , though his grave courtesy never failed , neither thought of his charms nor was conscious of hers . Her charms , to be sure , were not of a striking sort ; at least at first glance . She was a frail-looking body whose face was nearly always pale and sometimes , toward evening of a hot day , rather pinched ; her arms were too slender to be pretty and the cords of her broad white neck stood out . She was not very tall and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the window , she seemed more girlish even than her years , which were four-and-twenty . She did not look at all like an iris , even a white iris girl ; David would almost as soon have suspected Miss Brown . " I might , " thought Miss Summers , " be a part of the furniture , for all he sees in me . " She did not think it resentfully , though with an odd little twinge of disappointment . She regarded him as a very superior young man , the sort she had always wanted to know . But she had made a promise and she would not desert the conspiracy . She noticed that he never ate or went out at the noon hour , as if there were no such thing as an inner man demanding attention . Thereafter her luncheon , which was always carried in a dainty little basket , was seasoned with a conviction of gross selfishness . And one day , after she had eaten , she went , basket in hand , to the door of David 's little room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David was on his feet  --  one of his habits she liked so well ; other men in the office did not have it . " Yes , Miss Summers ? " She held out the basket . In the bottom reposed two fat cookies and a big apple whose ruddy cheeks had a rival in hers at the moment . " My eyes were bigger than my appetite . Would you care for them ? " " Thank you , Miss Summers , " he said politely , " but I never eat at noon . " " I wish you would , " she insisted . " If you do n't , they  --  they 'll spoil . " " By to-morrow ? Hardly , I should think . Thank you , no , " he repeated . " I find it does n't agree  --  " He saw her face fall . " On second thought I believe I will . They look so tempting . It 's very good of you to think of it . " He took the basket from her hands . But she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking up at him . He motioned to his chair , the only one in the room . " Wo n't you sit down ? " " But where will you sit ? " He answered by brushing some papers from the corner of the table and seating himself there . She took the chair  --  and the sense of adventure was very vivid . David bit into a cooky . " Fine ! This is good of you . Ordinarily I 'm not hungry at all at noon  --  habit , you know . But to-day I am . How did you happen to guess it ? " " I did n't guess it . I just thought  --  " She looked up at him again , timidly . " Often I bring more than I can eat , and if  --  " He had to smile at that . " Is n't that a little obvious ? I could go out if I wanted to , you know . " " Oh , I did n't mean that ! " She was overcome by confusion . " And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . " You need n't apologize . One need never be ashamed of a bit of hospitality , need one ? " To give her time to recover , he went on , " There 's a good deal of that around here , is n't there ? Tell me something about Mr. Radbourne . You 've been here some time , I believe . " " Two years . He 's the best and kindest  --  " She entered , eager to cover up her late awkwardness , upon a glowing history of their employer 's multifarious kindness . There was Miss Brown , the stenographer , rescued from the department store where she had been " dying on her feet , " sent to a commercial school and given a position she never could fill . And Blake , the collector , who had lung trouble and half the time was not able to report for duty . And Hegner , who was a genius but had a burning palate , picked up almost from the gutter and given an important place in the shop in the hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the latest recruit , but recently out of the penitentiary . " Though I wish he had n't taken him in . He looks bad and has fishy eyes and is always so surly . " " Is this a business or a sort of hospital for broken lives ? " David inquired . " I think in his heart Mr. Radbourne is more interested in the hospital . " " It 's too bad he 's so homely , is n't it ? It 's rather hard to take him very seriously . " " Yes . " She sighed , then caught herself up loyally . " No ! Because when you get to know him you do n't think about his face at all . " David was thinking he had not done full justice to her face . It was spirited and really intelligent , he decided , though its prettiness was as yet open to question . He perceived what hitherto he had missed : that she had hair and eyes quite worthy of consideration . Black as night the former was , and fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and neck . The eyes were a peculiar slaty gray and had depths inviting inspection . He found himself wishing he could see them really alight . " It would be something , " he said thoughtfully , going back to Jonathan , " to be able to run that sort of hospital . But what a crew of lame ducks we are ! Except you , of course ! " She laughed . " Oh , you need n't be polite . I 'm one , too . Not a very big one or very tragic . A lame duckling , shall we say ? " He suggested that a lame duckling might grow up into a wonderful swan , and munched his apple ruminatively . Neither happened to think of a certain incident , much discussed , in which that edible figured prominently . And he did not ask a question . " But how does he get his work done , with such a crew ? " " We 're not all lame ducks , you know . And  --  you work hard , do n't you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " " We all think that . Even the big strong ducks like to work for him . " " I 'm told he makes money . " " A good deal more than he spends on himself . I keep his personal accounts and I know . Several of his specialties are very valuable , inventions of his father 's that are still in demand . He 'd make more money if he had a better system . Hegner says he ca n't accept all his orders . Maybe , " she suggested , " you could help him there ? " He shook his head . " I 'm afraid , Miss Summers , " his laugh was not pleasant this time , " I do n't know much of anything useful . " " You could learn , could n't you ? " she asked quietly . He flushed , because he had let himself whimper . " Why  --  I suppose I could try . " She left him then . And strangely  --  how , he could not have told  --  soothing oil had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most men he should have been happy enough . He had work , clean and honest , that he was learning to do well . He had paid a first installment on his debts . Dick Holden had been as good as his word , the evening hours were busy ones and Dick would soon cease to be a creditor . Shirley wrote daily . She was well , the good times had materialized , Davy Junior was learning a new word every day and they both were so homesick for him . He was learning a new thing  --  to work , not with the natural easy absorption in a well-loved calling , but with faculties through sheer force of will concentrated on tasks set by others , in which he had no heart ; to shut out of mind and heart , while he was working , all other facts of his life . It is a good thing for a man to know . But , let his will relax its grip , and instantly his hurts began to throb . His pride had suffered ; he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chosen calling . The new work was not his work . Desire for that would not die , despite failure . His mind , once freed from his will 's leash , would leap , unwontedly active , into the old groove , setting before him creations that tantalized him with their beauty and vigor and made him yearn to be at work upon them . And that was a bad habit , he thought ; if he was to learn content in the new work , he must first put off love for the old . When the debts were paid , the work for the successful uninspired Dick should cease . And in idle moments , though they were few , and in sleepless hours , not so few , the incredible loneliness would rush upon him , not lessened by custom ; and a more poignant sense of loss . To that vague sense he carefully denied words , lest definition add to the hurt . Perhaps he was more than a little morbid . Men are apt to be so , when harassed overlong by care . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and seeking an anodyne only in a wearying routine . That afternoon the subject of the noon hour 's chat came into David 's quarters to ask a question about some drawings . The errand accomplished , he , too , lingered . He refused the chair David vacated and sat on the table . " I heard you and Miss Summers talking a while ago , " he said abruptly . " You said you heard  --  " David looked up , self-conscious . " I heard you laughing . " Radbourne 's eyes twinkled keenly down on his draftsman . " So you were talking about me ? " " There was nothing you could n't have heard  --  without offense , sir . " " I know that . Miss Summers is a loyal friend . " " I hope the same can be said of me , sir . " " Would you mind , " Jonathan asked , " not sirring me like that ? That 's a very fine young lady , Mr. Quentin . " " Evidently , " said David , though with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspiration to any man , " Jonathan continued . " I have no doubt . " Jonathan smiled . " Meaning you do doubt it ? But I forgot  --  you probably do n't know . She had a disappointment , Mr. Quentin , a heavy one , and she bore it as  --  as you and I would have been proud to . She had a voice . And just as she was beginning to make her living out of it and getting ready for bigger things , she took diphtheria . It left her throat so weak that she had to give up singing , altogether for a while , professionally for good . " " Why , that was too bad ! " " It was very bad . But she did n't whine . Just put it behind her . Since she had to make her own living somehow , she went to a commercial school and studied bookkeeping . I was lucky enough to get her . " " She could really sing ? " " She would have gone far , very far . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closely enough to know . I have never been reconciled  --  " Jonathan broke off sharply , staring hard at a crack in the wall . The little blue eyes were very sad . David , too , fell into a long thoughtful silence . He broke it at last . " As you say  --  " Jonathan started , as if he had forgotten David 's presence . " As you say , it called for more courage , because she was a real artist and not a proven failure . " " But I did n't say that . " " You had it in mind when you told me that . You are quite right . Thank you for telling me . " " There ! " Jonathan beamed happily . " I said she was an inspiration to any man . " " At least , " said David grimly , " she is a good example . " Jonathan left . But in a moment he returned . " Do you like music ? " " Very much . " " Then one of these evenings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and have some , if you 'd care for it . " " I should be glad to . " " Next Saturday , perhaps ? " David repeated his polite formula . Jonathan eyed him wistfully . " You know , you 're not obliged to say that if there is something else you would rather do . I should n't care to take advantage of my position to force my company and  --  and my friendship upon you . " " I should be very glad to have them . " And when he had said it , David knew he had meant it . " Both of them , " he added . The little man 's face lighted up eagerly . " You really mean that ? " " I certainly do . " " I am very happy to hear you say so . You see , " Jonathan explained , " I lead a rather lonely life of it , away from the shop . I am not equipped for social life . People of talent and agreeable manners and taste do not seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be blamed , of course . " The homely face was sad again . David was uncomfortable and silent . " However , " Jonathan 's smile reappeared , " I am fortunate to have found congenial friends here . Miss Summers is one . And now I add you to the list . With two friends a man ought to count himself rich , do n't you think ? " David agreed smilingly . Jonathan started away for the second time , then caught himself . " I forgot . I am ashamed to have forgotten . Perhaps you ought to be with your family Saturday evening . I should hate to feel  --  " " My family is away . " If David 's voice had become suddenly curt , Jonathan did not seem to perceive it . " Then we 'll consider it settled . " This time his departure was final . And the cloud , lifted a little by the efforts of a white-faced bookkeeper and a comically ugly manikin , settled upon David once more . He bent grimly to his interrupted work . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the occasion of Saturday . It was not hard to obtain . " I like that young man , " he confided . " I think we 're going to be very good friends . " " I hope so . " " Yes . It would mean much to me , Miss Summers . " " But I was thinking of him , " she said gravely . And the slate-gray eyes , as they rested on the little man , were very gentle . . . . . CHAPTER VI SPELLS A unwonted excitement pervaded the offices of Radbourne &amp; Company on that Saturday morning , radiated no doubt from the head of the concern himself . He flitted about restlessly , tugged at his whiskers continually , and his voice , as he rattled off his correspondence to Miss Brown , had a happy boyish lilt . Occasionally , chancing to catch Miss Summers ' eye , he would nod with a sly knowing smile . For the original program for Saturday had been enlarged . Miss Summers and David had been notified to be ready at mid-afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived . Radbourne glanced out into the street , nodded with satisfaction , closed his desk with a bang  --  greatly to the relief of Miss Brown , who would now have leisure to recopy the letters she had bungled  --  and vanished into his cloak-room . At the same moment David strolled into Miss Summers ' presence , watch in hand . " The hour has struck , " he burlesqued . " What doth it hold ? " " Whatever it is , " she answered , " you must seem to be delighted . " " I think I shall be . " David was actually smiling . " For the last hour I 've been looking at my watch every five minutes . This excitement is infectious . He has n't grown up , has he ? " " But is n't that his great charm ? " Miss Summers seemed already delighted over something . " Charm ? " David looked doubtful . " I had n't thought of him as  --  " But he did not finish . Quick staccato footsteps were heard . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for motoring , in visored cap and duster , with a huge pair of shell-rimmed goggles that sat grotesquely athwart his beaming countenance . On one arm he carried a veil and another coat . " Ready ? " And to their astonished gaze he explained , " First we 're going for a little run  --  if it is agreeable to you ? " They assured him , in italics , that it was . " Then let us hurry . " He handed the coat and veil to Miss Summers . " I brought these along for you . They are my mother 's . I got them for her but she never would go out in a machine . She thinks it would be tempting Providence . I 'm sorry , " this to David , " I had nothing to fit you . Can you do without ? " David put him at ease on that point , and Miss Summers retired . In a few minutes , fewer than you might suppose , she returned . Radbourne clapped his hands in delight . " Look , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure that he had never done justice to the face peering up at him from under the veiled hat . He was bound to admit that it had , after all , certain elements of prettiness ; he was astonished that he could have thought otherwise . But then he had never seen her when cheeks glowed shell-pink and eyes danced with that undefined but delicious sense of adventure . As he looked he smiled . It was a very friendly smile and the shell-pink deepened . A touch on his arm interrupted  --  it seems there was something to interrupt . " Have I taken a liberty ? I called you David . " David turned the remnant of the friendly smile upon Jonathan Radbourne . " Of course not . I hope you will do that again . " Jonathan beamed . " Thank you . And now , shall we start ? " An hour later they were bowling swiftly along , up hill and down dale , over a smooth country road . Fields of young corn sped by , stretches of yellowing grain that rippled and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose shadow was a caress . The host of the occasion sat with the chauffeur , turning often to point out to his guests some beauty of landscape they already had seen , commenting tritely , obvious as always in his effort to be entertaining , happy in the belief that he was succeeding . And he was succeeding ; such is the uplifting power of the spirit of true friendliness , even when dwelling in a dinky little man with whiskers absurdly swept by the rushing wind . The guests were silent for the most part when his comments did not call for answer . In the girl  --  she seemed very girlish that afternoon  --  the sense of holiday and adventure continued , her eyes shone softly and the pretty color did not fade . This despite her seatmate 's evident wish to be left to his thoughts . She had no wish to break through his reserve . But she wondered , a bit gravely , what he was thinking , and she did wish she could make things brighter for him , the superior young man who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so aloof and was so evidently subject to the blues . She thought she knew what troubled him . She could understand that . She was not always so contented as her quiet cheery manner proclaimed ; sometimes , in the middle of the night , she awoke crying for the gift that had been taken from her . His thoughts were less somber than from his long face she supposed . He , too , had his pleasurable sense  --  of respite . For once , though idle , neither loneliness nor dejection oppressed him . It was good to lean back lazily in the chariot of the rich , dreamily watching the ever-shifting picture , soaking in the sunshine . It was good , too  --  but in no-wise alarming  --  to have beside him this pretty girl who knew when not to talk and in whose occasional smile was a new subtle flattery . It was even good to be with that odd fish Jonathan Radbourne , for whose company , in a more fortunate case , he would have had no desire . He was glad Radbourne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of a long climb , to a ridge lifted high above those they had crossed . On its crest , at a word from Radbourne , the chauffeur brought his machine to a stop . Behind them lay the rough broken country of the foot-hills through which they had passed . And before  --  the mountains ! To them the eyes of the holiday-takers turned and clung . Range after range they rose , like mighty billows , mounting higher until the tallest , dimly outlined in a thickening purplish haze , cut the sky , a rampart vision could not pierce . They seemed alive , those hills , the thick untouched growth stirring ceaselessly under the wind , a restless sea of sunlit green with flashes of white from laurel thickets and soft glintings where satiny oak-leaves caught and tossed back the slanting rays . And they sang . " Listen ! " Jonathan commanded , and the chauffeur shut off the panting motor . They listened  --  all but the chauffeur , that philistine , who opened the hood and gingerly felt of the heated engine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the forest , came to them . David heard a long wondering sigh from the girl beside him . Jonathan , too , heard and turned quickly . " That is real music , is n't it ? " She nodded . " Is it worth the long ride ? " " The ride was good enough in itself , but this  --  ! I never saw mountains before and I  --  oh , there are n't words for it . " " I know , " Jonathan nodded , and the little twinkling eyes , even through the hideous goggles , seemed very tender as they rested on her . " ' I will lift mine eyes unto the hills . ' The old fellow who sang that knew what he was talking about , did n't he ? If you 've happened to mislay a faith anywhere , the mountains are a good place to look for it . " " Even faith in one 's self ? " " The easiest to lose and the hardest to recover ? Yes , even that . Particularly that . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over yonder . I 've never been able to do that , but often , when the world seems a little  --  gray , I ride up here for an hour . It does me good . " The philistine yawned and turned his passengers ' thoughts to a more interesting matter . " See there . " He pointed to a thin low-lying cloud on the western horizon . " That 's the city . ' Most sixty miles . Done it in two hours , up-hill more'n half the way , too . " " That 's very good time , is n't it ? " said Jonathan politely . " Humph ! " The philistine 's disdain was marked . " We 'll do better'n that goin ' back . That is , " he hinted , " if the dark do n't catch us . " It seemed best , on such sound considerations as a waiting dinner , to take the hint . The big car panted once more , moved slowly along the ridge , then dipped sharply as it took the down grade . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheels . The girl , half turned , wistfully watched the mountains until the ridge rose to shut off the last crest from her sight . Then she settled back in the seat as though she were very tired . David saw and on an impulse leaned toward her . " Do you mean , " he asked in a voice so low that the others could not hear , " that you lose faith in yourself ? " " It 's the same thing , I suppose . I lose courage sometimes . I get tired of trying to like to do things I never really can like . " " I understand , " he said gently . " Mr. Radbourne told me about you . Will you let me say , I am very sorry ? " She started , as if she had forgotten herself , and flushed deeply in her contrition . " There ! I 'm perfectly nonsensical , letting myself be a cry-baby just when I 'd intended  --  It is n't my habit at all . There 's nothing really to be sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put your heart into it , you 'll get  --  " , " A great deal of happiness out of it , " David finished dryly . " Exactly ! I recognize the formula . Also its author . I think you 're just whistling to keep up your courage now . " " But that is n't a bad thing at all to do . Why  --  " She turned to face him , with a little gasp for her daring . " Why do n't you try it ? " It was his turn to grow red . " You think I 'd be more cheerful company ? " " I think , " she said , with a pretty gravity , " you make too much of being a  --  lame duck . And I think that is n't like you . " " How do you know whether it 's like me or not ? " " That , " she laughed to cover her discomfiture , " is an embarrassing question . But I do think it . " " At least , I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to be thankful when I find good  --  friends ? " She nodded emphatically , and indicated their host . " Two of us . " " I 'll hold you to that . And , " he continued , " you make me a little ashamed . I should like to say that you , being with you , is very good medicine for lame ducks . " Another flush  --  not of contrition this time nor yet of displeasure  --  deepened the pretty color . He pursed his lips and whistled , as well as he could against the rushing wind , a bar or two of the latest popular melody . They found humor in this and laughed , so merrily that their host turned and beamed approvingly upon them . It was a good car and the chauffeur was as good as his word . The miles stretched out behind them , at a pace that forbade conversation . The exhilaration of speed was upon David ; and a deeper joy , born of a friendship found in a waste of loneliness . The late June @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outskirts of the city and drew up before a rambling white house set well back on a velvety lawn . Two great elms stood in the front of the yard and rhododendrons bloomed against the wide porch , their fragrance lingering on the evening air . " That , " said Jonathan , " was a very spirited ride . But I hope , " this to David , " you are n't sorry it 's ended , because this is my home , where we want you to come very often . Miss Summers , " he added , " already knows her welcome is sure . " He got to the pavement and helped Miss Summers to alight , as deferentially as if she had been the finest lady in the land . And , despite red whiskers and cap and goggles , to David the manner did not seem absurd . . . . A little later David descended from the room where he had removed the traces of their ride . At the parlor door he stopped , looking uncertainly at the sole occupant of that cozy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folded , on a pillowed settee , where the glow of a shaded lamp fell softly upon her , and David thought her the most beautiful thing he had ever seen . A very wisp of a woman she was ; he could have held her in his arms and scarcely felt the weight . But he would have taken her very tenderly , so fragile she seemed . Under a filmy lace cap her hair , still fine and plentiful , shone silvery . The face , though the face of age and white and thin almost to transparency , was strangely unlined . She wore a black silk dress with many folds and flounces and fine ruching at neck and wrists . He thought she was taking one of those naps which are the prerogative of age at any hour , and began to tiptoe away . But she started and sat upright , her face turned toward him . " Who is it ? " she asked . " But I know . You are Mr. Quentin , of course . I am Jonathan 's mother . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It seemed incomplete . " You may come in . " She held out a hand . David advanced and took it . She caught his in both of hers , in a soft lingering clasp . She smiled again . " It is a good strong hand . You are quite tall , are n't you ? " " Almost six feet . " " And broad , too ? " " Rather , I believe . " He tried to speak lightly , but a hard lump was gathering in his throat . For he knew what was wrong with that smile . She was blind . " I am glad of that . " She nodded brightly . " I am very fond of large men . It has been my cross that Jonathan took his size from me and not from his father . I could walk under his arm and not even graze his sleeve . " She drew him down beside her . " Do you mind if I touch your face ? " " It is n't much of a face , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She reached up and passed both hands over his face , a light caressing touch he scarcely felt . " Now , " she smiled , " I see you . You are quite mistaken . It is a good true face and I like it very much . Ah ! " She had touched his lashes . " You are feeling sorry for me . But you must not , " she chided gently . " I do n't like people to be sorry for me . " To that David had no answer . But on an impulse  --  or it may have been an inspiration  --  as the little hands left his face , he brushed one lightly with his lips . She beamed  --  always with that pathetic lack  --  just as Jonathan did when something pleased him . " That was very pretty . " She nodded again . " I see I am to like Jonathan 's new friend very much . You know , you have quite won him . He talks of you all the time . You like him , do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Better all the time , " David answered promptly and with truth . " I am glad of that . And it is good of you to come here . We have so few visitors  --  I suppose , " she sighed , " because we are n't very interesting . I am afraid Jonathan gets very lonely sometimes , having to spend most of his evenings here with no one but me . Not , " she made haste to add , " that he is n't always good to me . " " I think he is good to every one . " " You have found that out ? It is because he had a great disappointment once , I think . " " One would never guess that . " " No . Of course , when one has had a disappointment or been made to suffer , one makes up for that by trying to make the world brighter for others . " " It seems , " said David , " that some people do that . " " He wanted to play the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that he had talent . But his father forbade it . He said it was n't a man 's work to fiddle in public . My husband , " she sighed , " was a very firm man and wanted Jonathan to learn the business . So Jonathan went to the technical school here and studied engineering . Jonathan , " she added proudly , " had been well brought up and knew that his parents were wiser than he . " " I see , " said David . " But I think , " the little lady went on , after a pause , " we did n't know how hard it was for him . I understand better now . Sometimes , though he does n't suspect , I hear it in his playing . Then I wonder if we were wiser than he  --  and if I was selfish . Of course , the music would have taken him away so much and it would have been very lonely for me  --  and very dark . Sometimes I wonder if that was n't his real reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You say nothing . " Even without eyes to give meaning , her smile was wistful as a child 's . " Are you thinking he would have been happier  --  or better off  --  in the work he wanted than in taking care of me ? " " I think , " said David , " he is happy because he stayed with you . " " He has said so himself . " She sighed . " I wonder  --  I wonder ! " For a little they said nothing , David thinking very hard . " And now , " she said at last , " you may tell me what you think of Miss Summers . " " Why , " he answered , " she seems very attractive . " " Jonathan has led me to believe so . And a gentlewoman , should you say ? " " I think so , " said David , who had not thought of it at all . " Oh , yes , undoubtedly . " " That is my opinion . And she sings very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a dinner that included creations not found in cheap boarding-houses : fried chicken , for example , tender and flaky and brown , and crisp waffles with honey , and sweet potatoes in the southern style . It was cooked and served by a white-haired old negress whose round eyes popped with pride at the destruction David wrought . She listened shamelessly , fat bosom aquiver , to her radiant master 's quips , commenting , " Mistuh Jon'than ,  --  chuckle  --  ef yo ' ain '  --  chuckle  --  de beatenes ' evuh ! " and warned David in a stage whisper to save room for a miracle of a pudding to come . Mrs. Radbourne opened the casket of her memory to display several well polished anecdotes of a day when the world must have been very bright indeed , full of light and color ; chiefest jewel of which concerned a meeting with the elder Booth , from which occasion her husband  --  that very firm man  --  had emerged with credit . If , as some wise man has said , wit is all a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been very witty indeed . And across the table from him sat a pair of slate-gray eyes , still aglow with that sense of adventure . Then there were cigars , mild and very good , smoked on the porch ; both ladies protesting that they liked the fragrance of tobacco . And then the host , with the air of having come to the real business of the meeting , rose and said : " Shall we have some music now ? " " Oh , by all means ! " said David politely , wondering how much credence he ought to place in the advance notices . They went into the parlor , where Jonathan turned to Miss Summers , " Do you feel like singing this evening ? " " Yes , " she said , and went at once to the piano . She played a few chords softly . And then her voice rose in a low crooning note that went straight to David 's heart . For she sang as the thrush sings  --  because God had put music in her heart and shaped her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to be revealed through song . And that evening , in the simple little slumber song she sang first , there was no faltering or roughened note to tell that part of her gift had been taken from her . While she sang , there was nothing in the world but melody and the rest of which she sang . . . and the singer . She ended . But over at least one of her audience the spell of her voice lingered . For a long moment David sat motionless , lips parted , staring wonderingly at her , even after she had swung around to face them . " Why  --  " he stammered foolishly . " Why  --  I did n't think  --  " The rose pink in her cheeks became rose madder and it was easy to see that she was happy over something . " Oh , " she said , " it just happens to be one of my good days . Sometimes my voice leaves me in the middle of a note and lets me down flat . " She laughed , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laugh . He saw no humor in that . He could not believe that it had ever happened . . . . And so she became the iris girl . But he did not suspect that yet . He was not looking for iris girls ; it is much to his credit . They did not notice the excitement glistening in Jonathan 's eyes . " You have been practising again , " he declared . " Just a little . And only for the fun of it . Not in earnest of course . It 's your turn now . " He said no more about her practise but got out his violin , tuned it carefully , opened a book of music before her and waited for her to play the prelude . Then , tucking the violin under his chin with an eager caressing gesture , he began to play . That was a night of wonders to David . He was transported from a world of failures and disappointments into a delectable land where a dinky little man , armed with nothing but a horsehair bow and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sing songs of love and throb with pain and dark passions and splendid triumphs . That is always magic , though some call it genius . And the magic did not cease there . It touched the player , transformed him . The homely manikin , a bit ridiculous with his mannerisms and whiskers , a trifle too obvious in his good will to others , disappeared . Where he had been stood a man strong but fine and gentle in his strength , proud and passionate , as strong men are apt to be , but brave enough to turn willingly from his chosen path because another way seemed best . David , watching the player 's swaying body and transfigured face , understood , as even the blind little mother could never understand , how much her son had given to her . " If only he could be playing always ! " Jonathan 's mother slept . But for two hours the man who was no longer manikin and the girl who in real life was only a frail little bookkeeper played to David : a brilliant polonaise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music , a concerto that only the masters attempt , a few noble old classics . Between them she sang thrice , songs chosen by Jonathan , each a little more taxing than the one before . Not once did she falter and only once , in the last song where her contralto voice had to take b-flat above middle c , was there a hint of strain . More than rare harmonies and melodies and rhythms were coming to David . Player and singer , though they did not know it , were giving themselves to him . This was the man , and that the girl , whom  --  rather patronizingly , as though he were conferring a favor  --  he had let proffer their simple unaffected friendship ! " He gave up his work of his own accord for that poor old woman who ca n't even guess at what it cost him . She was forced out of hers when success was in sight . I do n't know which is worse . And they do n't make gloomy grandeur out of it . " The last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the music . Esther  --  for that was her name  --  pointed in dismay , toward the clock and the sleeping hostess . " Thank you , " said David from his heart . He was thanking them for more than the music . Mrs. Radbourne stirred , yawning daintily . " Are you stopping so soon ? My dear , you sang very prettily . Jonathan , you surpassed yourself . Particularly in the Largo . I remember Ole Bull , in ' sixty-seven . . . . " When that anecdote was concluded , the guests rose to leave . Because it was very late , Mrs. Radbourne prevailed upon Esther to stay overnight . David would not be persuaded . So they gathered around him at the door . And , having shaken hands , he said again : " Thank you . And I should like to say  --  " A sudden awkward lump jumped into his throat . He began anew , " I should like to say  --  " But what he would like to say would not be said . " Good night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jonathan Radbourne stood before the cold fireplace , tugging with both hands at his whiskers . " Miss Summers , " he said , " that young man grows nicer all the time . " " Yes , " she said . " I wish I could make things brighter for him . " " You are , I think . " " No more than he has earned from me . He 's a very faithful worker , you know . I must look up some of his professional work . And I have an idea that concerns you , young lady . There 's a new throat specialist I 've just heard of . You 're to call on him on Monday . " David walked home . When that absurd lump had been conquered he began to whistle determinedly , as became a young man who was no longer to make gloomy grandeur out of his failure . He kept it up until he reached the apartment and its chill loneliness smote him . " Oh , Shirley , " he cried , " if only you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not complete , because it might have been lacking in loyalty . . . . A new tenant for the apartment had been found . The next Saturday David turned the key for the last time on a scene of defeat . He was not sorry to leave . That night he took a train for an over-Sunday visit with Shirley . She had been urging him to come . " I know it 's an extravagance , " she wrote . " All the nice things are . But Davy Junior and I are so homesick for you . " David 's heart cut no capers at that , even before he read what followed . " I 'm afraid people will think it queer , your not coming , and of course , I ca n't tell them it 's because we are poor . " It was an unsuccessful trip from the beginning , though Shirley , all smiles and exclamations , met him at the station and hugged him so hard that she wrinkled his collar . She took him to Aunt Clara 's in that lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " as if she had been born to automobiles and chauffeurs . There the day was taken up by many guests  --  including the resplendent Sam Hardy , in cutaway and silk waistcoat , New York made , that made David feel shabbier than he looked  --  come to inspect Shirley 's husband . The only real " aside " he had was with Aunt Clara , who quizzed him concerning the state of his debts . " You are doing quite well , " she was pleased to approve . " I begin to believe there 's something in you , after all . " " Thank you , " David murmured , as politely as the case allowed . " Now do n't get huffy with me , young man , " she said . " That 's saying a great deal , from me to you . You ca n't expect me to fall on your neck . " " Not exactly , " said David . " Humph ! " she sniffed . " Sounds much like ' God forbid ! ' Which is n't grateful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you only knew it . Shirley 's better off here  --  and you 're much better off having her here  --  than back there pinching pennies with you . There are some things Shirley never could understand . " David answered nothing , but a little voice within was piping , " It is true ! It is true ! " Aunt Clara looked at him sharply , then suddenly  --  to her own great surprise  --  blew a trumpet blast from her long nose and said : " Tut ! tut ! Do n't mind my impertinent old tongue . I like you better than I sound . You may never set the river afire , but you have a pretty patience I never had . And I could be a fool over you , if I let myself . Do you want me to send her back home ? I will , if you say the word . " David hesitated a moment . " Do you want her to go ? " " No , " said Aunt Clara . " Shirley can be good company when things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go ? " " If she does , " said Aunt Clara , quite herself once more , " she 's bearing up under the disappointment remarkably well  --  for Shirley . I take it my question is answered . " Shirley and David went to the station as they had gone from it , alone in Aunt Clara 's car . All the way he was trying to tell her of the new resolve he had taken when Jonathan and Esther Summers made music for him . It was strangely hard to tell . Not until they were in the station , with but a few minutes left , did he find words for the essay . " Shirley , I 'm afraid you thought I was pretty babyish  --  about giving up my profession . I  --  I was babyish . I 'd like you to know I 've got my nerve back . " Shirley was very sweet about it . " I did think you were a little foolish to take it so hard , dear , when the old architecture never brought us anything but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at it sensibly . " And she dismissed the subject with the carelessness it may have deserved . " When do you think Mr. Radbourne will raise your salary ? " " Probably before I have earned it . " " David , do you think we 'll ever be rich ? " " I suppose not . There seems little chance of it . " She sighed . " There is nothing in the world but money , is there ? " Tears of self-pity were coming into her eyes . " It 's terrible , having to look forward to being poor forever . " The train announcer made loud noises through a megaphone . David rose and looked down in a sudden daze at the pretty young woman who was his wife  --  to whom he had become but a disappointing means to an end , to whom his heart , though he might thrust it naked and quivering before her eyes , would ever be a sealed book inspiring no interest . His pretty house of love was swaying , falling , and he could not support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said queerly , " that we 'll always be hopelessly , miserably poor . " Even Shirley could perceive a cryptic quality in that speech . " What do you mean by that ? " " Nothing that need disturb you . I have no reason , " he added grimly , " to believe that it will disturb you . " She eyed him reproachfully and gave a sigh of patience sorely taxed . " David , I wonder if you never realize that in some of your moods you are very hard to understand . " " Too temperamental , I suppose ? Right as always , my dear . " He laughed . Men sometimes laugh because they can not weep . But Shirley did not know that . " But I think I can promise you  --  no more temperament . I 'm learning a cure for that . And now I 'd better turn you over to Charles . I think that noise means my train is ready . " He took her to the car , kissed her and helped her into the seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the station just in time to catch the train . Shirley found herself perturbed and close to tears ; she hardly knew why . " I wonder what he meant by that about temperament ? " She sighed again . " Sometimes I think the worry and everything are turning David 's temper sour . I wish  --  I wish he were like other men . He does n't realize how trying he is sometimes . " And Shirley being Shirley , she bade Charles drive faster and tried to put David 's unlikeness to other men out of her mind . David being David , he sat up all night , submitting to his cure for temperament . He was facing the truth from which he had been hiding ever since Shirley went away . His heavy sense of loss had been defined . A little imp with a nasty sneering voice that jabbed like a hot needle perched itself on his shoulder and kept dinning into his ears : " The truth is , you had nothing to lose but a fancy . Shirley never really loved you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of a good time , and not worth the price . You did n't really love Shirley , only what you thought she was , what you see now she is not . Therefore . . . " CHAPTER VII SANCTUARY Some men fall out of love with their wives as easily and unconcernedly as they fell in . They even feel a sort of relief , thinking a disturbing factor thus removed from their lives , and they live happily ever after . But they are not " temperamental . " It was not so with David . He thought it a tragedy , at least for a while . Even when it had failed him , when it had refused to shine in darkness , itself turned upon him in an hour of need , he had not lost faith in love . He had said in his heart , " At least I have love left , which is worth while in itself ; and having that , I can yet work out some sort of happiness for us all . " He had clung desperately to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had been clinging to an illusion . When he found that out , he had nothing left . He was bewildered by the task of working out a happiness where no love was . How could he rebuild when he had not even wreckage with which to build ? He went to live at the boarding-house where he had been taking his meals , a dingy cheerless establishment that had but the one merit of cheapness . He spent his evenings there alone , smoking too much , reading or working for Dick Holden . The cheap tobacco burned his tongue and the loneliness , more than ever , ate into his soul . He thought of going out to call on the Jim Blaisdells or for dinners with the men he had used to know . But he shrank from that because he supposed his old friends must be saying , " That David Quentin  --  poor Davy !  --  has quite petered out , has n't he ? " As probably they were . He had sense enough to understand that these nights were not good for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to exist a good many years yet and make a living for myself and Shirley and Davy Junior . So I must n't let myself get into this sort of a rut . I must hunt up a more cheerful place to stay . " When a love is dead , it is dead , and there 's an end to it . After a decent period of mourning you get used to the fact . . . . The office , after all , was not so unbearably prison-like . There was the balm of friendship  --  a double friendship  --  which is good for the self-respect of a man . And there was the work , with which he was growing more familiar and which , therefore , was more easily and quickly and better done . At his own suggestion the scope of his duties had been broadened ; and he borrowed books from the library and tried to study out schemes to systematize Jonathan 's business . Some of these schemes were not wholly absurd and one or two were adopted , which pleased Jonathan far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ putting his heart into his work , but he was giving fidelity and a desire to do his best ; and he was getting back , perhaps not happiness , but at least a measure of the honest workman 's best reward . So that Jonathan 's theorem was given a partial demonstration . Jonathan saw . " Mother , " he said one evening , " I am more than a little ashamed . I took David Quentin into the office because Mr. Blaisdell said he was badly in need of a position and nothing else offered . I 'm afraid I thought it a charity and was rather patronizing at first . I 'm afraid , " Jonathan sighed , " I am puffed up at times by my charities , which do n't amount to so much , after all . " " We are not required to be too humble , " she reminded him . " Why are you ashamed just now ? " " It was n't charity at all . David is really a very capable man and a hard worker . He more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that very soon . I ca n't understand how he failed as an architect . " " Perhaps he did n't have the right talent . I understand architecture is a very difficult profession . " " It is a noble art , " said Jonathan , " and very few men have the talent . That must be the explanation , though I 've looked up some of his work and it seems quite as good as that of many architects I know . But I find it hard not to be glad that he was forced to come to me . He is the most likable man I have ever met . " " He seems attractive , " said his mother , less sweepingly , " and has excellent manners . He is good-looking , is he not ? " " Very . " Jonathan winced . " He is just what a man would like to be . And I never had a friendship that meant quite so much to me . " " Has he displaced Miss Summers ? " " Miss Summers , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read to-night  --  Earnest Maltravers ? " Boarding-houses that are both good and cheap are not easy to find . David took his problem to Esther Summers . It made an excuse for a minute 's chat . He liked to watch the dancing lights in those expressive gray eyes . " Do you happen to know of any pretty good boarding-house ? I say pretty good , because it has to be pretty cheap , too . The place I 'm at now is a nightmare . They 're always frying onions . And the star-boarder is a haberdashery clerk . He looks like an advertisement of ready-made clothes and talks out of the side of his mouth in what he thinks is an English accent . He 's always talking to me about the squabs on his staff . " " What is a squab ? " she asked . " I 'm not quite sure , but I think it 's a wholly imaginary creature much taken by the charms of haberdashery clerks . " " I see . I do n't think of any place now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " My aunt has a third-story room that is empty . It 's a very nice room , though it is n't furnished now . There are only two other roomers , who are very quiet and never bother any one . We never fry onions and there is a pretty good boarding-house only a block away . You could get your meals there . " " It sounds like the very thing . I could furnish the room myself with some of my stuff that 's in storage . And  --  Do you happen to live there ? " " I happen to . Of course , if that 's an objection  --  " She laughed . " Would you let me set my door on a crack when you sing ? " She nodded . " Since you 'd probably do it anyhow ! " " Then I think I could waive that objection . Would you mind speaking to your aunt about it ? " " This very night , " she said . That is how David went to live under the same roof that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He saw her very rarely there . In the morning he left the house before she did , at the end of the day stayed longer at the office ; not by intention but because his work called for longer hours . In the evening she stayed with her faded old aunt in their part of the house . The other roomers were as quiet and exclusive as the prospectus had promised . So David , in his new quarters  --  pleasant enough once his things had been installed  --  was left alone with his books , his letters to Shirley and his work for the successful Dick Holden . But there was something in that house  --  not to be accounted for by mere creature comforts  --  that made it easier to fight off the blue devils of loneliness and took away a little of the reminder 's stings when some tantalizing shape appeared in his tobacco clouds . Every morning he was awakened by her voice at the piano , a few minutes of scales and then one song , always a true matin song , full of hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she sang again , a little longer at scales and another song , sometimes two . Then David 's door would be set on a crack and he would lean back in his chair , listening and thrilling with some emotion as vague but as beautiful as a very good idea in ecclesiastical architecture . Sometimes a film would come over his eyes ; it is not clear why , for when she sang he forgot to remember that he was a failure , that he was in mourning for a love lately dead and that he had become a mere drudge for money . One evening when he had been under that roof for nearly three weeks she did not stop with the second or even the third song . Ballads and arias followed until she had sung steadily for more than an hour . Wondering , David stole from his room and sat with the other roomers on the stairs , listening raptly to the golden voice that floated up to them . And not once did it falter or lose its pure timbre . Silence fell at last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their rooms . David went down to the parlor . The singer was still sitting before the piano , absent eyes fixed on the open sheet of music ; a happy but half-incredulous smile was playing about her lips . It became a friendly welcoming smile when she saw him at the door . " Did you like my little concert ? " " Like it ! " He used a gesture to explain that she had set too big a task for his tongue . Her cheeks made answer . " Do you know , " he asked abruptly , " that your voice is getting better and stronger all the time ? " " I think so , " she said quietly . " Do n't you think that maybe your throat is getting well ? " " I think so . But I ca n't be sure . It 's too soon to tell yet . And it 's too good to be true . " " Oh , no ! " he protested . " You must n't say that . You must n't think  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ queer advice from me . " " But it 's very good advice  --  for any one , I am sure . " Her eyes had become very grave . " And I should n't have said that , for it really does n't matter so much as it did once . You see , I was pretty cowardly about it at first , when I found I could n't depend on my voice . Because I could n't have all I wanted I would n't have anything at all . For two years I would n't sing a note . The doctor says the long rest is what gives me a chance now , but I do n't deserve that . I made myself foolishly unhappy . But it 's different now . Even if I ca n't go back to studying or ever hope to do big things , I know I can sing a little for myself and get a great deal of happiness out of that . " It may be that her smile was a little too bright . " Do you really mean that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again to keep up your courage ? " " If I 'm only whistling  --  why , please let me whistle . But I think I do mean it . It 's very sound philosophy . Even if the lame duckling ca n't fly , is there any reason why it should n't waddle for the fun of it ? " And now the smile was just as it should have been . David considered that . For some reason hidden from her his cheeks were burning ; you would have said that he was ashamed again . " No reason at all , " he said at last , " if the duckling happens to be very brave . But I hope she is going to fly very high and very far . " And with that he left her , more abruptly than was polite . She would have been glad to have him stay longer . For many minutes she sat there by the piano , thinking not of the gift that seemed to be coming back , but of the queer lame duck who took his lameness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such employment . She wished she were a fairy godmother , so that she could by a wave of her wand make his wings whole once more . Up in his room David , too , was thinking earnestly . After a long while he rose from his chair , set up the easel and began to work , not on a pretty-pretty picture for Dick Holden , but on an idea of his own that lately had been haunting him . That became a habit in his spare hours . Swiftly the new idea took form , as the flower grows in the field , without travail or effort . He worked harder than ever at Jonathan 's drawings those days  --  hot lazy days they were , too  --  to earn release a half-hour earlier ; and he swallowed his dinners more hastily than was wise . Then , when no hack work for Dick Holden was to be done , he sat at his easel sketching until the clock struck an hour  --  more often two  --  after midnight . Esther 's aunt was a model landlady and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not pat himself with the remark , " They will have to come to me yet . " He never even thought of that . Neither did he say , " I am doing a big thing , " having no opinion at all as to whether the thing was little or big . But he whistled sometimes as he worked , quite softly , and he went to bed always in a warm mellow glow that merged easily into sound restful sleep . In the morning he awoke ready , even eager , for the new day . He even took some pleasure in his work for Dick Holden . It was Dick who gave him a bit of interesting news . David had called that noon to get data for some plans Dick wanted him to make . " I could do them myself , " the latter explained . " But I 'm loafing this summer . I 'm in town only because there 's talk that St. Mark 's is going to build . " David did not wince . " And to pay tribute into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here for , " grinned Dick . " And what are you going to give them ? " " I do n't know . " Dick waved a confident hand . " Whatever they want . " " I 'm working out an idea , " David suggested a little timidly , " that maybe you can use . Drop around to my room some time and I 'll show it to you . " " Why , yes , I 'll drop around some time , " rather too carelessly said Dick , who was no longer so thoughtful in little things . Too much success seemed to be going to his head . David flushed and dropped the subject . Dick , too , dropped it , both from tongue and mind . A few evenings later , while David was working on his new idea , violin strains rose from the parlor . But he did not go down or join his fellow roomers on the stairs , though Jonathan and Esther made music until the evening was no longer young . It was a good hour for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his heart and clarified his vision . That evening he completed a first sketch of the interior : the picture you get looking toward the altar from a point well back in the nave . It was good even as a sketch , for he had seen very clearly and worked eagerly . When it was finished he sat back and looked at it for a long time while the music from the parlor flooded up to him . But he saw not a sketch . He was back in a simpler age when the symbols of faith had power ; seeing with a new understanding a picture that had formed in his mind as he worked out this creation  --  for him it was already created . . . . A narrow crooked street , filled by a gay colorful throng that slackened its pace and lowered its voice before a gray , weathered old church . A beggar crouching on the steps , mouthing his whining song . A constant stream of worshipers passing in and out through the great open door : plumed cavaliers , their arrogant swagger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dusty , with blistered feet and splintered staves ; mailed soldiers ready to march for the wars ; tired-eyed crusaders home from a futile quest ; a haughty lady , a troubled daughter of artisans , a faded wanton , brought into a brief gentle sisterhood by a common need ; all seeking the same thing . And perhaps in the doorway a faltering sinner unconfessed , fear of punishment a flaming sword in his path . . . . Ah , well ! It was not so absurd , that picture . For those seekers have even unto this day their children who , amid their pleasuring and warring and questing , sometimes grow faint and would rest . In such company he entered . On the threshold they paused with a quick breath for the chaste beauty of vista and line , the soft play of color and shadow . Then sense of beauty faded before a thing that eye can not see nor tongue express , what the seekers had needed and what they found : peace , passing understanding , unseen but undoubted ; hovering above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadowy aisle , winging toward them on the shaft of sunshine streaming from heaven itself upon the altar . Here , for intrigant and ravager , penitent and saint , failure and world-weary , was sanctuary  --  respite , if only for an hour , from sin and strife , passion and hate and self . It was good to stay there a while , humbled yet uplifted , aspiring anew . For there was a Presence in His own house . A wonderful thing had happened to David Quentin . His sensitive quivering heart had caught and recorded the great human need , and to him it had been given to build a rest house for many weary and poor in heart . Perhaps if his commonplace little trials had not seemed big and tragic to him , he never could have known the need and so he never would have written in stone and wood the story of sanctuary that has meant so much to the ages . He did not foresee that . He did not think of it as a possibility . He was thinking only of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may find sanctuary , as he may give worship , in a task well loved and well done . Life was a pretty good thing after all , since it could not take from him eyes to perceive or heart to rejoice in the beauty he could create , though none else cared to see . The days of his whimpering , even to himself , were ended . " I should have been doing this all along . " Nor did he notice that the music had ceased . He did not know even that he was no longer alone , until a voice broke in on his reverie . " He does n't look very hospitable , does he ? " " Maybe , " said another , " he does n't feel that way . " David jumped to his feet and peered over the easel at Jonathan and Esther . " But he does , indeed . Visitors , " he announced , " are requested to stay on this side of the door . " They stepped within . " Since you would n't come down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come up . Though Miss Summers almost lost her courage on the way . She said we were taking a liberty . " " But I did n't , " she protested in some confusion . " I only said  --  " " That you do n't seem to care much for company , " Jonathan completed her sentence . " She was mistaken , I trust ? " " Woefully , " smiled David . " And I 've had company all evening . They played and sang and helped me to work . " He waved a hand toward the easel . " Do you think , " Jonathan inquired of Esther , " we may take that as a compliment ? " " I 'm not quite sure , " she answered . " She means , " chuckled Jonathan , who seemed to be enjoying himself hugely , " she must see the work before she commits herself . Is it allowed  --  ? " " Of course , if you care to , " David said . " And you 'll find these chairs comfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the light . " When they had sat down , he turned the easel toward them . " Now , ladies and gentlemen , " he burlesqued , " if you will look upon my right  --  " They looked . And their sudden surprised interest made his heart skip a beat . " Why , I  --  I did n't know  --  " Esther began , in the words he had once stammered to her . She gave him a quick questioning glance , then looked again at the sketch . Jonathan had become very grave . " You have a gift for drawing . " " Only a knack , " said David . " A very pretty knack then . Is that a copy ? " " Just a sketch of an idea I 've been trying to work out lately . This , " David placed another drawing on the easel , " is about what it would be like outside . " " It is , " said Esther , " like seeing music . " Jonathan studied that drawing for several silent minutes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " he asked abruptly . " Oh , no ! But sometimes I  --  waddle for the fun of it . Under advice , " David smiled at Esther , " of a very good fairy . " Jonathan did not understand that saying , but he thought from her color he could guess the fairy 's name . " And very good advice , too . Have you done any other ecclesiastical work ? " " Why , that , " laughed David , " I used to think was my mission in life . " " Is there anything else you could show us ? " " I have a set of drawings I submitted to St. Christopher 's last spring . They 're all that escaped a general destruction when I took down my shingle . " David got the plans from a closet , unrolled them and placed the illustrative sketches before his visitors . Jonathan studied these drawings , too , very carefully . " St. Christopher 's , you say ? " he said at last . " But I do n't understand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know very much about architecture technically , but I should say yours are better  --  manifestly better . Am I right ? " " They were n't what St. Christopher 's wanted . " " But they are better , are n't they ? " " I think they are , " said David quietly . " But I believe I like the new idea even better . Am I right again ? " " I suppose it is better in a way . It 's less pretentious and spectacular , but has more warmth  --  more meaning , I suppose . " David tried to speak casually , but excitement was mounting . He caught up the new sketches and compared them eagerly with the old , forgetting for the moment what St. Christopher 's had meant to him . And he saw the new idea as he had not seen it before . " It is better , " he muttered . " I  --  I had n't realized . " " David ! " It was hard to believe that Jonathan could be so stern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me under false pretenses . You gave me to believe that you had been a failure . " " I was . " " You know better than that . Any man who can work out such things  --  ! For a very little I would give you your discharge this moment . " " But I beg of you  --  Mr. Radbourne , you do n't know what my position means to me  --  " " I did n't mean that seriously , of course . But you ought to be back in your own work . Why did you ever leave it ? " " Because I could n't make a good enough living . " David flushed as he said it . How pitifully poor , despite all his late philosophizing , that reason sounded ! " Mr. Radbourne , let us drop the subject . " But the shining-eyed Jonathan would not drop it . " I think I can understand , " he said gently . " Because it seemed the best thing for others , you gave up the work you wanted to do and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you did my little drudgeries well and patiently , as though they were the big things you would have done  --  " " You do n't understand . I did whine  --  " " I never heard you . Miss Summers , we owe David an apology . We were sorry for him ! " " Not now , " she said . " No , not now . David , how long will it take you to finish your new plans ? " " But I 'm not going to prepare plans . A few sketches for my own amusement  --  that 's all . " " I happen to know that St. Mark 's is about to build . " " I am not interested , Mr. Radbourne . " " But I am . As a member of St. Mark 's and as your friend , I am deeply interested . How long will it take , David ? " David only shook his head . " Man , " cried Jonathan , " will you let one reverse  --  " " Mr. Radbourne , I beg of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind me . I 'm not fitted for the work as you think  --  drawing pretty sketches is n't all of it . I  --  a man told me once , I have n't the punch . I do n't know how to meet competition . And it cost me something  --  it was n't easy  --  to get settled in other work . I do n't want to get unsettled again , to face another disappointment . I  --  " David stopped . And Esther , watching him too closely to be conscious of her own heart 's eccentric behavior , saw in his eyes the hurt which disappointment had left , and philosophy , even a very sound philosophy as formulated by a lame duckling , had not yet fully healed . And she saw indecision there , a longing that she understood , and a fear  --  Of its own accord her hand went toward him in a quick pleading little gesture . " You must ! " she said softly . " Please ! " . . . Jonathan had left , beaming with joy , violin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other . They stood on the porch in an intimate silence they saw no reason to break . A young half moon was sailing over the city , dodging in and out among lazy white cloudlets . David watched it and wondered if he and his friends had not been more than a little foolish . He shrank from the thought of another defeat . He shrank even from the thought of a victory ; for , should it come now , it would not be alone through his gift or any power that dwelt in him . " I believe you 're sorry you promised him . " He turned to the girl . The disappointment in her tone reached him . " He is n't hard to read , is he ? He 's planning to  --  to pull wires for me . He wo n't trust my work to win out . " " Ah ! I was hoping you would n't think of that . " " I ca n't help it . It sticks out  --  you 've thought of it yourself . Do you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " she answered quickly . " And not just pride , I think . It 's hard to realize that good work is n't always enough . " " Then you do n't think me  --  temperamental ? " " I think you are  --  honest . But after all , there 's no real dishonesty if you do good work . And I think "  --  there was a sudden return to her old shyness  --  " I think , if you win out , your great reward will be the good work you have done . " " How do you know that ? " " If it were n't true you would n't have made those sketches . " And he knew a quick stirring of gratitude that he had found this girl who understood so well , who saw the verities as he saw them and had neither laugh nor sneer nor impatience for his finickiness . " I wish , " she went on , " it could come to you as you want it . But I am glad it is coming  --  even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . " " But the wires may not work . I 've got to remember that others may not see my work as you and he do . " " That is possible , " she said . " What of that ? " " I can try again , you mean ? I suppose I can do that . I think I will do that , as I can . And probably , if I turn out work that 's worth while , some day my chance will come . If I do n't  --  why , there are other things to do , and if you put your heart into them you can get happiness out of them . Do you mind if I plagiarize a bit ? " " I do n't mind at all , " she smiled . " And I 've got to remember that , win or lose , I owe a lot to you and him . He does n't understand what a quitter I was when I came to his office . I 'd turned sour . I thought , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd been hardly used . " " I know how that feels , " she said . " The truth was  --  " Moonlight loosens tongues that by day are tied fast . " The truth was , I 'd had the best luck in the world . I 'd met him  --  and you . You went out of your way to make things pleasant for me , a stranger . And by just being yourselves you shamed me into looking at things from your point of view . It 's a very good point of view . I 'd rather have it now , I think , than build all the churches in Christendom . " The moonlight revealed the friendliness in her eyes . He could not fight down a new thrilling faith in his gift , in himself , in his strength to stand straight though he should fail again . " You 'd have found it by yourself , " she said . " If you 'd really been a quitter , if it had n't been in you , you could n't have found it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel . I feel the same way toward him . Is n't he the dear , funny little man ? " And that opened a fertile and profitable field . Jonathan 's ears must have burned a long while that night . CHAPTER VIII CERTAIN PLOTS Three good fairies had their heads together . One was an astute banker with a mouth delinquent borrowers hated to see , one was a woman who was known to be wise and one was a dinky little man with red whiskers . " The question before the house , " said Jim Blaisdell , " is , are we justified in playing politics to bolster up a young man we 're afraid ca n't stand on his merits ? I do n't fancy pulling wires  --  in church matters , that is . " " The question , " said Mrs. Jim , " is no such a thing . It is , whether we 're to let that insufferable Dick Holden give us another St. Christopher 's ? " " Or to help make a strong fruitful life ? " amended Jonathan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Jim , " though he is paying his debts . But Dick certainly is getting to be a conceited duffer . The ayes , " he sighed , " seem to have it . The next question is ways and means . Old Bixby 's method in St. X looks good to me . A conditional contribution  --  what do you say ? " " How much ? " inquired the practical Mrs. Jim . Jim took out an envelope , did sums in subtraction and division and held out the result to his wife . She took it from him , did a sum herself  --  in multiplication  --  and exhibited that result to him . " Woman , " he cried , " would you rob me ? I 'm no Standard Oil . " " It 's the least I can possibly consider , " she answered him firmly . " You ca n't expect to play good fairy without paying for the privilege . Now , Mr. Radbourne , what will you do ? " Jonathan , too , took out an envelope , wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote another and handed it doubtfully to Mrs. Jim . " Will that do , " he inquired , " for a starter ? " Mrs. Jim gave him a special smile . " That is something like . " She waved Jonathan 's figures under her husband 's nose . " There , Mr. Pinchapenny ! Are you blushing for shame ? " " Phew ! " whistled Jim . " If that 's how he squanders his money , he need n't ever come asking credit of me . " He grinned at Jonathan . " Davy must be a mighty poor workman , when you 'll pay so high to get rid of him . " " Oh , no , " Jonathan protested . " It will be very hard to fill his place  --  in one way entirely impossible . But , you see , Davy and I have become good friends , and  --  " " And of course , " Mrs. Jim put in sweetly , " in friendship one forgets one is a shaver of notes . " " Oh , my hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ match your figures , Radbourne . But , for heaven 's sake , do n't raise me again ! " " What I 'd like to know , " said Jim , when Jonathan was gone , " is , why we are going to the poorhouse for Davy Quentin ? " " First , " said his wife , " because we know Davy will do work that is worth while and because he is Davy . Second , because it is good for us to give a little out of our much . " " No one helped me when I was poor , " growled Jim . " That , " she explained , " was because you were known to have a talent for helping yourself  --  and because you married me , who am help enough for any man . " " There may be something in that , " Jim was forced to concede . " Shirley still at her aunt 's ? " " Yes . " " Hmmmm ! Mighty long visit . What 's she doing there ? " " Having a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Any trouble there , do you suppose ? " " No-o-o ! But Shirley keeps writing about ' poor David , who does n't seem to have the money-making knack '  --  with an air that says , ' Poor Shirley ! ' And when a woman begins to speak sadly of her husband 's flaws , it is time they were together again with all flaws repaired . Shirley being Shirley , it had better be in prosperity . " " Who 's going to repair Shirley 's flaws ? " " That 's part of the scheme . We must get her back somehow before she knows Davy 's plans are accepted . Then she will seem  --  " " I see . " said Jim dryly . " That may allow her time for a very long visit  --  a lifetime , in fact . But is n't there a theory that hard scratching is good for the soul ? " Mrs. Jim eyed her lord with contempt . " My dear Jim , you are old enough to know that no family ever came happily through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Besides , I 'm not trying to prove a theory , but to correct a mistake before it 's too late . " ( But of all this David never was told . ) The old witch must have gnashed her teeth in rage as , peeping through his windows , she saw her spell broken . There is a good fairy called Hard Work , and another hight , Hope , and both of these were standing guard . David must have been happy , because he never thought of happiness , its causes or effects . There was a new set to his jaw that meant far more  --  if you were looking for signs of the future  --  than the youthful enthusiasm once reflected on his face . So the witch , shrieking grisly maledictions , rode away to vent her spite on colicky babies and gouty old men . There was one thing the fairies could not guard against , perhaps because they had not been warned . Sometimes the witch perceived that David was not alone . Those occasions were not many : a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trifle , or lemonade and cookies , sweetened by the aunt 's good wishes , were carried to him . And sometimes he went down-stairs to listen to a song and to tell the singer that her high b-flat was unmistakably easier . There was no great harm in that , to be sure . But the witch , baleful creature that she was , took a hint and hatched a wicked plot . They had a bond , you see . They faced the same adventure . It did them good to compare notes of progress ; and an audience was needed if they were to make a jest of setbacks , such as a throat that seemed all burrs or an idea that had for the moment lost its charm . Also he needed some one to remind him that he took too little sleep and never exercised . He would have been wiser if he had listened . Instead , he laughed at her and said , " Work never kills , and in summer I always get thin . " But evidence of her concern always left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But she did not go away . Part of each day she spent in his room , putting it to rights and keeping it sweet and clean . She liked to do that , because he never failed to note the result of her labors or to thank her . When she had finished her sweeping and dusting , she would sit for an hour or more studying the sketches and plans he had left on easel or table . She thought it a marvel that a young man could think out a church so proportioned that its harmonies set one to dreaming and thinking , so devised that it would not fall down though the storms of centuries charged against it . And it was a relief to think of him and his work ; it took her mind from an ugly little fear lurking in her heart . Her throat did not always behave as a well-meaning throat should . Sometimes she studied also a new photograph on his mantel  --  of a pretty laughing-eyed young woman playing with a sailor-suited cherub . The young woman , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You are very pretty , " she would whisper . " Why do you stay away from him ? Do n't you know he is lonely , with no one to cheer him up but a funny little man  --  and me ? You 're the reason he gave up his own work . " She tried not to be prejudiced against Mrs. David Quentin . But she had a burning curiosity , which is a weakness of all women  --  and men . She mentioned the picture one evening , very casually . " This is your family , is it not ? " " Yes , " he said in a queer curt tone she had never heard him use . " She is very pretty , is n't she ? " " Yes . They are  --  spending the summer at an aunt 's . " " What a darling little boy ! " she said . Soon after she left , thinking , " I wonder why she is away from him ? It is n't a happy reason , I 'm sure . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " David was thinking much the same thing . The next day the picture was nowhere in evidence . When he went down-stairs one evening to tell her the plans were complete , she dissembled her excitement and said , " Now you 'll be able to get enough sleep . " But when , after a few minutes of gay nonsense , he had left her to take her advice , and she thought what success would mean to him , she became very grave and had her first taste of a suspense that grew heavier with each waiting day . . . . The blind woman was first to see . There was another dinner at Jonathan 's house , by way of celebration of the plans ' completion , with music , most of which came from his violin . Esther sung only twice , because that was one of the days when the throat behaved ill . " I 've been working it a little too hard , " she explained . Between times they were very gay . It seemed to Jonathan that his guests were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though the lids drooped over the poor sightless eyes . She was listening . But not to the music or jests . And she was seeing , through a sense that only blind people have . When Jonathan came back from his walk with his guests to the trolley , she was waiting for him . He began to pace back and forth across the room . She listened closely to the quick staccato tread . " You seem very happy over something , Jonathan . " " I am . " She did not need eyes to know that he was beaming . " Did you notice that they both seemed in better spirits than usual ? " " I noticed . " " They are coming into their own . I ca n't help feeling that our ventures are coming out well . It will be something to have helped them a little . There are compensations , you see  --  " He caught himself abruptly . " Compensations for what ? " " Oh , for all the things , " Jonathan said vaguely , " that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Even for giving your life to the care of a helpless , uninteresting old woman ? " " Hush , mother ! " He reached her in a twinkling and patted the fine silver of her hair . " You know better than that . " " I know what you have given up for me . It is only lately that I have begun to understand . Oh , Jonathan  --  " " But think what I 've gained by staying with you ! There have never been any regrets . " " You have been a good son . " But her smile was very faint . " Do you like David Quentin as well as ever ? " " Yes . " " Why ? " " There are no ' whys ' in friendship , mother . " " Does he return your friendship in equal degree , do you think ? " His answer was without hesitation . " No . " She was silent . " That is not to be expected , of course , " he said simply . " I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to be forced . " She lifted her face and the poor lifeless eyes seemed to be straining to see him . " I am just beginning to know my son . Ah ! if I could see you  --  only once ! I would ask nothing more . " Her hands reached toward his face . But he caught them and held them gently . " Why do you never let me touch your face ? " He mustered a laugh . " I 'm afraid you would be disappointed . You know , your hands have seen David , and  --  " " Ah ! " she breathed . " Always your David ! Jonathan  --  " She paused sharply . " Yes ? " " Jonathan , there is a Mrs. David Quentin , is there not ? " " Yes . " " Where is she now ? " " Visiting relatives , I believe . " " It is a strangely long visit , do n't you think ? In my time husbands and wives lived together . " " It is an arrangement for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It seems David had got into debt . " " I should think , " she said slowly , " Mrs. Quentin would find it economical to return . " " Mother ! " Jonathan started . " Just what do you mean ? " " Her husband and you find Miss Summers quite agreeable , do you not ? " " Mother , " he reproved her gently , " you should not even hint such a thing . David is a man of honor . " " Say he is a man  --  and stop there . A presentable young man whom people seem to like and whose wife has been long away . And Miss Summers is an attractive young woman who has been thrown much with him . . . . I have seen what I have seen . " " Mother ! " Jonathan stood stiffly , as though he had been turned to stone . " Oh , that is impossible . You are unjust . It is n't like you to be so suspicious . There is nothing between them but a friendly attachment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps . But  --  oh , my poor blind son ! Jonathan , sit here beside me . " He went to her and sat down by her side . She took both his hands . And her voice was very gentle . " You are in love with her , are you not ? " " Yes , " he said . " Then press your suit quickly , my son . " " But I ca n't  --  you must see that . I am her employer . She is dependent on me . It would put her in a distressing position . " " I approve of your delicacy . Not many men display it in these greedy days , I am told . But delicacy can be carried to excess . Women love to be wooed strongly , masterfully . I remember how your father  --  " " My father was equipped for masterfulness . I , " he smiled sadly , " am not . " " You are small , I know , like me . I had hoped my son would be tall . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been great and strong . " " You do n't understand . Mother , you have been blessed  --  you have never had to look on your son . That is why I never let you touch my face . I am more than merely small . I am ugly . I am ridiculous . I am almost grotesque . People smile in amusement when they see me and never take me seriously . " " Does she smile in amusement when she sees you ? " " No . She is too big-hearted for that . She is gentle and kind and friendly , because she is a little sorry for me and because she thinks mistakenly that she has reason to be grateful . As a friend , a helper , I am tolerable . As a lover I should only be absurd . See , mother , for yourself  --  this once ! " He lifted her sensitive hands and guided them over his face . " My nose  --  my ears  --  my little pig 's eyes  --  this grinning mouth  --  these silly whiskers that hide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands quickly away . " You are a gentleman , a fine , great-hearted gentleman  --  " " With a face like a comic valentine . Even my mother ca n't say no to that . What woman wants a comic valentine for her lover ? Do n't you understand now ? I can have her friendship now and be with her a little . And I can do little things to help her . I ca n't risk losing that to seek something she never could give . " " But she could have given it once . I know it . I knew it then , but I would n't tell you because I wanted to keep you for myself . He  --  your friend David  --  had not come then . You must take the risk for her sake . And before it is too late . " " But I ca n't inflict myself on her . It would be no kindness to her or to me . " He left her and began to pace back and forth agitatedly , in the pompous , hopping little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong . It is impossible . It would be terrible , tragic even though they are both good . And it would be my fault . I brought them together , thinking she would help make things cheerful for him . . . . Mother , I wish you had n't put this in my mind ! I ca n't believe it . I wo n't believe it . He is honorable  --  " The blind woman smiled sadly . " It is a thing with which honor or duty or law has nothing to do . And I fear  --  I fear it is already too late  --  because I kept silent when I should have opened your eyes . " But Jonathan was not listening . He was seeing the faces of his friends as they had been that evening . The scales were falling from his eyes , an evil black fear entering into his heart . " Oh , Jonathan , my son  --  my dear son  --  " She held out her hands to him and he went to her and knelt at her side . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , and he bowed his head on her knee . CHAPTER IX A NEW HOUSE Radbourne &amp; Company was in a daze . And no wonder ! For a week the " little boss " had not once beamed , the spirited hop had gone out of his walk , a new querulous note had come into his voice . When a matter went wrong  --  which , it seemed , happened oftener than usual  --  he reminded the delinquent of the fact , not gently , but sadly , as though deeply aweary of the frailty of men . Miss Brown confided to Esther that she was well on the way to " nervous prostration . " Esther was worried , and wondered what grave mischance could have worked out such a change in Jonathan . He seemed to avoid both her and David , and when they did meet his manner was constrained and awkward . It was like chicken-pox and evil gossip and other contagious diseases . It spread . Gloom hung like a fog over office and shop . No one whistled or hummed at work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And Hegner , the shop foreman , who had been sober for a year , lost his grip and got drunk . Because he was ashamed and hated himself , his temper was always at half-cock . And Smith  --  poor Smith , the ex-convict , to whom Jonathan 's kindness had been as water on a lame duck 's back  --  had to bear the brunt of Hegner 's distemper . He stood it as long as he could ; which was not very long . One noon hour he presented himself , sullen and whining and bleeding at the nose , with a grievance for Jonathan 's ears . The latter looked up frowningly from the pile of letters he was signing ; they were sadly misspelled , the agitated Miss Brown having been at her worst . " Yes , Smith , " he said wearily . " What is it ? A complaint , I suppose ? " " I wants to know , " began Smith in a whine , " why I ca n't git a square deal here . The shop boss he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then go bring him here and say what you have to say before him . " Smith departed , to return a few minutes later , an apprehensive eye cast back at the trailing Hegner . " Now , Smith , " said Jonathan , " what is your complaint ? " " The boss he keeps damnin ' me up an ' down all the time , " Smith explained . " An ' this morning he slugs me  --  right here on the beak . " He laid a gentle finger on the corpus delicti . " Hegner , " inquired Jonathan , " why do you keep damning him up and down all the time ? And why did you slug him on the beak ? " " Because , " Hegner grinned sheepishly , " his beak was the place most convenient . " " This is n't a joking matter , " Jonathan reminded him sharply . " So it ai n't . " Hegner turned a glance of contempt on Smith . " He 's a bum an ' a loafer , He wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why , Braun , who 'd ought to be in bed instead of at a lathe , turns out half as much again as him . How can I jack the other men up if I let him lag behind ? An ' this morning I told him I 'd had enough of his soldierin ' an ' what I thought he was good for . He hauled off with a steelson to crack me  --  but I beat him to it . That 's all . " Hegner blew tenderly on his knuckles . " Smith , " said the judge , " what have you to say to that ? " " ' Tai n't so . He 's only huntin ' an excuse to fire me an ' give some one else my lathe . " " So I am , " Hegner put in grimly . " Some one who 'll work an ' who ai n't an ex  --  " " Hegner , hold your tongue ! " Jonathan turned to Smith . " I have to believe Hegner , because I 've been watching you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I told you at the time , not to do you a favor , but because I thought you were in earnest and would justify it . I was willing to be your friend . And you soldiered . You stole the time I paid you for , which is the same as stealing my money . And you stole something else  --  my trust  --  which is worth more to me than my money . But I suppose that is something you ca n't understand . " " I un'erstan 's when I ai n't wanted , " answered Smith , with an ugly laugh . " I 'll git my time an ' git out . " Then Jonathan 's trouble found voice in a sharp querulous outburst . " Yes , get your time . I 'm tired keeping men who wo n't help themselves . " Smith vanished , and his surly ugly face was only the reflection of the ugliness just then in his heart . " You , too , Hegner ! " Jonathan turned blazing eyes on his foreman . " You 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You ai n't more disgusted than me . " Big Hegner , ashamed , looked down at his feet . " But I could n't help it . Honest , I could n't . Everything 's been goin ' wrong here for a week . " Jonathan 's outburst ended as suddenly as it began . " I know , " he said wearily . " I know . " An hour later David , seeking Jonathan on a matter that was only a pretext , found him idle , elbows on the desk and head propped in his hands . Jonathan looked up listlessly . The matter disposed of , David ventured , uncertainly , because he had learned the last week to remember that he was an employee as well as a friend . " Mr. Radbourne , are you ill ? " " No . " " I 'm afraid something 's wrong . " " Something 's wrong , David . " " I hope it is something that can be easily mended . " " I 'm afraid it ca n't . " Jonathan looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been done . Will you please go to the shop and see if Smith is anywhere around ? " David departed , to return with the word that Smith was gone . " Ah ! I 'm sorry . I owe him an apology and some amends . A little while ago I lost my temper and did him an injustice , when he needed to be helped . I had no excuse . But it hurts to be disappointed in a man . " Jonathan looked queerly at David again . " In any one , David . " " I have found that out , " answered David . Jonathan picked up some papers . " If you will excuse me now  --  I have some work  --  " David took the hint promptly , with the feeling that somehow he had been the one to disappoint his friend . That hurt as deeply as it puzzled . That afternoon Jonathan went out for two hours . When he returned he summoned Esther to his office . " Miss Summers , " he began abruptly , " how is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You must be afraid of nothing , " he interrupted . " I 'm afraid , " she repeated quietly , " I have come to a standstill . Some days I feel as if I could sing forever , then the very next day one easy little song will seem too much . And if I am in a draft for a minute or get caught in a shower , my throat gets sore and hoarse at once . It does n't seem to get any stronger . " " Probably it wo n't until you do the right thing . I took the liberty of talking to Doctor Jenkins . He says the trouble is all with your general health . You 'll have to build it up . So  --  so you must get away from this office , that takes up your time and strength , and live as much as possible outdoors and grow strong . " " But I ca n't do that . I ca n't afford it and I ca n't impose on my aunt . " " Could you afford it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes . But I 'm not ready for that . I could n't fill it . No church would want me , with a voice so uncertain  --  " " The Second Presbyterian is looking for a new contralto . I have asked them to give you a trial . Will you sing for them ? " " When ? " " At the vespers service next Sunday afternoon . " " But I ca n't do that . It 's too soon . It would n't be fair to them , even if I should sing well at the trial . I  --  I 'm afraid I 've been letting you expect too much  --  " Her face had grown whiter than usual . " But you can . " Jonathan was very earnest . " You must believe  --  you must believe you can . You must make up your mind to sing your very best next Sunday . If they hear you at your best , they 'll be glad to have you , even if your voice is a little uncertain at first . And you must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my work here is n't good enough  --  that you want to get rid of me ? " " Not that ! " Jonathan almost gasped . He looked down at his desk and nervously ruffled his whiskers . " Oh , not that ! I shall  --  miss you very much . And if you ever want to come back , there 's a place waiting for you . But I want you to have your career  --  everything that is best for you . And "  --  he raised his eyes to her again and they joined his tongue in the plea  --  " wo n't you try it for  --  for my sake ? " She looked away quickly , a sudden catch in her throat . And though her heart was filled with dread for herself , it was aching , too , for the little man  --  not so absurd to her just then  --  part of whose secret she had seen . " I will try it , " she said . . . . Of course she told David that evening . ( How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans was done , they had drifted into those little evening chats ! ) He had a moment of grave doubt . His face showed it . " Do you think I ca n't make it ? " Doubt vanished on swift wings . " I think nothing of the sort . And you must n't think of it , either . You must believe you can . It is half the battle . Hear me preach ! " he laughed . " That 's what he  --  Mr. Radbourne  --  said . " " He was right , as always . This is very exciting . Do you know , I 've a feeling you 're going to knock ' em galley-west . And that , " he nodded gaily down at her , " and that would be the finest thing that could happen . " " You forget your church , " she smiled back . " So I did ! But now I remember it , I have nothing whatever to take back . " The witch chuckled as only witches can and sent her broomstick steed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw Esther and her aunt away that Sabbath afternoon with a jest  --  an extravagant salute and an " Up , lass , an ' at ' em ! " to which she made answer with a determined smile . When they had been perhaps five minutes gone , he put on his hat and followed . He found a seat in the rear of the church and waited , nerves strung taut as if the ordeal were his , wishing the services would begin and yet dreading it . His eyes swept the gathering worshipers idly until they happened upon a familiar face across the church , a homely face set sternly rigid toward the choir loft . " He would be here , of course , " David mused . " In a way , if ever she makes good , her success will be his . It will be because he has given it to her . " A nameless little regret followed that . But before he could give it a name the organ burst into the prelude and the choir filed into the loft . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others . The second was a trio in which she did not sing . The offertory solo was hers . So , while the organ softly played the theme , she rose and faced her ordeal . The late afternoon sun was streaming through the tall west window . One amber shaft reached out and enfolded her caressingly , vivifying the white girlish face : a picture he has to this day . " By the waters of Babylon . . . . " For a breath fear clutched at his heart . In those first few notes was a weak quaver , a huskiness that ought not to have been there . His whole body grew tense with effort as mind and heart sent winging to her a silent message . " You must not fear ! You must believe ! " Another was sending her the same word . But David had forgotten him . One of those messages must have reached its mark , for of a sudden her voice grew true and steady and clear , shaken only by the poignant grief of her song . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a girl singing as he had never heard it the exile 's plaint . David did not quite know her . Up there in the loft , bathed in the mellow radiance that had singled her out as if in prophecy , letting out to the full , as she could not in the little parlor , a voice of power and passion to thrill multitudes , she did not seem the girl who had made music for him , who had offered him friendship in his loneliness . She had grown as the occasion of her song had grown ; she had become one of the custodians of great talents , set apart to keep alive and reveal the harmonies that men through centuries had been hearing and recording . Quivering with joy in her triumph , he was abashed as well . He had too easily accepted the friendship , so naively tendered . He had not appraised it justly . . . . And then there was only the song . He was a captive in a strange land and the ache of the exiled was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Babylon we sat down and wept . " He realized at last that she had ended . The ordeal was over ; she had passed through unscathed . He leaned back and smiled at the imprints of nails in his palms . His eyes grew wet , but not with the exile 's tears . . . . When they had cleared , without his bidding they turned to where Jonathan sat , whiskers crushed upon his breast . It was a wonderful world through which David walked homeward that Sabbath evening . He went by a roundabout way , that he might miss none of it . He thrilled with a sense of victory , a song of thanksgiving was in his heart . And from that he should have known what had happened to him . But he was to have that hour perfect . She was sitting on the porch when he came in sight of the house . She may have been waiting for him . He quickened his pace . He stood before her , smiling down into her shining eyes . " A question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain song  --  I think I can never forget it . Are you by any chance the singer ? " " As it happens , I sang a little this afternoon . " " Then the finest thing in the world has happened . " " Did I do pretty well ? " " Pretty well ? Hmmm ! " he considered the matter judicially . " Yes , I think I may safely say that . " She laughed as though he had been very witty , then quickly became grave . " Were you thinking hard for me at the first , when I almost fizzled ? " " The hardest I knew how . I was afraid you were losing your nerve . " " I was . I never was so scared in my life . It came over me all at once that the next few minutes would probably decide everything for me , and I could see only strangers  --  critical strangers who would n't care . Then I saw you sitting back there and  --  and then I could sing . Thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm sure . " He laughed at her thanks . " Did you think for a minute that I could stay away ? And are you aware that we have never shaken hands ? It is really high time . Would you mind ? " Her smile was sunshine itself . " With all my heart . " She put out her hand . He took it and held it . And he dropped it and stood looking strangely at his own hand . For it was tingling deliciously . And at her touch and the look that went with it his heart had burst into a sudden mad singing  --  a song not of exile or thanksgiving , but of a longing to which he might never give tongue . The hand fell slowly to his side . With an effort he lifted his glance to her questioning , startled eyes . He tried to make his voice easy and natural , but it was heavy and stiff . " I  --  I congratulate you . I hope  --  I know  --  to-day is only the beginning of many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and left her . In his room , when the first daze had cleared a little , he set himself sternly to face this new thing . For he knew now why the old sense of loss  --  of the dream woman shrunk to a wife to whom love was only a bauble to be worn in fair weather  --  and why the failure of love had ceased to trouble , why Shirley had drifted so quickly , so easily into the shadowy background of his life . He saw what had helped him to win his new brave philosophy , had builded the walls of his sanctuary . His poor sanctuary ! What refuge could it offer now ? Another house of his building lay about him , a grim hopeless ruin . " Oh , Esther ! " he whispered to the girl he might not have . " Oh , Esther ! " He sat there , trying to see what he must do . Darkness fell . But he wanted no light . He did not stir until late in the evening chords from the piano reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice , athrob with pain , floated up to him . " By the waters of Babylon we sat down and wept . . . . " CHAPTER X AT THE DOOR But Shirley was a fact . By morning  --  no sleep came to him that night  --  he had decided what he must do about that fact . It was then not a very complex problem . He took a lightly packed bag with him to the office and at the first opportunity presented himself to Jonathan . " May I take to-morrow off ? There is a matter I must attend to at once . I can be back by day after to-morrow . " " Certainly , " said Jonathan , without looking up . " Thank you . " David hesitated . " Mr. Radbourne , do you know anything definite of the situation at St. Mark 's ? " " Nothing definite . " " Do you think there 's any chance for me at all ? " " The committee will decide this week . There 's a man named Holden  --  " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence  --  and not much else . But Mr. Blaisdell is trying to see that you get fair play . " " Is it necessary for Mr. Blaisdell to use his influence very actively in my favor ? " " I 'm afraid it is . " " I 'm sorry . I knew , of course , that you and he would do all you could  --  if it was needed . But I thought perhaps my plans would justify the committee  --  " " They do . And they justify any work that has been done for you . There is no obligation that need weigh heavily on you . " " It is n't that . I appreciate my  --  my friends ' willingness to help . But I 'd hoped to be able to win solely on my merits in this thing . " " Do you wish us  --  Mr. Blaisdell to refrain ? " " No . I need to get back into my profession . It means so much to me  --  in a new way  --  that I 'll be glad to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not grateful for the kindness I 've had here .  --  But I 'm interrupting . " And David went back to his drawing . All that day he avoided Esther , sticking close to his table . Not until she was leaving at the end of the afternoon did he seek her . " Miss Summers , I forgot to tell your aunt that I sha n't be back until day after to-morrow . Will you please tell her for me ? " " You are going away ? " " Yes . " He made no explanation . " I will tell her . " " Thank you . " And because he was holding himself sternly rigid , lest eyes or tone cry out what must not be said , he spoke almost curtly . She moved quietly away from him and did not once look back , though she knew he was watching her . But when a door was between them she stopped for a moment , quivering lips pressed hard , both hands tightly clenched . Then she , too , sought Jonathan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I can have the position . " " I am very glad . When shall you be leaving the office ? " " At the end of the week , if you can get some one for my place . " " So soon ! I  --  " " I will stay as long as I 'm needed , of course . " " Oh , no ! You 're quite right to go at once . I can get some one to do your work . But not to take your place . I shall  --  " Jonathan seemed deeply interested in the crystal paperweight on his desk . " We shall miss you very much . " " I have n't thanked you  --  " " Please do n't thank me for anything . I have done nothing any one could not have done . It is , " he said huskily , " it is to my happiness , my great happiness , if I have been able to help you a very little . " Then he looked up and saw her face . " Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you standing . You must sit down , and let me get you  --  " " It is nothing at all . " She forced a smile to her lips . " It is only the reaction from yesterday . The ride home in the car is all I need . Good night , Mr. Radbourne . " " You are quite sure  --  " " Oh , yes . Quite all right , Mr. Radbourne . " " Good night , Miss Summers . " And when she was gone , he sat down and took a small mirror from a drawer and looked long and sadly at what it recorded . Suddenly he dropped the mirror and bowed his head on the desk . " Esther ! " It was almost a sob . " If only I could help you now ! " . . . David walked the next morning from the station to Aunt Clara 's house . He walked slowly , because Aunt Clara lived on a hill and because he dreaded facing Shirley . But he did not have to face her at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , filled almost to overflowing , roll down the driveway and turn up the street ; and Shirley was one of the party . She did not notice her unexpected visitor . But as he turned into the grounds he met a little sailor-suited cherub in tow of a nurse who did not know David . He dropped his bag and squatted before the child . " Hello , old man ! Are n't you going to shake hands ? " Davy Junior clung tightly to the nurse 's skirt , put one chubby finger into his rosebud mouth and stared , round-eyed , at the big man . " He 's always that way with strangers , " the nurse explained . " Oh ! " David winced and stood up . " He 's forgotten me , then . When he has had his walk please bring him to the house . I 'd like to get acquainted with him again . I 'm his father , you know . " He picked up his bag and went on to the house . A few minutes later he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in astonishment and offered her cheek for a kiss . " This is a surprise . Shirley 's out , too . They 're gone for a picnic and wo n't be back until dark . " " Yes . I saw them start out . How is she ? " " Shirley 's quite well . And seemingly enjoying herself . " " I suppose so , " he said . " And the boy , too . " " Yes . I just saw him . He  --  " David cleared his throat . " He did n't know me . " " That 's to be expected . Children forget easily . You 're not looking well yourself . " " I 've been working pretty hard of late . " " Are you on your vacation ? " Aunt Clara was studying him curiously . " No . I have just to-day . I came to get Shirley to come back . " " Are you out of debt then ? " " Not quite . " " You 've had a raise ? Or has something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little raise . Nothing else has happened  --  that I can count on . But we can get along nicely now , thanks to your help . " " For which you 're not thankful at all , " she smiled grimly . " It was a mistake . " " Humph ! " she sniffed . " Have you lived with Shirley four years without learning that she ca n't stand  --  " " Suppose , " he interrupted quietly , " suppose we do n't criticize Shirley . I sha n't criticize you , either . I blame myself for letting her come here . Now we 're going to correct that mistake . " Aunt Clara sniffed again . " What has got into you ? You used to have no more spirit than a mouse . Now you remind me of your late Uncle John in some of his moods . Suppose Shirley thinks it better  --  sniff  --  to stay here a while longer ? If you 're not out of debt you 'll still have to pinch pennies and  --  " He interrupted again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is best . She must come  --  before it is too late . " " What do you mean by that  --  ' before it is too late ' ? " " I mean  --  while I still want her to come . " " Eh ? " Aunt Clara stared sharply at him . She put on her spectacles , that she might stare more effectively . Then a light broke in on her , a light too incredible , too dazing even for Aunt Clara 's confident mind . " Eh ? David Quentin ! Do you mean to tell me  --  do you mean  --  there is another woman ? Who is she ? " He made no answer , but though his tired face went even whiter , steadily withstood her gaze . " Such a thing never happened in our family before , " Aunt Clara gasped weakly , " that I ever heard of . I do n't know what to do about it . " " There is only one thing , " he said steadily . " Shirley must come back at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rubbed them mechanically and donned them again . Her hands fell nerveless to her lap . " I do n't know what to do , " she repeated . " For the first time in all my existence . I  --  I have no precedents . You must leave me for a while until I can think this out . " He rose . " You ca n't think it out . I have tried . " " You 'd better lie down and get some sleep . You 're looking quite badly . " " No . I 'll go out and find David Junior . " " Perhaps that would be better . " He went . For an hour Aunt Clara sat alone , trying to work out the hardest problem of life , how to raise a love from the dead . And all she achieved was a bitter self-reproach . For the first time in all her existence . A ripple of childish laughter came to her through an opened window . She rose and looked out . She saw the Davids , little and big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thanked God that David and Shirley had been given a son . " We have that much to start with  --  though it seems little enough just now . " She sniffed , as a matter of necessity , and hastily reached for her handkerchief . When it was time for Davy Junior 's dinner and nap she summoned David to her sitting-room again . " David , " she began , very meekly for Aunt Clara , " I 've been thinking it over . I ought to blame you . But I ca n't . I 've had all I could do blaming myself . Are you thinking I am a selfish , meddlesome old fool ? " David shook his head wearily . " But I am . I was lonesome alone here in this big old house and I really thought  --  But never mind that now . Does she  --  that other woman know ? " " I think not . " " Is she  --  is she in love with you ? " " Oh , no ! That is impossible . Oh , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It would be too terrible . " " It 's terrible enough as it is . Are you going to tell Shirley ? " " That would n't help matters , would it ? " " I suppose not , " she sighed . " David , you must be very gentle with her . It is n't her fault she wanted to run away from hard times . All her life we have spoiled her , her father and mother and Maizie and I. I did it worst of all , as I never spoiled my own child . David , come over here . " He went to the chair beside her and she reached for his hand very awkwardly . " Oh , David , it 's going to be very hard for you  --  all because an old fool  --  " Aunt Clara was crying now , noisily and unbeautifully because she had had little practise . " And I 'm afraid that when you see Shirley you 'll find it even harder than you thought . " . . . Shirley came only a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train . He was playing on the library floor with Davy Junior when an automobile came to a panting stop before the house . A minute later came Shirley 's voice from the hall , " Da-vy ! " The little fellow scrambled to his feet and ran to meet her at the door . She caught him and swung him strongly in her arms , hugging and kissing him . And David saw that the months had been kind to Shirley . The marks of worry and discontent had been erased , her eyes danced and her cheeks glowed with health and pleasure . Oh , a very fair picture was Shirley , in the full flower of her loveliness . But his heart went not one beat faster for her . Then she saw him and set the child down . " David ! " And she ran to him and kissed him  --  very prettily , as a loving wife should . " And now , " said Aunt Clara , " I will say good-by to David and leave you alone to the last minute . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She held up her cheek to David and left them . Shirley gasped . " You 're not going to-night ? " " In a few minutes . I must . " " But  --  but this is ridiculous . Surely you can stay overnight at least . " " No . I promised to be back to-morrow morning . My time is n't my own . " Which was not quite fair to Jonathan in its implication . " Why did n't you let me know you were coming ? " " I did n't think of it until this morning when I got here and saw you going out . I supposed I should find you . " " Surely you 're not piqued because I  --  David , what is it ? " A look of dread came into the dancing eyes . " You 're looking wretchedly . You 're not going to tell me we 've had some more bad luck ? " " I hope , " he said quietly , " you wo n't call it that I came to ask you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I  --  " It was no glad eager light that took the place of dread . It was consternation , a manifest , involuntary shrinking from what he asked . . . . Then she was in like case with him . He had not counted on that . He felt his heart turning hard and cold ; and that was not the way of the gentleness he had planned . He , too , had shrunk from what he asked ; yet he had not hesitated to ask it , thinking to save her from some hurt . She , without the key , thought only of the loss of her good times . He could tell her the whole truth and she would not care  --  if it led to good times . Could n't she see , could n't she feel , the tragedy in this end of their once pretty romance ? Since she could not , why try to save her from a hurt she would never really know ? Yet he went on , though not just as he had planned . " So you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to go back , Shirley ? " " That 's foolish . Of course I do . But  --  but the debts are n't paid yet . " " Pretty nearly . If we 're careful we can clean them up quickly now . " " But it seems so foolish  --  and so unnecessary . We could wait a little longer . The salary is so small at best . How  --  how should we live ? " " Very simply , I fear . But , " he added , in the same even , repressed tone , " always within our means , I 'm sure . We 'll go to a boarding-house first and then look around for an apartment we can afford . We 'll be starting over again , Shirley . " " But  --  " She was still stammering . " But it 's been so good for Davy here . And the weather 's still warm  --  " " That 's only an excuse , I think . And it 's a risk he 'll have to take . It 's better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other risks ? Since we 've waited so long , what difference would a few weeks more make ? " She did not guess what a temptation she was putting before him . It would be so easy to make this a fork in the road from which he and she should take different ways forever , in the end leaving him free , and at little cost to her ! But he fought that thought sternly . " Shirley , ca n't you see what has happened to us ? We 've been drifting apart . We 're very far apart now . You do n't really want to come back at all . And I  --  I could easily say , ' Then do n't come . ' I 'm capable of that just now . And you would n't really care . " " How can you say such a thing ? Of course , I would care . I do n't understand  --  " " You would n't care or you would have come of your own accord . Shirley , I came here to coax you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it all means to you . But  --  You 've mentioned Davy . We 've got to think of him . " He looked down at the child playing between them . " I want the boy , Shirley  --  and I want you with him . " There was an edge to his voice that she had never heard . " But I would n't think of leaving him . I  --  I was going back  --  When ? " " As soon as I can find temporary quarters for us . " " You say  --  I must ? " " I do n't say that . I say only , if you are coming at all , come while I want you . " They faced each other in silence , the pretty , pleasure-loving young woman to whom life had been only a house of toys , and the rather seedy young man who had been one of the toys . The bond that held them was a slight one ; a little more strain and it would have snapped . But the toy man had grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not want to let go , and she knew that , as he had said , he had got far away from her . She could not understand ; still she had not the key . And she was afraid . " David ! What is it I feel about you ? You do n't think  --  oh , you ca n't think  --  I do n't love you ? " " I suppose you think you do . But it 's not much of a love . " A clock struck . He had forgotten his train . " Let me know if you want to come . I 've got to go now . " He caught up the boy and held him close , then kissed her hastily . And before she quite realized it , he was gone . Aunt Clara found her standing where he had left her , staring blankly at the door , unmindful of the little David tugging at her dress . " Aunt Clara ! What is it ? What has happened ? David has been talking about  --  about my never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to what had been said . And she had been doing some more thinking of her own . " Between us we 've nearly lost you a husband . That 's what has happened . And you 're going to pack up and pack off to win him back , for his sake if not your own . That 's what is going to happen . " " Win him back ! " Shirley 's world was fast sinking from under her feet . " Is  --  is that what Mrs. Jim has been hinting in her letters ? Do you mean  --  you think David has stopped  --  loving me ? " " You think it incredible ? " " But he 's my husband . " " What 's that got to do with it ? Oh , " cried Aunt Clara , " ca n't you get it into your silly , selfish little head that you ca n't keep a love without earning it ? You 've been a fool . And I 've been another . I never was so foolish in my life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his grave . Come , Davy , it 's most nine o'clock . To bed with you and leave your mother to think for once in her life . " CHAPTER XI THE WITCH LAUGHS David was at his desk early the next day , working closely in the effort to shut out his own problems ; it was not a very successful effort . All morning he avoided Esther strictly ; that was much easier . She was avoiding him , too , but he did not guess that . During the noon hour he had a caller ; Dick Holden , if you please , a Dick who was plainly perturbed . " Davy , " quoth he , " have I done you some favors ? " " You have , " said David . " One good turn deserves another . It has to do with St. Mark 's . Something queer 's stirring there . My wires wo n't work . You 're pretty thick with Jim Blaisdell . Get him to put in a word , a good strong word , for me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't , Dick , " said David , " very consistently . " " Why not ? " " The fact is , I think Jim is putting in his best words for me . " " What do you mean by that ? " " I have plans in there myself . " " The devil ! " Dick stared . " I thought you were out of the game . " " I 'm back in to this extent . " " Why did n't you tell me ? " " I did n't suppose you would be interested . " " Are your plans any good ? " " I think so , " said David . " Then I bet you 're the one that 's blocking me there . " Dick shook his head reproachfully . " Davy , I 'm disappointed in you . I call it playing it low down on me . You might at least have told me , so I could know what to meet . It is n't fair . It is n't friendly . And after all I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it . " Dick sighed sorrowfully , his faith in human nature evidently shattered . " I 'm sorry , Dick , " said David . " I supposed you put all your faith in your wires . " Dick thought a few minutes . " Well , I 'll tell you what we 'll do , " he offered at last . " When friends find themselves competing , they should meet half-way . We 'll pool on your plans  --  I 'll take a chance on them , sight unseen . I 'll throw my pull over to you . Then we 'll split the spoils , two and one . The two to me , of course . " " Why the two to you  --  of course ? " " The prestige of my name , " said Dick with dignity , " is worth something , I think . We 'll have to get busy at once , because the committee meets this afternoon . " " I 'm afraid , Dick , I 'll have to say no . You had a chance at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You could have had them for almost nothing , but you did n't think them worth looking over . I think I 'll stand or fall with them . " " That 's final ? After all I 've  --  " " Yes , Dick , final . But it does n't mean I 'm not grateful  --  " With a gesture Dick waived that . " Very well , " he said sadly , rising . " I thought there was such a thing as friendship in business . I see I was mistaken . " David wondered if Dick were losing his punch . That afternoon came a wire . " Am packing up now . Love . Shirley . " He tore the yellow paper slowly to bits . " Poor Shirley ! " he muttered . Poor Shirley , with her house of toys ! Frightened now , no doubt , into thinking that she wanted what she did not really want , as he had been driven , by resentment at her blindness , into saying what he did not really mean . She at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She would be content with the hollow pretense their life together would be , missing only her good times . But he must have her beside him , to remind him that he was not free and never should be free to go browsing in the green fields of love . She would never know . Still , poor Shirley  --  none the less ! He set wearily to work once more . The afternoon came to an end somehow . The clamor of machinery from the shop was stilled . The other offices became silent . He supposed the others had gone . A janitor made the rounds , closing the windows . Doggedly David stuck to his table until he had completed the design he was working on . Then he put the table in order for the night , donned his hat and coat and started to leave . But the corridor door of the adjoining office was open . He looked in  --  and saw Esther , hatted , but still on her high stool by the desk , looking out into the street . She heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , I thought every one was gone . " " Yes , I thought so , too . " They fell silent , awkwardly silent . The easy comradeship was no more . Then she smiled ; no one but David could have told that the smile was forced . " I was just thinking  --  is n't it funny ?  --  that I 'll be sorry to say good-by to that dingy , rackety street . I 'll hate to leave this office . I 've been here two years and  --  " " You are leaving , then ? I did n't know . " " Yes . At the end of the week . " He commanded his feet to go on . And they went  --  toward her . He rested his folded arms heavily on the tall desk . " I 'll miss you , " he said . " I 'll miss you very much . It wo n't seem the same here without you . " " But maybe you 'll be leaving , too . If your plans are taken , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't seem to care so much about them as I ought  --  now they 're out of my hands . And I ca n't count on them . I suppose we 'll not see each other very often after you leave here . I 'll be leaving your aunt 's in a few days . My  --  my people are coming home . " " Oh ! You 'll be glad of that . " " Yes . " And again , " Yes . " He let his eyes dwell hungrily on her , as though this were indeed their farewell , drinking in every detail of her  --  the dark curling wisps straying from under her hat , the slate-gray eyes , a little sad just then , the slender girlish figure that seemed so frail . For that moment there were no Shirley , no law , no honor . " I 'll miss you , " he said again and fumbled at his collar . " One way and another I owe you a great deal . I sha n't forget that . I sha n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  to prison , I thought  --  and found some good friends . One very good friend who  --  " " Do n't ! " The little hand lying on the desk clenched tightly . " Do n't talk about it . I  --  " She got slowly down from the stool . " I must be going now . " But her eyes did not leave his . They went suddenly dark . And in them he read the same hurt that was in his own heart . He saw with a fierce blinding joy  --  then with horror  --  and then with joy again . " Esther ! You , too ! Oh , I never wanted that . I hoped you  --  Oh , Esther ! " She gave him no answer but stood looking at him piteously . No one , seeing them , could have failed to understand . The man who had come to the door saw and understood . It was Jonathan . They saw him . No word passed then ; there was nothing to say . She moved slowly out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if in a daze , following her with their eyes . When her footsteps had died away , they looked at each other helplessly . " David ! " Jonathan 's voice broke like a boy 's . " David ! What have you done ? " After a little that cry reached David 's understanding . " I never knew  --  " He turned away from the stricken accusing face . He heard Jonathan start away at last , then turn and come toward him . A letter was laid on the desk . " I was bringing this to you , " said Jonathan 's choking voice . And again , " David ! David ! " That time Jonathan did not return . Mechanically David took up and opened the letter . He had to read it twice before he grasped its import . " The committee of St. Mark 's has selected your plans . . . . We shall want you to supervise the work . . . usual terms . . . congratulations . " The letter fluttered from his hands to the floor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to have even the consolation of knowing that no one but himself had been hurt . It would be on his soul that he had hurt her , too  --  cruelly , hopelessly hurt her . And he could not help her , only run away and leave her to face it alone . And Jonathan , his kind friend  --  the meaning of the grief on that homely face was plain . The cup of David 's misery ran over . He fell forward on the desk , her desk , pillowing his head on his arms . " Esther ! " As if summoned by the cry , another little imp took stand by David 's ear . And his tongue was specious and honeyed , and he had the trick of making black seem white and gray a golden splendor . Why run away and leave her to face it alone ? . . . He was there a long time . It grew dark . The street , deserted by its daylight toilers , grew quiet except for the tramping of an occasional heavy-footed watchman or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draining his bitter cup  --  and listening to the eloquent imp . Once to nearly every man comes an hour when he stands on a high mount and is shown the kingdom of his desire , to be his if he will  --  at a price . There David stood that evening . And he fell . He listened and looked too long . He did not haggle with his tempter over the price but agreed to pay , if only he might have his beautiful kingdom . He did not hear stealthy footsteps along the corridor , nor the rustling of cautiously drawn shades in Jonathan 's office . The visitor , too , supposed that he had the building to himself . But he worked by the light of a dark-lantern and tiptoed instinctively . Very carefully , as his former cell-mate had taught him , he made his preparations , substituting a sixty- for a six-ampere fuse  --  which would give him , the old cracksman had said , " juice " enough to cut through the ribs of a war-ship  --  and clamping one strand of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he unscrewed all the light bulbs from their sockets lest , when he turned the switch , a sudden glow through the shades arouse some prowling watchman 's curiosity . Then he took up the other strand of his wire , to which was attached a carbon electrode , knelt on the floor and  --  gingerly , for so much juice suggested many possibilities to a novice  --  touched the carbon to the safe door . He drew back hastily , almost unnerved . The old cracksman had not warned him of that blinding flash or that sputtering , loud enough , so it seemed , to be heard a block away . But he remembered that Jonathan often kept money overnight in the safe . He forced himself to make the contact again . David heard a shuffling sound from a near-by office . He straightened stiffly , wondering dully who the newcomer was . The watchman probably , on a round of inspection . Or perhaps Jonathan , who came to his office sometimes of nights to work off odds and ends that his lack of system allowed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had been hurt , whose stricken , accusing , contemptuous face danced before him . David 's heart gave a sharp twinge at that . He hoped it was not Jonathan . He did not want to face Jonathan just then . He started at a sudden crackling report that resounded through the lonely building , followed by a strange continued sputtering . He went slowly into the corridor and to Jonathan 's office . At the door he stopped , staring in stupid surprise at the intent kneeling figure dimly outlined in the glow of hot metal and the bluish crackling flame . Then , with a vague notion that it was the wrong thing to do but his overwrought brain not quite grasping the situation , he took two steps into the room . " Get out of here  --  whoever you are . " With a muttered ejaculation the intruder turned his head to look , then sprang back from the safe , breaking the contact . Instantly the room became black . David stared , still stupidly , at the dull red spot on the safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He stood very still , muscles tense , senses sharply alert . He heard a faint rustling but he could not make out from what part of the room it came . Smith crouched , rigid and breathless , waiting for a shot . It did not come . Slowly , as silently as possible , he reached for the sheath knife he carried and drew it . He had a gun , but a knife , the old cracksman had said , was much better for a fight in the dark and it had the superlative virtue of noiselessness . He became motionless again , his eyes vainly straining to pierce the darkness , waiting for the other to make a move . The silence and inaction became unbearable . He gathered his nerve and muscles for a rush to where the door ought to be and leaped forward . At the third step a fist struck out and caught him on the neck . He recoiled a little , then lashed out blindly with the knife . He heard a sharp gasp and a body crumpling to the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the door , he sped along the corridor and through the shop to the rear window where he had entered . A quarter of an hour later a watchman espied the open window . He whistled a policeman to his aid and together , after a period of timorous deliberation , they entered and with many discreet pauses tiptoed over the building . They found David in the corridor , where he had given up crawling , weakly trying to stanch the flowing blood . The policeman was young and new to his job . He mopped his brow nervously at sight of so much blood . " Are yez much hurted , d'yez think ? " he inquired anxiously . " More scared than hurt , probably . " David smiled wanly . " But , just the same , I think you 'd better call up a doctor . " CHAPTER XII WHICH HOUSE ? The doctor did not share David 's opinion . He shook his head gravely , looked important and said , " It 's lucky I got here so soon . " Then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clean cut and we 'll do what we can . " So , he stopped the flow of blood , washed out the wound with an antiseptic solution and took several stitches ; which hurt much worse than Smith 's knife had . Then he ordered David to the hospital . But by that time some one had got Jonathan by telephone and he said , " No , bring him here . " And David protesting in vain , an ambulance took him to Jonathan 's house and gentle hands laid him on the bed of the special guest-room . A nurse was installed and in time David fell asleep . Through the night Jonathan watched , stealing every few minutes to David 's bedside . It was not at all necessary ; the nurse slept , no fears disturbing her slumbers . But Jonathan wanted to watch . He kept thinking that David might have died . He shuddered and went pale at the thought . For Jonathan had loved David ; he loved him even now . The bitterness of that day was gone ; so much could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one tragedy , so narrowly escaped , did not help Jonathan to forget another impending  --  if it was to be tragedy . His heart ached for his friends ; it was only of them he thought now . They faced each other across a chasm too wide to be leaped or bridged ; only by a descent into chill dark depths could their outstretched hands meet . He did not blame them for having strayed to that brink ; not in the impulses of the heart do we sin , only in the yielding . But such chasms need not be tragic . There grow the sweetest flowers for those having the will to see and gather . All his life Jonathan had been schooled in that lesson , and he had learned to pluck happiness as he turned his back on desire . He had even been happy in an unrequited love , he had not sought to cast it out of his heart , he had loved his love  --  at least until it had seemed helpless to save her from a hurt . He could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could find strength and courage and the greater triumph growing on the brink of their chasm . It seemed very simple and easy , what he wanted them to learn . He did not understand that only the Greathearts find it simple and easy . He never suspected that he was a Greatheart . An odd fish , this Jonathan ! But it was a knowledge that he could not give them . They must win it , if at all , for themselves . In the morning the doctor came again , inspected the wound , discovered no evidence of infection and was mightily pleased with himself . " Do n't look so sad , " he adjured David . " You got off lucky . If that knife  --  " " I suppose so , " David said querulously . " If you 've finished , would you mind going ? I 'd like to sleep some more . " The doctor nodded comprehendingly . " Pretty weak yet , " he confided to the nurse in a whisper . " Lost quite a bit of blood before I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David closed his eyes . Not , however , to sleep . Rather to listen to his tempter , who had returned to stand guard , to keep the victory it had won . But the imp 's words were less plausible this morning , a certain sly malice had crept into his voice . David remembered shrinkingly the resolve he had taken . " It 's because I am weak . " He tried to stiffen himself . " I have a right to be happy . Why should two be made to suffer for one who would n't care ? " He repeated that over and over to himself and almost achieved belief . The nurse came to his bedside . " I 'm going out for my walk now . Ring this bell if you want anything , and one of the maids will come . " He nodded and she left . A minute later he heard other steps coming into the room . " David  --  David ! " said a voice over him . A compassionate voice that was near to breaking . He opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'm making a good deal of trouble . You should have let them take me to the hospital . " " Hush , David ! I wanted you to come here . Is the wound very painful ? " " I 've had toothaches that were worse . " " It 's like you to make light of it . " " It is n't like me to make light of it . You 've seen me and ought to know that . It 's more like me to whine . " " But it 's serious . " Jonathan shook his head gravely . " The doctor says , if the knife had gone an eighth of an inch deeper  --  " " They always say that , do n't they ? It did n't go an eighth of an inch deeper . " " But it might have , " Jonathan insisted . " David , why did you do it ? Did you think a little money was worth such a risk ? " David frowned petulantly . " I 'm no hero . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blundered in and was too stupid to get out . So I got hurt . It 's a habit of mine . " " Ah ! " Jonathan understood the allusion . " David , can you forgive me ? Yesterday I was thinking you  --  what you are not . I was bitter , not quite myself . I was blaming you for what you could n't help and thinking you were going  --  " " Do n't ! Do n't talk about that ! I  --  " David turned his face to the wall . " I wish to God Smith 's knife had gone deeper ! " Jonathan started . " Smith ! You say it was Smith ? Then this happened because of me . I let myself get at odds with all the world and in that temper sent him from the shop . You have much to forgive me for , David . " " That 's pretty far-fetched , is n't it ? If it 's any consolation , I could n't swear it was Smith . I only had a glimpse of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if any one questions you about what happened , you need n't identify Smith . I hate to think of any man having to go to jail . Sin is its own punishment  --  and heavy enough . God knows ! We must find Smith , David , and try to help him . You could help him most . When he knows that you , whom he hurt , are ready  --  " " Do whatever you want with him . I have no wish to send him to jail . " David stirred restlessly ; his wound began to throb . Why could n't the manikin go away and take his silly exaggerated  --  and disturbing  --  sentimentalities with him ? Did n't he know that his very presence there was a reminder of something David wanted to forget  --  that the kingdom of desire was not to be entered without payment ? But Jonathan did not leave , though he saw what the patient wished . He went without further detours to the thing that lay between them . " David , what are you going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the wall . " What are you going to do , David ? " David had not guessed how hard it would be to give tongue to his desire . " I do n't know that you have any right to ask . But if it will do you any good to know , I 'm going to get free and  --  " He turned and looked defiantly into Jonathan 's eyes . He saw the suffering there . But Jonathan 's voice was still gentle . " You would do that ? " " I would do that . " " You mean , " Jonathan persisted , " you will get a divorce ? And then go to her ? " How ugly , how sordid , that seemed , spoken aloud in the clear light of morning ! But David said , " I mean that . " " Have you thought of  --  your wife ? " " She would n't be hurt , would n't really care . " " And you have a boy . A beautiful boy , I am told . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Ah ! the price ! You have thought of the price then . And you are ready to pay it . Other people have paid it , I know . I have wondered if they did n't pay too much . David  --  " Jonathan looked away . " Have you thought of  --  her ? " " Ca n't you understand I am thinking of her ? I ca n't let her be hurt . And I want her  --  you ca n't know  --  " He flung an arm over his face . And he was glad of the sharp pain that shot through his side . " I know , " said Jonathan . " I know . " They were silent for a while . The silence became almost unbearable to one of them . He let his arm fall slowly to his side . " Well , say it ! If you have anything against it , say it . " " No . " Jonathan turned to him once more , sadly . " I have nothing to say against it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had . I say only , do it , if you think she will not be hurt  --  if you think you can . . . . I must go now . " He left . Soon the nurse returned . She looked closely at her patient and took a thermometer from the table . " No ! " he said sharply . " I 'm all right . Just go away and leave me alone . " Being a wise nurse , she obeyed . . . . When Jonathan reached his office a trembling white-faced girl was awaiting him . " How is he ? " He told her . " It need n't be serious . But he had a narrow escape . " " Why did n't you let me know last night ? " " It would have done no good . " He looked at her searchingly . But neither shrinking nor shame was in her eyes . " Will you go to him now ? " " Go to him ? I  --  Why do you ask that ? " " He needs you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else who can help him now . Will you go ? " " Yes . " She understood the help that was needed . " Then come . " Together they went out to the street . He hailed a taxicab and they entered and drove away . Neither spoke during that ride . When they reached the house he led her to the parlor . " If you will wait here , " he said , " I will get the nurse away . " In a few minutes he returned . " You may go up now . " He watched her ascend , heard her quick light tread along the hall above and the closing of a door . " Esther ! " he whispered . " My poor Esther ! Who will help you ? " CHAPTER XIII THE HAPPY ENDING She halted just within the closed door . At first he could not believe it was she . For a little he went blind , a black streaming mist hiding her from him . But when it cleared away she was still there . Their eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You came ! I did n't believe  --  " " He asked me to come . " " He asked you ! I do n't understand  --  " " Would you rather I had stayed away ? " For answer he held out hungry arms toward her . He would have sat upright ; pain and weakness were forgotten . But she was at his side in a breath . " You must not . " She put her hands on his shoulders to restrain him . He caught them and held them close to him . She let him for a moment , then gently freed them from his clasp . " It is no worse than he says  --  your hurt ? " " It is n't bad at all . " " You 're sure ? You see , I did n't know until I got to the office . And they made it out very bad there . They even said you might n't live . And I had to wait until he came with definite word . It was terrible . When I thought  --  oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep up before others gave way . Suddenly she sat on the bed , pressing both hands tightly against her face . " Do n't , Esther ! " Her weakness hurt him . " Do n't ! There 's nothing to cry for . " " Let me . I 'll be all right  --  in a minute . " He let her then . And he wished that the hot iron in his own heart could be cooled a little in tears . But his eyes were dry and aching and the iron burned deeper . There was something to cry for . " Now ! " It was the tempter whispering . " Now is the time to tell her . " But a strange paralysis was on his tongue and will . She waited until she could achieve the smile she wanted him to see . Then she let her hands fall to her lap . And in the brightness of that smile the tears on her lashes were dewdrops that had caught the morning sunlight . " Speak up ! Now ! " It was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now was the time to tell her of that beautiful kingdom and how he proposed to win it for them , to ask her to wait until he could lead her through its gates . And still he could not . . . . And suddenly he knew that he never could . . . . " There ! " The smile was perfect . " That is over . I did n't mean to be so foolish . It 's only because I had been thinking it was so much worse . Now I can take time to be glad . About this , I mean . " From the pocket of her jacket she drew forth a folded sheet of paper and held it out to him . It was the letter from St. Mark 's . " It seems almost too good to be true , does n't it ?  --  though we ought never to say that . I found it on the floor by my desk this morning . I thought it was some of the office correspondence and opened it and  --  do you mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it through . I hardly knew what I was doing . It did n't seem important then . But now  --  Oh , I am glad  --  glad ! " She nodded brightly . " The finest thing in the world has happened . " He looked dully at the letter which ought to have meant so much to him . " I had forgotten that . " " It means you can go back to your own profession , does n't it ? " " I suppose so . Yes , it means that . " " It has been like a story , has n't it ? This summer , I mean . A beautiful story ! In the beginning you came to the office  --  to prison , you said . And I was plodding along , trying to make myself believe that I liked bookkeeping . A pair of lame ducks we were , with broken wings . I 'm a little sorry for us yet  --  are n't you ? But now we  --  Do you think it would hurt you if I raised the shades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunshine . " " It would n't hurt , of course . " She went to the windows and raised the shades and the morning radiance , the light in which all hues are seen as they are , flooded the room . Then she went back to her seat beside him . " That is much better , is n't it ? . . . A beautiful story ! Now our wings are strong again . . . . " And so she went on , painting in the brightest colors she knew how to mix what she supposed the future held for them . She tried to make it splendid . St. Mark 's was to be but a beginning . He was to go very far , building many beautiful churches , striving to make each a little finer than the one before , until he was famous throughout the land  --  " Which is worth something , of course , but not half so much as knowing that you have done good work . You remember , I said once that would be your great reward . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overdo her voice practise at first . After a while , when she had grown stronger , she would study hard to make up for the years she had lost , perhaps go abroad to work under the great voice builders and coaches there . And " some day , " perhaps , rumor would tell him of a new contralto whom people loved to hear sing . . . . It was a little childish , no doubt , and rather overdone . But he did not think of that . He was not listening . He was seeing , not the picture she painted but that which she made , there in the sunshine . She was whiter than ever . Deep shadows were under her eyes . But the eyes themselves were very steady , her voice never quavered , nor did the smile flicker . Where did she get her spirit , this slender fragile girl who seemed so in need of another 's strength for support ? And upon the bright brave soul of her he had wanted to put a stain . He could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For the questions Jonathan had left burning in David 's heart had answered themselves . As he watched her , he saw what on the high mount he had refused to see . He had hurt her enough . Not through another hurt could he find healing for her . And it would hurt her , what he had planned . It would take from her all that he loved ; and it would add shame , the shame of cowardice , if not of cruelty to others . He could not do that ; even if she were willing he could not . Yielding was not the simple thing it had seemed . Something he lacked  --  or something he had  --  which forever shut the gates of that kingdom upon him . It had been but an evil impossible dream . But a beautiful dream ! There was yet no joy in renunciation . David went down from the mount into the valley where shadows were deep and unbroken . " And so the story ends happily , as it should . Everything has come out right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " " You must n't say that . You must n't think  --  " " Esther ! " It was hard to meet her eyes then . " I 've got to say it  --  to let you see the sort of man I am . Last night I was thinking of  --  of what has happened to us and what we would do . There seemed only one way out that I could bear . I made up my mind . I was going to you to tell you that I would get free  --  I would have managed that somehow  --  and then come to you . I could have done it  --  last night . " The smile faded . She waited for him to continue . " But Smith stopped me . I am glad he stopped me . For now  --  " He could not go on . " Now you ca n't . Is that it ? " " I ca n't . " " I am glad you ca n't . " She said it very quietly . Her eyes left his and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shone on the thin tired face came not from without . The ugly tempter lifted its wings and flew swiftly away . " Are you , " he began again at last , " revising your opinion of me ? I hope you are . " A hand fell lightly on his lips . " I do n't want to revise my opinion of you . I could n't . And I understand  --  what you wanted and why it is impossible for us . Because  --  last night  --  I could have let you do it . " " Oh , Esther , I never meant to hurt you . Can you believe that ? " " I know . But you have n't hurt me  --  even though for a while I was shameless as I never thought I could be . I said the story has ended happily . And it has  --  with the happiest ending possible , the only happy ending it could have . Because there is nothing to regret . " " Nothing to regret ! " Unbelief was in his gaze . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't you see  --  ca n't you understand ? " She leaned over him , giving him her eyes , letting him look to the very depths he had once wanted to explore . He saw love there , and joy in love , but as well the will to renounce gladly  --  and no lurking shadow to say that she had bravely lied . " Do you believe  --  that I am not unhappy and will not be ? " " I ca n't understand . But I have to believe . I am glad to believe . " He closed his eyes and relaxed his tired body , to learn that the wound was throbbing sharply . But that was a little thing . She sat beside him , her face turned again to the sunlight . Once she reached out and touched his hand caressingly ; he caught hers and clung to it as though he could not let it go . It was not a long silence . But it was long enough . In those few minutes he went up out of the valley again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , too , came the free will to renounce ; and understanding . Sorrow abode with him still , an exquisite pang that was to leave a lasting scar . But in his heart glowed a strange fire  --  as if for some splendid victory  --  lighted only for that hour , it may be , but revealing to him what he had found ; a love that had not failed , that asked nothing , able to triumph over all things , even itself . It was so he had dreamed love might be . He was glad he had found it . He was glad of the cup it had put to his lips . He was the richer for her . He would be the richer for seeing her go . He hoped that the sorrow would never quite pass out of his heart , that the love would never shrink to a mere memory . He lifted shining eyes to hers . " Now I understand ! Some things are n't worth all they cost . What I wanted last night is one of them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even though  --  " " Nor would I. " Tears were gemming her eyes once more . But they were not sorrowful tears and they did not fall . It was time for her to go . The hands that had not ceased to cling fell apart . She went slowly across the room . At the door she lingered a moment , looking back . Through the streaming mist he saw her face , bright in the white glory of renunciation . She smiled . . . and was gone . . . . The same brightness was upon him . But he did not know that . He stood on the mount to which she had led him , still seeing her . And still there were no regrets . To him was coming the strength he was to need , a faith in himself that was to tide him over many gray morrows . It was a very high place , the peak of his life . Ever afterward he was to look up to that hour . * * * * * * That evening came Shirley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her back at David 's door . He had fever and the dreaded infection had set in . There must be no excitement . So Shirley must wait . Two days more she had to wait , anxious days during which she learned fast . On the third the nurse raised the embargo for a few minutes , and Shirley , breathless and afraid , went to the door through which the other had gone . He was ready for her coming . His only dread was that she might see what he must never let her know . He had a deep pitying tenderness for her , to whom love had appeared only as a pretty toy . She halted uncertainly at the door . He saw that she doubted her welcome . " David , do you still want me to come ? " " Come , Shirley . " She went quickly to him and knelt by his side , and kissed him . " Dear , I wanted to come . I could n't stay away . And it was n't because you gave me a choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I believe that , Shirley . " " You only said , ' Come . ' Do n't you really want me ? Do you think that after a while , when I 've learned all I have to learn  --  and proved what I have to prove  --  you will be glad that I came ? " " I am glad now . " He touched the pretty gleaming hair caressingly . " I believe you are ! And they said  --  oh , David ! " She caught his hand and pressed it to her cheek . Then he saw that she had come to the threshold of her house of toys and stood looking out , trembling and frightened before the bigness of the real world . He was staggered by that . She had come to the door too late ; for if she fared forth , she must go alone and untaught through a country whose loneliness he had known . He must save her from that . He could not give her the one thing which could companion her through those arid wastes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gently he sought to lead her back into her playhouse . " Shirley , I have a confession to make . While you were gone St. Mark 's decided to build . I submitted some plans and  --  they were accepted . Do you like my surprise ? " " Then you can go back to your profession . I am glad of that . " " It 's a big commission , Shirley . Almost as big as St. Christopher 's would have been . We 'll be rolling in wealth  --  for us . " " You wo n't have to worry any more . I am glad of that , too . " She was resisting , looking back toward the still open door and the prospect beyond . It had frightened her , but it had thrilled her , too . Anxiously he pointed inward . " It means more than that . If I 've done pretty well  --  and I 'm sure I have  --  it will bring a lot more work . We can have all the things our mouths used to water for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once , and have a maid , maybe a nurse for Davy Junior . We 'll take on the club again  --  think of hearing the crack of a good drive once more ! There 'll be theaters and concerts , with a taxi on rainy evenings . And when we 're settled in that new apartment we 're going to give a beautiful dinner to celebrate our return to the surface . My stars ! ca n't you see our guests ' eyes popping ? And when the first check comes in from the St. Mark 's people I 'm going to buy you  --  let 's see , what shall I buy you ?  --  Pinch me , please . When I think of it I ca n't quite realize that it 's true . Is n't it bully , Shirley  --  dear ? " " Of course , " she said slowly . " But somehow those things  --  they seem so  --  so little , now I have you back . Do they really mean so much to you , David ? " " You 've come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And there 'll be no worries to make things hard for us , no penny-pinching and discontent , no  --  misunderstandings . Do n't you see ? It 's the whole thing . And so  --  " He tried to laugh gaily , but an echo was in his heart . " And so the story ends happily . " For a little a question rested in her eyes . His laugh , trailing off into huskiness , puzzled her , vaguely hurt her . She sighed . Then habit began to prevail . The poor little sentimental regret for this sudden prosperity died . Her eyes rested on the pretty new toys tricking out her house . And as she looked the door closed softly , shutting her in forever . She did not know . " Do you know , I was almost sorry for a minute ? I hardly know why . It is better this way . We 'll have to go back to believing in fairies , sha n't we ? " Her eyes were dancing . Happiness tinted her velvety cheeks . All that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I believe we 're going to be happier than ever before ! " THE END
