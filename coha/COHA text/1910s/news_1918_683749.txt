txt Shell Contracts Placed , but Some Companies Are So Filled Up They Decline to Undertake More at Present  --  Government May Aid Some Firms Negotiations are in progress for the placing of orders amounting to something like $200,000,000 for field pieces and big guns for the army . orders for shells are still being placed , but there seems to be difficulty over getting sufficient finishing space . In the case of some of the most recently placed contracts only the forgings have been let so far , and the manufacturers of these do not know to - what machining concern they will be delivered . Companies - which already have orders for shells of various sizes have been approached with offers of more business , but some of them at any rate are so loaded up that they decline to consider any additional contracts . It is probable that the Government will have to assist , concerns that have never made the articles required to enter these new fields . This was done several months ago when the first lot of gun contracts was placed .
