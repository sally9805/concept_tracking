SCENE  --  The study in the house of David Roylston at Tarryville-on-Hudson , New York . In the middle of the far side of the room , a fireplace . To the right of it , a door . The remaining space of the back wall is covered by book-cases which frame the fireplace and door . In the left foreground , another door . Next to it , a writing desk . Still farther back , a book-case . On the right , a leather sofa and armchairs . On either side of the sofa , an open window looking out on the garden . In the center of the room , a table on which are a heap of books and an electric reading lamp with a green shade . A few framed prints of Old Masters are hung on the walls . It is about ten o'clock on a sultry night in early May . David Roylston is seated at the table , writing . He is a tall , slender , dark-haired man of thirty-five with large handsome features , a strong , ironical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . He has taken off his coat which hangs from the back of his chair . He wears a white shirt with soft collar and black bow tie , grey trousers , and low tan shoes with rubber soles . Benton enters from the door at the rear and stands waiting for Roylston to notice his presence . He is fifty-five , clean-shaven , discreetly soft-spoken . One of his eyes is badly crossed giving him a look of sly villainy quite out of keeping with his placid temperament . He wears a livery . ROYLSTON  --  ( looking up from his writing ) Well , Benton ? p. 3 BENTON  --  Shall I shut the windows , sir ? It 's started to rain a little . ROYLSTON  --  No , I will close them myself when I go to bed . BENTON  --  ( reproachfully ) They were open when I came down this morning , sir . ROYLSTON  --  Were they ? I must have forgotten all about them last night . Never mind ; there 's nothing much worth the stealing in this house except ideas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But if it will ease your anxiety , you may close them . There 's a draft in here . BENTON  --  Yes , sir . ( He closes the windows . ) ROYLSTON  --  Any telephone calls while I was out ? BENTON  --  Mrs. Roylston called up , sir ; wished me to tell you that she and the children had arrived safely in New York ; had a very pleasant trip in the motor ; roads were fine all the way down . She said the children were very excited to think they were really going to the theatre . ROYLSTON  --  ( abstractedly ) Ah , indeed . No one else called up ? BENTON  --  No , sir . ROYLSTON  --  Not even the young lady who has ( ironically ) asked my advice so frequently of late ? p. 4 BENTON  --  No , sir . ROYLSTON  --  Well , whenever the young lady in question calls up again you are to tell her I am writing and can not be disturbed . BENTON  --  Yes , sir . ROYLSTON  --  ( impatiently ) She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ midst of a play and have no time for such foolishness . BENTON  --  Very good , sir . Anything else before I go to bed , sir ? ROYLSTON  --  No , you may go . ( Benton takes Roylston 's light overcoat , hat , and stick , which are lying on one of the armchairs , and starts to go out . ) Leave those here . I may take a walk later on to get a breath of the Spring and blow the cobwebs out of my brain , and I do n't care to be barking my shins in the dark hall . ( Benton lays them down again . A doorbell is heard ringing somewhere in the house . ) Who can that be at this time of the night ? ( as Benton hurries out through the door on the left ) Remember , Benton , I 'm busy  --  too busy to be disturbed . BENTON  --  Yes , sir . ( He goes out . Roylston bites his pen nervously , trying to concentrate his thoughts . A minute or so later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over a card in his fingers. ) p. 5 ROYLSTON  --  Well ? BENTON  --  It 's a lady , sir . ROYLSTON  --  Has she gone ? BENTON  --  No , sir , she  --  ROYLSTON  --  ( frowning ) Did you tell her I was busy ? BENTON  --  Yes , sir , but she said she must see you on a very important matter ; said she would n't leave till she saw you . This is her card , sir . ROYLSTON  --  ( looking at it ) Mrs. George Frazer  --  hm  --  Mrs. , eh ? ; never heard of her . An old crank of some kind , I suppose ? BENTON  --  Quite the other way , sir ; young and pretty , I should say , if I 'm any judge . ROYLSTON  --  Anyone come with her ? BENTON  --  I do n't think so , sir ROYLSTON  --  Alone , at this time of night , and ( sarcastically ) a lady , you say ? BENTON  --  ( promptly ) No doubt of that , sir ; but dressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; you know what I mean , sir . ROYLSTON  --  ( cynically ) Ah , then , I had better get my checkbook ready . p. 6 BENTON  --  Beg your pardon , sir , but she does n't seem that kind either ; not like one that 'd beg , I mean . I could n't make her out exactly . ROYLSTON  --  Perhaps she 's another aspiring playwright who wants me to write her last act for her . At any rate you have aroused my curiosity ; so show her in here . ( He takes his coat off the back of the chair and puts it on . ) BENTON  --  Very well , sir . ( He goes out through the door on the left . A moment later he shows in Mrs. Frazer . She is a tall , strikingly beautiful woman about twenty-eight years old . Her complexion is pale ; her eyes large , expressive , dark ; her hair black and wavy ; her figure inclining a little toward voluptuousness . There are shadows in under her eyes and her face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncertain . She has on a plain black dress such as is worn by the poorer class of working women . ) ROYLSTON  --  ( getting up and staring at her with open admiration ) Ah ! ( turning to Benton ) You may go , Benton . I sha n't need you again . I will take Mrs.  --  er ( looking at the card ) Mrs. Frazer to the door myself . BENTON  --  Yes , sir . ( He goes out. ) p. 7 MRS . FRAZER  --  ( uncertainly ) I hope you will pardon  --  ROYLSTON  --  ( indicating the armchairs on the left ) Wo n't you sit down , Mrs. Frazer ? ( She sits down in the one nearest to him . ) And now , what can I do for you ? MRS . FRAZER  --  I know this intrusion of mine is unpardonable . You must be terribly busy , and I have forced myself on you , interrupted your work  --  ROYLSTON  --  You must not feel conscience-stricken about that . I was only puzzling over a problem in construction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it for a time . MRS . FRAZER  --  But my coming here at this time of the night and alone ? ( forcing a smile ) What can you think of such a breach of all the conventions ! ROYLSTON  --  ( dryly ) You are the very first to accuse me of conventionality . I see nothing strange in your coming here when you wanted to , when you were able to . I have lived long enough in this suburb to know the difficulties of getting here at the time one wishes . MRS . FRAZER  --  ( looking at him for a moment with a questioning smile ) Ca n't you remember ever having seen me before ? p. 8 ROYLSTON  --  No , I must confess  --  MRS . FRAZER  --  And yet you have met me . I can , at least , plead that much justification for this encroachment on your time . ROYLSTON  --  ( trying to remember ) It 's no use . My brain is too full of marionettes to recall flesh-and-blood realities . I confess to my shame I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FRAZER  --  Oh , I did not dream of your remembering . We only spoke about two words to each other , and it was at least a year ago . You remember the ball Mr. Coleman , the artist , gave at his studio ? ROYLSTON  --  So it was there ? It would be too trite for me to say I knew I had seen you before ; but I really did have that feeling when you came in . One does n't forget a face like yours . So it was at Coleman 's studio ? He and I have been friends for years . MRS . FRAZER  --  He is a very dear friend of my  --  of mine , also . ROYLSTON  --  Do take off your hat now that we know who 's who . To see you sitting there with your hat on gives me the uncomfortable impression that this is a lawyer 's office and you are consulting your attorney  --  and I warn you I am far from being a legal adviser . p. 9 MRS . FRAZER  --  ( takes off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back in her chair ) I knew it . That is why I came . ROYLSTON  --  For advice ? MRS . FRAZER  --  Advice which I must have or  --  ROYLSTON  --  Or ? MRS . FRAZER  --  The crowning disillusion . ROYLSTON  --  ( smiling ) I hope it is not about me , the illusion . MRS . FRAZER  --  ( emphatically ) It is about you but it is not an illusion . ROYLSTON  --  Certainty goeth before disappointment . MRS . FRAZER  --  In this case it must not . I have borne so much already ,  --  I could not bear it . I must have something firm to stand on . ROYLSTON  --  Then it is not a play you come to consult me about ? ( seeing her mystified expression ) I beg your pardon , but you know there are so many playwrights-in-embryo who come to me for suggestions about their work  --  as if I could help them ; as if it were not absolutely necessary for them to work out their own salvation !  --  and I thought when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiling ) I see . No , I almost wish it were . I would like to be able to write a play even if it were only a very bad one . It would at least prove I was capable of creating something ; I 'm afraid even that is beyond my power . ROYLSTON  --  ( perfunctorily ) One never knows till one tries . The thing to do is to make a start ; and then , if necessary , realize one 's mistake smilingly . MRS . FRAZER  --  I intend to try sometime . ( apologetically ) I 'm wasting your time and I will come to the point at once ; or rather I will have to go back quite a ways to give you a clear idea of my present situation . ( nervously ) Wo n't you smoke or appear occupied with something ? I wo n't feel such an intruder if you do . ROYLSTON  --  ( laughing ) I would have done so before if I had known you did n't object . MRS . FRAZER  --  On the contrary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been accustomed to men who smoked . My father was a great smoker . ROYLSTON  --  ( who has taken a box of cigarettes from his pocket and lighted one ) There . ( He leans back in his chair in an attitude of attention. ) p. 11 MRS . FRAZER  --  To begin at the beginning ; My father was a prominent lawyer with a wide practice . He died five years ago leaving a large estate to my mother who is still alive but in very feeble health . They had only two children , my brother , five years older than I am , and myself . I tell you all this because you lay such stress in all your books and plays on the influence of environment , and I want you to understand thoroughly what mine was . Being the baby and pet of the family you can readily guess how I was brought up  --  governesses , private tutors , and finally a finishing school . Of course at the end of their elaborate system of education I knew only what a young lady of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ROYLSTON  --  ( smiling ) Naturally ; but you have progressed wonderfully since then . MRS . FRAZER  --  If I have , I have paid for it ; and whatever progress I have made I owe to you . ROYLSTON  --  ( wonderingly ) To me ? MRS . FRAZER  --  We have n't come to that part of the story yet . When I returned home from the finishing school my life became one long round of receptions , parties , balls , and so forth , until , in spite of the fact that at that time I was only interested in the most superficial things , I became surfeited , bored , and felt a longing to break away and experience something of more interest . p. 12 ROYLSTON  --  You wished to try your wings . MRS . FRAZER  --  Yes , that was it . It was about this time I met Mr. Frazer , the man who afterward became my husband . He was then , and still is , a broker on the New York Stock Exchange . He fascinated me . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the ( sarcastically ) financial giants , the daring gamblers who fought their battles to the bitter end of ruin . The house he was connected with is one of the largest on the Exchange and some of the so-called Napoleons of finance , whose names were forever in newspaper headlines , did their business through it . I thought of him doing his part in their gigantic enterprises , laboring to effect ever larger combinations in order that this glorious country might thrive and become ever greater and more productive . ( with a short laugh ) You can see what a child I was ; but I 'm afraid you 're not listening . ROYLSTON  --  ( eagerly ) I assure you you are mistaken . I am intensely interested . I was simply trying to recall something . Do you know when I watch you and listen to you talk I am forcibly reminded of some other woman . The likeness is so perfect it 's uncanny . MRS . FRAZER  --  May I ask who it is ? p. 13 ROYLSTON  --  That 's exactly what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone I know intimately and yet , for the life of me , I can not bring the exact person to my mind . MRS . FRAZER  --  How strange . ROYLSTON  --  But I 'm interrupting you . Please go on with your story . MRS . FRAZER  --  Well , the inevitable happened . I fell in love with George  --  Mr. Frazer  --  and he with me , and after a short engagement we were married . My family approved of him in every way . I believe they cherished the same illusion about his business , in a modified form , perhaps , as I did . ROYLSTON  --  Do you not think your husband also had the same illusions ? MRS . FRAZER  --  It would be hard to say . In justice to him I must acknowledge he always seemed to idealize it . He never could see his business in all its hideousness as I came to see it , and I do n't think he wore a mask just for my benefit ; but you never can tell . ROYLSTON  --  Most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much a part of themselves , you know . And after you were married ? MRS . FRAZER  --  Oh , the usual honeymoon trip to Europe with it 's inevitable visits to Westminster Abbey , the tomb of Napoleon , the Cologne Cathedral , and other points of interest . p. 14 ROYLSTON  --  ( ironically ) How ideal ! MRS . FRAZER  --  And yet I was very happy , or thought I was happy , which is much the same thing . Of course in the light of what I now know , of what you have taught me , I can see it was merely a stupid happiness , the content of the born blind who have never seen the light . ROYLSTON  --  And I am to blame for your enlightenment ? MRS . FRAZER  --  To blame ? ROYLSTON  --  Since it has made you unhappy it must be blameworthy . MRS . FRAZER  --  ( with fine scorn ) What is such sluggish content worth ? When you had opened my eyes to the truth I repudiated it . I felt I must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ROYLSTON  --  ( bewildered  --  running his fingers through his hair  --  with laughing impatience ) How you do remind me of someone ! And yet I can not remember  --  But tell me how this great change came about . After your return from your honeymoon I suppose your husband laid aside his role of lover and became the business man once more , leaving you to ornament his home , and brood , and read my novels and plays . MRS . FRAZER  --  That is what you would naturally think , is n't it ? However , you are quite wrong . My husband was as much the lover on the day I left him as he had been when we were married seven years before . p. 15 ROYLSTON  --  Then you have left him ? MRS . FRAZER  --  Yes , eight months ago . ROYLSTON  --  Have you no children ? MRS . FRAZER  --  No . I used to be very sorry we had not ; but now I am glad . It would have made it so much harder for me when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in love with someone else ? MRS . FRAZER  --  ( flushing ) If I had ceased to love my husband it is no reason why  --  ROYLSTON  --  ( smiling ) You must not be offended . It usually happens that way you know . MRS . FRAZER  --  ( earnestly ) I was in love with an ideal  --  the ideal of self-realization , of the duty of the individual to assert its supremacy and demand the freedom necessary for its development . You had taught me that ideal and it was that which came in conflict with my marriage . I saw I could never hope to grow in the stifling environment of married life  --  so I broke away . ROYLSTON  --  ( gravely ) Please tell me in what manner I effected this change in you . p. 16 MRS . FRAZER  --  I bought one of your novels one day about two years ago , more out of curiosity than anything else . It was the one about Wall Street . ROYLSTON  --  You mean " The Street " . MRS . FRAZER  --  Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that book of mine which disillusioned you about your husband 's business ? MRS . FRAZER  --  Yes . When I first read it I could n't believe it . I began to ask George questions about his deals and so forth . He was surprised and happy to find me interested in his work and he finally used to explain all his transactions to me  --  and then I knew . ROYLSTON  --  Hm . MRS . FRAZER  --  I tried to persuade him to go into something else . He acknowledged there was a lot of truth in your book but said there were two ways of looking at everything . When I pleaded with him he laughed and called me his " dear little muckraker " . ROYLSTON  --  ( smiling ) So you became disillusioned about the broker  --  but how about the man ? MRS . FRAZER  --  Your book made me long to read what you had to say about other things . I bought all your published works , and went to see all your plays , not once but many times . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I were living together was the merest sham ; that we were contented because he was too busy and I was too lazy to analyze our position , to stop and think . For a long time I was very unhappy . I knew what I must do but I did not have the courage to do it . p. 17 ROYLSTON  --  ( impatiently ) Why did n't you tell him frankly how you felt ? MRS . FRAZER  --  I could n't . You see he was so good and kind to me and it seemed such heartless cruelty to hurt him . All the time I felt myself being ground smaller and smaller day by day . I discovered that he and I had not a thought in common . Everything he was interested in was so shallow . He never concerned himself with what lay beneath the surface and I know my thoughts bored him although he was far too kind to ever show it . He observed the change in me and it worried him but the only remedies he could suggest were ( with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or some other change of air . When I refused to go away he was at a loss what to do . I think toward the end he suspected I was in love with someone else . ROYLSTON  --  ( with a cynical smile ) I 'll wager he did . MRS . FRAZER  --  I resolved not to think . I plunged into all sorts of activities to try and forget myself . I learned shorthand and typewriting  --  ROYLSTON  --  ( interrupting her enthusiastically ) Good ! That is your salvation . MRS . FRAZER  --  ( wearily ) My soul refused to be lulled to sleep and there came a day when I left a note for my husband and left the house . I had been to see your play " Sacrifice " the night before for the tenth time . It seemed to breathe a message to me over the footlights . You remember when Mrs. Harding in the play leaves her husband with the words : " I have awakened ! " ? p. 18 ROYLSTON  --  ( his eyes searching hers with keen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go to . MRS . FRAZER  --  ( bearing his scrutiny unflinchingly ) And I have an ideal which I love . When I heard her say those words that night they impressed me as never before . I felt that I , too , had awakened ; that the time had come to assert my  --  ROYLSTON  --  ( with a sudden exclamation  --  interrupting her ) The puzzle is solved . What a dolt I am ! It is Mrs. Harding in my play you resemble so much . MRS . FRAZER  --  ( surprised ) Oh , is it ? I saw the play so many times , you see . ROYLSTON  --  And you left your husband the next day ? MRS . FRAZER  --  Yes . I sold some things which I had a right to call my own and bought a plain black dress . I knew I would have to become a worker , a wage-earner , and I wished to take nothing with me to remind me of the old life . ROYLSTON  --  ( sympathetically ) I can imagine the ordeals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful it is doubly hard . MRS . FRAZER  --  ( blushing  --  hurriedly ) At first I missed all the little comforts and luxuries I had been used to . I never knew till I had to do without them how they had grown into my life . I got bravely over that . I found it very hard to get work and harder still to keep it . The men were all such beasts and the women I had to come in contact with were so unintelligent and ordinary . p. 19 ROYLSTON  --  ( dryly ) You 'll find most people are  --  rather ordinary . MRS . FRAZER  --  In my last position I really thought for a time my employer was a gentleman . I discovered he was only playing a part to throw me off my guard and he turned out the worst of all . And then the unspeakably long nights in the dingy hall bedroom of a boarding house with no one to speak to , no money , no place to go ; not able even to take a walk alone on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups in the doorways and on the corners . Oh , yes , it has been hard ! ( her voice trembling ) It has been almost more than I could endure . ROYLSTON  --  ( kindly ) Come ; it was your ordeal of fire and you have borne up wonderfully . Have you never received word from your husband ? MRS . FRAZER  --  That is the worst of all . He has haunted me , waited for me at the doors of boarding houses , at the entrance of office buildings where I worked , pleading with me to come back , offering to do anything I wished , trying to force money on me , even pushing it in under the door of my room . He can not understand what has come over me . I think he really believes I am the victim of a mad infatuation for a married man ; and yet he has had me followed continually , to protect me , as he says , not to spy on me , and he knows I have seen no one . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And he looks so unhappy , so miserable . I feel so guilty whenever I see him . p. 20 ROYLSTON  --  ( gently ) Are you sure you no longer love him ? MRS . FRAZER  --  ( hysterically ) Oh , love , love , what is love ? How can I know ? I am certain I could no longer live with him . How can you doubt it after all I have told you ? I know that I like him very much and do not want to see him suffer on my account . ROYLSTON  --  ( after a pause  --  frowning ) Have you stopped to think that you might have been followed here ? MRS . FRAZER  --  I am certain I was not . He has given up hope . I have n't seen him in over a month . Besides , I took special pains to throw anyone off the track . I went down to the office building where I used to work this morning and left by a side entrance . I used the freight elevator to come down in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where have you been all day ? MRS . FRAZER  --  Sitting on a bench in Central Park . ROYLSTON  --  But good heavens , Mrs. Frazer , why did n't you come during the day ? MRS . FRAZER  --  I was afraid you might be out . You see , I had read in the paper that you always worked at night and I felt pretty sure of finding you . I could not afford more than one trip . To be quite frank with you , it was with the last dollar I had in the world that I came out here . p. 21 ROYLSTON  --  But if I had not been at home ? MRS . FRAZER  --  ( firmly ) I should have waited until you came . No matter how , I should have waited . ROYLSTON  --  ( plainly embarrassed  --  getting up and walking nervously about the room ) You have been frank with me , Mrs. Frazer . Will you permit me to be the same ? MRS . FRAZER  --  I wish you to be so . ROYLSTON  --  You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ask you ? MRS . FRAZER  --  I am not afraid . I know you are trying to help me . ROYLSTON  --  I am glad of that . What I want to ask is : Will you let me help you in  --  er  --  a pecuniary way ? MRS . FRAZER  --  ( rather indignantly ) How could you think so ? ROYLSTON  --  I mean as a loan , you know . You really ought to  --  MRS . FRAZER  --  You know I could not . ROYLSTON  --  Then you have not freed yourself from all prejudices after all . You will certainly let me see to it that you get a position where you will be well paid and respected ? p. 22 MRS . FRAZER  --  Gladly , and be more than grateful for your assistance . ROYLSTON  --  ( with a sigh of relief ) Then , that is settled . ( Mrs. Frazer suddenly breaks down and commences to sob . Roylston goes to her and lays his hand on her shoulder . ) There , there , Mrs. Frazer . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be , you know , for a woman in your position . The future will be much easier , you 'll find . Please do n't break down that way . ( a pause ) I feel as if I were responsible for all this and yet  --  MRS . FRAZER  --  ( wiping her tears away and trying to control herself ) You do n't understand . You are only looking at the material side . I do n't care about that . What I came here to demand  --  yes , demand , for I have a right to do so  --  was certainty , the assurance that I am on the right path . These past few weeks with their sleepless nights have been terrible . ROYLSTON  --  How can I  --  MRS . FRAZER  --  Had I the right to do what I did ? To cause others so much suffering ? Am I realizing the best that is in me or the worst ? My will to keep on striving is being broken . I doubt the worth of my action . When I see him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right ? " and I find no answer to satisfy me . I can only argue and argue until my brain aches . How can I bear hardship for a cause in which my faith is wavering ? That is why I come to you . p. 23 ROYLSTON  --  ( in a troubled voice ) I can not tell you how deeply grieved I am to have been even the indirect means of causing you pain . MRS . FRAZER  --  ( excitedly ) I have the right to come to you , have n't I ? Mentally I am your creation . That you had no knowledge of my existence when you wrote does not lessen your responsibility in my eyes . I demand that you restore my peace of mind by justifying me to myself . ROYLSTON  --  ( deeply moved ) What I have written can not apply to every case . ( with conviction ) But it is my sincerest belief that you have found yourself , that as things stand between you , it would be folly for you to go back to your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a higher satisfaction than you have ever before known or believed possible . Therefore I urge you not to give up the battle , for in the end you will achieve a victory well worth the winning . MRS . FRAZER  --  ( extending both her hands to him  --  gratefully ) You have given me new hope , new strength . ROYLSTON  --  ( taking her hands and looking into her eyes ) Promise me you will call on me whenever you need help in the future . p. 24 MRS . FRAZER  --  ( withdrawing her hands  --  simply ) I promise to do so . ROYLSTON  --  ( smiling ) You must now , you know . You have charged me with the responsibility . You must let me pay off my debt . MRS . FRAZER  --  ( forcing a smile ) Whenever my supply of will-power runs low I 'll come a-borrowing , never fear . ROYLSTON  --  By the way , I meant to ask you if your mother and brother know anything of all this ? MRS . FRAZER  --  No . My mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have not dared to tell her about it ; and I know she would never learn of it through Mr. Frazer . My brother is the manager of a railroad in Brazil and very seldom returns to this country or writes to me . So , of course , he knows nothing . ROYLSTON  --  But your husband 's family ? MRS . FRAZER  --  I believe he has told them something about my being in California for my health . ROYLSTON  --  You have that in your favor . Family interference always complicates matters . As for the position I promised you , I will see what I can do when I go to the city in the morning . I have many influential friends and I have no doubt a real opportunity will be found for you someplace . In the meantime I have lots of work which should be typewritten and if you care to  --  p. 25 MRS . FRAZER  --  Oh , how good of you ! Your encouragement has made me feel so hopeful , so full of energy , I am ready for anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before me . ROYLSTON  --  It will be full of obstacles , too . MRS . FRAZER  --  ( spiritedly ) The harder the better . With your help I know I shall overcome them . ROYLSTON  --  You are overrating me . Take warning ! MRS . FRAZER  --  ( picking up her hat from the sofa ) And now I had better be going back to my little hall room . ROYLSTON  --  ( looking at his watch  --  then turning to her with a quizzical smile ) Yes , but how ? MRS . FRAZER  --  What do you mean ? ROYLSTON  --  I mean the little hall-room will have to remain empty tonight . You have missed the last train . MRS . FRAZER  --  ( apparently greatly astonished ) Surely you do n't mean it ? And I never looked at the timetable ! Why did n't you warn me ? ROYLSTON  --  I had no idea what time it was . p. 26 MRS . FRAZER  --  How stupid of me ! That comes of living in the city where you can always get the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ROYLSTON  --  It 's impossible , I 'm afraid . MRS . FRAZER  --  Then what can I do ? ROYLSTON  --  You must stay here . MRS . FRAZER  --  Here  --  in this house ? ROYLSTON  --  There is no alternative unless you wish to pass the night in the fields . MRS . FRAZER  --  There must be a hotel . ROYLSTON  --  There is only a roadhouse , a place of very questionable character , frequented by joy-riders and their  --  companions . You could not go there ; and I know of no other place . You see , there are nothing but summer residences around here and I am hardly acquainted with any of the neighbors. ( gravely ) Think of the time of night , and the rain , of the conclusions which would be drawn . You are beautiful and people have evil minds . Do n't you see the impossibility ? MRS . FRAZER  --  Yes  --  but , oh  --  how can I stay here ? What will your wife think ? ROYLSTON  --  She will not think . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I  --  I do n't understand . ROYLSTON  --  She is not here . Except for the servants I am all alone . MRS . FRAZER  --  ( genuinely alarmed ) Then I must go , even if I do have to spend the night in the fields . ROYLSTON  --  Listen ; there is rather a strange coincidence , or shall I say fatality in all this . My wife went with the children to see the fairy play in New York , and contrary to her usual custom  --  she does n't care for motoring  --  she went down in the machine . Otherwise I could have had the chauffeur drive you home ; but they wo n't return before tomorrow afternoon at the earliest . MRS . FRAZER  --  ( frightened ) This is terrible . How can I  --  ( hurries to the window and looks out ) It 's pouring . ROYLSTON  --  Fatality . MRS . FRAZER  --  ( imploringly ) Please , please suggest something ! You know I ca n't stay . ( She looks at him pleadingly  --  her lips tremble . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you believe you would be as safe here in my house as in your dingy hall bedroom ? p. 28 MRS . FRAZER  --  ( looking at him searchingly ) Yes  --  I know I would be  --  but  --  ROYLSTON  --  ( impatiently ) But you are afraid of appearances , of what people might think if they knew . You never learned that fear from me . Is not the knowledge of your own innocence enough to raise you above such considerations ? Or are you afraid I may be a Don Juan in disguise ? MRS . FRAZER  --  No , I am not afraid of you . ROYLSTON  --  And even if you fear appearances ? Who is to know ? MRS . FRAZER  --  ( wavering ) You forget your servant . ROYLSTON  --  He has been with me for years , was with my father before me , all his life has been in our service . I flatter myself he 's a model of discretion . MRS . FRAZER  --  But what will he think of me ? ( seeing Roylston 's scornful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay . ROYLSTON  --  Bravo ! It would be foolish and cowardly of you to get soaked with the rain and be insulted , and perhaps worse , in the railroad station for the sake of a worn-out code of ethics . MRS . FRAZER  --  ( smiling feebly ) Your wife might not think the ethics worn out . p. 29 ROYLSTON  --  ( carelessly ) Oh , my wife ; she would not think anything . If it would ease your conscience , I will tell her the whole thing . I 'm sure she 'd forget all about it ten minutes later ( contemptuously ) when the butcher came for his order . MRS . FRAZER  --  ( impulsively ) You do not love your wife , do you ? ( As Roylston looks at her in astonishment , she grows confused . ) What an impertinent question ! Forgive me ! ROYLSTON  --  ( lightly ) So impertinent I never dare ask it of myself . I have always rejected the temptation to analyze my home relations . They are pleasant enough and that is all I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sad smile ) If I had looked at it that way  --  ROYLSTON  --  The family relationship was the most important thing in the world for you at that time . With me it is purely secondary . My work comes first . As long as my home life gives free scope for my creative faculty I will demand nothing further of it . Life is too meager , too stingy with its favors , for us to ask for perfection . So I accept my domestic bliss at its surface value and save my analytical eye for the creations of my brain . ( smiling ) I see you are vainly trying to stifle a yawn , and I know you must be terribly tired and sleepy . Wo n't you let me direct you to your room ? ( He goes to the door on left. ) p. 30 MRS . FRAZER  --  ( forgetting her hat which she leaves lying on the sofa , smilingly walks over to him ) I am dismissed , then ? ROYLSTON  --  Far from it . I merely wish to save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( pointing ) You see the light at the top of the stairway ? Well , turn to your left when you reach the top and boldly enter the first room on your left . You will find everything there you need , I imagine . It is the official number one guest chamber . MRS . FRAZER  --  I suppose you wo n't retire for hours yet ? ROYLSTON  --  I have some work to finish up . MRS . FRAZER  --  ( catching herself in the act of yawning  --  with a laugh ) I ca n't deny I 'm sleepy  --  for the first time in months . ( giving him her hand ) If you only knew how grateful I am ! How can I ever thank you ? ROYLSTON  --  ( with sudden passion ) By looking at me like that . How beautiful you are ! MRS . FRAZER  --  ( withdrawing her hand  --  a note of warning in her voice ) Remember the Princess in the fairy tales who was as good as  --  p. 31 ROYLSTON  --  She was beautiful . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MRS . FRAZER  --  ( smiling ) Free to be good . ( She turns to go out the door . ) ROYLSTON  --  Good night . ( goes toward the table ) MRS . FRAZER  --  ( turns to him suddenly , a look of resolution on her face ) I must explain one thing before I go , before I accept your hospitality . I have told you a lie ; ( Roylston looks at her in surprise . ) I never met you at the studio ball . I was there but I did not meet you . I knew I had missed the last train . That is the reason I came so late . I wanted to miss it . And I knew there was no hotel for I made inquiries at the station . But I had no idea your wife would be away . ROYLSTON  --  ( staring at her in amazement ) But why , why ? MRS . FRAZER  --  I wanted to put you to the test , to see if you would help me and let me stay . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see if you were a real man with the courage of your convictions or just a theorist . ( hesitatingly ) You see in my agony of doubt it seemed necessary for me to get back of dry words to a flesh and blood reality . ( with a faint smile ) It all appears such a wild idea now ; and the test turned out to be a test of myself after all , did n't it ? p. 32 ROYLSTON  --  ( not able to recover from his astonishment ) You tell me this  --  now  --  that you purposely missed the last train ? MRS . FRAZER  --  ( flushing ) I am ashamed to say that is the exact truth . ( avoiding his ardent gaze ) I wish there to be no deception on my part after all your kindness to me . ROYLSTON  --  ( intensely ) Do you realize how beautiful you are ? Are you not afraid to make such a confession to me  --  of the conclusions I might be vain enough to draw from it ? ( He moves a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking straight into his eyes ) No  --  because I know now you are a real man . ROYLSTON  --  ( moving still nearer to her ) Take care ! The real men are usually the greatest sinners . MRS . FRAZER  --  But they protect the helpless . ( with a smile ) So you see how safe I am . Good night . ( She goes out . ) ROYLSTON  --  ( going to the door ) Good night . ( He watches her ascend the stairway . ) Good night . ( He comes back and sits down at the table again ; starts to look over his manuscript , glances upward in the direction of her room , throws his manuscript down with an exclamation of disgust , goes to the door on the left again and looks up at the top of the stairway , finally comes back to the table again and stands beside it for a moment , frowning thoughtfully and evidently weighing something in his mind . ) Damnation ! ( He takes his hat and light overcoat from the chair , puts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door at the back as SCENE  --  The same . It is about nine o'clock on the following morning . Bright sunlight streams in through the two open windows . Benton is arranging the papers and books on the table . Having finished he turns and is going out the door in the rear when he catches sight of Mrs. Frazer 's hat which is lying on the sofa . He gives a low whistle of amazement . A shadow falls across the sunlight at one of the windows and a moment later Weson , the gardener , puts his head into the room and peers around near-sightedly . He is an old withered man with a drooping gray mustache stained yellow by tobacco juice . BENTON  --  Good morning , Weson . WESON  --  Oh , it 's you , is it ? BENTON  --  Who did you think it was ? WESON  --  I thought maybe Mr. Roylston  --  BENTON  --  He is n't up yet . Want to see him about anything ? WESON  --  Nothin ' special . When I first come out this mornin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like . Soon s'he seen me he turned round and walked off s'fast s'he could go . " D' you think this is a park ? " I shouts after him , but he did n't pay no attention . Thinks I : I better tell Mr. Roylston about you . With all them burglaries happenin ' near-abouts you ca n't be too careful . p. 35 BENTON  --  Hm  --  you 're right about that . ( with an involuntary glance at the hat ) Mr. Roylston ought to be more careful . WESON  --  Oughter hire a watchman , s'what I say . ( in a whining voice ) T'ai n't safe for me sleepin ' all alone in that house at the end of the drive . S'me they 'd tackle first . I was readin ' in the papers t' other day where robbers tortured an old gardener same s'me to make him tell them how to git into the house ; burned his bare feet with a red-hot poker ! ( with rising inflection ) Ai n't that turrible ? BENTON  --  Oh , I guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't burglars his nibs ought to be frightened of . WESON  --  ( eagerly , scenting a scandal ) What 's he been up to now ? BENTON  --  ( picks up Mrs. Frazer 's hat ) Cast your eye on this . WESON  --  Wait till I git my specs. ( reaches into his pocket and pulls out a pair of steel-rimmed spectacles ) I ca n't see nothin ' without ' em no more . ( puts them on and looks at the hat ,  --  in disappointed tones ) What 's that ? One of the Missus ' hats ? p. 36 BENTON  --  Guess again . She do n't wear cheap truck like that . ( throws hat contemptuously on sofa ) WESON  --  You do n't mean  --  ? ( with an explosive chuckle ) If he do n't beat the devil ! An ' the Missus in Noo York ! Makes hay while the sun shines , do n't he ? Do n't the Missus never guess nothin ' ? BENTON  --  ( scornfully ) She does n't know enough ; besides usually he chucks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have them crazy about him but when they get too mushy  --  he does n't like complications  --  they interfere with his work , he says ; and then when they call up I have to say he 's too busy to be disturbed . WESON  --  ( admiringly ) Foxy , ai n't he ? BENTON  --  I do n't know what 's wrong with him this time . I do n't blame him , though ; she 's a beauty . But he ought to be more careful . Once caught , twice shy , they say ; and he was caught once , good and proper . ( with a short laugh ) It 'll do the Missus good to get a dose of her own medicine . It broke the old man 's heart when the young fellow married her , and  --  ( stopping abruptly as he sees how avidly Weson is drinking his words in ) A fine man to work for , the old gentleman ; not that I 'm complaining of the son at all . p. 37 WESON  --  What was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that an old scandalmonger like you ought to hear . There 's lots of things I could tell if I had a mind to ; but I 'll keep my mouth shut . It 's the best policy , Weson , especially when you 're around . You better get out of here . I think I hear someone coming down the stairs . ( Weson hurriedly withdraws . Benton goes to the table and pretends to be arranging the things on it . Mrs. Frazer appears in the doorway on the left . She stops uncertainly when she sees Benton . ) BENTON  --  ( affably ) Good morning , ma'am . MRS . FRAZER  --  ( embarrassed ) Good morning . I believe I left my hat in here . BENTON  --  Yes , ma'am . Here it is . ( He picks her hat from the sofa . ) MRS . FRAZER  --  ( walking over and taking it from him ) Thank you . ( She goes to the window and stands drinking in the beauty of the Spring morning . ) BENTON  --  ( with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beautiful morning , ma'am . p. 38 MRS . FRAZER  --  Yes , is n't it ? And what a lovely garden . BENTON  --  Yes , ma'am , very fine . It has the gardener busy all the time keeping it in shape . MRS . FRAZER  --  No doubt ; they require a great deal of care . Has Mr. Roylston come down yet ? BENTON  --  Lord no , ma'am ; wo n't be down for an hour yet , I should say . He 's not what you 'd call an early bird ; stays up so late nights he could n't be . ( insinuatingly ) But he 's been so queer and  --  hm  --  different from what he usually does , he might do anything this morning . MRS . FRAZER  --  ( crushing him with a look of icy hauteur ) What do you mean ? BENTON  --  ( confused , fumbling with the books on the table ) Nothing at all , ma'am , only  --  MRS .

Now , when the others  --  p. 39 MRS . FRAZER  --  ( horrified ) Others ? BENTON  --  ( grinning ) Loads of ' em . They 're all crazy about him . He likes it , too  --  phone calls and letters and flowers and all such stuff . He pretends not to care , but it tickles him just the same to have them adoring him , asking for his advice  --  MRS . FRAZER  --  Stop ! Is this the way you slander the man who trusts you ? BENTON  --  ( offended ) It 's no secret . He laughs and talks about it himself . I 've heard him read parts of the letters to the Missus , Mrs. Roylston . I was only saying it to you because it 's never  --  he 's never taken any chances for the others . I thought you 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . FRAZER  --  ( her face crimson ) How dare you ! BENTON  --  ( quickly ) Beg your pardon , ma'am , no offence intended . ( slyly ) Of course I do n't mean anything wrong . ( The sound of a door closing is heard from the hallway on the left , then children 's voices . Benton turns excitedly to Mrs. Frazer . ) Good Gawd , it must be Mrs. Roylston and the kids . Go in there where she wo n't see you . ( Mrs. Frazer , too overcome with fear and shame to stop and think , hurries through the door at the rear . Benton closes it after her and is busy with the papers on the table when Mrs. Roylston enters with the children who are talking and laughing together . ( Mrs. Roylston is a pretty woman of thirty or so , with a mass of light curly brown hair , big thoughtful eyes , rosy complexion , tiny hands and feet , and a slight girlish figure . She is dressed stylishly but without ostentation . ( Davie and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , noisy , delightful children . Their clothes are simple but of expensive material. ) p. 40 MRS . ROYLSTON  --  Good morning , Benton . Mr. Roylston 's not up yet of course ? BENTON  --  No , ma'am . MRS . ROYLSTON  --  Telephone for Dr. Morse at once , will you , Benton ? Tell him to come up at once . BENTON  --  Yes , ma'am . Nothing serious , I hope ma'am . MRS . ROYLSTON  --  Oh no . Ruth was ill last night when we returned from the theatre . Mrs. Dexter sent for her doctor . He said it was nothing but  --  ( smiling and shaking an accusing finger at Ruth ) too much candy . However , I wanted to make sure . I have no confidence in strange doctors . So I took the first train out this morning and did n't wait for the machine . RUTH  --  I did'n eat much , Mother .

I should have had the courage to refuse then ; but I did n't . It all seemed such a wonderful dream come true , I just could n't refuse even when I knew I was wronging him .

I was considered a fine stenographer in those days and my salary was enough to keep us going . Then , too , he had to have someone to typewrite his manuscripts for him . MRS . FRAZER  --  ( with wondering admiration ) And you did all that ? MRS . ROYLSTON  --  I had plenty of time at night to typewrite what he had written during the day . Those were the happiest days of my life . How often since then I 've wished that he had never been successful , that we could have gone on like that always .

I knew he would come to regret his sacrifice and I would become a dead weight holding him back . I knew nothing of what he knew . Whatever I have learned since , he has taught me . We had been married a little over a year when his first play was produced and made a sensation ,  --  and then  --  p. 53 MRS . FRAZER  --  ( eagerly ) Yes ? MRS . ROYLSTON  --  ( softly ) Little Davie came . I could n't think of going away then . It would have killed me . I was n't strong enough or brave enough for that . I hoped he would love me more for Davie 's sake , and he did for a time . He was so kind to me ; and when our little girl was born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had less and less time to spend at home , and he hated to be disturbed when he was writing . He met so many people , women , of his own kind outside , who could talk about the things he was interested in , that I guess he commenced to despise me a little because I was so stupid . MRS . FRAZER  --  ( with a strange smile , half to herself ) No , no , he has never analyzed his home relations . MRS . ROYLSTON  --  ( as if she had not heard ) Lately he has grown more and more indifferent to me and to the children ; so that now I 'm afraid he only looks on me as a sort of housekeeper . ( with a pitiful attempt at a smile ) He 'll have to acknowledge I 'm a good one . I 've protected him from all the small worries he detests so much . I do n't believe he realizes ; he thinks things just run along by themselves . MRS . FRAZER  --  ( eagerly ) Why have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual ? Why have you never spoken to him , told him how you felt ? You have seen him slipping away and made no attempt to hold him . p. 54 MRS . ROYLSTON  --  ( fiercely ) I have loved him , loved him , loved him with all my heart and soul ; loved him more than you or any other woman will ever love him . If that has no power to hold him ,  --  then I have lost him . MRS . FRAZER  --  ( after a pause ) How unhappy you must have been ! MRS . ROYLSTON  --  ( scornfully ) Unhappy ? So that 's what you think ! How little you know ! I have been happy in serving him , happy in the knowledge that I have had my little part in helping him to success , happy to be able to shield and protect him . In spite of all you other women with your letters and flowers , I have been happy . ( with a sad smile ) However , it 's all ended now . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you others , as long as I was sure he did n't suspect I knew about you , I could remain and love him and still preserve my self-respect . It 's different now . I ca n't pretend to be blind any longer . I know , and you know I know , and he knows I know . Besides I see that his future happiness does not depend on me and ( intensely ) above all else in the world I want him to be happy . MRS . FRAZER  --  But he is happy  --  now  --  with you ! MRS . ROYLSTON  --  ( shaking her head sadly ) My usefullness is past . I can only thank God for granting the beauty and joy of the past eleven years to a woman who sinned and was too cowardly to pay . The payment was never cancelled , only postponed , I see that now  --  postponed until I had the courage to pay . I have that courage now . I will pay . I will leave him to his happiness . ( her voice thrilling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much as that ? Not many , or one , I think . How many of you would make the sacrifice I will make ? How many of you would be willing to give him up to another woman because your love was so great ? Not one of you ! ( bitterly ) You the least of all  --  for him or anyone else ! I can see it in your face . p. 55 MRS . FRAZER  --  ( slowly ) It is true . Compared to you I am a weakling . MRS . ROYLSTON  --  I do not boast of my strength , only of the strength of my love . I thank you just the same . You are the only person who has ever given me credit for being what I must be . Not even he ever saw it in all these eleven years . MRS . FRAZER  --  But did you ever lay bare your soul to anyone , even to him , as you have to me ? MRS . ROYLSTON  --  Yes , to him , every day , every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FRAZER  --  ( after a pause  --  thoughtfully ) How much you have taught me ! Happiness , then , means servitude ? MRS . ROYLSTON  --  Love means servitude ; and my love is my happiness . MRS . FRAZER  --  I should have come to you for advice , not to him . MRS . ROYLSTON  --  ( with a scornful smile ) Advice ? That word has been my torturer . You women of the flowers and letters have stolen him from me in the name of advice . MRS . FRAZER  --  ( hurt ) Even now you have no faith in me. p. 56 MRS . ROYLSTON  --  It is n't possible . How can I ? How can I ? MRS . FRAZER  --  I ca n't blame you ; things are so mixed . It must appear incredible . But ca n't you see that I , too , have suffered ? Even if what you think were true could you not pity me ? MRS . ROYLSTON  --  ( excitedly ) No , no , no . I can only hate you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much . MRS . FRAZER  --  ( rising from her chair ) I can not wait any longer . I must go out into the fresh air and be alone for a while  --  to think . MRS . ROYLSTON  --  You are afraid to wait until he comes . MRS . FRAZER  --  I will wait outside . In this room the weight of your suspicion is crushing me . I begin to feel guilty . MRS . ROYLSTON  --  ( savagely ) Ah ! MRS . FRAZER  --  ( weakly ) I will wait outside in the garden if I may . ( She starts to go . The sound of a door slamming is heard . Mrs. Roylston goes to the door on the left and looks out . She gives an exclamation of surprise . ) MRS . ROYLSTON  --  ( slowly ) He has just come in . He must have been out for his morning walk . What could have got him up so early ? ( turns impetuously to Mrs. Frazer ) You must have known of this ; and you wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lies everywhere ! p. 57 MRS . FRAZER  --  ( distractedly ) No , no , I swear to you  --  MRS . ROYLSTON  --  Ssshh ! Here he comes . ( Roylston enters from the door on the left . He is dressed exactly the same as the night before . ) ROYLSTON  --  ( concealing his annoyance ) Hello , Alice , what brings you back at this unearthly hour ? Good morning , Mrs. Frazer . MRS . ROYLSTON  --  ( falteringly ) Ruth was sick last night and I did n't wait for the machine this morning but hurried out on the first train . She seems to be all right this morning but I 've sent for Dr. Morse to make sure . ROYLSTON  --  ( indifferently , shrugging his shoulders ) Stuffed full of candy , probably . I see you and Mrs. Frazer have already made each other 's acquaintance . MRS . ROYLSTON  --  ( with a short laugh at what she thinks is his attempt to deceive her in the name ) Oh , yes . ( Mrs. Frazer does not reply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the first time . ) ROYLSTON  --  ( searching through the things on the table ) God be thanked I have n't a jealous wife ; for I must acknowledge that even to the most unprejudiced observer the events of last night would appear dubious . ( irritably ) Where did Benton put  --  ? Oh , here it is. ( finds the fountain pen he has been looking for and puts it in his pocket ) You see Mrs. Frazer missed the last train and when I explained that you were away it was all I could do to persuade her to occupy Guest Chamber No. 1 instead of melting to death in the rain . Nice situation , was n't it ? Nothing if not compromising . Married man , married lady  --  not to each other  --  lonely country house  --  stormy night  --  wife returns home unexpectedly the next morning and  --  does not believe the worst . ( with a laugh which has a trace of mockery in it ) My dear Alice , you are really the perfect wife . ( goes over to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the same bantering tone ) I told you , Mrs. Frazer , that Caesar 's wife was above harboring suspicion . I welcome you to the model household , where truth reigns , where conventions are as naught , where we believe in each other implicitly because we have found each other so worthy of belief . And I salute you , My Angel of Trustfulness . ( He bends to kiss his wife . She gently pushes him away. ) p. 58 MRS . ROYLSTON  --  Do n't , David , please ! ROYLSTON  --  ( glancing from one to the other . Mrs. Frazer is looking at him with frank disgust . ) Hm  --  I was too hasty in my reliance on mutual confidence it seems . You two have had a run-in already , I see . ( to his wife , impatiently ) I am sorry you should have jumped at conclusions before you heard my explanation . Mrs. Frazer is going to do some work for me and  --  MRS . ROYLSTON  --  ( her eyes filling ) Ah . ROYLSTON  --  Which will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must clear away all unpleasantness  --  MRS . FRAZER  --  ( interrupting him coldly ) You are mistaken . I have decided I can not accept the work you offer me . ROYLSTON  --  ( perplexed ) Hm ,  --  it 's as bad as that , eh ? MRS . ROYLSTON  --  ( turning to Mrs. Frazer ) But you must ! MRS . FRAZER  --  ( indignantly ) Must ? MRS . ROYLSTON  --  What good can your refusal do now ? p. 59 MRS . FRAZER  --  ( to Roylston ) Your wife has plainly told me that she is firmly convinced I am your mistress . She has read letters to you from someone and thinks I am the author . You see how plainly impossible it would be for me to work for you or accept your assistance in any way . Besides , there are other reasons . I have made a mistake , a great mistake , and it only remains for me to go . Before I leave I should like to have you try to convince Mrs. Roylston that her suspicions are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  ( turning to his wife ) So you read my letters ? MRS . ROYLSTON  --  Yes ; you left them on your table and I  --  could n't resist the temptation . ( Roylston turns away from her contemptuously . ) I saw I was losing you , that you were becoming indifferent to me and the children  --  ROYLSTON  --  And you thought opening my letters would cure that ? MRS . ROYLSTON  --  They were already open . ROYLSTON  --  Reading them , then . MRS . ROYLSTON  --  I did not stop to think . I love you . ROYLSTON  --  ( coldly ) Indeed ? You have strange ways of showing it . p. 60 MRS . ROYLSTON  --  I wanted to fight for you . I had to know who my enemy was . ROYLSTON  --  Well , who was this so-called enemy of yours ? MRS . ROYLSTON  --  The letters were signed : Julia Wainright . MRS . FRAZER  --  ( eagerly ) You see ! ROYLSTON  --  What has she to do with Mrs. Frazer ? Why , in heaven 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Mrs. Frazer are unpardonable and nonsensical . You are letting a narrow-minded suspicion blot out all that is best in you . Appearances have been against me before and yet you never took this attitude . MRS . ROYLSTON  --  There is such a thing as the last straw . ROYLSTON  --  ( sternly ) Alice , what has come over you ? You are not yourself . When I tell you we are both blameless do you still persist  --  MRS . ROYLSTON  --  ( frenziedly ) I do n't believe you or her or anyone . I ca n't , I ca n't ! You call her Mrs. Frazer and expect me to believe her innocent  --  and she wears no wedding ring . ( Mrs. Frazer instinctively hides her hand behind her back . ) Why are you up and out so early ? You never get up before ten  --  Because she is up ! p. 61 MRS . FRAZER  --  ( growing crimson ) Oh ! ( The doorbell is heard ringing . ) ROYLSTON  --  ( bitingly ) You need not tell your woes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself . Here comes Benton . ( A moment later Benton appears in the doorway . ) BENTON  --  Dr. Morse is here , ma'am . MRS . ROYLSTON  --  ( faintly ) Very well , Benton . Tell him I 'll be right out ; and call the children in . BENTON  --  Yes , ma'am . ( He goes out . ) ROYLSTON  --  ( turning to his wife  --  cuttingly ) Your conduct has been rather a revelation to me . MRS . ROYLSTON  --  ( wincing ) Do n't , David ! ROYLSTON  --  You have called me a liar and you have insulted Mrs. Frazer who is my friend . ( Mrs. Frazer makes an angry gesture repudiating this statement . ) You will have no cause for any suspicions in the future for I shall not trouble you with my presence in this house any longer . I will have Benton pack up my things at once . I do not care to live with a wife who is also an evil-minded spy . I could vindicate myself beyond all possibility of doubt , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever your jealous whim dictates . I will explain to Mrs. Frazer and she may tell you if she considers your charges against her worth the trouble of refuting. p. 62 MRS . ROYLSTON  --  ( shrinking from him as if he had struck her ) Do n't , do n't David ! Please do n't speak like that  --  to me . You are killing me . I love you , you must not go away . This is your home . It is I who have no reason here . I will give you ( sobbing and walking toward the door on the left ) your freedom . I want you to be happy , and  --  I know I 'm only in your way  --  now . Please forgive me if I ca n't believe . ( stretching out her arms to him supplicatingly ) Please forgive me ! ( He turns away from her coldly . ) MRS . FRAZER  --  ( indignantly ) For shame , Mr. Roylston ! MRS . ROYLSTON  --  ( turning to her furiously ) How dare you intercede for me ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She rushes out the door to the left as SCENE  --  The same . Roylston and Mrs. Frazer are still staring at the door through which Mrs. Roylston has just gone . ROYLSTON  --  ( shrugging his shoulders turns to Mrs. F. with a short laugh ) I have lived with that woman for eleven years , and have never known her until ten minutes ago . ( Benton appears in the doorway to the left . He stands there irresolutely for a second and is turning to go out again when Roylston sees him . ) ROYLSTON  --  ( sharply ) Well , Benton ? What is it ? BENTON  --  ( confused ) Nothing of any importance , sir  --  just something the gardener , Weson , asked me to tell you . ( He hesitates , plainly indicating he does not wish to speak before Mrs. F. ) ROYLSTON  --  ( to Mrs. Frazer ) Excuse me. ( goes over to Benton in the doorway ) Well ? BENTON  --  Weson says he saw a suspicious character hanging around and looking at the house early this morning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he ran away . p. 64 ROYLSTON  --  ( with a groan ) Damn Weson ! Are you never going to get over your idiotic burglar scares , Benton ? BENTON  --  ( darkly ) I was n't thinking of burglars  --  this time . ( with a meaning glance in Mrs. F. 's direction ) Look out for the badger game , sir . ROYLSTON  --  ( irritably ) Go to the devil ! ( Benton smiles craftily and goes out . Rolyston comes back to the table . ) When I outgrew a governess they gave me Benton . I thought it was a change for the better but it was n't . I have never been able to outgrow him . He wo n't let me . ( Mrs. Frazer remains silent . Roylston strides up and down nervously , clasping and unclasping his hands and scowling at his disagreeable thoughts . Suddenly he strikes his fist into the palm of his hand with an impatient exclamation . ) What a blind fool I am ! If there was anything in the world I would have trusted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letters . What a contemptible thing to do  --  to read my letters ! And what a trustful simpleton I was to leave them around ! ( with an ironical smile ) Do you remember what I said last night about not caring to analyze my home relations provided the surface remained smooth ? Well , your visit has stirred up the depths with a vengeance  --  the muddy depths . p. 65 MRS . FRAZER  --  ( sarcastically ) What a crushing blow for you ! ROYLSTON  --  In all seriousness it really is appalling . I feel as if the world were turned topsy-turvy . When you have taken a thing for granted for years , when a faith in it has been one of the main props of your life , although you might not have realized its importance at the time ,  --  and suddenly you make the discovery that you have trusted in a sham , that your prop is worm-eaten !  --  It is rather a rough tumble , is n't it ? MRS . FRAZER  --  ( in the same sarcastic tone ) I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so ; I was forgetting . We 're in the same boat , are n't we ? ( with a sigh ) Well , I shall get bravely over it , as you have escaped from yours . A few bruises , I suppose , must be expected after such a hard fall . MRS . FRAZER  --  Yes , bruises on the soul . ROYLSTON  --  I will have to hunt a new illusion . You remember you said last night that when you came here you feared the crowning disillusionment ? MRS . FRAZER  --  My fears were well grounded . ROYLSTON  --  Hm  --  you mean you have seen my illusion go up in smoke , too ? It is discouraging  --  as if everything in life were founded upon false appearances . ( He quotes ironically ) " Yea , faileth now dream the dreamer and the lute the lutanist. " p. 66 MRS . FRAZER  --  You are deceiving yourself as to the nature of my awakening . I have come to regard the prop , as you call it , which I cast aside with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I find , is worm-eaten . ROYLSTON  --  The new one ? Meaning that I am ? MRS . FRAZER  --  Exactly ! I asked you to guide my future because I thought you were far-sighted . I have discovered you are only in-sighted  --  as pitifully in-sighted as I was . ROYLSTON  --  ( surprised ) In-sighted ? MRS . FRAZER  --  Yes , you see nothing beyond yourself . You are so preoccupied with the workings of your own brain that your vision of outside things is clouded . You are only a cruel egotist . ROYLSTON  --  Know thyself , sayeth the law . MRS . FRAZER  --  You make no allowance for the individual . ROYLSTON  --  Oh , come now , Mrs. Frazer ; you have read what I have written . You know if there is one thing I harp on ad nauseam  --  MRS . FRAZER  --  It is the duty of the individual to triumph over environment ; but in your life you regard yourself as the only individual in the world . You can not see beyond that . You have reconstructed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to force your conception on others ? Why judge their thoughts by what you would think in their place ? When you do so you deprive them of personality . You make them manikins and yourself the master of the show ; and you care not a whit how you hurt their feelings when they fail to answer your pull of the string . p. 67 ROYLSTON  --  ( with a bitter smile ) You , too ? It seems this is my day to be properly humbled in spirit . MRS . FRAZER  --  I know you will never pardon my effrontery in wounding your vanity so . Such colossal conceit ! ROYLSTON  --  ( flushing ) Mrs. Frazer ! MRS . FRAZER  --  ( calmly ) Your cruel vanity has torn off the mask . How could you help me ? You can only help yourself . Perhaps if I were in love with you  --  but then you know , Mr. Narcissus , I would only be your reflection . However , I do not love you . Last night I thought  --  you were on such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the creator , the maker of new values . This morning I saw merely an egotist whose hands are bloody with the human sacrifices he has made  --  to himself ! ROYLSTON  --  ( jumping from his chair  --  excitedly ) You are unjust , Mrs. Frazer . MRS . FRAZER  --  Now you are begining to be angry . ROYLSTON  --  ( indignantly ) Angry ? Why should I be ? You have a perfect right to your opinion , preposterous as it may be . Go on , let me hear the tale of my iniquities . It is very interesting . p. 68 MRS . FRAZER  --  ( teasingly ) You are losing your temper , you spoiled child . ROYLSTON  --  I am not losing my temper . ( pettishly ) I am growing inured to insults this morning . MRS . FRAZER  --  Why , so am I ! I must beg your forgiveness for one thing I said . It was too cruel of me . ( She pauses , smiling mischievously at him . ) ROYLSTON  --  ( sulkily ) To what are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was truthful enough to tell you I did not love you . That was horrible of me . How could you endure hearing a woman say she did not love you ? And how bored you must be when you hear them say they do love you ! Eternal repetition , you know . The petted favorite of fortune stands between the devil and the deep blue sea . ROYLSTON  --  ( angrily ) Mrs. Frazer , these personalities are  --  ( looking at her and catching the twinkle in her eyes  --  with an embarrassed laugh ) I 'm beaten ; I acknowledge defeat . I surrender to the superwoman  --  only do n't hit me when I 'm down . MRS . FRAZER  --  ( contritely ) I should n't have said all this to you , but I had to cure myself of my attack of hero-worship in some way . Besides the wounds I received in this morning 's interview with your wife cried aloud for vengeance . I had to vent my spleen on someone . p. 69 ROYLSTON  --  ( bitterly ) I shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hospitality . It was shameful of her . MRS . FRAZER  --  ( sternly ) No , it is shameful of you to speak of her in that way . She is not to blame for her suspicions . She loves you : how could she help thinking what she did ? She is the most wonderful woman I have ever known  --  worlds above poor blind selfish creatures like you and me . ROYLSTON  --  I am afraid I can not see it in that light . MRS . FRAZER  --  No , because in this case truth offends your pride and you will not see . You never misunderstood her as grossly as you do at the present moment . ROYLSTON  --  And I think I have only just begun to understand her . MRS . FRAZER  --  Take care ! You are doing exactly what you rail against in others  --  judging by appearances . Is the keen analytical eye obstinately closed by wounded vanity ? ROYLSTON  --  ( impatiently ) No , no  --  but my letters ? MRS . FRAZER  --  With such a wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  ( scornfully ) Right ? p. 70 MRS . FRAZER  --  You 'll admit that needless cruelty is wrong , I hope ? ROYLSTON  --  Yes , but I do n't see what  --  MRS . FRAZER  --  Do you love this woman of the letters ? ROYLSTON  --  No , of course not ! MRS . FRAZER  --  Yet you persuaded her to leave her home  --  ROYLSTON  --  Persuaded ? No , certainly not ! She came to me for advice . She had been impressed by what I had written about the narrowing influence of the conventional home . She had practically the same environment you described to me as yours before your marriage . She was engaged to be married to some cut-and-dried young simpleton . Her life was unsatisfying , gave her no scope for realizing the best that was in her . I saw she had brains , ability . I advised her to learn some occupation which would make her self-sustaining , and then go out into life and see things for herself . MRS . FRAZER  --  She is young ? ROYLSTON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ROYLSTON  --  Yes . MRS . FRAZER  --  You are sure you are not in love with her ? p. 71 ROYLSTON  --  ( irritably ) I am sure , yes ! ( with a bored smile ) I have been too busy to love anyone . MRS . FRAZER  --  But yourself . Then you have not even that justification . ROYLSTON  --  ( coldly ) I see no necessity for justifying my actions . MRS . FRAZER  --  You can not deny this girl loves you ? ROYLSTON  --  ( cynically ) She may think she does . MRS . FRAZER  --  And you think she does ! It tickles your vanity to think so . ROYLSTON  --  You are breaking me on the wheel . ( He laughs helplessly . ) MRS . FRAZER  --  You are a poor blind bat , not a butterfly ; you can stand it . It may open your eyes . Ca n't you see that you have forever ruined all chance of her being happy with her cut-and-dried simpleton or any of his kind ? And where is she to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what a disappointment ! What an awakening when she really came to know you ! ROYLSTON  --  ( forcing a laugh and looking down at his feet ) Poor clay feet ! p. 72 MRS . FRAZER  --  There is only one salvation for her . You must write to her at once and say  --  ( She hesitates . ) ROYLSTON  --  Say what ? MRS . FRAZER  --  Reveal your true self . ROYLSTON  --  ( smiling confidently ) You guarantee that will cure the infatuation ? MRS . FRAZER  --  Absolutely ! ROYLSTON  --  Are you sure she wo n't read her ideal into my words ? MRS . FRAZER  --  ( biting her lip ) Perhaps you are right . That wo n't do . I must go to her and tell her  --  ROYLSTON  --  She would think you were jealous . She would not believe you . MRS . FRAZER  --  Tell her flatly you do n't love her . ROYLSTON  --  How about needless cruelty ? MRS . FRAZER  --  ( alarmed ) But you see yourself you must end it someway . ROYLSTON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried and proved by experience . MRS . FRAZER  --  ( scornfully ) I have no doubt . p. 73 ROYLSTON  --  ( in a bantering tone ) Shall I tell you what it is ? Do n't try to look so indifferent . You know you 're dying with curiosity . ( Mrs. Frazer shakes her head indignantly . ) Well , I write a letter to this effect : " I love you but we must see each other no more . " MRS . FRAZER  --  ( contemptuously ) Oh ! ROYLSTON  --  ( continues with a great show of affected pathos ) I can not make you unhappy . Our love is forbidden by cruel , man-made laws and it is on your frail shoulders their punishment would fall , etc. , ad nauseam . So you must forget me  --  or rather , do not forget . Remember in my heart of hearts , my soul of souls , etc. , ad lib , your image will remain , the inspiration of my work ; that in spirit all my work will be dedicated to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  That is disgusting drivel . ROYLSTON  --  Of course it is ! But do n't you know , have n't you ever been in love ? MRS . FRAZER  --  Why ? ROYLSTON  --  Love is the world upside down . Sense is drivel and drivel is sense . MRS . FRAZER  --  You mean to tell me she will be ridiculous enough to believe that ? p. 74 ROYLSTON  --  She will revel in it . She will telephone  --  I can not be found . She will write  --  no answer . She may even try to see me  --  I am invisible . Then she will say : That wonderful man has the strength to sacrifice himself for my sake . Voila ! She goes home , marries the cut-and-dried simpleton , adopts a superior air which holds him in awed servitude , pities him  --  pity is love without jealousy  --  and whenever his uncouth matter-of-factness grates on her sensitive nerves she reverently takes my image from the inner shrine and indulges in the sweet happiness of melancholy retrospection . The memory of another 's sacrifice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narcotic a woman can possess . I recommend it to you . MRS . FRAZER  --  ( dryly ) Thank you . ROYLSTON  --  ( enthusiastically ) Just think of the ecstatic joy of a woman grown old and fat when she remembers that in her younger days a discarded lover committed suicide because she refused him . What a recompense for a double chin the memory of such a corpse must be ! MRS . FRAZER  --  ( controlling an impulse to laugh  --  coldly ) I was attempting to consider this matter seriously . ROYLSTON  --  What ! Consider love seriously ? Set your mind at rest . I have written the letter and I have ordered Benton to stifle the appeals of the telephone . You see you need not have warned me. p. 75 MRS . FRAZER  --  She had become serious , then ? ROYLSTON  --  Why do you say that ? MRS . FRAZER  --  When they become serious you grow afraid of complications . A little bird told me . ROYLSTON  --  A little bird ? MRS . FRAZER  --  A man is never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Valet ! That scoundrel Benton ! The model of discretion . Another illusion gone ! My house of cards is tumbling about my ears . MRS . FRAZER  --  No more than you deserve . ROYLSTON  --  I admit it , Mrs. Frazer. ( eagerly ) I may mock but I see it just the same . In the future I will send my tickled vanity a-packing and have done with such foolishness . After all , it was only an amusing flirtation  --  nothing more . MRS . FRAZER  --  Go and tell Mrs. Roylston that . ROYLSTON  --  ( his expression growing hard and cold ) Thank you for reminding me . ( He goes to the electric bell-button in the wall near the door on left . ) MRS . FRAZER  --  ( anxiously ) What are you going to do ? p. 76 ROYLSTON  --  Ring for Benton to pack my things . MRS . FRAZER  --  Please do n't ! ROYLSTON  --  Why not ? MRS . FRAZER  --  ( pleadingly ) Not yet at any rate . Please sit down again . I have something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Whatever you may say , Mrs. Frazer , will not alter my opinion in the least . I have my own ideas of the way Alice has acted and what I must do . With your permission I will go back to New York on the train with you . MRS . FRAZER  --  No , no , no ! Think of how that would hurt her ? Have you no pity ? I will not allow it . Furthermore you will never see me again when I leave this house . I have been the cause of too much unhappiness already . ROYLSTON  --  Do n't accuse yourself . I have only gratitude to you for opening my eyes , and I want to help you in every way as I promised I would . MRS . FRAZER  --  ( vehemently ) No ! ROYLSTON  --  Surely you do n't mean you refuse  --  MRS . FRAZER  --  Yes , I refuse your assistance in any way , shape or manner . I am not going to take any position and I will not need your help ; so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as for opening your eyes you have never been as sightless as you are now , poor blind mole ! p. 77 ROYLSTON  --  ( with smiling protest ) Odious comparisons ! First I am a bat , then a mole ! MRS . FRAZER  --  Would you like to see clearly ? ROYLSTON  --  Granted that I am blind  --  will sight make me any the less miserable ? MRS . FRAZER  --  ( enthusiastically ) It will make you happy , truly happy . ( R. smiles skeptically . ) Have I your permission to teach you the lesson I was given this morning . ROYLSTON  --  ( frowning ) Lesson ? MRS . FRAZER  --  Yes , a lesson in life your wife gave me this morning . ROYLSTON  --  ( icily ) My wife also gave me a lesson in life , if you will remember . ( dryly ) Her first lesson was not so pleasing that I crave for a second . MRS . FRAZER  --  For her sake , for my sake , for your own sake you must . ROYLSTON  --  ( indifferently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair . ) In the meantime Benton can be packing up my things . p. 78 MRS . FRAZER  --  No , please , not yet . Hear me out first  --  then pack away if you still care to . ( He hesitates uncertainly . ) Come , I ask it as a favor . ( He sits down in his chair again . ) ROYLSTON  --  I warn you , Mrs. Frazer , I am not to be cajoled into altering my plans . You are wasting your time and eloquence . MRS . FRAZER  --  We shall see . Remember you are to hear me from begining to end  --  of the lesson . All ready ? When I came down this morning I found the irreproachable Benton in this room . ROYLSTON  --  And he showed you the crack in my armor . MRS . FRAZER  --  He convinced me , without meaning to do so , that the idol 's feet were  --  well  --  at least only plated . ROYLSTON  --  ( sarcastically ) Of course , he meant well . MRS . FRAZER  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convictions as to my status in this household , and when I saw him growing confidential I did not attempt to show him his mistake . ROYLSTON  --  ( accusingly ) You wanted to listen to his gossip ? MRS . FRAZER  --  ( with a frank laugh ) I wanted to play detective and find out if my you was the real you . Benton , having approved of your choice of a mistress , flattered me by revealing the fact that you had never cared enough for any of the others to dare to install them in your household . p. 79 ROYLSTON  --  ( raging ) The evil-minded wretch ! Others , indeed ! I tell you that there never have been any others in the sense he meant . And you allowed him to talk to you like that ? MRS . FRAZER  --  I was making an ineffectual attempt to put him in his place when we heard Mrs. Roylston coming in with the children . And what do you think I did ?  --  I , the bold emancipated woman ? I ran and hid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I regained control of myself I was furious , and to prove I was not a coward I came in to face your wife . I went to the other extreme in my display of daring . She was not certain I had been here all night but I immediately told her the truth of the whole affair . ROYLSTON  --  What else could you have done ? MRS . FRAZER  --  Oh , I could have lied a little for the good of her soul . Just consider how damning the facts are ! She returns unexpectedly to find me sneaking out of a darkened room , the picture of guilt . I brazenly acknowledge I have been here all night and tell her an absurd story of missing a train , and so forth . She has read letters and  --  ROYLSTON  --  ( impatiently ) I know how sadly the circumstantial evidence is against the truth . I was relying on the implicit trust she has always seemed to have for me. p. 80 MRS . FRAZER  --  Trust ? After she had read those letters  --  letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentioned them to her ? Trust ! You want an angel for a wife , not a human being . ROYLSTON  --  She had no business to read those letters . The whole thing rests upon that . MRS . FRAZER  --  You had no business to receive the letters . The whole thing rests upon that . But to go on with my lesson : I asserted my innocence . Your wife refused to believe me  --  naturally enough . She spoke despondently of having expected something of the sort for a long time because you had been growing indifferent to her and the children . ROYLSTON  --  ( indignantly ) That is not so . It 's true I have n't had much time . I have been very busy , but  --  MRS . FRAZER  --  ( looking at him searchingly ) Are you sure what you are saying now is the truth . Come , be frank ! Remember your statement to me last night when I asked you if you loved her . ROYLSTON  --  ( after a pause  --  grudgingly ) Well , I confess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  MRS . FRAZER  --  She said she blamed no one but herself for what had happened . How could it be expected that a brilliant genius like you could continue to love a poor ignorant creature like herself ? p. 81 ROYLSTON  --  ( a bit shamefaced ) She said that ? MRS . FRAZER  --  Those are almost her exact words . She blamed herself for marrying you in the first place . Marriages like yours were cursed , she thought . ROYLSTON  --  Marriages like ours ? MRS . FRAZER  --  ( meaningly  --  looking steadily into his eyes ) She told me of the events which preceded your marriage  --  of the discovery of your love affair . ROYLSTON  --  ( gripping the arms of his chair tensely , and speaking hoarsely ) Good God , she told you that ! Poor Alice ! ( half to himself ) What could have made her do that ? MRS . FRAZER  --  She said she thought that perhaps you blamed her for your father 's death . ROYLSTON  --  What an absurd idea ! MRS . FRAZER  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggle with poverty before your first play was produced ; the days when you remained home in the little flat to write while she worked in an office as stenographer . She used to typewrite what you had written during the day when she came home at night  --  after she had cooked dinner and washed the dishes . p. 82 ROYLSTON  --  ( his face slowly flushing crimson ) You are right ! I see what you are driving at . Whatever I am she has made me . I have been forgetting those early days for the past few years . They do not chime well with the tickled vanity . ( with sudden ingenuousness ) But I did used to dry the dishes , you know . MRS . FRAZER  --  ( laughing ) Bravo ! Richard is himself again . You only sold a few articles that first year , she said . ROYLSTON  --  She flattered me . I never sold one . Every cent came through her . MRS . FRAZER  --  She said those days were the happiest of her life . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indifferent , that you had never succeeded and it could always have been as it was in the little flat . ROYLSTON  --  Good heavens , she was nothing but a slave in those days . MRS . FRAZER  --  She knew how hard it must have been for you , who had been used to having everything , to have her drag you down into privation and  --  ROYLSTON  --  ( deeply moved ) What a horribly mistaken thought ! I joyed in losing everything for her . It was like paying off part of my debt . p. 83 MRS . FRAZER  --  ( continuing as if he had not interrupted ) So she resolved that as soon as your first book or play was published or produced , and you did not need her any longer , she would leave you , permit you to regain your freedom . ROYLSTON  --  ( stupefied  --  his voice trembling ) Why that 's what she proposed to do  --  for me  --  when she was here a little while ago ! MRS . FRAZER  --  Oh yes , she only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , she is perfectly willing to give you up to me  --  because she loves you so much . ROYLSTON  --  How is it possible to lose oneself like that  --  I can not grasp it  --  there is too much clay in my make-up  --  For me , too ! Good heavens ! She intended to leave me when my first play was produced , you say ? But she did n't . MRS . FRAZER  --  For a very good reason . It was about that time your son was born , was n't it ? ROYLSTON  --  ( getting up from his chair and walking nervously about the room  --  in great agitation ) I see , I see ! Poor Alice ! What a woman she is ! And I  --  good heavens ! You threatened to open my eyes  --  I 've lived with her all these years and forgotten how much I owed to her . She has protected and shielded me from everything  --  made my opportunity for me , you might say  --  and I took it all for granted  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ granted without a thought of gratitude , as my due . Lord , what a cad I 've been ! What a rotten cad ! ( He throws himself into the chair and stares moodily before him. ) p. 84 MRS . FRAZER  --  ( with a faint smile ) I 'd like to deny your statement but I 'm afraid it 's only too true . ROYLSTON  --  What I can not get through my head is why she should tell you all this . Alice is proud . To reveal all this to you , a stranger  --  it must have humbled her spirit to the breaking point . MRS . FRAZER  --  I can not quite understand , myself . She wished to justify you , of course , to prove you were in no way to blame . ROYLSTON  --  ( groaning ) Oh ! MRS . FRAZER  --  You see she persisted in regarding this misfortune as the retribution for her sin in the beginning . ROYLSTON  --  ( jumping up  --  excitedly ) Ah , by heavens , that is going too far ! Retribution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the blame , the sin if it was one , were not all mine ! ( looking at his hands ) Bloody with sacrifices at my own altar  --  yes , you were right  --  and she is the woman whom I tortured with my blind egotism not half an hour ago  --  the woman who pleaded for forgiveness  --  and I refused and was going to desert her . I am beginning to hate myself for a monster ! Those letters ! If any woman ever dares to write to me again I 'll have her letters burned by the  --  no , we have n't one  --  I 'll hand them over to the police . ( Mrs. Frazer bursts out laughing . ) And my children  --  Good God , do you know the horrible thought came to me just now that I do not even know my own children ? p. 85 MRS . FRAZER  --  ( protestingly ) Now you are carrying your self-accusation too far . ROYLSTON  --  ( vehemently ) I tell you it 's the truth . I speak to them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for other people 's . For all the loving interest I have taken in them they might just as well be the gardener 's  --  or Benton 's . MRS . FRAZER  --  You have the whole future before you for retribution . ROYLSTON  --  ( catching at the word eagerly ) Yes , retribution , joyful retribution every day , every hour ! Pay off a part of this enormous debt of love which has accumulated against me ! Why , life is going to mean more , be finer and happier than I ever dreamed ! MRS . FRAZER  --  Happiness is servitude . ROYLSTON  --  ( enthusiastically ) Of course it is ! Servitude in love , love in servitude ! Logos in Pan , Pan in Logos ! That is the great secret  --  and I never knew ! Thank you , thank you ! But how did you guess it ? MRS . FRAZER  --  Mrs. Roylston told me this morning  --  her lesson in life . ROYLSTON  --  That , too ! Her love is great enough to solve all enigmas . p. 86 MRS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sovereign individual ? The superman ? The great lonely one ? ROYLSTON  --  My love will be a superlove worthy of the superman , and  --  ( hesitating ) Besides this is the exceptional case which proves the contrary rule  --  what are you laughing at ? MRS . FRAZER  --  At your determination to be exceptional though the heavens fall . ROYLSTON  --  ( laughing himself ) I have to be exceptional to be worthy of such an exceptional wife . MRS . FRAZER  --  ( rising from her chair ) And now I must go . My mission is accomplished . ROYLSTON  --  Your mission ? ( The doorbell is heard ringing . ) MRS . FRAZER  --  Remember what you said about fatality ? I am convinced I had to accomplish something here . It was not what I thought it was , but no matter . I , too , have learned the secret . It was my mission to open your eyes  --  and my own . ROYLSTON  --  You are going back to your husband ? MRS . FRAZER  --  Yes , back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like you I had grown so accustomed to the best thing in life that I scorned it . I , too , have my joyful retribution to make , my debt of love to pay . p. 87 ROYLSTON  --  ( going to her and taking her hand ) And how can I ever thank you for my awakening ? MRS . FRAZER  --  The fact that you have wakened is thanks enough . ROYLSTON  --  And will you not become  --  my wife 's friend ? MRS . FRAZER  --  With all my heart  --  if she will allow it . ( Benton appears in the doorway on the left . He is greatly excited . ) BENTON  --  Excuse me , sir , but there 's a man who insisted on seeing you and  --  ( George Frazer pushes Benton roughly aside and steps into the room . He is a man of about thirty-five , thick-set , of medium height , black hair grey at the temples , square jaw , irregular features , broad clean-shaven face , and shrewd blue eyes . His face is haggard and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their consequent sleepless nights . He is dressed in a business suit of dark material . ) FRAZER  --  ( gives a groan of suppressed rage as he sees the two standing together ) Ethel ! MRS . FRAZER  --  George ! ( She makes a movement toward him . He throws himself at Roylston , pulling a revolver from his coat pocket . Mrs. Frazer springs between them. ) p. 88 MRS . FRAZER  --  For my sake ! George ! ( Frazer hurls the revolver on the floor and sinks into the chair by the table , hiding his face in his hands and sobbing heavily . Mrs. Frazer goes to him and puts her arm around his shoulder . He makes a feeble effort to shake her off . Benton creeps stealthily over and picks up the revolver . ) ROYLSTON  --  ( severely ) You may go , Benton . ( Benton looks at him irresolutely , then goes out . Frazer finally regains his composure somewhat and turns his grief-stricken face to his wife . ) FRAZER  --  Ethel  --  why ?  --  My God ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never be cleared up ! ROYLSTON  --  Yes , I will clear it up . FRAZER  --  ( furiously ) Shut up , you  --  . You lie ! I know what I know . You have done me harm enough without trying to treat me like a fool . I 'd have shot you for the skulking liar you are  --  but  --  it was n't for your sake I did n't  --  ROYLSTON  --  ( with calm dignity ) I choose to ignore your insults for the present , Mr. Frazer . When you are calmer you will hear what I have to say and this ludicrous melodrama will end . ( He turns to go out door in back. ) p. 89 MRS . FRAZER  --  No , please stay ; you must . ( R. remains standing by the door . ) MRS . FRAZER  --  ( her voice trembling ) George , how did you find out ? FRAZER  --  I always knew you 'd wind up here sooner or later . Before you left , when I was certain you did n't care for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this ( with bitter scorn ) gentleman . His books , his plays all over the place , his photograph on the middle of your dresser . ( Mrs. Frazer flushes . Roylston looks at her in astonishment . ) That was why I had you followed . MRS . FRAZER  --  ( with a frown ) I thought you had given up spying on me . FRAZER  --  ( pleadingly ) It was n't spying . You must n't think that , Ethel . It was for your own sake I did it . MRS . FRAZER  --  ( with a hard laugh ) For my sake ! FRAZER  --  I wanted to protect you . You do n't know the world . I knew you 'd do something foolish sooner or later with your head full of his crazy ideas . You do n't know the game these gentlemen play . p. 90 ROYLSTON  --  ( angrily ) Oh ! ( He turns and goes out door in rear . ) MRS . FRAZER  --  So I was followed to this house ? FRAZER  --  Yes . MRS . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  ( with a groan ) Yes . MRS . FRAZER  --  How is it you gave up waiting for me ? Why have n't you tried to see me yourself  --  it 's nearly two months . FRAZER  --  I could see you did n't want me bothering you  --  and I 've been sick . MRS . FRAZER  --  ( alarmed ) Sick ? FRAZER  --  ( lightly ) Nothing serious  --  overwork  --  nervous breakdown , the doctor said . Had to go to bed  --  he prescribed perfect rest . ( ironically ) Perfect rest ! MRS . FRAZER  --  ( with tender anxiety ) But you 're all right now , de  --  ( She bites back the term of endearment at his wondering look . ) George ? FRAZER  --  ( sarcastically ) Fine  --  as you can see . p. 91 MRS . FRAZER  --  Why could n't you have sent me word ? It would have changed things so . FRAZER  --  You mean you would n't be here ? Well , I could n't . I did n't want you to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think you 'd care . MRS . FRAZER  --  ( wincing ) Oh . ( after a pause ) Why did you come here this morning ? FRAZER  --  The detective telephoned me  --  when he was sure . I wanted to kill this man and you too , at first . I did n't know what I was doing . MRS . FRAZER  --  ( sadly ) And now I suppose it 's all over  --  forever  --  between us . You ca n't want me any longer  --  believing what you do . FRAZER  --  ( turning away from her to hide his emotion ) Do n't say that , Ethel . I ca n't give you up  --  this way . Life is too  --  hard to bear  --  without you . I ca n't help loving you  --  in spite of everything . I should n't  --  I suppose  --  now . ( Mrs. Frazer is looking at him with eyes full of tenderness . ) If you 'd only  --  love me a little  --  I could forget this foolishness  --  not your fault  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  my fault . ( A sob shakes his shoulders. ) p. 92 MRS . FRAZER  --  ( softly ) So you still want me  --  to come back ? FRAZER  --  Yes  --  that 's why I came  --  to ask you  --  if you would . MRS . FRAZER  --  ( kneeling down beside him  --  eagerly ) Then look into my eyes quick  --  now ! ( He looks down at her . ) I swear to you I am innocent  --  that I love you more now than I ever did , even on our honeymoon ; and I am as innocent of wrong now as I was then . Can you believe me ? FRAZER  --  ( wonderingly ) Then you do n't love him ? MRS . FRAZER  --  No , no , a thousand times no ! I love you , and he loves his wife . My presence here is folly , nothing more . Let me explain the whole thing to you . FRAZER  --  ( joyfully ) No , no , I believe you without that . ( He takes her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the door on the left . She has a small travelling bag in her hand . Her eyes are red from weeping . She stops in astonishment and her bag drops from her hand when she sees the Frazers . ) MRS . ROYLSTON  --  ( timidly ) I beg your pardon . ( Startled , they both jump to their feet and face Mrs. Roylston in confusion. ) p. 93 MRS . FRAZER  --  ( joyfully ) I want you to meet my husband , Mrs. Roylston . George , this is Mrs. Roylston . MRS . ROYLSTON  --  ( astonished ) I 'm very happy  --  FRAZER  --  A great pleasure , etc . MRS . FRAZER  --  Mrs. Roylston is the most wonderful woman in the world . ( Mrs. Roylston smiles feebly . ) If you do n't believe me , ask her husband . ( as Frazer stammers and Mrs. Roylston is equally nonplussed ) And now you and I will be going  --  home ! ( She walks over toward the door on the left . ) Good-bye , Mrs. Roylston . I hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( She holds out her  --  hand which Mrs. Roylston takes uncertainly as if in a daze . ) Come , George , out into the open air . I have so much to say to you . ( She goes out . Frazer follows her but stops at the door and turns to Mrs. Roylston . ) FRAZER  --  Mrs. Roylston , will you tell your husband I wish to take back all I said to him a while ago . He 'll understand . MRS . ROYLSTON  --  ( dully ) I 'll tell him . p. 94 FRAZER  --  Thank you ; good-bye . ( He goes out . A moment later the front door is heard closing . ) MRS . ROYLSTON  --  ( mechanically ) Good-bye . ( She takes her bag and sets it down beside the table ; then sinks wearily into the chair and leans both elbows on the table , holding her face in her hands in an attitude of deep dejection . Roylston enters from the door in the rear . He gives a joyful exclamation on seeing his wife . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ) Alice . MRS . ROYLSTON  --  ( startled , turns and looks up at him  --  dully ) Yes . ROYLSTON  --  They have gone  --  Mr. and Mrs. Frazer  --  together ? MRS . ROYLSTON  --  Yes . ROYLSTON  --  ( jubilantly ) Good ! And without hearing my explanation ! That is a proof of love and trust on his part which I would hardly have expected of him . You see , Alice , the most ludicrous part of this whole misunderstanding is the fact that I did not spend last night in this house . MRS . ROYLSTON  --  ( slowly  --  as if she could not believe her ears ) You  --  were not here ? p. 95 ROYLSTON  --  No . After I directed Mrs. Frazer to her room I ran away  --  spent the night at the roadhouse . I was afraid to stay , I must confess  --  afraid of myself  --  afraid of how the situation might be misconstrued . I did n't want to be the cause of any more trouble to Mrs. Frazer , who had suffered enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with happy tears ) Oh , I 'm so glad ! ROYLSTON  --  I want you to prove my statement  --  to be completely satisfied that I am speaking the truth . My name is on the register at the roadhouse and they all know me and can testify to my story . I wanted to explain before but your doubts hurt my obstinate pride  --  I had boasted to Mrs. Frazer that you would not judge by appearances , you know . As for Frazer 's detective , he must have taken everything for granted  --  as you and all the rest did . I 'll have to write to Frazer and tell him . In spite of his fine confidence there might be some secret suspicions in the back of his mind . MRS . ROYLSTON  --  David  --  forgive me  --  ROYLSTON  --  ( impetuously ) Forgive you ? What nonsense ! ( He bends down to kneel beside her and knocks his knee against her bag . He holds it up wonderingly . ) What 's this ? Your bag all packed ! Then you were really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  ( tremblingly ) I thought you loved her . I wanted you to be happy . ROYLSTON  --  And the children ? MRS . ROYLSTON  --  I had no right  --  It was best for them to stay . ROYLSTON  --  You were going to leave them , too  --  and all for my sake ! Good heavens ! And you ask for forgiveness ! ( kneeling down beside her and putting his arms around her ) Ah , my dear , my dear , how deeply you make me feel my unworthiness ! I am the one who must plead for pardon , pardon for a lifetime of selfish neglect , of vain posing , of stupid conceit  --  MRS . ROYLSTON  --  ( kissing him ) Ssshhh ! ROYLSTON  --  ( his voice vibrating with tenderness ) Dear , the future will be all that the past has not been , I swear it . We start on our honeymoon today  --  a lifelong honeymoon . ( jumping to his feet , with mock severity ) But have n't you read your husband 's books , you wonderful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your duty to claim your right as an individual to shake off the shackles my insufferable egotism had forced upon you ? Do n't you understand that you have stifled your own longings , given up your own happiness that I might feel self-satisfied  --  p. 97 MRS . ROYLSTON  --  ( interrupting him  --  softly and tenderly ) That was my happiness . ( He bends down and kisses her reverently as
