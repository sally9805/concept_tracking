txt John B. Stanchfield of counsel for Henry Siegel and his partner , Frank E. Vogel , against whom indictments charging-felony and misdemeanor already have been returned , went to see District Attorney Whitman about their cases yesterday . Mr. Whitman would not discuss what took place betwee'i him and Mr. Stanchfield . However , the visit to the District Attorney 's office was regarded as significant because it followed closely the arrval in this city of Levy Mayer , a Chcago attorney , representing Mrs. Frank E. Vogel and the Nelson Morris estate . Mr. Mayer during the examination ot . Vogel in bankruptcy proceedings before United - States Commissioner Gilchrist on Wednesday , announced that he was here representing the relatives and friends of Siegel and Vogel , who were " trying to aid these people , " meaning of course , the creditors . After the hearing Mr. Mayer explained that he had been sent to New York to make an investigation of the situation . Last night he issued this statement " I did not come to New York to make any public statement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be interviewed . I find , however , that the situation here , so far as Chit-ago is concerned . and what the families of Vogel and Siegel are doing , is nut at all understood . ' I have no comment whatever to make upon the actions or business reverses of either Mr. Siegel or Mr. Vogel . I do not represent either of them . Those interested in Chicago , however , do wish the public in New York to know that $1,500,000 of money has aiready been raised and contributed by friends and relatives of the two men . A million dollars of this amount was put into Siegel Cooper Company of Chicago to preserve that branch . The money so put in by special contract is I postponed to all other liabilities of the company . By putting in that money it was planned to save the Siegel Cooper Company , whose capital stock , with the exception of i per cent. , belongs to the Siegel Stores Corporation . That company has been making from $300,000 to $400,000 a year with one exception for many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preferred and common stock of the Siegel Stores Corporation has been enhanced largely in- value . No Security Received . " Personally , I would have preferred to Have seen the $1,000,000 paid direct to the Ne:w York depositors , and that , was the professional position I took in discussing the matter in Chicago . Bankers and merchants , however , thought it best to save the Siegel Cooper Company and thus , indirectly , at least , help the depositors . Not one penny of security was received by those who put the $1,000,000 into the Chicago branch . One of the men who contributed $100 , - 000 of that $1,000,000 himself was a private banker , who failed in Chicago in 1$93 . His estate paid about 20 cents . - We have a law in Illinois precisely like yours in New York governing bank deposits . The Chicago party was indicted just as Siegel and Vogel have been indicted . The State 's Attorney , being the equivalent of your District Attorney , did not press the indictment . Upon the assurance of the indicted man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has since paid the balance of every dollar he owed to his depositors . If he had gone to the penitentiary the .. total deposits would have been practically lost to the depositors . " The families of Vogel and Siegel are now ready to furnish an additional ; 500 , - ( 100 , and all of this for the benefit of thej unfortunate depositors . Everybody who knows anything about this failure , knows that Siegel and Vogel are church mouse poor . All of the investigations I and examinations demonstrate that they have not abstracted , secreted , stolen , or concealed a single penny . They poured their own fortunes as they did the moneys of their creditors into this most unfortunate and deadly commercial , financial catastrophe . " Speaking particularly for the relatives of Mr. Vogel , who live in Chicago , they are determined to do all in their power to help the depositors get back the moneys. which these poor , hungry . and unfortunate men , women and children so sorely need . Auxione to Avoid Delay . " We are equally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delay and without court costs and lawyers ' expenses . We are urging that if possible Vogel and Siegel be given a chance to earn and pay up in full the balance remaining unpaid after these family contributions have been made . " We certainly have nothing but words of praise for the official conduct of your public prosecutor . He is doing only his duty as prescribed by law . I am discussing what socially and economically is for the best interest of the unfed and unclad 15,000 bank depositors . " " Can yqu ' say that this $500,000 may be distributed unconditionally ? " Mr. Mayer was asked . The Chicago lawyer shook his head and explained that it was available on the condition that Siegel and Vogel should be allowed " to find the security for the balance of their indebtedness . " The District Attorney again - pointed out yesterday that it was - not in his province to stop the indictments pending against Siegel and Vogel or to ask for a suspended sentence in the case of conviction in consideration of any payment that they might make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were-at liberty now and had been at liberty for weeks with plenty of opportunity to make restitution to the depositors . By doing so . he said , they might impress the - court so favorably that the court would be disposed toward clemency . He was asked if Mr. Stanchfield had told him that Siegel and Vogel intended to plead guilty to the indictments.Mr . Whitman referred his questioners to Mr. Stanchfield . He also was asked if the amount that the friends and relatives of Siegel and Vogel had raised for the depositors had been increased , and he said it had not . At the offices of Stanchfield &; Levy Mr. Stanchfield was unwilling to discuss his visit to the office of the District : Attorney . Likewise Mr. Levy would have nothing to say about it . Cornelius W. Wickersham , counsel representing the United States Fidelity and Guaranty Company , which put up a bond of . $100,000 for Siegel and Vogel when they formed their banking co-. // MONEY TO PAY DEBTS IF SIEGEL GOES FREE // partnership , yesterday made application for an order of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Term . The order was signed , and to-morrow the bonding company will pay the face of the bond to the City Chamberlain . The bonding company will discharge its liability by canceling the bond , and Henry Melville , receiver of Henry Siegel &; Co. , bankers , will be substituted for . the bonding company as defendant in the action brought by the Attorney General to recover on the bond for the depositors . On making his application for the order Mr. Wickersham said : " We do this first , because we are anxious that the depositors may get some sort of a dividend as soon as possible , and show our good faith . We have no defense ( to the collection of this bond ) and our only reason for failure to pay this bond before is that another action was pending . " Mr. Wickersham asked for an order specifying that the money should be turned over to the City Chamberlain within five days , this lapse of time having been thought necessary because the check must come from the home office of the bonding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be turned over to the custodian of the county and city funds . Deputy Attorney General William A. eleQuaid , when seen by Joseph M.
