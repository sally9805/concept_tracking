txt Police Commissioner Cropsey , whose resignation was expected yesterday after publicity was given to the letter from James Creelman , President of the Municipal Civil Service Commission , to Mayor Gas-nor , charging that Mr. Cropsey had violated the civil service law , was still Commissioner last night . No statement , official or otherwise , that his resignation bad been accepted or offered , was forthcoming , although the general impression in the Police Department was that Commissioner Cropsey had made up his mind to quit , and that his resignation would be announced either by himself or Mayor Gaynor to-day . The Commissioner was closeted with Mayor Gaynor more than an hour late yesterday afternoon , having been summoned to City Hall in connection with the charges preferred by Mr. Creelman , published In yesterday 's TrMxs . Both the Commissioner and the Mayor refused to discuss the conference . " I know of nothing new in the police situation . and do not know that there will be anything , " said Mayor Gaynor . " Not a word , " said - the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office . Neither the Mayor nor Mr. Cropsey appeared at all excited after their long conference . Pi fact , several of the prophets around City Hall were of the opinion that Mr. Cropsey is not at all averse to quitting the Police Department . as his official life there has been far from pleasant , owing to the frequent criticism directed at him . No Choice of a Successor . No inkling of whom the Mayor will choose as Mr. Cropsey 's successor if he resigns to-day could be obtained from Mayor Gaynor or from any of the likely men themselves . William J. Flynn , who resigned recently as Second Deputy ; Chief Magistrate William , . Fire Commissioner Waldo , and ex-Chief of Police John McCullagh are all mentioned . Mr. Flynn . who is slated to return to the ' United States Secret Service on Monday next , was asked yesterday if he had received any communication from Mayor Gaynor regarding the Commissionership . Mr. Flynn said that he had not , and intimated : hat he was not expecting one . Neither Chief Magistrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? mikiz.:et , if is gen- ' erally belirved that either would accept the place . They have had experience in the Police Department , Chief Magistrate 2 . P , Commissioner and Mr. Waldo as a : Deputy Commissioner . - First Deputy Commissioner Driscoll is also slated to leave the department soon , according to reports yesterday . It is said that Mr. Flynn would not accent the Commissionership if Mr. Driscoll was retailed as First Deputy , for it Is supposed to have been largely because of friction between the two that Flynn left the department and applied for his old place in the Secret Service . The First Deputy was in his office at Police Headquarters only a few minutes yesterday morning . He and Commissioner Cropsey hastened over to Staten Island in the morning to appear before the Grand Jury at Richmond , the county seat . It was reported that the jurymen wished to know why the Richmond County Court House was not properly policed during the Magnotti trial last week . The District Attorney of Richmond Ccunty applied for extra police protection because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present a number of Italians who looked to the county officials as though they might give serous trouble . It was also reported that the Grand Jury wished - to know why the policemen of Richmond have posts so long that they can not corer them in a tour of duty , what police protection is to be given at the beach resorts this Summer . and what steps have been taken to curb the rowdy tend- ! encies of Sunday visitors to the island resorts and basehall On the subject of the Grand Jury investigation Cornmissioner Cropsey had his usual reply of " Not a word . " Mayor Rebukes Grand Jury . Mayor Gaynor had a few things to say yesterday about the Grand Jury 's report on vice and crime and police . " It would be ungracious for me to find fault with their report , since it is favorsaid the Mayor . " They have helped to dispose of the vile slanders against this city , that it is a place given over to vice and crime . Nevertheless , I desire to say that no Grand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the police authorities or any other public Officials . or to assume to advise them in any way , or to criticise or condemn them except by indictment . To do so would be mere impertinence , even though advised by a Judge . " The business of a Grand Jury is to inquire into the commission of crimes and to indict where they find crimes were committed . I would not think of meddling in the business of a Grand Jury . nor would I suffer any Grand Jury to meddle with me by way of advice . I say this with no ill-will . Judge Mulqueen charged all of this to a Grand Jury a few days ago . He was entirely correct . " The Grand Jury 's report has not been sent to me . If it should be I shall send it hack with a letter that the Grand Jury has no right to meddle with public officials by way of advice , as I did a year ago in the case of presentments of Grand Juries of Queens and Kings Counties . " Those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between Mayor Gaynor and Commissioner Cropsey said yesterday that the breach between the two officials had been widening for several weeks . They said that at the police parade Mayor Gaynor barely spoke to his Police Commissioner during the time they stood upon the reviewing platform . On the morning of the police parade Commissioner Cropsey sent his own automobile to Mayor Gaynor 's house and placed it at the Mayor 's disposal . Mayor Gaynor ignored the offer . One of the Police Commissioner 's first acts , which is said to have displeased the Mayor , was the dismissal of Lieut . Foody Deputy Driscoll had found Lieut . Foody drinking a glass of beer in the Hiebbridge district . He brought charges which wore sustained by the Commissioner . The Lieutenant was the sole support of a large family . This was called to Mayor Gaynor 's attention and he asked that the Police Commissioner he lenient . But Lieut . Foody was dismissed . The most serious complaint against Mr. Cropsev was contained in Mr. Creelman 's letter it ) the Mayor , accusing the Police Commissioner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his appointments of policemen .
