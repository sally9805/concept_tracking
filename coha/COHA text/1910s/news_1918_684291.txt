txt There was a feeling of optimism pervading the White House yesterday . It was due to the fact that all information reaching there tends to indicate that there will be speedy readjustment of business from war to peace conditions . It is pointed out that the United States has paid as it went along in this war ; that general business , while interrupted by the war program , was rot suspended in any particular important branch ; and that , therefore , business could be the more readily resumed in nil important channels . The President seems to exude optimism . He is now engaged in collecting data to guide hint on a plan of business reconstruction , At present it takes the form of a commission to be an official commission in its personnel . Its members are to be war and navy officials and memLers of the Senate and Howe committees on appropriation . This plan is tentatively ugly . and may he changed as the question is more closely and thoroughly studied .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
