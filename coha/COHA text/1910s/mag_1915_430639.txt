 | IT is now thirteen years since there appeared in these pages a bit of social speculation entitled " The Next Step : a Benevolent Feudalism . " It was an article which sought to describe certain tendencies asserted to be then at work : the steady growth of a state within a state ? the collective power of the magnates of industry ; the increasing dependence and subordination of the other classes , and the failure of democracy , even tho it maintained and even extended its forms , to establish any effective control over the power of the combinations . Passing from prognosis to prediction , the suggestion was put forth of the development of a social system in many respects analogous to that of overlord and underling in the England of the fourteenth century . Yet , tho the essay is well-nigh forgotten , in many minds the more or less vague sense . of a coming feudalism persists . The general reaction which now shows itself in the expressions of the press , the pulpit and the forum , and which registered itself in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigation of the great Foundations and the revelation of the potency , both for evil and good , that lies behind them ; the merciless suppression of labor troubles in West Virginia , Michigan , Colorado and New Jersey ; the grant of increased freight rates to the railroads ; certain decisions of the Supreme Court and certain recent pronouncements of the President ? all these have contributed to bringing again into the common thought the idea of a feudal regime . It may , therefore , at this time , be interesting , and perhaps profitable , to look over the field and to note what tendencies described a dozen years ago have continued and what ' results have followed . The intervening period has been big with events . THE CONCENTRATION OF INDUSTRY First , there is the matter of increasing concentration . Occasionally , it is true , some eager person inspired with the holy mission of destroying the heresies of the Socialists , appears with a set of more or less ingenious figures intended to show the breakup of the combinations and the diffusion of ownership . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even the least informed . The increasing concentration of industry is sensed by every one . It is , moreover , demonstrated by data that can not be disregarded . In 1904 Mr. John Moody was able to find only about $20,000,000 , - 000 of corporate capitalization . Returns to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue for the year ended June 30 , 1913 , show that the corporations then had a capital stock of nearly $62,000,000,000 , with bonded and other indebtedness of nearly $35,000 , - 000,000 . As the total wealth of the nation , very much of which is quite incapable of capitalization , was then but $135,000,000,000 , the degree of combination may be seen at a glance . In the field of manufactures the most recent census ( 1909 ) shows that 79 per cent of the nation 's product came from corporations . And if this dominance of the corporate form of industry is not of itself a convincing proof of concentration , other figures in the same census , based on the size of establishments , prove it beyond question . The establishments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11.5 per cent of the total number , but they produced 82.2 per cent of the total product . It needs hardly to be said that increasing concentration is something else than a fiction concocted by wicked agitators . THE CONCENTRATION OF WEALTH Still , as has been frequently pointed out , the massing of industry is not necessarily a proof of the concentration of wealth . Medium and small , as well as large capitals , are joined in most of the big concerns . Primarily , it is control , rather than wealth , that is centralized . But here again are authoritative data which reveal a concentration in wealth and income quite as pronounced as the concentration in control . They are the figures of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue for the calendar year ended December 31 , 1913 . We have heard much , from time to time , concerning the marvelous diffusion of wealth in the United States . Yet it appears " that out of 100,000,000 inhabitants only 357,598 , or less than four-tenths of one per cent , come under the provisions of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected to show a large number of incomes in the class ranging from $2500 to $5000 . Yet there are apparently only 193,910 of these incomes in the whole country . That the smaller units in trade and industry persist to a considerable extent is also true . Probably no one will venture to say , however , that their position is stronger today than it was thirteen years ago . As a matter of fact , it is very much weaker . In so-called prosperous times their number increases ; in deprest times it decreases . Such units as can be utilized by the larger concerns are by one means or another taken over ; such as are in any sense dangerous are usually chloroformed , while great numbers which are without potentiality , from the magnate standpoint , for either use or harm , are allowed a precarious continuance . All the time , however , the pressure of the big concerns becomes more constant , and the scope of the smaller units is restricted within narrower fields . They live , for the most part , only by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the magnate class has grown , so also has its political power . In most respects the political state is weaker today in the face of corporate power than it was a dozen years ago . The extension of democratic forms , such as the initiative , the referendum , the recall and woman suffrage , has had no appreciable effect , except in minor and isolated instances , upon this economic oligarchy . The prosecutions of certain great corporations have resulted only in revealing the impotence of organized society in the face of this great problem . In particular states , such as , West Virginia , Colorado and Michigan , it has been shown that the corporations pay no attention whatever to laws that it would be inconvenient for them to obey ; while thruout the land it has been shown ? what was apparent of old to Anacharsis ? that laws are but cobwebs for catching the little fellows . Law is for the trust victim , but not for the trust . This impotence of the political state in the face of the big economic powers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now apparently become evident to the national adminis- tration . The firm determination , often exprest , to " curb the power of the trusts , " has given way to an acknowledgment that nothing more is to be done . The latest official pronouncement declares that the depression felt by everyone is merely psychological ; that the people are really prosperous ; that the stories of unemployment and destitution have been greatly exaggerated , that the campaign of " curbing " is finished , and that the magnates may now go ahead and pile their profits as high as the Rockies . Not with a microscope can one discover that anything whatever has been done by the national Government which in the slightest particular curtails the power of the magnate or relieves the distress of the multitude . Nevertheless , the protest of the magnate and his retainers against " interference with business " has borne fruit , and the melodrama is ended . The state governments also have largely withdrawn from their onetime " interference with business . " A summary , just published , of legislative conditions in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only five of these states have passed or are considering legislation " inimical to business interests . " Sixteen states have enacted or are considering more or less " progressive " laws , in the main satisfactory to the corporate powers , while twelve states have merely marked time by clarifying existing laws . In spite of a certain amount of fruitless clamor , which like poverty we have always with us , the growing disposition is manifest on all sides to acquiesce in the rule of big business . SHRINKING WAGES How has it been with the farmers and wage-earners ? Farm tenantry has increased , so has mortgage indebtedness , and so also , in the predominantly agricultural sections , has the size of farm holdings . Child labor has increased slightly , and woman labor enormously . No torturing of figures serves to obscure the fact that actual wages for the great mass of the workers are considerably lower today than they were in 1902 . Thirteen years ago the steel workers received an average of $717 . In 1912 they received $857 . This higher sum , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier date , according to Bradstreet 's index figures , measures only $643 . The Interstate Commerce Commission 's tables of the pay of railwaymen , when equated on the same basis , show that no class except brakemen now receive as much actual wages as they received in 1902 , and that switch tenders and watchmen receive even less nominal wages now than they then received . Professor Scott Nearing 's careful computations indicate that threequarters of the adult males and nineteen-twentieths of the adult females employed in the industries located east of the Rockies and north of Mason and Dixon 's line receive less than $600 a year , whereas an income of less than $800 a year is declared by social workers not to permit of a decent standard of living . With this general reduction in the actual wages of the employed is to be coupled the fact that unemployment has been greater during the last two years than at any time since 1873 , and that last winter was characterized by an almost unexampled distress . During the period treated the unions of the American Federation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other unions , not affiliated with the Federation , have also increased their numbers . Organized labor has not , however , been able , except in rare instances , to advance wages in proportion to the increased cost of living . Nor has it been able seriously to hamper the movement for the socalled " open shop " ? in reality the shop closed to union men ? which has progressed thruout the nation . It is common testimony that the blacklist has been extended and more systematically employed . It is also common testimony that espionage in the unions has become closer and more general . There is a meaningless clause in the Clayton bill which has been hailed as a gain for organized labor ; but there is small doubt among observing men as to what will happen to this clause should it reach the Supreme Court . That mighty tribunal , by its affirmation of the judgment against the Danbury hatters and its nullification of the Kansas law prohibiting the discharge of a workman for being a member of a union , has impressively shown organized labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VASSAL No doubt , the employing class has considerably increased its " welfare work " among wage-earners ; new pension systems have been instituted and older ones extended , and the sharing of profits has become more general . In some establishments this benevolence has even taken the form of considerable increases in wages . This benevolence , however , is too incidental to have rendered any appreciable effect upon the condition of the wage-earning class as a whole . It is , moreover , a benevolence which aims at the complete divorce of the worker from his organization and his entire subordination to the establishment that employs him . The endowed worker must hold a prime fealty to his employer ; he must accept and welcome an espionage which notes his most intimate habits and conduct and a paternal guidance which in turn admonishes and approves . As an independent economic unit he ceases to exist . His bondage to the job is absolute . THE EFFORT TO BE FREE The history of modern democracy is the record of a more or less sustained struggle to extend and improve the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactions of a dominant economic class . Any step in the assertion of democratic control is usually followed by the popular conviction that now at last something effective has been done . As yet nothing is quite so easy as to delude ourselves with a belief in the supremacy of democracy . One has only to look about him here in America to note the innumerable evidences of democratic activity and achievement , political , economic and cultural . There is the spread of the initiative , the referendum , the recall and woman suffrage ; the change to the popular election of senators , the growth of the civic center movement , the revival of town meetings , the throwing open of school buildings to public gatherings , the extension of night schools and university instruction , the passage of workmen 's compensation and minimum wage laws , the doubling of the membership of the unions and the quadrupling of the vote of the Socialist party . Most of this has happened within a baker 's dozen of years . It is a record that impresses the average mind with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implacable foes are hurrying from the field in inglorious defeat . Yet all this activity and achievement have failed to loosen the grip of the magnate class upon the means of life or to lessen its control of the powers of government . Poverty is more widespread , and the individual economically is ever less free . Much of this activity has served merely to intensify popular delusion , and much of this achievement has made no more than a surface readjustment . Workmen 's compensation , for instance , gives greatly increased sums to injured workmen . It has taken this increase , however , not from the masters , who are paying no more than they were before , but from a class of parasite lawyers to whom formerly it went . In spite of the list of accomplished reforms which any one can  | chronicle , and which an apologist for the existing regime can stretch out interminably , an increasing share of the wealth produced goes to the master class , and no device so far employed affects this process . RULING BY DIPLOMACY It is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to secure to itself the master 's share of production . To every turn of political and economic development it must adjust itself . There were times when such a class maintained itself chiefly by force . The extension of democracy , that cheap and simple method of " counting heads instead of breaking them , " necessitates a lessening dependence upon force and an increasing dependence upon cajolery and adroitness . Yet let no one think that force will be neglected when and where it is thought necessary : for every Homestead or Coeur d'Alene or Hazelton of the earlier period , there is a recent Paint Creek , or Calumet , or Ludlow , or Roosevelt , New Jersey . But force , if not a last resort of the ruling powers , becomes at least a reluctant alternative , since its untactful use might awaken too heady an opposition . Rather , the ruling class must practise , by itself and thru its retainers , the politic arts which persuade a people that its best interests lie in resigned submission to the existing regime . The small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps never excelled for finesse , ruled a people without force and almost without opposition . It kept from the common mass of its own race every social and economic good , and yet made them its willing servitors . The instinctive resentment against slavery on the part of those whom the system impoverished was deftly turned by the master class into a resentment against the negro and the abolitionist . Tho the form differs , our magnate class of today maintains an equal domination . The Southern oligarchs were themselves the governors , senators , representatives and judges of their time . They suffered no middlemen , but bore sway in their own persons . Our present masters rule thru intermediaries . It is not the head of the trust , but one of its counsel , who holds political office . The mode is one happily suited to the higher development of democracy ; it aids in maintaining the illusion of popular control and makes for a quiescent electorate . Thru all the various agencies of popular control ? the press , the pulpit , the courts , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boards of trade and even the so-called citizens ' associations ? the magnate class and its employed retainers play constantly , as upon the strings of some responsive instrument , upon the caprice , the prejudice and the ignorance of the common mass . Every possible device for insuring content , or at least submission , is tested out to the full . To fit the varying moods of the populace , new devices must be constantly sought and old ones retried . The " social myth , " that alluring good which can be visualized thru the medium of some appealing word or phrase , is continuously employed to keep the mass quiescent . Such terms as " patriotism , " " progress , " " free competition , " " individualism , " " democracy , " " success " and " efficiency " have all served , or are serving , their turn . The last two , in particular , have played , within recent years , an effective part . " SUCCESS " AND " EFFICIENCY " A dozen years ago " success " had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an army and its devotees as the sands of the sea . As a spur to the flagging , as an allayer of disquiet , the idea which the word enshrined operated like the wand of a magician . To the most exploited worker it promised high place and rich rewards . All it asked was industry and perseverance and an unquestioning acquiescence in things as they are . Even the business failure of the literary high priest of the cult hardly diminished the ardor of its devotees . And yet , after a while , its magic declined . Gradually there dawned upon starved seamstress and weary loomtender the realization that no amount of endeavor brought them one whit nearer the goal of wealth and position . The spell was broken . Now we have " efficiency . " It promises both more and less than " success . " To the average man , not overillusioned with a sense of his own capacities , it promises , instead of elevation to an unattainable place , the immediate good of a greater product and a greater share . To the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in himself , it promises more things than Satan , on the Judean mount , offered the Savior . Thus , both as an economic quickener and as a social narcotic , it is far better adapted than was " success " to the varied temperaments and capacities of men . Yet , after a time , it must fail in its powers of illusion , and some new myth must be concocted to replace it . In every society , however , there will always be those who , skeptical and insurgent , decline to be influenced from above . But against these there can always be employed the device of division . In the trade unions , in the independent bodies of labor , in the farmers ' societies , in the Socialist party , the scout and the provoking agent , instructed and recompensed , carry on their work with increasing energy and more disciplined method . New movements , too , which threaten the unity of existing bodies of insurgents , are always , within certain limits , encouraged . Anarchism of itself is rather too old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Syndicalism , on the other hand , especially in its earlier phase , offered something worth while . Tho it was and is a hybrid kind of anarchism , its anarchistic features were not too obvious ; and it received , in its first stages , a large share of seigniorial patronage . Of course when in any particular place it became a pressing social nuisance , as in the " free speech fights " of the I. W. W. , it was forthwith supprest . It was tolerated and fostered only to the extent that it showed itself inimical to the integrity of the trade unions or of the Socialist party ; and when it failed in this threat , was speedily ignored from above . Now that it has spent itself , some new diversion must needs be created . THE COMPLACENT PUBLIC Thus there is no tendency mentioned in that article of thirteen years ago which has not since then developed and intensified . True , the attributing of any degree of general benevolence to the emerging order may seem , at this time , faulty in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the prediction made was of a benevolence nicely adjusted to the popular demand . A people satisfied with mere husks and leavings from the baronial tables would create upon the ruling class no pressure which would result in the scattering of largess . It was not then thought that a multitude of hungry men , with hungry wives and children , could be quieted by being told that their trouble was merely psychological , or that a pretentious program of " regulation " resulting in nothing but oracular utterances from the chief magistrate would be taken by a great people as the substance of a new freedom . If , then , the degree of benevolence predicted has not been attained , the cause is a popular complacence and love of illusion quite unthinkable a dozen years ago . And if the development of the tendencies then described indicated a regime of overlord and underling , that indication is a hundred times stronger in 1915 than it was in 1902.
