SCENE I : Atalanta , the novice , sits , rebellious and sullen , on the steps of the Mother Superior 's das . From time to time nuns and novices pass across the stage to the left , on their way to the refetory . Sister Grimana , an old nun , comes down to Atalanta purposefully . GRIMANA Sulking again , are you ? Waiting for Sister Benvenuta , are you ? Atalanta is silent . Remembering things that are really no concern of yours ; and thinking they concern you because you remember them  --  doubtless quite inaccurately . I know . It 's a way of the Badoer family  --  and of the Loredani , too , for that matter . When you were a child there was confiture with the bread  --  and you threw away the crust ; and they let you do it , and now you ca n't find your vocation . She taps her foot impatiently . Well  --  well  --  will you come ? Atalanta is still silent , her face hard with resolution . I might mention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Atalanta gives her a look of scornful disgust . It 's as well you did n't say that in so many words , Sister . Atalanta looks straight before her , a statue of silence . Perhaps there is some one you would prefer to have me call , before the Sister Sacristan comes to fetch you ? Sister Rosalba ? No response . So it must be Sister Benvenuta , must it ? p. 3 ATALANTA I would speak with her . GRIMANA Oho ! You would speak with her ! And so you shall  --  for the love I bore your mother when we were children together . But what good she can do you , with her chatter and laughing  --  childish laughing and chatter  --  I ca n't see . I 'll send her to you . And meantime , count your buttons . That 's my advice . Count your buttons . She comes close and speaks more confidentially . That helps greatly  --  it did when I was your age . Grimana goes off . Atalanta mechanically runs her fingers over the buttons of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the row , she mutters . ATALANTA Even you , Benvenuta ! At the second word the rises abruptly , her hands on the veil . Heaven forgive me ! She tears off the veil just as Benvenuta enters from the left . Benvenuta limps down around the Mother Superior 's throne , and on seeing Atalanta with her veil off , bursts into laughter . ATALANTA Even you , Benvenuta ! What amuses you so ? BENVENUTA It 's your hair . It 's so funny  --  it 's so long since I 've seen your hair , Atalanta , dear . ATALANTA sullenly .. It 's not that I want to talk to you about . You need n't have laughed . p. 4 BENVENUTA I know , dear . I should n't have laughed , but I always do . I 'm so unworthy . I ca n't seem to help it , though I tell myself , often and often , that it 's trifling and worldly to laugh so much , and undignified , too , before the children and novices . I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you wanted me . What is it , dear ? She looks at Atalanta and smothers another laugh . Put on your veil , child . ATALANTA Do n't call me child  --  I 'm only three years younger than you , and I 'm taller . She puts on the veil again , still sullen . BENVENUTA You 're only a novice and I call you a child  --  very properly , too . And if you want me to talk to you , you must listen  --  like a good child . A step is heard approaching and a rattle of keys ; Atalanta pulls at Benvenuta 's dress as if to draw her down beside her . ATALANTA It 's the Sister Sacristan . Now she 'll make me go , and there 's something you must tell me  --  you must  --  I beg of you . The Sister Sacristan comes in and goes straight to Atalanta , ignoring Benvenuta . Her keys are audible as the walks . SISTER SACRISTAN Well , Mistress Perverse and Disobedient ? Not come to reason yet ? p. 5 BENVENUTA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me speak with her a little while  --  only a little while . Her tasks can wait  --  SISTER SACRISTAN Her tasks ! Praise the Blessed Mother , in this noble house we need not depend on the novices for anything . It 's not that  --  it 's the discipline in the pigeon cot . The Mother Abbess will be displeased  --  BENVENUTA Pray you , Sister Sacristan . This novice has asked of me some spiritual admonition . She is my kinswoman , and I can not refuse it . So I ask you for a little time with her , to speak to her of spiritual things , and perhaps bring her some comfort , to the end that her holy vocation may the sooner come . I ask it in humility , Sister Sascristan . SISTER SACRISTAN crossing to the closet , which she unlocks.Admonition , eh ? She takes out some vestments , which she hangs over her arm , closing the door . BENVENUTA ask you to remember , Sister , that last Thursday I took upon myself the vexed matter of the hair of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my charge . SISTER SACRISTAN Yes  --  throve . You so coddled them that they cried for you each night after , and are more trouble to the lay sisters than ever . But since she 's your kinswoman  --  have it as you will . I look for little effect from your admonitions , I may as well tell you . She removes her keys and goes out , without locking the closet. p. 6 ATALANTA That was good of you , Benvenuta . Now , listen to me . I am unworthy . I am unhappy . I feel no call . Tell me  --  tell me about the world , Sister Benvenuta  --  I beg you , tell me  --  BENVENUTA I will tell you of God 's love , and of this holy life  --  ATALANTA leading her to the stairway , where the sits down.Yes  --  I know . But first , tell me about the world . BENVENUTA I only tell you by way of admonition  --  that you may see how hollow is the world , and full of delusion  --  ATALANTA I understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . BENVENUTA You must know then , that I  --  even I , Sister Benvenuta , was a most worldly little girl . I can remember so clearly how I used to run madly through the gardens , and roll on the grass like  --  like a wild puppy , and bury my face in the roses  --  till they scratched my nose and the warm scent made me dizzy . And then I would climb on the wall and watch the barges go by , with the strong men sculling them , and the women under the awnings sorting crabs and prawns . ATALANTA Tell me about the barge people . p. 7 BENVENUTA That was all I saw of them . And then they would take me to my lady mother , of a forenoon , while she was having her hair powdered and curled ; and there would be a black page bringing her chocolate , and her serving cavalier would be leaning beside her mirror taking snuff . ATALANTA Yes  --  tell me about the cavalier servant . BENVENUTA That was all I ever saw of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure . ATALANTA I wish you had seen more of him . And your mother ? Did she have little children ? BENVENUTA You know well I was the youngest of our family . That was why I was destined for the benefice we possessed In this high born convent . ATALANTA Tell me about your father ? BENVENUTA I used only to see him once in a month , and I was much frightened of him  --  he was so noble and so just . ATALANTA Oh , he was a father of that sort , was he ? BENVENUTA And when he did receive me , he had a handkerchief like a turban around his head , and horn spectacles on his nose , and he would be making gold with an astrologer , or putting devils in retorts . That was what he said he was doing , but I know now that he deceived me ; he was a very worldly man , though he was so noble and just . p. 8 ATALANTA Tell me , Benvenuta , when you were in the world , did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not old at all ? BENVENUTA The only one was in the picture in our chapel  --  the panel in the center with the Blessed Mother and the little Child Christ . He was so sweet , and his eyes were as if they would open in a moment and then I should know what color of eyes they were . ATALANTA glancing toward the Sacristy closet.And that 's why you so love the Bambino they keep in the Sacristy closet ? BENVENUTA Yes . ATALANTA more passionately.And was it easy for you , Benvenuta  --  always easy in your heart , to give up the world ? BENVENUTA I was destined for this , dear . ATALANTA rising.I am not sure . I was not destined . I am  --  BENVENUTA Ssh ! Dear Atalanta . Be quiet . Be calm . Yes , I was worldly , and I gave it up willingly  --  ATALANTA Yes , it was easy for you , and so you think it should be for me . You never even saw a little baby with her mother . You were destined , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the best . I was unworthy , but I gave up the world willingly  --  ATALANTA bitterly.Willingly  --  you were lame , and  --  She stops , biting her lips . There is a pause . BENVENUTA Yes . I was a little lame . But I was a worldly little girl . ATALANTA Forgive me , dear sister . I meant no hurt . BENVENUTA You did not hurt me . Another pause . ATALANTA Dear Benvenuta , one thing I must tell you . I must . It happened just before I came here . Benvenuta looks at her soberly . BENVENUTA Are you sure it is to me you should tell it ? ATALANTA It is not a sin  --  not something I could confess , dear . It was this . Just as you looked over the wall at the barges , it was . In our gardens there was a time when the old gardener brought a vinedresser to help him . And the vinedresser 's wife came with his dinner and their baby . And I came on them eating under the ilex trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was clambering over her . She was no older than I am now  --  the vinedresser 's wife . And she fed the baby at her breast in the deep shade under the ilexes . And I talked to her . Then the old gardener came , and of course I walked away , very haughtily , as became a daughter of the house . But hear me , sister . I can not forget her , the vinedresser 's wife with the baby clambering over her , under the shade of the ilex trees . I can not put her out of my thoughts . p. 10 BENVENUTA I understand you , dear . I can not put out of my thoughts the poor little Bambino in the Sacristy closet all the year around , shut up with the saint 's bones and the spare vestments , and he with only a piece of stiff purple and gold stuff around his middle . ATALANTA I can not think that the same . The vinedresser 's baby was alive  --  so alive . BENVENUTA It is much the same , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , Benvenuta . Why can I not forget about it ? BENVENUTA laying her hand on Atalanta 's head.It would be better if you could forget if , Atalanta . You must go now . ATALANTA One moment  --  do n't take your hand away . I had to tell somebody . Both look off in a sort of dreamy ecstasy , thinking of the two babies . Grimana enters again . Atalanta rises . ATALANTA I am full of thankfulness , Sister Benvenuta . I will go to my task . Atalanta bows her head and follows Grimana out . A muffled droning chorus is heard from the chapel . Benvenuta watches the others go off , and then speaks to the Bambino through the door of the Sacristy closet. p. 11 BENVENUTA My dear  --  my dear little Great One , can you hear my voice through the door ? Dear little child Christ , I am so sorry for you , alone for days and days In the closet with the holy relics and the wax lights . And at night it must be very cold for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little Great One , with my hands . She tries the door and , finding it unfastened , draws back from it a moment . It is open ; the Sister Sacristan has left it unlocked . For this I am thankful , for I am sure you put it into her mind to leave it so  --  or that you by your divine power and foresight put it out of her mind to lock it as she intended . She opens the door and looks in . If only I could get appointed Sacristan ! But I am too young and being lame would prevent my getting on to the step-ladders , as a Sacristan must . But I would never leave you alone among the relics in their cotton-wool , little Great One . And now  --  just for a moment lest the Sister Sacristan come back  --  I will take you out of the closet . She brings out the Bambino . I will show you the chapter room , for while you have seen all places , and the high heavens and all the hells , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after so long in the closet . See , yonder is the seat of the Mother Abbess . She is very great , and very holy , and of the high house of the Morosini . And that way is to the refectory and the work room . And that way is to the chapel  --  up the stairs . And up that way are our cells , where I sleep and where I pray to dream of you , little Great One . Touch my cheek , I pray you . How cold your hands are ! Touch my cheek as she said the vinedresser 's babe touched his mother 's  --  She stops suddenly , and then reverently returns the Bambino to his place . She kneels before the open door . Forgive me , dear little Child Christ . I spoke not in vain glory . But all my life I have waited , not knowing for what but happy dreaming that sometime If it be a sin I will confess it  --  I will . Again the rattle of keys is heard . Benvenuta stands up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming back to lock the closet . But I will get you a coat for the cold nights . Your hands were so cold . I will get you a warm coat  --  that I promise , dear little Great One . She closes the door and stands before it looking consciously innocent , at the Sister Sacristan enters . The Sister Sacrisian is not deceived , however. p. 12 SISTER SACRISTAN By your leave , Sister Benvenuta . She ostentatiously locks the closed door . BENVENUTA Sister Sacristan , I trust the novice you left in my charge has returned to her task . SISTER SACRISTAN I trust she has . BENVENUTA after a pause.I wish I might help you with your duties sometimes , Sister . SISTER SACRISTAN I do not need you , little sister . BENVENUTA I am sorry . Mechanically she counts her buttons . Enter the Abbess . ABBESS to the Sacristan.Sister , go into the chapel and tell the Reverend Father that the Bolognese puppet man is waiting , and say that I wish to see him here ; and bid the Reverend Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Sister Sacristan goes out . Benvenuta remains , waiting patiently for a word from the Abbess . Well , my little sister ? BENVENUTA I pray you , Mother . ABBESS I listen , little sister . BENVENUTA It is about the little Child Christ . I pray you that a coat may be made for him  --  a warm coat of soft silk ; for at Christmas he lies out in the draughty manger before the altar , and even at other times He is very cold at night here in the Sacristy closet . And I pray you . Mother ? p. 13 ABBESS I listen . Renter the Sister Sacristan . BENVENUTA That I may help with the making of the coat , for all that I sew so badly . ABBESS smiling.Truly , our little sister Benvenuta Loredan was born to be the nursery-maid of Heaven . SISTER SACRISTAN Is is for me to know also , Mother ? ABBESS Our little sister wishes that a coat of warm silk be made for the little Bambino , against next Christmas in the cold of the chapel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ABBESS You do not approve , sister ? SISTER SACRISTAN No , mother . It would be taking the time and money from the redressing of the skeleton of Saint Prosdoscimus , which is a most creditable relic , of unquestioned authenticity , with real diamond loops in his eye holes ; this skeleton ought to be made fit to exhibit for veneration . And besides , this Bambino never had any clothes , and so far as I know never wanted any . The purple sash is only for modesty 's sake . And as for such a new-fangled proposal coming from Sister Benvenuta  --  that alone  --  ABBESS That will do . Fie , fie , little sister . The Sacred Bambino is not your serving Cavalier , that you should wish to cover him with silk and velvet . Is the Reverend Father coming ? p. 14 SISTER SACRISTAN Immediately , mother . He only stayed to gather his manuscript . ABBESS Call in the man with the puppets . Exit Sister Sacristan . And now , little sister , you may go . You see it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , mother . I see it is not wise . Benvenuta goes up the staircase and off at the left .  --  The Abbess seats herself in the chair of State . The Father Confessor comes in from the Chapel . ABBESS You are welcome , Father . ABBE FILOSI bowing very low.Happy greetings , Reverendissima . ABBESS I have sent for you because the puppet man , the Bolognese one you sent for , has come to make his bargain for the Shrove-tide play , and I wished you to be present , lest he fail to serve your inspiration worthily . ABBE FILOSI I am grateful for your care in the matter , Reverendissima . Enter Sister Sacristan . ABBESS The fellow is waiting ? The Sister Sacristan bows . Show him in . The Sister Sacristan goes out . And now , Father , I pray that you will make terms for your play , as you please . p. 15 ABBE FILOSI Perhaps I had better not do that , Reverendissima . Poets are proverbially improvident  --  ABBESS That does not matter in the least . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Sister Sacristan brings in the Puppet Man , who carries a bag of his puppets on his arm . He bows extravagantly to the Abbess . PUPPET MAN Excellenza Reverendissima , my prayers shall in the future be lightened by the memory of your presence . Reverend Father , I am humbly your servant . The Abbess nods to Father Filosi . ABBE FILOSI You have been summoned here , sir , with regard to the Shrove Tuesday play which her Excellenza condescends to give for the edification of the friends of this noble convent . She has commissioned me to write the poem , and she graciously proposes to allow you to perform it with your puppets . PUPPET MAN I am honored , and in me all my craft is honored . ABBE FILOSI I have here the manuscript of my poor device . PUPPET MAN I can not have so excellent a work so slightly spoken of . ABBE FILOSI A trifle a trifle . But I trust , when you have done your part , it may amuse the novices and the ladies  --  noble guests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is it from the gospels , or a saint 's story ? ABBE FILOSI Humbly , it is the story of Judith . PUPPET MAN Humbly , as an artist , I am filled with delight . And I have for it just the figures you could wish . A Judith , lovely beyond the power of song , and a Prince , heavy with gold , and a cavalier for the lady  --  ABBE FILOSI That will not serve . In my play she goes with only her maidservant to the tent of the Holophernes . PUPPET MAN It is not usual , in Venice . Will it not be deemed strange by the ladies present ? ABBE FILOSI Better so , than its author be deemed ignorant by the learned Reverendissima , who will grace your performance personally . PUPPET MAN stiffly.I bow to your learning , Reverend Father . ABBE FILOSI My poem will require of you some artistry , and not all of the stable and accustomed sort . The Puppet Man bows . I shall require , for example , that the head of the Holophernes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undertake it , and moreover , I will promise a goodly flow of red blood from the corpus of the Holophernes. p. 17 ABBE FILOSI Excellent . Further , there is required a Triumph of Judith , in a car of state , and a figure of Time , speaking , and a Religion , out of the clouds , who speaks some verse in praise of the Reverendissima and of the noble house of the Morosini . All this must be carried out precisely . PUPPET MAN All this I undertake , seeing how famous is this convent , and of how illustrious a house is its Abbessa . Suffer me to inquire if the entire poem is of a lofty and tragic nature . ABBE FILOSI Certainly . PUPPET MAN This is a great honor to me , but a ruinous one as well . For I see I shall have no opportunity to bring on my most potent figures  --  my Harlequino with the seven wires , and  --  ABBE FILOSI Harlequino does not appear in the poem . PUPPET MAN But might he not appear in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I might perform an interlude between the Harlequino and the serving-wench of Judith , after the death of the Holophernes ? ABBE FILOSI Dio , dio  --  what a profanation ! ABBESS Come , come , your Reverence , I see no profanation in it . We must not be too severe  --  too lofty . Think of our guests , and of the novices , mere children in heart  --  who will be witnessing our play . Let there be something in it for the liking of all , I should say . p. 18 ABBE FILOSI But , Reverendissima  --  PUPPET MAN I could assure you of the success of the poem , if you would permit it . ABBESS I am sure it will be permitted . And now , sir , there are some other matters to be settled . First , we shall require that you bring here your puppets , in advance of the play , for our inspection , lest there be anything ungodly and unfit about them . PUPPET MAN It is the custom . I have brought some ; and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father 's poem , and know which ones shall be required . Opens his bag and takes out puppets . Here is a lady who might serve for Judith . And here a Prince , though I have a richer one , better perhaps for the Holophernes . And here a devil  --  a Salanasso , and here  --  ABBESS Leave them all on the table . I will have them examined at leisure . Now , sir , tell me what you expect to be paid for this performance ? PUPPET MAN fingering his **25;1797;TOOLONG , considering the difficulties of the poem , and the Holophernes to be visibly beheaded , and the great fame of this convent , that is said to require of every novice sixteen quarterings to her crest and a thousand ducats of dowry , and considering the illustrious family of which the Abbessa herself descends  --  I will perform the poem in the best manner for twelve ducats. p. 19 ABBESS Considering just the matters you mention , and the honor to you to bring your puppets into this convent at all , you shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I can not have heard you aright  --  five ducats . ABBESS Five ducats . PUPPET MAN Mercy of the Saints ! Five ducats for Shrove Tuesday , and a Holophernes to be visibly beheaded  --  in a most illustrious convent , too . It is ruin to me , Reverendissima  --  black ruin . ABBESS Five ducats you shall have . PUPPET MAN starting to put his puppets back in the bag.It is not possible , Reverendissima . No one of my craft could do it  --  even the worst of them would ask more than I have . Mere jugglers and bunglers from Padua would ask twenty ducats . And the fame of this convent ! I see I have been deceived ,  --  ABBESS Be silent , sir . You can not trifle with me . Put down your trinkets . Do you know who I am , and of what family in the world ? Well , sir ? PUPPET MAN slowoly putting down his puppets again.Maybe it will profit me in the sight of the Saints  --  p. 20 ABBESS I need not warn you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style against Shrove Tuesday . And if all goes well , I may add a ducat to your fee . She taps a gong on the table , and the Sister Sacristan enters . The Puppet Man , dismissed , bows himself out , clutching the manuscript to his breast . The Sacristan follows him out , returning at once . Now , Father , since the play is yours , it shall also be yours to pass on the propriety of the figures . ABBE FILOSI I do not seek the responsibility , Reverendissima . Will you not excuse me ? ABBESS You have some intention in this , Father ? ABBE FILOSI Will you not excuse me ? ABBESS smiling.Certainly not . What troubles you about it ? ABBE FILOSI Reverendissima , I would gladly have passed it in silence . Your wisdom in matters of the world  --  and of the Church  --  is greater than mine . But look you now . This Judith I think shows more of her bosom than is seemly . ABBESS with asperity.I will instruct you . By the laws on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her bosom and no more , and there is no immodesty in the proceeding . This law the lady Judith obeys . p. 21 ABBE FILOSI I do not dissent from your wisdom , nor from the law of Venice . Still , it seems to me there would be more propriety in it if we were to have a collarette of tissue pinned about her  --  the eyes of all the novices , remember  --  ABBESS I remember also our guests , many of them ladies of the first houses , who would certainly take it amiss , and as a reflection upon themselves  --  ABBE FILOSI I wish with all my heart , Reverendissima , you had excused me . ABBESS turning to Sister Sacristan.I will ask the Sisters Grimana Emo and Rosalba Foscarini to examine the puppets . The Sister Sacristan goes out . Their learning in theology may not be profound , but they know the world 's judgment , coming as they do of the first families . The Abbe Filosi bows low . ABBE FILOSI I shall be at your service , Reverendissima . ABBESS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He bows himself out , at right , as Sister Grimana and Sister Rosalba enter left . GRIMANA You have sent for us , Mother ? ABBESS In the matter of the Shrove Tuesday play  --  yes . The puppets will be brought in advance , as usual . These few the show-man has already left . p. 22 GRIMANA You wish them to be looked over , as usual ? ABBESS Not quite as usual . This year they are to appear in a play or poem which the Father Confessor has written for us  --  dealing with the story of Judith . Now the good Abbe , though a man of great learning and a graceful poet withal , has not the advantage of family that some of our sisters  --  GRIMANA And some of our guests  --  ROSALBA I remember once , at a fte in the gardens of my uncle , the Doge  --  ABBESS I need instruct you no further . I do not wish anything ungodly or unfit to appear ; nor do I wish anything in the play to suggest that there is any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mother . It is chiefly a question of the dressing of the ladies . ABBESS Precisely . I shall leave it in your charge . Remembering , Sister Grimana , the laws of Venice and the customs of the house of your father , the most illustrious Admiral , and you Sister Rosalba , the ftes in the gardens of your uncle , the Doge  --  surely it will be properly eared for . Exit the Abbess . GRIMANA All this because we have been given a bourgeois Confessor  --  p. 23 ROSALBA No matter for that , Sister . I love puppets . We had once a puppet festival , when they played the whole history of the Serene Republic , and there were great ships with puppet sailors  --  They begin to separate the puppets with their wires and strings . Enter Sister Benvenuta . BENVENUTA Oh , the joy ! Are these for the Shrove Tuesday play ? If only we could show them to  --  She glances toward the Sacristy closet , stops , and goes on . Sister Rosalba , can you make them dance ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ROSALBA You might sing for them , Sister . GRIMANA Aye , so I might .  --  Time was when I knew tunes enough . BENVENUTA There is a lute in the cloister  --  left from the musical mass . And my cousin Atalanta can play it  --  I should like to hear some music here . She glances at the closet . I 'll fetch her . She goes off to find Atalanta . GRIMANA What personages have we here ? This lady for Judith ? ROSALBA That can scarcely be , Judith was black haired . p. 24 GRIMANA Nothing of the sort . She had hair of a dark red  --  a smoldering color . ROSALBA Was she not of the tribe ?  --  GRIMANA What matters the tribe ? In her picture by Titian , in the great hall of my father 's house  --  ROSALBA We had a Judith also  --  by Jacopo Bellini . He was Titian 's master . Her hair was black . GRIMANA You may be right . In our picture by Titian , now I remember it , the head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could see little of the hair . Rosalba is somewhat put down by the splendor of Grimana 's Titian . Benvenuta comes back with Atalanta , who carries a lute . As she appears Grimana untangles and holds up another puppet  --  the Beelzebubb . GRIMANA Here 's a personage of terror . She turns the figure and moves it threateningly toward Benvenuta , who looks at Beelizebubb and is instantly seized with a wild fit of laughter . Saint Mark preserve us ! You are queerly pleased , Sister . It 's not many that laugh at this figure . ROSALBA reading the figure 's label.He 's Beelzebubb Satanasso , Prince of all Devils. p. 25 BENVENUTA I pray your pardon . I could not keep from laughing . I can never look at a devil without laughing . He seems so anxious to understand , and so important with the responsibility of being Prince of all Devils . ROSALBA You may laugh if you like , but you should remember how ready he is to slip away with the unwary souls of people who laugh at him . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , for a wavering thought or a rift in one 's faith  --  GRIMANA See here the pouch he carries to put your soul in . Truly , Sister , he might pluck you off like a cherry . ATALANTA shuddering.Dear Sister Grimana  --  I beg of you  --  GRIMANA And he comes at the call of the secret thought  --  that 's what makes him look so anxious  --  lest he should not be listening when you call him , and the Saints come to your soul first , and warn it  --  ATALANTA Sister Grimana ! BENVENUTA Still , I can never look at him without laughing . He is droll . Atalanta , the lute . Atalanta brings forward the lute and tries the strings . Rosalba takes up the puppet of the lady . I saw the show-man . He was a most ill-favored man . Sister Rosalba , do you think he was excommunicate . p. 26 ROSALBA Of course not . And if he were , that would not make his puppets excommunicate . GRIMANA What if it did ? A noble convent has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What shall I play ? GRIMANA Can you play ? She sings : Go visto una colomba el cielo andareChe la svolava su per un giardino In mezzo ' I peto la gavea do aleE in boca la tegniva un zenzamino ! ATALANTA I do not know the air . But I can play a furlana . BENVENUTA That will be gay , Atalanta . Play a furlana , I beg you . GRIMANA That will serve , Sister Rosalba , your prince . As Atalanta plays , Grimana manipulates the Judith and Rosalba the Prince . They are unskillful and the puppets dance crudely , but Benvenuta looks on in ecstasy , falling slowly back until the stands by the door of the closet . As She does so two or three more nuns and novices come furtively in at the back and stand watching the performance . As the dance of the puppets grows more animated the Abbess enters with the Sister Sacristan . For a moment the others do not see her , and the play continues . Then she speaks coldly and evenly. p. 27 ABBESS Sisters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trinkets ? Sister Grimana ! Grimana lays down the puppets and comes forward . Sister Rosalba ! Rosalba also comes forward . I will consider this , and will give out the penances in chapter . GRIMANA Yes , Mother . Rosalba stands with her head bowed and her fingers run along the buttons of her cape . ABBESS There has been too much playing of lutes , too much worldly anticipation and imagining among us . So I have decided that all the holy relics shall be re-furbished , and all the vestments mended and cleaned , against Shrove Tuesday . And all other work , whether of embroidery or of whatever nature , shall wait till this be done . Sister Sacristan , let the tasks be set at once . The sisters bow their heads and go out , the Sister Sacristan following Rosalba and Grimana off . Benvenuta stands still in an attitude of deep humility . Well , little Sister ? BENVENUTA Holy Mother , I am waiting for my penance . ABBESS Your penance , Benvenuta ? BENVENUTA The fault was mine . I brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it all . I am heedless , and unworthy , and stained with worldliness , Mother . p. 28 ABBESS There , there , my child . I will overlook it . Benvenuta turns away , weeping furtively . Come here , little Sister . Why should you weep ? I have said I will overlook it . BENVENUTA I weep because I am unworthy to be penanced . I am nothing . ABBESS You are nothing ? Is not this the very essence of humility ? Little Sister , when I forgave you your fault , did you doubt my wisdom ? BENVENUTA Yes , holy Mother . Oh , I have sinned in vain glory . I doubted . But I did not mean to doubt . ABBESS smiling.Come hither , little Sister . If I must set you a penance , what would you have it be ? BENVENUTA I would have it no She hesitates . ABBESS Speak , Sister . BENVENUTA I would have you set me to the making of a coat for the Holy Bambino , as I asked of you before . ABBESS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you sew so badly . BENVENUTA Yes , Mother . I sew badly . And it would not really be a penance . The Sister Sacristan comes in and takes from the closet some cloth and a reliquary or two . She lays them on the table , preparing them for work. p. 29 ABBESS I will speak of this another time . Another time , little Sister . Benvenuta stands very still . The Abbess turns to the Sister Sacristan . What have you there ? SISTER SACRISTAN The fine lawn for the surplices for His Eminence . ABBESS That can wait . I do not think it wise to leave the workroom alone while the relics are being done over . She stands in the doorway . The Sister Sacristan is about to follow , but notices Benvenuta and goes over ostentatiously to lock the closet ; then she goes out after the Abbess . Benvenuta stands still and her eyes go from the closet to the cloth and takes up a piece of lawn , and carries it with her to the closet door . BENVENUTA Dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep my promise . I do not understand what the Holy Mother means . But I will do my penance when she determines it . I do sew very badly , dear little Great One , but I will make the stitches slowly , night by night in my cell , and every one of them , no matter how far askew , shall have all the love of my heart drawn tight in it . I have promised you a coat , little Great One , and I will surely keep my promise . She steals upstairs in the gathering darkness . The organ in the chapel is heard , faintly at first , then swelling in exullation . Slowly , after she disappears , the door of the closet opens of itself , and from within a golden light glows across the room and up the stair . The Curtain Falls. @x SCENE II . In her white-walled cell , with its one high window looking over the tree tops into the night sky , Benvenuta sits alone , sewing , with great labor and difficulty , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knock , and Atalanta slips in , bringing something concealed under her cape . BENVENUTA Have you brought it , dear ? ATALANTA I 've got the coat of the gardener 's child , but I fear it is not what you wanted . BENVENUTA I 'm sure it will serve . Why do you fear for it ? ATALANTA Because it 's the little girl 's coat . The boy 's I could not get , for he has but , the one , and the nights are so cold . BENVENUTA So they are  --  and we would n't have the poor lad shivering . Perhaps the girl 's will serve . Did you get the thread of gold ? ATALANTA Yes , dear . There is a pause . You would n't be happier telling me all about it ? Or letting me help you , perhaps ? BENVENUTA What good were there in that ? You sew as badly as I do , child . ATALANTA It 's not kind of you to say so . BENVENUTA I 'm sorry , Atalanta , dear . And it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me  --  helping me very much . And as for my telling you  --  it 's a great secret , and you should be content to know as much as you do of it . p. 31 ATALANTA I 'm afraid I know too much of it now . I 'm afraid I ought to be confessing what I know already . BENVENUTA Confessing it . Oh , no ; Atalanta , dear  --  ATALANTA I 'm afraid I ought  --  unless you tell me more . BENVENUTA Oh , I see . Now , listen , my child . This matter is one concerning my devotions  --  a private matter surely , and needing no confessions from you . ATALANTA Then why these secret messages , and the gold thread , and the gardener 's child 's coat to be got by stealth ? BENVENUTA For what I am doing , I would call for help from you  --  or from any one  --  from the Evil One himself , if it would serve . But it is surely no sin  --  though it might get you into trouble to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prt ! That 's not what I mind . BENVENUTA You  --  you love me enough to be troubled for my sake , a little , dear ? ATALANTA breaking out. I would flout the Mother Abbess to her face for you , Benvenuta . It 's that you try to keep me in the dark that I mind about it . I 'm going . Atalanta turns sharply and goes . Benventa lays out the little coat of the gardener 's child , and lays her lawn , already cut , upon it . She seems discouraged , turns it over , and tries again . Then with an air of resolution , she takes it up and sows fiercely , pricking her fingers , stopping to put them to her mouth , and going on doggedly. p. 32 BENVENUTA I promised it , dear little Great One , and I would give my soul to keep my promise , but I fear me it will never comfort you . She sews for a minute in silence . Then lifts her head with a sudden thought , and says aloud with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After a moment there is a light tapping of footsteps ; then a marked rapping , as of hoofs on a pavement ; she shivers , and starts up in sudden terror , as Beelzebubb Satanasso confronts her . He is like the Devil Puppet in every respect , but the size of a small man . He bows low in a mechanical sort of way as if jointed . She gazes at him in wonder , laughs nervously and suppresses her laughter . BEELZEBUBB SATANASSO in a voice like a Jews ' harp.Sister Benvenuta , did I hear you call for me , or wish for me to come ? BENVENUTA Yes , I called you . BEELZEBUBB SATANASSO You wished me to help you ? BENVENUTA Yes . BEELZEBUBB SATANASSO You know who I am . He points to his label . BENVENUTA I know . You are Beelzebubb Satanasso , Prince of all Devils . She suppresses a laugh. p. 33 BEELZEBUBB SATANASSO You have made a promise , and you can not keep it , so you call for help . I come , for I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is you want . BENVENUTA I have promised a coat to the little Child  --  BEELZEBUBB SATANASSO That will do . It were better not to speak the name . What sort of a coat do you wish ? BENVENUTA May I have just what I like ? BEELZEBUBB SATANASSO Certainly you may , my dear  --  if you are ready to pay for it . BENVENUTA I am ready . And I should like a little coat like the one on the second of the Magi in the Adoration by Bellini that is over the altar in our chapel at home  --  in the house of the Duke Loredano . BEELZEBUBB SATANASSO Let me understand exactly . The coat is to be like the coat on the second figure to the left from the center of the picture ? BENVENUTA Yes  --  no , there 's a Saint Joseph also at the back . He would be the third  --  from the Holy  --  BEELZEBUBB SATANASSO I pray you , keep the names of these people out of it . BENVENUTA These people ! Benvenuta 's hand moves as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And let your hand fall . You were about to make  --  to make some sort of sign with it . These practices are very distasteful to me . I can not help you  --  or even stay for an interview  --  if you persist in them . BENVENUTA I beg your forgiveness . I had no intention  --  BEELZEBUBB SATANASSO I believe that  --  it is merely a habit you have learned  --  but it is distasteful to me . BENVENUTA I will not offend you again . BEELZEBUBB SATANASSO Now to business . You wish of me a coat , a rich coat like that on the third figure from the center of the picture that is in your father 's chapel at Venice . And the size  --  BENVENUTA To fit the little Child  --  BEELZEBUBB SATANASSO interrupting sharply.I beg of you ! I understand . The coat is of what color ? BENVENUTA It is the coat of the second of the Magi  --  He puts up his hand , and she checks herself . It is of carmine silk damask with gold thread , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precisely like the picture , since you promise so much . p. 35 BEELZEBUBB SATANASSO It shall be so . I will undertake to bring you the coat . And in exchange I ask only that you sign your name here . He takes out a parchment contract , with a great red seal on it . I regret that ink will not do . You must prick one of your fingers . I am very sorry , but there is no other way . BENVENUTA Prick my finger ? Once ? BEELZEBUBB SATANASSO Only once , to secure the drop of blood . I am sorry to ask it , but  --  BENVENUTA As though it never happened to me before ! She pricks her finger and squeezes out a drop of Blood . He whips out a quill pen , and deftly wets it with the blood . BEELZEBUBB SATANASSO You will sign here . BENVENUTA And what does it say ? I should be loath to sign anything unworthy of my family , or of this noble convent  --  BEELZEBUBB SATANASSO There is nothing novel about it  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I assure you , by many of the highest families in Venice . It merely binds me at once to furnish you the rich coat , and you to give me your little flame of a soul  --  when I come for it . That is all . BENVENUTA Give me the pen . She sings the contract . He passes his hand thrice across the pouch and then takes from it the coat , and lays it across her lap . He steps back and bows stiffly , folding the contract and smiling. p. 36 BEELZEBUBB SATANASSO My dear young lady  --  my dear little sister . He bows again , and vanishes ; again the organ is heard , and Benvenuta is left , her face glowing in ecstasy , the carmine coat across her knees. @x SCENE III : The Chapter Room . Night . The Abbess giving orders to Grimana , Rosalba , the Sister Sacristan and others , about the midnight office . ABBESS All are to be present . None are to be indulged . I beg you , so inform the sisters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in their places . I know the hour is late for them , and many are young , but this is an exceptional night . Stay .  --  The novice Atalanta Badoer  --  I shall require her apart from the others . She will be needed with her lute . GRIMANA I will look to it , Reverend Mother . She sets about to gather her embroidery . ABBESS Now in the matter of the relics and vestments ? SISTER SACRISTAN The relics are all re-furbished and repacked in new cottonwool , Reverend Mother . ABBESS And the vestments ? SISTER SACRISTAN The vestments are all in order  --  She is about to mention something about the vestments , but stops herself . ABBESS Go on . SISTER SACRISTAN I must report , as a matter of duty , Reverend Mother , that certain goods  --  a piece of fine lawn  --  can not be found . It was laid out here to be used for the new surplice for His Eminence . p. 38 ABBESS I do not like this . Tell me what you know of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I returned here , the door to the Sacristy Closet was open  --  ABBESS Who was here at the time ? SISTER SACRISTAN Sister Benvenuta was left here . When I returned she was gone , and the closet was open , and the lawn  --  GRIMANA interceding.I beg you , Reverend Mother  --  ABBESS Sister Grimana , I have given you your task . Be about it . Grimana touches the buttons of her cape one by one , and then turns and goes out . Sister , remember that the Sister Benvenuta comes of the noble house of the Loredanl . Guard your tongue . The Sister Sacristan stands gloomily biting her lips . If she has removed the cloth to some other place , it does not matter . Remember who she is , and that she is after all a child in mind , in heart . We will speak no more of this . SISTER SACRISTAN No , Reverend Mother . ABBESS Send Sister Rosalba to me . SISTER SACRISTAN She is coming now , Reverend Mother . Rosalba comes in and the Sister Sacristan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Benvenuta , Sister . ROSALBA I will fetch her , Reverend Mother . ABBESS One moment . You have observed her of late ? ROSALBA Yes , Mother . ABBESS She seems pale , and not so strong as she was . And her mind  --  but then she was always a simple child . ROSALBA Of course , I do not know the cause of her pallor . Perhaps a penance she is undergoing secretly . The suggestion is half a question as are those of the Abbess as well . She is still very young , Reverend Mother . ABBESS She has confided nothing to you , nor to Grimana ? ROSALBA Not to me , Mother . Shall I call Sister Grimana ? ABBESS No . Send Benvenuta to me . And ask Grimana to send the novice Atalanta also  --  a little later . Rosalba goes out . The Abbess goes over and examines the Sacristy Closet door , tries the lock , finds it fast , and returns to her chair . Benvenuta enters . She is more pale than before , and looks frailer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are wide , and rove about the room , and her expression is of one who has found her happiness . The Abbess speaks to her kindly. p. 40 ABBESS My child , I have called you to me because you have seemed so pale , and I fear you have burdened yourself beyond your strength . BENVENUTA No , Reverend Mother . I am not burdened . ABBESS You are not performing any secret penance ? BENVENUTA None , Mother . ABBESS Answer me truly , Benvenuta . You have not been contemplating some penance , and so been filled with anxiety . BENVENUTA I look for no penance in this life , Reverend Mother , beyond such as may be imposed upon me . ABBESS Nothing beyond your strength will be imposed . If you have need of more sleep , I would be willing to relax for you , for a time . BENVENUTA I do not need it , Reverend Mother . Atalanta enters , sees the Abbess , and stands waiting . ABBESS If you should find yourself overburdened , little Sister , come to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atalanta steps forward . Benvenuta starts to go , but lingers . I shall need your help with the lute tonight . I know you play it well . The best lute player among the lay sisters is ill . You can play from notes ? p. 41 BENVENUTA If it be not too difficult , Reverend Mother . ABBESS It is simple . But I will have them give you the music , against the time when you will be needed . The Abbess goes out toward the Chapel . Benvenuta comes down to Atalanta . BENVENUTA Atalanta , dear ! ATALANTA Yes , Benvenuta . BENVENUTA There is something I must talk to you about . I have put it off because I have been deep in my own thoughts . You told me not so long ago that you could not find your call , that the world still beckoned you . ATALANTA Yes , it did . But I have been calmer since we spoke of it . There was a thing in my heart that had to be spoken out  --  BENVENUTA Yes . ATALANTA I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has not troubled me . BENVENUTA It was about the vinedresser 's baby in your father 's garden ? ATALANTA Yes . BENVENUTA You told me about it here  --  in this room , was it not ? ATALANTA Yes . Surely it was here . How strangely you speak , Benvenuta . Have you forgotten ? it was after that you asked me to get the gold thread , and the child 's coat . p. 42 BENVENUTA So I did . I had almost forgotten it . ATALANTA It was a great comfort to me to tell you , Sister  --  and to serve you . Why have you asked nothing more of me ? BENVENUTA I have all the help I need , now . A pause . Atalanta looks at Benvenuta wonderingly . The vinedresser 's baby  --  did you ever hold him in your arms ? ATALANTA No . BENVENUTA Nor ever felt his lips soft and moist against your cheek , nor his fingers warm on your neck ? ATALANTA No . I only saw the child , as I told you . BENVENUTA I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Benvenuta is looking toward the Sacristy closet . Atalanta , dear , do you know that we can only be happy by pleasing those we love most  --  that is what people live for , I think . And dear , remember this : the happiness you saw on the face of the vinedresser 's wife was as torment beside the joy that is glowing in me . Her eyes meet Atalanta 's for a moment . Do n't , dear  --  do n't think it too strange . Everything is strange , after all . ATALANTA Your face was like hers , then . p. 43 BENVENUTA Please do n't say that , dear . It 's  --  it 's foolish  --  is n't it ? But I told you once I was waiting for something  --  all my life waiting . And now  --  and now ! She touches Atalanta 's head , lightly , and goes off upstairs toward her cell . Atalanta is left looking after her . Grimana comes in . GRIMANA Well , mistress . Prideful over not sitting with the novices this night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , does it ? ATALANTA Oh , Sister Grimana , I  --  She stops , confused . GRIMANA What is it , child ? ATALANTA It 's Benvenuta . Have you seen her ? Have you ?  --  GRIMANA Yes , dear , I 've seen . She 's young . These times come to all of us , I suppose . But they pass . Calm , child . Count your buttons . ATALANTA I was frightened , Sister Grimana . GRIMANA Aye , you 'll frighten the novices just so in your turn . But just the same , I wish she would n't  --  The Abbess renters , as a bell strikes from the chapel . Rosalba comes on from the left , with two or three sisters. p. 44 ABBESS it is time . Let us all proceed to the chapel . The Sister Sacristan carrying the lute and some music , enters from the chapel . Are all the sisters assembled ? SISTER SACRISTAN All save those who are here , and Sister Benvenuta . ABBESS Please you , Sister Grimana , go for Benvenuta . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lute , Atalanta Badoer . The notes are clear , and the times you are to play them are written there . ATALANTA My hands tremble so . I 'm afraid I shall fail in it . ABBESS Courage , child . I know it is the first time , but you will do well  --  I am sure you will do well . Come , let us take our places . Grimana enters on the steps , in great trouble of mind . She carries in her hand the puppet of the Beelzebubb , twisted and shattered and singed with fire . GRIMANA Reverend Mother , forgive me . I have seen  --  I have seen  --  She clasps and unclasps her hands , unable to speak . ABBESS What was it , Grimana ? GRIMANA I scarcely know , Mother . Mary be my shield ! p. 45 ABBESS Speak , Sister . GRIMANA There was a great light through every crevice of the door of her cell . And music in the air  --  like harps and viols d'amour . And on the floor outside I found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And from within , sounds  --  ABBESS Tell me all , Sister . GRIMANA her fingers on the buttons of her cape.Sounds as of a mother and her babe , cooing and kissing and caressing each other . ABBESS Call the Father Confessor . The Sister Sacristan goes out toward the chapel . We must look to this . If her mind have broken under some penance  --  ATALANTA Let me go  --  ABBESS No . She was so pale  --  The Sister Sacristan returns with the Abbe Filosi . Reverend Father , the little sister of the house of Loredan  --  Then , the upper corridor is filled with a growing light  --  the same radiant gold that streamed from the Sacristy closet . The sisters bless themselves and most of them fall on their knees . In the light Benvenuta appears walking erect , her lameness gone , and holding before her the Christ Child , in a wondrous robe of carmine silk damask . She laughs softly with the babe as she passes , and when she has passed off toward the chapel , whence the organ is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a hushed voice.A miracle ! ABBESS She is healed ! A miracle of the Holy Child . Blessed Mother  --  thy Holy Child in our house . Atalanta goes swiftly up the steps and off after Benvenuta . ABBE FILOSI Let there be a special service of thanksgiving . ABBESS Let all hearts be uplifted ! Atalanta returns , trailing her lute behind her , and sinks down at the head of the stairway , sobbing.
