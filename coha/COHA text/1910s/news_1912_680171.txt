txt There are a few underlying facts as to China which it would be well to keep in mind at this moment , when so many , stories of big loans are being floated . The new republic must have money , and a good deal of it , in order to become a stable government , able to Keep a fair degree of peace and order in its wide-stretched and widely varying territories with their differing and sometimes warring populations . The money . must be borrowed on as good terms and for as long a time as possible , for the revenues , uncertain and defective even under the empire , are now much disorganized . Obviously it Is to the interest of all Governments and nations having dealings with China that this money be raised , and that it be spent wisely and for the best results . And this fin , valves a certain degree of friendly watchfulness and guidance on the part of the lenders toward the borrowers . The condition is not , naturally , altogether flattering , to the pride of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but there Is nothing in it that need wound sensible and practical statesmen .

Hence , possibly , the little flock of attractive and fast-flying " canards " that have been set fluttering from various financial centres , the facts hack Of Which have proved somewhat elusive to careful inquiry . There is , however , trio evidence so far that the responsible Chinese authorities have closed , or intend to close , the door to the negotiation in which they have engaged . There is none that they are " off with the old love " or that they are really 4011 with the new . " At most , a little harmless and possibly stimulating flirtation appears to be all to which they have any desire to commit themselves . The question of adequate loans on Suitable terms to the Republic of China Is one of very great ' importance , commercially and politically , for the people of China , and for the rest of the world . It is also one of great magnitude and some difficulty . We have little doubt that the problems it presents will , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success .
