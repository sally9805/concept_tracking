txt The Vote in Congress . In these days of important legislation and proposed legislation so vitally affecting national interest , policy , and honor . it is the right and I believe it to be the duty of every citizen to know and consider the attitude taken by his representatives in the Senate and House . Ile has a right to know whether Ms representatives vote for or against , advocate or oppose , a certain bill or policy . I have frequently searched the newspapers to find the action of my representatives along certain lines , but generally am unable to tell what their attitude has been . I believe that the paper that will regularly give the names of Senators and Representatives voting for Or against proposed legislation or resolutions , either on the floor of Congress or in committees , would be of immense value to the American people , and that such papers would be searched frequently for the Information contained .
