 | The schoolhouse squats dour and silent in its acre of weeds . A little to the rear two wretched outbuildings . Upon its gray clapboarded sides , window blinds hang loose and window sashes sag away from their frames . Groaning upon one hinge the vestibule door turns away from lopsided steps , while a broken drain pipe sways perilously from the east corner of the roof . Within and beyond the vestibule is the schoolroom , a monotony of grimy walls and smoky ceiling . Cross lights from the six windows shine upon rows of desks of varying sizes and in varying stages of destruction . A kitchen table faces the door . Squarely in the middle of the rough pine floor stands a jacketed stove . A much torn dictionary and a dented water pail stand side by side on the shelf below the one blackboard . And this is the " little red schoolhouse " to which I looked forward so eagerly during the summer ? nothing but a tumbledown shack set in the heart of a prosperous farming district of southern Wisconsin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Department of Education of the Russell Sage Foundation makes it plain that just such dilapidation is the rule in our country schools . There are , of course , exceptions . In Washington and California , the country school is generally good . The other extreme is found in the southeastern states , South Carolina and Georgia , for instance . But there is hope for Wisconsin . Unlike any other state , she has a Board of Public Affairs , which is charged with the duty of prying into all her institutions and finding out what is the matter with them . It was in the year 1911 that the board undertook to look into rural school conditions . In that same year it was announced that a fund for a five-year test of field training for public service had been raised by Mrs. E. H. Harriman and that the New York Bureau of Municipal Research was to conduct the test . Dr. William H. Allen was appointed director of this new department , the Training School for Public Service , as it is called . To him came an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rural school conditions and needs in Wisconsin , " an invitation which he was glad to accept because " 1,400,000 of Wisconsin 's 2,500,000 people are in rural communities and because no field of public service more needs to have its men and its methods tested than does the field of public education . " So it came about that Dr. Allen brought his young men out to Wisconsin and turned them loose to peep and pry and find out all they could about our country schools . They have already made a general study of schools in twentyseven counties and a detailed investigation into 131 schools in thirteen representative counties . The results of these investigations have now become public . Their report shows that , while my schoolhouse may be a bit below the average in appearance , it is on a level with the rest in most other matters . Uncleanliness is the rule . Only one-fourth of Wisconsin 's country schools have their floors scrubbed once a month . The remaining three-fourths are so treated once a year ? or less . In thirteen schools it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had ever been done . This aversion to floor scrubbing quite naturally extends to outbuildings . The  | report says : " Indescribable conditions were found in some cases . " In sixty-six schools they discovered the closets were thoroly cleaned once a year : in thirteen schools twice yearly : and in the remaining schools , forty per cent of the whole , either not at all or at least not within the memory of the oldest inhabitant . Not only were things generally bad , but not one school was found which conformed to all the minimum requirements in regard to toilets , i. e. : Where 1 . They were scrubbed once a month . 2 . They were cleaned out thoroly underneath twice a year . 3 . They were inspected once a day by the teacher and once a week by a school officer . 4 . They were thirty feet apart . 5 . They were thirty feet distant from the school building . 6 . They were thoroly screened . With such conditions in Wisconsin , which has some laws relating to sanitary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affairs in the twelve states which have no legislation whatever on this subject . Another sanitary sin lies in the use of common drinking cups . We have laws prohibiting their presence in the public schools , but it is a difficult matter to enforce . It is small wonder that the children fail to see the importance of using the individual cups when at home they see father and mother , the hired man and the baby drinking from the same dipper ? and thriving . The numerical showing is pretty good since the report announces the use of individual drinking cups in eighty-four schools , but it goes on to point out that : " Of the eighty-four schools where the individual drinking cups were in use , only two provided dustproof cabinets for the cups . In the majority of cases the danger of infection was not decreased by the use of individual cups in actual practise . " Personally I can not see how the " danger of infection " will ever be decreased so long as schools fail to be provided with wells and cups go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case of the individual drinking cups , the numerical showing is quite as bad as the actuality where desks are concerned . In my schoolroom they are so arranged that the smaller ones line up across the front of the room and proceed in a series of steps to the back , where the largest seats are to be found . This practise is almost universal and results in a high seat going with a low desk . The fact that out of 4265 such sittings investigated by the Training School experts , only ninety-four , or two per cent , could be adjusted in any manner , needs no comment . The little children 's feet dangle midway between the seat and the floor and the big boys whack their knees and bend their backs to accommodate themselves to this senseless arrangement . It is rather a notable fact , that altho there is no larger class of sedentary workers in all America than our school children , there are only five states which have any regulations at all covering seats and desks . The children have no union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have succeeded in securing legislation governing matters of ventilation and drafts in factories , but nothing has been done along this line for our country schools . We have an excellent stove and a good ventilating device ? due probably to the subvention of fifty dollars given by the state as a reward to the districts installing them ? but we can not keep warm even so . Currents of cold come in thru the windows and up thru the cracks in the floor and the rottenness of the building destroys the effectiveness of the one really good bit of furniture in the schoolhouse . But this is true everywhere . Only one state , Ohio , has complete laws respecting schoolhouse construction . Fifteen others exercize a moderate degree of control ; thirteen have very deficient regulations , and in nineteen no attempt at all is made to compel proper building . Such regulations as there are in the several states are not adequately enforced according to the Russell Sage Foundation report . If our windows do let in too much cold air , they can not be charged with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that every schoolhouse shall have 1 . Windows on one side or on two ad- jacent sides only with the major light coming over the left shoulders of the pupils . 2 . Windows properly curtained with opaque and translucent curtains . 3 . Windows running practically to the ceiling . 4 . Narrowest piers possible between windows ? not over fifteen inches . 5 . White ceilings and walls tinted a soft light green or gray , restful to the eye and nerves and having high reflecting quality . No one schoolhouse in the State of Wisconsin fulfils all of these requirements , while the great majority fulfil none of them . Even where schoolhouses are new and put up without regard to cost and with the best of intentions , the lighting is wrong . This is the least understood feature of building , it would seem . Even if all these things were correct , even if all the schoolhouses were well built , and the light good , it would still fall far short of the ideal were there no more attention paid to the matter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here a yard of great natural possibilities , but it has been denuded of its original growth of trees ? the usual method of " clearing " adopted by school boards ? and nothing has ever been done to beautify or even keep clean the barren ugly plot which they left . Similarly there is not one work of art on the walls of the schoolroom , my Remington excepted . I have been told that it would not pay the school board to invest in " sich " ? the children would not appreciate them . It is , perhaps , just as well that the judgment of the average school board is not called into action in the matter of buying works of art for the schoolroom : but the delight of the children in the picture mentioned , in its brilliantly beautiful coloring as well as in the story which it tells , is quite sufficient proof that they do appreciate " sich . " But perhaps it is too much to expect beauty within our country schools when the esthetic movement is still so new in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schoolhouse stands a long low building painted a rich red . It is warmly built . Adequate provision has been made for light and air according to the latest and most advanced ideas . Also it cost $2000 and houses a lot of hogs . The schoolhouse is worth barely $100 , and any good farmer knows that no self-respecting hog would thrive in it . But hogs can be sold and children can not . It must be conceded , however , that if a farmer saw a hog and a child drowning in a mud wallow , he would save the child and let the hog go . It is not at all that he does not love his children : it is only that he is , like most of us , shortsighted , and the dollar in the hog is much nearer and more apparent than the dollars in the child . It is interesting to note that , in the states where the rights of children are respected , the greatest amount of money is expended upon their education ; while in states where child labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put into the schools is shamefully small . Thirteen states invest less than $20 per annum per child in the school plant ; Massachusetts pays out for this purpose $115 per child , New York coming next with $111 . Mississippi , on the other hand , lavishes $4 per child every year on school grounds and buildings , while the Carolinas and Georgia compete with each other for next worse place . The Sage Foundation ranks Wisconsin very low in this respect , along with Delaware , Maryland , Kansas and a number of other Western and Southern states . The farmer has been called the " backbone of the nation , " but one may be permitted to wonder just what sort of a backbone the farmer 's child is going to be when , in the institution which is supposed to fit him for citizenship , he meets with conditions which twist his spine out of shape , ruin his eyes , breed tuberculosis and dull his perceptions ? not only of outward and visible beauty , but of mental concepts ? ideas , of the power of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And the answer to one 's wondering is already apparent and will become more and more evident if this statement is allowed to hold true : The child : the hog : : $100 : $2000.
