txt England and America . On the eve of my departure from New ' York , after a sojourn of only eight days , I should be glad of space M your columns to tell your readers , as an Englishman and as a member for many years of the corporation of our ancient City of London , how deeply I have been Impressed by the appreciative and even affectionate recognition which I find prevailing on this side of the Atlantic and among my American cousins , of the noble part in the cause of humanity which old England has played and is playing In the present European troubles . It is many years since I landed in your city on my first visit , and my dominating feeling then was the wonderful fact that all around me , thousands of miles from home , I heard the English language spoken . On this , my present visit , I have been oven more impressed by the fact that not only has the language of my home land found a home here , but that the traditional code @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the constant striving for the cause of civil ization , which are inseparable from the Britisher , are equally integral parts of the American character . I firmly believe that so long as the Englishspeaking people preserve and practice these traditional attributes , the aims of civilization can not be defeated , or even checked , from whomsoever attacks may come .
