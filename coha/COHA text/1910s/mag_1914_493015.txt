Democracy its own Critic THE educational influence of cooperation may be seen in this , that in every working hour the principles of the self-managed life have to be practiced . That fateful question , " What will the people do when they get power ? " has explicit answer among more than twenty millions of work ? ing cooperators . Large sections of these have got this power . They have got the most difficult and most important form of it , that which mainly deter ? mines their own economic and business life . In two generations they have nowhere seriously abused it . If cooperation succeeds , it is the one school in which no mere phrase-maker , promoter or get-rich-quick adventurer has the slightest chance , the one school in which the large and airy claims of every " ism " are roundly brought to book . Cooperation shuts the door upon no revolution ? ary suggestion , but insists that those who promise big things shall make good . In great variety it of ? fers actual field practice where social theories may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perform no useful service ; that all middlemen are parasites ; that the main deviltries are " social " and not in the individual ; that competition is essentially an evil to be removed ; that it is easy to build up and maintain large business and keep labor in good humor ? all such have a chance in cooperative en ? terprise to confirm or to revise their opinions . In the store , insurance , credit and banking , ele ? vator , buying and selling associations , cooperation is , indeed , a history of revised opinions . The labor question is very largely a struggle over the control of applied inventions . Labor thinks there would be no trouble over putting in new machinery if only the machines were owned by the people . Yet in hundreds of cooperative factories and workshops the workers do own the machines and can do with them as they like . They are quick to put them in if no one is to be thrown out of a job . But when that danger is serious and immediate , the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and women may then and there be dropped . These cooperators can not make a scapegoat of capitalists , who are supposed to own all machinery . That most staggering of questions , how to keep surplus labor continually and productively at work , comes like a challenge into labor 's own camp . Without evasion , these fellow workers have to fight this out , with the result that not one of them is left wholly uneducated on this haunting problem which , thus far , no one in the world has had wit enough to meet . To show that no fanciful claim is here made for the penetrating power of this self-criticism , we have only to look at cooperative industry and the markets which it has created in at least ten countries . When factories , mills and farms begin to produce for the cooperative market , thousands of working men and women have to be hired , as in private industry . English cooperators , for example , have more than 100,000 hired workers . The wholesale alone has 5,000 in its distribution and 13,000 in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor this raises every vexatious issue under which ordinary employ ? ers suffer . Cooperative committees chosen by work ? ingmen have to deal with trade unions fighting for higher wages , shorter hours and better conditions . There can be no sentimental shirking of these bristling difficulties . Shall the cooperative store or manufactory adopt profit-sharing ? The entire bulk of academic discussion on this supposed remedy has very slight value compared to nearly fifty years of working-class experience with this device . Literally thousands of experiments with it have failed . Profit-sharing in the " self-governing workshop " is largely a record of disappointment . In the far more efficient consumers ' cooperation , profit-shar ? ing , after innumerable trials , has been pretty nearly abandoned . Though strikes are comparatively rare , this army of employees does now and then threaten to go , or actually does go , on strike , bringing sharp ? ly to the front the conflict of interest between the workman striving for high wages and the consumer asking for cheap products . There is no more mo ? mentous question than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it is being threshed out within the cooperative movement . Those who run cooperative enterprises have to make their own working compromises on these points . Catherine of Russia told the philosopher Diderot that it was easy to manage men in the pages of a book , but " I have to write on the ticklish human skin . " With wages , hours , prices , welfare work , strikes and piece work , cooperators are as close to the skin as the Great Queen . I heard an old cooperator say , " We have one fat-head who thinks our shirt factory can be run on a five-hour working day without piece work , and another one who thinks wages should be paid ' ac ? cording to need . ' " This last purely communistic proposal , like the whimsical insistence of Bernard Shaw that everybody shall receive the same in ? come , would nowhere get more drastic judgment than among cooperators who had built up a thriving business . It is they who have learned , like the eleven hundred cooperative gangs in northern Italy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for in ? stance , is as humanly necessary as it is useful . Wherever labor secures control , , it often adopts methods and sanctions conditions which it had bit ? terly opposed when it was dependent on employers who withheld such secrets as capitalization , the sal-ary basis , what was written off for depreciation , etc . The suspicion of labor has become so aroused on these points , so insistent upon knowing why its claims can not be met , that our industrial peace is at stake . Labor 's demand to know these things carries with it an invincible justice . Until it knows , labor will sulk , and will limit production , and breed no end of crude syndicalist revolts . Now cooperation , though it will do but a part of the world 's work , is the one educational field on which labor learns to know and to respect those severe economic exigencies under which production and distribution have got to go on in this world . No seasoned cooperator can be fooled by fairy ? tales about the motives of men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just now for the " minimum wage . " In its own interest , society has got to accept that principle and learn to apply it . It will require decades and be attended with sickening failures . Its adoption assumes that we frankly put a certain standard of life and security before and above profit-making . English cooperators have for years struggled with this issue of the minimum wage . From the first , cooperation eliminates the private profit-making principle . The whole mechan ? ism of business is to be subordinated to the needs of life . Neither machine nor organization is there to victimize and enslave the worker . Both are there to serve him and to enrich his life . Many an American hustler has left an European cooperative factory with disgust because " they take it so easy . " The observation is correct , but the inference at fault . These cooperators know perfectly well what they are doing when they knock off for a picnic or refuse some appeal to work overtime . They want a rational leisure more than they want a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We are not quite so efficient in this mill as some of the private profit-makers , but now that we control our own business , it is for us to decide under what pressure we will work . " Twenty years ago , critics thought this lower ? ing of efficiencies would prove fatal to the move ? ment . For years the English Women 's Cooperative Guild has been agitating the minimum wage among its women workers . It was seen that the principle was already theirs . The difficulties of its applica ? tion were , however , so formidable that not until last year was the matter decided . The long record of this discussion shows with what discrimination they have dealt with this thorny subject . The cooperative wholesale , in its distributive and productive depart ? ments , has some seven thousand women . It first cautiously granted the minimum wage to women in the distributive departments , and on January I , 1914 , to those in the manufacturing departments . The scale is set according to age from fourteen to twenty years . Thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hosiery works , the principle goes into effect , as well as in nearly two hundred outside distributive societies . In this illustration we see one set of elected wage-earners acting as employers of labor , sobered by responsibilities which make men wise in the " science of the possible . " Precisely because the rigors of the actual industrial world have carried their own chastening into these labor groups , we find them educated in the sobrieties on which all democracy must at last rest . It is both the charm and the promise of the movement that these rigors have left no chill on the idealism from which the cooperative fellowship sprang . Its history is that of democracy learning to know itself and its limi ? tations in the world . In noting finally the educational discipline of this self-criticism among the many thousands of dis ? tinctively socialistic cooperators , we shall see that no college in this or any other land offers sounder or more needed instruction both for social order and for social progress .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
