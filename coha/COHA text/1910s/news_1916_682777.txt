txt During a recent trip to Germany I had occasion to talk most intimately with all sorts of German people . I remember a most intelligent Bavarian farmer whom I met in an inn on the Thuringian border . This countryman , though nearly 70 years of age , was still hale and hearty and hoped that he might be called to the colors . " Three times , " he I said to me , " I have had the honor of serving my King , and I am quite ready for the fourth call.a " I presume . " I answered , " that you I served against the Danes in 1866 and against the French in 1870 . What was the other occasion ? " " Oh , " he said , " we were all under arms and expected to be used against Prussia in 1866 , but we never got to the front . " " So you served your King against Prussia in 1866 and for Prussia in 1870 . What did you think about such a right about face as that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't think I My officers never ordered me to think . I served my King and obeyed orders and that was the end of it . " A young woman of about 22 , an actress by profession , shared the general enthusiasm for the German arms . She detlared to me that if the worst came to the worst " we women shall take up arms and follow the standards of our Ktliger " " But , " I replied , " you just told me that you were out of work and out of money , that your parents have been made poor by the war , and that you were at your wits ' end as to getting your bread and butter . I should think that yoa would be contemplating the eN 1 n ce of peace and an honest job . " " Oh you Americans ! " she exclaimed . " How can you understand patriotism ? Of course , in order to truly love your countr : , you must be devoted to an individual monarch . You Americans are ruled by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among yourselves . You ought to see our Kaiser in one of his wdnderful uniforms , wearing his gold helmet , his sabre , and his high hoots . I assure you you would then feel patriotic for the old country of your fathers . " For a third example let me describe a meeting with a radical Socialist wearing the gray uniform of a Prussian infantry regiment . This Socialist hated .. the army , hated the Kaiser , and hated Till . war . He had , within ten years . given of his savings to support the London dock laborers ' strike , the Belgian equal suffrage strike , and the Rus , : an revolution . Now he has , within three months , killed English , Belgian , and French wiorkmen . Why , " I asked , " in the name of everything on earth you hold sacred , do you wear that uniform ? " " What do you mean ? I am called out . I must serve . " I changed the ' subject of conversationThis man 's mind was absolutely incapable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well enough , he might , of course , volunteer or refuse to volunteer . In . Germany be was " called out . " That ended it . Imagine David Farragut or George A. Thomas of Virginia being forced by the State of Virginia into the service of the Confederacy and then serving without question : Imagine Valla.ndingham of Ohio being drafted by the Union into service against the Confederacy ! Trying to explain political freedom and political conscience to a German in Germany is like trying to explain light and color to one born blind . Three years ago the virtues of the German people and their distinguished services to the world made Germany ; r red throughout America . Today both pre corning to be despised by nearly all but the Germans themselves . I do not ' believe that the real Germany  --  the Germany of the past three-quarters of a century , through which we must observe the Germany of the present , has yet been understood by the American people . I do not think that it is even fully understood by that small group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The mind of Germany in matters political and governmental remains where it was 200 years ago To arrive at that point again the intellectual and middle classes of . Germany have , during the last sixty years , suffered political degeneration . This fact is of primary importance . I shall endeavor in succeeding articles to cite the historical facts which furnish an adequate explanation . Here I shall briefly summarize . Germany has failed to play her ailotted ' part in this century because she failed to win democracy and political civilization in 1843 . It was the mission of the great political revolutions which lie at the roots of modern civilization to do more than secure democratic Political government for Western Europe and America . Those revolutions were themselves a part of a tremendous moral evolution in the minds of individuals and in their common social relationships . This saving process has been denied Germany and the Germans because of the failure of ' 48 . As yet no American of German birth or blood has told the truth concerning this matter . My father having been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider it to be both a right and a duty on my part to state the case for the sadly forgotten democracy of Germany . FRANK BOHN . New Yoilt .
