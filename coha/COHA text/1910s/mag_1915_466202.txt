INTER had passed , and the yellow patches of blooming crocuses in Lafayette Square gave evidence that spring had already arrived , as the Hon. Mr. Leaduson , M.C. , paused for a moment on the asphalt pathway near the center of the square . The reason was soon evident , for the venerable figure of his friend , Mr. Justice Evenweight , who had just left the White House grounds , was slowly approaching . As the two met near the spot where General Jackson rides his frantic steed , the Representative extended his hand in salutation as he exclaimed , " I was this very moment thinking of your " And , what is equally strange , I was thinking of you , " returned the Judge . " I was just lamenting the fact that our fond hopes of last December have melted away with the departing snows . Congress will soon adjourn , and I see that your plan for standardizing the diplomatic service is not yet out of its cradle . " " You are right , " fr was the reply ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and at present it is tranquilly sleeping ; but you will yet find that this infant has a voice , and is every day gathering new vigor for making itself heard . When it awakes , its cry will resound from Boston to San Francisco . Then alI the politics in the world can not rock it to sleep again . " " You arc an optimist , Leaduson , " replied the Judge , laughing . " As for me , I have about abandoned hope . You evidently go upon the principle that whatever is reasonable will happen . I have too often seen the unreasonable triumph , at least for a very long time . Aristotle , you remember , defined ' man ' as a rational animal , ' and he was partly right , for undoubtedly man possesses reason ; but it is too frequently adormant faculty . The world seems to be governed by interests and passions , rather than by principles . The chief trouble is that we Americans are such busy people we have no time for any but the most practical questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of us . We are all preoccupied with our private interests , and these are only remotely touched by questions pertaining to the diplomatic service . " " Do you really believe that ? " inquired the Representative , as they turned to pursue their way together . " I once regarded this whole matter as of slight importance , but I have come to think that we are all affected by the success or failure of American policies , which have in recent years become so wrapped up with world politics that we can not escape being benefited or injured by what is going on outside of our own country and by the attitude of other nations toward us . We can not afford to lose our national prestige in the world , and especially in our own hemisphere . " " You speak of the importance of American policies . I have just been reading a book on foreign trade , in which the author says : ' The United States is not found guilty of a continuous foreign policy , except on the broadest and most fundamental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true . What is the use of diplomatists without a policy ? And what is the use of a policy that is merely casual , extemporaneous , and inconstant ? The truth is , we are in danger of getting the cart before the horse in this matter . We talk of a ' service ' without having first considered what ends are to be served . If the people really felt the need of something , if they had before them definite lines of action in the field of diplomacy , they would be anxious enough about results , and about the agencies by which results were to be produced . As it is , they are still asking the question which an eminent American jurist asked about twenty years ago , when , after it was remarked that a certain action would create a bad impression abroad , ' he scornfully demanded , What have we to do with abroad ? ' " " That might have sounded well enough twenty years ago , " replied the Representative " but it will not do to talk in that way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests in every quarter of the globe . Twenty years ago the whole volume of the foreign trade of the United States amounted to only a little more than a billion and a half dollars , our exports being mostly the product of our fields ; but to-day it is nearly five billions , and our manufactures are largely represented . Our people are reaching out for a still greater share in the world 's market . One of the tasks of diplomacy is to extend and protect the industrial and commercial interests of our citizens . To do so effectively requires not only intelligent guidance , but extensive knowledge ; not merely scraps of information pigeonholed in government departments , but a comprehensive grasp of the state and conditions of trade throughout the world , to be acted upon in conference with our enterprising business men , and vigorously reinforced by persons who , through their accomplishments and experience , would be qualified to stand with the expert diplomatic representatives of competing countries . Behind all this , however , there must be a clearly detind general policy which will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Do you not think we are a little too home-bred for that ? " retorted the Judge . " Do you fancy that our political methods will ever take much account of foreign conditions ? For my part , I am of the opinion that our people have made two mistakes , and are likely to go on making them : first , in thinking that other governments are as indefinite in their foreign policies as our own ; and , second , in considering all foreigners as in some way our inferiors , and thus underestimating their powers of competition . As a matter of fact , they have been in the habit of sending us back some of our own products , after increasing their value by from sixty to eighty per cent . by the skill they have exercised upon them . Worst of all , our exports are often resold in foreign markets at a handsome profit to the foreign dealer , because we ourselves do not yet know how to place them . We not only send them in foreign ships ; we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I am aware of these facts , Judge , " remarked the Representative ; " and I know , too , that we are behind other countries in the support we offer to our foreign trade , in spite of the fact that we have recently given it much attention . One great obstacle to our success is found in the fact that it is in our traditions as a people to regard public office as an honor to be sought rather than as a position of service to the community . In our business life we seek out and employ the most qualified experts for every branch of industry , but in our public life expert knowledge and experience have often counted for nothing . Of late years we have come to realize the value of training in the merely clerical positions ; but these , of course , have no influence upon questions of public policy , and no competency for the formation of great plans requiring continuity of action in their execution . In the higher and responsible offices we have no standard of fitness and little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for purely political reasons . Every new chief , after he has learned from the permanent staff the alphabet of his office , is anxious to distinguish his brief administration by some innovation , which is usually merely experimental and is often soon abandoned . How can we expect our official novitiates to equal the veterans with whom they have to do business ? It is not surprising that we always remain in our official childhood , with little prospect of ever growing up I " " You seem to overlook , " returned the Judge , " the advantages resulting from frequent changes in office . We , at least , very soon get rid of palpable incompetence . " The Representative , who had not no-ticed the expression dcountenance with which this remark was uttered , gazed at the Judge a moment in mute surprise . " So you are content , are you , " he queried , " to rest the fortunes of the country upon the mere chances of politics ? I am seeking a real remedy , not simply a mental palliative . I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge in the highest as well as the lowest places . What does the protection of the civil service amount to if it only succeeds in keeping at their desks a number of government clerks , and can do nothing to secure special fitness in those who direct their activities ? it is a good deal like placing a well-disciplined army under the command of an untrained general . " " I entirely agree with you , " replied the Judge , smiling , " but we have no method in our system of government for distinguishing between our fellow-citizens . I recall the remark of Lowell , that one man is as good as another until a real man is wanted . ' The practical difficulty is in finding the ' real man ' at the moment when he is most needed . " " How would it do to keep him on hand , when you have once found him ? " insinuated the Representative . The Judge laughed sympathetically , and answered : " It would be difficult to do that until we have radically changed our conception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never grown up to the idea of public servants . ' We have been taught to regard public offices as ' honors ' and rewards . ' which men are supposed to deserve ' ? not for their qualifications or past public services , but for the devotion they have shown to a party or a person . We sometimes call these offices jobs , ' which is relatively innocent ; and even spoils , ' which illustrates how far we are from a right estimation of what offices ' really are intended to be . I have often wished that some philologist would trace for us the history of the Latin word officia from its original meaning down to the degenerate use we make of it . Imagine an American school-boy translating Cicero 's famous essay on Duties , ' De Offieiis , as ' Concerning Spoils ' ! " " But how can we expect an improvement in our public life , and especially anything so mature as a consistent foreign policy ? which can not be created in a day ? so long as we regard official position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service ? " demanded the Representative . " The difficulty with which we have to contend is , really , hostile to the spirit of our institutions . It is a survival of an aristocratic regime which we have intended to abolish . It is as much as possible undemocratic to consider that public offices have been designed as ' honors . ' That conception belongs to an entirely different system of things . We ridicule the European passion for ' orders ' as an exhibition of aristocratic pride , and we forbid our public officers to accept them from foreign governments ; and yet the foreign practice is , in one respect at least , more sensible than ours . Is it not more reasonable to obtain the service first , and bestow the ' honor ' afterward , in the form of approval of the way the service has been performed ? We , on the contrary , make the office itself the honor ' ; and the longer it is held , and the more qualified the incumbent is to continue to perform its duties , the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' He has already had his plum ' " Wo n't you come in and lunch with me ? " asked the Judge as they paused for a moment before a large brick dwelling which the latter was evidently intending to enter . " I am expecting Channing , who happens to have a case in the Supreme Court , and one or two others whom I have asked by telephone to come and meet him . Everything will be quite informal . Channing and I were in college together . " " I shall be delighted to meet the Ambassador , " was the prompt reply as they ascended the steps . " I have long wanted to get his views on the subject you and I have discussed together . " A quarter of an hour later a group of six gentlemen was gathered about a round table in the Judge 's comfortable dining-room . Opposite the host sat the ex-Ambassador ? a venerable gentleman with a Greek profile that might have done credit to Praxiteles , and upon whose iron-gray head it was difficult to believe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judge 's right was placed a member of the Foreign Relations Committee of the Senate ; on CAN OUR DIPLOMATIC SERVICE his left , the Hon. Mr. Leaduson ; while the principal guest was flanked on his right by an eminent American historian , who was faced by the editor of a Western daily newspaper . " Leaduson and I , " remarked the Judge , " were discussing , when we came in together , the importance to the nation of our diplomatic service . You , my dear Channing , having been one of its brightest ornaments , should be able to tell us something about it ? particularly how it might be made more useful to the country. , , The ex-Ambassador was silent for a moment , then modestly replied : " It is a subject to which I have given much thought , but , having held but a single post , and that in a country with which our relations are excellent , I have no fixed theory about it . I can only reason from my own experience . What has most impressed me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mission I received from the Department of State only one instruction of real importance . " " In your case , Mr. Ambassador , even that must have been quite superfluous , " exclaimed the Senator . " You were in every way competent to be your own chief . " " You flatter me , Senator , " was the quick reply ; " but it was not a question of competence ; it was a question of coordinate action . There were a score of negotiations which would have involved the co-operation of several of my colleagues , and only in this single instance was there any general plan of action . I was never informed as to what any one else was doing at any other post , or how my own action was related to the action of others ; yet it was evident that the representatives of the opposing interests were not thus left in the dark . Each of the countries involved had its own system , but we had none . I do not recall that I was even once instructed to give information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That is because you kept us so well informed , " observed the Senator . " It was only toward the end of my mission that your compliment could have been deserved , Senator , " replied the Ambassador . " When I accepted my appointment I stepped without warning BE MADE MORE EFFICIENT ? 193 from a busy law-office to a position of the highest rank in the diplomatic service , without time for the slightest preparation . The so-called ' instruction period ' of thirty days gave me barely sufficient time to pack my trunks . I was in Washington for only two hours before I sailed for my post . The Secretary of State being absent , I saw no one but the Assistant Secretary . He advised me to consult the files of the department and to read over the correspondence between it and the embassy for at least the previous year , but I did not have time to do so . " " But , of course , " observed the Senator , " when you arrived at your post you found your secretaries fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' The Ambassador looked a trifle amused . " Perhaps my case was exceptional , " he continued , " but it was certainly not without embarrassment . Two weeks before my arrival the secretary of embassy had departed for another post . The second secretary was also transferred three weeks afterward . The third secretary soon resigned on account of illness , and of the three new men who came to replace this staff not one knew the language of the country . As I was myself not a linguist , having forgotten the little French I studied in college , we had no avenue of communication except through the clerks . " " Really , I am surprised to hear this , " exclaimed the Senator . " I thought our secretaries were exceptionally bright and well-educated young men . " " And so they are , , ' added the Ambassador . " All my secretaries ? and I had a number of them during my mission ? were men of college education , well-bred , charming fellows . I had no fault to find with them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they could not have been more willing to perform every duty . We were , however , altogether a rather helpless lot . " " Is it possible , " demanded the Historian , rather indignantly , " that our government continues to send out secretaries who do not know the languages ? I thought all appointees were now required at least to speak French . " " Two of my secretaries spoke French to a certain extent , and one of them spoke Russian . Another spoke Japanese ; but , as it happened , not one of them spoke the language of the country to which we were appointed . Still , I have no right to complain , for they were all better linguists than I. " " But how did it happen , " inquired the Editor , " that not one of these young men knew the language of the country ? There must be in the service others who knew it . There is , I believe , a Bureau of Appointments in the Department of State . Why were misfits sent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It was certainly not the fault of my young men that they were not better fitted for their work , " resumed the Ambassador . " They were willing to do anything demanded of them ; but , without being informed in advance , or afforded an opportunity to instruct themselves , they had been suddenly ordered to pack up , and had been transferred , at considerable expense to themselves , from the other side of the globe . One young man whose name I could mention was assigned to seven different posts in six years . If he had not possessed an ample private fortune , these removals , by which he was transferred from Egypt to Mexico , from Mexico to Athens , from Athens to Tokio , from Tokio to Berlin , from Berlin to St. Petersburg , from St. Petersburg to London , and finally from London to Paris , would have financially ruined him . As it was , he did not have time to make a deliberate study of any one of the countries in which he lived . " " But , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Appointments ever inflict upon a young man such a kaleidoscopic career as that ? It was enough to make his head swim ! " " The Bureau of Appointments has absolutely nothing to say about it , " broke in the Representative . " It is the President who makes the appointments , " observed the Senator . " It is inconceivable , " continued the Editor , " that the President should send a man to seven posts in six years . Such a performance is wholly inexplicable . " " Not at all , " responded the Representative . " The number of posts , the location of them , the preparation for them , the duration of an appointment , and the moment of transfer are questions which have never troubled the mind of any living man . The President and the Secretary of State give these matters practically no attention . The chief of the Bureau of Appointments has no authority and no responsibility whatever . He gets a card , or a list , from some one who has received orders to make certain changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . Letters or telegrams are sent to a series of men to change places . In this there is little or no consideration of personal fitness , and absolutely no previous preparation . A man who has leased an apartment for two years , who may have moved into it only two months before , is ordered to present himself within a week at a capital thousands of miles away . An excellent German scholar is sent to Spain , without knowing a word of Spanish . A man who has acquired Russian is sent to Central America . A man who is an adept in Spanish is packed off to Turkey . " " Why , this seems impossible ! " exclaimed the Editor . " The public has no idea of this . It is shameful ! " " I have made no statement , " alleged the Representative , " which I could not confirm by citing specific instances . " " Why is it that these purposeless and practically unconsidered changes are made ? " asked the Editor . " One would suppose that there must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the special qualifications of every individual in the service , together with full information regarding his condition in life , and that assignments to posts would be based upon the specific fitness of each individual for the work to be done . Not only this , but that some one in authority would be looking forward to possible contingencies and have men preparing for changes , so that , when the time came for a transfer , a man would be ready , and would he sent where his services would be most useful . No ambassador would then have occasion to say , ' we were rather a helpless lot ' 1 " " You are quite right , Mr. Editor , in your statement of what should be , " returned the Representative . " All the information you mention is on file in the Bureau of Appointments , but your plan CAN OUR DIPLOMATIC SERVICE can not go into practical operation until there is a radical change in the method of making assignments . No business man would ever adopt the method now in vogue , but we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are two vices in our present system ? personal preference and official influence . " " What do you mean ? " demanded the Senator , somewhat testily . " All candidates who enter the diplomatic and the consular services are now subjected to a preliminary examination by an examin-ing board . " " That is true , but it is not by law ; it is only by executive order , and whatever is done is without the slightest control . When men have passed the examination they must still wait for appointment . But , even when appointed , there is no person in charge of the service who has authority to place the men where they should be placed , or who is responsible for the results of their assignments . " " It is the President who is responsible , " retorted the Senator . " He nominates to a definite position , and the Senate confirms . " " Quite true , " replied the Representative . " The Senate confirms ; but do not individual Senators suggest , urge , and insist upon certain assignments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say about these appointments and transfers . That is its constitutional right . Such officers are appointed ' with the advice and consent of the Senate . ' " " Does the Senate take any responsibility for these appointments ? Does it ever in any way examine the candidate ? And , above all , does it ever concern itself with the special fitness of the particular nominee for the specific post to which he is to be assigned ? " demanded the Editor . " That , " replied the Senator , " is not considered the Senate 's business . It has a right of confirmation , and it would not confirm any one to whom a Senator from the nominee 's state seriously objected . " The President , then , must quite as seriously take into account the wishes of the Senators . When they have expressed their preferences , it is for him to choose between them . He does not , therefore , freely and spontaneously BE MADE MORE EFFICIENT ? 195 nominate . He must first negotiate Thus , it seems to me ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be obtained ? not only every original appointment , but every transfer in the service , is , in fact , a transaction , " observed the Editor . The Senator appeared somewhat perturbed , but not altogether discomfited . " Well , " he replied , after a pause , " what if there is a transaction ? The Senate does not go beyond its constitutional right . How do you interpret the expression ' with the advice and consent of the Senate ' ? " " Certainly the expression does not mean ' at the request and upon the urgency ' of one or more of the Senators , " replied the Editor , rather crisply . " And if the Senate has , as you say , the constitutional right of confirmation , what becomes of its constitutional duty in the matter ? This division of authority simply results in the elimination of all responsibility . How can the public hold the President responsible for appointments which he does not freely x make ? " " You are unreasonable , sir , " retorted the Senator with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " In a metaphysical sense , he does , " broke in the Historian , " but in a practical sense he is obliged to consult Senatorial preferences , or his nominations will not he confirmed . It appears that these preferences are sometimes not merely negative ; they are often positive , and sometimes even mandatory . Does not the President frequently defer sending in his diplomatic and consular nominations , even when vacancies have long existed , until certain legislation is previously passed by the Senate ? Is this merely for the good of the service , or does it have other bearings ? There is no one here who does not recall such instances . If necessary , I can cite them . But what relation has this selection of time to the qualifications or adaptations of the nominees ? Why are these nominations reserved until action of Congress on other matters is taken ? What have they to do with questions of general legislation ? " A somewhat embarrassing silence followed this rather searching series of interrogatories , and a suspicion seemed to be forming that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Judge , whose tact as host now seemed to be called into requisition , did not wait for a reply . " It seems to me , " he said , " hardly just to impute blame in cases where public officers have , for obviously natural reasons , drifted into a way of doing things that may not be perfectly ideal , but has , nevertheless , created a tradition that has gradually come to govern practice . " " It is far from my intention , " interrupted the Historian , " to cast aspersion upon any individual or group of individuals . We have entered upon a subject that is full of public interest because it affects the efficiency of the public service . There is , of course , nothing improper in inquiring after facts ; and it is certainly desirable that their implications be considered . We are none of us , I am sure , speaking in terms of censure . We are probably all equally interested in the public good . If our methods are wrong , our one aim should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I must confess , " observed the Senator , " that in pursuing immediate ends we have not always sufficiently considered remoter consequences . For my part , I entertain no spirit of partisanship in these matters , and I have no disposition to defend the traditions into which we have , as I think , unhappily fallen . I believe that the authors of our Constitution , in associating the Senate with the President in the appointment of public officers , intended to promote thereby the efficiency of the branches of the public service that might be affected . The aim was , no doubt , to secure the best men for the work they had to do . If the methods that have been followed are not the most efficacious for accomplishing that purpose , our plain duty is to see how we may improve them . I am sure there is not a single member of the branch of the government to which I have the honor to belong who would not say the same . " " The question is , then , " said the Judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assignments to render the foreign service more efficient ? What would you recommend , Channing ? " " Summing tip what has been said here , " replied the Ambassador , " we started out from the assumption ? or the fact , if you please ? that our foreign service is not as efficient as it might be because the men sent to particular posts are not always selected with special regard to their duties ; that they are not given a chance to be fully prepared for the special work they have to do , and that they are sometimes arbitrarily moved about . We seem to have found the cause of this in the absence of sufficient attention to the details of the service by some responsible authority who could be held accountable for the results . It has been intimated that this happens because of outside influences which affect the free and intelligent exercise of the appointing power . If this be true , the remedy would seem to lie in removing these causes and in instituting such supervision of the service as would obviate these disadvantages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If it be true that influential persons , no matter who they are , interfere with the proper conduct of the service , such interference should be made impossible . " " Do you think , Mr. Ambassador , that the reason why your staff was not , at the time you spoke of as well adapted as it might have been to the particular post , could be found in outside influences , such as the pressure of interested friends , official or non-official , for those particular appointments ? " inquired the Editor . " I am not prepared to say that , " was the prompt response . " I may be wrong , but my opinion is that the trouble resulted from the lack of system ; or , to be a little more exact , from a procedure which renders impossible any system whatever . " " I do not quite understand you , " broke in the Editor . " I mean , " the Ambassador resumed , " that , so long as it continues to be the practice for persons of influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this , that or another particular post , and to bring collateral official influence to bear in the matter of assignments , it is quite hopeless for those who , if left free to act from service considerations alone , might put the right man in the right place and keep him there , to CAN OUR DIPLOMATIC SERVICE BE MADE MORE EFFICIENT ? 197 carry out a consistent plan of action . If such influences are permitted to affect the appointments , it is impossible to secure the best results . An officer who has to depend simply upon his record , and who either can not or will not appeal to this kind of influence , is quite certain to he displaced , even at the height of his efficiency ; and another person , wholly unadapted to do his work , is likely to be assigned to it . In the army or the navy such interferences , for social or political reasons , would be utterly demoralizing . You simply can not organize a service on that basis . Conscious competency will not long submit to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You put it strongly , Charming , " said the Judge . " But what can be done to remedy it ? " " I think , " said the Editor , " the remedy is very simple . Let nominations be made to a rank , instead of to a particular post in the service . Then let a competent person , who can he held responsible for results , have complete authority to assign the individual officers to such places as he thinks them best fitted for by their record of service and their special qualifications . He could then look ahead , prepare men for their posts by instructing them regarding what they would in the future have to do , and thus render them ready for new tasks when their services were needed . " " And where will you find the perfect angel who , with a mind bent only on his task , and free from prejudice and partiality , would constitute the dents ex machina of this ideal system ? " inquired the Senator . " It would be an office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want it , and hardly any one would be fitted for it . " The Judge looked quizzically at the Representative , and a fleeting smile passed over his benevolent countenance . " That seems to take us back to where we started in our conversation this morning , Leaduson , " he said . " " Yes , " was the prompt reply . " But , after all , the chief problem of human government is to find competent men entirely devoted to the performance of their duties , for without them no public policy can bear its best fruit . " VOL . CXXX. - Nu. 776. - 25 " Without them , I would say , sound public policies can not even be formulated , " observed the Historian . " On that point , " interposed the Senator , " I think I must express a different opinion . Public policies are written in party platforms . " " That is not clear to me , " added the Representative . " Party platforms are statements of ends to be attained . Practical policies , which are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as contingencies arise in the midst of changing circumstances . It is impossible to formulate definite policies , to be carried out regardless of conditions . " " It has been my lot , " observed the Historian , " to study minutely public policies in their formation , development , and execution in many different countries during long periods of time . In the light of these studies , I think it best to avoid all dogmatic statements on this subject . Every separate country seems to have its own peculiar needs , determined by its extent , its natural resources , its environment , the qualities of its population , and many other fixed conditions . From these it is possible to deduce certain lines of action so evidently advantageous that there need be no debate regarding them . These elements of public policy result from a general consensus of expert opinion , and are of a demonstrable nature . There are , always , however , certain open questions which are legitimate subjects of controversy . These last are the only aspects of public policy with which party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fact , party questions , and should not be regarded as matters of party politics . " " How do you apply the results of this analysis to foreign policy ? " demanded the Senator . " To illustrate my meaning , " continued the Historian , " such objects as the defense of the country , the protection of the life and property of American citizens abroad , the extension of foreign commerce , the avoidance of international misunderstandings , the execution of treaty rights , and the prevention of encroachments upon our sphere of influence by other Powers , belong to the first class of duties . These can not well be made the subject of party politics . The whole country ought to support the Executive in performing them . The mechanism ' ? if I may use the expression ? by means of which these duties are to he performed should have nothing partisan about it . It consists of the army , the navy , and the diplomatic and consular services .

" inquired the Senator . " They must of necessity be left to the wisdom of the party in power , which will then be held responsible for results , " was the reply . " I see , " exclaimed the Editor . " The mechanism , ' as you call it ? that is , the army , the navy , and the foreign services ? should be built up on lines of technical efficiency for the work they have to do . The ' administration ' ? that is , the party in power ? should then assume responsibility for the direction of this ' mechanism ' in the accomplishment of the universally recognized objects for which it exists ? " " That is it , precisely , " replied the Historian . " The ' mechanism ' belongs to the nation , the direction of it to the party the people have placed in power .

" A general laugh greeted this sally , as the guests all arose from the table . " Well , gentlemen , " said the Judge , " I am sorry we must separate . We seem to have just reached the interesting point in the conversation . We have raised more questions than we have settled ; but , assuming that our foreign service really means anything to the country , we ought to settle them . I wish some one would tell us just what we ought to do about it . Wo n't you all come and dine with me on Saturday evening ? "              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
