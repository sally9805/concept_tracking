txt A. German , calling himself Werner Van Horn , attempted to destroy the Canadian ' Pa- ? cific Railroad bridge here over the St. Croix River to New Brunswick soon after 1 o'clock this morning by exploding a heavy charge of dynamite or nitroglycerin under one span on the Canadian side . His effort was a failure , as the structure was little damaged , but by escaping back into Maine , where he was arrested a few hours later at a local hotel , he managed to thrust another international problem upon the United States Government . As an alleged German reservist with the rank of Captain , Van Horn insists that he has committed an act of war . or a political offense , and having fled to a neutral country can not be legally surrendered to an enemy of the Fatherland . Van Horn has been formally arrested on a warrant sworn out by the Canadian Pacific Railway Company and is held by order of the Attorney General of Maine for a hearing , the time of which depends upon the action of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's extradition .

He returned early in January to New York , where he tried to get a ship to Germany , with the intention of rejoining the army . He was unable to leave the country , however , and then conceived that he might help the German cause by blowing up some of the bridges on the Canadian Pacific , which hasbeen carrying large quantities I of supplies and munitions from upper , Canada and the West across Maine tol St. John , N. 13. , the Winter port of Canada . He says that " arrangements " were made in New York , with persons he deClines to name , for him to conic to , Maine and destroy the bridge at Vance-I boro .

" I met an Irishman there on the railroad embankment , " said Van Horn , " and he handed me a package and at once disappeared . I know nothing further of him . " Van Horn suspended the package from the inside of an end post of the bridge and between 1 and 2 this morning discharged the explosive . The noise was terrific and shook the glass out of windows in the villages on either side of the border . Cold Prevented Escape . Van Horn had planned to take flight to Lambert Lake , . - ors. ' which point he intended to drive about thirty miles to Princeton . The night was intensely cold , and he suffered so much from exposure that lid was unable to carry out this purpose , and so he returned to the hotel .

From tile coat pocket Deputy Ross took a loaded army revolver , several railroad maps and a little German flag . Van Horn explained that he would not have made any move to get his weapon , had he known the officers were Americans . He supposed they were Canadians and said that in that case lie would have defended himself . He admitted blowing up the bridge and inslated .. that his act was justified as an act of ' war . he'walked to the lockup he waved " to the bystanders the little German flag which had been restored to him .
