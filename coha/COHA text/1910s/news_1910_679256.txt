txt Ballinger Blames Agitation for Keeping the Question Unsettled and for Congress 's Inaction , BASED ON FALSE STATEMENTS Wants Early Prosecution of Pending Cases and Congressional Action as to How the Coal May Be Acquired . WASHINGTON , Nov. ** Ballinger blames the agitation which has been raised throughout the country since the withdrawal of all Alaskan coal lands in 1906 as the cause of keeping the whole I question unsettled and also for the inaa- : tion of Congress in a lengthy statement in the form of , an interview which he makes public to-night . Therein he assaijs those who have charged him with being an opponent of conservation . The statement was brought out by the recent indictments in Washington against Alaska coal claimants , in which connection the Secretary says that these " are but ' further steps in the effort which is being made by the Government to clear up and settle this whole question . " Since the withdrawal order was made to enable Congress to decide upon a definite policy of dealing with this resource , the Secretary says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alaska coal ? an agitation largely based on false statements . Whatever has been the . motive behind the agitation , it has resulted in keeping the whole question unsettled and is largely blamable for the inaction of Congress . " The Secretary points that there are two essentials for clearing up the situation , as follows : " ( 1 ) An early prosecution and disposition of the pending cases . involving charges of . fraud and conspiracy against existing claimants , and " , ( 2 ) Congressional action definitely deciding the manner in which Alaskan coal may be acquired . " As the Pacific Coast is obliged to draw its goods from the Atlantic Coast , the Secretary snys , the charge has arisen that the ' interests " are the beneficiaries of the policy which prevents the opening up . of large fuel deposits . " There has been much talk , " Secretary Ballinger continues , " of the Interests opposing that so-called conservation , which makes for reservation rather than use , but as a matter of fact the ' interests ' naturally favor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Secretary points out that Mexican coal can be delivered at San Francisco for $4 a ton , while a railroad in Alaska is compelled to pay $12 a ton . " To my mind a continuation of the present situation is the direct antithesis of railroad conservation , " the Secretary says . " Consider that for each five tons of Atlantic seaboard coal transpdrted to the Pacific Coast one ton is used up in transportation , or a total waste of 20 per cent. , and you will see that existing methods do not conserve but destroy . " From an economic point of view , it Is intolerable that this waste should continue . and that a large region should be handicapped in its legitimate development , and the proper use of its resources by the failure of the Government properly to settle the problems of how to use these resources . " It is most sincerely to be hoped that Congress will determine early in the coming session the manner in which Alaska coal may be taken out and placed in the markets of the Pacific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
