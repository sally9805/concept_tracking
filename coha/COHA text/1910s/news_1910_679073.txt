txt CHURCHES ' UNEARNED INCREMENT , The real estate news contains the statement that a leading church has resolved to sell its property for $660,000 . It has owned the site since 1885 , and the exemption from taxes for a generation is a fortune in itself . To this must be added the " unearned increment , " which doubly deserves the name in the case of any institution which contributes nothing to the city 's income or commercial prosperity . It is not intended to suggest that churches do not render a social service perhaps equivalent to their tax exemption , but how about their getting rich at the same time , and cashing in their profits without accounting for any portion to anybody ? The case is illustrative of the Mayor 's suggestion the other day that many tax exemptions were unjustified , and particularly the exemption of churches . Tax Commissioner PURDY reinforced the suggestion by cases within his knowledge of abuse of the sacred privilege . In one case a commercial undertaking is carried on for profitswhich are-increased by the amount of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxes on unimproved property since 1892 on the declaration of immediate intention to build . No one wishes to be penurious in dealing with this class of taxation , but at a time when the tax burden . is increasingly and oppressively felt it is necessary to consider that the city exempts $305,000.000 of property from taxation , including $103.000,000 of church prop-arty . This exemption is by constitutional privilege , and is almost impregnable . Public opinion would not support a direct attack . But there is a middle ground . When churches elect to cash their unearned increment ought they not to pay up their taxes ? If a church seeks ' exemption in return for its social servicerdu lieu of taxes , eught it not to render the service ? That is to say . ought not exemption to be strictly limited to a church which is performing churchly functions , and not extended to a church which intends to be a church , or to a church which is making a commercial profit while others are bearing the church 's burden ? It would seem 8.8 though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms that dissent would be . silenced for shame , and thus burdens which are pressing hard upon the community be lightened .
