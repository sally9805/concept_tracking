Francis R. Arnold , head of the wholesale perfumery house of F. . R. Arnold &; Co. of 7 West Twenty-second Street . believes that his daughter has met with foul play . The police , however , lean to the theory that the young womarr is still alive , and are sparing no effort to find her . Garvan &; Armstrong of 40 Wall Street . the lawyers representing the Arnold family , announced thaZ Mr. Arnold had authorized them to offer a reward of $1,000 for information leading  - -  to the discovery of Miss Arnold : Circulars giving notice of the reward and bearing photographs and a description of the missing girl will be printed ' to-day , and copies sent to the police ' of every town and city in this country , Canada . and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe . This Clue Interests Lawyers : A young girl answering in many respects the description of Miss Arnold but accompanied by a man was seen on the Pennsylvania Railroad rerryboat which left the Cortlandt Street slip at 10:30 o'clock yesterday morning for Jersey City . The passenger whose attention was attracted to the pair at once communicated with Mr. Armstrong , who met him at 4 o'clock at the Hotel Cadillac in Times Square and heard his story with some interest . The man who gave the information did not wish his name used and asked Mr. Armstrong not to give it to the newspapers , but his account so impressed Mr. Armstrong that he immediately called up Mr. Garvane his partner , on the telephone , telling him , it is said , that he had just received the best clue they had had since the baffling search began . It is also learned that Mr. Armstrong urged Mr. Garvan to have Philadelphia hotels and boarding houses searched last night by every detective ' and agent who could be pressed into service , and that Mr. Garvan at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story which Mr. Armstrong 's informant tells regarding the couple he saw on the ferryboat : " I got ' to ' the Cortlandt Street Ferry landing a few minutes before 10:20 o'clock when the boat ' was to leave for Jersey City . Going to the upper deck , I sat down about amidships . In a rew minutes my attention was attracted by the excited talking of a couple who sat about four feet ' from me . They were conversing chiefly in German , with - here and there a word in English . " The girl was dressed in clothes of excellent material . She wore a tailor-made suit of black broadcloth , a black hat , trimmed with black ostrich feathers , white shirtwiast with small blue tie , black suede shoes , and black muff , the fur of which was very longs Her hair was brown , of too dark a shade to be blonde . She appeared to be about 5 feet 5 inches tall and to weigh about 140 pounds .

Sometimes I could see'her full face , particularly when she , in her nervousness and anxiety to discuss whatever they were talking about , leaned far over and turned herself as squarely as possible to face her companion . The full face photographs I have seen of Miss Arnold did not resemble the girl so much , as well as 1 can recall , below the eyes , but in the upper part of the face I should say the likeness was almost perfect . " The man with her was apparently 5 feet 11 inches tall . He was smooth shaven , quite dark of complexion , with every evidence of a heavy black beard it allowed to grow . He weighed , I should say , about 145 to 150 pounds . He was about 30 years old . The only article of his clothing which I recalled was a short . black overcoat . I was not- for Miss Arnolds .

" The man Dd not have the appearance of the refinement which I associated with the girl . He did not seem to be dressed as expensively as she , nor did he seem to carry or conduct himself with the ease which was an outstanding charateristic of the girl . He seemed to be in a lower social scale than the girl . " I speak and understand German . I heard the girl say distinctly , most anxiously , and- in excellent German : " ' Where are we going to go ? ' " To this the man replied in calmer fashion : " ' Philadelphia . We have been here long enough . ' After that I could not distinguish enough words connectedly to make sense . Once I heard the man say , ' Hotel Aldine . ' " There is a hotel of that : lame in Philadelphia , but the police of that city could find no trace last night of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Missing Forty-six Days . It is forty-six days since Miss Arnold was last seen by any member of her family , and in that time a search , that while conducted secretly , was at the same time as thorough and far-reaching as the best detectives that could be employed could make It , has been going on night and day . Every vessel that carries wireless has been communicated with , and every hospital and hotel in this part of the country has been searched in gain . Commissioner Flynn was appealed to by Mr. Arnold on the Thursday before Christmas and he immediately assigned half a dozen of his best men to the case . He also called into his service two women detectives . Commissioner Flynn said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  romance , Black Hand , kidnapping . foul play , and abduction , but thus far without success . John S. Keith of Garvan Armstrong , who is an old friend of the Arnold Pam ' ily , told yesterday of the ceaseless search that has been going on . " Miss Arnold and her mother , " said Mr. Keith , " were like sisters . Never have I seen a mother and sister more de ; voted to each other . If Dorothy saw that she tVould be late in reaching home , even from an afternoon bridge whist , she would always telephone her mother before starting for home , and in that way allay her mother 's anxiety . I remember , in particular , a certain evening when she left the home of a protesting friend in order to keep her promise to her mother to be home by 10 o'clock , and it Is unthinkable now that she could keep her mother in suspense for weeks , if it were possible for her to get into communication with her . For this reason I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will make her whereabouts known even if she is alive now . " When it became certain that Miss Arnold was gone , suspicion fell on a certain young man . He and Miss ' Arnold had been on friendly terms at one period . I am able to state positively , however , that the young man in question established a satisfactory All of her men friends and her girl chums were questioned , but they were , like the rest of us , utterly unable to account for her going away . " Miss Arnold has been abroad often , but so far as is known she had no relatives or close friends in Europe . " There were many rumors yesterday , one of them traced to a pawnbroker in West Street , who told of a young woman coming into his place on Wednesday and trying to purchase a pair of men 's trousers . The representatives of the Arnolds took no stock in that story . Another story was that she had recently been seen en Fifth Avenue , but there was no accompanying circumstances to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arnold said yesterday he could offer no explanation of the reason of his daughter 's disappearance .
