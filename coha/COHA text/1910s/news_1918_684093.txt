txt THE VOICE OF THE PEOPLE . Why Mr. Anderson Believes It Is Beat Heard Without a Vote . To the Editor of The New York Times : William Barnes , in a letter to THE TimEs , quotes the plank upon the prohibition question which he offered in the Resolutions Committee at the recent unofficial Republican State Convention . In declaring for a referendum on the Federal Amendment , Mr. Barnes took exactly the position taken by Tammany . The men whom he lists as voting for it are all politically " wet , " and at least one of them directly ' connected with the brewing interests . The proposal for a State-wide vote upon ratification of the Prohibition Amendment was an attempt to rob the people of all sections of the State of a voice upon this question . Tammany undoubtedly believes that if a vote can be had in the State as a whole it will be possible by the usual Tammany methods , weapons , and ammunition to roll up a wet majority in New York City that will over*belm the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intended for the people of the State to vote en bloc , they would have so provided , but in the wisdom which has preserved the country from so many perils they balanced the handicap involved in the reauirement of a twothirds vote in both houses of Congress and ratification by three-fourths of the States , with a proviso giving every part of the State and every class of its citizenship a chance to be heard and counted upon the amendment question , so that in a strictly rural State the farming population could not completely overwhelm any cities the State might have , and , on the other hand , an overshadowing city could not stifle the voice of the rural element . The present plan is a part of the " American system , " and it comes with 00r grace for Mr. Barnes . a self-appointed defender of the Constitution , to attempt to go counter to its spirit merely.because the liquor traffic is involved .
