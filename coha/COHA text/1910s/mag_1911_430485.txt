 | GREAT issues usually boil themselves down to a single word . It is the final essence of years of labored review and pamphlet writing , of windy debate , stump speaking , newspaper wrangling . As ideas become clearer , convictions more crystallized , expression simplifies ? until finally all is said in one little grouping of letters . " Aristocrat " was in the end all the French Revolutionists needed to express themselves . The word rose to so awful a power that to hiss it at a passerby was enough to put a mob at his heels , to land him in the Conciergerie , possibly on the guillotine . Mr. Lincoln sensed rarely the power in a word . He had felt it . Nothing had been more difficult for him to handle in his campaigning in the ' 50 's than the word " abolitionist . " In the war he was forever seeking to use the unarmed word . " Say Confederates " was his gentle rebuke to a young surgeon who , showing him through a hospital , said of certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own troubled time is creating its allpowerful words . One new term is already upon us , too young to have found its way into our dictionaries , yet to be seen on every editorial page , to be heard in every conversation . It is the word which we use to describe the attitude of the mind , the to-beexpected course of action , the philosophy of life and politics of a vast and powerful American group ? the word stand-pat . Crumbs from the Poker Table At the poker table , where the term began life , the stand-patter , so one of our chief card experts , Mr. R. F. Foster , tells me , is " one who does not want to show his hand , does not want any assistance , and does not want to add or deduct anything from his position . " " In politics , " Mr. Foster adds , " it seems to have the latter application . The hand may be already disclosed in a measure , but the politician declines to make any attempt to improve his position ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out with what he has . This standing pat represents the rejection of all offers of compromise , and denies any fear of the result . At the same time it is suggestive that the stand-patter may have more up his sleeve than you give him credit for . It may also be a bluff , to give the other side the impression that the stand-patter is stronger than he really is . " So much , then , a direct appeal to the word 's origin gives us . But go study the standpatter at his favorite occupation of cementing and extending the walls of the protective tariff , the business which developed him : your first surprise will be that , satisfied as he apparently may be with his hand , unwilling as he may apparently be to add to it , he as a matter of fact long ago departed from the methods of the gentleman whose name he bears . The " hand " of the tariff stand-patter may be said to be the formula of protection .  | Now , this formula as it is and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the country is not especially intricate or confusing . Whether one approves of it or not , it must be admitted that it was worked out plausibly enough . Put yourself back a hundred years or so , when the country was busy with agriculture and commerce and mining . We had an enormous advantage in these pursuits . We were at a disadvantage in manufacturing . To be sure , from the start we did a little . In the nature of things we would gradually do more , and what we did would be on a solid basis . But , obviously , only the born ironmaster , potter , weaver , was going to practise his trade in the new country with the foreigner importing goods cheaper than he as a rule could make them . And so we decided to encourage manufacturing by taxing ourselves . The amount of the tax decided on was to be only enough to put our would-be manufacturers on an even basis with the foreigner . This meant what ? By general consent , it meant giving our people enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Americans were not going to work for the same wages that Europeans did . There were too many ways in which they could earn more . The country was new , and men could have land of their own on easy terms . Commerce called them ; for , having land , we were raising foods , and Europe and the Orient , worn and old and privilege-ridden , were crying for food . They could make everything we wanted , cheap as dirt . They were eager to exchange . If we were to do our own manufacturing , we were obliged to devise a scheme which would make the wages of operatives approximately equal to those which could be earned in our natural occupations . Thus protection was not adopted for the sake of producing generous wages for labor . It was adopted because the rewards to labor in the new country were already generous and promised to be more so . There is another equally important point to remember , and that is that it was expressly understood that the duty was never to be prohibitive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at home to compete with the man from abroad ; no more . Sensible people have always agreed that we would injure ourselves if we allowed prohibitive duties , since they would cut us off from the stimulus of competition and also from models . The old countries had been for centuries making the goods we wanted . They knew how to do it . We needed constantly before us in our markets the educational effect of their work . What Shall It Profit Us If We Tax Ourselves ? There were few , if any , at the start to deny that this taxing of ourselves to establish industries was dangerous business , undemocratic , of course , and an obvious bait to the greedy , but they comforted themselves with the gains which they believed would speedily result . The list was tempting : 1 . We were to build up industries which would supply our own needs . 2 . The laborers attracted into these industries were to make a larger home market . 3 . We were soon to out-rival the foreigner in cost of production , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ borne cheaper goods than ever the Old World could give . 4 . We were to outstrip the Old World in quality and variety ? another reward for taxation patiently borne . 5 . We were to ' over-produce and with our surplus win the markets of the world . Nobody pretended to deny that if it was found on fair experiment that these results were impossible in a particular industry the protection must be withdrawn . Otherwise it amounted to supporting an industry at public expense ? an unbusinesslike , unfair , and certainly undemocratic performance . Here , then , is the stand-patter 's hand ? theoretically . But the formula , as one picks it out to-day from his explanations and his practices , is only a battered wreck of its old self ? formless , purposeless and patched almost beyond recognition . For instance , how does he treat the promises to give us goods as cheap and equal in quality to those to be had abroad ? For the last twelve years we have been harassed by an intolerable fact , that we were getting less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? less not only in quantity but also in quality . If we had all been able to get enough money to balance the loss in what money would buy , there would have been no problem ; but only the powerful few were doing that ? those who were " on the inside , " those who were indispensable to the machine , those who were soldered into masses so powerful that they must be kept satisfied . This , the most threatening and grotesque fact of our times , has become the problem of our times . We call it the problem of the  | cost of living . It has many causes , but the fact that in many industries the protective tax has not worked out as it was expected to do , and given us goods as cheap and of as high a quality as we could buy from the foreigner , is certainly one cause . When a correspondent on the border of Texas writes me that he can buy sugar of the same grade and make two cents cheaper a few miles away in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price can only be explained by the tariff on sugar . When I can buy a pair of hose in London for i8 cents which cost me 35 cents in New York , a pair of gloves there for 72 cents which cost $1.50 here , a raincoat there for $11 which costs me $25 here , I conclude that the duty of one cent on the cotton , of 8 1/2 cents on the hose , of 33 1/3 on the gloves , and of $9 on the coat have something to do with the higher cost here . That is , I conclude that in certain cases the formula has not worked out in spite of scores of years of trial . When a Fact is Not a Fact Now , how does the stand-pat intellect meet this fact ? A few months ago Mr. William Whitman , of Boston , the great worsted and woolen manufacturer , one of the most perfect types of stand-pattism in the country , was called as a witness before a committee investigating the troublesome matter of the cost of living . Questioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem ! He dismissed it as " alleged " ! According to Mr. Whitman , the fact that the newspapers and magazines say that the cost of living is excessive causes people to believe it to be so , " and so to stop buying . " Questioned as to the bearing of the tariff on the price of woolen goods , Mr. Whitman declared that it did not affect it . It is the irony of fate that his principal political partner , Mr. William Wood , the head of the American Woolen Company , should have been the one recently to demonstrate what the tariff does do for woolens . Mr. Wood was trying to show the Massachusetts voters how low the tariff on his product really is by telling them how large an amount we imported last year . " Why , think of it ! " said he in substance . " Last year we imported goods worth on the other side nearly twentyfour million dollars . By the time they had paid the duty these goods were worth not far from the actual value of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Foss was quick-witted enough to show what this really meant . " The output of the American Woolen Company last year , " said Governor Foss , " was about forty-eight million dollars . That is , according to Mr. Wood himself , we paid forty-eight millions for goods worth on the other side just about half that money ! " And yet Mr. Whitman , stand-patter , tells us the tariff has nothing to do with the cost of woolens . But this is hardly more peculiar than some of the reasoning which came to us last year from one of our most accomplished stand-pat Senators , Henry Cabot Lodge . Mr. Lodge was chairman of a Senate committee investigating the cost of living . He did not go quite as far as Mr. Whitman ? that is , he did not dismiss the subject by declaring it merely a newspaper yarn . But he did find that " the tariff was no material factor . " His chief reason for this conclusion amounted to this : The increased cost of living is world-wide . There are several causes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is much like saying that because a log jam is made up of several logs no one log has anything to do with the jam . Another curious bit of reasoning in Mr. Lodge 's report was this : He had offered a list of 257 articles ? almost all of them protected to some extent ? the prices of which he had shown to have increased between 1900 and 1909 by 14.5 per cent . Out of this list Mr. Lodge selected fourteen articles on which the duty was highest . He found that the average increase on these fourteen articles was only 13.1 per cent . Therefore , he concluded the tariff is no material factor in the increased cost of living ! Still another reason for exonerating the tariff from any guilt in the matter was this : The increase of cost in all kinds of farm products between 1900 ? 1909 has been much greater than the increase of manufactured products . Now , says Mr. Lodge , there has been practically no change in the tariffs on farm products in this period , therefore the tariff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another part of Mr. Lodge 's report I find several tables sent in by farmers showing how the prices they are paying now for farmer implements compare with those they paid 10 years ago , and here are some of them : Binders which in 1900 cost $110.00 in Abingdon , Ill. , cost now $120.00 ; mowers have increased in this period from $40.00 to $45.00 ; two-horse wagons from $50.00 to $65.00 ; plows from $50.00 to $56.00 ; harness from $30.00 to $40.00 . And there are similar reports from other States . Now ,  | with these figures in mind , read the following testimony which appeared in the Congressional Record during the tariff debate of two years ago . It was given by a former salesman of the International Harvester Trust . " During my trips to Europe , " this man said , " I sold to European dealers harvesting machines f. o. b. at Chicago as follows : Binders $33.00 ; mowers $12.00 ; hay rakes $5.00 ; and reapers $15.00 less than they are sold to American dealers , besides selling the European @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than domestic types , in order to handle the heavy crops raised over there and compete with the substantially built European machine . Here the trust is free from any such competition , as our tariff imposes a prohibitive duty on machinery . " Does anyone for a moment doubt ? does even Mr. Lodge doubt ? that if the tariff was taken from these farmer 's implements he would not soon be able to buy them at a price at least approximately as low as the trust sells them for in Europe ? And what is true of his farm implements is true of many other things . It is true of his tinware , for example . To-day the farmer pays at retail nearly if not quite twice as much for the same quality of tin as he paid 20 years ago . Does anyone doubt that if the duty were taken " from tin plate he would not get his ware cheaper ? Does any doubt , either , that if the farmer has the advantage of lower prices for everything , practically , that he must buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That farming would not be less expensive work , that there would not be more farmers , greater product , and the profits increased in the true way by larger quantities at prices within the reach of all , instead of the false contemporary way of a limited product at prices which only the well-to-do can meet ? " No Child of Mine " It is not alone the failure of protection to make many necessary articles cheap that the stand-patter evades or denies . He is equally conscienceless in his attitude toward another disquieting phenomenon , and that is the trusts in protected industries . Frequently he has so little knowledge of his own " hand " that he will insist that the trust is an industrial surprise ? a species of unexpected highwaymen of whose presence on the road he had no warning and for whose ravages he consequently can not be held accountable . If he knew his own formula , or , knowing , was willing to regard it , he would be ashamed of this sort of pleading . No evil concealed in the doctrine of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every stage , since Hamilton 's time , we have been warned that it waited us just around the turn . For the last twenty-five years , especially , we have seen it pour down upon us , an army whose ranks yearly grew thicker , stronger and more cruel . This is the very army for which we had been cautioned repeatedly for decades to be in ambush . There was a counter force provided , of course , for this waiting enemy ? domestic competition . Now , we know what has happened to domestic competition in the last thirty years in this country . Freed from foreign competition ? something which the doctrine never intended should happen ? the home manufacturers have by a succession of guerilla campaigns , often as ruthless and lawless as those of wild Indians or Spanish freebooters , corralled industry after industry so completely that they could control its output and at once cheapen the quality and increase the price of the product . Anyone who wants to know more than he already does of the power and extent of industrial monopolies in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presented to Congress last December . Its virility and authority was the one hopeful feature in the generally apathetic stand-pat attitude of the administration at that time . And , reading this report , consider the relations to the vicious combinations Mr. Wickersham is prosecuting of the protection so many of them enjoy . Take away the protection of the window-glass trust , and does anyone believe its high-handedness would not be gradually checked ? If the tobacco trust and sugar trust and paper trust and powder trust and beef trust , all of which Mr. Wickersham is attacking for extortions and brigandage , had to meet world competition , does anybody doubt that they would not find many of their present methods impractical ? Protection is so obvious an aid to them that it seems like insisting that two and two make four even to refer to it . But put this up to a stand-patter who knows his formula , and what do you get ? Why , the answer that protection was never intended to foster trusts , and therefore it can not be that it is doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for domestic competition , and , since it provides for it , his idea seems to be we must have it !  | Whatever is in the formula is in practice ! It is no backwood 's member from a remote Pennsylvania iron-and-steel district who asserts this . It is the ablest man of then all ? Senator Aldrich himself . " I can not conceive of such a thing as a monopoly under protection " was the substance of Senator Aldrich 's argument on the point in the last tariff debate . The lay stand-patters all follow him in this repudiation . " Trusts were formed to keep prices down and save the waste of competition , " declared an excited defender of protection , at a recent public dinner in New York . " If you find a crooked trust , you will find that it was not created by the tariff , but by the crooked railroad officials . The tariff was made that the industries of our own country should thrive . " It ca n't be so because it was not intended that it should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that monopoly can not exist under protection will under stress argue : Take no duty from those who have formed trusts , but give it to us who have not . " In order that you may ? " one feels like asking . This was a link in the argument of the gentlemen who pleaded in 1909 that Schedules I and K ( cotton and wool ) should remain undisturbed . There is no " cotton trust , " therefore continue duties long unnecessary and wink at those which trickery forces through ! True , there is no cotton trust ? as yet . But how are trusts bred ? Does our experience show us a more fruitful father of them than cutting off foreign competition , as the new duties on the higher grade of cottons seem to have done ? How are trusts bred ? Is there anyone left who - does not know that when such privileges as prohibitive tariffs are dangled before men 's eyes they rush to seize them , build and build again , regardless of all laws of trade ? Is there anyone left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in half-time and shut-downs as truly as a man 's intemperance pays one in physical and mental exhaustion ? And in the period of depression the new and weak fall into the hands of the rich and long-established . This has been the history of many a cotton factory . Why should it not all end as it has in scores of other industries ? But there are other breeders of trusts . What else are the supposed agreements as to output and prices of which rumors come from the great cotton organization , the Arkwright Club ? What else was the attempt of that club in 1909 to unite with European cotton manufacturers to restrict the consumption of cotton in order to lower its price . But should we expect that in an industry which boasts so many men of great ability , daring and ambition as cotton manufacturing , and in which the rewards are so tremendous , no man will ever be found strong enough to take advantage of the tendencies to combination which already show themselves and to work out a trust ? Why should there not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as in oil or steel ? The woolen industry , like cotton , pleads to be allowed to retain its high protection because it is still unshackled by combination . That is partially but not entirely true . As a matter of fact , there does exist a strong combination in this industry ? the American Woolen Company , which has earned the popular title of " woolen trust " largely because of its trust-like methods . The woolen trust is far from being a monopoly , though it is certainly a good nucleus for one . It already controls about one-third of our domestic production of woolens and worsteds for men 's wear . Its annual product is about $48,000,000 . Its capital is$69,000 , - 000 . All things considered , there seems to be no reason why eventually the American Woolen Company , if it finds a Rockefeller or a Carnegie , which it certainly has not done yet , should not follow in the steps of steel and sugar and oil and turpentine and bath tubs. ' juggling With Figures When the stand-patter refuses to see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the trusts , he has this to support him : There are other causes . The degree to which the tariff is responsible for these menaces is debatable . It is in the use he makes of statistics that his utter inability to accept what is so because it is so is best shown . For instance , what does the stand-patter say to the fact that we are consuming less wool per person than we once did ? He denies it ! Mr. Theodore Justice , when confronted in 1900 with the statement of the Director of the Census that a decrease was going on , contradicted him . Instead of our having consumed but 420,000,000 pounds , as Mr. North declared , we had consumed 600,000,000 , Mr. Justice said . When Mr. North pressed him to give the basis of his calculations , he said he had " guessed " it from the amounts of wool his friends and customers were using ! It was a " good , generous guess , " as Mr. North said . Mr. Justice  | has gone on guessing ever since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pages of his amazing calculations in every set of tariff hearings it puts out ! Another answer of the stand-patter to the complaint that our wool consumption is falling off is that we consume more than any other nation . But the real essence of this is that what we consume does not go to the people who need it . Thanks to the tariff almost alone , pure wool is made into blankets and clothes too costly for those who are exposed most to cold and wet . Who gets it ? It is not an unusual thing in this country to-day to find families owning a town house , a country house for mid-seasons , a mountain camp , and a yacht . In such a domestic plant there will be at least fifty bedrooms , everyone of them furnished with at least one pair of blankets . There will not be a pair , even in the camp , which costs less than $20.00 . The double blankets of American make will cost at least $27.00 , the same of Austrian make at least $35.00 . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with these costly blankets which are probably never in use for more than a few weeks in the year . And living within a stone 's throw of them are tens of thousands of families who never had and never will have a woolen blanket to cover even the baby . This is not the fault of those who are surfeited with blankets . It is the fault of our ineffective bungling management of property and production . Everything which interferes with economic laws is responsible for it . The tariff is but one cause ? but it is one , and the one we happen at this moment to be concerned with . The stand-patter has another characteristic way of treating facts which contradict his notion of protection ? it is to change the subject . Call his attention to the inequalities of the duties on raw wool and he will tell you of the difference in the labor cost of dress goods here and in England . Tell him the quality of our goods is deteriorating and he will draw you a picture of the blessings of the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blankets and woolen garments from the sufferers from tuberculosis , who certainly need them , and he will tell you that " the American people are better clothed than any other people in the world and their clothes are better made . " In a recent article in this magazine I pointed out the two fundamental errors of the present wool schedule . The article has been repeatedly attacked by those who do not wish to see these injustices removed . The critics make no attempt to prove the duties right . Their favorite answer is to show how much lower wages are in Europe than America ? something which I had not touched on and which I do not dispute . But if wages were tenfold as great in this country as in Europe , that would not make these absurd duties any less absurd ? that would not change the fact that as long as they exist our laboring people are going to wear cotton instead of wool . Anyone who has observed the life of the workingman on both sides of the Atlantic , knows that wages , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the United States . It is a New World , with a New World 's hopes . But it is only the blind and deaf who do not realize that the same forces of allied greed and privilege which have made life so hard for so many in the Old World are at work , frenziedly seeking to repeat here what they have done there . The problem of our day is to defeat this sinister purpose , to preserve the hopes of our New World . Denying that there are wrongs , refusing to see misery , chanting forever the false refrain of " everything for the best in the best possible of worlds , " is the flimsy trick of those who would divert attention from burdens it is our duty to ease . The Stand-Patter at Bay Juggling the formula under which he pretends to work , denying facts or shying from them , this is your typical stand-patter . Press your attack on his position , however , and you will find something more than negation . You will find an angry , alert opponent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to attack your position if you do not let him alone . This is the meaning of the recent sudden concern certain woolen men have shown about the second-class mail discriminations . Finding that they were not stopping the outcry against Schedule K , they are trying what retaliation will do . Mr. William Whitman led off by announcing the rather startling theory that the " alleged " increase in the cost of living was due to the second-class mail . " I believe it to be absolutely true , " he said , " that the entire cost of publishing and distributing the newspapers of the United States and the magazines ' is one of the great contributory causes to the cost of merchandise and is borne by the consumer . " Other defenders of Schedule K have followed Mr. Whitman in calling attention to  | the fact that the periodicals which are criticizing the wool tariff as unfair are not paying the Government as much as they ought for distribution . This is probably true . Personally , I believe that every newspaper , pamphlet , and periodical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or takes money for advertisements should pay to the Government all that the carriage and distribution costs . But this means that the post-office department should find out what it does cost and apportionate it among all second-class mail ? not discriminate against one division of that mail . It means also that the department should be conducted on sound business principles ? taken out of politics and run economically and efficiently . The chief trouble with the present second-class mail agitation is that it has been vindictive . It has been less inspired by a serious desire to solve fairly and for all time the long-standing problem than by a malicious desire to throttle the magazine . The activity of the wool men is actuated purely and simply by their desire to strike back , and perhaps a hope that if they keep up the attack they may silence their critics . It is an appeal to cupidity , a warning that you too shall suffer if they must , and it carries with it a corollary fatal to public honesty ? Let us alone and we will let you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no new method in stand-pat circles . They have long been Mr. Aldrich 's most effective weapon . They are the very essence of the power the unholy wool alliance has had for so many decades , as Mr. Aldrich more than once admitted in the making of the tariff of 1909 . Listen to him : " I say to the Senator that this wool and woolen schedule is the crucial schedule in this bill . . . . if by insidious or any other means he can induce the Senate to break down this schedule , that is the end of protection , for the present anyway , in this country . " And again : " There is no Senator sitting upon this side of the Chamber , there is no person who is acquainted with the tariffs of this or any other country , who does not know that an assault upon the wool and woolen schedule of this bill is an attack upon the very citadel of protection and the lines of defense for American industries and American labor . If the Senate destroys the relation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demoralize the whole protective system : and you destroy every line of defense which the people of this country have who believe in the protective policy . " We all know now , or should know , that Mr. Aldrich was not defending the wool duties because they are fair , because they faithfully live up to the doctrine of which he speaks so reverently . He was defending them because they have back of them the solidest vote in the Senate ? a vote made solid solely by the sure political support the voters know they will have if they stand pat on the iniquities . Those to whom he talked knew it , and they knew that he was warning them that if they did not support these duties they could not expect to get what they wanted , however just from the protectionist standpoint that might be . Moreover , Mr. Aldrich has realized for years that the only method by which he could wrest high duties from Congress was by threats such as are contained in the above paragraphs . He virtually confessed this as far back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wool combine , who was treated by the Senate Finance Committee as a confidential adviser on wool : " I do n't suppose this tariff is going to last long because the rates are so high , but I am perfectly willing that the wool manufacturers should have all that there is in it , and that the tail should go with the hide . " They certainly got " all there was in it " ? in 1897 ? they got it again in 1909 and in both cases " the tail went with the hide . " In the meantime , thanks to Mr. Aldrich 's policy , the shirts of the workingmen of the country have grown thinner and thinner , the cloak of the working girl has become two thirds or three fourths cotton , the stockings of the errand boy have ceased to be a protection and the baby must be kept warm with cotton puffs . Thanks to Mr. Aldrich , too , those who have had the benefits he granted so cynically have grown more and more insolent , confident and greedy in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his tutelage they have even come to claim that the taxes which protect them are not grants but rights ? rights as sacred as private property ? that they are private property ? Listen to Mr. William Whitman . He is writing to the National Clothiers ' Association , which several times in the last two years has protested against the quality of the goods the American manufacturers were giving them . " The makers of clothing , " writes Mr. Whit-  | man , " have no legitimate right to demand that the duties on cloth should be reduced to a point that would injure the wool manufacture . " ( All the clothier had asked was removing the discrimination from the schedule . ) " Moreover , " he went on , " the public at large has no right to demand that the duties on manufactures of wool and of clothing on my business and on yours shall be so reduced as to favor foreign producers . The general public has no right to demand that those engaged in the whole woolen industry ? only a partially protected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? have a special mission to furnish cheap clothing without reasonable and proper profit to themselves . " Mr. Whitman has come to believe that the general public exists for the benefit of the woolen industry . He is in error . The woolen business exists for the benefit of the public . Cheap , good clothing is a necessity , and the public has a right to demand whatever changes in the tariff , whatever regulations and restrictions will give it to them . The interest of 92,000,000 people is of more importance than the interest of even so large and important a group as the wool growers , the manufacturers and the clothiers . The intelligent and thoughtful in these industries know this . They know , too , that they can build up a solid , respectable business only by regarding first the interest of the public . Playing on Prejudice There has always been a fraction of Mr. Aldrich 's party in the Senate that could not be moved by threats ? who if they had known enough about the tariff on which they were voting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have resented it . It is that fraction which openly confesses that they have " always voted as they were told to . " The Congressional Record is full of such admissions . Mr. Aldrich could not sway them by appeals to their cupidity . He could , however , by an appeal to their loyalty to the doctrine , to their hatred of their political opponents . For years he has silenced those who had qualms about a duty by a sneering allusion to " Democratic talk . " " We heard all of that from Mr. Vest , in 1892 , " was his answer to Senator Dolliver 's criticism of the wool schedule . When it came to revising the duties on tin plate the stand-patters tried the same argument ? " false to protection . " The shame of it finally drew from Senator Dolliver this outraged protest : " Is it possible , " he said , " that a man , because he voted for the Allison tin-plate rate of 1889 and heard poor McKinley dedicate the first tin-plate mill in America , can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if he desires that schedule roixamined , after seeing the feeble enterprise of 1890 grown within a single decade to the full measure of this market-place , organized into great corporations , overcapitalized into a speculative trust , and at length unloaded on the United States Steel Company , with a. rakeoff to the promoters sufficient to buy the Rock Island system ? If a transaction like that has made no impression upon the mind of Congress , I expose no secret in saying that it has made a very profound impression on the thought and purpose of the American people . " In this outburst of Senator Dolliver we have the heart of the insurgent revolt against stand-patism . In essence it is a revolt against years of betrayal of the principles the stand-patters were pretending to uphold , of solemn-faced defense of things which are not so , of silencing critics by sneers and threats . And for what ? That those who support then by votes and campaign donations may monopolize the great industries of this land and pile increasing burdens on the backs of its humble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand the real meaning of standpatism and declare as did Senator Dolliver last June : " So far as I am concerned , I am through with it . I intend to fight it . . . . I intend to fight without fear ? I do not care what may be my political fate . I have had a burdensome and toilsome experience in public life now these twenty-five years . I am beginning to feel the pressure of that burden . I do not propose that the remaining years of my life , whether they be in public affairs or in my private business , shall be given up to a dull consent to the success of all these conspiracies , which do not hesitate before our very eyes to use the lawmaking power of the United States to multiply their own profits and to fill the market-places with witnesses of their avarice and of their greed . " Shall We Nationalize the Stand-Patter ? If the stand-patter were confined to his original heath , if he never meddled with anything but the tariff , he would be , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence than he is . It is the extension  | of his way of looking at things into other questions , the adoption of his methods by other classes , the support he gives all who think and act as he thinks and acts that makes him a menace . It is he who argues and fights for a Ballinger , who welcomes a Lorimer to the Senate , who is as indignant at a questioning of a railroad rate , as a questioning of a tariff , who looks on ship subsidies as a proper way of using public money , who can be counted on to support anybody 's privilege , anybody 's plea if he himself is unmolested . To him all free thinking and speaking are unpleasant . He does not like investigations . - He hates publicity . He sees only anarchy in government regulation , confiscation in control of franchises and natural resources , pure socialism in all talk of better distribution of wealth . To his mind the prosperity of the nation depends on bringing all the people to accepting his way of looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he is not doing his best to cultivate his peculiar type of mind . In every industry , in every school , in every social circle , in every church even , in this land , stand-patism is fostered ; often ignorantly fostered , no doubt , but more often deliberately , for that way lies security for what you have already been able to put your hands on , and also the best chance of adding to what you have , whether it be position , privilege or endowment . What we really face is the question : Shall we nationalize the stand-pat intellect ? Do we want it to become the American type of mind ? This is what is actually tied up in Insurgency . That movement is an attack primarily on devious ways of thinking , on blinking at facts and the plain logic of things . It is an attempt to force a whole party to look at things as they are , to follow direct and open lines of reasoning . It is this which gives to the study of the protective tariff and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its industrial importance . It is in handling the tariff that the stand-pat intellect has developed and it is there we can most readily and clearly understand its processes . For the sake of our own intellectual integrity , even more than for the sake of putting wool again on the backs of the poor and of making a little more difficult the cruel schemes of the trust makers , serious folks who love their country and want to see its democratic ways preserved must get down to tariff study . It is true that it is not an easy or particularly enlivening occupation . It is true that it has hung over us so long that it is highly unpopular . In the making of the last bill a Southern Congressman began his speech by saying that down his way mentioning the word tariff was sufficient provocation for drawing a gun on a man . The only reason that this is not true in other parts of the land is due to the people being less free with the gun ! The Tariff ' a Question of National Morals Almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bore . People have not wanted to hear about it and they would not think about it . They escaped by declaring themselves protectionists or free traders or frankly saying they did n't know and did n't care . They may have had a vague uneasiness about what it was doing , but they drowned the feeling by absorption in questions which interested them more and which were simpler . And so we have the bulk of the actively good people in the country who hate injustice and its results busying themselves with devising laws and institutions to relieve evils which tariff and kindred abuses have caused ! Part of this indifference is , no doubt , due to the fact that few people have realized that the tariff is intimately connected with the conditions of our daily life which they deplore . What have import duties to do with health , with happiness , they ask ? It is still in the minds of the many a theory , not a practice which takes a tighter and tighter grip on the daily life of every man , woman and child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we may eat and how we shall be sheltered and warmed . And not alone that , but ordering how we shall think , whether we shall attack life with frankness or evasion . Nor is this all there is wrapped up in the question of protection as we are applying it . Deeper than the wrongs it is doing the poor , deeper than its warping of the intellect , is the question of the morals which underlie its operations . Simmered down to its final sense the tariff question as it stands in this country to-day is a question of national morals . And it is that phase of it that will be taken up in the next and last paper in this series .
