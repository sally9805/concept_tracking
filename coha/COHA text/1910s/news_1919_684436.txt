txt Can Senator POINDEXTER and Senator BORAH hold their own against the civilized nations of the earth , all sick of war ? If what they say of the draft of the Constitution of the League of Nations is true , if the objections they raise are valid , then they might be urged with equal point and force in behalf of every one of the fourteen civilized nations whose representatives approved the draft . Sovereignty is an attribute of every independent nation , it belongs to all in equal measure . If by accepting membership in the League we surrender our sovereignty , then all the other members surrender theirs . Do these Senatorial opponents ask us to believe that the delegates at Paris have one and all betrayed their Governments into such a renunciation ? Senator POINDEXTER , in his Senate speech , declared that the Constitution of the League , as drafted , is in conflict with the Constitution of the United States , that it surrenders American sovereignty to the European nations , and that , in accepting it , we should surrender the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect to sovereignty may be bracketed together , since an infringement of one would infringe the other . Will it comfort Senator PowDEXTER if the admission be made at once that in entering the League we should in some degree relinquish rights as a sovereign nation ? Lest the Senator be too much comforted and emboldened , let us hasten to say that there is nothing new in that . For centuries the nations 3 ave little by little been abandoning sovereign rights . Whenever the Supreme Court upholds a principle of international law , we part with a fragment of our sovereignty . If the nations were absolutely sovereign , they would , of course , have the right to be judges of their own conduct on land and sea . But all nations respect a declared and effective blockade , their ships submit to being stopped and searched , which , of course , would be a flagrant offense against sovereignty if they did not assent to it . The cave-man was very much a sovereign . He could go out and slay his neighbor for any reason that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . In organized society man has surrendered that right , with many others . The social compact is a body of such renunciations , all made for the general good There have been innumerable protests , anarchists have railed against government and society much as the opponents of the League now rail against the League . Anarchists would prefer th old way , the large freedom of the cave period . They would have a fierce joy in slaying their neighbor , particularly if he were a capitalist or a bourgeois , just as the Bolsheviki have been- doing in Russia , with nobody to call them to account . We can not for a moment suppose that Senator POINDEXTER and Senator BORAH regret the passing of the cave period in international politics , that they really long for a return to the conditions of international society as it was organized only a short five years - ago , when the Teuton giant was preparing to cudgel the civilized world into submission and there was no league of the nations to bid him stay his hand and keep the peace . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two Senators we have mentioned and to all who have raised their voices against the League , a question which should be pressed upon them until they answer it . If they will not have the League of Nations , what would they have in its place ? The great war has set the world forward , it is not going back to pre:war conditions . Men of all nations have formed very clear ideas about the causes of war , they are determined to remove them . Fourteen nations took part in preparing the draft , and Mr. WILSON said that " the result was reached unanimously . " If the delegates to the Peace Conference were all misrepresentative of their nations , the League 's structure will collapse before it is erected . There is no evidence that they . NTere misrepresentative . The great mass of the testimony is of a contrary import . The very fact that these chosen men approve this compact of the nations as an assurance against war is a testimony of the very greatest weight and value that the project of the League @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We are altogether confident that it has the approval of the American people , and the character of the attack made upon it in the United States Senate lends support to that belief . The criticisms of Senator POINDEXTER and Senator BORAH have an all too familiar ring . They are mere platform declamation , they seem to be the outcome of the party habit and of party necessity of " viewing with alarm " the policies and doings of the other party . Mr. TA ? r is a very good Republican , he has held office as a Judge , as President of the United States . He is not alarmed about the Constitution , yet he is certainly as well informed concerning that instrument , as sensitive of violations of it , as Senator BORAH or Senator POINDEXTER . He holds the view which THE TIMES has expressed , that the League of Nations , so far from abrogating the Monroe Doctrine , adopts the principles of President MONROE 'S message and applies them to the whole world . Ex-President TAFT is much nearer to the heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the League . Their arguments do not convince , for the people give no sign of being -- roused by them . Yet who can possibly imagine the American people preserving this Arange quiet when confronted by a real danger to their Constitution , to their sovereignty , and to the Monroe Doctrine to which they have given their unfailing support for nearly a century ? Tha people of the United States , warned by costly experience that their remoteness from Europe does not guarantee them against dangers arising from the wars of Europe , desire permanent peace . It is a fervent desire , they will not be cheated of their wish through paying heed to unreal objections against the project of the League , they will not abandon the reality of assured peace th rough the League of Nations for the shadowy phantoms which possess the minds and prompt the . utterances of Senator POINDEXTER and Senator BORAH . They will not be content that the League of Nations plan shall be abandoned unless something better is proposed in its ' place . What better plan do the Senators propose ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
