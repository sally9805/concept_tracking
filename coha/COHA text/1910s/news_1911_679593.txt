txt The fast Jersey Central steamer Monmouth did not reach her pier at this place on her last trip from . New York until nearly midnight last night , because she had run into the converted power sloop Madeline of Port Monmouth while crossing the West Bank . She hit the vessel at full speed , cutting her bow off and rolling her over . The wreck righted for a few minutes , and the to b middle-aged men aboard , Capt . George Boyce , the owner , and John Phillips , the engineer , both of Port Monmouth , were rescued by a lifeboat from the steamer , which then made several attempts to save what was left of their vessel , which sank with everything aboard . The only thing which the men saved was , by an odd coincidence , a book of Pilot 's Rules , which Phillips had In his hip pocket . The Monmouth had delivered in New York a fair shipload of returning weekenders from the North Jersey Coast resorts when she left her pier at West Forty-second Street at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hazy and the sea somewhat lumpy , when at 10:09 , just as she made the West Bank light and shaped her course to starboard for the southwest Spit by the Chapel Hill Range Lights , her bow lookout shouted , " Motor boat ahead . No lights ! " Simultaneously terrified screams arose directly under the flier 's razor prow , and almost instantly followed by the crash of the collision . Four bells and a jingle rang out . " Full speed astern ' " in the engine room , but the Monmouth ran more than a quarter of a mile before the combined power of her twin screw engines brought her to a standstill . I She was in fact still forging slowly ahead when Lifeboat No. 3 , under command of Second Officer David K. Danielson , ' with Quartermaster Jacob U. Jurgenson and three seamen , struck the water from its davits on the hurricane deck just to starboard of the twin smokestacks , and the ship 's log shows that it was just 10:12 when the boat crossed the Monmouth 's stern and sped away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fro , while Jurgenson and the sailors shouted . Presently their hails were answered by a faint : " Here we are . Help ! " They only located the wreck by the rays of the West Bank Lighthouse , v.rhIgh suddenly-fell full upon It . The men were huddled together in the stern . Jorgenson helped l n into the boat and tho Monmouth , which all the time had been backing carefully down upon them , sighted them and took them on at the after port gangway . Both were hardly able to stand , and the Chief Engineer sent them at once to the firerooms , where their clothes- were dried In the furnace heat and stimulants were supplied . When they had somewhat recovered the Captain of the Monmouth who , with his officers , at first feared there had been more than the twain on the Madeline . Interviewed them . Capt . Boyce told him that the Madeline. a 30-foot fishing and oyster sleep , recently converted into a power boat , was the largest part of his possessions and his means of livelihood . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cargo of clams , all of which he had landed at South Beach . After accumulating a mixed cargo of such commodities as they could obtain on Sunday , they had started for home under the protection of a white lantern on the bow . Capt . Boyce said he had just installed a new engine at a cost of $145 , and knowing that their course should not take them anywhere near the old Main Ship Channel , which the Sandy Hook fliers still use , and believing they had the bay to themselves , as they saw nothing but the shore lights , they removed their lantern Into the hold to study the workings of the new motor . How they came to have run so far to the eastward they could not explain , but the first thing they knew they saw the glare of the Monmouth 's navigation light and cabin electrics in their eyes , and her rushing cutwater almost against their port side . The Captain of the Monmouth grimly congratulated them , for he said if the Monmouth had struck the Madeline astern instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both . The Monmouth made fast to the wreck , intending to tow it slowly to shore , but the line had hardly drawn taut when the cleat and a section of shattered timbers broke away , and , seeing that the Madeline was full of water , the Monmouth went on , and baymen to-day , scouring the scene of the accident , could find no trace of the Madeline . This is the first accident the Monmouth has had since she and J. Pierpont Morgan 's yacht Corsair fouled off Sandy Hook while racing home from the America 's Cup races of 1.1 ) 03 , both vessels being considerably damaged , and for which both the late Capt . ? Samuel G. Martin , who then commanded the steamboat , and the Corsair 's sailing master bad their I licenses suspended for a period of weeks after a trial before the United States Inspectors . Both sentences , however , were set to take effect the following December , when both veseis should be laid up . Quartermaster Jorgenson distinguished himself a couple of seasons ago by leaplag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in New York and saving after a hard fight a young men who was trying to drown himself . For this he received $10 , a handshake , and a treasured letter from the father of the would-be suicide . The exact speed of the Sandy Hook boats is a company secret , but the Monmouth is known to cover her , route in all stages of wind and tide at close to twenty miles an hour , and the Asbury Park is rated even faster . The Sandy Hook of the same line sunk a motor boat in broad daylight off the Statue of Liberty last Summer , but did not stop , as the two occupants of the motor boat ' were picked up by a-following tug . Both she and the Monmouth bad only their white paint scratched from plowing through the smaller vessels. - ? A short time before the Asbury Park missed by less than twenty feet a crowded motorboat which sheered directly Into her path on a brilliant moonlit night at nearly the'same spot where the Madeline went down , when the occupants , , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the passengers and crew with . bad language .
