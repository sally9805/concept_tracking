Mr. Sherrill does not , so far as we can judge from the newspaper report of his address , allege the Monroe Doctrine as the all-sufficing argument for whatever we want to do . Whatever the Monroe Doctrine does or does not mean , every form of it has explicitly excepted the existing European possessions in this hemisphere . So that is left out . The suggestion is merely that this would be a happy conjuncture of which - to take advantage in order to make the war cover literally the whole earth . But about the desirability of this , we fancy that Mr. Sherrill will find his countrymen  --  those of them , at least , who take the trouble to give any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he seems to be . Sir Edward Carson 's reasons for resigning from the Cabinet are merely excellent reasons why he never should have entered it . He had no personal disgusts to allege . He declares that party politics had not been so much as whispered about in the Cabinet . Nor was it on a question of principle that he broke with his colleagues . It was solely a difference of opinion regarding the policy to be pursued in the Near East . Even as to that , far be it from.him to say that he was right and the rest of the Cabinet wrong . Only , he could not bring himself to stay . But , obviously , one of such temper is not a man for any Cabinet . If he is not ready , as Gladstone used to phrase it , to put his mind into the common pot , the Cabinet is no place for him . He may at any moment be outvoted , like other members , on one question or another , so that his resignation , on Sir Edward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ timber no Cabinet can be built . Carson 's resignation of office , on the grounds he alleges , only shows that he never should have accepted it . Mr. Paderewski 's eloquence as a speaker and his virtuosity as a pianist are reported to have netted $12,000 for the Polish Relief Fund . But this is only a trifle in view of the heartbreaking needs of the Poles in the entire section which they inhabit . For them hope deferred truly maketh the heart sick . There is no word out of Berlin or Vienna or Petrograd to say what their fate shall be . All talk of the early reestablishment of the Polish kingdom under a Hapsburg Archduke has ceased . If for the moment the fighting has swept past  --  and over ? the bulk of the Poles , there is no assurance that it will not return . Meanwhile , with winter approaching they must build upon the wreck of their homes and their farms as best they can . The world , for obvious reasons , has not found the Polish misfortunes so dramatically appealing as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything greater . Immediate and earnest attention should be given by the Government to the grievance presented in the statement of Edgar F. Luckenbach , president of the Luckenbach Steamship Company . It certainly seems amazing that there should be an increase of freight rates on the Panama Railroad , at the very time when the obstruction of the canal is upsetting all plans based upon its continuous operation . Mr. Luckenbach declares that the new rail rates at Panama will mean a loss of from $600,000 to $700,000 a year to his company if it continues in the coastwise traffic  --  traffic between our Atlantic and Pacific coasts  --  which has been its business . It would seem as though the La Follette act had done enough to disturb and displace American- shipping business , without the addition of this fresh handicap . If the facts are as Mr .. Luckenbach represents ? and his statement looks very plain and straightforward  --  a very unjust and ill-considered policy has been adopted , and the whole question should be thoroughly looked into before serious and lasting mischief is done . Incidentally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangers that attend Government ownership and management of transportation facilities . The first train over the Canadian Northern , to Vancouver , following so closely the opening of the Grand Trunk to Prince Rupert , is but one index of a change reported over all the Canadian West . The Pacific slope is made a front door , instead of a back door , in anticipation of the full utilization of the Panama Canal . Formerly , the biggest elevators were built east , the medium-sized ones in Alberta , Saskatchewan , and Manitoba . Now the largest are going up at points in the far West , the three transcontinental roads are building large repair shops at Coquitlam , Prince Rupert , and Port Mann , and the big traction and wire companies of Birmingham , Cleveland , and Pittsburgh are looking over the region for sites . From Fort William on Lake Superior to points in the Alberta wheat fields is from twelve hundred to fifteen hundred miles . From the Pacific ports to these points is less than half that distance . The Pacific ports are always open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alberta grain has to go on to St. John . With the rates by water one-tenth those by land , much even of Manitoba and Saskatchewan grain may be sent west . This is a dizzy time for Republican Favorite Sons . After being froWned upon for a generation , they are suddenly seized by the hand and pushed into seats right next the fire . The more the merrier , exclaims Paterfamilias Hilles , while the flames brighten and each member of the cheerful circle sees " 1916 " glowing in the embers and twisting tantalizingly in the ascending smoke . How different from a short four years ago , when the space in front of the fire was kept cleared for a big arm-chair . How different from the time before that , when a new and powerful steam-roller puffed threateningly up and down before the door . What heart would not beat faster at the slogan , A fair field and no favors and may the best man win ! Only , there must be a best man , of course , and suppose that by some mysterious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revealed to a select few before the race really started . Suppose that the select few could not keep the sacred knowledge to themselves , but went about whispering it in the ears of the judges . Sup- , pose that the judges did not feel like flying-in the face of destiny , and announced the name of the winner just as he and his competitors were about to start around the track . But this is to anticipate . For the moment , every Favorite Son has the happiness of picturing himself enjoying the fatted calf . It would be a pity to spoil the dream . The Massachusetts German-American organizations in convention last Sunday showed great skill in avoiding action calculated to injure the chances of any aspirant to public honors . The resolution adopted completely allayed any fears that either the Republican or the Democratic candidate for Governor may have entertained that he might be - made the recipient of an endorsement . " We do not desire , " says the resolution , " as an organization to endorse any candidate for Governor . " Having thus avoided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even better by President Wilson . In his case the convention not only withheld endorsement , but put itself on record as " firmly opposed to the reelection of Woodrow Wilson as President of the United States . " This circumstance may not go very far towards helping to reelect Mr. Wilson , but every little helps . An interesting . correspondence has been - going on between the Governors of Pennsylvania and South Carolina . It concerns a negro accused of murder , whose extradition is asked by the Southern State . Gov . Brumbaugh has been courtesy itself , but has wanted to assure himself that the accused would have a fair trial . He does not forget that his own State has been disgraced by outbreaks of the mob , but he has felt a certain responsibility upon the point nevertheless . The Columbia State , in reviewing the correspondence , makes no attempt to palliate the lynchings that have occurred , but pleads that they have been exceptional . Judges and juries usually give full justice to a negro on trial . It is candid enough to admit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between black and white , but holds that this is not because of over-strictness towards the negro , but because of over-leniency towards the white . Judges are pretty mire to see that the negro gets his legal rights , no more and no less , but are not so certain to see that the white man does not get more than his rights . It hardly need be said that the lynching of an extradited negro would make it embarrassing for the State in which the lynching occurred to ask for the extradition of another one . To future generations it will make little difference just when wireless telephony began to give promise of realization , but ours may well have a thrill of gratification over the fact that the conversations between Arlington and Paris have taken place at just this time . Not all thought and all energy , in those awful years , history will record , were spent in devising , or carrying out means of destruction and slaughter . There was a residuum of effort left for better things . While General Staffs were studying complicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were working as hard upon problems no less baffling , but for results that would bring peoples closer together rather than drive them further apart . The wireless telephone , even in its present unfinished form , is the outcome of a ten years ' war conducted in thoroughly organized fashion and won by the slow method of conquering one difficulty and then another . If its development has lacked the dash and romance which have made the story of some inventions so interesting , it is not wanting in other qualities which marked also the most notable American experiments of recent years , those of the Wright brothers . One of these qualities , persistence , is not usually placed so high as it deserves among our native traits . The city of Montgomery , Ala. , was managed by five commissioners . The administration of affairs being unsatisfactory to the people , the question arose of a reduction of the five commissioners to three . No referendum was had , but the question became an issue in the election of representatives to the Legislature , and in this indirect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her sister city of Birmingham meanwhile was managed by three commissioners . The administration of affairs being unsatisfactory to the people , the question arose of an increase of the three commissioners to five . The Birmingham delegation in the Legislature agreed to leave the decision of the question to a referendum , and last week the referendum was held . A " clear majority " was given to the proposal to change from three commissioners to five . Morals are drawn in Alabama from this tale of two cities . One of them is that Americans have a " restless feeling " towards their city government ; another , that the commission form is not always a glittering success . But the great lesson is overlooked . Is not the ideal number of commissioners four ? Both in itself , and as encouraging the movement for supervision by the States of institutions granting degrees , a proposed bill creating a board in the Interior Department to set proper standards for the colleges and universities of the District of Columbia will deserve attention by the next Congress . The latest protest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " college " comes from the Washington Board of Trade . There have even been degree-granting or degree-selling colleges in Washington which have existed only on paper . Senator Gallinger has cooperated in drawing up the bill , which requires proof of both financial and scholarly standing . In the States , the tendency to supervision has become strong . In the last five years New Jersey , Arkansas , Michigan , Massachusetts , and Maryland have authorized bodies to exercise much the same general oversight which we have had for a longer period in New York and Pennsylvania . Collegiate Squeerses certainly ought not to be tolerated in the Federal District . To the least vengeful , there is more than a suggestion of poetic justice in the welcome of Madero 's widow in Mexico City . Thirty-two months cover the crowded time since the murder of the man who succeeded Diaz , a murder that determined nothing but the fate of the adventurer who decreed it . Amid all the kaleidoscopic changes of the past two years , with revolt within revolt , the First Chief has apparently been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last he is able , having put his enemies under his feet , to give in the blood-stained capital official welcome and more than official protection to the person who peculiarly embodies that memory . Yet not in the name of the victorious leader who has carried the banner of Madero to triumph , but on behalf of the Constitutionalist Government , did the Military Commander extend to Seiiora Madero greeting and the freedom of the city . Those who hope that the ascendency of Carranza will mean not only the restoration of order , but also the birth of political life , will be heartened by this emphasis upon law rather than leader . Anything else would be to kill the spirit of Madero as well as his body , and so to make a mocking of honors to his name . Regarding the prospects of monarchy or republicanism in China , the dispatches vary from day to day . At the present moment the republicans seem to be having the better of the argument , but Yuan Shi-Kai is still described as wavering between the two , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proffered crown on the Lupercal . But as a matter of fact , Yuan Shi-Kal 's stand has been more definite . It seems to have escaped general attention that , early in September , the President of the Republic came out firmly against monarchy . The Peking Gazette for September 6 gives in full the text of a message addressed the day before to the Council of State . In this statement Yuan Shi-Kai alludes to the petitions brought forward in favor of a change of government , admits that the purpose of the petitioners is patriotic and sincere , but speaks out directly : The duty being mine to maintain the general situation , I have to state that I regard the proposed change as unsuitable to the circumstances of the country . Furthermore , it is not uncertain that a suitable and practicable law will be devised if due consideration of the conditions of the country and ripe discussion enter into the preparation of the Constitution of the Republic which is now being drafted . This shows the situation in a light not always reflected by the news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
