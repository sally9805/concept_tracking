McSpadden 's Synopses of Shakespeare 's plays , Dickens 's novels , and Scott 's Waverley novels bespeak the demand in which this convenient little series is held ( Crowell ; 75 cents net , each ) . Bulfinch 's Mythology has , it seems , maintained its appeal into the present generation of readers . It is now issued ( Crowell ; $1.50 net ) in a single serviceable volume , with good print , containing the Age of Fable ; The Age of Chivalry , and Legends of Charlemagne . The book is furnished with thirty-two illustrations . We have received from the West Publishing Co. of St. Paul , Minn. , " Compiled Statutes of the United States , Embracing the Statutes of the United States , of a General and Permanent Nature , in Force December 31 , 1913 , " compiled by John A. Mallory , assisted by members of the publishers ' ? editorial staff . We need scarcely add that this work , which is in five stout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about in the banking system of the United States by the passage of the Federal Reserve act in December , 1913 , has , no doubt , been the occasion of a new fifth edition of Mr. Horace White 's " Money and Banking " and of Prof. Joseph French Johnson 's " Money and Currency . " Both these well-known textbooks have been reissued by Ginn &; Co. ( $1.50 ; $1.75 ) , with added chapters discussing the new legislation . Mr. White does not offer any detailed opinion as to the probable working of the act beyond saying that " the fact that the national banks have joined together with practical unanimity to put it in operation makes it highly probable that it will be a success " ( p. 449 ) . Professor Johnson is not quite so hopeful , and considers that " it is impossible to foretell the effects of the establishment of this new banking system " ( p. 378 ) . He points out that it contains features which were " the subject of severe criticism from many quarters " ( p. 380 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the national banks , compulsory rediscounts by one regional bank for another , the number of regional banks , the nature and conditions of issue of the new notes , and the adequacy of control provided . It is this last feature to which failure of the law , if it should occur , will probably have to be charged . Professor Johnson definitely favors the " one central bank " idea as the scientific way of meeting the currency requirements of a country like the United States . One turns to Mary Edith Durham 's " The Fight for Scutari " ( Longmans , Green ; $4 net ) , prepared for disappointment . Nothing in international politics that is older than August , 1914 , can have interest or value . And if it comes to fighting , what possible comparison is there between the desultory raids and snipings and petty starvations of the Albanian highlanders and the mighty European melodrama ? One finds Miss Durham 's book fascinating . Possflbly because the gigantic battlefields and holocausts of the world war after all leave the imagination dulled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its very concreteness . And after all the petty turmoils of Albania in 1910-12 were the prelude to the great drama of 1914 . Albania it was that gave the signal for the Balkan upheaval against the New Turk and hastened on the two wars which , by humbling the Turk and exalting the Serb , brought on the great conflict . Thus one gets the rare sensation of watching , in the interplay of petty chieftains and the wars of small tribes , a Punch and Judy show which , by a swift darkening and illumination of the theatre , revels as " Macbeth . " Nor is it the least charm of the book that it is written by an observer who was a participant in a very rare sense . Miss Durham , by long acquaintance and sympathy , had made herself a power among the mountaineers of the Adriatic coastlands , taming the savage tribes whom Rome and the Ottomans had failed to subdue . To her come shaggy highland chiefs for advice and intercession , governors , prime ministers , princes of the blood , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much as of the wise women whom the early Teutonic tribesmen honored and obeyed ; except in the spirited partisanship with which she defends the cause of her favorite Albanians against their betrayers ? Turk , Montenegrin , or Serb . The merit of " Thistledown : A Book of-Scotch Humor , Character , Folk-Lore , Story , and Anecdote " ( Stokes ; $1.75 net ) , by Robert Ford , resides in the countless and often delightful anecdotes that the author has gathered , rather than in his study of the nature of Scotch humor . The book is , indeed , little more than a collection of illustrations of Scotch humor roughly classified under such heads as Old Scotch Divines , Scotch Precentors , Dram-Drinking , Scottish Rural Life , Scotch Naturals . The author has shown more than ordinary skill in excluding pointless stories , and in including stories that , in addition to being amusing , afford an insight into Scotch character . The foreign air ofthe book is enhanced by colored drawings well executed by John Duncan , and by the author 's curious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and contains more than one " manifest Scotticism . " One anecdote will suffice to reward the reader of the present paragraph : " Jock , " cried a farmer 's wife to her cowherd , " come awa ' in to your parritch , or the flees ' ill be droonin ' themsel 's in your milk bowl . " " Nae fear o ' that , " was Jock 's roguish reply . " They 'll wade through . " " Ye scoondrel , " cried the mistress indignantly , " d'ye mean to say that ye dinna get eneuch milk ? " " Ou , ay , " said Jock , " I get plenty o ' milk for a ' the parritch . " The melancholy interest which attaches to the unfortunate illegitimates of the great is sufficiently related in Hector Fleishmann 's " Unknown Son of Napoleon " ( John Lane ; $3 net ) . It might more properly have been entitled an unfortunate or unwelcome son , for Count Leon was only too well known under the Second Empire. , pestering his cousin for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , this eldest son of Napoleon died in Paris in 1881 , and was laid in a pauper 's grave by the side of the nameless poor and needy . He left four children , one of whom , following the spirit of adventure innate in the Bonaparte family , became a leading light in Buffalo Bill 's Wild West Show . In the first half of his volume the author reveals the seamy side of the domestic life of a certain Revel , paymaster of dragoons , and his pretty eighteen-year-old wife , Eleonore Denuelle de la Plaigne , who in 1806 became by Napoleon the mother of Count Leon . The Emperor manifested a certain affection for this boy , who was proof that Josephine 's childlessness was not due to her imperial husband 's incapacity . He secretly acknowledged his own paternity by placing Leon under the guardianship of the Meneval. family and by making financial provision for him . The second half of the volume is devoted more Particularly to describing Count Leon 's unfortunate and unedifying downward career . Under Louis Philippe 's Government , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thiers and Beranger and the St. Helena literature , Leon became a member of the National Guard and enjoyed a certain specious popularity on account of his striking physical resemblance to his father . But already he had got into difficulties by his spendthrift habits and worthless . associates His cousins and uncles would not receive him . This led to the farcical attempt at a duel with Louis Napoleon on Wimbledon Common in 1840 , when the Bow Street police interfered and Boston 's benefactor , Joshua Bates , went bail for the future good behavior of his Napoleonic friend . In an appendix the author examines the stories as to Napoleon 's other alleged children ; he concludes that only three are proved ? Count Leon , Count Walewski , and the King of Rome . Wilson King 's " Chronicles of Three Free Cities : Hamburg , Bremen , Lilbeck " ( Dutton ; $4 net ) does not profess to add anything to German historical research into the past of the three remaining Hanseatic cities ; it is rather a modest but assiduous attempt on the part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in English and American readers an interest like his own in records of civic and commercial achievement . An introduction by J. P. Mahaffy gives a brief survey of the development of trading cities from Tyre to Liverpool , and calls attention to the European aspect of Mr. King 's subject . Mr. King 's own narrative is quite detailed and circumstantial , every where sympathetic , and nowhere dull . Numerous illustrations in black and white , and a few in colors , have been contributed by Mrs. King and others They not only serve the purpose of vivifying the narrative , but are excellent in themselves . A. W. Holland 's " Germany " in the series called The Making of the Nations ( Macmillan ; $2 net ) gives in a sober style an authentic outline of German history from the time of the migrations to the end of the Year 1913 . From the nature of the case , the greater part of the book is a record of wars , but there are brief considerations of the causes and the results of conflicts , as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The book is illustrated with maps and many good photogravures . In " John Hay : Author and Statesman " ( Dodd , Mead ; $1 net ) , Prof. Lorenzo Sears gives a pleasant eulogy of the American public man who , more than any other of his time , seems to have taken hold on the hearts of his countrymen . Hay 's work as Secretary of State has passed into a legend , and Professor Sears carries forward the idealizing process . We do not imply that much of this idealization was not austified ; we merely wish that the eulogist had had more acquaintance with the inside facts of Hay 's life and work so that he could have made little impression of one too good For human nature 's daily food , which Hay himself would have been the first to smile at and disavow . We have before us three additions to , the already mighty company of Napoleonic books of recent arrival . Of these , Major Arthur Griffiths 's " Life of Napoleon " ( Philadelphia : Lippincott ; $1.75 net ) is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story pleasantly retold . The work appears without prefatory excuse , nor are we enlightened as to the class of reader for whom it is intended . Scarcely for young searchers after truth . Perhaps the old may read it and feel young again  --  safe in that they are beyond being misled by the , art ' of the storyteller . It is enlivened by an attractive Napoleonic portrait gallery . The title of William Henry Hudson 's volume , " The Man Napoleon " ( Crowell ; $1.50 net ) , is its justification . It is , in fact , a careful and eminently readable study of the life of the great Corsican , disengaged , so far as possible , from history , " which is treated only as the background and setting of his career . " For this relief , much thanks . Drum and trumpet history , under guise of biography , is fast becoming an intolerable nuisance The author 's own feelings in regard to Napoleon 's character ? " not admiration , but aversion , not unmingled with pity and contempt " ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candid and judicial throughout The illustrations are unusually good . In " The Decline and Fall of Napoleon " ( Philadelphia : Lippincott ; $1.25 net ) is republished , in book form , a series of articles by the late Viscount Wolseley which originally appeared in the Pall Mall Magazine . Intend-ed as a study of the strength and weakness ? as exhibited in his last disastrous campaigns ? of the leader whom the author regarded as " a superhuman genius " and " by far the greatest of all men , " these collected papers have a special appeal just now , bringing out , as they do , many points of comparison and contrast in Napoleon 's final struggle with that at present raging . Then , as until quite recently , Russia was , from a military point of view , the unknown quantity . Then , as now , unhappy Belgium was the cockpit of Europe . From the days of Tristram Shandy onwards we have had many studies under many names of the engaging personality that has gained world-wide recognition as " Mr. Thomas Atkins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revealing , or more lovable than that sketched in the little collection of extracts from his own letters from the front , entitled " Tommy Atkins at War , as Told in His Own Letters " ( McBride , 50 cents ) , and ably edited by Mr. James A. Kilpatrick . His pluck , his kindliness , his patience , and his good-nature stand out the more compellingly because their expression is so unstudied ; and we realize , if we contrast them with the most capable literary " studies " from the outside , how ineffective is the mot juste when compared with the plain truth Naturally the editor of these letters has sought here and there to point the moral , but his intrusions are delicately conceived , and do not spoil the picture . To gain some real idea of the actual conditions under which the greatest of wars is being fought and of the personalities which make up one of the contending imperative . Incidentally , although it is from the nature of the case one-sided , the editor has striven to be fair to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the argument , and it is perhaps a pity in this connection that certain references to " barbarities " in the chapter . Tommy Atkins and the Enemy , obviously written in the very heat of battle , were not omitted . There was need of a short history of India , " up to date " in respect of geographical and racial information , and in " Ancient India from the Earliest Times to the First Century A. D. " ( Cambridge University Press ; Putnam ; 75 cents ) , E. J. Rap-son , has filled the need . Not so archmological as the volume on " Antiquities of India , " recently reviewed in these columns , this little book is yet based on both literary and monumental evidence . Its author is well known as an authority on numismatics , and he has brought to the making of this work a great store of knowledge from his own field . Coins and inscriptions are of prime importance in constructing the history of a land practically without a history of its own . Especially is this true of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ c . For the still earlier period , Professor Rapson offers no new material save that which shows the Dravidians to have been not original inhabitants , but invaders from the northwest , like the Aryans . It might have been said also that the Aryans themselves probably entered India in different hosts of different dialectic characteristics . Of the civilization of the earliest literary period , not 3000 but circa 1200 B. C. the author gives an excellent summary in which modern German scholarship has not been neglected . By the third century B. c. theadmirable survey begins to show the result of the author 's independent researches . Here , too , is room to question whether some of Professor Rapson 's statements may not be adversely criticised , notably in regard to the extent of Asoka 's kingdom , which was perhaps less firmly established in the south than the author asserts . But in general the student may thankfully accept so readable and trustworthy a manual of Indian history and geography as is here presented , particularly as it contains a mass of matter hitherto inaccessible save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of logic and metaphysics in Edinburgh University and a writer on philosophical subjects , died in Edinburgh on December 3 .

A protective-tariff expert , a leader in Congress and a member for so many years without break as to have become the Father of the House , yet one whose sole contribution to permanent literature consists of a pamphlet reprint of one speech , and whose name does not appear in any of the standard encyclopmdias , is a curiosity in these days of self-exploitation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Representative from the Auburn district of New York State . Like his old-time colleague , John H Ketcham , of Poughkeepsie , he had mastered the art of speaking by his very silence ; and he had acquired such a standing in the neighborhood of his home that he was returned , term after term , without any effort on his part . There was nothing picturesque about his personality , as about that of every other member of the little group with whom he acted . He had not Reed 's wit or Dolliver 's eloquence , Cannon 's quaintness or McKinley 's charm , Kelley 's weight or Dingley 's plodding patience . His chief stock in trade , where his official manner was concerned , was a smiling , but not the less deadly , indifference to what any opponent said or thought .

Bailey of Texas might roar " No quorum ! " at , him , and McMillin of Tennessee fling contemptuous epithets in the face of the majority , but the temporary tenant of the chair paid no more heed to them than to the winds which blew outside of the chamber : he would neither reverse his rulings nor entertain an appeal , but , looking not to right or left , kept his gavel beating its relentless tattoo on the desk till the two Democrats were out and the contesting Republicans were in . It was the same way with his share in general debate No man on the floor of the House prepared his basic data in advance with more care , and then he never allowed any one to bait him by drawing him into a controversy over details . He disposed , with his characteristic smile and his equally characteristic silence , of even so tempting a critic as the late Francis W. Cushman of Washington , who , taking for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free because they were only a by-product of the live stock which were protected by strong duties , insisted that , by parity of reasoning , milk and eggs should have their tariff rates removed . Mr Payne was not without a sense of humor , though the joke must be pretty plain to find him instantly appreciative , and he rarely , if ever , told one himself Moreover , he was cautious almost to suspiciousness in dealing with men whom he had not known long enough to understand thoroughly . It is not surprising , therefore , that he passed among his associates as a dependable rather than an attractive man Nearly every one had a pleasant word for him , and his quarrels were too few to be remembered ; but , though an old friend here and there addressed him as Sereno , he never achieved a nickname , even of the affectionate sort .

He began preparing , in his college days , for his work as an explorer by taking a special course in Chinese along with his studies of other living languages , and after graduation sought an appointment as a secretary of legation at Peking for the purpose of perfecting himself in both Chinese and Tibetan . This was no easy task , since every one thereabouts who knew the language of Tibet became suspicious of his designs as soon as he expressed a desire for instruction , and most of what he learned he had to acquire by stealth After four years of such self-training he took his first plunge by disguising himself as a Chinese priest and crossing the border of the Forbidden Land This trip consumed about a year , during which he discovered how to make his way about and divested himself of the notion , then so commonly held in Western Europe and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus he paved the way for a more extended and fruitful tour which he made a year or two later , accompanied by a small retinue of Chinese servants and a bodyguard of ten native soldiers hired from a chief whom he found not wholly impervious to the influence of foreign coin , and equipped with a photographic camera and a few surveying instruments . - How little of a pleasure-jaunt this journey was may be inferred from the fact that in one period of eleven months he covered about eight thousand miles , making his way in the most primitive fashion , crossed sixty-nine passes ranging from 14,000 to 18,000 feet above sea-level ; lived sixty days at an altitude of 15,000 feet , with clothing continuously soaked by storms of rain , hail , or snow , and was unable during this interval to procure any food worth mentioning , and no drink but tea .

He spoke at some length of the necessity of bringing into the habits of Frenchmen the cultivation of their physical person : The Englishman cultivates freely his muscular machine . He considers it a patriotic duty to he in perfect physical condition , in the fulness of muscular efficiency , and to possess the best of health by severe hygiene .
