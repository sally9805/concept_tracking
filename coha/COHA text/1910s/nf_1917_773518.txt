txt HOW TO KNOW YOUR CHILD make him more self-conscious , therefore more sensitive and less willing to make the effort . If we once realize that a child of this type must learn to express his emotions , just as the ordinary little child learns to walk , that in his case it is a slower and more difficult process to get control of the emotional medium than it is to get muscular control , we will once and for all time abandon that tactic of forcing and nagging a sensitive child into action , which can result only in discouragement and failure . In John 's case , the mother ? most important of all steps ! ? early recognized the nature of her child . She saw the evil that might come from that nature , and she saw also the great good . From the start she set about to avoid the danger and develop the promise . While the greatest care was taken not to make him more self-conscious , by calling attention to his shyness , by forcing persons upon him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those closest to him to be warmly expressive to him in greetings and acknowledgments . I00 THE SECRET DOORS OF CHILDHOOD Ile was stimulated to play and mix with other children , but care was taken at the first to make the child forget the personal clement in this contact . The interest was always centered outside of him , in the game , or in the working-material . A common interest brings children as well as adults closer together and the personnels are forgotten . As soon as it was realized that John was having real pleasure out of his association with other children , that it was becoming easier for him to work and play with them , his mother gradually began to encourage him to express his satisfaction . But instead of ordering or asking him to do it , she would at the end of the game very noticeably thank the children for playing with John , wish them good-by , shake hands all around , and merely suggest to John , casually , without pressure , that he do the same . At first in response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ask t o go home . This the mother apparently would not notice , never reprimanding him IOI HOW TO KNOW YOUR CHILD or making a scene , as is so often and so cruelly done , in the presence of friends ? a course which is particularly offending to a sensitive child . Oftentimes it was plain that John had the keenest desire to stretch out his little hand and say good-by , but he could not get himself to do it . This suggestion the mother would follow up at home during her play-period with him . " Let us play visiting , " she would say . Instantly John would become the host and the mother the guest . In the most serious fashion the mother would knock at the door , walk in , greet John , shake hands with him , talk to him about different things in a grown-up way . Then she would change into another visitor and he into another host , and so it would go on , each representing different people . This playing was done in so spirited a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was made dramatic and attractive and impersonal . After such a game the mother would suggest : " Wo n't it be fun to do it with real friends ? Tomorrow when we IO2 THE SECRET DOORS OF CHILDHOOD play with the other children we will play that game with them in a real way . " Such simple suggestions were repeated often ; and as the child grew older and was better able to understand , the mother would explain very simply to him that it is only kindness to answer and greet people who love you and are interested in you . And so , by degrees , John began , at first very , very slowly , to respond ? with the result , as I have said , that the doors of his being are now open , and he comes out freely , and naturally , and wholesomely to meet the world . It is indeed a slow , a very slow , process to cultivate and set free the social spirit in so sensitive and naturally repressed a child as I have indicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cautious , sympathetic , unfolding process , we are taking terrific chances of making the child close rigidly and defiantly and sullenly up ; or perhaps of so distorting and injuring the soul of the little child that what was originally a fine and promising quality may // become hardened , ugly , embittered , and violent , and may express itself in vicious practises or uncontrollable outbursts . To turn to the worst examples ? a great percentage of our criminals today are men and women who were made into perverts largely through the neglect and the thoughtless suppression and repression of a naturally sensitive nature . // " MY CHILD IS DISOBEDIENT - " " How shall I teach my child to obey me ? " " How shall I punish my child ? " These twin and seemingly inseparable questions summarize the problems presented me by scores of earnest parents ; and it is fair to infer that these are the questions that hundreds of thousands of other parents are asking themselves in irritation , perplexity , and despair . " Obedience , " together with the proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be " punishment " ? these two constitute a universal problem which poignantly revives itself with every new mother . " My child is disobedient ! " Thus have begun hundreds of requests for help made to me by letter or in person . This disobedience seemingly takes as many different forms as there are different children . I05 HOW TO KNOW YOUR CHILD " My little child is defiant to desperation , " writes one mother ? I quote from typical letters ; " how am I to teach her obedience ? " And another parent writes : " Please tell me how to control my little son 's most objectionable trait , contrariness . He has tremendous energy , is highly excitable , keenly alert mentally , has terrific will-power , and is persistent to the point of exhaustion . He can not be punished in the ordinary ways without terrible results , without making him ugly . " " My little girl of three , " writes another mother , " who is normal in every way physically is usually manageable at home , where she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and put her things in order . But she is most unmanageable outside the house . Spanking and putting her in a corner have no effect on her . " And still another mother writes of a boy of four , who is active , spirited , and keen , but who will never take her requests or commands seriously . Thus the cases run on . Before proceeding with these problems , let us try to make clear to ourselves just what Io6 " MY CHILD IS DISOBEDIENT ? " that thing really is which we call by the vague and sweeping term " disobedience " ; let us try to search out what is behind and beneath the behavior which irritates and bewilders us , and renders us desperate . And while we are searching let us also search ourselves with utmost candor for our motive in desiring that our child be obedient . Is it primarily for our own relief ? ? or is it primarily for the child 's betterment ? Let us try to realize , just here , that deplored disobedience and its opposite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far as they are symptoms . The thing which is of prime importance is the child 's condition , of which obedience or disobedience may be merely symptomatic . Looking behind and beneath the comparatively superficial thing we call disobedience , we must try to find the fundamental thing that is wrong in our children ; or the fundamental thing that , perhaps , is wrong in ourselves . Disobedience , diagnosed to its first cause , means primarily that the child 's will is disordered ? that the will is too strongly de-I07 HOW TO KNOW YOUR CHILD veloped in aspects that promise danger for the future , or that it has been under-developed , or that it has been perverted . And , as association and environment are usually important contributing factors in disease , disobedience means that something is probable wrong with the parents . For obedience , in the sense that obedience is something demanded by and given to unquestioning authority , I have little regard . But in discipline I do believe ? and I am led to speak of discipline here for the reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving the child " freedom . " There is nothing contradictory between the two . The ideal freedom behind the best methods of child-training means freedom from unnecessary suppression , from thoughtless , unreasonable , unjust , unsympathetic guidance ; it means freedom from blind , arbitrary direction ; it means freedom to grow , to develop naturally and normally , under constant , consistent , and thoughtful direction ? a " freedom " which implies the severest , strictest Io8 " MY CHILD IS DISOBEDIENT ? " kind of discipline . Indeed , discipline is the very foundation of any wise and sane educational method . But we must remember that discipline is a most powerful instrument , and like all powerful instruments it must be used with great care , with great wisdom . Before we undertake the momentous task of constructive discipline we must , with care and tenderness and sympathy , try to discover what are the traits to be overcome , and what are the good qualities to be developed . The little boy whom one mother describes as having tremendous energy , being persistent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the class where " will " is the paramount problem . This boy requires firm but sympathetic handling , he needs discipline ( not punishment , remember ) , applied wisely to his body , his mind , and his soul . But in disciplining the child 's powers the greatest care must be taken not to break them , and not to lose the child 's respect and affection . // The handling of such a child is indeed a problem , though far , far less serious a problem than that of the child who is anaemic , colorless , who is easily led , and who obeys without question . From the very ! outset the parents must recognize that the former child is one of unusual promise . But they must also realize that a child who has physical strength , whose intellect is keen , whose emotions are powerful , will , so long as these forces are untrained , express himself violently ; especially will he react violently under opposition . But wild and distressing exhibitions must not frighten the mother into thinking that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and therefore frighten her into quickly yielding in the fear that , as one mother expressed it , " the emotions are too powerful for the child 's frame . " What such exhibitions really mean is that the child plainly has no control over his forces , that they get the better of him . An experience I had with a five-year-old boy will be suggestive in a general way of no " MY CHILD IS DISOBEDIENT ? " how to handle a child of this type . This little boy asked a friend and myself to play croquet with him . Before we started the game I gave the little boy the privilege of choosing whatever color mallet he wanted , and he chose the red . The game started , and matters went well for a couple of turns , when all of a sudden the small boy demanded my mallet . Thinking that the handle of his mallet was loose , I suggested that he take the one left in the box . " No ! " He wanted my mallet , nothing else would do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; there was no reason for his having my mallet . I realized at once that here was simply an effort on the child 's part to assert his will , and so I calmly and graciously refused his demand . The little boy , however , was persistent ; he begged and cried , but I was equally persistent in my refusal , and with my friend continued the game undisturbed , ignoring the boy except when his turn came , to which he no longer gave any attention . I also asked my friend not to notice the child , III HOW TO KNOW YOUR CHILD to betray by neither look nor action any signs of sympathy for him . The boy wept louder , shouting out his demand all the time ; and when by this method he did not get my attention he lay down on the ground and kicked his legs in the air . Failing by these tactics to draw us to him , he came to me , and began to tug furiously at my skirt , getting hold of my mallet , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gently as I could I released my mallet from his grasp , and proceeded with my play . Then he got in front of my ball , and before the wicket ; in which cases I removed him bodily , placing him gently out of the way , and went on with my play . Under such painfully trying conditions my friend and I resolutely finished the game , after which we very deliberately put our mallets and balls in the box and went away . This child had developed an exaggerated case of wilfulness . The whole point of my treatment was to prove to the little boy in a concrete way that his wilfulness did not apparently interfere with my happiness , but II2 " MY CHILD IS DISOBEDIENT ? " that it did interfere with his , that he was the sufferer . I realized that behind this trifling incident was a will that , unless disciplined at once , would mean the ruin of the man in him . The next day , when my friend and I were again on the croquet-ground , at an opportune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with us . He did . Each of us picked up the mallet and ball of our choice and the game was played in complete peace and happiness . Though no reference was made to the sad experience of the day before , I knew perfectly well that that child remembered his lesson . As I have said , we must look also into ourselves for the cause of disobedience in our children . There is nothing more common than wilfulness arising from the incredibly inconsistent and indulgent treatment of children , particularly when company is present or is expected . Mothers bribe their children , make all sorts of thoughtless offers , if only the child " promises to be good " in the presence of guests . Through such conduct // the child naturally learns that he can take advantage of the mother , and having such knowledge he acts upon it . The case of the little girl cited by me before , who is obedient at home , where she is kept happily occupied , but who is unmanageable1 when she goes on a visit or for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance where the public wilfulness of the child is primarily the mother 's fault , though I do not say definitely that this mother is to blame . From the description of this little girl , who is happy at home when active , but who misbehaves so in public , she is obviously a child with a good mind , with an active imagination , and with abundant energy . Unless opportunities for the legitimate exercise of these insuppressible qualities are provided , they will very naturally burst out in stubbornness , defiance , and little acts of outlawry . A child alone with adults , and away from its own playthings and workingmaterials , quickly becomes bored unless the parent is a true companion to the child in mind and spirit . All too commonly the I14 " MY CHILD IS DISOBEDIENT ? " parent , when away from home , is preoccupied with her own ideas , or is engaged in a conversation which is unintelligible to the little child , and the child 's questions and interests are overlooked . Then the child explodes , or makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energies . Mere commands to a restless child , under such circumstances , are worse than useless ; they are likely to provoke the child to more violent disobedience , which in turn begets a rising exasperation in the parent ? and the scene grows worse and worse 1 The best way to handle such explosions of defiant will is to see that they never happen . To prevent them the child 's walk or visit should be made truly interesting , by conversation , by exercise , by games . Unless it is unavoidable , a child should not be taken to places which in their nature are overstimulating , or which hold no actual interest or appeal for him . If , however , despite the utmost thoughtfulness on the parent 's part , the child is obstinate or defiant , and ? for instance ? will not go home .115 HOW TO KNOW YOUR CHILD when the time to do so arrives , or will not turn in the right direction , it is , if possible , a great deal wiser to avoid a scene in public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That can be done by taking the child by the hand calmly and quietly , and interesting him in some new idea or new object or new occupation . Such diversions , however , should be resorted to only in emergencies . If practised often , they degenerate the child 's willpower . The child should be helped to meet such situations openly . For instance , if the child 's " disobedience " takes the common form of refusing to go home , then the next time , before you go out to a place to which the child is particularly attracted , say to him that he must understand that when you say it is time to go he is to obey , and that unless he agrees to this condition he can not go at all . And , of course , if he fails to live up to this agreement you must firmly live up to your share of it , and make him sacrifice the next pleasant visit he expected to make to that place , and make him understand that he brought this loss I16 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But in any such procedure as this , you must first be certain that your course is just , and from the beginning you must make sure that the child realizes this . We can hardly conceive of the extent to which disobedience is fostered , and the willpower perverted , by our misunderstanding of our child 's nature , or by our failure sympathetically to appreciate the values the child attaches to this act or that desire . Perhaps in our endeavor strictly to carry out an established rule , or to be what we consider eminently just , we leave out of account the imagination or emotions of the child . A little girl of six , of very strong will , who was just learning to write , conceived the tremendous idea of writing a letter to her father , who was coming home late that evening ? which letter she was going to place beneath his pillow , to be discovered and read by him when he went to bed . The mother , not appreciating what this meant to the child , put the child off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrive until half-past six ; the child 's estab-I17 HOW TO KNOW YOUR CHILD lished hour for being in bed was seven . The little girl dictated to her mother what she wanted to say , and the mother mechanically set down the child 's message . But this was not enough for the child ; she was thrilled with the idea of making the letter the biggest possible surprise , she wanted it to be in her own hand . So with slow , painstaking fingers she began to copy the letter . Her hand grew tired , she grew sleepy , but with unfaltering will she kept on ? for before her was the dream of the pleased surprise of her father as he lifted his pillow . Seven o'clock drew near ; her mother commanded her to stop ; she begged for time , and was given until the stroke of the hour . Seven struck with the letter still unfinished . The mother ordered the child to bed , the child pleaded for time to complete her letter . This the mother flatly refused , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the explosion , the clash . The mother forcibly picked the child up and carried her off , the girl resisting and fighting her mother in a tearful passion of wildest violence . By superior strength the I18 " MY CHILD IS DISOBEDIENT ? " Child was put to bed . Obedience had been enforced , but the little girl lay sobbing in the dark , wild with grief over the tragedy of her broken dream , and her will furiously vibrant with resentment against her mother ? her spirit newly sown with the seed of disobedi-ence ! This violent encounter , this disobedience , and the future disobedience which was here engendered , could all have been avoided if the mother had only understood her child 's nature , and had given the proper consideration to her child 's will . She should have realized the great thing the letter meant to the girl , and should have let her start it in time t ) D finish it , and thus have sent the child to bed happy , and with that healthy growth of the will which comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us remember that good rules are excellent when we master them , but are dangerous when they master us . We must always bear in mind that our requests to our children must be reasonable // ones . If we would have our children obey us , we must deserve their obedience . Disobedience is very often brought on , and the will disordered , through our lack of being simple and straightforward in our dealings with our children . We must state our rules and requests so clearly and with such sincerity that there will be no doubt in the child 's mind as to our attitude and meaning , and so that he will be able to tell when we are serious , and when we are merely playing . The little boy whose mother states that he defiantly says , " No " to all her demands ? this mother , by the way , admits in her letter that she " fooled " with her child too much ? is a victim of just such a bewildering relation . " Why , Felix , what do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roots ? " I heard a mother reprimand her little boy , who came to her with an armful of cosmos still in the bud . " I worked so hard on those flowers ! " " But , mother , " the little boy explained , " I did n't pull all . There are a few left . " I20 " MY CHILD IS DISOBEDIENT ? " The reply of this four-year-old boy , plus the picturesque figure he made in his overalls with that bunch of greens in his hands , made the mother forget almost instantly the seriousness of the deed . " Oh , you are such a funny farmer ! " she exclaimed with a laugh . " Now , run away and do n't be a naughty boy again ! " The boy went back to the cosmos-bed , and literally pulled up every one of the flowers and returned with these to his mother . There followed a terrific scene , although for this second inroad upon the flowers the boy was hardly to be blamed . Disobedience often arises from a lack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . I know a little girl of nine who is very much like the boy whose mother writes that he pays no attention to any request made of him . This little girl had a fall in infancy , and suffered from it during the first four years of her existence . During that period , in order to save her strength and build her up physically , everything was done for her ; nothing was expected I2I HOW TO KNOW YOUR CHILD of her , and even when she grew stronger and had a keen desire to do things for herself , the mother or attendant was instantly on the spot with , " Do n't , Elizabeth ; this is too much for you ? let me do it . " Nobody was allowed to cross her in any way for fear of annoying her . The result of this treatment was that this little child gained robust physical strength , but had no real sense of social obligations or any feeling of responsibility . From the time she was four until she was nine , though in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tasks and household law and the convenience of other persons did not exist . The mother , who came to me for assistance , was in despair about Elizabeth , whom she called inattentive , wayward , wilful , and disobedient . The little girl , it developed , was naturally not at all ungenerous or unkind ; she was just what the indulgent handling of her early years had made her . What she needed was to learn her social responsibilities , through life and by actual practice . A program was planned for I22 " MY CHILD IS DISOBEDIENT ? " her routine life in which her comforts and pleasures depended on herself , in which there were assigned her definite tasks , the failure to perform which resulted automatically in some loss or unpleasantness to herself . The program was not planned with any notion of punishing the child , but with the idea that strict but just discipline would help cultivate and establish in her habits of concentration , attention , and consideration for others , in all of which she was entirely lacking . The task @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy one , and the experiment with Elizabeth is still in progress ; but the results of this new method of handling the child are sufficiently promising to encourage the mother to continue with this plan , and to believe that Elizabeth is being made into a well-balanced girl . Inevitably in our consciousness habit has linked with the word " obedience " the word " punishment . " One hopeful thing that has been revealed by my relations with mothers is that parents are recognizing that // corporal punishment , whether expressed in the form of physical pain actually inflicted , or as an autocratic command which must be obeyed because of the menacing superior force behind it , is failing in its avowed purpose . They are recognizing that " unquestioning obedience " , with behind it the penalty of bodily pain , in almost all cases accomplishes , at the best , only a temporary result ; and that the ultimate and permanent effect is to beget deceit , and engender servility and hatred and viciousness of spirit ; that the ultimate effect is to break or pervert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has a tragic story , writes in her anguish that , " my husband and not my son should have gone to prison . " She describes her nowadult son to have been a child who was mentally alert , spirited , surcharged with physical energy ? all excellent qualities . " But his father was always at him , " writes the mother . The boy 's slightest offense ? his noisy playing , his unexpected laugh , his lateness to a meal , his refusal of a request ? was always met by the father with 124 " MY CHILD IS DISOBEDIENT ? punishment and severest rebuke . The result was that the spirited boy , provoked to rebellion , allied himself with a gang of boys of the wildest type ? and today is paying the penalty of his father-engendered recklessness by a long sentence behind the bars . " But do you believe in physical punishment in any case ? " people ask me . " If not , what do you suggest as a substitute ? " One fundamental objection that I have to physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? for the true object of punishment is not to inflict revenge , but to awaken the child to a sense of his fault , and to arouse in him the desire and determination to do better . Corporal punishment rarely does this . One sometimes hears adults speak of childhood whippings which did them good . Perhaps such people are right , to some extent ; but it is likely that they would have been more improved if some other method of discipline had been used . As a substitute for corporal punishment , which begets only physical pain , and with I25 HOW TO KNOW YOUR CHILD it , usually , a corroding desire for revenge , I would suggest punishment which is aimed at the child 's mind , imagination , emotions , desires . Punishment , to be effective and constructive , and to help develop the child 's will , must be something which the child recognizes could have been avoided by the exercise of his will . Of course any such punishment will have to be varied according to the nature of the child ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study the child before undertaking any action . Perhaps one instance will make clear what I mean by punishment of this kind . A little girl of six , whose unbridled wilfulness I was trying to correct , had a supreme desire for a ring . An inexpensive ring was given to her , with what she knew was very great love ; and it was given to her not as a bribe or a reward , but was expressly given her as a reminder that she should control her will . Further , it was given with her understanding and consent that if she failed to control herself the ring would be forfeited . On the first offense she 126 " MY CHILD IS DISOBEDIENT ? " was to give up the ring for three days ; on the second offense , for a week ; and on the third she was to lose it altogether . The girl realized that the mother 's effort was not to get her to forfeit the ring , but to help her to keep it ; and she realized that if she lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She responded at once to this responsibility which had been put upon her . She did her best to control herself ; but it was hard , and after a period of happy calm she gave way to one of her fits . Her grief was tragic when she had to take her ring from her finger and give it over ; but she understood the conditions and unhesitatingly complied , without the least trace of black feeling against her mother , and blaming herself alone for the punishment which she suffered . She won the ring back by a period of self-control , then had another wilful fit , lost it again , and after a hard struggle regained it once more . She still possesses the ring ? and possesses it , as she clearly recognizes , because she has managed to keep herself under control . This experience // at self-punishment and self-control has been a profound lesson to her , and has been a very definite source of development . We want no parental autocrats in the home , and we want no childish subjects . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ democracy . The ultimate purpose of obedience , of thoughtful discipline , of just and kindly punishment ( inflicted by the child itself whenever possible ) is the establishment of such respect and understanding and harmony between the child and its parents that friction and irritation will be removed , that " obedience , " in its old rigid sense , will become undesirable and obsolete , and that " punishment " inflicted by one in authority will cease to be . The child 's willpower will then have a free and rounded development , with the result that it will be a splendid driving-energy for happiness and achievement which will be always under a perfect self-control . 128 CHAPTER VII UNSPOILING THE SPOILED CHILD " You have told us how to develop the best in our children and how to prevent the growth of what is bad ? but what about the child who is already bad ? I knew nothing about children when I married , and now my oldest child , a boy of eight , is utterly unmanageable . He is ? oh , how I hate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delights in maliciously teasing animals , he is a bully among weaker children , he is impertinent to me . I 'm sure no other mother has such a problem . What can I do to change him ? " This is the substance of an appeal made to me by a frantic mother . This mother was sincere in her despair , but she was mistaken in thinking hers an isolated case . The " spoiled child " is everywhere . My records // are thickly sprinkled with complaints which present variations of this problem . " My child , whenever refused anything , bursts into crying and cries violently until he gets it . " " My little girl demands that I be constantly with her , and every time I try to leave her there is trouble . " " When we have company my boy behaves exactly as he pleases , is rough , or rudely assertive , or does things which he thinks are smart , ' and whenever I have tried to check him he has shamed me by making a frightful scene before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own way , he demands the best of everything , he will play no game unless he is the leader . " And so , on and on go the cases of the " spoiled child " ? and in each case the mother has ended with the same earnest query , " How can my child be made different ? " In part of what I am about to say in the way of an answer , I may seem to be playing too frequently upon one or two strings . But though this may appear to be monotonous , it is a monotony that can not with safety be avoided . The physician , called // in to attend a sudden illness of your child , will take the child 's temperature , examine his pulse , inquire what he has eaten ; and some such preliminary routine he will follow in every new case he is called in to treat , however different may be the diseases . The same liberty of repetition I must also claim . In preceding chapters I have written that the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interfere with his best development is first to examine ourselves to learn , if we have any character-disease which may be a constant source of new infection to the child ; and that if we have , our cure must start with the cure of ourselves . -I Just so , if we would cure our spoiled child , we must begin by looking into ourselves ; the spoiled child usually means a parent who spoiled him . If our child is spoiled , what is there in us that did it ? There may have been any number of things . Perhaps the greatest cause behind the spoiled child is the mother 's unthinking indulgence during the earliest years of the child 's growth , when his habits are forming . The mother // may be unwilling or may shirk to meet directly and frankly the disagreeable situations which arise . Rather than have an open conflict with her child , making clear to him once and for all what is expected of him , and what he can expect from others , the mother too often yields to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demands . Thus , each successful overawing of his mother strengthens the child 's capricious selfishness . Or perhaps the child may have been sickly for a long period , and the mother may have felt that he could not be crossed , and may have arranged the life of the entire family so that it revolved around the child 's life ? and the child may have become aware that he was a little sovereign . In such cases , the cure must be started by the mother 's realization of the injury her policy is doing her child . How one mother was brought to see the seriousness of such a situation as this , and how she handled it , may serve to suggest to other mothers how the tragedy of the spoiled child may be avoided . This mother had a // son of eight , naturally bright and kind , but who unfortunately from birth had suffered from attacks of asthma ; also she had a son of twelve , strong , generous , energetic , and with a keen sense of justice . Because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given the best of physical care , and was shielded by every precaution against over-stimulation . Further , he was allowed to grow up with the understanding that his older brother , David , should yield to him upon all points ? should , in fact , be almost his personal servant . Naturally he made demands on David which were unjust and unreasonable . If David would not at once obey , which sometimes he did not , Sam would instantly begin to cry , which invariably brought the mother to the scene . Fearing dreadful consequences from his irritation , she would put all the blame on David . Frequently , without question , she promptly punished the older boy for bringing on such situations . For a period David received a rebuke and punishment as a matter of fact . He was // subdued by fear into believing in the dreaded consequences that might result from his brother 's illness . But one day when Sam 's crying caused the mother to chastise David for some trivial offense that Sam weepingly announced , and the mother told David @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baseball that afternoon , baseball being his greatest pleasure , David stood for a moment as if dazed by what had happened to him . Then , as if moved by some force outside himself , he flung himself upon his little brother and pommeled him with all his boyish strength . A scene followed between the mother and David which need not be described here ; but David finally managed to express the injustice of the whole situation . Then he declared that he would not stand his mother 's treatment or his brother 's tyranny another day ? he would run away from home . The mother , in an awakened agony for David , for the first time began to see what was happening ? that little Sam was being made into a selfish prig , and that , as // serious as was his physical ' trouble , even more serious would it be for him to grow up a spiritual cripple . The mother decided then and there that , despite Sam 's physical condition , he was never again to have his way , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that from that day on , unless he could play justly and fairly , unless he could give as well as take in his play , he could not play with his brother ; and since his physical condition did not permit him to play freely at large , he would have to play all by himself in a single room at home . This program was strictly adhered to . The first time the mother discovered that Sam was unfair and selfish in his play , she took him right out of the game and put him in a room entirely by himself . Sam was astonished at this change in his mother 's attitude and protested violently . The mother , though fearful of results , let him protest without changing her decision , and soon Sam learned that his mother was in earnest . Several such unpleasant experiences absolutely cured Sam of his habit // physically injured , a child cries solely to attract attention . When he perceives that his crying is getting him no attention , he wearies of the performance . After a few such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she says , and that his crying will bring no results , and he will shortly give up this unpleasant practice . A chief point to remember in this connection is that you must prove to your child , in your everyday relationship with him , that what is reasonable and right for him to have , he shall have , and that what is wrong or harmful for him to have , he can not have under any circumstances . You must strive to establish in the child a perfect confidence in your sense of justice . And this confidence you can hope to secure only by first giving adequate thought as to what really are the child 's rights . The type of " spoiled child " who is destructive , who delights in teasing animals or engaging in malicious michief , is generally a child whose mental , nervous , or physical energy has not been constructively // utilized or directed . Therefore his energy escapes in malicious and destructive activities . Back of all his " spoiledness " there may be only , or chiefly , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and constructive outlet for his natural energy . " Joe is impossible to have around the house , he is so incorrigibly mischievous ! " a mother complained to me . " He simply takes the house apart ! He meddles with every clock , lock , or screw , and we never know what awful thing is going to happen next . " To illustrate , she told me of an unpleasant experience the family had had on account of Joe 's wicked mischievousness in the early fall , when the steam had first been turned on . It seemed to them for a while as if the whole house was going to be blown up , for steam was escaping everywhere . Joe calmly came forward and announced that he knew what was the matter , that he had unscrewed certain valves to see what would happen , and that he knew how to fix those valves . This , to the // mother 's great surprise , he did . " And , " concluded the mother , " I fixed Joe , to help him remember not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very plain that what this " spoiled child " needed was not punishment or suppression of his mechanical inclinations , but a chance to make use of them . I advised the mother to have Joe join a mechanical class in a boys ' club-house in the neighborhood . I knew that in connection with that class the boys also had gymnastic instruction under a competent leader . This proved to be exactly what Joe needed . He found great pleasure in his new classroom , he learned the use of certain mechanical devices there , and before very long Joe , instead of being an annoyance to everybody , became a very genuine source of pride to the household . He had a corner in the house which he called his " shop " , whence emanated all kinds of original and ingenious mechanical toys . The child who maliciously teases animals does it perhaps out of idleness , or because // he has never been trained or taught to treat animals kindly , or because he has seen those about him careless and unkind to animals . Little children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are cruel . Kindness and sympathy for animals can best be developed in children through actual personal experiences . Every little child should have a chance , and should be required to care for some living , growing thing , animal or plant . Only through such practices can the finer human sympathies and instincts in the child be awakened and developed . The desire and the habit in a child to tease others is often the direct result of that child 's home environment . It is among the commonest of parents ' sins to tease their little children . I do not need to suggest particulars here ; most of us can supply them from our own experience . These thoughtless practices on the parents ' part are wicked , and it must be expected that wicked practices will yield wicked fruit . // The " spoiled child " whose outstanding trait is that he is a bully , has usually been made so by indulgence and over-protection , and by lack of active life among his equals . The small bully , like the grown-up bully , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as good as he is . This small bully has usually been made self-conscious and selfcentered by over-attention paid to his cute , childish pranks and expressions . He is the boy who usually boasts of all the wonderful things he can do . He can go into the cold sea up to his neck , yet in actual performance will begin to lose courage when the water reaches his waist . He can climb up the highest tree , and in reality he is afraid to go beyond the first branches . This sort of boy usually manages to play with children younger and weaker than himself , which he should never be allowed to do if he is to be saved the humiliation of growing up into a cad and a coward . Perhaps the rather severe method one wise father used in curing his little boy of this most undesirable trait will be sug- // gestive to others of how to handle their problem . This wise father , when his nineyear-old Jim returned from a summer in the country , realized that his boy had been playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had learned to take advantage of them . The father made it his business to get Jim to play with a group of good , strong , clean boys of his own strength . The father prepared himself for the worst , and was not disappointed . At the end of the first afternoon , the boy returned home with a black eye , blubbering of the terrible things that had been done to him , and naturally expecting his father 's sympathy and attention . But , to Jim 's surprise , the father did not seem one little bit upset or concerned , nor did he seem over-sympathetic . To the boy 's complaints the father calmly replied : " Doubtless , Jim , you deserved what you got . I hope it will help you to remember to behave decently and honorably the next time you play with your friends . " Continued contact with this group of his 143 a HOW TO KNOW YOUR CHILD equals soon cured the boy of his habits of boasting , intimidation , and unfairness . The variety of spoiled child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps the reason for his bad manners in company is the lack of cultivation of good manners in his everyday home life . Or perhaps the child has learned that his parents , for the sake of keeping up appearances , will avoid meeting an issue in the presence of guests ; and the child uses this knowledge to take any liberties he chooses . Or perhaps , while entertainment in plenty has been provided for his elders , none has been provided for him , and he is supposed to sit quietly and mannerly through an affair whose every moment bores him . This last is a point worth dwelling upon . If you do n't wish your child to develop this particular sort of " spoiledness " , then first of all strive to make courtesy , kindness , and thoughtfulness the standard of his everyday behavior ; and second , when company is present , provide for the child an occupation which will prove more interesting than mis- // behaving before the family friends . I know mothers who make it a point , when they plan to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon for their children . If the mother has room in her own house , she invites one or two of the child 's small friends to play with him . Otherwise , she arranges for him to visit a little friend away from home . Children should , as far as possible , be spared from attendance at any grown-up entertainment , for they can not possibly share in it with any benefit to themselves . They are always over-stimulated , often taken advantage of , frequently used for the grownups ' pleasure , and usually the little child pays for it by a nervous reaction . Perhaps there is no type of spoiled child more obnoxious than the child who is an autocratic egotist , who always wants the best of everything , who always forces himself forward , who takes first place by his mere self-assertiveness . I hardly need say that I do not include here the child who wins prominence by his merit , or is chosen to // leadership by the free action of his fellows . This child , beneath his obnoxiousness , may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he is in certain danger as he grows to maturity of using his strength , his initiative , and his powerful personality for selfish and ruthless ends , which will be injurious to those about him and fatal to the larger , person he might have been . To unspoil this type of child is not easy , but it can be accomplished if the method of treatment is consistently applied . The foundation of this treatment is to place the child upon a par with other children and to maintain this attitude firmly . Never accept any of his assumptions of superiority , and even ignore him whenever possible . A child of such a character naturally needs strict supervision in his play ? in fact , in all his social relationships . The person or persons closest to him , his family in particular , should see that in no way does he get any but his fair chance to lead or to be prominent . In his play with other children // he should not be allowed to lead except when his turn comes naturally . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets only the attention that is due to him . At the table he should be required to await his turn , and in all his home relations he should be taught that he is only one member of the family , and has no rights superior to any other member 's . Ample time must be allowed for this kind of child to gain his balance , and great care should be taken not to remind him continually of his egotism , not to shame him with it , not to " throw it up to him . " This course will only embitter him and may even stimulate him to be more domineering . Even while we are trying to hold our strict attitude toward him , we must remember to treat him with utmost consideration and justice . We want to be sure to preserve all the power of personality and all the true quality of leadership that he may possess . In handling this problem , we must frankly recognize from the start that , serious and difficult as it is to train a child to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correctly in the child 's infancy , it is not nearly so difficult as is the task of unspoiling the spoiled child . Here , first of all , must come the eradication of the bad habits , which often are deeply rooted . Only after we have started eradication can we begin the sowing and cultivation of the desirable new habits . This means double work , it means double time , it requires even more sympathy , intelligence , and application than does the right training of the little child from the beginning . In giving this frank warning to mothers , I have no desire to frighten or discourage them . On the contrary , I wish to prepare them for their serious task , and to stimulate them to keep up their courage and to persist , even though they do not see immediate results . Mothers facing the problem of a spoiled child must realize that results can not be wrought by magic , that they will come slowly and only through hard work . Attacking the problem with determination and patience , and expecting little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother need have no doubt that in the end she will remake her child , save him from his present faults , and bring out the very best there is in him . // THE PERSON YOUR CHILD MIGHT BE " TEN years I have struggled to get hold of myself ? and now look at me ! " she said with throbbing bitterness . " I am a wreck , a failure , an utter failure , and my life is nothing but misery . " " You a failure ! " I exclaimed in some wonderment , for she was fortunately placed as far as worldly circumstances were concerned . " What can have made you a failure ? " " My mother ! " she cried . " I have my own mother to thank for it all ! My mother always said that she did everything for me to make me happy . Indeed , she did do everything for me ? everything to make me the person she wanted me to be . She gave me every material indulgence , gave me everything except a chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; somehow never understood me . To escape , to gain freedom to what I craved to be , I married ? and married without love and without thinking what marriage should mean . At twenty-nine I am the most miserable woman in the world ! " My friend spoke truly of her present self ; her life indeed was a failure . And yet , as I came to know her better , and in imagination could look back and see her as a child , I perceived that this twisted , embittered young woman had been rich in the natural gifts which should make a normal , happy , useful being . Her tragedy is all the greater and more poignant because she realizes that it could have been avoided if only her personality had been discovered and understood and allowed normal development . She is now physically and nervously too disorganized , and her habits of work are too deranged , for her ever to piece her broken life together into the admirable whole it might have been . It takes a person of very unusual physical energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad train- // ing or no training and remake himself or herself into a strong , well-balanced person . This young woman 's broken life is one of many similar cases that have come under my professional observation : cases where the parents , through ignorance , or laziness , or soul-blindness , or belief in one formula for dealing with all children , or plain unawareness of their opportunity , had never looked for the person their child might have become ? cases , as far as great development is concerned , in which the only comment that can now be made is " too late . " But this same method of handling infants and children , and this same blindness to great opportunities , exists today , and with today 's children it is not too late . The finding the person that is in the child , and the development of that person , is the great problem to which we must here address ourselves . At the very start of our training of our children ? and here is the foundation of all I shall say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that every human being , from his birth , is a distinct individual with // his own peculiar gifts , traits and qualities ; with a something distinctly his own , a something which should make him in some degree different from everybody else . To a great extent , the effect of school training and home training has been to destroy this best essence of the child ; has been to make children more or less alike . Such a course is wrong ; it fails to make the most of our children ; a child so trained is , in a manner of speaking , a factory product ? one of thousands or millions who have been turned out on a standardized pattern . A child whose personality is discovered , and whose personality has been given or allowed well-rounded development , is an infinitely bigger and more useful embryonic adult than would the same child be had he been turned out on the factory plan . He is himself , and all of himself ; he has something fresh ( perhaps not big ) to give to life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course I hardly need say that when I speak of your child 's personality , I do not refer to outstanding manifestations of character which may be merely over-grown faults // ? such as egotism , smartness , a domineering spirit . We must be careful not to mistake over-developed faults for the child 's great strengths ? though of course those faults may be symptoms of good qualities or may indeed be good qualities that have been perverted . " But how can I discover the person my child might be ? " parents will inquire . This question represents the first great step in our endeavor . No blanket answer , covering all cases , can be given this query . We must realize that every child is a separate question and has a different answer . That answer can only be found in thoughtful observation of the individual child . We must watch , and study , and be most careful ; and even after we think we have made the discovery , we must not proceed along rigid , unchanging lines . Our policy must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and for the appearance of new qualities in the child . But here are a few hints as to how , through observation , you may seek the answer to this // question yourselves . To consider only a few traits , and here I am citing some that are considered undesirable ? is your child irresponsible , inattentive , careless in small details , does he at times seem uninterested in the ordinary things about him ? Ask yourself what , deep down , these traits may mean , and what may be their cause . Mistakenly , you may ascribe this behavior to laxness of mind , or even stupidity ; but these symptoms may mean that the person in your child is dominated by imagination ? and imagination , whatever else in the course of your training you may seek to add to it , is the quality that will contribute most to this child 's growth and usefulness . Is your child impulsive , impatient , of a violent temper ? Again you must go far beneath these surface symptoms . This behavior may mean that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' spiritual gift when properly developed and brought under the child 's control . Is your child contrary , obstinate , rebellious , habitually disobedient ? This may mean that // your child has initiative , and an original , independent mind ? invaluable gifts which enable the child to discover things for himself and makes him resent thoughtless rules , purposeless prohibitions and routine answers that he recognizes as superficialities or evasions . Such unpleasant manifestations may be no more than the natural results of the repression or improper handling of such a personality . Perhaps I can best indicate the mistakes we make in our children , and can best suggest how to find the person in your child and how to develop it , by giving two or three cases that have come under my observation in the course of my professional practice , where an attempt has been made to help the child be itself and be the best of itself . I may here state that there is no better way and no better place for studying the little child than in his own home and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not say too often that it is the daily routine existence that is the greatest influence and factor in the young child 's life , and if we really want to // understand the child it is in his own world that we must observe him . " I wish you would tell me what makes my Heloise so nervous and so irritable , " a distracted mother asked me . " I try in every way to please her by giving her things and doing things for her , I try to keep her calm and avoid scenes with her ? her nurse does everything for her ? yet she can not be pleased ? she pinches , kicks , throws things at us ? we never know what she is going to do next . I even had her examined by a physician , but he could find nothing wrong with her . " In Heloise 's home I found the attitude towards the child exactly what her mother had described . Both the mother and the nurse , a faithful , precise , kindly woman , anticipated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's toilette was typical of her whole existence and all that surrounded her : it was perfection itself , even to the curls which were carefully put into curl papers every night . The nursery was large , airy , attractive , filled with materials and toys kept in most precise order ; but they were as // inaccessible to the child 's hands and interest as her nurse 's well-intentioned , dried-up imagination was to the little girl 's soul . There was nothing in that room Heloise could take or do without the faithful nurse being at her elbow giving it to her or offering help in some way . Though my particular business was to study Heloise , I took great pains at first apparently to pay no attention whatever to her . I did not , as is so commonly done by adults , force myself upon the child or try to make artificial or conventional conversation with her . I waited for the opportunity to find a point of common interest between us ; once I had that , I knew we would become friends , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the imagination and the grace to understand her . While I apparently paid no attention to Heloise , I watched her every act and expression , and the most trivial acts told me , as they can tell every student of little children , the story of the child 's make-up . At luncheon I noticed that while Heloise 's table manners were conventionally good ? // she handled her fork , knife and spoon properly , sat up straight and was extremely neat in taking her food ? she ate without pleasure ; she was spiteful in little matters ; she refused to eat certain things and to comply with certain requests , it seemed , for the sheer pleasure of doing the opposite of what was asked of her . Heloise gave the impression that at any moment she was likely to explode ; and I felt the tense fear of the nurse and mother of the gunpowder of the child 's " nervousness . " Later I had a chance to observe Heloise at play in her perfect nursery . There , as at the table , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rebellion rather than to use them in happy , constructive expression . She would demand half a dozen things at a time , which were handed to her promptly and graciously by her nurse ; she would look at a box of blocks , upset them ? perhaps start stringing beads and do that for a few minutes ? then take her colored crayons , scrawl over a few pieces of paper ? then go for the next thing . And so on , getting no value or pleasure out // of her playthings and continually growing more irritated with them and with the nurse and mother . This behavior suggested to me what was the real person behind this unpleasant child , and also what was the matter . A later experience confirmed my impression and gave me the key to the girl 's character . After Heloise and I became better acquainted , I invited her to play in my play-group ? an informal organization under my direction where children play freely and independently under the guidance of a director who makes it her business to be just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found herself at home in it , keenly enjoying its freedom ; she played with abandon , yet was gracious and kind and was responsive to the chief rule of the group , " equal opportunity of pleasure and play for all . " This playing brought out qualities in her entirely unrevealed in her home life . Everything went pleasantly until toward the end of the afternoon when her nurse appeared to take her home . Suddenly the delightful , exuberant , playful spirit in 16o THE PERSON YOUR CHILD MIGHT BE Heloise turned into passionate fury . At the sight of the nurse she stamped her foot and screamed , " I will not go with you ! ? I do n't like you ? go away ! " And not having any weapon in her hand with which to strike , she spat at her . I tried to get hold of Heloise 's unbounded anger . At first she could hardly speak . Every nerve in the little body was tense . I did not meet passion with passion ? the common error . I took her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her in an even voice , quietly and slowly ; and finally I managed to calm her , and she told me why she treated her nurse as she did . " She is a wicked , wicked woman ? she watches me all the time ! " was the significant explanation . To diagnose this case , to discover who the person in Heloise really was , was now simple enough . Here was , as her conduct in the free atmosphere of my play-group had shown me , an original , energetic , imaginative little child of unusual strength , with a keen desire to make use of her powers , to be active and // self-dependent . But she was tied hand and foot , was locked in chains ? golden chains , to be sure , but chains none the less . It was in her natural effort to free herself from them that she struck out indiscriminately ; her kicking , biting , pinching , her nervousness and irritability , were merely inevitable reactions , and were the child 's undisciplined protests against her guarded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the true person in her , and this I am happy to state her mother was quick to perceive , was just a normal opportunity to use her energies in constructive , active experiences . A program was arranged which allowed the child to use her powers and to be dependent upon herself . In an astonishingly short time the agonizing , mysterious irritability and nervousness were removed by giving a suitable outlet to the energies behind them and by establishing a simple , sympathetic , cooperative relationship in her home life ; and Heloise was started on the road to being herself . In trying to discover the person our child // might be , not only must we observe the child in his own natural activites , but we should put materials and activities in his way to choose from , to afford him new opportunities through which he can express his interests and reveal himself . Perhaps the record of how one child through the patient , thoughtful work of his teacher barely escaped from being relegated to the hopeless mass of the dull and weak-minded , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a warning to those of us who are careless and may bring hope to many parents . Jack is ten years old . He was a problem to his mother from the time he emerged from infancy , when he could be managed through his mere helplessness . He was a problem at school from the day he entered it . He was backward in all the routine work of the class-room ; he was promoted from one class into the other chiefly because each teacher in turn wanted to get rid of him , and because , though he did work inferior to the youngest in his class , he was from two to three years older than the oldest in that class . The // chief complaints against him were that he was listless , indifferent , uninterested in his work . He gave the impression that " he was not there . " One teacher said , " It would have been far easier for me to handle him if he were actually bad rather than colorless and negative . " His parents were in despair about him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mother frankly told the teacher that she realized what a task Jack was , and that if he did not improve after a fixed period she would take him out of school and place him in an institution for backward children . This particular teacher , however , happened to be one who took a special interest in the problem child . Instead of accepting him on his reputation of being stupid , dull , lazy , indifferent , she made it her business really to find out for herself what was the matter . One of her methods for studying the children in her class was to give them a period in which they could freely express themselves . One day she chose a half dozen children to entertain the entire class in their own original way . // Jack was one of the six selected . On the appointed day every child in turn did his little stunt ; some jumped a rope , others acted as circus clowns , still others recited bits of verse . Jack , to the utter astonishment of the teacher and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poem with many words that to him were unpronounceable . The teacher in a casual manner asked Jack what it was that he liked best about the poem . The boy , with what sounded like enthusiasm from this almost expressionless being , answered , " I love the birds and flowers in it . " This was the first time , after many weeks of effort , that the teacher had secured an expression from Jack showing a definite interest in anything . This was the first hint that Jack might care for Nature . From that day the teacher made it her business to pay particular attention to Jack during the Nature Study hour , when a special teacher of the subject was in charge of the class . She noticed that Jack paid more attention during that hour to what was said and done than during any other period , but the Nature // Study teacher , having been led to expect no response from Jack , made no effort to get any from him and so the boy was practically left to himself . Shortly after that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the park . Without making her attention too conspicuous she carefully observed Jack . Jack changed into a different child ; here he was in his element ; he came right out of his shell ; he was alive to everything ; he noticed every bird , every flower , he was interested in every bug ; he asked questions , intelligent , live questions . Right there and then the mystery of this stupid boy was solved for his teacher . The world other people had been forcing him to live in was not a live world for him , hence his indifference to it . But this nature world was a live world , and his soul responded quickly and readily to it ; he was sensitive to all its colors , forms and sounds . From that time the teacher adopted a new course with Jack . Instead of demanding that he maintain the average standard of the routine work in the class-room , she made his // particular gift and interest contribute toward his own and the class 's development . She made him responsible for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything that interested him , and soon the class-room had its little museum of natural history . Soon this Jack , who had been the slow-wit of his class , became a high light in it , bringing into it new life and new interest . The teacher , who had discovered the real Jack , won his complete friendship , and through her understanding of him she was able to make an appeal to him to take an interest even in the subjects which had been uninteresting to him . When I last saw the teacher she was filled with admiration for Jack ? " I truly believe that Jack has the makings of a genius in him . " His general progress by the end of the year was so great that he was ready to be promoted two classes instead of one . I wish to drive home , even at the danger of repetition , that if there is one place where we parents sin cruelly against our children ? and this sin may be almost as bad as utter // neglect of the child ? it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even forcing , our children to become what we would like them to become , rather than trying to find out what they are best fitted for , and letting them develop accordingly ? in trying to mould them into the shape we would like them to assume , rather than in allowing them to develop into the shape Nature intended them to have . No matter from what motive we bring this pressure upon our children , even though that motive be love , disaster in some degree , a loss of what might have been , is sure to follow . For the development of the person in your child , once that person is known , no fixed rule can be laid down . Again the method must be adapted to every child ; again the procedure is up to the good sense of the parent . But while there is no method for all , there is one principle for all : and that is to give the child a normal outlet for his individual qualities , and free access to whatever may help him . Combined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be training // and discipline of the qualities in which the child may be weak ; for while we want the best in our child saved and developed to its very highest , we do not want a lop-sided child ; we do not want a child who is powerful and positive in just one aspect , and helpless and negative in all others . I do not mean to imply that every seemingly stupid child is a misjudged genius ; nor do I mean to suggest that every seemingly clever child is an embryonic person of rare talents . Our primary business is not to make geniuses ? though incidentally as the result of our efforts we may , and probably will , increase their number by saving those who otherwise would go to waste through never having been understood and through never having been given the opportunities that fitted their natures . Our primary business is to develop persons ; persons who , as I have said , are themselves and not mere duplicates of other children ; persons in whom the individual quality has been cultivated to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discharge our high duty as parents ; and as // for the children , the result will be a generation in which each child is of more value and a source of greater happiness to himself , to his parents , and to the world in which he lives . // A NEW VISION OF PLAY THE great room was a palace of glittering magic . Color was everywhere , a hundred bewildering shades ? and in miniature there were all the creatures of the world it seemed , in the shapes nature had given them , or in shapes grotesquely distorted to provoke a laugh . Indians , Esquimaux , hairy Russians , Dutchmen with globular abdomens ; great St. Bernard dogs , horses , camels , elephants , sheep , crocodiles , brilliant lizards . And dolls ! ? a veritable congregation of all the highbred beauties of the world , with dazzling toilettes , and with boudoir and bedroom sets of gilt or mahogany . That toy-shop seemed a thrilling monument to the tender thoughtfulness of the twentieth century for the child . Just ahead of me a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Their attention wavered , and finally centered on what might perhaps be termed as Act I ? a plaster of paris cabbage tinted a very stagey garden green . The clerk twisted a key , a music box in the cabbage 's interior struck up a tinkling overture ? and then , Act II , from the centre of the cabbage there slowly arose a white rabbit . For a moment he stood upright , with staring pink eyes ? and then , Act III , to the toy orchestration of the musicbox , the rabbit slowly sank from sight back into the cabbage head . The music stopped . The play was over . " Very amusing , and very ingenious , " persuasively remarked the clerk-showman . The woman turned to her husband , her eyes warm with a young mother 's affection . " I do think it will amuse Jim a lot , " she said . " Yes , it is clever , " admitted the husband . " I guess it will help keep the boy out of mischief for a while . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but turn the key , " deftly put in the salesman . The cabbage was wrapped up , its price I72 A NEW VISION OF PLAY was paid down , and the loving parents hurried from the bewildering toy-shop homeward with ' their prize ? to Jim , who was going to be " amused , " and " kept out of mischief , " all by the mere turning of a key . An hour after I had witnessed this purchase ? such a purchase , with just such affectionate motives , as is being made at something like the rate of a thousand per minute in this country ? I was taking tea with an acquaintance whose little girl of five was playing in the same room . The child was prodigally supplied with toys and play materials , many of them excellent , but she was constantly running to her mother with interruptions . " Oh , Nellie , " besought the irritated mother , " wo n't you play with your things and let me have a little peace ! " " But I 'm tired of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside and play . " " I do n't know what to play . " " Oh , play anything ? only run along and give me a little rest ! " These two little scenes , the commonest of commonplaces in themselves , fitted together // in my mind to form a significant whole . And that whole was in the nature of a great tragedy of child life . That whole was an almost complete exemplification of the average loving parent 's conception of the purpose and possibilities of play . That whole presented the present vision of play . Play is to amuse the child . Play is to keep the child out of mischief . Play is to give the parent relief . Yes , here is a tragedy ? a tragedy that disturbs most of us not at all , because we are not conscious of its existence : the tragedy of splendid forces and magnificent opportunities , unrecognized , non-understood , that are unconsciously allowed to go to waste . Play can and should serve all the above-mentioned purposes . But it should and can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's play instinct , together form one of the most valuable instruments at our command for the allaround development of the child . It is easy enough to offer criticisms upon our present play . We need better and more sensible play materials , to be sure ; we need // the annihilation of the gaudy , degenerating rubbish that comprises three-quarters of the stock of the toy-shops ; we need more intelligent methods of using existing material ; and so one might go on , for a page or more . But what we need most of all , and first of all , because it is fundamental to all else , is a new vision of play on the parents ' part , a new attitude toward play , a new conception of the tremendous possibilities that , unsuspected by the majority , are inherent in play . The first step toward acquiring this new vision of play is an understanding of the needs and qualities and opportunities of childhood . I must be forgiven for dealing here and elsewhere in commonplaces ; my excuse must be that much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to discovering a new significance in , or a better use for , matters which hitherto we have neglected or but half used . I know I am stating a commonplace when I say that the entire waking-time of the young child born in decent circumstances , save the time devoted to eating and dressing , is usually given to play ; that is , // ' from six to nine hours a day during four or five years the sole business of the child is play . The kindergarten , even in the case of the child who attends it , concerns itself with but a fraction of this time . As I have said elsewhere , if one period of human life can be arbitrarily marked off as richer in possibilities than any other , these early years constitute that period . This is the time when the child 's faculties are having their most rapid development , when its interests , fresh and vivid , are reaching out in every direction . Yet during this period all that is usually offered the child is play that engages only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is no more than play , and play that is often a great deal less , or worse . And so opportunities , potentialities , are lost that never can be regained . And this because affectionate parents have never recognized the larger and richer mission of play . Before going farther I wish to make plain that I do not undervalue play , nor the pleasure that it gives . On the contrary , I wish to // emphasize the importance of play ; I would add every atom of pleasure to the child 's life that I could . But the pleasure given by play , the outlet it affords to the child 's animal energies , the opportunities it offers for its physical development ? these are functions of play that are generally recognized and accepted , and upon them I shall not dwell . It is with play 's unrecognized values and possibilities , which constitute the new vision of play , that I shall deal . The parent , to acquire a clear sense of the larger mission of play , must understand two things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are budding and growing so rapidly at this period ; second , the play materials which can be used effectively to develop these qualities . Of these two , the vastly more irnportant is knowing the child . Only through a sympathetic understanding of the child , of the qualities and traits it is beginning to exhibit , can we get an intelligent idea of what play can do for it . Curiosity , imagination , initiative , self-dependence ? one could enumerate an almost // endless list of qualities that must be looked for and cared for in connection with the child 's play . Of these the most common and perhaps the most promising is curiosity . Few things are so important to the child 's future as keeping his curiosity alive , for curiosity is the foundation of interest , of observation , of constructive sense . And yet few other qualities are so little understood and appreciated , and so frequently repressed . How curiosity and imagination ( and in the same way other qualities ) are too often stifled , and how they can be made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a three-year-old boy who for a time was under my observation . His mother , who was affectionate and desired the best for him , complained to me that the boy gave her no peace , that he took no interest in his games , that he was destructive . I studied him for a time , and saw that upon the surface the mother 's complaint seemed entirely true . A game would hold his attention but a moment or two ; he would not play alone ; he was clumsy in his play ; and ( for example ) he would half complete formless // piles out of his blocks only to send the structure flying with a petulant kick . Further observation of the boy and conversation with the mother made clear to me that the mother , loving as she was , had , like too many mothers , given no serious thought to the child 's curiosity and imagination . His questions had been considered a nuisance ? or considerd as " smart " and laughed at ? or answered lightly , evasively and often untruthfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been stifled ; play could not hold him because play had no meaning for him . After this , I spent considerable time with the boy . I tried to animate his repressed curiosity ; and soon we were constantly having conversations like the following , which burst on me one day out of a clear sky : " Do horses sleep ? " " Yes , Fred , " I answered . " Do they sleep in houses ? " " In horses ' houses , " I answered . " Do dogs sleep in houses ? " " In dogs ' houses , " I answered . " Do birds have houses ? " // " Yes , " I answered , " Birds ' houses ? nests , we call them when the birds make them . " " Tell me who else has houses , " he demanded . And I mentioned the cow , the hen , the squirrel , the rabbit , and other animals familiar to him . Fred became intensely amused in this game of questions and answers . His interest quickened almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stable . Here I allowed him to notice things for himself ; guidance is desirable , but the child finds most pleasure in , and is most deeply impressed by , the things which he himself discovers . In this visit we learned where the horse is dressed to go out ; where he sleeps and eats ; we noticed how he gets light and air into his house . Another day we visited dog-kennels . The first time we went for a day in the country we visited barns , chickenruns , looked at pig-sties and rabbit-holes . Soon after these visits I noticed a decided change in Fred 's playing with his ordinary , unpainted , wooden building-blocks ? the same blocks with which he had before shown a clumsy , impatient inability to do anything . 18o A NEW VISION OF PLAY Here is a material which is used almost in every household , with practically no realization of the possibilities it holds for the development of the child . Instead of endless tracks which come from nowhere and lead to nowhere ; instead of meaningless piling of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stables , barns , kennels , farm-houses grew up beneath Fred 's hands . At first these were very crude ; often important details were omitted ; but these omissions were always corrected , by the child himself . I recall one incident when Fred built a really complete stable - floor , walls , windows , gable-roof , and manger ? but left out the door . He called me with great pride to see what he had built . I expressed my approval , but asked him to excuse me for a moment until I returned . In another room I quickly cut out a horse from a magazine advertisement , led him in to Fred by a string , and asked him if he would keep the horse in his stable overnight . Fred was delighted with this idea . He took the horse from me and led him up to the stable . // " Why , the stable has no door ! " he cried , laughing at the discovery of his mistake . After this , there were no more " houses " built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months after that , when I came upon Fred who was just finishing an intricate arrangement of his wooden buildingblocks . For a moment I looked puzzled . " Makin ' my house , " Fred volunteered in a matter-of-fact way . I looked more closely ; and then I perceived that the child had in fact constructed a miniature flat modelled upon the one in which he lived . He had the entire plan correct , the hallway with the exact number of rooms opening from it ; the exact number of windows in each room , and the correct positions of all the doors . Some of the doors were opened at an angle to show that they worked on hinges , and some were thrust apart to show that they ran on rollers . Tables , beds , and couches were in their proper places ; in fact , not a single large detail of the apartment was missing . This change in Fred was due solely to one // thing , a changed attitude towards his childish faculties and toward his play . His faculties had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural expression . In consequence , his meaningless play had become meaningful to him ; it engrossed his interest for long periods ; it stimulated his observation , imagination , power of construction . Play had become a real instrument for his development . And to achieve such a result , there is no need to turn the child 's world topsy-turvy . And there is no need for elaborate and costly paraphernalia . The chief requirement is to make intelligent use of the materials already existing and which are easily within the reach of a modest income . In so far as this proposal is a revolution it is merely taking time and faculties ordinarily neglected , and commonplace materials , and putting this waste , these commonplaces , to a great constructive use . Play and the play spirit have great possibilities as a corrective of the faults of children ; but one must of course be certain that the trait or behavior is in reality a fault , and // one must of course be able to perceive what variety of play will best aid in such correction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play far more easily than through punishment . Disobedience is as often the expression of a physical disorder as of a moral one ; and this physical disorder can be corrected by training . During some period when the mother is with the child , preferably not at the end of the afternoon , the mother can improvise a game whose point is to see how quickly the child can change from doing one thing to doing another , how promptly he can obey commands or signals . For instance , the mother can say in order : Fly , run , skip , hop , jump , walk , bend , bow , walk on tiptoes , etc . The child is made most happy by this game provided the mother enters into it in a spirit of real play . The child then can be asked to give commands , and of course the mother should faithfully obey the child . This playful method gives the child an opportunity for exercise in the coordination of his mind and of his body , and in a surprisingly short time it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly and as promptly and as willingly as he does the commands given in this game . But it should be held as a foremost thought , here and in all dealings with the child , that an order or request given a child must be a reasonable one . For if the child recognizes the request as unreasonable , he will rebel , disobedience will be fomented , and defiance will be developed instead of the harmony that should exist between parent and child . Loudness of speech and unnecessary noisiness in walking and behavior can be corrected through some forms of what might be termed " quiet play . " " Close your eyes , Billy , until you hear the ball strike the floor , " you may say ; and while Billy 's eyes are closed you can walk softly to the opposite side of the room . You drop the ball , Billy opens his eyes , and he is astonished at how you got there so quietly . After this , you close your eyes and let Billy show how quietly he can go through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which children so readily fall into , the first step toward the // correction of this really very disagreeable habit is never to talk or call loudly yourself . Here again some improvised silent game may be used . " Can you hear me , Billy ? " you say very softly . " Bring me the red book from the table . " This Billy does ; after which you say : " Now ask me something , very , very softly , and see if I can understand . " He whispers his request , and you straightway march off and do the thing ? to the great glee of Billy . When Billy is afterwards unnecessarily noisy , a playful reminder of how nicely he had walked and talked in that game , which rouses in him the desire to do as well as he then did , will do far more for the child than a rebuke . These are of course merely suggestions ; the invention of the mother will easily supply dozens of other methods . But , to repeat , the aim of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We must start on the principle that we can make doing a thing right just as much fun to the child as doing it wrong . Play , more than anything else , can help // to develop the child 's social instinct : fairness , kindness , unselfishness . It can teach the child the value of material and labor , it can give him a sense of orderliness and fitness , and incidentally the child will not lack in manners , not the manners that one associates with sashes and stiffly starched little skirts and Johnnie 's uncomfortable collars , but that genuine behavior which springs from a sincere appreciation of the rights of others , the " manners " which are a part of the child 's character and not something " put on " for special occasions . Play and the play instinct can be made a most valuable instrument for giving the child a keen but perfectly normal interest in those subjects which we usually classify under the head of " primary education . " Not that I desire to encourage a forced growth of prodigies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I feel somewhat inclined to the view of a little boy friend of mine whose father was reading to him from Evelyn 's Diary about that marvellous child , young Evelyn , who at six could read Latin , Greek , French and who at seven // died in the ripeness of scholarship . " Oh , father , " cried my little friend , clapping a hand to his forehead , " is n't it awful to have a brain that hurts like that ! " It is the well-developed normal child that we are interested in ; but our average children are far from being developed up to their normal capacities . The average child , long before it is of school age , can secure through the employment of its play instinct a fair start in reading , writing , and drawing and can find these occupations as pleasurable as any other form of play . On the day that I am writing this , it so chanced , an acquaintance lunched with me . When a child under my charge , aged four , had finished eating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announced , " And now I must paint . " In a perfectly independent matter-of-course manner she put on her overalls with a high bib , moved a small light table to the window , got out her drawing materials and water-colors , and in a few quick strokes sketched ( very crudely , of course ) a woman she saw passing across the // street . She laid aside pencil and with her paints she then blocked in the colors of the gown and hat , closely approximating the actual shades , and then touched up the face to suit her fancy . After three minutes of intense pleasure , the lady was completed , torn from the drawing pad , and another picture was begun . " Why , she 's a wonder ! " exclaimed my friend , who had been quietly looking on . I refuted her statement warmly ; the child was merely a normal child whose every interest had been kept alive and given free expression . " But how do you make her do that ? " " I do not make her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then how , " persisted my friend , " did you get her to want to ? " What I told her was in brief as follows . The child 's drawing was but a natural development of her previous training . Her earlier training in buttoning her own clothes and handling a knife , fork , and spoon had given her a bodily control , particularly a // control of the hand and fingers , which had made the handling of a pencil easy and natural for her . There never had been any cramped , painful , clumsy effort such as we see , for instance , in the attempts to write of children whose parents have considered education as a matter to be deferred until 8 : 45 A.M. on a certain Monday morning in September after the sixth birthday . Also , she had early been made familiar with color ? the colors of the objects which were intimately associated with her hourly life , the clothes she wore , the food she ate . Also , among her earliest playthings were paper and crayons , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The child 's drawing , therefore , was but a natural development of her previous training . Now the principle behind my teaching of drawing was to recognize and engage the child 's spirit of play ; to make drawing an expression of the child 's play spirit ? to make it real play to her . " Now let us play a surprise ' game , " I would say to her . " Close your eyes until I say Ready " ? // which Mary would always do . While her eyes were closed I would lay on her table before her a potato . " Now I 'll close my eyes , and you make me a big , big surprise and draw me a picture of this potato . When it is done say Ready . ' I would then turn my back , or put my hands across my eyes , there would be a moment of scratching , and then an excited cry of " Ready ! " At sight of the irregular circle filled in with brown crayon that represented her conception of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would burst into little cries of pleasure ? and then she would be eager to draw something else . Thus she made pictures of oranges , apples , pears , and afterwards colored them with crayons . And as she developed , she went on to more difficult familiar objects , chairs , tables , people . Today , drawing is as natural a means of recreation with her as roller-skating or skipping a rope . She demands that she shall have a piece of French chalk whenever she goes out ; and when there comes a lull in the play of her and her friends , she is most likely // to go scurrying off to where there is a quiet stretch of walk , produce her chalk and proceed to cover the smooth cement with boys and girls and houses and trains . There has been nothing like a formal drawing lesson ; I would not know how to give one ; and I am not at all concerned whether or not the child becomes an artist . The important thing , in my mind , is that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression ; that play , and most enjoyable play , too , is educating her to an ever more accurate control of her muscles ( what would even a Rodin be without his marvellous dexterity of hand ! ) , is developing her senses of form and color , is making instinctive with her the habit of close observation , and is developing her powers of memory and imagination . I have dealt first with drawing for the reason that in children , as in the early races of man , the picture as a medium for expressing ideas represents an earlier stage of development than formal writing ; and also for the reason that exactly the same principle // that lies behind drawing as lies behind writing and reading ? the principle of enlisting the child 's play instinct . While touching on this subject of " formal education " I wish to say that any normal child , if properly trained , can be taught to read and write and draw at the age of four ? and to say further that reading and writing and drawing can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say , that though I regard this beginning of reading and writing at an early age as highly desirable , since it can be begun then just as well as two or three years later , and since it can be made a form of play to the child , I do not regard it as the great fundamental in child-training . The fundamental is to give your child self-control , control of his body , of his mind , of his emotions , and to keep its mind alert and eager , and to develop all its other qualities to their fullest and freest ; if your child have such development , formal education may be begun at any age , and whenever begun it will be easy . I hope that I have made clear that an // essential part of this new vision of play is a genuine respect for the child 's play . The parent must get the child 's point of view in regard to play . The parent must realize that the child 's play , especially when the result of that play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evolved out of its own being , with its own hands ? is as important in the child 's life as is the work of the parent , and should be treated with the same consideration and seriousness as the creation of an adult . I have marvelled again and again at the utter thoughtlessness and disrespect , even among cultivated people , that is shown for children 's play . There are mothers who think nothing of disturbing a child at play ; of upsetting , perhaps not meaning to do so , things that children built or made , without even apologizing or expressing regret . Yet these very mothers expect children to be respectful , considerate , and thoughtful of them and of their work . // GROUP PLAY AND HOW TO ORGANIZE IT WHAT I have said in the preceding chapter refers especially to the play of the individual child in its own home , under the direction of its parent , or to its play when more or less alone . What I shall say in the following pages will refer especially to the play of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will refer to the value of this kind of play to the child 's development ? though much of what I have written about home play can be adapted to play in groups , and much of what is said about group play can be adapted to the home . Before going into detail concerning methods of organized group play , I wish to call attention to two of its fundamental advantages which play in no other form supplies : First , the particular opportunities that group // playing offers the child ; second , the great advantage it offers to the parent in being legitimately relieved for a period daily from the personal care of the child , knowing at the same time that the child is profiting in every way from this separation . First , as to the advantage group playing offers to the child which he can not get either by playing alone or with his parent . As I have said elsewhere , however trivial a child 's play may seem to us , it is profoundly important to him . It is not only his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recreation and pleasure ; but it is also his best opportunity for experimentation and adventure , and it can also be made the means of his mental and spiritual growth . Play is his great serious work ? in a word , play is his life . Just as we adults learn most by doing things and from doing them , just so do children learn and develop best through their own various personal experiences . The child , therefore , who learns to play in harmony , in sympathy , with his equals ? that is , with children of approximately his own strength , mentally , spiritually , // and physically  --  is learning one of the most important lessons in human relationships . He is learning the fundamental principles of modern society ? how to live with his fellowmen . The child who learns to play fairly , to be unselfish in his play , to accept a defeat in good spirit ? the child who learns early to realize that he is only one of many and therefore entitled only to a share of all pleasures and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is scrupulously honest and accurate in his play , not because he is watched but because he is awakened to a keen sense of honor ? such a child , once having acquired these habits in his play , will most likely , when he becomes an adult , apply the same standards in all his relationships in life . Self-control , equal opportunity , the spirit of fair play , these ideas which arc the heart of group play , should also rule in one 's intimate life at home , in one 's business , in politics ? in fact , in all of life 's " games . " I do not in the slightest degree wish to minimize the immeasurable importance in // the child 's development of a beautiful home relationship ; but it must be recognized that however careful a parent is in directing her child 's play , however ethical and spiritual her personal relation with the child , what the parent can do is necessarily limited . The family circle is usually too small , especially where there is but one child , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an adequate opportunity in the home for practical democratic social intercourse . Now as to the second fundamental point , the advantage group playing holds for the parent . The average mother who gives her entire life to her children , who is with them constantly , who does everything for them , and who prides herself in this devotion , is too frequently a mother who can not in the end honestly boast either of the great success she has made of her children or the great success she has made of herself . In the majority of such cases of mother devotion , the children are likely to be found selfish , or dependent , or lacking in spirit ; and the mother , when she should be in her prime , is likely to be // physically and nervously worn , and to be mentally stagnant ; and , further sad consequence of this continuous intimacy and contact , it is common to find an utter lack of sympathy between the parent and child , and frequently harmony and even love are absent . This is indeed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is a condition , however reluctant we are to admit it , that is true , and , what is more , there is every good reason for its being true . No work in the world makes greater demands on a human being than conscientious , thoughtful care of the little child . Few human beings are so marvellously constituted as to be able to give themselves completely over a period of years for from twelve to fourteen hours daily ( a child under five usually requires attention of some kind the greater part of these hours , and if the care is not active none the less the responsibility is always present ) and yet come out of such an experience nervously , spiritually , physically , and mentally unimpaired . Unless the mother knows how to organize her great task , the // wear and tear on both mother and child of such an unbroken relationship is beyond endurance , and those of us who have observed such mothers and children know the penalty paid by both in irritation , in nervousness , and even actual illness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best development and happiness of both mother and child than a daily period of separation from each other ? a period in which the child can get away , with safety to himself , from the watchful intimacy of his mother , in which he can relax and learn to live independently of her ? and a period during which the mother will be relieved of all responsibility of him and be given a chance to recuperate ; a period in which she can forget her immediate personal cares , and interest herself in things outside of her household , from which brief vacations she can return refreshed , enriched in experience , broadened in sympathy , and therefore more fit for the performance of her duties as an intelligent and truly devoted mother . These dangers , difficulties , needs , can be zoo GROUP PLAY ? HOW TO ORGANIZE IT met to a great degree by organized group play . I do not mean to convey the impression that children now do not play in groups ? they do indeed , but such group playing that exists is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief benefit to those who can dominate the group . The group is usually ruled by sheer physical strength ; here might is right . The most that any young child secures from it is an outlet for his physical energy , and that very often is at the expense of other children . In such group playing the tendency is for the strong to get stronger and the weak to get weaker ; and if through this playing physical skill is developed , it is very frequently acquired at the expense of the child 's character development . Such playing is certainly better than no playing ; but its undisciplined , irresponsible , chaotic character is blamable for many pernicious habits among children ; such playing , in many instances , can not but make normal desires become perverted , and make normal energies and emotions twisted , destructive forces . zoi HOW TO KNOW YOUR CHILD Group play , to be most valuable for the very young , must be organized . Organized play should and in time will be taken over by our educational system ? and mothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let growing children wait for this better day ; in the meanwhile , it is within the power of mothers to supply this need , if only they will go about it with thought and determination . What I shall here say about group playing and how to organize a play group applies equally to the mothers of wealth and the mothers of modest income ; to the mother who has no aid in attending her three or four , and to the mother who has a sort of nurse-policeman to escort each of her children to the park . The chief difference arises from the application of the ideas . This difference , in turn , arises from the difference in income ; mothers of modest means may have as fine a spirit as the mothers who can afford a more elaborate equipment ? and spirit is the main thing . There are three preliminary practical problems connected with the formation of such a group . First of these is how the organization // of mothers is to be brought about . I am going to leave this to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in different communities that no suggestions can be made that will fit all . Besides , mothers have had the training in women 's clubs , church societies , etc. , to equip them for launching such an organization . The important points are that there shall be the inauguration and maintenance of a play group , and that this organization shall consist of enough mothers ( say of twenty to thirty children ) to supply sufficient funds for their cooperative plan . The second of these practical problems is the securing of a proper space for the purpose , a large , light , airy room for very cold and wet days , with perhaps a vacant lot or a back yard or a safe roof or a corner in a near-by public park for nice days and summer use . Here also I must leave it to the good sense of the mothers to do their best under local conditions . The third problem , and most important of all , is to secure a competent person to direct // the play-group . I wish to emphasize here that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but a person who can apply her training to bring out the best in the children and who will not try to make the children fit her training . She must have physical vigor , must come to her work fresh and with enthusiasm ; she must have a spirit free and elastic enough to enter into the children 's spirit , she must have a broad vision and , above all , must have a sympathetic understanding and a real appreciation of the needs of childhood and a realization of the value play holds for the child 's best development . Here again the matter must be left to the good sense of the mothers , for the work of the person chosen to direct it . Further , the play group , to give to the child what it should have , must be organized under following principles : First , the group should meet within a short distance of the child 's home , so that the child can easily get to it every day for a period of from three to four hours . Second , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true democratic social spirit , whereby every one will share equally in all its advantages . Third , it must be organized on the basis of self-dependence and self-government . Therefore , it must be organized with the view to give to the child a legitimate , pleasure-giving , constructive outlet for all his energies , physical , intellectual , emotional . This play group , without losing any of its pleasure-giving qualities , should help to develop the child 's physical strength , his skill , his imagination ; it should help him to gain harmonious control of his mind and body , and it should help him to acquire the habit of concentration . I now come to what is for me the most important part of this subject ? what can be done for and with the child in such a group . I will state that for several consecutive years , in connection with my work , I had under my daily direction play groups ranging in size from thirty children to over one thousand ? though in the case of this , latter figure I subdivided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can best say what I have to say , and at the same time be more definitely suggestive and helpful , by giving here my personal experience with several of the play groups I have conducted . The group I shall speak of first was made up of children who came from the most crowded tenement section of the city of New York , from homes where life meant a continuous struggle for existence and where the training of the child was only of last , and often of least importance . This particular group was subsidized ; I am assuming , of course , that mothers who will be interested in starting such a play group will themselves finance the affair . The group met indoors in a large , bright , airy room . I have always made it a special point to have a bright and attractive room for this purpose ; harmonious , orderly , peaceful surroundings are an essential factor in the child 's training , and especially is a cheerful , peaceful atmosphere necessary for indoor playing on dismal days . It is impossible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , can be saved 2o6 GROUP PLAY ? HOW TO ORGANIZE IT by appreciating the effect of material and human " atmosphere " upon the child . The room was theoretically divided into two sections : one half of it , furnished with low tables and chairs , was reserved for quiet games and occupations ; and the other section was used for games requiring skilful activity , such as quoits , ring toss , faba gaba , and skoopit . On one side of the room , games , toys , and books were arranged on shelves within easy reach of the youngest and shortest child in the room . With the exception of certain games , which were distinctly for the older children , the games were not piled on top of each other but each game had a place of its own , so that the youngest child could , without too much exertion , replace the game he used in its own place as he had found it . I wish to call attention to this seemingly unimportant point because just such a simple arrangement can stimulate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to do things for himself and to take pleasure and interest in doing them . The average attendance of this indoor play // group was thirty children , the ages ranging from three to twelve . To impress every child with the reality of his being a part of the organization , each child was given a membership card ? a neat little oblong of red cardboard , on it the name we had given the play group and also the child 's name . This card entitled its possessor to all the pleasures and privileges that room had to offer , provided the child agreed that he would also share in its responsibilities . Naturally , the responsibility of each child depended on his age and his intelligence . The principal idea the children had to realize about the play group was that every child 's pleasure and happiness in that play group depended upon himself . At first , some of the children found it quite difficult to understand this fundamental idea , and some did not really grasp it until after some rather unpleasant experiences , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the children adjusted themselves in a comparatively brief time to the simple conditions that were imposed . There were no absolute , inviolable laws // that governed this play group , but in spirit the play group was guided more or less by the following simple rules of conduct : First . Every child was entitled to full freedom so long as his freedom did not interfere with the freedom and pleasure of others . For instance , every child was free to choose his own game , provided , of course , it was suited to his age and ability ; here , as director , I used my experience and best judgment . to help any child who was in need of assistance to choose the right game . He was allowed to play with it a complete round ? and longer , if he desired , but with the understanding that as soon as there was a call for it by any other member he was immediately to give it up . Second . If a child wanted a particular game which was in use by someone else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that child tried to take it away by force from the other child , he automatically forfeited his right to play that game that day . Third . Every member of the play group was obliged to put the game he used in order and replace it where it belonged . // Fourth . No one had a right to take another game before replacing the one he had used first . Fifth . Every child was responsible for the cleanliness and order of the room . For instance , if a child cut and pasted pictures , he had to clear away the mess he had made before he could do anything else . If he balked at performing his share of the work ? if , for example , the child refused to replace in their box the building blocks he was using and return the same to their place ? the blocks were allowed to remain in precisely the condition in which he left them , the child was asked to sit quietly at a small table by himself where he was practically ignored and deprived of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own conduct , soon wearied the little child , and in most cases it was sufficient to bring the child to understand his mistake , and of his own accord he would slip over to the chaotic heap and eagerly put blocks in order and return them to where they belonged . In connection with this method of enforcing our rules , I want to make clear that the 2I0 GROUP PLAY ? HOW TO ORGANIZE IT punishment or disgrace , or the bitter lesson which the child had thus to learn for his own good , was never brought up as a basis for further unpleasantness to the child , was never " rubbed " into him , which is such a common sin among parents . Once the child realized his mistake and made an effort to do better , he was accepted on that new basis . This attitude helped to deepen the sympathetic comradeship between the child and the director . And because of this attitude , the child could not help but appreciate , first , that it was much pleasanter and simpler to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the director was his friend , whose primary wish was to help him and not to punish him . All these simple rules of " fair play , " of " living and letting live , " were impressed upon the children consistently , with courtesy , with kindness , with firmness , but never in a spirit of fault-finding ? rather in a spirit of stimulating the best response from the child and taking it for granted that he was willing and anxious to do and give his best . At this point , at the danger of repeating 2II HOW TO KNOW YOUR CHILD myself , I wish to make more clear , to emphasize , my position in regard to organized play . I have no thought of relentless , changeless discipline ; such ideas are farthest from my heart and mind . In my belief , through properly organized play we can get the nearest approach to free play . During my personal experience as director of play groups , I was never an autocrat ; I tried to keep myself as much in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in cases of emergency , where a matter of justice had to be decided , or a new game had to be explained or taught , or perhaps new spirit had to be injected into the play . Otherwise , I tried merely to be is member of the group ? just an older friend , an older playmate . In the foregoing pages , I have tried briefly to outline the organization of the play room and in a general way to suggest something of its influence on the child . Some of the games used , each of which was selected with definite thought to its educational as well as pleasure-giving value , I shall discuss in my next chapter , entitled " Play Materials . " // Here is the daily program carried out in the play room . The hours were from 3 : 00 to 5 : 30 P.M. on school days , and from 9 : 30 to 12:00 A.M. and from 3 : oo to 5 : 30 P.M. on Saturdays . ( Mothers organizing a play group and having children below school age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ session . ) It was understood that older children who had home duties and other demands on their time had the privilege of attending the play group on such days as they were free to do so . Nine-tenths of the children , however , attended the play group regularly . The program was roughly divided into three periods . First , there was a free period with quiet games at tables or table occupations . The purpose of this period was , chiefly , to allow the children to relax and to adjust themselves to the standard of conduct in the play room . It was necessary for the children to learn to appreciate the important fact that indoor playing could not be as violent and as noisy as playing outdoors , that it must naturally be restricted ; and it was the aim of this period to get the children , so to speak , // in the right tune . This precaution helped to modulate the children 's voices and helped prevent the formation of the disagreeable habit children are likely to get into of talking too loudly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature to calm the children . During this period I had my best opportunity to study the nature and special characteristics of every child , to learn the children 's strengths , and to find out where they were weak and needed help . For instance , when I observed a child who could not handle the simplest game without dropping its parts a number of times , who handled his game clumsily , I realized that that child was lacking in muscular control and I saw to it that he played games which helped him in his needed development . If a child found it very difficult or almost impossible to thread a tapestry needle with wool , or could not make the simplest braid of raffia , I realized that that child was lacking in coordination and muscular control and I saw to it that he got the special play required by his deficiency . Such simple games as jack straws gave me 2I4 GROUP PLAY ? HOW TO ORGANIZE IT the key to a child 's sense of honor ; in this game you miss when one straw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honorable they easily could take advantage of each other . Also in these quiet , free games I was able to detect the children who were lacking in concentration , one of the commonest faults in children due to neglected training , a fault which can be easily remedied through games . For instance , the child who would keep continually changing one game for another without playing it or even trying to find out how it was played , was helped to find a game particularly fitting to his needs , so that the playing of it would really be of interest to him and stimulate him to play with it for a considerable period . Thus I learned to know every child and learned how I best could serve him . Second , came a period of free , active games , the purpose here being to give the children an outlet for their physical energy . Between the first and second period there was an intermission of a few minutes in which the children put away the quiet games they had been // using ; the older children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room , and the younger children placed the chairs on another side of the room , this to clear the floor for the active play . The play during this period was usually in ring formations , with and without singing , and consisted of rhythmic work , and various hopping and skipping and dancing games ; also we had impromptu dramatic performances of stories we had read . All children , young and old , were admitted into these games , provided they involved no contests of physical strength . The purpose of admitting all was chiefly to put into practice ideas of democracy ; the older children were given an opportunity , and were required , to be thoughtful of the younger ones , and were stimulated to find pleasure in giving pleasure to others , even though it meant sometimes sacrificing their own desires . This mixture of ages incidentally helped to keep these games from becoming too boisterous ; in other words , it naturally kept the noise within the limits of what can be endured in indoor playing . // The third , and last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desirable in all playing , whether at home or in a group away from home , that the latter part of the afternoon should not be spent in over-stimulating activity . The greatest effort should be made to have only such activity as will help quiet the children 's nerves and relax their bodies , so that the children will not be too excited to eat and digest properly their evening meal and not too over-stimulated to fall into a restful sleep . For these reasons , this period was always given to story telling by myself or some other adult , occasionally illustrated with stereopticon views ; or sometimes a story was told or retold by one of the children themselves . During these occasions the matter of good manners could incidentally be emphasized . Each child was required to sit quietly and listen quietly , whether he was interested in the story or not . Of course this demand was kept within reason , due consideration being given to the ages of the children . Whenever possible , the children were divided into two groups , the younger // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . During this period the children 's imagination was allowed to play freely ; one opportunity of expressing itself the children had in illustrating the stories they heard . Pads and pencils were supplied them for that purpose . A particular effort was made to end the afternoon in a harmonious spirit . After the story there usually was some quiet music , during which time the children in silence replaced everything that was out of place , took their wraps and hats and prepared for their departure . When all was in order and the children were ready , the music was changed into marching time and the children marched around the room once or twice , when I took my place at the door where I shook the hand of every child and wished him " Good-by " as he quietly walked out . The outdoor play group in its general organization ? that is , as to the parents ' part in it , as to its membership , as to the children 's share in its responsibilities ? is the same as the indoor play group . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same democratic , social spirit that governs and is behind play indoors should govern play out of doors . But because of the outdoor environment and the conditions that go with it , the program of activity is of necessity somewhat different . First , I shall treat of how we met the distinct problems which outdoor playing created . A vacant lot , or a yard , can be made ideal for this kind of play ; but we had no such blessing and had to play in a park . There are unavoidable disturbances and distractions which playing in a public place bring . This problem was more or less met by choosing an out-of-the-way corner in the park where there were no benches and where people were likely to pass less frequently than in other parts . After the first few days the curiosity of passersby waned and the group was left in peace . Every child was provided with a light , inexpensive camp stool which he brought to the park daily for use during such games and occupations as necessitated sitting down . Another problem which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // ing and caring for materials ; also the lack of tables for using certain materials , a/nd gusts of winds , created other problems . Because of these drawbacks , the occupation periods were planned to depend on very simple materials , such as could be used without any , or with very little , tools ; raffia , shoe-strings , light cardboard , sketch books , pencils and crayons were the materials we chiefly used . Every child carried his own material in a light cardboard portmanteau hung on a light tape across his shoulder ? which bag , by the way , every child made for himself . The outdoor play group was divided into two or more sections , depending on the number of children present . Because of the more vigorous activities that playing in the open permitted , it was impractical and even dangerous to have groups of too varied ages play together . The program was divided roughly into three parts , and the nature of each part depended to a great extent upon the season of the year . The first period was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had all 220 // opportunity for physical exercise . The precation , starting the children in a low key , that was necessary to observe in playing inside four walls was naturally not required in outdoor playing . On cold , fresh , crisp days the physical games were of course more vigorous than on humid and warm days . These games consisted usually of various ball games , bean bag games , jumping the rope , hop-scotch , running contests , puss-in-the-corner , fox and geese . The greatest effort was made to get out of these games the full physical , social and ethical value they held for the children . For instance , particular attention was always paid to observing the rules of the games ; everyone 's right was respected ; and everyone shared equally in the games ' pleasures , advantages and responsibilities . The play in the second and third periods likewise varied according to the weather ; and varied also according to the condition of the children after the first period . That is , if during the first period the children seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KNOW YOUR CHILD second period was planned to require less physical exertion . Perhaps it would be a period for occupation ? for instance , braiding , weaving and sewing with raffia , which required concentration , more intelligent use of the children 's power of observation , and more accurate use of the smaller muscles . If , on the other hand , the first period was not very strenuous the second period was devoted to social games , usually play in ring formations , and while there was a good deal of activity in these games the physical activity was much more restricted and the children had greater opportunity for self-expression and the use of the imagination . The third period , the last , was always more or less a period of quiet , and the afternoon usually ended with a story . Part of the program in connection with the play groups consisted in occasionally visiting places of interest , such as aquariums , museums , public libraries , zoological and botanical gardens . During these visits a particular effort was made not to over-burden or irritate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should observe . On the contrary , the children were left free to get as much out of these visits for themselves as possible ; but when they asked questions or showed a particular interest in something , serious care was given to answering the questions intelligently and simply . These visits served the children in many ways : tested and developed their memory ; aroused their curiosity ; enriched their imagination ; gave them a legitimate opportunity for constructive exercise of their emotions , which , for lack of proper use , are so often wasted in irritation and temper . Much of what I have here said regarding details of organized play must be considered as merely suggestive , to be adapted by groups of mothers to their varying conditions . Rut the fundamentals are the same , whether the location be a small town with plenty of space or a crowded city , whether the parents be wealthy or of very limited means . The value to children and mothers of such organized play groups is beyond dispute ; but I wish to say , in closing this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree of success that will attend such a cooperative attempt will depend upon the harmony , knowledge and efficiency of the mothers ' organization , upon the fitness for the purpose of the site chosen for play , and , most of all , upon the tact , spirit , and good judgment of the person selected as director . // MATERIALS FOR PLAY As I have already sought to emphasize , the important thing about play is the new attitude toward it ; is the recognition of the invaluable opportunities play offers for the training and development of the child . Of only secondary importance is the material with which the child plays . We are going to have better play materials just as soon as parents recognize the need of such , and when the pleasure and development of the child becomes the first consideration in the manufacture of toys , instead of mere profit as at present is the case . But even now there is much excellent material easily within the reach of the modest income , or already exist ing in the average home . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those that a child can " do things with . " // The chief thing is to use these commonplace materials with intelligence , to discover and apply their developing qualities to the budding faculties of the child . Before going further into this subject , I wish to admit very frankly that much of the material which I shall mention will appear to many of my readers as the commonplaces of child life . The spirit in which they may be used is alone new . But in behalf of these commonplace and inexpensive materials I wish to say that , if they are used in the right spirit , they are better than the costly equipments which have been made a part of some educator 's system , such as Madame Montessori 's . In fact , I hold that the very limited and specialized use that can be made of much of the Montessori material , which is supposed to be its particular virtue , is often more of a drawback to the child than a benefit . Even so simple and common a material as building blocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a farm today , " three little friends of mine were told ; " let 's see // how much we can remember . " On their return they occupied themselves for days with a game of their own planning , that of farmer . They assumed the parts of father farmer , mother farmer and child farmer , and first built for themselves a farm-house of the plain wooden blocks . The floor , instead of being carpeted , had a neat pattern of blue and white stars made from parquetry ? a variety of blocks painted or stained a solid color in two or three sides , and each of the other sides painted in two colors , the surface divided parallelly to form quadrangles or diagonally to form triangles . Behind the house a garden was laid off . This was enclosed by a barb-wire fence , with blocks as posts across whose tops ran a thin picture wire held in place by carpet tacks hammered in by the children . Beyond the garden was a stable , with stalls for the horses and the cows . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After this structural work was done , the children proceeded to imitate various farming processes they had observed . // This simple material had for these children a constant interest because it had become to them a means of self-expression . It developed their observation , imagination , manual dexterity ? and , in this particular instance , fixed in their minds in a most pleasurable way some of the prominent details of farming . Plasticene , or modelling clay , is one of the most responsive materials to the child 's steadily growing imagination and observation ; it holds constant surprises for him , and its possibilities increase with a child 's development . A child of two can , with his own tiny palms , in less than a minute , make a real ball ; by putting his thumb in that ball and pressing it slightly against a table , he has a bowl very much like his porridge bowl ; by turning the bowl upside down and flattening its edges a bit , he has a hat . And so he can go on , daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children of three model cups , saucers , spoons , forks , knives baskets , bird'snests with eggs , various pieces of furniture , and even members of their immediate family . zz8 MATERIALS FOR PLAY In working with plastic materials , or any constructive materials , the child should be given the fullest possible freedom ; only by allowing freedom can one ascertain to what extent the child uses his own eyes , his own judgment , and expresses himself . No matter how crude or shapeless , from the adult 's point of view , the child 's interpretation of an object may be , the adult should recognize the child 's effort with all seriousness . A correction should never be made by merely improving upon the child 's work . An effort should be made to have the child discover his own mistake . If , for instance , he makes a table with three legs , which should have four , ask the child to look at a table and count the legs . If the child makes a hand with four fingers , ask him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mistake , makes his own correction , and his power of observation is thereby sharpened . One of the most pleasure-giving , useful and satisfactory occupations I know for small fingers is for the child to make his own plastic material . Besides having the interest to the child of making the entire thing himself , this // home-made material is inexpensive , gives the child opportunity to use his imagination , to choose his own color , and calls into action many of the child 's faculties which the prepared clay does not offer . The following is the recipe for this home-made plastic material : Take two tablespoonfuls cornstarch , four tablespoonfuls salt , four tablespoonfuls boiling water ; for larger quantity use materials in same proportion ; color with blueing , red ink or color from the child 's water-color box . Mix cornstarch and salt in a small cooking pot . Pour on the colored boiling water and stir quickly until mixture is soft . Place on fire and stir until mixture forms a soft ball . Take off and knead with the hands for ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot water ; if it sticks to hands , dust the hands with cornstarch . This clay may be used for modelling all kinds of articles . These articles will keep their shape permanently , unless broken , for the material dries and becomes very hard . An especially attractive use of this material is to make it into beads . This is done by rolling balls and piercing 230
