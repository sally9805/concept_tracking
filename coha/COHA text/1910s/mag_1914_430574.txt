One imagines it was her individualism that led Miss Ellen Key to write " The Younger Generation , " ? a book on socialism . The individual is never indifferent to her : she is far too passionate , too intense , to value anything so abstract and unreal as a mass . In other words , she is a woman and a poet first , and after that a social theorist . In her bias in favor of the individual , she only reflects that fierce individualism of the North which struck and even daunted the imagination of Europe in the grim and lonely figure of Ibsen , and outraged so many sensibilities in the remorseless egotism of Strindberg . Politically Ibsen and Miss Ellen Key are poles apart ; spiritually ? which is all that matters ? they are really near together . She is a socialist for the same reason that he was an anarchist : because of an intense desire to bring about a greater freedom in the development of personality . Miss Key is a radical , of course ; but she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efficacy of easy nostrums ; she is refreshingly free from those very illusions we have no right to expect feminist leaders to have rid themselves of , as yet . She can , for example , be as heartily contemptuous of the vote as an American cynic sipping his whiskey and water in a club window ; she can speak of  | parliaments as slightingly as Mr. Wells himself . But it is significant that she rarely chooses to do so . These things ? political rights ? will come to women . Well , then , it is necessary to be prepared for something else ; it is necessary to keep one 's eye fixed on the end rather than the means ; and the end is an indefinite enhancement of life through the enrichment of the individual . Without knowing precisely what Miss Key 's spiritual history has been , one hazards the guess that she became a socialist only after a prolonged and anxious weighing of the issues . Like so many other socialists of our time , she has not been without a fear of ultimate democracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) before the vision of a world transformed into a huge Chautauqua assembly , peaceful , stuffed with plenty , shockingly inert . For the values she prizes are never cheap values ; they are the reverse ; they are even ( as in the case of marriage ) a little too mystical and remote for the average man . They are often vague , but they are always ideal values and they are always characteristically feminine values . So it is natural that what she demands of socialism is that it shall produce not contented men , but better men . She has no wish to eliminate struggle ; she wishes rather to persuade herself that socialism will not eliminate struggle , and she does persuade herself at least . A civilization that can not produce superior men is valueless . She is not indifferent to the average man . She believes that the two rise together , and that the average man is helpless without natural leaders . If he can not breed them , he will not even hold his own ; he will slip back . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be born in Tierra del Fuego ; there is , of course , action and reaction . If she turns to socialism , it is largely because she believes socialism will afford a better environment for the man of genius . Many vigorous opponents of socialism now concede that it is possible to improve the material condition of men in the gross . But , they say , you will do so only by depressing the whole human group , by perilously curtailing the opportunities of the fortunate few and by the fierce and stupid suppression of individual initiative . Miss Key does not blink this danger of the domination of the herd . She knows that democracies have not always been ideal breeding places of exceptional men . ( She points to Switzerland and the United States . ) There is a peril , but to offset that possible waste she points to the vast , the unguessed release of energy that might result if the whole mass of mankind were miraculously to enjoy a place in the sun . Who can say how human progress might be accelerated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generation could be connected somehow with the driving wheel of civilization ? Is it not conceivable that we should get on faster ? Peasant stock has given us many men of genius , but only the strongest have been able to climb up , to survive the ordeal ? and genius is not always strong physically . In the face of this alluring possibility , she persuades herself easily , far too easily , that the proletariat will succeed where the middle class has failed ? that it will be permanently idealistic . But , in the first place , this is a thing that has never happened to any class in society , and , in the second , we have absolutely no reason to believe that the proletariat is composed of better stuff than the middle class . It is even idle to contend that the great movement for social reform among the workers is in the main a disinterested movement . To admit that it is not , is not to criticize or belittle socialism . A disinterested movement could never accomplish so vast a task as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to confer any advantage on society , it will have to be a skeptical and wary socialism , ? a socialism that has learned to distrust the organization that now makes it strong . And this is the gist of Miss Key 's message in " The Younger Generation . " It is a warning to socialists , though not to socialists alone . We live in an age of association , following upon an age in which individualism had reached the homicidal stage , and we have carried organization too far . " The atmosphere created by association makes those who live in it devoid of responsibility and remorse , ' to borrow one of Kierkegaard 's profound sayings of the dangers of shared activity . " Miss Key is far from being alone in urging us to be on our guard against the so-called " social conscience . " All that is deep and valuable in the human spirit is matured in silence and in lonely meditation . We can not save our souls in a group . " What is public opinion ? " asked Nietzsche . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A socialist state which put down private opinion would be a social disaster , no matter how comfortable its members might be . So would a socialist state that interfered with the free development of its citizens . The servile state has no part in her dreams of the future . And socialists above all must rise to an understanding of the precise virtue there is in association , ? cooperation in the business of getting food and other material things ; but  | in the life of the spirit an intense and even fierce independence , ? an individualism as vigorous and uncompromising as that of Nietzsche himself . It is characteristic of Miss Key 's idealism that she accepts this communistic ideal without a rigid examination of the underlying economic argument . How is socialism to be brought about ? What is to be the machinery ? She does not concern herself with all that . She says simply : " I do not understand it . " Her acceptance of its ideal is the result of her woman 's revolt ? a sentimental revolt , if you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Human society can not remain indifferent ; it must find a way out . Being impatient of arguments , she does not herself argue . Indeed , she distrusts intellectualism altogether ; she relies largely on intuition . She would infect you with her enthusiasm rather than convince your mind . She speaks always as a seer rather than as a thinker , and doubtless she is wise to do so . By way of postscript , one would add that there is included in this volume an essay on universal peace . In a recent London dispatch Mr. Francis Grierson was reported to have remarked that the great European war will doubtless overwhelm many Utopian philoso phies . One can only say for Miss Ellen Key that she is not a peace advocate of the " im possibilist " school . Having said so much , however , one really feels justified in saying no more for the present . It is undeniably a sad time for idealism of whatever sort .  |                  @ @ @
