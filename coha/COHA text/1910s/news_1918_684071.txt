txt A survey just completed id the woods south of MOzy , through which the Germans advanced against the Americans on Monday morning , and subsequently were driven back across the Marne , revealed that more than 6,000 Hun fighters had been killed there . The officers who made the survey tell me that the bodies at some spots were three and four deep where in close formation the Germans tried to go ahead against our machine guns . According to the usual ratio between the killed and total casualties , this would mean that we inflicted more than 20,000 casualties on the boche . Practically the whole of the Kaiser 's famed 10th Guard Division came across the Marne against the , Americans , and very few of them I got hack . Prisoners taken from the 16th Grenadiers said one battalion was annihilated in the woods , and of the other battalion about one company was left . Since our troops threw the Germans back across the Marne on the sector from Gland to 1Jaulgonne , the enemy has made no ilfurther attempt to cross there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that one reason- why the , Germans suffered such heavy losses in the woods forming the triangle I from Fossoy , to Mezy , to Crezancy , was , that the Americans were overI whelmed by such large numbers that  --  the line could not hold , but nevertheless refused to retreat where it could possibly hold a place in the woods . This sent the German advance sweeping over large numbers of nests which sheltered ten , five , or two Americans , and sometimes one , who stuck while the boches passed by and then opened up on them . How 13 Men Captured 159 . Last night tales of heroism of these men were being told . I believe that of all of them the story of Sergeant J. F. Brown was most notable . Brown commanded a detachment of eleven men whin the German onslaught came . They had shelter , which saved them under the heavy German bombardment , and when the advancing boche came along they let him pass , and then got ready to turn their machine gun loose . But just then a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his men to scatter quickly . Ile ducked into the . woods , and saw the Huns put his beloved machine gun out of the war . The Germans passed on . Brown looked around and seemed to be alone . He started toward the Marne , away from his own lines , and met his Captain , also alone . These , two Americans , out there in the woods in the dark , the Captain with an automatic pistol and Brown with an automatic rifle , saw that the boche barrage kept ' them from getting to their own lines , and so decided to kill all the Germans they could before they themselves were killed . They lay in the thicket while the Germans passed by in large numbers . According to Brown 's report , they heard two machine rs going back of them , and decidedlo go and get them . The two crept close and charged one ' of the machine guns , which killed . the American Captain . Brown got the tone German gunner with his rifle . Then up came an American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brown and the Corporal started after the ' second German machine gun , behind a clump of bushes . They got closes and Brown with his automatic rifle killed three Germans , the crew of the gun . Then , attracted by the shooting close at hand , up came the eleven men Brown had commanded , each looking for Germans . Brown resumed command , and led the party to where they could see more Germans in a sector of trench taken from the Americans . The Big Bag . These thirteen Americans performed a feat never to be forgotten : The Germans evidently were left in the trenches with machine guns to meet a counterattack should the Americans make one . Brown posted his twelve men about the Hun position in twelve directions . He took a position where he could rake the trench with his automatic rifle .. At a signal the twelve Americans opened up with their rifles from twelve points , and Brown started working his automatic rifle . Brown said he did n't know how many Germans he killed , but fired his rifle until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had to rest it across a stump . The Germans , then thinking they Were attacked by a large party , decided to surrender . A German Major stepped out of the trench with his hands high , yelling " Kamerad " Brown laid down his heated rifle , and while three of the hidden Americans guarded him , advanced toward the Major . Then all thirteen Amerleans moved in and ' dithrrned the Germans . Brown said he did n't know how many there were , but it was more than 100 . Then , with Brown and the Corporal at the head , and the other eleven Americans in the rear , the procession started through the woods , guided by a doughboy 's compass , toward the American lines . It was n't plain sailing . They were behind the German advance , and had to pass it and a space between the fighting Germans and the Americans . On the way through the woods several parties , of Germans saw the advar : : - ing column , with Brown and the Corporal at its head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brown led his party , to a place where the German advance line was broken . Just as he started over the American lines the Germans laid down a barrage . This got four of the Germans , but did n't touch an American . Brown and his twelve comrades got back with 155 prisoners . The four killed made a total ' for the thirteen Americans of 159 . Took Important Maps Also . American officers were almost dumfounded at the strange tale Brown brought back , but doubt vanished when , soon after he reached regimental headquarters , a military policeman showed lap with a large bundle of maps and pla : . s Brown had taken from dead German officers killed by his automatic rifle , and , handing them to Brown , said : " Gim me my receipt . " Brown , who is 23 years old and last year was a shipping clerk , had met this man on the way back , and , turning over the maps , which made a heavy bundle , had stopped while he scribbled out the receipt he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This receipt is part of the records of the American Army . The prisoners included a Major , one Captain , two Lieutenants , and a number of noncommissioned officers . It is this individual fighting . of Americans lost in the woods that dumfounded the Germans . Many prisoners actually complained of it as unfair warfare . Generally the rule for soldiers cut off from their command and isolated is to surrender . The Americans evidently knew nothing about such a rule , but kept on fighting . Some of them , of course , were killed , but , hiding out there in the woods , they played havoc with the advancing Germans . This story shows how the Americans fight : A certain machine gunner rigged his gun alongside a thicket through which he hoped to get advancing Germans . Just then a stray shell blew off his right hand . The German column , to his despair , he saw passing out of range of his gun , which he was unable to move with one hand . He drew his automatic , and , firing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the line of his machine gun , which he turned loose with telling effect . Two other Americans , lost in the woods , came up , attracted by the firing , and got , the wounded gunner back to his own lines . Captured but Get Away . Here 's another little story that sounds like fiction , but every word of it is true . An American Corporal was captured by a German Captain at the head of his detachment . The Captain sent the American , in care of two German privates , back across l e Manic in a canvas boat used by the boche in crossing the river . The Corporal rocked the boat , upsetting it , and , swimming back to the south hank of the river , made his way unharmed to American regimental headquarters . As he was reporting to an American Colonel in walked one of our men with the German Captain who had captured the American Corporal three hours before . As they recognized each other the Corporal broke into a laugh and the German Captain said : " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capt and sent back across the Marne killed their three guards with their ba ? e Fends and got back to their own lines after swimming the Marne . Seven other Americans , including n Lieutenant , were taken over the Marne by the Germans . The Lieutenant knocked one guard down with a stick of wood , got his gun and disarmed the other guards . The seven Americans started to swim the Marne , when a boche machine gun opened on them . The Lieutenant and one American were killed . The others got back by swimming under water . Fight and Then Fight Some More , I give these instances because nothing else tells so well the spirit of the American fighters . They have n't got all the training of seasoned veterans , they do n't know how to retreat , but they have " guts . " They do n't know when to quit . Caught oat there in the woods by the Germans advancing three ways , they did n't try to get back , but stayed where they were because that 's where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germans . There in the woods , without food or water in most cases , and swept by a merciless shellfire , often wearing gas masks for hours at a time , hundreds of Americans stuck , fighting sometimes singly , and generally in bunches of three or four . They fought until their ammunition gave out , and then fought with captured guns . The Germans made their first advance through the woods at 3 o'clock Monday morning . It . was 9 o'clock that night before the Americans came back , with the boche , . fleeing before them , and were joined by their comrades , who had borne their part so well . Perhaps our boys would have driven the boche back on the Marne anyhow , but I happen to know that the knowledge of the presence of their comrades still fighting in the woods against such odds lent a punch to their successful counterattack . It must be remembered that these soldiers never saw a battle before . I'hey'clo not know many of the rules , but they do know one  --  fight as long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more . In Broadway parlance , the show staged by the Americans east of Chateau-Thierry has been a howling success . It may be remembered that the show they staged northwest of Chateau-Thierry was the same sort of a performance . The French have now changed the name of Bois Belleau to Bois de la Brigade de Marines . Germane Again Try on ( Marne . July ** and French troops are now engaged in bloody fighting south of the Marne on a line running north of St. Agnan and La Chapelle . After a lull the Germans launched an attack last night after bringing fresh troops across the . Marne . The allied lines held firmly against this onslaught . Again this morning the fighting became intense when an allied counterattack met a. new German attack . The fighting eased off later , but again this afternoon , in a pouring rain , the Germans tried to wrest the heights south of the Marne away from the Americans and French .

After being balked by the Americans on Monday , when they were driven back over the Marne as far east as Jaulgonne , and by the Americans and French yesterday , when the enemy lines were shoved back- toward the Marne south of Dormans , they are now makL ing fresh efforts to deepen the salient south of the stream . A very essential part of the German program is to maintain one end of the salient south of the Marne to ' serve as ? a pivot on which to swing it they can got further toward Epernay . The allied troops launched an attack this evening against the ' Germans southeast et Dormans independent , of the fighting along the St. Agnan-La Chapelle line . Every hour fresh stories , of American heroism and bravery . are , told . Despite losses and constant bombardment , ' the spirit and strength of our boys , never in battle before , hold up , . and they are fighting away side by side with their veteran French comrades . The French officers can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans ' behavior . There have been . rain and thunder storms this morning . The allied armies are in high spirits over the failure of the German drive to accomplish any ' of its objects so far . ' A gain ' of three or four kilometers in the Champagne against Chalons and a Salient driven to Ouiiley , between Dormans. and Rheims , in the fight for Epernay , are the total gains for the German high command , except the presence of a German force across the Marne south of Dormans , a gain now of doubtful Value . The Allies ' lines now are much ' stronger than when the Germans started the drive on Monday morning , and the spirit of the allied soldiers marking the vigor of their counterattacks may make the total result of Germany 's great effort a net loss instead of a gain . A good idea of the measure of success of the boche drive is the fact that they were ordered to make Montmirail by Monday night . Americans arid French are bow holding this part of the drive three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans accomplished may be seen by understanding that the German plan was to make -a great converging drive on both sides of Rheims , like a great scissors , cutting their way through to Chalons and Epernay . But two points of the scissors , . at ChateauThierry and near Suippes , fell on our troops , as it happened , and the points of the scissors . were held there , with the boche evidently unable to cut further . The boche drive has used the majority of its shock troops , but Still has some left for other pushes in the same directions or somewhere else with the ' hope of catching a weak spot . The next two days . will show more of the Kaiser 's plans . Suffice it'to say , up to the present the Crown Prince has registered one more failure . The deepest gain was toward Epernay . The next few days will demonstrate whether they will hold that . The small gains made east of . Rheims are adjudged valueless from a military standpoint , although dearly bought . Stories of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories of the terrible price paid by the Germans in crossing the Marne . ? It is safe to state that thousands were lost . in crossing the river . Canvas boats drawn across by pulley cables were used in front of the Americans . In many cases our guns shot away the cables , ? and the boats were swept downstream , the Marne being swollen by recent rains . On the front between Chateau-Thierry and Dormans , thirteen crack German divisions were used in ' that Dart ' Of the drive nearest Paris . Prisoner s tell how . badly they . were shot , up . Past experience has . shown that too much dependence can not . be placed upori theories ' about the morale of the Germans , yet one is struck with the great spirit of growing dissatisfaction on the part of the troops attacking .

Many prisoners expressed sentiments of revolt against the high command . This is the first time this sentiment has been generally prevalent . Strong resentment is expressed by reserve officers against the officers of the German regular army . The reserve officers , who , generally speaking , led the attacks , said that the regulars stayed in the rear . One captured German officer , formerly a professor at Posen , said : " We can not express publicly ? our indignation because these ' officers of the rear ' take notes of us , and would take part in courts-martial , should we give free course to our feelings . But the war will end some day , and then all these people will have accounts to settle with us. "
