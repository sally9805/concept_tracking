 | The National Insurance Act , * which was passed by Parliament in the winter of 1911-1912 and which will go into effect on July 15 , 1912 , or at some time between that date and January 1 , 1913 , to be fixed by an order in council , is worthy of consideration for several reasons . In the first place it is a factor to be reckoned with in English politics . Most observers agree that the tendency of the administration to lose recent by-elections is due largely to the introduction of the new measure into party controversy by the opposition . Affecting , as it does , both employers and employed as well as the influential medical profession , the act has naturally aroused much dissatisfaction and some opposition especially in the interim between its passage and the time it will go into effect . Moreover , the conservative instincts of the majority of Englishmen lead them unconsciously to distrust so radical a departure from the accustomed social order . In spite of the fact , therefore , that the Unionist leaders expressed their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduced , it was scarcely to be expected that they would resist the temptation to make political capital in the course of the discussions that followed . They defend their action on the ground that Mr. Lloyd George has not incorporated the principles they favor in the terms of his bill . Mr. Bonar Law , the new leader of the Unionist party , even went so far on one occasion as to say on the floor of the House of Commons that he would undertake to repeal the act or at least to modify it very seriously should he come into office . But this assertion was immediately set down in English political slang as another " howler " to the credit of a leader who , to say the least , has not yet achieved any considerable distinction . The chances are that when the differences of opinion as to the details of administration are compromised the act will obtain general acceptance as a permanent factor in English life much in the same way as has the old age pension scheme . In any case , unless one has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the measure must  | be left for future consideration . It is as a proposed scheme for dealing with certain social problems that we shall describe the general provisions of the act and consider them in this article . The National Insurance Act undertakes to offer partial remedies for two social ills , sickness and unemployment . In dealing with these questions it is also inevitably concerned indirectly with such other questions as poverty , sanitation , and the like . Since , however , distinct schemes are proposed for dealing with sickness and unemployment , it will be well to give them separate treatment . Naturally the experience of Germany was taken into account when Mr. Lloyd George and his associates undertook the task of framing a bill which would compel every English wage earner to insure himself against sickness and yet would not interfere too much with the voluntary societies for that purpose already existing . In several important respects the measure finally adopted resembles that which has been in operation for a number of years in Germany . Both schemes make insurance compulsory , and both are national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widely . In Germany , for example , the old age pensions are paid out of the sickness and invalidity fund , whereas in England the imperial exchequer votes about ? 13,000,000 annually for that purpose . The result is that more of the money contributed to the insurance fund in England is available for the insured laborers . Again , in Germany the fund available for paying benefits in the case of sickness is obtained entirely from contributions levied upon laborers and their employers , while in England the state contributes an additional sum . Furthermore , in Germany the insured population is classified , and the benefits are apportioned according to the rate of wages . In England no such distinctions will be made . Finally , from an administrative point of view , the German scheme differs from the English law in providing a separate machinery for collecting and distributing the sickness and invalidity benefits . While the general scheme has been patterned upon that in force in Germany , therefore , the details have been modified to suit English conditions and in some cases to conform to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are colossal . There are in round numbers about 45,000,000 people in Great Britain . It is estimated that about 15,500,000 of these are engaged in manual  | labor . The incomes of 3,500,000 of the remainder are so small that they are relieved of the income tax . Of these 19,000,000 people 14,700,000 , it is estimated , will be insured against sickness under the new act . It is expected that 1,600,000 will insure themselves voluntarily under its provisions for that purpose , while the remaining 13,100,000 will be compelled to insure by law . Of this number , for whom the state will make insurance obligatory , it is estimated that 9,200,000 will be men and 3,900-000 women . Between four and five million persons are already insured in the various friendly societies . The new law , therefore , will more than double the number of insured persons in England . Moreover , these figures give a very imperfect notion of the far reaching results that will inevitably follow when the law goes into effect . The local officers who will administer the act will deal with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man in the kingdom . The state , in fact , practically guarantees to every man , woman , and child of its inhabitants medicine and medical attendance as well as sustenance , and that without pauperization . How is it possible to carry out , even approximately , such a stupendous undertaking ? The first problem , naturally , is to find the money . The National Insurance Act proposes that this task shall become the joint undertaking of the laborers , the employers , and the state . The proportionate share for each of the contributing parties varies . In general , for male laborers it is provided that the state shall pay 2d. per week , the laborer himself 4d. , and his employer 3d . In the case of women the state pays 2d. , the employer 3d. , and the laborer 3d . However , in case the daily wage of a laborer does not exceed 1s. 6d. , the employee is exempt , the state pays 1d. extra , and the employer has to find the balance . When the wage does not exceed 2s. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1d. , and the employer the remainder . When the wage is between 2s. and 2s. 6d , the state will pay 2d. , the laborer 3d. , and the employer the remainder . This scale is to be modified . however , in cases where the employee is under twenty-one years of age or where board and lodging are furnished by the employer in addition to the money wage . But in every case the burden of seeing that both contributions are paid rests upon the employer . It is his duty to ascertain whether he has any persons in his em- ploy who ought to be insured under the terms of the act . If so he must purchase the stamps necessary to cover the amount of the contributions of both himself and his employee and must affix them to cards with which the employees will be provided for that purpose . He is thereupon permitted to retain the share of the employee from the wage of the latter provided he does so immediately . But he can not later recover any contributions which he has failed to collect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is the duty of the insured person to see that the cards are deposited with the proper authorities . Every person regularly employed whose annual wage does not exceed ? 160 per year is required to be insured , no matter what the character of his employment may be . Thus clergymen and teachers , for example , would come under this provision unless they have been previously otherwise provided for . Every person engaged in any form of manual labor is required to be insured no matter what his wage maybe . The term employment is construed broadly , so that a cabman driving the vehicle of another , for example , though not paid a regular wage , is required to be insured , and the owner of the vehicle is responsible for the contribution . If the income of any insured person should later be increased so as to make it greater than ? 160 per annum , such a person , if he so desires , can still remain a beneficiary of the insurance scheme as a voluntary contributor . But in that case the employer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person will pay the full amount . The benefits which an insured person is to receive in return for his contributions are of several kinds . In the first place , should he become sick he is entitled to free medicine and medical attendance by the physician of his choice . Of course this freedom of choice is limited to a certain extent . The committee charged with the administration of the law in a given locality will prepare and have ready a panel of the physicians in that locality who offer for that class of work . It is the right of the insured person to select at intervals to be agreed upon by the committee a physician from this panel . In case the physician so selected agrees to serve , the person who has selected him becomes his official patient until the period for which he was selected has expired . The state under- takes to see that the physician is remunerated and that the patient is furnished with medicines prescribed . Not only is an insured person entitled to free medicines and medical attention . He is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remainder of his life , or as long as it shall be necessary , should he contract tuberculosis or any other disease that the Local Government Board may designate . These sanatoria , however , are not to be built from the insurance funds . The existing institutions are to be utilized , and , where it is necessary , the imperial government will co-operate with the local authorities to build as many sanatoria as shall be needed . The insurance committee merely has to undertake the task of providing the patient with a place in such an institution . Of course the committee will exercise its discretion in giving such treatment and will no doubt be guided largely by the advice of the medical members of the committee . In order to supply his needs while he is out of employment on account of sickness , or the needs of his family should he be placed in a sanatorium , it is provided that an insured person shall receive a weekly stipend of 10s. ? 7s. 6d. in the case of women ? which shall begin on the fourth day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case he should be ill for a longer period a stipend of 5s. per week for man or woman shall be paid throughout the period of illness . Before either of these stipends can be collected , however , it is necessary that a specified number of contributions shall have been made previously , twenty-six as preliminary to the 10s. per week and 104 to the 5s. per week . An insured married woman or the wife of a man who is insured is to be allowed a 30s. maternity benefit at the time of confinement . The married woman who is herself insured will be entitle , : to an additional sickness or disablement benefit at the usual rate for women during the period of her confinement . The sickness , disablement , and maternity benefits will not be paid to a pers. who is being cared for in a hospital or sanatorium , however . though the two former may be paid to those dependent upon the insured person . Furthermore , the committee is to have the right to pay the maternity benefit in cash or otherwise at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competent physician or midwife shall be in attendance upon the case .  | The above-mentioned are the " minimum benefits , " that is they are guaranteed to every insured person by the government . In addition to these an approved society , if it has an available surplus , may grant to its members additional benefits such as an increase in the convalescence pension . No such society , however , can pay death benefits from the funds collected under this scheme . One of the interesting features of this scheme is the attempt to make insurance compulsory and yet to leave it to the individual to choose the society in which he will insure , the societies themselves being purely voluntary organizations . It is true that the Post Office will undertake to collect the contributions of those persons who decline to affiliate themselves with any society . But the law encourages all persons who have to be insured to join a society , since the Post Office merely pays to the contributor in case of illness the sum which has been placed to his individual credit by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state . In other words , the Post Office assumes no risk but merely assists a contributor to lay up in store against a time of need . The societies , on the other hand , in return for the contributions undertake to guarantee to the insured person certain benefits whether he has himself contributed sufficient funds for that purpose or not . Before a society will be accepted as fulfilling the requirements of the law it must have at least five thousand contributing members and must have the approval of the Insurance Commissioners . In order to obtain this approval the society must not be carried on for a profit , and its affairs , including the election of the committee of management , must be under the control of its members . The only exception permitted to this rule is in the case of societies promoted by employers for the benefit of their employees in which the former are liable for a substantial contribution or are responsible for the solvency of the society . Societies having fewer members than five thousand may , and if they refuse shall be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The resources of the allied societies , in that case , are to be liable for the benefits that fall upon all the societies in the group . To co-operate with the approved societies in administering the insurance scheme a system of commissions and committees is to be inaugurated . There will be four sets of Insurance Commis- sioners , one for each geographical division of the United Kingdom , each to have control of the health fund of the country it represents . The work of these commissioners is to be co-ordinated by a joint committee under a chairman who shall have a seat in the House of Commons in order to answer questions in that body . The commissioners also have the task of attending to the collection of the contributions to the fund and of bringing into exist-ence and prescribing regulations for the local insurance committees . One such committee must be appointed for each county or county borough , the membership and method of appointment being left largely in the hands of the commissioners . The law provides , however , that these committees shall not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that three-fifths of their membership shall come from the insured persons resident in the county , that one-fifth shall be chosen by the local government in the community , that a certain number shall be women , and that a certain number shall be members of the medical profession . These committees have the appointment of district committees for still smaller areas who shall cooperate with them in administering in detail the payment of the benefits and related matters . One of the most troublesome questions with which the framers of the law had to deal was the relation of the members of the medical profession to the scheme . About ten years ago the British Medical Association organized itself on a more democratic basis than formerly and undertook a reform of the abuses that had crept into the system of contract practice in vogue among the poorer classes . There is not space here to enter into the details of these abuses . It is sufficient to say that , owing to the unscrupulous methods of certain societies , co-operating with physicians who frequently had no better training than they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention in many cases received very inadequate care . The medical association had made some progress toward remedying these conditions before the insurance bill was introduced . The doctors were naturally reluctant , therefore , to see their plans destroyed and a totally new scheme put in their place . The result was that while the bill was pending there took place what was practically a strike of the physicians . The members of the profession brought forward the following demand , ( 1 ) that no person having an in- come of more than ten pounds per week should be entitled to a medical benefit , ( 2 ) that the patient should be permitted to have the physician of his choice , subject to the consent of the doctor to serve , ( 3 ) that the medical benefits should be administered by the insurance committees instead of by the friendly societies , ( 4 ) that the method of remunerating the physicians ? that is whether by the head or by the cases attended ? should be left to the majority of the medical members of the district @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the remuneration should be what the profession may regard as adequate in view of the work done , and ( 6 ) that the profession should have adequate representation on the local committees . To a certain extent the doctors ultimately won their fight on most of these points . Free choice of a physician is granted with certain restrictions already indicated ; the profession has ample representation on the various boards and committees ; and the medical benefits are to be administered by the committees instead of by the societies . The other points at issue are for the most part left for settlement to the physicians and committees who will have to deal with local conditions . While the National Insurance Act may be rightly regarded as a stupendous attempt to promote the health of the English people , it is , nevertheless , not expected that it will interfere with the work of the local health and sanitation boards already in existence . In fact the act provides that where it can be shown that sickness results from the failure of the local authorities to enforce existing sanitary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the amount expended in benefits on account of such illness . In this way it is expected that the act will operate to promote better sanitary conditions at the same time that it alleviates the poverty that is the result of sickness . The second part of the National Insurance Act deals with the question of unemployment . This part of the act , however , is admittedly an experiment and is limited for the present to laborers in certain trades . Broadly speaking these trades include bricklayers , carpenters , most joiners , painters , plasterers , paper hangers , all men engaged in making or repairing machinery or in operating machine tools , all men engaged in ship building , in making embankments , canals , and other permanent works , platelayers , iron founders , sawyers , carriage builders , and laborers  | working with them . Every such laborer is required to contribute 2 ? d. per week , which , with 2 ? d. contributed by his employer and 1 2/3d. added by the state , makes up the total contributionrequired . The board of trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ odd 2/3d. , so that 6d. per week will be left available to pay benefits . The benefits are to be alloted under a modified deposit system , that is , a laborer when unemployed can draw one week 's benefit to the amount of 7s. for every five weeks he has contributed . In other words , an insured person is entitled to draw out in the form of benefits 7s. for every 1s. ? d. that he has paid into the fund himself . It is provided also that if a laborer does not have occasion to receive the benefits to which he would have been entitled he may at any time after he has reached the age of sixtyfive years draw from the fund a sum equal to the total amount of his own contributions with 2 ? per cent interest on the same . One of the most vexing questions that will arise in the administration of this part of the act will be as to what constitutes unemployment . In order to meet this difficulty the act provides that when an insured person presents his claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have two alternatives . He may offer him suitable employment , or he may enter his name upon the list of those drawing unemployment benefits . But the question will arise as to what constitutes suitable employment . Should the laborer and the local exchange be unable to agree on this point the matter is to be left to a board of referees which is provided for in the act . There are certain kinds of employment , however , which a workman has a statutory right to refuse . He may , for example , refuse to accept employment at lower wages or on less favorable conditions than he has formerly had , unless his previous experience has demonstrated that he was incompetent for the work . Again , a laborer can not be sent to another district at less than the customary wage for his trade in that district . The government has no intention of inaugurating a strikebreaking scheme . Indeed the law will materially strengthen the hands of the unions . The members of the unions will get their insurance against sickness and against unemployment that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much lower rate than they have been accustomed to pay in the past .
