txt There has been some question whether the Administration at Washington in its determinations of policy has shown a good understanding of the Mexican character or has made due allowance for its peculiarities . However that may he . none of us ought to have any difficulty in understanding our British friends . or the motives of their policy . For centuries the foundation principle of Great Britain 's foreign policy has been the extension of her trade and the safeguarding of her commercial interests in all parts of the world . That being perfectly well known . we can understand why the British Foreign Office through the British Minister in Mexico maintains relations of apparent friendship with President 111:ERTA . The investments of English capital in Mexico , though less than our own . are very great . Ht ? F.P.T.1 is the man nominally and actually in Power at the capital . Our English friends treat with him . therefore . no doubt feeling that . though the operations of the revolutionary groups are threatening . nevertheless the protection of English interests in Mexico will he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of friendly relations with him as President of the republic . This attitude explains with sufficient clearness the behavior and the language of the British Minister . Sir LIONEL CARDEN . It by no means excuses , it does not even palliate , some expressions attributed to Sir LIONEL .. If indeed the British representative at the capital of any important European power should permit himself such freedom of discourse about the internal affairs of the country to which he is accredited , his passports would be handed to him within the hour . The British Minister , for instance , protested that he saw no reason why Gen. HUERTA " should be disPlaCi 'd " for another man whose abilities " were yet to be tried. ? ' and that safety for Mexico could he had only by " punitive and remedial methods , " a strong man and a statesman of no " small ability . " All this is sufficiently contemptuous of President MYER-FA , since it is coupled with the statement that he sees no reason why the present disturbed conditions should not continue indefinitely . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the task . The British : Holster 's comments upon our policy toward Mexico . while so much out of place and so inais  --  reet that if we were touchy in such matters they might be made a cause of offense , need not give us any very serious concern . If called to account by his Government he would probably he able , to make a diplomatic disclaimer . The more serious aspect of the matter is the appearance , though we trust not the reality , of British obstruction to the policy we are pursuing in Mexico . We are entirely confident that the Foreign Office will not knowingly put any obstacles in the way of President V . S0 ) .7 in his endeavors to bring about peace through the action of the Mexicans themselves . All European Governments have in the most friendly manner many times recognized our superior prerogative to use our good offices in our own way for the settlement of disturbances in our sister republics of the New World . Nor is there the slightest likelihood that any co-operation on the part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save in the form of friendly advice . It has not been forgotten , we suppose , that in 1800 , when we were invited to join Great Britain and ' France in addressing an identic note to the warring Governments in Mexico . President 131 . ? CHANA : : replied that ' the general policy of the United States was " opposed to .. any inter " ference. especially the joint interfer ? ence. of other powers in the do ? mestic affairs of an independent na " tion . " That continues to be our policy . At the same time , it can not be denied that if foreign interest ; call imperatively for protection in Mexico ; protection must be given , and if it can not be assured by us we can not 7-9as911gbly object to measures 4roperly limited to that end taken by other powers . The need , therefore , or sound judgment and of firmness at Wafaing , ton is evident . The British representative in Mexico is well advised when he says that the chief need of Mexico is a strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is right in his view of the nature of the opposition to HUERTA as " merely a conglomeration of out " breaks here and there , unrelated " except as they are the outgrowth of " general social unrest . " There lies Mexico 's danger and our embarrassment . We have declined to deal with HUERTA and we can not have any dealings with revolutionary chiefs . who are hardly better than heads of bandit gangs . The situation is not without its anxieties , but our policy has been based upon two principles . absolutely sound and right , as to which the President has the united support of the country  --  restoration of peace in Mexico and the avoidance of any occasion for our intervention . These purposes we have made known to all the world Success is not certain , but there is very substantial ground for the hope that both ends win he attained . Obviously , much depends upon the behavior of the Mexicans themselves . something . too . upon the course pursued by other powers in Mexico . There is no reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power would knowingly and with purpose take any position that would embarrass us or diminish the probability of President W/LSON 'S success in securing the restoration of peace without interference on our part .
