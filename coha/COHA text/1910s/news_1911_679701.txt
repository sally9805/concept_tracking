txt After a recess of ten days both houses of the Legislature met again to-night . While it had been expected that the session would drag for two or three weeks longer at least , the legislative leasers To-night announced that every effort would be matte to bring the session to a close by the end of the present week . Such an early adjournment would involve an attempt to jam through the Cullen-Foley New York City Charter bill with its objectionable features just three days after it is printed in its amended form , and without prior hearing . Action of that sort , on a measure of such importance , is without precedent in the legfSlative annals of this State . f : ' Senator Cullen and Assemblyman Foley , tin behalf of the two Cities Committees , reported to-night the Charter bills , with the amendments drafted at the secret ( Meetings of the Joint Charter Committee in the Hotel Knickerbocker during the last two weeks . The Charter bill was ordered reprinted with its amendments , and it is expected will be , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It can be passed under the law on Friday at ape earliest unless Gov . Dix should send in an emergency message . ? The opponents of the Cullen-Foley Charter bill declared to-night that if TamMa.ny should bring up the proposed Charter to-morrow it would be beaten in both houses . There is every prospect that the Republicans in both branches of the Legislature will present an unbroken front against the Cullen-Foley bill . From statements made by some of the independent Democrats to-night the Democratic leaders will be confronted with detection 3n the ranks of the majority . " I shah not vote for the Charter unless the Mayor 's absolute veto in transit matters is eliminated and the Civil Service chapter changed so as to leave with the State Civil Service Committee the power of supervision over the municipal Civil Service Board in New York City , " said Senator Franklin D. Roosevelt of Dutchess , former insurgent leader . . Senator Frank M. Loomis of Buffalo said that he opposed the Charter unless the Civil Service chapter was revised along the lines suggested by Senator Roosevelt . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Senator Loomis . " What this bill would do would be to give to the State of New York two kinds of civil ser.vice resolution , one kind for New York City to suit Tammany Hall and another kind for the rest of the State . " Senator George B. Burd of Buffalo , who &so; is reported to be opposed to the Charter in its present form , did not come to the Capitol to-night , and a majority of the Democratic Senators from Brooklyn who , it is believed , will object to the Mayor 's absolute veto were also absent . In the Assembly only a score or so of members were present . Assemblyman Artemas Ward , a Republican , representing the Twenty-fifth New York District , was asked whether the amendments made by the Joint Charter Committee would meet the objections of those who had opposed the Cullen-Foley bill in the past . " The whole matter resolves around the transit situation in New York City and the Mayor 's absolute veto , " said Mr. Ward . " In fact , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not believe the Mayor would approve the proposed Ch.ster if that extraordinary and unprecedented grant of power is taken out . But I am opposed to that provision , and do not see how anybody can vote for a Charter bill containing it . i " think the Charter bill will be defeated . " Announcement was made in both houses of the Legislature to-day that the joint caucus of the Republican Senators and Assemblymen , which had been scheduled for to-morrow , would be postponed until later in the week , or such time as the readers shall be ready to move the Charter bill for final passage . Only a handful Of Republicans are at the Capitol tonight , the up-State primaries , which are to be held to-morrow , demanding their presence at home . The Republicans will oppose the Charter on the ground that any charter proposing such a radical readjustment of the powers and duties of elected officers should not go into effect until after another city election has been held . There is no doubt that in the meantime Tammany 's Charter enthusiasts will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough Republican votes to make up for the expected defection . There is little prospect that they will Succeed , for at the present stage any Republican failing to enter the caucus and to be bound by its pledges would read himself out of his party . The following statement was issued tonight by Robert S. Binkerd , Secretary of the City Club of New York , and Laurence A. Tanzer , Chairman of the Charter Committee of the Citizens ' Union : " The Chairman of the Assembly Cities Committee has refused to grant a hearing upon the final draft of the proposed new Charter , to which 159 printed pages of amendments were infra:need in the Legislature to-night . It has already been publicly charged that those responsible for the former draft sought to mislead citizens as to Its contents , and to jam through a new charter under false pretenses. - " The amendments introduced to-night , taken in connection with the statement published this morning , would indicate that these tactics have not been abandoned . In the morning 's statement , as published , no mention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To-night 's amendments , however , contain the followig : , .. " ' Insert Section ** action on annual estimate . ' ? - " This section then provides that the Mayor may veto items of the annual budget , and gives the Board of - Estimate five days in which such veto may be overridden . i . " Tnis section further contains this provision : Upon such reconsideration but one ' vote snail be had . ' " Again , with regard to the Mayor 's suspension veto o : , resolutions involvinig the appropriations the Charter revisers have provided that the Board of Estimate may vote but once on overriding such a veto . The committee 's statement , as published in this morning 's TIMES , said : " The Department of Docks and Ferries rsdnains as no 's , const ; tuted and the lircvisions of the existing Charter requirin thc. , advertising of a hearing upon a Vri-pused lease of dock property are continned.

" We respectfully and earnestly urge the Legislature to overrule the decision of the Assembly Cities Committee Chairman and see that a hearing upon this Charter as revised is afforded to the citizens of New York City . " The provisions here called to public attention are only a few of many important features . No mention has been made of the evidence of extreme haste found In amendments making sentences without sense . Except as above indicated , there has not been time for a careful examination of the Charter as revised . Practically the only important business beside the presentation of the Charter amendments at the session to-night was the introduction of the Congressional Reapportionment bill . The special committee - had labored patiently over the carving out of Congressional districts in New York City until late this afternoon . Senator Frawley , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it be sent to third reading without reference . Senator Stephen J. Stilwell of the Bronx , who , while a Tammany Senator , is not well pleased with the manner-in which his borough has - been ' treated by the Reapportionment Committee , thought the bill ought to go to the committee of the . whole for debate so that members generally could learn what it contains . He withdl'ew his objection when assured by Senator Primley that there would be ample opportunity after the bill had been printed and before it is put on final passage for any member who so desires to . read it through . On that understanding , ' said Minority Leader Brackett , rising-in his seat , " ' we of the minority shall not ' protest against the bill going to - third reading at ' this time .

At the regular monthly meeting of the Republican Club last night a resolution was introduced by Martin Saxe and unanimously adopted protesting - against the passage of the proposed new city Charter at the present session of the Legislature .
