txt Lord Sydenham asked the Government in the House of . Lords today If the particular circumstances attending the sinking of the Stephan ? and other British or neutral vessels by the German submarine U-53 had been received- and if these circumstances were in conformity with the pledge of the German Government th.it in accordance with the general principles of visit and search and destruction of merchant vessels recognized by international law such ' vessels , both within and without the area declared a naval zone , shall not be sunk without warning and without saving human life unless the ship attempts to escape or to offer resistance . " Lord Sydenham quoted the statement I of President Wilson to Congress in April I last when Mr. Wilson said that unless the Imperial German Government immediately declared and effected an abandonment of its present method of warfare against passenger and freightcarrying vessels the United States Government would have no choice but to sever diplomatic relations with the Government of the German Empire . Those were very strong and plain words , lie said . corning from me ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ l the Marquis of Crewe had made the yen ' serious statement that since the-German pledge was given nu fewer than seven ships had been stink in circumstances which directly vio- ' lated the pledge . In the sinking of those ships at least 46 lives were lost . Therefore , before the recent exploit of the ** the pledge given by the German Government had been torn to shreds and the Government of the United States had made no sign what- , ever . Lord Sydenham said he did not know whether the statement was correct that the Stephano had received her first warning bj : a shot fired into her hull . Another ship sunk was a neutral , bound from neutral port to neutral port . Her case was exactly one of those which ! President Wilson had expressly condemned and barred . To sink her without ascertaining whether she contained contraband or enemy property was an outrage on all neutrals and an outrage committed under the eyes of the powerful neutral which had described herself as the representative of the rights of neutrals all over the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dutch , Danish , and even Spanish  --  went on almost every day . The Norwegians had lost eighteen vessels this month.1 What must the small neutrals think of their powerful representative ? The Germans had gone on sinking from day to day every unarmed ship their submarines came across . The only difference they had made was that they did not now appear to torpedo at sight . They destroyed ships just as before , but did not commit murder quite so frequently . Lord Sydennain added that on Aug. 17 ) the Marquis of Crewe spoke of a time when it would be possible on behalf . not oily of this country , but of nil allies , to make a ' definite declaration of the pulley it was proposed to pursue with regard to these monstrous proceedings . It was in the interest of the Allies and of unhappy neutrals who had no champion that such 0 , declaration should be made with the least possible delay . Lord Beresford said he had always thought the German Government had it in mind eventually to bring the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came Into the peace conference it would be a considerable asset to Germany . But ror the gallantry of the American naval service , he said , lives would have been lost during the German submarine operations off . the American coast . That being so , the United States was rather aiding and abetting this shocaing state of affairs . Had not the United States sent warships to save lives the Overmans would have broken their pledge . He hoped the Secretary for Foreign Affairs would not allow the matter to rest as it was . The submarine menace was getting more serious every day , and he thought the Allies were bound to take notice of the fact that it did not appear to be quite within the bounds of neutrality as far as the United States was concerned . Foreign Secretary Grey said : We have no understanding with the United States Government as to what ; information they are going to get , or : what they will do with the information when they have obtained it . All we can do is to obtain information for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and these sources in this case I imagine are officers in charge of the merchant vessels gunk , or passengers . In one case at any rate , aboard the merchant ves-I sels , all of whom have survived and to whom we , can have access and from ! whom we can get their individual statements of what happened . " That is what is being done on the other side , I understand . Full reports , I trust , will reach the Admiralty in due course as to the statements of survivors , and when these reports are received I can not imagine any reason why they should not be made public in this country , or that there will be any reluctance on the part of the Admiralty or among the departments concerned to making public the facts , which we shall have got for ourselves as to how the vessels were sunk and treated ' by the German submarines . " Pledgee Broken Elsewhere . " Lord Sydenham , " continued Viscount Grey , " quoted statements made by Lord Crewe in August of the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave a pledge to the United States Government in May of last year , up to the middle of August in circumstances which were apparently ' not in a ... e.re3rdance with that pledge , which included firing torpedoes I at ' ships wIthout- ? warnink rand - insufficiently providing for the safety of the ' crews or . . pr ? saetgers.when.the ships were sunk . i am sure the Admiralty ( indeed , I think it has been made public ) can multiply instances which ha'e occurred since the middle of August and are occurring every week of allied or neutral merchant vessels having torpedoes fired at them without warning , and in some cases loss of life occurring from crews being placed in open boats as the only chance of safety when the vessel is sunk , " These instances are occurring in different parts of the world . If he asks whether they oe-eurred off the Unite.1 States coast the other day , that is a matter on which I can not pronounce any opinion until we get the facts ; but if he wishes to know whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and we have published instances quite lately of its occurring in the Mediterra-1 nean and elsewhere . I see no use at this moment of discussing the question . The pledge was one which passed between the Governwent of Germany and the Government of , the ' United States . It is not a pledge i given to us . I do not think that at the present moment we can do any good whatever by discussing the question of what the policy of the United States Is Or ought to be toward the German Government in regard to that subject . That is a matter I 'm the United States itself . I do not think allied interests or the interests of these merchant vessels could be served by raising at y discussion in this country at the present moment with retard to a roster which Is one h. - tween the United States Government and the Merman Government . and which is a mattes , of course , in which it is for the United States Government . not for us , to decide what is the policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case require that the United States Government should take. ? ' Lord Svdenham asked when the prom- ! reed declaration with regard to these ; outrages would be made . Viscount Grey said : " I did not know this was going to ; be raised . and I have not had the op- ; portunity of referring to what Lord Crewe said . It is a matter which would require further statement and some con- ' atderation "
