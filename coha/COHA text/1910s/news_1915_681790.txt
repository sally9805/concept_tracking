txt Through I its Ambassador in Washington , the ! German Government today officially expressed to the United States " deep i regret that the events of the war had led to the loss of so many American lives , " but this action has not relieved ? the tension here , nor has it appeared 1 to modify the impression , which is I gradually becoming a conviction , that the issue presented in the Lusitania horror must be met by'this Governs ment in a positive way . But no word is forthcoming from the White House , which has assumed the exclusive handling of the problem , as to what course will be pursued to show the indignation felt over the destruction ' of the Lusitania . and with it the sacrifice of the lives of American men . women , and children . There is reason to believe . however , that the demands that this Government is expected to make will give Germany the opportunity of adjusting the matter on a basis that will avert war . The seclusion of President Wilson , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the loss of the Lusitania , was continued today up to the time he left for Philadelphia to deliver an address tonight to newly enfranchised foreign-born citizens . In tip more than three days since he learned of the sinking of the great Cunarder the President has seen no member of his Cabinet except his sonin-law , the Secretary of the Treasury , who dined at the White House last night , and it is said that there was no conversation between the President and Mr. on the relations of Germany and the United States . Sees No Visitors . Today the President shut himself in his study and would see no one , not even Senator Stone , Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations , who called at the executive offices . Senator Stone had a long talk with Secretary Tumulty , the only official who has been in touch with the President since the sinking of the Lusitania , and afterward reiterated the significant opinion that Congress would not be called in extra session . It has , become a matter of comment here that the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his Secretary of State at this trying period , when the international relations of the country are in such a perilous condition . No word of advice has been sought from Secretary Bryan . It is the general impression here that he is as ignorant as the rest of the American people as to what opinion the President has formed of the killing of Americans in the destruction of the Lusitania , and as to what explicit measures the President regards as necessary to meet the grave question that fonfronts the Government . Naturally this situation has brought various suggestions offered in explanation of the President 's failure to consult Mr. Bryan . President in Supreme Control . Of these suggestions that which has gained the most currency is that the President wishes to demonstrate to the country that he is In supreme and sole charge of the conduct of the foreign relations of the Government , and that he is not being influenced in any way by what Mr. Bryan may have to propose . Those who argue along this line contend that Mr. Bryan is unpopular throughout the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign policy , and that the people have no confidence that he would do the thing most needed to uphold the national dignity in a situation such as now confronts the Administration . And the argument is capped with the prediction that if the country should become involved in war Mr. Bryan would have to quit the Cabinet . Nothing has come from the White House to give credence to a suggestion of this character . What President Wilson thinks in this connection is a profound secret , and , judged from all that Can be learned , a secret that is shared by nobody . Sentiment Against War . Nothing beyond the fact that the President has not seen Mr. Bryan since the Lusitania disaster is known to indicate that Mr. Wilson believes it a wise course to get his bearings in this situation without Mr. Bryan 's assistance . Cautious remarks of some officials make it appear that they are certain that the President will not ' call an extra session of Congress . Although it seems inconsistent with the statement that the President has not communicated with anybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason for the belief that a hint has come from the White House that Mr. Wilson does not regard it as wise to bring Congress to ' Washington to discuss the-situation . This circumstance is significant when taken in connection with the fact that the senders of a great majority of the flood of telegrams that has descended on the White House since the Iiner was sunk deprecate the idea that the response to Germany should be a declaration of war or radical action that would make war certain . THE TIMES correspondent was told that NI per cent of ? these messages were against war . Great Flood of Telegrams . The - telegrams relating to the Lusitania disaster have been pouring into the White House telegraph room since Saturday morning . Some of them are from Senators and Representatives and Governors of States , but the vast majority are from private citizens , many of whose names are not familiar to the ' White House . Most of the Senators and Representatives , it was said today , expressed their complete confidence that the President would act in this crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and this , sentiment is coupled in a majority of instances with an expression of the belief that the situation does not require a resort to hostilities . Some of the telegrams condemned the ' utterances of Colonel Roosevelt ! concerning the torpedoing of the Lusitania . Many of those who thought it necessary to communicate their ' views to the President urged him to ? take a firm stand , but did not indicate what that stand should be . These telegrams come from every section of the country . An interesting feature of them is that practically all go beyond the ten-word limit of the minimum rate for telegrams . One of the messages received by the President was a lone telegram from Victor E. Mitchell , K. C. , of Montreal , which was printed in THE NEW Yonic TIMES today . ? Mr. Mitchell appealed to the President to hand passports to Count von Bernstorff , the German Ambassador , and declared that the publication of the German Embassy 's advertisement , warning Americans not to take passage on ships of Germany 's enemies , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Mitchell 's views could be ? obtained at the White House today . In fact , throughout of- ; tidal circles there was a disposition to refrain from-discussion of the possible course of the Government .

The Lusitania case was discussed . When Mr. Bryan was asked late this afternoon whether the expression of regret Came from the German Government or was merely the personal expression of the German Ambassador . He said he understood that it was personal with Count von Bernstorff. it had been explained earlier in the day by Count von Bernstorff , however , that in making the expression of regret he had acted under instructions from the Government at Berlin . " I understood that it was merely his personal sentiment , " was Mr. Bryan 's explanation . Mr. Bryan was told by newspapermen this afternoon that a press dispatch ad come from . Berlin saying that the German Government had telegraphed a message of regret to the United States , but Mr. Bryan said that he had seen no such message . nor bad he received any statement on the subject from Mr. Gerard . the American Ambassador in Berlin . Questioned as to whether his recent circular giving notice that American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for pleasure aria sightseeing , Mr. Bryan said that this was not intended as a warning to Americans not to go abroad . To another inquiry he said that as far as he knew , nobody had written to the State Department asking if it would be unsafe for American travelers to take passage on British ships . No ' Warning , Says Bryan . Mr. Bryan also said that no advice along the line of such an inquiry had been given by the department . As to the advertisement of the German Embassy in American newspapers warning Americans not to take passage on the ships of Germany 's enemies which appeared first on . the day the Lusitania sailed and was repeated last Saturday , Mr. Bryan said that the attention of the State DeArtirtent had not been called to the advertisement in any official way . When he was asked if Germany had given any warning to the United States Government that it was intended to destroy the Lusitania , Mr. Bryan answered in the negative , and then added : " I had better not go further than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Silence Dernburg . Secretary Bryan said the State Depertinent would not take any notice of the statement made by Dr. Bernard Deritibui* it-i " Va " otrle yaqrclay to the effect that the ' German submarine attaeke British ' merchant vessels would *be ' contintfed , ' Mr. Bryan said that Dr. Dernbutg bad litl*Official Stae tus as far as " this ' Government was . aware . Dr. Dernburg 's defense of the sinking of the Lutitatila has ' aroused indignation here , ' and there is reason to believe that this Indignation is shared by Government officials and may have its effect on the course of the diplomatic , action to be taken in the Lusitania case . It would cause no surprise in Washington if Dr. Dernburg 's activities as an agitator were cut short by orders from Berlin . Without any reliable official basis for it , discussion is going on here as to what will be the probable course of President ' Wilson to meet the Lusitania incident . One suggestion is that the Government may break off diplomatic relations with Germany in order to emphasize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on friendly terms with a na1 tion that resorts to inhuman and heebasic methods of warfare . It is pointed out that this course would mean that the United States Government would surrender its responsibility for caring for the interests of German subjects in Great Britain , France , and Russia , but at the same time would be obliged to abandon its care of British , French , and Russian interests in Germany and Austria . While this theory is discussed gravely , the more general opinion appears to be that it will not meet the situation . Must Have Assurances . Those who believe that the matter of upholding the national prestige throughout the civilized world is certain to be the keystone of the President 's action are convinced that no policy will satisfy American sentiment that at least does not contemplate obtaining positive assurances from Germany that there will be no repetition of the Lusitania horror . Opinion in Washington is crystallizing around the suggestion that assurances that Amer. ican lives will ? be safeguarded from German attack on the high seas must be furnished by Germany . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of military measures in the initial effort to obtain a satisfactory solution of the Lusitania incident , persons here have advanced the suggestion that the President 's action will take the form of a personal letter to Emperor William expressing the widespread feeling of horror in the United States over the manner in which Germany is conducting the war . References to the indignation created in America by the destructive work of the German forces in Belgium , it was said , might even be mentioned to emphasize how American public opinion had become more and more aroused until it reached the highest point of horrified expression over the sacrifice of the lives of Americans on the Lusitania . The President . it is asserted , might ask the Emperor to give assurances in behalf of himself and his Government that there would be no repetition of the Lusitania , tragedy , and trust to the Emperor to respond affirmatively . The disposition here among those who have some understanding of President Wilson 's character is to believe that he will not be hindered by technicalities in dealing with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she was subsidized by the British Government and could be taken over as an auxiliary cruiser , will not influence the President , it is believed , in determining how the situation shall be dealt with . It is not doubted there that the President will act soon , and there is expectation that he will be prepared to show his hand when the Cabinet holds its regular meeting tomorrow . Other Envoys See Bryan . The British and French Ambassadors were at the State Department late in the day to express to Mr. Bryan their sympathy over the Lusitania tragedy . Both showed deep interest in the development of public feeling over the catastrophe , but it was apparent that they had nothing to suggest as to what should be the action of the United States . That America must Settle . herself directly with Germany for these acts was the substance *of opinion among the diplomatic representatives-of the allied powers . Chevalier van Rappard , Minister from the Netherlands , also called at the department , and made it clear that that the situation of his Government was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Lusitania . After a conference with Counselor Lansing , Mr. van Rappard said that citizens of Holland had lost their lives on the Lusitania that Dutch ships had been torpedoed as was the American steamer Gulflight , and that Dutch commerce had suffered more severely than that of the United States .
