NEVER has jewelry been more beautiful , nor in more demand than at the present day , " says an American authority on precious stones . Following the Renaissance , when jewelry was distinguished by remarkable delicacy of technique and beauty of design , came a reaction in favor of the machine-made objects . As the knowledge of the possibilities and marvels of machinery grew , the demand for its product increased . Hand-wrought jewelry was regarded as a laborious creation of an earlier age , before man had conquered steam and electricity . Only in. out-of-the-way spots , where progress had not penetrated , was the art of the jewelry craftsman retained . It is this that is known today as " peasant jewelry . " Despite the fact that time and money was saved on the jewelry turned out by thousands from machines , there was a sameness of design which palled on lovers of the beautiful . All the charm of originality , the fineness of design , and , in fact , the very spirit of the art , was lacking in many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauty of the hand-wrought articles , as shown by the workers willing to spend the time and study necessary to perfect their art , brought about the presentday revival . This revival has revealed to us the originality of design of the antique jewel workers , the ingenuity and skill of the medieval craftsman , and the exquisite  |p587  loveliness and refinement of the Renaissance goldsmiths . Art now dominates the making of jewelry . In every direction in the realm of jewelry this revival is displayed . The delicacy , the minuteness , , of the workmanship of the Venetian goldsmiths and their followers has been equaled , and even surpassed , today by the skilled artisans who can cut a stone into a perfect particle of not more than a forty-five thousandth of a gram , or reduce the thickness of a watch to that of cardboard . It is demonstrated again in the wider choice of stones . A few years ago a woman who desired a piece of jewelry selected one of the five precious stones , ? a diamond , pearl , ruby , sapphire or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stones in her collection . Nor does she feel it necessary to select the largest stone that she can secure for the money . Through the knowledge generated by this revival she appreciates the fact that a stone is beautiful because of its color and its position in the decorative scheme , not because of its size , nor its cost . This fact furnishes one of the motifs of the presentday revival . The beauty of enamel and its adaptation to jewelry is another important feature of the revival . It is to Rene Lalique , of Paris , that much of the interest in this branch of jewelry must be attributed . He is the acknowledged master . His fertile imagination , infinite resource of design and his dexterity have enabled him to create the most beautiful examples of enamel jewelry . A stone or a particularly rich piece of enamel immediately suggests to his artist 's brain a flower , a winged insect , or even the human figure . And ' with this as a motif he evolves a masterpiece . Women in Paris build a gown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subtle shadings and rich harmonies furnish the color scheme for a  |p588  sartorial creation of unparalleled loveliness . There are many artists who are striving with more or . less success to emulate the art of this master of enamel . Of the few who have been successful there is Rene Foy , whose work is reproduced herewith , and Gaston LaFitte . A larger proportion , in endeavoring to create something individual and original , have only succeeded in producing the grotesque . The . practicality is sometimes sacrificed to beauty by this school of Art Nouveau workers . A piece of jewelry to be truly successful must be practical as well as artistic . It can not be so delicate that it will not wear well , or the very idea of jewelry is lost ; it is primarily intended to be worn . Even in primitive times it was used first as the answer to the instinct for beautifying the person and making it more desirable . Later , it became useful as well . The brooch , for instance , originated from a thorn which was used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the fastening more secure it was bent , very much as the safety-pin of today is constructed . Utility , however , is a secondary consideration , just as is the desire to own pieces of jewelry because they are exquisite bits of art , or objects of beauty . The demand today may be traced to the same primitive instinct for personal adornment that surged in the breasts of our ancestors thousands of years ago . To this longing may be added the desire of arousing the envy of less favored mortals , and the attempt to establish a certain social status . Just as the modes in costumes change , so do the styles in jewelry , but with less frequency , and in a less radical manner . The piece of jewelry purchased last season is still attractive , if it was an artistic creation in the beginning . There are no autocrats who issue spring and fall decrees that women shall wear certain styles of  |p589  jewelry . Each shop has its own special designs , and a certain number are purchased from time to time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sartorial . The changes in costume are studied by the de- , signers of jewelry , and have more or less influence on their work . Certain robes de style , as costumes of past periods in history are designated , bring back into popular fancy the jewelry worn at those times . When the Eastern influence is dominant in clothes , there is a corresponding increase in the demand for jewelry , displaying the same brilliant coloring and the same bold , somewhat barbaric design . The vogue of certain colors will likewise create a demand for , stones of the same hue , or harmonizing ones . It is said that emeralds and rubies will be fashionable this season because these vivid , brilliant tones are expected in costumes . The desire to add a certain dash of color to a gown is largely responsible for the constantly increasing demand for semi-precious stones . The idea of continuing the color scheme with the jewels is another link connecting the styles in dress with those in jewelry . Certain styles , on the other hand , are originated entirely outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Duke of Connaught presented his wife with a ring containing a cat's-eye , and forthwith cat's-eyes became popular . Queen Victoria 's love of opals created an interest in these curiously tinted stones , so full of fire and mystery . Scarcity has made pearls the most expensive of jewels , and helped , no doubt , to make them the most fashionable . Beautiful laces , rich brocades and velvets , soft satins , and diaphanous veilings , the very acme of luxury , have their counterpart in the exquisitely delicate and fine jewelry created for the coming season . The diamond jewelry is a veritable lacework of myriads of tiny stones ,  - -  a dazzling frost of  |p590  diamonds . Into this background , demanding the finest and best of workmanship , the stone is introduced as the motif . Platinum is used almost exclusively for the setting because it brings out the brilliancy of the stones to better advantage . The plaques and medallions have been superseded by the drop pendants . The flat enamel watches with-a tracery of diamonds will share the favor shown the pendants . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the button earrings , which are quite passe . The very newest idea in designs for earrings calls for a fringe of . tiny stones . Here again , there is the parallel with the fashion world , where fringe reigns supreme . The vogue for small stones is seen , also , in the new rings , in which the center stone is closely surrounded with . one or two rows of small diamonds , or encased in a design carried out in the tiny particles of diamonds , as perfectly cut as he larger stones . A certain number of novelties is introduced each season . This season 's fancies include the anklet and the armlet . The latter is of two types ; either a broad band of gold , shimmering through the lace of the sleeve , or a band of gold , worn on the outside of the sleeve , studded with jewels or elaborately hammered . One of the most unique ideas is shown in the Rajah ring . In India , where the dusky maidens dance with their feet instead of with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their Western sisters do their fingers . To get a ring which will cling to the little toe of a nimble-footed ( lancer it is necessary to have the stone portion extend backward , upon the foot . The same idea has been carried out in a little finger or dinner-ring . The stone , with the setting , is shown to excellent advantage on the hand , but it is not a comfortable ring to wear under a glove . This desire for novelties is expressed in a more interesting manner in the individual  |p591  jewelry , as it may be described . This is the jewelry created for a certain person , the stone or the design carrying out a sentiment or thought which is particularly appealing . Sometimes the entire design is worked out by the person ; again , the idea is merely suggested and it is left to the skill of the craftsman to interpret it in the most artistic manner . Jewelry of this type has naturally more value than that for mere personal adornment ; it is different , unique , and possesses the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A clever idea took form in a necklace presented to a mother by her nine daughters . On the cameo , forming the pendant , the portrait of the mother was carved , and on the nine stones , composing the necklace , were the portraits of the daughters . A similar thought was carried out in a brooch , in which were artistically combined the birthstones of the woman 's children and that of her husband . On each of them was carved the appropriate portrait . There was special difficulty in this instance , as one or two of the stones were almost too soft to carve , while others were so hard that they chipped easily . The natal stone in combination with diamonds is often seen in engagement rings , where something more individual is desired than the solitaire diamond decreed by tradition . There are numerous lists of these birth stones , which vary slightly . The idea of associating a special gem with each month was probably suggested by the original breastplate of the high priest of the Jews , which contained twelve gems , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zodiacal sign and the flower of the month are often ingeniously wrought into the settings containing the stone of the birth-month . It is difficult to give a general rule for the wearing of jewelry , other than that dictated by good taste . It is the worst possible form to load oneself with jewelry at any  |p592  time , and particularly in the morning . When one is in the informal costume of the street , ? shirtwaist and skirt , trotteur dress or suit , the so-called tailored jewelry is appropriate . In this class is included the hand-wrought gold jewelry , with semiprecious stones . Much of the arts and crafts jewelry can be worn on informal occasions , as the semi-precious stones are generally employed by these handcraftsmen , and very often the silver settings . The peasant jewelry of Europe is likewise appropriate for mourning wear . The best known French peasant jewelry comes from Normandy and Auvergne . Norway and Sweden have exquisite jewelry in silver filigree , and there are quantities of this humbler product in Germany and Italy . fhe Adriatic jewelry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly desirable . . Those who follow the rules strictly wear only the little finger rings before the noon hour , the simplest form of earrings , and , if a pendant is desired , a small , dainty creation or the watch hanging from a plain ; fine gold or platinum chain . When bracelets are demanded , those simply hammered from gold , or set with semi-precious stones , are permissible . With the more formal afternoon costume the precious stones are worn , although not in the profusion displayed in the evening . The opera and balls call forth the choicest treasures of the jewel box . The carefully gowned woman , however , never makes a caricature df herself with her jewels . She does not think it is necessary to deck herself out like the show case in a jeweler 's shop to prove that she possesses a large number of handsome gems . She chooses the jewelry that will harmonize with the color of her gown , or that expresses a thought she subtly wished to convey . It is the ensemble , the complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p593  combine stones of various hues , or precious gems with semi-precious stones . If she wishes to add to her height she wears a long chain , or adjusts in her hair a tall tiara . Even the coloring of the skin is thoughtfully considered in the choice of jewels . There is art in selecting the proper jewelry for the occasion , and in wearing it to the best advantage . The tremendous demand for gems during recent years has resulted in various processes ' for the manufacture of stones . Professor Tecla of Paris has been the most successful with his processes for making , artificially , pearls , rubies , sapphires and emeralds . The particles of the real ruby are crushed to a powder , and fed by electric tappings , at regular intervals , into an apparatus called a chalumeau , which is an ingenious adaptation of the oxy-hydrogen , blow-pipe . Sapphires are made from sapphire dust built from the chemical constituents of the natural stone by the same process . The formula for making emeralds is a more complicated one . All these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gems , and only an expert could distinguish them . The price is only about one-hundreth that of the natural stone . The Tecla pearl has as its core a piece of mother-of-pearl , which is clipped into a secret solution for several hours each day . Each immersion adds a thin layer of pearl , even as the natural pearl grows by acquiring layers . The process is an imitation of Nature , and the result brings forth a stone with the same hardness , the same wondrously beautiful opalescent tints , and the same creamy luster of the pearl . All of these reconstructed stones are combined with genuine diamonds in creating the various pieces of jewelry , and the same care and thought are given to the designing . This present-day revival has had another interesting development in the arts and  |p595  crafts jewelry . The demand for the careful and skilled workmanship of the craftsmen of past centuries and artistic designs wherein the stone was given an appropriate position in a well-thought art scheme , has brought into existence a class of workers who create for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . There are various schools where the students are taught the necessary rudiments . For some it is a commercial undertaking , and they fit themselves to create articles worthy to compete in the world of trade ; others work for art 's sake alone , or for personal pleasure . Originally these hand craftsmen worked largely in silver , as an easier and less expensive medium , in case of failure . Today , the most notable work is being done in gold by workers who have become so efficient that they are fashioning jewelry that is technically as good as can be done , having the additional charm of good design and real artistic feeling . This individual charm and character , which makes the arts and crafts jewelry so appealing , is necessarily lacking in articles turned out in large quantities in factories by people working almost entirely on piece work and doing only a small fraction of the whole article . The lack of this great essential is the primary difference between the handicraft jewelry and that made by machinery . The general revival in jewelry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appreciated jewelry dominated by art has taken precedence over all others .  |p595
