txt // of the people ; and its gradually forming doctrines assumed shapes not unfamiliar in many of their aspects . The concep-tion , for example , of an incarnated God , dying and rising again , whose body and blood were tasted by the devout be-lievers , resembled closely various prevalent and popular beliefs . During the centuries wherein Christian belief was still fluid and developing simultaneously in many different directions , those variations that were most in line with the antecedent beliefs of the people naturally attracted their sympathy and tended to win the day . Moreover , Jesus was a Jew ; the Greek- and Latin-speaking peoples might trans-late and repeat his words , but to them they inevitably had different meanings and lent themselves to another set of ideas . Habits of thought and religious practices are not easily transformed ; and if the pagan world was Christian-ized , so also was Christianity paganized . It may be doubted , indeed , whether " orthodox " Christianity is not more Greek than Hebraic in spirit and form ; certainly on its theoretical side it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in accepting moulded after its own ways of thinking , the still Jewish beliefs of the apostles . ' // This process of absorption and universalization could not , to be sure , go on too rapidly without evoking violent revivals of the purer Christian spirit . Montanism ? the name given to a conservative reaction breaking out in the middle of the second century ? fought the growing Hellenic tendencies in the Church and sought to turn it back to its more primi-tive and Jewish forms , particularly cultivating the " gifts of the spirit " and the naive belief in the imminent return of Christ to earth . And if it failed to check the inevitable drift , on the other hand the Hellenization of Christianity failed to eliminate all the naive and legendary elements of the religion and mould it into a completely rationalized system . The prevailing tendency was that which retained much of the Hebraic background and spirit ? a via media between the opposing forces . ' The fluidity and individualism of early Christianity received its first decisive check at the Council of Nictea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the domination of the just-con-verted Emperor Constantine , the first authoritative Chris- // tian creed . Up to the promulgation of this Nicene creed each church had had its own baptismal formulas ; and such creeds as had been formulated were neither long nor of general acceptance . Constantine was probably not deeply reli-gious by temperament , but he was a good administrator ; having decided to make Christianity the state religion , he wished its doctrine more exactly determined . ' And there seemed an immediate necessity for some exercise of author-ity , in view of the violent disputes current on all sorts of major and minor points of doctrine . It was only after long and bitter controversy that the decision swung as it did . And although later creeds show considerable change of con-viction , it is difficult to overestimate the effect upon the sub-sequent course of Christian thought of the conceptions which through the prestige of this imperial church council were now imposed upon the Church ? 2 The Athanasian Creed , so called , is considerably later than the Nicene , dating probably from the sixth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stamp of the particu-lar controversies which were then raging . In an age when the centrifugal forces within the Church were great , and the attacks upon it from without multitudinous and acute , it was a perhaps justifiable instinct of self-preservation that led it to this hard and fast definition of its position . But the result was an arrested development , the formation of a // crust of dogma ; representing the conceptions of that intel-lectually keen and subtle but egregiously unscientific age , which has nearly choked the modern church and is still costing heavy effort to burst . Two historic movements , then , united in Christianity . O the one hand , the deep religious fervor of the Jews , freed by Christ from what was local and unessential , and translated by Paul into terms intelligible to the outer world ; on the other , the great intellectual movement of Greece , the meta-physical conceptions that had been developing from Plato and Aristotle into Neo-Platonism and Stoicism . The He-braic element brought undeniably much that persisted and leavened society . Yet when men trained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the new faith , ? which the Church insisted should be accepted first and understood , if possible , afterwards , ? they wan-dered far from the original gospel . The transition from the then current Greek speculation to Christian theology ? as from pagan to Catholic ritual ? was hardly as violent as the change from the faith and teaching of Christ to the body of doctrine that grew up about his name . For one thing , the symbolism so common in the Jewish writings was a stumbling-block to the pagan mind ; and many a metaphor and trope was taken literally and crystal-lized into doctrine : as , for example , when the words of Christ to his disciples calling the wine and bread , by a natural and pathetic figure , his blood and body , became hardened into the extraordinary dogma of transubstantiation . ' In such manner did the Aryan speculative temper make strange work of the Hebraic parables and intuitions ! All sorts of in-genious subterfuges sought to reconcile the resultant incon-sistencies , and many conflicting theologies competed with one another for dominance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the majority vote ruled , and all other doctrines than those accepted were dubbed heresy . So grew up the body of Christian theology , widely different , in its ultimate form , from the Christianity of Paul , and still further , of course , from the religion of Jesus . Yet the Christianization of the Gra ? co-Roman world wrought a great change . Speculative tendencies continued with little change of direction , popular conceptions and observances were absorbed ; but underneath all this the spiritual earnestness and purity and love of Jesus and his followers were finding their way into the world . A new ideal of life was set before the mind , far vistas of sympathy and mercy and self-surrender replaced the pagan ideal of self-assertion ; and through all the mutations of theology the Christian life still glowed in the hearts of men and beckoned them onward . What was the origin of the conceptions of I. The Atonement ? Among the conceptions slowly crystallized by the impingement of Greek thought upon the primitive Christian experiences and hopes was that of the Atonement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a mystic union with Christ had been the fundamental note of Paul 's teaching . As Adam had plunged the whole human race into sin , so Christ had rescued them ; he was the Second Adam , the Saviour of men . Thus could Jewish Messianism be interpreted in terms not dissimilar to those of the Greek mysteries . As with Attis , Adonis , and Osiris , this Saviour-God had suffered , died , and risen again ; and his worshipers were to repeat in their lives , in inward experience , this death and resurrection . The study of these contemporary cults shows the Pauline conception to have been one of several analogous // salvation-schemes.1 With Paul it was an experience rather than a theory ; that he had actually entered upon the New Life through the giving of his allegiance to Christ , he knew . Moreover , that Christ , having died , yet lived , and had re-vealed himself to Paul on that eventful day , was unquestion-able to him . That his death had somehow been for men 's sins was not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the almost necessary explanation of such a strange and otherwise incomprehensible event . Death was the penalty of sin ; but since Christ had been sinless , his suf-fering must have been vicarious , like that of the " Suffering Servant of Jehovah " prefigured in Isaiah 53 ? a passage which Christ had no doubt applied to himself . ' Somehow Christ had conquered sin and death , for himself and for all who clave to him . But in Paul the conception remained fluid , rhetorical , growing . The way stood open for bitter controversy over the question what the convert must do . Was it enough to believe , was salvation " by faith alone , " did the mystical union with Christ suffice , in a magical sort of way ? Or was continuance in " good works " essential to sal-vation ? 3 And the way stood open for endless theorizing over the question how faith in Christ could redeem men . The // answers to this latter question constitute the various doc-trines of the Atonement . ' II . The Trinity ? The prevalent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , remote from men , ineffable , unknowable . Nor did the teaching concerning the war-god of the Old Testament , with his Jewish affiliations , and his role as Judge of men , in great degree break down that sense of aloofness . But Christ ? that beloved personage , that Redeemer of men , who had suffered and died for them ? appealed deeply to their hearts . Christ had been the great fact to Paul and the first Christians , union by faith with him their primary Aigious experience . The conception of him as Jewish Mes-siah was , indeed , unintelligible and uninteresting to the Greeks and Latins . But even to the believing Jews he had been a heaven-sent , more or less supernatural Being . A mass of legend and miracle had grown up around him ; he had become a figure not unlike many with which the Greeks were familiar , gods who had walked the earth and shared human experiences . And so nothing could have been more natural and inevitable than the popular deification of Christ . Even Paul had spoken of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or again , simply the Spirit , indistinguishably . his mind was too practical to care for consistency or to spin out a satisfactory theory of it all . But the result of his preaching was that Christ assumed a far more exalted position to the Gentile world than he could have had to the Jews . Pliny 's " carmen Christo quasi deo dicere " indicates the popular worship of Christ ; and in the early creeds propositions about him far out-bulk those about God . It would have been consonant with the polytheistic // habits of thought of the Western peoples to have left Christ simply as another God by the side of Jehovah . But this was deeply repugnant to the ingrained monotheism of the Jews . And as the Jewish Scriptures had been taken over by the new religion , it became necessary to reconcile their emphatic monotheism with the deification of Christ . Fortunately there was a conception familiar to the contemporary Greek mind of just the sort to solve this paradox ? namely , the Logos conception . Philo , a Jewish philosopher of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in expounding to the Greek world a Hellenized Judaism , which he had hoped to make the absolute religion of the future . He had taken up the term Logos , which meant to the Neo-Platon-ists the Word , or Emanation , or Creative Activity , of God ? a sort of separate entity which bridged the chasm between God and man ; he had applied this conception to Jehovah , and had been materially aided by the fact that the Greek translators of the Old Testament had made frequent use of this same term , Logos , in the phrases which we translate " word " of God . Even in the Old Testament this " word " or " wisdom " or " creative activity " of God had seemed at times half-personified , as if a separate Being . From Philo or some other of the many writers who were using the term Logos the mystical author of the Fourth Gospel derived the word and most of its significance ; his contribution was that he identified Christ with this Logos of God , and made it therefore clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although con-troversy long raged as to the exact relation between Christ and the Father . Thus the dominant tendency of Greek thought triumphed , and the popular worship of Christ was satisfied . From the conception of a man divinely anointed by God for the carrying out of his purpose for his chosen peo- // plc , to that of a supernatural Being sent by God to save men , thence to that of an Emanation of God himself , and finally to a flat identification with God as one of the " persons " of the One Godhead was a development that occupied several centuries . But in the end the instincts and concepts of the Western peoples triumphed over the Jewish monotheism ? which must have seemed cold and bare to them at best ; and Christ , like Buddha , and many another religious founder be-fore him , became very God . ' The Neo-Platonic conception thus partially adopted was , in some of its forms , trinitarian ; 2 and it may be a significant fact that it was by Greek-trained thinkers that the dogma of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half-personified in the Old Testament ; but it was now dis-possessed of the right to be thought of as the Logos of God by Christians . This Holy Spirit , however , had been of strik-ing importance in early Christianity ? the " manifestations of the Spirit " being the undeniable proofs of redemption . ' It was obviously detachable , so to speak , from God , could " descend upon men " and enter their hearts . According to the Fourth Gospel , Christ had promised his disciples to send this Spirit to live in their hearts when he should no longer be with them . Gradually this Holy Spirit became more and more a separate Being , until by the Christian thinkers of the second and third centuries it was made into the Third Per-son of a new and Christian Trinity . The deep and perma-nent truth enshrined in this dogma we shall speak of in chap-ter Ix ; but in the literal form which it assumed , e.g. , in the Nicene creed , we must recognize an embodiment of con-temporary Greek speculation of a sort very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maturer out-look.1 Christianity , indeed , went still further in its concessions to the polytheistic temper of the people . The saints , and especially the mother of Christ , were also worshiped . In 431 A.D. the Council of Ephesus decreed that the latter be received and honored ? as a sort of supplement to the Trinity ? under the title of the Mother of God . III . Heaven , Hell , and Purgatory ? The beliefs of the Hebrews as to what lay beyond the grave were , like those of most ancient peoples , vague , fluc-tuating , and insecure.2 The future life , if there was to be one at all , was to be rather dreaded than desired . It was not at all from these forebodings , but from the very different and far more eager anticipation of an earthly Messianic kingdom , that the Christian hope was developed . Jesus and Paul and the earliest Christians had expected the coming of the Messianic Kingdom within a few years.3 As time went on , however , and Jesus did not appear , in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Two tend-encies then developed.4 In the first place , the Judgment Day and inauguration of the Kingdom were put farther and // farther away ; 1 and all those sayings that described this im-pending event as an obviously outward and earthly affair 2 were referred to that remoter future . On the other hand , the sayings that promised a speedy return had to be taken meta-phorically , as meaning a coming in spirit in the hearts of the believers ? an interpretation consonant , perhaps , with the early post-crucifixion experiences of the disciples . ' Further , the Kingdom of God ? or Kingdom of Heaven , as it was sometimes called ( owing to a reticence in speaking the Di-vine name ) ? which to the Jews had always meant a heav-enly kingdom on earth , in Judma , was interpreted by the Greeks , naturally out of sympathy with such local hopes , to mean a kingdom in the heavens . The vague " outer dark-ness " into which the wicked were to be cast crystallized gradually into a definite region of future torment , usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existence , as a vast pit under the earth . ' Thus arose the Christian doctrine of Heaven and Hell , The Day of Judgment at the end of the existing order ? that nightmare of the Middle Ages ? was gradually put far-ther and farther into the future ; though at several epochs a feverish anticipation of its imminent approach became wide-spread . At that great dies irte the dead were to rise from the grave and assemble at the throne of God , where the sheep would be separated from the goats , the former to be rewarded with eternal happiness , the latter punished with eternal tor-ment . The Devil , introduced into late Judaism , probably from Persia , ' apparently believed in but little emphasized EARLY CHRISTIANITY Ill by Jesus , assumed importance in this scheme ; though his relation to the God , who , although omnipotent , tolerated him , was a matter for much controversy . When the alterna-tive between everlasting bliss or torment seemed too sharp , the doctrine of Purgatory , long familiar in the Orphic mysteries , crept in to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Scripture , it was rejected by Protestantism . ' In such ways the various dogmas of the growing Church came into being . Council after council , in stormy debate , worked out what was to be for centuries the orthodox Chris-tian belief . Much ingenuity and many acute disputations went to the forming of this body of doctrine , the mental energy and ability of the times finding in this way its outlet . In the subtle and elaborate work of Thomas Aquinas the system reached its completest form . The authority of the Church enforced its acceptance and thus fossilized it , ensur-ing it against healthy criticism or further development . In Dante 's Divine Comedy , wherein deep religious feeling and the highest poetic genius vivified and illumined this gigantic framework of dogma , we have the greatest and most lasting product of Catholic theology . Opposing doctrines were vig-orously stamped out ; and this strange composite of popular faith and learned dialectic imposed itself with a grip of iron upon the mind of the Western world . CHAPTER VIII LATER CHRISTIANITY ; MOHAMMEDANISM By what process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called on his people to repent and be ready for the approaching world-change . And the earliest Palestinian Christians simply gathered informally to listen to the happy story , renew their faith in their Messiah , and strengthen one another in well-doing . It was rather with Paul 's little groups of converts in Asia Minor and Greece , as time wore on , that church organization developed . At first they were very democratic , vesting whatever disciplinary and executive powers were necessary in their elders ; 2 even into the sec-ond century , in Polycarp 's time , their organization had proceeded scarcely farther . But for mutual helpfulness it became advisable to elect overseers ? episcopoi , bishops ; these were at first simply the most prominent elders . Grad-nally these bishops assumed greater and greater authority , until the government of the churches was rather monarchical than democratic . St. Jerome , indeed , warns the bishops 3 to " remember that if they are set over the presbyters , it is the result of tradition , and not a particular institution of the // Lord . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the functions  --  and even the titles , sacerdos , pontifex , etc. ? of their predecessors , the pagan priests ; and so , step by step , the pagan sacerdotal idea replaced the simpler conception of primitive Christianity . Amid these bishops it was natural that the Bishop of Rome should have the greatest prestige . Rome was the cap-ital of the Empire , and ? especially now that Jerusalem had fallen ? the natural center for the Church 's life . More-over , in the struggle against unbelievers and heretics it be-came necessary to have some central authority . Church councils were too clumsy a method of solving this problem ; the leadership of the Roman bishops offered a promise of unity . Thus the Papacy was practically a fait accompli be-fore it occurred to its apologists to justify it by the theory of divine right through Petrine succession . ' That theory , as it was formulated toward the close of the second century , derived the powers of the Doman bishop , by an unbroken succession , from the apostle Peter , who was said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom Jesus was said to have conferred authority over the Church.2 There was // strenuous opposition from the other bishops and their churches to this assumption of authority by Rome . But the early Roman bishops were good politicians ; and out of the general chaos they emerged triumphant . Thus , by an easily intelligible process , a powerful centralized Church , modeled in organization after the Roman Empire , and succeeding to its authority and prestige , grew up out of the democratic fraternities of primitive disciples . During the same period a ritual and liturgy were evolved , and the Church more and more assumed control over the lives of men . The weaker the Empire grew , the stronger grew the power of priesthood and papacy . The division of the Empire led , indeed , to a like growth in authority of the Bishop of Constantinople ; and a schism between East and Nest developed which was never healed . But though the Eastern Church remained , and remains to this day , separate from the Roman Church , the latter waxed steadily in au-thority in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emperor Valentinian ; and a few years later another emperor , Theodosius , humbled himself and performed penance at the dictation of that bishop of the Church . In 800 , Leo III placed the crown on the head of the Emperor of the franks ; and at the beginning of the thirteenth century Innocent III dominated Europe . Finally , in the nineteenth century , the dogma of the infallibility of the Pope was decreed ? a des-perate attempt to stem the rising tide of secularism which has shorn from the Papacy its political power and a large , part of its hold on the minds of men . What was the significance of the Reformation ? During the Middle Ages the decree of Pope and Council was accepted by all the Western peoples that had adopted Christianity . Not , indeed , without recurrent chafing and protest ; there were many " reformers before the Reformats // tion . " But the masses were illiterate and ignorant , intercommunication of thought was not easy , and the various early attempts at rebellion proved abortive . So , although the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bohemia , and other independent and deeply religious spirits , the actual break with Rome did not occur until Luther 's defiance of Papal authority in 1517 . Luther , who was a priest , and a professor in the University of Wittenberg , did not foresee at first an actual secession from the Church ; but circumstances drove him on . Excommunicated in 159,0 , he publicly burned the Papal decree . Others flocked to his standard ; in 1529 a number of German princes and representatives of the cities signed the famous Protest which gave the name to the new movement . Political considerations entered in ; especially the new sense of nationality among the Northern peoples welcomed the opportunity to get rid of the Roman yoke . In Switzerland , Denmark , Sweden , and the British Isles the challenge to Papal authority was particularly welcome . After protracted discussion and struggle , issuing in actual warfare in central Europe , the Northern nations became predominantly Protestant , while in the Mediterranean countries the old regime retained its hold . The Reformation was really a revolution ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by which the Roman Church purged itself , under the stress of criticism and revolt , of its more flagrant abuses . The most palpable of these , and the immediate occasion of Luther 's protest , was the shocking and cynical sale of indulgences , whereby those who had money were granted forgiveness of sins and eternal life . But this was only one embodiment of the corruption and wire-pulling in the Church of the times , corruption that was so snugly intrenched in high places as to need drastic measures . The protest of the reformers was directed , however , not only against the worldliness // and politics in the Church , but against the paganized form of the Gospel which had become the official doctrine ? the worship of the Madonna , of saints and relics , the dogma of transsubstantiation and the sacrifice of the Mass , the belief it Purgatory and the practice of prayers for the dead , the insti tution of Confession ? such accretions of doctrine , which seemed to the reformers rather heathen than Christian . There was also an element @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and flourishing side by side with its worldliness ? the monastic system , the celibate clergy , the fastings and penances whereby special merit with God was to be won . Some of the practices thus criticized were presently reformed within the ancient Church . But the Protestant revolt was too fundamental to be checked by such concessions . With the revival of Greek culture and learning , the renaissance of the study of nature , and the awakening of the spirit of free inquiry , the control of a self-styled authoritative church over the minds of men was doomed . These humanizing and enlightening influences had been instinctively antagonized by the Church and long repressed . But the new ideas spread from the universities , and the authority of established beliefs could not remain unchallenged . The revolt from Dome did not imply an immediate and far-reaching change of beliefs ; but it did mean a freedom from the choking ecclesiastical tyranny which was rendering freedom of thought and further growth impossible . It meant that henceforth the people were to have a hand in the government and creedal decisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sacerdotal system , with all its external machinery of salvation . Religion again , as in the hands of Christ and of Paul , became a first-hand and inward matter ; salvation was not through sacraments and priestly absolution , but through the immediate relation of the individual to Christ and God . 11.8 HISTORICAL Thus the independent and virile Northern races broke away from the domination of a stifling ecclesiastical system which had become , as time went on , in greater and greater degree alien to their temper . The underlying and unexpressed ideal of the Deformation was that beliefs and practices must not be imposed upon men 's minds by an external authority , but must grow out of experience and be tested by reason . But it is only gradually that Protestantism has come to full self-consciousness . The craving for outward and visible authority to lean upon long persisted ; and a great deal of the Catholic absolutist spirit survived in the new churches . Moreover , in the struggle against Dome the need of some weapon was felt ; the weapon at hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a church only to fall into slavery to Scripturetexts . And many Protestants , advancing beyond their contemporaries in liberal thought , were persecuted not only by Catholics , but by their own more conservative brethren . The history of Protestantism is a record of intolerance and bigotry which goes far to dim its actual achievement in setting men on the path of progress . Yet that it did set men on the path of progress is undeniable . Although when it broke with ecclesiastical authority it took refuge in the authority of Scripture , making that the basis and oracle of its faith , there was this momentous gain : instead of having to go to the priests to learn the truth , every one could henceforth find it for himself in God 's written word . But the Bible , being a heterogeneous collection of writings expressing the points of view of many writers of widely separated times and beliefs , easily supplies a text for almost any doctrine ? especially if its words are wrenched from their context and interpreted in the violent and arbitrary manner common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its parent-faith , claiming the support of an // infallible authority , lent itself to growth and change ; a rapid divergence of belief resulted . ' What have been the subsequent tendencies of Chris . tianity ? ( 1 ) At first , revolting from the loose and degenerate prac-tices of contemporary Catholicism , Protestantism assumed a form of grim austerity ; in Calvinism we have the severest form of Christianity . Calvin , with uncompromising logic , drew from the harshest verses of the Bible a clean-cut and relentless system , which bred a race of stern morality , but nearly banished all the natural joys of life . In England the new national church ? established largely through political reasons ? was , except for its independence of home , but a slightly expurgated Catholicism ; and the Puritans ? those who stood out for a pure church ? looked upon it as a case of arrested development . They would have no images or candles or luxurious vestments , no mummery of ritual or liturgy , nothing luring to the senses or smacking of worldli-ness . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face with God and Ilis word they lived , a stern , uncompro-mising and splendidly devoted band . New England was first settled , and made what it was to be , by them . Such men as Cotton Mather and Jonathan Edwards were fit to rank , in the power and purity of their lives and the depth of their religious feeling , with the great Hebrew prophets . And yet , Puritanism , with its firth belief in predestination and eternal punishment , was a religion to make one shudder . Such ser-mons as Edwards 's Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God depict a deity beside whom the Devil himself pales into a // mildly malevolent being . An arbitrary and cruel tyrant , damning the majority of his helpless creatures , and saving a remnant , not for their own merits , but to manifest his own power , or " glory , " deserves at the least Channing 's phrase ? " a very injurious view of the Supreme Being . " 1 ( 2 ) And in fact this hideous doctrine became , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awful for men 's increasingly humane instincts . The whole Calvinistic-Puri-tanic scheme , with its grim stress on the eternal gulf between sinners and saved , and its black picture of the natural state of man , however suited to the dark times of St. Augustine and Calvin , was not plausible in the easier and on the whole much purer conditions of modern life ; and it has gradually come to seem nothing less than preposterous to all but the most tenaciously conservative of the descendants of those who , but a generation or two ago , firmly believed it . The conception of God prevalent at any time reflects the temper and ideals of the believers ; and the modern mind , more sen-sitive to suffering than that of earlier ages , will tolerate no such tyrannical and brutal deity.2 Thus there has been in recent times , and particularly in // America , a great revival of belief in the love of God , leading in many quarters to a conviction of universal salvation . Charming declared that the orthodox " have too often felt as if God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of morality , above those eternal laws of equity and rectitude , to which all other beings are subjected ... . We believe that God is infinitely good , kind , and benevolent , in the proper sense of these words ; good not to a few , but to all ; good to every individual . " Theodore Parker wrote , God 's " plan must be adapted to secure the ultimate welfare of each creature he has made . " This gentler and happier view has permeated in greater or less degree all the Protest-ant churches , and bids fair to become the dominant Chris-tian conception . ' ( 3 ) This great reversal of belief , together with many other changes of conception which we have not space to enumer-ate , involved the abandonment of tenets that seemed se-curely based upon the Bible , and naturally shook its author-ity . More and more , reason came to be upheld in its place as the ultimate criterion of truth . St. Augustine had said , " This is my faith because it is the Catholic faith . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the Bible says so . " But many were saying by the eighteenth century , with Toland , " We hold that reason is the only foundation of all certitude , " and with Bishop Butler , " Reason is , indeed , // the only faculty which we have to judge concerning anything , even revelation itself . . . . The faculty of reason is the candle of the Lord within us , against vilifying which we must be very cautious . " In 1819 Channing , a Christian minister , could write , " If religion be the shipwreck of understanding , we can not keep too far from it " ; and a little later , " We must never forget that our rational nature is the greatest gift of God .... If I could not be a Christian without ceasing to be rational , I should not hesitate as to my choice . . . I am surer that my rational nature is from God than that any book is the expression of his will . " In pursuance of this spirit , modern Liberal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study any other book , sees the Hebrew god Jehovah for what he really was to the minds of those early Semites , and recognizes him as being to them very much what the contemporary gods of Greece or Babylon were to their worshipers . Its God must be less barbarous , local , and anthropomorphic , revealed rather in the eternal moral law than in special miracles or Jewish codes . He is no longer thought of as favoring a special people or having the scope of his purposes limited by the history of Judaism and Christianity . The whole world process is his plan ; we are to read his will not so much in the sermons of Isaiah or the letters of Paul as in the conscience with which we are all endowed and the universal spiritual experience of man . ( 4 ) The ultimate goal of Protestantism seems to be the complete rationalization of its beliefs , the acceptance by religion of science as the arbiter of truth , and the formulation of her insights and ideals in terms that science can accept . The promise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belief whose germs were contained in the Reformation . There is even , in the movement known as Modernism , a push within the Catholic Church toward this goal . But // while such endeavors are strictly repressed by the Roman See , Protestantism , rejoicing in its comparative freedom , presents the spectacle of a chaos of experiments in reconciliation of the old and the new . On the one hand there are reactionary eddies toward traditional beliefs ; on the other , all sorts of new and grotesquely irrational cults , tangential to he main line of development . Spiritualism , with its supposititious evidence of a future life , offers comfort to the credulous . Recently we have witnessed the extraordinary career of John Alexander Dowie , " Elijah II , The Restorer , General Overseer of the Christian Catholic Church in Zion , " who made himself a multi-millionaire through the gullibility of his followers . Christian Science , so-called , has attracted many thousands by its radical optimism , its promise of physical health , and its frank abandonment of most of the older dogmas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctrinal upheaval that is gradually changing the basis of authority in religion from ecclesiastical pronouncement and written word to reason and experience . Meanwhile , as doctrines confront one another and crumble , more and more emphasis is laid upon the necessity and transcendent worth of the Christian Life . Churches of widely different beliefs are learning to cooperate for human uplift and to emphasize what they have in common rather than their creedal differences . In general , the thought of Christendom less and less concerns itself with another world , but sets itself the task of bettering this world . The Institutional Church , the Y.M.C.A. , and kindred organizations , draw attention to the need of social regeneration . Some churches have arisen which discard the traditional beliefs in toto , and make their basis of fellowship solely the endeavor after the spiritual life , the life of purity and service . Thus , through all doctrinal changes , and although the intellectual formulation of the religion is profoundly changing , the Chris- // tian Ideal remains practically what it was to the earliest disciples , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the essential features of Mohammedanism ? Six centuries after the birth of Christianity another Semitic religion emerged from the East , this time from Arabia , spread with extraordinary rapidity , and became , in point of numbers , one of the great religions of mankind . Mohammed , although unable to read or write , and of a rather morbid , neurotic temperament , had a gift of eloquent speech , with great personal magnetism , and aroused a fanatical devotion to his person and his teachings . By no means an impostor , he had a profound belief in himself , intense earnestness and sincerity in his mission , and accomplished reforms of importance for his people . From his childhood he was subject to trances and visions ; and he undoubtedly believed himself , like the Old Testament prophets , ? whom he in many respects resembled , ? directly inspired and commissioned of God . It is true that in his later years he became an opportunist , manufactured visions to suit his needs , and blackened his record by some treacherous and cruel acts . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was truly national and religious . In the year 622 A.D. he made the famous journey ? the Hegira ? from Mecca to Medina , which has since become the starting-point of Moslem chronology . From that time on his success was meteoric ; and before he died , a decade later , he stood at the head of a great politico-religious empire . As is always the case with great religious or political successes , Mohammed appeared at just the right moment . The Arabian peoples were experiencing a great renaissance and a religious unrest ; their sense of nationality was coming to consciousness , and a population grown too large for the sterile peninsula was on the point of one of those periodic // overflows such as have so largely shaped the history of man . Mohammed 's great work lay in unifying this people . It was their differing worship that most kept them apart ; and by . his war-cry , " There is One God , and Mohammed is his prophet ! " he took the most effective means toward their consolidation . There was already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Christian ideas had played considerable part therein . But it was reserved - " or Mohammed to complete the process . The unity and absolute sovereignty of Allah was his dominating idea ; all the other gods were to be viewed as created and subordinate beings . The simplicity and universality of the conception won rapid allegiance ; and the fierce Bedouin tribes united under the banner of Allah to spread their new gospel by the sword . By 700 A.D. the sway of the new religious state had become as wide as that of Christianity at the time of Constantine ; and but for its defeat by Charles Martel , at the battle of Tours , it might have overrun western Europe as it did Asia , Africa , and the Balkan peninsular . The chief religious value of Mohammedanism ? besides its banishing of earlier superstitions ? lies in its demand of absolute loyalty to Allah and acquiescence in his will . Allah is an absolute monarch , majestic , inscrutable , omnipotent ; there is in him a complete lack of the intimate fatherliness and love of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commands and the loyal submission to his will have brought a large measure of selflessness and peace into the hearts of devout Moslems . And the fatalistic view of his purposes has endowed them with a reckless courage unsurpassed in the history of man . The Mohammedan creed is militant , prescribing a Holy War against infidels ; it is lacking in the gentler and sweeter traits of Christianity ; and it has not hitherto proved progressive . It legitimates slavery , polygamy , easy divorce on the part of the husband , and promises // sexual delights in a very material Paradise . The humiliating position of women throughout the Mohammedan world of to-day is largely due to the insane jealousy of the Prophet . The injunction of almsgiving ? emphasized by Mohammed because of his own needy and orphaned childhood ? has been responsible for the maintenance of a perpetual horde of beggars wherever his doctrine is preached . The one great moral contribution of the religion is its prohibition of alco-holic drinks , which has kept the Mohammedan world reason-ably free from that curse of Christendom . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charm of style or orderly arrangement , is among the most tedious and confusing of sacred books . A collection of fragments of remembered dis-courses of the Prophet , made some time after his death , and arranged in order of length , it has been rather barren men-tal food for the millions whose religion it contains . On the whole , and apart from its initial value in consolidating and arousing a hitherto disorganized and inarticulate people , Mohammedanism seems to have little in it of the highest worth for mankind . SUMMARY OF PART I What has been the trend of religious evolution ? FROM the welter of primitive superstitions to the pure and noble ideals of Buddhism , Judaism , and Christianity is a far journey . But the causes that have produced these profound changes in belief and practice are , in general , not difficult to discern . We are not to think of the mere unfolding of a universal and always latent " religious instinct " ; nor is the road from the naive animism of savage peoples to the concepts of modern liberal religion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rather , there have been innumerable experiments and failures ; beliefs have dawned , thrilled their converts , and disappeared ; the religions that have survived have grown far from the visions of their founders , and show the marks of many a struggle and change . In this sphere , as everywhere , the evolutionary process has produced widely different results under differing conditions . And if a large proportion of living men to-day subscribe to rather closely analogous creeds , it is simply because the intercommunication of modern life , together with the many unifying forces at work , has made it possible for a few faiths to override and supersede their numerous rivals . Religion is , at its beginning , not something new injected , into human life ; it emerges rather through that gradual differentiation of human interests which also marked out the spheres of art and science . Closely bound up with the social structure of primitive life , the development of religious ideas is to be explained largely in terms of contemporary social and intellectual change . Whatever activities and ideas and // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be reflected in religious practices . Thus religious evolution is not a self-contained process , carrying within itself its own explanation , as an acorn might be said to contain the germ of all that the oak is to be . On the contrary , a religion may veer in any direction , under the influence of current science and philosophy , the conscious or unconscious manipulation of priests , the political status and cultural development of the people . The mutual intercourse of tribes brought alien products into the various home-grown cults ; and the eventual dominance of one or other was determined chiefly by the physical su-periority of the conquering nations . Great personalities moulded the religion of their countrymen in the direction of their personal visions and ideals . The innumerable forces at work shaping tribal or national morals put their stamp equally upon religious practices and ideas , which are in early life a hardly distinguishable aspect thereof . ' Yet , as in the case of moral evolution , so in religious evo-lution , a few simple constant forces determine in the end the direction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there is in the long run a natural selection for survival of those that meet certain underlying human needs . These needs are threefold : for consolation , for in-spiration , and for comprehension . In general , and in the long run , those conceptions tend to prevail which are happier and more hopeful ; those which are more moral , or spiritual ? i.e. , which lead the believer into the better ways of life ; and those which are more rational , more in harmony with men 's observations of what is true or probable . Such beliefs have an inherent stability which is lacking to the gloomy or fearful beliefs , to the immoral practices , and to the more fantastic and obviously irrational conceptions . It is impos- // sible for most of us to-day to believe , for example , in original sin and predestination to damnation ; to worship the cruel and immoral gods of Babylon ? or , for that matter , of the prophet Samuel ' or of Calvin ; to take seriously the pre-dicted world-catastrophes of the book of Revelation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from observable tend-encies , the goal of religious evolution would seem to be a faith that shall be cheering , pure in its morality , and in har-mony with the dicta of our scientific knowledge of the world . The most striking example of the working of the first of these three forces is to be found in the growth and spread of monotheism . Polytheism , although a more natural and instinctive reaction to the complex and often opposed forces of nature , leaves the mind confused and hope uncertain . However favorably disposed a god may be , his power is lim-ited by that of other and perhaps less beneficent beings . Athene , for example , was sure to work for the city that bore her name ; but Hera 's power was also to be reckoned with . Jehovah would fight for his tribes , but so would Baal and Chemosh for theirs . Only when the belief should grow up in a single god of all peoples , all-powerful and beneficent , could men feel wholly confident in his strength . Such a belief grew up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causes . But the monotheism of the Greeks was too spec-ulative , too lacking in roots in the soil , to spread far beyond the circle of the educated or survive the overthrow of Hel-lenic culture . The monotheism of the Brahmanic priests was likewise too speculative , and lacking in warmth of hu-man interests and idealism , so that it waned before the more spiritual atheism of Buddha ? although the hunger for a God in whom to trust quickly found another object in the worship of Buddha himself . But the monotheistic development of greatest ultimate // significance was that which took place within the Hebrew religion . The enhancement of Jehovah 's powers until he came to be thought of as the only god worthy of worship , and finally as the only existing god , was a process much closer to the practical life of men ; it was linked with historical and local events , and brought into play the patriotism and moral fervor of an intense and ardent people . Instead of offering a vague hope , such as we find in Marcus Aurelius , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be patiently , even loyally , acquiesced in , it brought , in its eventual form , a pledge to the individual of the fulfillment of his personal hopes and longings . A belief so inspiring as this found ready and tenacious acceptance ; no wonder that it swept over the western world . What made it prevail was , of course , not any evidence of its truth , but the immense consolation and hope it brought to the hearts of men . The prevailing power of the higher moral conceptions in a religion is to be seen in the rise of many faiths , as , notably , Zoroastrianism and Buddhism . But its most striking example is the prophetic movement among the Hebrews , culminating in the tender and noble ideals of Christ and the early Christians . The dominance of Christianity is to be explained quite as much on the ground of the greater spirituality of its ideals as on the ground of its consolation and hope . Finally , the survival value of rationality in a religion is best seen in the conflict of beliefs within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by which those forms of the religion which are most sharply in conflict with reason and science are becoming discredited and yielding place to interpretations of the faith that are consonant with the intellectual outlook of the modern world . CHAPTER IX THE GOD OF EXPERIENCE WE have now glanced at the most significant landmarks in the history of religion , and are in a position to pick out its essential phenomena for closer scrutiny . Most prominent , perhaps , among these phenomena is the group of beliefs and attitudes and acts that cluster about the concept of God . . ind so we may appropriately begin our psychological analysis of religion by asking what the idea of God has meant to men . We are not yet to raise the philosophical ? or theological ? questions involved , to ask what the objective nature of God is , or to explain metaphysically his relation to the universe . We are to ask the prior question , How is God revealed in human experience ? or ? to put it in other terms ? What in our human experience gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thought of God has in religion does not depend primarily upon any theory , and is not a mere matter of postulates or hopes or a blind act of credulity . It rests rather upon a solid foundation of experience . Godexperiences ( if we may use the phrase ) are primary , Godtheories are secondary . And even if our theorizing , our theistic arguments and theodicies , reach no conclusion satisfactory to the intellect , these significant experiences remain indisputable and precious ; even were we to give up the name God , the Reality which we seek to express thereby would remain , of profound and momentous importance in the religious life of man . How does God appear in human experience ? I. God in nature . The concept of God came into existence historically , as we saw in our opening chapter , in three // principal ways ; it was the crystallization of the awe and reverence and fear and hope felt in the contemplation of nature , in the thought of deceased heroes believed to be still alive , in the response to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the convergence of these three great streams of mental tendency , we may detect the basic source of the Christian doctrine of the Trinity . God about us and beyond us , in the vastness of the cosmic life ; God in Christ , the highest type of human hero , who sums up in himself , as it were , the spiritual power in other lives upon which we must lean ; God in our own hearts , the Holy Spirit in us , to which we must give our whole allegiance if we would find lasting satisfaction and peace ? our modern trinitarian conception , derived as it has been by a devious and blind process of intuition and reflection , has after all departed not so very far from primitive man 's spontaneous reactions to the great and mysterious forces without and within him . Man 's earliest attitudes toward nature took a polytheistic bent , because the world seems at first an arena in which multitudinous diverse forces act and react upon one another . But in proportion as the world-life becomes understood , its underlying unity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is reached , and from whatever causes it wins ascendency in men 's hearts , it does certainly best fit in with our modern thought of the world as a universe . This universe we describe , as best we can , fragmentarily and imperfectly , in terms of natural law . But the mechanical aspect of the world-process is but one aspect . From the scientific point of view the universe may turn out to be throughout a vast machine . But , if so , that will still not be the whole story about it . For our worldly , industrial life this will be its most important aspect ; but not for our emotional , contemplative , aesthetic , moral , religious life . The world will still be infinitely beautiful , ineffably wonderful , // endlessly inspiring ; it will still be the source and matrix of all that is best in us , and the guaranty of the eventual dominance of that best . Regular and clock-like as may be the processes of its life-history , that life will nevertheless be moving on , irresistibly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Whatever else may be true of the cosmos , this also is true , and is the significant fact for our religious life ; it is so constituted as to develop in us a spiritual life , and to push us , whether we will or no , into that spiritual life ; it is a world-process that makes toward an ideal . It were a sad incident in the intellectual and practical development of man if he should lose this primitive awe and humility before the beauty and wonder of the world . " You remember that fancy of Plato 's , of a man who had grown to maturity in some dark distance , and was brought on a sudden into the upper air to see the sun rise . What would his wonder be , his rapt astonishment at the sight we daily witness with indifference ! With the free open sense of a child , yet with the ripe faculty of a man , his whole heart would be kindled by that sight , he would discern it well to be Godlike , his soul would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This green , flowery , rock-built earth , the trees , the mountains , rivers , many-sounding seas ; ? that great deep sea of azure that swims overhead ; the winds sweeping through it ; the black cloud fashioning itself together , now pouring out fire , now hail and rain ; what is it ? Aye , what ? At bottom we do not yet know ; we can never know at all . It is not by our superior insight that we escape the difficulty ; it is by our superior levity , our inattention , our want of insight . It is by not thinking that we cease to wonder at it . . . . This world , after all our science and sciences , is still a miracle , wonderful , inscrutable , magical and more , to whosoever will think of it . ... What is it ? Ah , an unspeakable , Godlike thing ; toward which the best attitude for us , after never so much science , // is awe , devout prostration and humility of soul ; worship , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To primeval men , all things and everything they saw exist beside them were an emblem of the Godlike , of some God . And look what peren-nial fibre of truth was in that . To us also , through every star , through every blade of grass , is not a God made visible , if we will open our minds and eyes ? . . . Every object has a divine beauty in it . . . is a window through which we may look into Infinitude itself . " 1 The great seers and poets have been men who have felt more vividly than the average man the presence of this God " in whom we live and move and have our being . " To the psalmist " the heavens declare the glory of God " ; for Wordsworth there is in nature " A presence that disturbs me with the joy Of elevated thoughts ; a sense sublime Of something far more deeply interfused , Whose dwelling is the light of setting suns , And the round ocean and the living air , And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A motion and a spirit , that impels All thinking things , all objects of all thought , And rolls through all things . " 2 In similar vein Max Muller writes , " Look at the dawn , and forget for a moment your astronomy ; and I ask you whether , when the dark veil of the night is slowly lifted , and the air becomes transparent and alive , and light streams forth , you know not whence , you would not feel that your eye were looking into the very eye of the Infinite ? " And Emerson , " If the stars should appear one night in a thousand years , how would men believe and adore ; and preserve for many // generations the remembrance of the city of God which had been shown ! But every night come out these envoys of beauty , and light the universe with their admonishing smile . ... All natural objects make a kindred impression , when the mind is open to their influence . . . . In the woods , we return to reason and faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bathed by the blithe air , and uplifted into infinite space , ? all mean egotism vanishes . I become a transparent eyeball ; I am nothing ; I see all ; the currents of the Univer-sal Being circulate through me ; I am part or particle of God . " 1 In such moments of insight the religious man finds an added inspiration in the thought that he is himself a part of this divine order which overwhelms his imagination , caught by the same resistless currents of being , and sharing the universal destinies . No amount of scientific analysis and de-scription can annul the truth of these hours of vision . And so , " when men say , As for God , we know nothing of him ; science knows nothing of him ; it is a name belonging to an extinct system of philosophy ' ; I think they are playing with words . By what name they call the object of their contem-plation is in itself a matter of little importance . Whether they say God , or prefer to say Nature , the important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a Power to all appearance infinite and eternal , a Power to which their own being is inseparably connected , in the knowledge of whose ways alone is safety and wellbeing , in the contempla-tion of which they find a beatific vision . . . . I can not believe any religion to be healthy that does not start from Nature-worship. " 2 II . God in our hearts ? the Holy Spirit . The contempla-tive side of religion , the vision of God in nature , is important and abiding . But the directest avenue to God is through // obedience ; he is not so much in the wind or the earthquake or the fire as in the still , small voice within us ; and it is the pure in heart that see God . In the uprush of noble feeling and high resolve , in the power for good that wells up , some-times so unexpectedly , within us , God is most surely re-vealed . It matters little whether this inflow of the Holy Spirit can be described or not in natural terms ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working , but be-cause its influence in our life is divine . The practically sig-nificant fact is that if we open our hearts , God will enter in and regenerate our lives ; this power is ready for our use if we will cease to kick against the pricks , and lay hold of it . There , within us , is to be found not only our selfishness and our passion , but at least a seed of the Divine Will ; and so all-important is this fact that religion has been defined as the life of God in the soul of man . Even when he sins and for-gets God , this fountain of good is still invisibly within him , abiding even amid the riot and jungle of his inmost life , ever and again reminding him that there is a law above his own will which he may not , at his peril , disobey . i By the " fear of God " truly religious men have meant , not their terror at a hostile environment , but their recognition of the authority of this higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take is not to be decided by our impulse or fancy ; it is decreed from the beginning of the world . If we infringe these eternal laws , framed in the very constitution of the universe , we can not escape the penalty . " The fear of the Lord ? that is wisdom ; to depart from evil // is understanding . " 1 " 0 Lord , I know that the way of man is not in himself ; it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps . " 2 That this unescapable authority of God has been supposed to imply a literal oral command by a " magnified , non-natural man , " a tribal patron-god speaking from his home on his SacredMountain , need not disturb us ; though no finger of Jehovah wrote the decalogue , it is no less bind-ing upon us . No rationalization of religion can make duty less divine . Who is the fool who says there is no God ? He is the moral nihilist , the cynic , or the worldly man , who laughs at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " though there be many devices in a man 's heart , the counsel of the Lord , that shall stand . " But this fear of God , in the truly devout and aspiring soul , becomes the deepest joy ; in loyalty to the God within him he finds the only road to lasting peace . He is now bound to his brother-men by the deepest bond ; for the God-element in him is akin to that in them , a spark from the same eternal Ere . Each separate reaching out for the good , each act of self-sacrifice , is felt not as standing alone , but as a part of the seeking and working of mankind toward God ; or , to put it the other way , as a part of the gradual realization of God in human life . // III . God in Christ . But if in some degree in all of us the Holy Spirit lives , it is especially incarnate in the spiritual heroes of mankind ; and above all ? for us , at least , of Chris-tendom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and focus the religious ideal for mankind " ; i he is the supreme incarnation of the Divine in human nature ; so that the words could fitly be put into his mouth , " He that hath seen me bath seen the Father . " 2 We need not , therefore , however rationalistic our temper , balk at the phraseology that calls Christ divine ; the truth that is to be conveyed by such lan-guage is not inconsistent with a truly historical view of his life and teachings , and does not necessarily imply anything miraculous or supernatural . To the popular mind , indeed , Jesus has often figured as very God ; but the deity and the divinity of Christ are far from identical conceptions . The Church in its official dogma has steadily clung to the asser-tion that Jesus was thoroughly human ; his divineness was only such as could be expressed in a human life . His will was wholly merged with the will of God , there was no selfishness left in him , no self-indulgence ; it was his meat to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divine life for men , the measure of the amount of godliness that our nature is capable of . To call his life divine is not in the least to assert that Jesus was born of a virgin , wrought miracles , or rose from the tomb ; it is an entirely different sort of judgment , a value-judgment . The facts about his life must be decided by histor-ical methods , as we would sift the records of the life of any other personage of the past ; no ardent believer or intrenched ecclesiasticism ought to attempt to bias the impartial judg-ment of scholars upon them . But the question of the divineTIIE // ness of this life is to be decided by men of spiritual vision . And the verdict of truly religious men is all but unanimous ; the great warrior , the great statesman , the great inventor , the great poet , have a veritable spark of God in them ; but the life that is most truly divine , that most fully reaches up to God , is the life of purity and charity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all races and degrees of culture for the two millenniums since he lived , is the life of the carpenter of Nazareth . In view of the confusion in which the popular mind ? and the mind , we may add , of many a theologian ? has rested on this matter , it will be worth while to make more explicit what should have been clear enough from our study of the life of Christ , namely , his thoroughgoing humanity . En-crusted as the records are with miracles and marvels ? which it is by no means possible or desirable categorically to deny ? they do not fail to preserve hints and implications of his normal human limitations . He shared the physical weakness of men , being often weary and depressed , suffering all the anguish of other mortals as his cruel death drew near , and lacking strength to carry his cross . He shared the igno-rance of men , not only in his boyhood , ' but throughout his life ; the hour when the Messianic Kingdom was to be in-augurated he said that no man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play the leading part.2 He knew presum-ably no science , knew little of the life and history of the world , shared the local contemporary beliefs and hopes of his fellows , was possessed in the last months or years of his life by a passionate conviction which , in its literal form , can only be called a pathetic delusion . He was tempted , as all men are ; and we have no means of knowing , really , that he was // absolutely without sin . Human nature is not capable of om-nipotence or omniscience ; it is perhaps not capable of sin-lessness . But Christ can be all the more surely our model of inspiration if we can think of him as facing life with only such resources and faculties as other men have , and yet making out of them so sublime a life . Nor do we need to consider him as altogether unique in his divineness ; if he said , " I and my father are one , " he went on to pray that his disciples might be one with God even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divine life , he thought of them all as sons of God ; he was , as Paul said , but " the first born among many brethren , " i the first to find the secret of life which was open to all . " As many as received him , to them gave he power to become the sons of God . " 2 " The works that I do shall he do also , and greater works than these shall he do . " 3 We all have a spark at least of the di-vine in us , and may aim to attain to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ . " Was Christ a man like us ? Ah , let us try If we then too can be such men as he . " 4 We may not refuse to grant recognition to the divinity living in many a saint and prophet ; there is no honor to Christ in setting him utterly apart from his brethren . Nevertheless , as a matter of record , it was Christ who has done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense unique in the realm of the spiritual . He not only lived his life di-vinely , but he has been ever since drawing men unto him . Many humble Christians have come close to the pattern ; through their lives also God has been revealed . But after all , they are disciples ; Christ was master . He blazed the // path ; it is easier to follow . And such disciples are quickest to admit that they have fallen short of the pattern . " The difference between the Man of Galilee of the first century and the man of England and America in the nineteenth cen-tury , if I understand my gospels aright , is not in inherent capacity to draw near God , but in the relative degree of realization of a latent power common to humanity . It is this that has created the uniqueness of Jesus . " 1 Thus the doctrine of the Trinity , however foreign to our modern thought the terms in which the old creeds phrase it , has a very real basis in experience . If we try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is three persons and yet one , we may well balk at such an amazing example of the Greek genius for speculative subtleties . But if we take the conception in its inner and rational sense , we shall recog-nize that Christians attain to the vision of God in three lead-ing ways ? through the contemplation of the outer world , through obedience to the Holy Spirit in their hearts , and through faith in their Master Christ . What is the nature of God as thus revealed ? God is usually conceived by the Christian as having consciousness , will , and emotions , as possessed of omniscience , omnipotence , and omnipresence , and as creator and ruler of the universe . Some of the arguments which are commonly offered in support of belief in these various attributes of God we shall discuss in due course . But it is only , at best , by some process of deduction that we can hope to arrive at such conceptions ; as actually revealed in experience , God is  - -  what we have just pointed out . God is the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that lives indestructibly in our own hearts , that burst into radiant flame in the soul // of Christ . The laws by which this Good works through the long evolutionary process we can dimly discern ; its supreme importance we universally acknowledge ; but what its ulti-mate nature , source , and goal may be is not writ upon the face of experience . We may then sympathize with Arnold 's protest against the current " insane license of affirmation about God " ; and , on the other hand , be tolerant and open-minded toward those conceptions of God ? pantheistic , deistic , naturalistic , or what not ? which are alien to that conception to which we have grown accustomed . ' But because we do not agree in our ideas of the objective nature of God , it by no means follows that there is any doubt of God 's reality . On the contrary , when men call themselves atheists and speak of the belief in God as exploded , it is some specific and elaborated conception of God of which they are thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belief or disbelief in the personality or the omnipo-tence of God , for example , is a matter for most serious thought , we must insist that to be unconvinced of these at-tributes is not at all to doubt the vital reality of God in the world and in our lives . ' There are hypotheses about God , // there may be a childlike trust in , say , Christ 's conception of God , there may be a hundred reasons for pinning our faith to this or that theistic doctrine ; but underneath these over-beliefs rests the basic fact that God exists ? that there is an Ideal working itself out in the historic process , a great Power irresistibly drawing us on to some far off and unknown goal , and demanding our entire allegiance . If we are tempted to become skeptical and discard the thought of God because we do not know what he is in him-self , we must remember that we know nothing of what any-thing is in itself , except our own conscious stream as it passes . These material things that surround @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our sense-organs give them . To a color-blind man the red flower is gray ; to other eyes it might be blue ; what is it for itself ? We absolutely do not know . Or what is electricity ? No one doubts its reality : we see it illuminating the arc-light , moving our trolley-cars , carrying our voices over the wires . But what is it ? We talk of electrons , of the ether ; but what are they ? When we see the forked lightning , we say " electricity , " we recognize the presence of a great power . When we see a sinner saved sud- // denly from despair and filled with a humble consciousness of victory over sin , we say " God " ; we recognize the presence of a power of vastly greater significance and far more worthy of our adoration . It is not a question of argument or proof , it is a question of sight ; God is not a hypothesis but a fact . Nor need we fret because our immediate knowledge of God is so limited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . We know that we are not alone in our endeavors , not futilely setting up mere subjective aspirations ; the universe is on the side of our better selves . We know that at all costs we must follow the gleam . ' It would be foolish , then , and fraught with danger , to cease from thinking and speaking of God because much of unso-phisticated man 's thought of God is shown to be naive and a projection of his own imagination . " To seek to discard , like some philosophers , the name of God and to substitute for it such a name as the Unknowable , will seem to a plain man , surely , ridiculous . For . . . no man could ever have cared anything about God in so far as he is simply unknow-able . . . . Men cared about God for the sake of what they knew about him , not of what they did not .... It adds , in-deed , to our awe of God that although we are able to know of him what so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but simply to be able to know nothing of him could beget in us no awe whatever . . . . Everything turns on its being at realities that this worship and its language are // aimed . Its anthropomorphic language about God is aimed at a vast , though ill-apprehended , reality . " i God is a real-ity ; and we must remember that though our actual experi-ence of God be narrowly limited , he may none the less be al that the faith of the saints has deemed him to be ? and how much more that we can not now imagine , that it hath not entered into the mind of man to conceive ! 2 But however this may be , the important thing is , not to assent to the truth of God 's existence , but to feel his reality and be dominated by it ; to recognize a Law above our pri-vate wills , to cast aside all willfulness and cynicism and little-mindedness , to acknowledge the infinite worth of life and the infinite importance of duty . The true atheism is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , a refusal to join forces with the great tides that are making for good in the world ; a despair of human life and a deafness to its summons . There is no merit or value in a belief in God that makes no practi-cal difference ; the only important thing is to get into our lives the great experiences and the vital faith which that word connotes . For though our definitions of God be differ-ent , and our opinions about him vary from age to age , if we have the fear and love of God in our hearts , our theological opinions are of little moment . // CHAPTER X SACRIFICE AND SIN INTIMATELY wrapped up with the concept of God are the allied concepts of sacrifice , sin , and salvation , which play a large role in the religious life . Born , like the idea of God , from the superstition and fear of primitive life , and having at the outset no spiritual value , these concepts have , like it , become gradually moralized until , in their highest expres-sions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the history of the concepts of sacrifice and sin ? ( 1 ) Primitive sacrifice i was an outward and unspiritual act , performed in the hope of winning the favor of the gods or averting harm from them . Their disfavor is not at first attributed to men 's sins , but is as capricious and irrational as the thunderbolts and storms and famines that are their weapons . Like the exacting and easily irritated tribal chiefs , they must be kept placated , must be propitiated if they become angry or for their own reasons threaten damage to the community or to the individual . ' All important under-takings require their help , or at least their non-interference , and must therefore be initiated by some offering to them.3 If the undertaking prospers , tribute must , in gratitude and with an eye to future favors , be awarded them . " If any act // unpleasing to them has been , however unwittingly , com-mitted , it must be promptly expiated , by the sacrifice of something precious to the worshipers and therefore to them . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoys the savory smell or in some invisible manner partakes of it.2 This sharing of a meal with the god forms a bond between him and his worshipers ; the notion of a blood-covenant thus ratified is found in many lands . ' So imminent loomed the potential wrath of the gods , and so anxiously was their assistance sought in the pressing struggles of early times , that among many peoples no animal food was eaten without the offering of a due share to them ; and multitudes of priests lived at ease upon these offerings of their fellows ' fear and credulity . In particular , any marked success might provoke the envy of the gods ; or else it was due to their help ; in either case it had to be followed by an apportionment to them of their share of the proceeds . The Jewish law required the sacrifice of the firstborn of every domestic animal , and the firstfruits of every harvest . Even the sacrifice of the firstborn child lingered into historic times in Israel . ; though as far back as the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an animal . ' ( 2 ) Sacrifice as propitiation , tribute , or covenant has nothing religious , in the better sense of the word , about it ; it is simply an act of worldly wisdom , involving no change of heart . Unhappily , such an unspiritual conception of sacri-fice has not yet been entirely outgrown ; the Jewish idea of the scapegoat ' persists in the theological conception of // Christ as a propitiatory sacrifice to save men from the pen-alty justly attaching to their sins . But this merely exterior nature of sacrifice discredited it in the eyes of the great prophets of Israel , and they discarded it altogether . Jehovah , they said , desires mercy and not sacrifice . " Math Jehovah as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of Jehovah ? Behold , to obey is better than sacri-fice , and to hearken than the fat of rains . " " Sacrifice and offering thou hast no delight in . " " Thou delightest not in sacrifice , else would I give it ; thou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ righteousness and justice is more accept-able to Jehovah than sacrifice . " " What unto me is the multitude of your sacrifices , saith Jehovah ; wash you , make you clean , cease to do evil , learn to do well . " " For I desire goodness and not sacrifice . " 1 This point of view was taken by Christ ; and the early Christians understood that the whole Jewish sacrificial system was definitely abrogated.2 ( 3 ) But while this tendency to let the ancient custom of sacrifice lapse prevailed ultimately among most peoples , among the Jews and Christians another idea won its way , namely , the transformation of sacrifice from an outward to an inward matter . Some of the keenest Hebrew moralists made effective use of the old phraseology and ingrained habits of the people by demanding , not the abolition of sac-rifice , but the substitution of a new and higher form of sac-rifice . " Offer sacrifices of righteousness . " " The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit ; a broken and a contrite heart , O God , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conception , blending admirably with the Christian gospel , found notable expression in apostolic teaching . What was demanded by // God was no longer a material gift , the renunciation of some worldly possession , but the gift of a pure and loving heart , the renunciation of selfish and sensual desires . " I beseech you , therefore , brethren , to present your bodies a living sacrifice , holy , acceptable to God ? which is your rational worship . " " To do good and to share forget not ; for with such sacrifices God is well pleased . " To-day in the vener-able Greek and Roman Catholic churches the primitive conception of penance and propitiation still to some extent persists ; but wherever liberal conceptions of Christianity prevail it has been quite supplanted by the more rational 7 and spiritual idea . God does not need to be appeased ; we need to be cleansed . The eternal laws of life demand sacri-fice ? not for those laws ' sake , but because , ultimately , human welfare itself requires it . And however pathetic and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course of history in the name of religion , man has been through them stumbling and groping toward the great truth that the best way of life is the way of sacri-fice of desire ? that he must lose his life who would truly find it . Parallel with this evolution of the idea of sacrifice has gone an evolution of the idea of sin . Early religion every-where includes a sense of frequent transgression , with an accompanying fear of disaster , attempts at purification , and anguish of heart.2 There was little thought of why an act // was wrong ; it was simply taboo , it must not be done . Even acts that were necessary , such as the killing of enemies , the handling of sick people and corpses , midwifery , and the like , produced a feeling of aversion and pollution and a sense of the need of purification ; the old Jewish laws are very exact-ing in their demands in all such cases . Mishaps were usually attributed to some , perhaps unconscious , impropriety ; espe-cially tribal catastrophes were a sign that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be more and more clearly personified , these transgressions became distinctly offenses against them ; to learn to obey their will became an elaborate art , bringing into being oracles , soothsayers , augurs , and the like . But still sin was an outward matter , denoting no more than ignorant blunder , heedless folly , for-getfulness or indifference ; unwitting , even well-intentioned or unavoidable transgression brought on its penalty as well as perverse or passionate disobedience . ' The sense of sin was simply the uneasy feeling of having incurred punish-ment ; and the rituals of purification had for their object to wipe off a stain almost as material as blood upon the hands . Here , too , however , the vision of the Hebrew prophets saw clearly ; to them the important matter was not the outward act , but the inward loyalty or disobedience . Purity became a matter , not of proper observance , but of intent , of the direction of desire and the meditations of the heart . Jesus put it in classic form in his saying , " There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defile him ; but the things which proceed out of the man are those that defile him .... For from within , out of the heart of men , evil thoughts proceed . . . and defile the man . " 2 A similar moralization of the concept of sin and purity is // to be traced in other religions . In the Buddhist scriptures we read , " Neither abstinence from fish or flesh , nor going naked , nor shaving the head . . . nor sacrifices to Agni , will cleanse a man . Reading the Vedas , making offerings to priests . . . these do not cleanse a man . Anger , drunkenness , obstinacy , bigotry . . . these constitute uncleanness. " i In the Zend Avesta , " Purity is for man , next to life , the highest od ; that purity , 0 Zarathustra , that is in the religion of Mazda for him who cleanses himself with good thoughts , words , and deeds . " And in the later Ilellenic religion we have sentiments like this from the Golden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only divine service . " Thus from a superstitious uneasiness at vague and ill-understood dangers , and a frantic search for deliverance from impinging pollu-tion , there was evolved here and there in the clearing consciousness of men a loathing of those acts and desires that led them from their own ideals and blurred their vision of God . What are their dangers ? The Emperor Julian , cleaving , in a world rapidly growing Christian , to the sturdy pagan ideals , scorning the senti-mentalism and self-distrust which was becoming the fashion , is reported to have said on his deathbed , " I die without remorse , as I have lived without sin . " And many a modern thinker ? Sir Oliver Lodge is one of the latest ? has said that men ought to concern themselves little with sin and sacrifice , but rather with positive effort and achievement . Certainly the sense of sin and the pursuit of purity have had their distortions and dangers for men ; what these are we may now pause to note . ( 1 ) Too dominant a sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gain won through the resulting power // over temptation , and indeed may even paralyze effort . Religious chronicles are full of the distress and overconscien-tiousness and despair of reasonably good men . St. Paul could call himself the chief of sinners ; 1 and a hundred parallels could be found in the utterances of the saints to his outburst , " I know that in me , that is , in my flesh , dwell-eth no good thing ; for to will is present with me , but to do that which is good , is not . For the good that I would I do not , but the evil that I would not , that I do . . . . For I de-light in the law of God in the inward man , but I see a differ-ent law in my members , warring against the law of my mind , and bringing me into captivity under the law of sin which is in my members . 0 wretched man that I am ! who shall de-liver me out of this mortal body ? " Modern church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have all sinned and there is no health in us . " " Lord have mercy upon us , miser-able sinners ! " There is in this groveling and self-distrusting attitude a lack of grit or nerve which revolts the manly soul ; and religion , countenancing such flabby self-abasement , has seemed to many a morbid and sickly affair . ( 2 ) The longing for purity has led some men to a futile asceticism , wherein a cruel self-repression has been practiced , apart from its excuse in the real needs of life . St. Simeon Stylites on his pillar , the whirling dervishes of India , the self-torturing Mohammedan fanatics , the hermits , with their ceaseless scourgings and fastings and mortifications of the flesh , ? these have distorted the true spirit of religion , which should bring men life , and life more abundantly . " An overemphasis upon self-denial sacrifices unnecessarily the sweetness and richness of life , stunts it , distorts it , robs it of its natural fruition . The denial of any satisfaction is cruel except as it is necessary . Purity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the virtue of frugality became the vice of a starvation diet , producing the emaciated and weak-ened saints . The attempt radically to alter and repress human nature is nearly always disastrous . Most of the ascetics had to pass their days in constant struggles against their temptations ; and many of them recurrently lapsed into wild orgies of sin , the result of pent-up impulses denied their natural channels . " ' A pure religion rejects these de-formations of its spirit . In so far as renunciation is necessary it brings to it a gladness of endurance ; beyond that stern necessity it bids us not repress but develop our natures ; it comes not to destroy but to fulfill. ( 3 ) Another distortion to which the striving for purity is subject lies in the extreme of unworldliness . Worldliness consists in forgetting the ends of life in absorption in the means . The business man who gives his whole thought to making money without learning to use it well , the ambitious politician who spends his life in seeking office without think-ing how through the office he may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days to dressmakers and milliners , all those whose minds are occupied with the mere instru-ments and mechanism of life , are choked with the tares of worldliness . They may live on a higher plane than the idler or debauche ; they may escape the worst pitfalls of life ; but they do not attain to its highest rewards . The unworldly man sees deeper into life , lays hold of the eternal things ; if he seeks wealth or fame , or cultivates society , it is for the ideal ends he can attain therethrough , for the better service of his fellows or of God . So far unworldliness is good . But it may easily go too far , becoming a dread of contamination by the ordinary machin-ery of life . When the longing to keep himself unspotted from the world leads a man to become a hermit or an idle monk , // to spend his days in useless vigils and prayers instead of using his strength for active service , it may bring him an inner peace ; it may , by removing him from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaves him a useless encum-brance upon the earth . The truly religious man , though not of the world is yet in it , sharing its burdens , meeting its temptations , willingly letting himself be tainted , if need be , by its dirt and squalor , so his arm can be of use and his determination avail in some degree for his fellows . The anchoritie and monastic ideals of the Middle Ages did enor-mous harm in absorbing the spiritual enthusiasm of the men who might otherwise have put their energies and idealism into regenerating in some measure the life of the age . ' What is their permanent value ? Morbid and perverted in such ways the sense of sin and the longing for purity may become . We should by all means seek to avoid these excesses and to cultivate something of the healthy common sense of the Greeks , while following the deeper insight and finer ideals of Christianity . But if not carried too far , the sense of sin and the sting of remorse are valuable auxiliaries to the positive religious impulse , never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all is said , the power of temptation still remains strong for poor stumbling human nature ; and the religious life must be for most men a militant life . If we agree with Arnold that " All thinking about sin beyond what is indispensable for the firm effort to get rid of it is waste of energy and waste of time , " we must also realize the truth of his further words , " This sense of sin , however , it is also possible to have not strongly enough to beget the firm effort to get rid of it . " 2 The danger of our // times lies rather in this latter direction , in ceasing to think enough of the awfulness of sin . This at least can be confi-dently said : if our theory of life includes no sacrifice , no stern self-repression , if it makes life out to be an easy task and offers impulse and passion right of way , it is a mistaken theory . Success in life is not to be so cheaply bought . The prohibition is not external @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature ; sin is the wreck of life , and purity its natural ideal . ' Religion has , therefore , been right , not only in demanding instant and unquestioning obedience to the right , but in bidding a man hate the wrong and label it by an odious name . His inner conflicts are thereafter no longer between two opposing impulses that differ only in relative worth , they are between Right and Wrong , between Duty and Sin . The first stage of the religious life begins at the point when a man accepts what were else merely an expedient manner of life as unconditionally binding upon him , as the will of God . The highest stage is reached when all his random and mistaken impulses are eradicated , when he no longer desires to follow anything but the right , and out of the snare of temptation has emerged into the blessedness that belongs to the pure in heart . But because absolute purity is beyond the attainment of mortal men , religion lies chiefly along the road , in the yearning and aspiring life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but struggles ever on and on // toward perfection . From the first conception of an objective duty that has authority over his subjective caprices and personal desires , a duty grudgingly and heavily obeyed , religion develops into an ardent pursuit of righteousness , a happy and whole-hearted dedication to an ideal of life . The saints and the great religious teachers have been those who have loved purity and seen the beauty of holiness . In the Psalms , in the teachings of Jesus , in the letters of Paul , we have the classic expressions of delight in the law of righteousness . Renunciation , instead of being a grim necessity , is welcomed with open arms ; self-denial is no longer a yoke and a burden , to be borne because there is no way of escape , it has become the deepest desire of the heart . Such is the temper of the deeply religious man : he loves Duty not only because it is the only path to sustained happiness , but for its own glorious sake . He says , ? " I give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give as living impulses . " The ultimate goal of the religious life ? of any worthy life ? is indeed service , achievement ; but achievement unspotted and unhampered by selfishness , by sensuality , by worldliness and sin . All indolence and frivolity , all coarseness and dissipation , all gluttony and immoderation and drunkenness and lust , are its eternal enemies . From the clutch of these passions man climbs toward the heights where he shall no longer hear the seductive voice of temptation , where his will shall be in harmony with the will of God , the will which the ideal of his life prescribes . Between these two poles of the animal life and the ideal life lies his pilgrim 's progress ; from the world of unchecked inclination he journeys over a long and toilsome road , with much effort and travail of spirit , to the spiritual world , which is the world of : , erfected human nature . // The doctrine of Original Sin To the great idealists sin has often appeared not merely as an individual matter but as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , were sweeping in their denunciation of the general wickedness of men . That this omnipresent wickedness dated back to the first man and was due to his original fall from innocence , came to be a popularly accepted belief . We find it in some of the Apocryphal writings that preceded the Christian era ; and Paul fitted it into his conglomerate theological structure . " As through one man sin entered into the world , and death through sin , and so death passed unto all men , for that all sinned ? as through the one man 's disobedience the many were made sinners , even so through the obedience of the One shall the many be made righteous . " Such an assertion of universal depravity was plausible in that age , when the old virtues were tottering and the new had only begun to appear . To Paul it was a matter of plain observation : " Jews and Greeks ? they are all under sin ; as it is written , there is none righteous , no , not one . " On himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my heart , in the law of God ; but I see a different law in my body , warring against the law of my mind , and bringing me into captivity under the law of sin which is in my body . " Under this curse " the whole crea-tion groaneth and travailleth till now . i To Paul the important matter was the fact of universal sinfulness and the need of salvation ; Adam was useful rhetorically , to contrast with Christ ? the first sinner with the first sinless man . But the Christian fathers , with their hunger for theoretical precision , crystallized his hints into a hard-and-fast doctrine of Original Sin . Adam 's sin has demoralized the race ; his guilt is transmitted to us all , and // we are hopelessly entangled unless the supernatural grace of Christ is accepted . St. Augustine , in particular , con-verted in middle life after a youth whose wildness he after-ward , by a natural psychological tendency , exaggerated into unrelieved blackness , saddled upon the Church the convic-tion of man 's natural depravity . ' But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gloomy view of human nature was bound to give way . Par-ticularly in America , with its unbounded hopes and its freedom from old-world problems , the sense of the natural goodness of man , already vigorously preached by the eight-eenth century romanticists , became dominant ; and the offi-cial pessimistic doctrine of the Church appeared a sad and chilling untruth . " The progress of society , " said Channing , " is retarded by nothing more than by the low views which its leaders are accustomed to take of human nature . " " It is a duty to estimate highly the nature which God has given . It should be regarded with reverence , rather than con-tempt. " 2 And Emerson cried out impatiently to his Divinity School listeners , " None believeth in the soul of man , but only in some man or person old and departed . " To the modern man there is evidently truth on both sides of the controversy . Man is neither inherently bad nor in-herently good . No impulse or instinct is in itself evil ; but any may lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tendencies that bring pain and wrong and pre-mature death ; from the burden of these passions men have universally longed to be delivered . We do start handicapped // and hampered by this common human inheritance ; we are all potentially sinful before our first sinful act , there is in us a predisposition to evil . The doctrine of the Fall puts into the form of a single historical incident what is really a general truth about human nature ? the fact that its present state does not correspond to its real estate . Not only the Hebrews , with their unusually acute consciousness of short-coming or imperfection , but many other races , have postu-lated a golden age in the past wherein this discordance did not exist . Anthropology discredits such an idea ; there has not been any general degeneration . But universally , prac-tice does not correspond to ideal . A truer formulation of the fact which the doctrine of the Fall has sought to explain would be to say that man has not fallen , he has never risen to his potentialities , or found the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But if there is weakness and imperfection in us all , there is also much good in us all ; any normal child , if rightly trained , and subjected to just the right influences , could become a saint . If some seem so hopelessly fallen as to need supernatural grace , it is for lack of the proper influences at the right time . Environment is more responsiblethan heredity . Nor need we trouble ourselves about predestina-tion and election . Some undoubtedly start better off than others ; modern science is showing why , and pointing the way toward an ultimate improvement . In this matter we have more to learn from eugenics than from theology . We shall always have to fight against the evil tendencies inseparable from human nature ; but proper breeding and training of the human species can remove from the situation most of its hopeless aspects . The doctrine of the inevitable sinfulness of man has had its day . // CHAPTER XI SALVATION , CONVERSION , AND ATONEMENT What is the meaning of salvation ? IDEALLY , there ought to be no need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a race of men adapted to their environment and able to live in harmony and inner peace . This , however , is but a remote ideal ; actually , most men have consciously failed in adjustment somewhere , and felt the need of salvation . Most men at one time or other have cried out as Paul did , " To will is present with me , but to do that which is good is not . . . . Wretched man that I am , who shall deliver me from this body of death ! " To the felt need of deliverance from sin there has generally been added the dread of the punishment of sin , the fear of future retri-bution . To be saved meant to the early Christian propa-gandists the promise of admittance to the Messianic King-dom shortly to be set up by Christ ; to the modern evangelist it means escape from the torments of hell and the hope of sharing the delights of heaven . But this aspect of salvation need not concern us here ; ' it has varied with the differing conceptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a matter of speculation or faith rather than of actual experience . What we have to consider is rather the means of escape from sin here and now ; a matter as to which practi-cally the whole human race are in the same case , and which can be discussed independently of theological or eschato-logical dogmas . There is a modern tendency to discard the terms " salva ( ( // tion , " " conversion , " " regeneration , " and the like , because they have become colored for most of us by theological pre-suppositions and often applied to acts and forms which have no real spiritual value . Baptism , partaking of the wine and bread , confession , joining the church , profession of belief , ? such outward acts are symbolical and suggestive , but have no direct intrinsic efficacy . All assumption by any church of power to save men or to pronounce them saved , except as they actually experience an inward change , is sheer inso-lence . Nor can we in these days hold that only Christians have been saved a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have peopled the earth . Salvation , de-liverance from sin , is open to all . Jew and Christian , Brah-man and Buddhist , have felt alike the need of it ; and by all the great faiths the way of salvation has in some measure been found : in some measure ? for there are degrees of salvation . We can no longer separate men into sheep and goats , the saved and the lost ; moral differences are infi-nitely numerous , and no man is wholly good or bad . There are indeed cases of abrupt transition from great sinfulness to purity ; but more often salvation has to be worked out grad-ually through years of effort and failure . ' Yet , if it is true that salvation has come in greater or lesser degree to multitudes of men of all faiths , it is also true that it has come in most striking measure through Christ . No other power ever let loose in the world has accomplished nearly so much in freeing men from the bondage of sin as the power of his life and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sin-ridden men is that of overcoming evil with good ; a great love , a great loyalty , can banish temptations against which a direct struggle is futile . So a spiritual union with Christ has for millions wrought that transformation of char-acter which we call regeneration ; and the surest way to save men who have sunk far into sin has proved to be , after win-ning their will to repent , to bring them to Christ . What is the meaning and value of conversion ? When a man , after a life of indifference to spiritual values , is suddenly saved from such religious apathy , roused to a new set of interests , delivered from the power of sin ? and therefore from its consequences , natural or supernatural ? we call him converted . " Conversion " means , literally , a " turning round " ; the term is usually restricted to cases of a turning from a lower to a higher level of life . ' Conversion is not by any means always accompanied by extremes of nerv-ous excitement ; on the contrary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is by no means always abrupt ; rather , it may be so gradual as to have no special significant moments to mark the change of heart . There are all sorts of types , from that of the convert who is thrown into unconsciousness by the stress of battling emotions to that of the man who , though truly religious , is conscious of no con-version at all , but seems to have always cared for the best // things . There is not necessarily any sharp line between the converted and the unconverted ; if a child is rightly trained , and grows up into the Christian life , he will need no turning-round . Only those who have become addicted to wrong habits , who have gone so far astray that they have , for the time , lost the power or inclination to follow virtue , need such a right-about-face , such a forcible shaking out of their old ruts and turning to a new direction . Yet conversion has played a large part in Christianity , and rightly so . For to most of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes at some time or other the vision of a higher spiritual level on which we might live ; and even with the best of training the average child is natu-rally self-centered and but slightly , if at all , religious . There comes commonly a moment when the youth or maiden real-izes as never before the meaning of life and its duties , and turns from a hitherto half-unconscious selfishness to a con-scious devotion to the duties which love and religion demand . Professor Starbuck , who , in his valuable Psychology of Reli-gion , has collected many statistics of the various types of conversion , is decided in his affirmation that it is a normal accompaniment of adolescence . The period of the teens is naturally a time of profound mental upheaval , the most critical period of life , when the youth , yet plastic , is forming his character and choosing his ideals . Many primitive reli-gions took advantage of this transition period to awaken the dormant instincts of the young and enlist their loyalty ; the Christian Church should certainly aim to reach and influence them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means true that children are radically and inevitably sinful until a super- // natural grace has transformed them ; in normal cases they should grow imperceptibly into a spontaneous religious life . But that religious life can usually , at the right moments , be greatly stimulated by appropriate suggestion , in forms varying with the individual need . To those who have passed through such a quickening and illuminating experience , it naturally seems important that others should feel it also . And so some Christian churches ? notably the Methodist ? have proclaimed a process of this sort necessary and have refused their fellowship to those who can not profess to have undergone it . Their methods of fostering the experience have become stereotyped ; its particular form in a given church is largely determined by imitation or suggestion . This specific type of experience is then expected of all who are to belong to that church ; and every one in that circle who yearns at all toward religion feels in duty bound to go through this experience , or to persuade himself that he has gone through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this readiness with which a certain measure of conformity is attained , in experiences which appear so individual and spontaneous . But it is generally to be noted that an elaborate and skillful technique has been employed to produce precisely such manifestations ; and they usually occur under the influence of contagion . The danger is , of course , that it degenerate into a perfunctory and mechanical ceremony with the great numbers who are not mentally ready for just that type of experience . But we must never forget that the form without the spirit is worthless ; conversion is not actual unless there is a real change of attitude , a new dedication of the heart , once wavering or indifferent , to the religious life . We are accustomed , perhaps , to associate conversion with revivalistic orgies , with visions and voices , tears and exhortations , and intense emotional stress . In fact , there has been // much of the abnormal , much of the irrational and disgusting , connected with Christian evangelism . But we should not despise methods , however repellent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from sensuality or self ishness to a godly life . The emotional outflows ? shoutings and gesticulations , jerkings , hallelujahs , jumpings up and down , and the like ? are natural enough . To overcome deeprooted habits of wrongdoing and direct a life into new channels may well involve much stress of spirit , be accompanied by deep emotions , and , in those of the proper temperament , by " automatisms " of various sorts ? blinding flashes , luminous figures , voices , and kindred phenomena . Yet it is unfortunate that such abnormal experiences , experiences not accessible to all men , and not always of actual spiritual benefit , should ever have been deemed an essential mark of the Christian life . Christ certainly never required them ; all that he demanded was , " Take up your cross and follow me . " Many of the Christian churches have never encouraged cataclysmic conversion , but have instead elaborated a gradual process of religious education . But the apostle Paul and St. Augustine , perhaps the two men who had the greatest influence in controlling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of psychopathic temperament , subject to these violent experiences ; it is largely due to that fact that catastrophic conversion has seemed to some churches a necessary prelude to the Christian life . From another point of view Christian evangelism has been often disparaged , namely , because its fruits are held to be but transitory , a mere ephemeral burst of emotion that when it ebbs leaves a man no better than before . But very many cases fall within the observation of any student of these phenomena in which the spiritual level has been permanently and strikingly raised as a result of the conversion experience . Backsliders there will be ; and few can hope to // retain through a long succession of common days the vision of their supreme moments . It is impossible to keep the glam-our and the glow that go with " falling in love " through the humdrum years of married life ; yet the radiance of that glo-rious period may bind the two into an eternal union . So the great moments when the soul passionately espouses the reli-gious life should , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the whole subsequent life . And any one who has once known the joy and peace of the Christian spirit , even if for a few days or hours only , can never wholly forget that blessed time , and is forever after more receptive to religious pleading than one who has never , even for a moment , caught the vision of that better Way . Space is lacking for a description of the very various types of the conversion experience . But one great distinction we must note . William James has familiarized us with this distinction , between Volitional Conversion , as he termed it , and Conversion by Self-Surrender . The former type is that of those who attain the new level of life by an agony of struggle and sweat and constantly renewed consecration , who need to retain the militant attitude toward sin . The latter type includes those who best attain the higher life by surrendering themselves at the critical moment to its power . A profound sense of impotence and despair is followed abruptly , in these cases , by a wave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discouragement is often intensified by the lurid preaching of the evangelist , the doctrinal obsession of the natural sinfulness and helplessness of human nature , and the fear of impending punishment ; when the final release comes , the relaxation of pressure and conviction of salvation produces by contrast a keen joy ; the self is no longer divided , the struggle is over . ' This type of mental process produces // obviously the most striking cases ; and some Christian bodies have held it to be the only genuine form of conversion . But , after all , what the particular type of conversion is , matters little ; it is only a question of the most efficacious means to an end . The ultimately important thing is not how a man is converted , but what he is converted to . ' There are dangers in the practice of evangelism . There is the danger of encouraging a mere emotionalism , divorced from sane and accurate thinking ; and of fostering erroneous doctrines through their alliance with such stimulating emo-tions . There is the danger of making the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an altered life . There is the danger of making religion appear something apart from normal life , something violent and absurd and repugnant to people of refinement and common sense . There is the danger of stereotyping the conversion experience till the converts go through it perfunctorily , like so many sheep , as a necessary doorway to the church , without its having a vital meaning to them or being a genuine and organic part of their own life . There is the danger of stimulating an ab-normal craving for excitement , which may satisfy itself upon a later occasion in some disastrous way . There is the danger of neglecting , through reliance upon conversion , the normal processes of religious education . Nevertheless , properly // controlled and directed , the practice of abrupt conversion may be of enormous value ; because it has been misunder-stood and abused , we need by no means utterly discard it ) . The doctrine of the Atonement Through Christ men were saved ; that was the great fact that illuminated the early Christian preaching . The old sacrificial systems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally and forever displaced by the One Saviour . The good news consisted largely in the relief from former burdens . But there was also the positive gospel : somehow by Christ 's life or sacrificial death the power of sin had been broken , and the New Life had been opened up to men . Redemption was an actual experience ? which merged into a greater hope . But what was the objective side to this subjective fact ? How were men saved through Christ ? Paul and the earliest Christian teachers , being al-most exclusively practical in their interests , left the matter open ; there is no definite theory of redemption or atonement in the Bible . But the later theologians found in the rhetoric of these earliest preachers many a suggestion and metaphor that served as scriptural basis for their various theories . ( 1 . ) The earliest theory to obtain wide currency was that of a price paid to the Devil ... That the power of the Evil One had been broken was clear ; and the words " redeem , " " ran-som , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Ireneus and Origen developed , with the relentless logic of the theologian , the apparent implications of these terms . Satan had won , by the successful temptation of Adam , a right to the souls of men ; he held them as his captives . Over Christ , however , because of his sinlessness , he had no power ; // and by causing him to be put to death he made himself in turn liable to a penalty , and had to forfeit his claim over his former prisoners . Christ 's death was , then , a price paid for the souls of men ; the transaction was variously thought of as a bargain , or as a stratagem ; at any rate , the Devil was outwitted p , nd spoiled of his prey . Variant forms of this ransom-theory were formulated by St. Jerome , St. Augustine , St. Bernard , and other pillars of the church ; it has not yet wholly faded from Christian thought . ( 2 ) This dualism , however , this struggle between God and Devil for the souls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the learned doctor Anselm , in answer to his famous question , Cur Deus holm ) ? propounded the legal theory . According to this , the Devil had no rights which God was bound to respect . But the guilt of sin had to be somehow atoned for to maintain God 's honor and satisfy his sense of justice . Christ offered himself , to bear man 's punishment in his stead ; God accepted the substitution ; man can therefore go free . The theory was worked out by Thomas Aquinas , and became the dominant Christian conception . It is embodied by Milton in the lines , ? " Man , ... losing all , To expiate his treason hath naught left , But , to destruction sacred and devote , He with his whole posterity must die ; ? Die he or Justice must ; unless for him Some other , able , and as willing , pay The rigid satisfaction , death for death . " This theory , however , with its picture of God as the stern and relentless judge , was also opposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weakness of its judicial fictions , and it has been pretty widely abandoned by the Church as immoral . That God should insist upon " justice , " i.e. , upon a full measure of punishment for every sin , and be unable or unwilling simply to forgive and forget wrong- // doing , ? which is the result of the instincts and impulses with which men are endowed , and is usually wretched enough in itself , without added punishment , ? has to the sympathetic and sensitive seemed incredible . That prior to Christ 's suf-fering he should have damned poor ignorant men to tor-ments in hell , and should still exact that frightful penalty of them except as they realize their situation and consciously accept Christ 's vicarious sacrifice , is a doctrine too awful for the modern taste . The revenge-conception of punishment has been abandoned in inter-human relations ; and the hu-maner spirit of the times demands an equally humane God . We see too clearly the causes of sin ; we pity the sinner and seek to reform him ; if we imprison him it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring better influences to bear upon him , and to deter others from similar folly . Any punishment beyond what is necessary for these ends is sheer cruelty . Moreover , if God 's relations to men are to be con-ceived in terms of criminal law , if we must at all costs have justice , is it justice to punish myriads of men for Adam 's sin ? even granting that sin to be far more heinous than it would naturally appear ? And what sort of justice is it that could be satisfied with the punishing of one innocent man and the free pardon of myriads of guilty men ? The theory seems a remnant of the ancient idea that the gods need to be placated ; but by the side of the pagan gods , who were con-tent with humble offerings of flesh and fruit , the Christian God , demanding the suffering and death of his own Son , appears a monster of cruelty . ( 3 ) As far back as Abelard , in the twelfth century , the " moral influence theory " had its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , winning its way in the Church . ' // According to it , the power of the death of Christ lay in its awakening in men an answering love powerful enough to conquer their sinfulness . That sacrifice was necessary , not to pay the Devil or to placate God ; it was psychologically necessary , to stir men 's hearts and arouse their latent pow-ers . Christ 's life was saving ; if his death was necessary , it was as a capstone and climax to his life of **25;113;TOOLONG , his teaching failed to win many adherents ; the uttermost sacrifice was needed . And that death on the cross actually proved the saving fact . By it , not by his sinless life , was Paul impressed ; it was the preaching of the cross that converted , that saved , the world . Without pausing to note any of the other , less-known the-ories , we may assert that in this " moral " theory lies what-ever truth there is in the doctrine of the Atonement . Good men do have to atone for the sins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wickedness of men , Christ , our type of spiritual hero , would not have had to suffer and die . That widespread human wickedness cost him dear ; he paid the full price ; and he is the fitting type of the vicariousness of so much of human suffering . Moreover , that suffering , that supreme example of self-sacrificing love , has had a great redeeming power , breaking down men 's resistance and winning them to God . The individual is often unable to cure his own per-verted will ; it is the devoted love of others , such love as is typified in Christ , that softens the hard heart and rescues men from the power of sin . " It is only suffering love that avails to bring back the prodigal sons ; and only as parents // have it for their children , pastors for their people , friends for their friends , can they be real soul-winners. " 1 It is the spirit of Christ , the ministry of love and self-sacrifice , that is slowly lifting men upward ; that event on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process ; the doctrine that has crystallized round it expresses in concrete and tangible form a profound and pathetic truth . But there is always the danger of so preaching this doc-trine as to relax rather than quicken men 's efforts ; contented reliance upon Christ 's sacrifice has led many a Christian to forget that it is only by following Christ , by repeating in his own experience Christ 's sacrifice and victory , that he can share the great reward . Yet this was what Paul meant ; re-demption was to him not an outward transaction but an inward transformation . To Paul 's experience Christianity must cling fast . We must let Christ 's sacrifice touch us , in-clude us , destroy our desire for sin ; we must catch the spirit of atoning love and reenact the great Atonement , in our humble way , in our own lives .
