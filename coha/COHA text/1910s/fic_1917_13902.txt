SCENE  --  The bar of a low dive on the London water front  --  a squalid , dingy room dimly lighted by kerosene lamps placed in brackets on the walls . On the left , the bar . In front of it , a door leading to a side room . On the right , tables with chairs around them . In the rear , a door leading to the street . A slovenly barmaid with a stupid face sodden with drink is mopping off the bar . Her arm moves back and forth mechanically and her eyes are half shut as if she were dozing on her feet . At the far end of the bar stands Fat Joe , the proprietor , a gross bulk of a man with an enormous stomach . His face is red and bloated , his little piggish eyes being almost concealed by rolls of fat . The thick fingers of his big hands are loaded with cheap rings and a gold watch chain of cable-like proportions stretches across his checked waistcoat . At one of the tables , front , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His face is pasty , his mouth weak , his eyes shifting and cruel . He is dressed in a shabby suit , which must have once been cheaply flashy , and wears a muffler and cap . It is about nine o'clock in the evening . FAT JOE  --  ( yawning ) Blimey if bizness ai n't ' arf slow to-night . I donnow wot 's ' appened . The place is like a bleedin ' tomb . Where 's all the sailor men , I 'd like to know ? ( raising his voice ) Ho , you Nick ! ( Nick turns around listlessly . ) Wot 's the name o ' that wessel put in at the dock below jest after noon ? p. 3 NICK  --  ( laconically ) Glencairn  --  from Bewnezerry . ( Buenos Aires ) FAT JOE  --  Ai n't the crew been paid orf yet ? NICK  --  Paid orf this afternoon , they tole me . I ' opped on board of ' er an ' seen ' em .

FAT JOE  --  ( a bit embarrassed ) Well , on'y a bit now an ' agen when there ai n't no reg'lar trade . ( To hide his confusion he turns to the barmaid angrily . She is still mopping off the bar , her chin on her breast , half-asleep . ) ' Ere , me gel , we 've ' ad enough o ' that .

( His shifty eyes peer about the room searchingly . Then he beckons to Joe , who comes over to the table and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drops was ' cause I seen the capt'n of the Amindra this arternoon . FAT JOE  --  The Amindra ? Wot ship is that ? NICK  --  Bloody windjammer  --  skys'l yarder  --  full rigged  --  painted white  --  been layin ' at the dock above ' ere fur a month . You knows ' er . FAT JOE  --  Ho , yus . I knows now . NICK  --  The capt'n says as ' e wants a man special bad  --  ter-night . They sails at daybreak ter-morrer .

Joe gets into position behind the bar , assuming his most oily smile . A moment later the door is opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Driscoll is a tall , powerful Irishman ; Cocky , a wizened runt of a man with a straggling gray mustache ; Ivan , a hulking oaf of a peasant ; Olson , a stocky , middle-aged Swede with round , childish blue eyes . The first three are all very drunk , especially Ivan , who is managing his legs with difficulty . Olson is perfectly sober . All are dressed in their ill-fitting shore clothes and look very uncomfortable . Driscoll has unbuttoned his stiff collar and its ends stick out sideways . He has lost his tie . Nick slinks into the room after them and sits down at a table in rear . The seamen come to the table , front. ) p. 8 FAT JOE  --  ( with affected heartiness ) Ship ahoy , mates ! ' Appy to see yer ' ome safe an ' sound . DRISCOLL  --  ( turns round , swaying a bit , and peers at him across the bar ) So ut 's you , is ut ?

DRISCOLL  --  ( bellowing , and pointing to Nick as Joe brings the drinks to the table ) An ' see what that crimpin ' son av a crimp 'll be wantin '  --  an ' have your own pleasure . ( He pulls a sovereign out of his pocket and slams it on the bar . ) NICK  --  Guv me a pint o ' beer , Joe . ( Joe draws the beer and takes it down to the far end of the bar . Nick comes over to get it and Joe gives him a significant wink and nods toward the door on the left . Nick signals back that he understands . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm that bloody dry !

Olson sips his ginger ale . Nick takes a swallow of his beer and then comes round the bar and goes out the door on left . ) COCKY  --  ( producing a sovereign ) Ho there , you Fatty !

COCKY  --  ( mockingly ) A-saivin ' of ' is money , ' e is ! Goin ' back to ' ome an ' mother . Goin ' to buy a bloomin ' farm an ' punch the blarsted dirt , that 's wot ' e is !

( The only reply to this is a snore . Driscoll pulls the battered remains of the derby off Ivan 's head and smashes it back again . ) Arise an ' shine , ye dhrunken swine ! ( another snore . The women giggle . Driscoll throws the beer left in his glass into Ivan 's face . The Russian comes to in a flash , spluttering . There is a roar of laughter . ) IVAN  --  ( indignantly ) I tell you  --  dot 's someting I don ' li-ike ! COCKY  --  Dow n't waste good beer , Drisc .

( Cocky and Ivan stagger to their feet . Ivan can hardly stand . He is leering at Kate and snickering to himself in a maudlin fashion . The three , led by Nick , go out door on the left . Kate follows them . Olson and Freda , remain seated . ) COCKY  --  ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ollie . OLSON  --  Yes , I come . ( He starts to get up . From the side room comes the sound of an accordion and a boisterous whoop from Driscoll , followed by a heavy stamping of feet . ) FREDA  --  Ow , dow n't go in there .

A moment later Cocky and Driscoll appear , supporting the inert form of Ivan between them . He is in the last stage of intoxication , unable to move a muscle . Nick follows them and sits down at the table in rear . ) DRISCOLL  --  ( as they zigzag up to the bar ) Ut 's dead he is , I 'm thinkin ' , for he 's as limp as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' e ai n't ' arf ' eavy !

( The door to the street is opened and Nick enters , followed by two rough-looking , shabbily-dressed men , wearing mufflers , with caps pulled down over their eyes . They sit at the table nearest to the door . Joe brings them three beers , and there is a whispered consultation , with many glances in the direction of Olson. ) p. 26 OLSON  --  ( starting to get up  --  worriedly ) I tank I go round to boarding house .

( He takes a step forward and suddenly collapses over a chair , rolls to the floor , and lies there unconscious. ) p. 28 FAT JOE  --  ( from behind the bar ) Quick , nawh ! ( Nick darts forward with Joe following . Freda is already beside the unconscious man and has taken the roll of money from his inside pocket . She strips off a note furtively and shoves it into her bosom , trying to conceal her action , but Joe sees her . She hands the roll to Joe , who pockets it . Nick goes through all the other pockets and lays a handful of change on the table . ) FAT JOE  --  ( impatiently ) ' Urry , ' urry , ca n't yer ? The other blokes 'll be ere in ' arf a mo ' .

( He stoops down and fumbles in her bosom and pulls out the banknote , which he stuffs into his pocket with a grunt of satisfaction . Kate opens the door on the left and looks in  --  then rushes to Freda and lifts her head up in her arms . ) KATE  --  ( gently ) Pore dearie ?
