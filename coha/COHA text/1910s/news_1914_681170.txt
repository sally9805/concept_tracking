txt Mexico nor BECKER can drive Mr. MELLEN off the front page . This is so at , a time when the reading public has given signs of weariness with the theorists and perfectionists who , never having built or run railways , are forward with advice upon the subject . Mr. MELLEN 'S stories are entrancing because they are facts , whether liked or disliked . He gives us an inside view of high finance from the standpoint of finance , and not from that of either the gutter or the theorist . He is the practical man of railways , and is as interesting as the practical man of politics , who also is accustomed to the front page whenever he speaks . At the moment it ' can not be denied that blame is on the lips of most , and with reason . There are no apologies to be made for railway finance or operation in the New Haven method  --  looking backward . The results ' are known , and they are not good from any point of view , public or private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. MELLEN or Mr. MORGAN would not do those exact things again , or those things in that exact way . The wreck is useful , nevertheless , however costly in money and what is rarer and more valuable than money . The cost has been paid , and it remains to extract its lesson , for more railways will be wanted some time , and the misadventure in the old method creates the necessity for applying its lesson to bettering it in the new departure . For this purpose it is useful to contrast the actual accomplishments testified to by Mr. MELLEN with the theories , quite generally held and now being testified to before the Federal Industrial Commission , and the practice of the United States , as shown in its laws and conduct . Railways are but a part of the modern industrial structure , and the theorists are sure that its foundation is in the lowest strata of society . Labor in the sense of muscle creates all values . The services of the Mellens and Morgans are to be dispensed with , and their acquirements stripped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all products . There is a portentous literature on the subject , and the theorists are not to be dismissed with sneers . They quarrel with one another , but nevertheless they are influencing our elections and molding our laws . The laws of the Vtlited States are exemplified in the acts of the Interstate Commerce Commission , and in the beginning of the new Alaska railway under the latest enactment of the new method . Its spirit is public service without private profit . There is to be no speculation on the Alaskan railway . The townships are to be laid out before the road is built and the rates are to be fixed without the necessity of meeting fixed charges . When. , the new method also may be judged by its results it will be possible to have fewer doubts about its perfec- ' tions . Will the towns be populated without profits on the lots , and will the traffic move merely because the railway is there ? It is because of the haze surrounding these visions that such interest attaches to Mr. MELLEN 's actualities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the foundation of railway construction , rather than muscle or virtue . He attributes the New Haven 's misfortunes to many things , but chiefly to the loss of its brains . If its master mind had lived the plans which to others seem extravagant in finance , rather wild than bold in conception , and contrary both to public and private interest , would have been worked out to an end beyond the vision of others than those who conceived them and were interrupted in their accomplishment . It is remarkable that this testimony comes from the man nearest , to Mr. MORGAN in this matter , one who has been thought ready to save himself at Mr. MORGAN 'S expense . He rather adds to the already monumental estimate of Mr. MORGAN 's capacity he credits him with the ability for this task . Mr. MELLEN gives not a hint of Mr. MolicAN 's intending anything contrary to the public interest , or with any sordid motive . This theory of the mystery is understandable , even if the Plans themselves can not be accepted as wise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to believe Mr. MELLEN than to accept the more general and the muckraking view that the motives of the scheme were loot and profligacy . The instruction lies rather in the prophecy than in the post-mortem . The New Haven is only an incident in Mr. MORGAN 'S career , and is almost alone in its collapse . Is the country to look forward to more successes in the Morgan manner by other Morgans ? Or is the country to get its railways from the expenditures of tax moneys by those who neither have earned the capital nor can profit from the results ? Or are railways hereafter to be built entirely by the brawn which levels the route and spikes the rails to the ties ? Can the country dispense with brains and capital motived by profit and rely upon its muscle and patriotism for its railways ? Either the old ' methods ' or the . new methods must prevail ; and this testimony makes it necessary to choose between them .                  @ @ @
