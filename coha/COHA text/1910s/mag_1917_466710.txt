To Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes , in Boston : DEAR DR . HOLMES , ? I shall never be able to tell you the half of how proud you have made me . If I could you would say you were nearly paid for the trouble you took . And then the family : if I can convey the electrical surprise and gratitude and exalta ? tion of the wife and the children last night , when they happened upon that Critic where I had , with artful artlessness , spread it open and retired out of view to see what would happen ? well , it was great and fine and beau CXXXV. ? No. 808. - 72tiful to see , and made me feel as the victor feels when the shouting hosts march by ; and if you also could have seen it you would have said the account was squared . For I have brought them up in your company , as in the company of a warm and friendly and beneficent but far-distant sun ; and so , for you to do this thing was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the miracle of a special ray and transfigure me before their faces . I knew what that poem would be to them ; I knew it would raise me up to remote and shining heights in their eyes , to very fellow ? ship with the Chambered Nautilus itself , and that from that fellowship they could never more dissociate me while they should live ; and so I made sure to be by when the sur ? prise should come . Charles Dudley Warner is charmed with the poem for its own felicitous sake ; and indeed ndeed am I , but more because it has drawn the sting of my fiftieth year ; taken away the pain of it , the grief of it , the some ? how shame of it , and made me glad and proud it happened . With reverence and affection , Sincerely yours , S. L. CLEMENS .

I hope you and Pilla can take a train that arrives here during the day ; the one that leaves Boston toward the end of the afternoon would be a trifle late ; the per ? formance would have already begun when you reached the house . I 'm out of the woods . On the last day of the year I had paid out $r82,000 on the Grant book and it was totally free from debt . Yrs ever MARK .. Mark Twain 's mother was a woman of sturdy fiber , possessing a keen sense of humor and tender sympathies . Her husband , John Marshall Clemens , had been a man of high moral character , honored by all who knew him , respected and apparently loved by his wife . No one would ever have supposed that dur ? ing all her years of marriage , and almost to her death , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told at last in the weary disappointment of old age . It is a curious story , and it came to light in this curious way . To William Dean Howells , in Boston : HARTFORD . May 19. ' 86 . MY DEAR How . . Here 's a secret . A most curious and pathetic romance , which has just come to light . Read these things , but do n't mention them . Last fall , my old mother ? then 8z tooka notion to attend a convention of old settlers of the Mississippi Valley in an Iowa town . My brother 's wife was astonished ; and represented to her the hardships and fatigues of such a trip , and said my mother might possibly not even survive them ; and said there could be no possible interest for her in such a meeting and such a crowd . But my mother insisted , and persisted ; and finally gained her point . They started ; and all the way my mother was yourig again with excitement , interest , eager ? ness , anticipation . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the same eagerness in her eye and her step , to the counter , and said : " Is Dr. Barrett of St. Louis here ? " " No . He was here , but he returned to St. Louis this morning . " " Will he come again ? " " No . " My mother turned away , the fire all gone from her , and said , " Let us go home . " They went straight back to Keokuk . My mother sat silent and thinking for many days ? a thing which had never happened before . Then one day she said : " I will tell you a secret . When I was eighteen , a young medical student named Barrett lived in Columbia ( Ky. ) , eighteen miles away ; and he used to ride over to see me . This continued for some time . I loved him with my whole heart , and I knew that he felt the same toward me , though no words had been spoken . He was too bashful to speak ? he could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? took it for granted we were -- -but we were not . By and by there was to be a party in a neighboring town , and he wrote my uncle telling him his feelings , and asking him to drive me over in his buggy and let him ( Barrett ) drive me back , so that he might have that opportunity to propose . My uncle should have done as he was asked , without explaining anything to me ; but instead , he read me the letter ; and then , of course , I could not go ? and did not . He ( Barrett ) left the country presently , and I , to stop the clacking tongues , and to show him that I did not care , married , in a pet . In all these sixty-four years I have not seen him since . I saw in a paper that he was going to attend that Old Settlers ' Conven ? tion . Only three hours before we reached that hotel , he had been standing there ! " Since then , her memory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writes letters to the schoolmates who have been dead forty years , and wonders why they neglect her and do not answer . Think of her carrying that pathetic burden in her old heart sixty-four years , and no hu ? man being ever suspecting it ! Yrs ever , MARK . We do not get the idea from this letter that those two long-ago sweethearts quarreled , but Mark Twain once spoke of them having done so , and there may have been a disagreement , assuming that there was a subsequent meeting . It does not matter , now . In speaking of it Mark Twain once said , " It is as pathetic a romance as any that has crossed the field of my personal experi ? ence in a long lifetime . " ' Howells wrote : After all , how poor and hackneyed all the inventions are compared with the simple and stately facts . Who could have imagined such a heartbreak as that ? Yet it went along with the fulfilment of every-day duty , and made no more noise than a grave underfoot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such things . Jane Clemens now lived with her son Orion and his wife in Keokuk , where she was more contented than elsewhere . In these later days her memory had be ? come erratic , her realization of passing events uncertain , but there were times when she was quite her former self , remembering clearly and talking with her old-time gaiety of spirit . Mark Twain frequently sent herplayful let- ters , to cheer her , letters full of such boyish gaiety as had amused her long ' When Mark Twain : 1 Biography was written this letter had not come to light , and the matter was stated there in accordance with Mark Twain 's latest memory of it , years before . The one that follows is a fair example . It was written after a visit which Clemens and his family had paid to Keokuk . To Jane Clemens , in Keokuk : ELMIRA , Avg. 7 , ' 85 . DEAR heard that Molly and Orion and Pamela had been sick , but I see by your letter that they arc much better now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month ago , it seemed to us that your Keokuk weather was pretty hot ; Jean and Clara sat up in bed at Mrs. McElroy 's and cried about it , and so did I ; but I judge by your letter that it has cooled down , now , so that a person is comparatively comfortable with his skin off . Well it did need cooling ; I remem ? ber that I burnt a hole in my shirt , there , with some ice-cream that fell on it ; and Miss Jenkins told me they never used a stove , but cooked their meals on a marble-topped table in the drawing-room , just with the natural heat . If anybody else had told me , I would not have believed it . I was told by the Bishop of Keokuk that he did not allow crying at funerals , because it scalded the furniture . if Miss Jenkins had told me that , I would have believed it . This reminds me that you speak of Dr. Jenkins and his family as if they were strangers to me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember gratefully how tender the doctor was with Jean when she hurt her arm , and how quickly he got the pain out of the hurt , whereas I sup ? posed it was going to last at least an hour ? No , I do n't forget some things as easily as 1 do others . Yes , it was pretty hot weather . Now here , when a person is going to die , he is always in a sweat about where he is going to ; but in Keokuk of course they do n't rare , because they are fixed for anything . It has set me reflecting , it has taught me a lesson . By and by , when my health fails , I am going to put all my affairs in order , and bid good-bye to my friends here , and kill all the people I do n't like , and go out to Keokuk and prepare for death . They are all well in this family , and we all send love . Affly Your Son SAM . The ways of city officials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mark Twain sometimes found it neces ? sary , to write picturesque letters of pro ? test . The following to a Hartford lght ? ing company is a fair example of these documents . To a Gas &; Electric Lighting Co. , in Hartford : GENTLEMEN , ? There are but two places in our whole street where lights could be of any value , by any accident , and you have measured and appointed your intervals so ingeniously as to leave each of those places in the centre of a couple of hundred yards of solid darkness . When I noticed that you were setting one of your lights in such a way that I could almost see how to get into my gate at night , I suspected that it was a piece of carelessness on the part of the workmen , and would be corrected as soon as you should go around inspecting and find it out . My judgment was right ; it is always right , where you are concerned . For fifteen years , in spite of my prayers and tears , you persistently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that I could n't find either of them after dark ; and then furnished such execrable gas that I had to hang a danger signal on the lamp-post to keep teams from running into it , nights . Now I suppose your present idea is , to leave us a little more in the dark . Do n't mind us ? out our way ; we possess but one vote apiece , and no rights which you are in any way bound to respect . Please take our electric light and go to ? but never mind , it is not for me to suggest ; you will probably find the way ; and anyway you can reason ? ably count on divine assistance if you lose your bearings . S. L. CLEMENS . Frequently Clemens did not send let ? ters of this sort after they were written . Sometimes he realized the uselessness of such protest ; sometimes the mere writ ? ing of them had furnished the necessary relief , and he put the letter away , or into the waste-basket , and wrote something more temperate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the manager of a traveling theatrical company wrote that he had taken the liberty of drama ? tizing Tom Sawyer , and would like also the use of the author 's name ? the idea being to convey to the public that it was a Mark Twain play . In return for this slight favor the manager invited Clemens to come and see the play ? to be present at the opening night as it were , at his ( the manager 's ) expense . He added that if the play should be a " go " in the cities , . there might he some " ar ? rangement " of profits . Apparently these inducements did not appeal to Mark ' Twain. he long , unmailed reply is the more interesting , but probably the briefer one that follows it was quite effective . UNMAILED ANSWER HARTVORD . SePI. 8. ' 87 . DEAR SIR , ? And so it has got around to you , at last ; and you also have " taken the liberty . " You are No. 1365 . When 1364 sweeter and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " to dramatize Tom Sawyer and did not arrive , what sort of show do you suppose you stand ? That is a book , dear sir , which can not be dramatized . One might as well try to dramatize any other hymn . Tom Sawyer is simply a hymn , put Into prose form to give it a worldly air . Why the pale doubt that flitteth dim and nebulous athwart the forecastle of your third sentence ? Have no fears . Your piece will be a Go . It will go out the back door the first night . They 've all done it ? the 1364 . So will you-1365 . Not one of us ever thought of the simple device of half-soling himself with a stove-lid . Ah , what suffering a little hindsight would have saved us . Treasure this hint . How kind of you to invite me to the fu ? neral . Go to ; I have attended a thousand of them . I have seen Tom Sawyer 's remains in all the different kinds of dramatic shrouds there are . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you propose to pay my expence ? if that is the Susquehannian way of spelling it ? And can you be aware that I charge a hundred dollars a mile when I travel for pleasure ? Do you realize that it is 432 miles to Susquehanna ? Would it be handy for you to send me the $43,200 first , so I could be counting it as I come along ; because railroading is pretty dreary to a sensitive nature when there 's nothing sor ? did to buck at for Zeitvertreib . Now as I understand it , dear and magnani ? mous 1365 , you are going to re-create Tom Sawyer dramatically , and then do me the compliment to put me in the bills as father of this shady offspring . Sir , do you know that that kind of a compliment has destroyed people before now ? Listen . Twenty-four years ago , I was strangely handsome . The remains of it are still visible through the rifts of time . I was so hand ? some that human activities ceased as if spell ? bound when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things stopped to look ? like locomo ? tives , and district messenger-boys and so on . In San Francisco , in the rainy season I was often mistaken for fair weather . Upon one occasion I was traveling in the Sonora region , and stopped for an hour 's nooning , to rest my horse and myself . All the town came out to look . The tribes of Indians gathered to look . A Piute squaw named her baby for me , ? a voluntary compliment whichpleased me greatly . Other attentions were paid me . Last of all arrived the president and faculty of Sonora University and offered ' me the post of Professor of Moral Culture and the Dogmatic Humanities ; which I ac ? cepted gratefully , and entered at once upon my duties . But my name had pleased the Indians , and in the deadly kindness of their hearts they went on naming their babies after me . I tried to stop it , but the Indians could not understand why I should object to so manifest a compliment . The thing grew and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The University stood it a couple of years ; but then for the sake of the college they felt obliged to call a halt , although I had the sympathy of the whole faculty . The president himself said to me , " I am as sorry as I can be for you , and would still hold out if there were any hope ahead ; but you see how it is : there are a hundred and thirty-two of them already , and fourteen precincts to hear from . The circumstance has brought your name into most wide and unfortunate renown . It causes much comment ? I believe that that is not an over-statement . Some of this com ? ment is palliative , but some of it ? by patrons at a distance , who only know the statistics without the explanation , ? is offensive , and in some rases even violent . Nine students have been called home . The trustees of the college have been growing more and more uneasy all these last months ? steadily along with the implacable increase in your census ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once they have touched upon the ex ? pediency of a change in the Professorship of Moral Culture . The coarsely sarcastic edi ? torial in yesterday 's rota , ? headed Give the Moral Acrobat a Rest ? has brought things to a crisis , and I am charged with the un ? pleasant duty of receiving your resignation . " I know you only mean me a kindness , dear 1365 , but it is a most deadly mistake . Please do not name your Injun for me . . Truly Yours . MAILED ANSWER NEW YORK , . Sept. 8 , 1887 . DEAR Sia , ? Necessarily I can not assent to so strange a proposition . And I think it but fair to warn you that if you put the piece on the stage , you must take the legal conse ? consequences . Mark Twain once remarked , " The symbol of the human race ought to be an ax ; every human being has concealed somewhere about his person one which he wishes to grind . " He declared that when a stranger called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases out of ten he could distinguish almost immediately the gleam of the ax . The following letter was of a type sent not once , but many times , in some form adapted to the specific applicant . It does not matter to whom it was originally written , the name would not be recognized . To Mrs. T. ? Concerning ' unearned credentials , etc. : HARTFORD , 1887 . MY DEAR MADAM , It is an idea which many people have had , but it is of no value . I have seen it tried many and many a time . I have seen a lady lecturer urged and urged upon the public in a lavishly complimentary document signed by Longfellow , Whittier , Holmes and some others of supreme celeb ? rity , but ? there was nothing in her and she failed . If there had been any great merit in her she never would have needed those men 's help and ( at her rather mature age ) would never have consented to ask for it . There is an unwritten law about human successes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she must submit to its requirements . In brief this law is : t . No occupation without an apprentice ? ship . z . No pay to the apprentice . This law stands right in the way of the subaltern who wants to be a General before he has smelt powder ; and it stands ( and should stand ) in everybody 's way who ap ? plies for pay or position before he has served his apprenticeship and proved himself . Your sister 's course is perfectly plain . Let her enclose this letter to Maj. J. B. Pond , and offer to lecture a year for $io a week and her expenses , the contract to be annullable by him at any time , after a rnernth 's notice , but not annullable by her at all . The second year , he to have her services , if he wants them , at a trifle under the best price offered her by anybody else She can learn her trade in those two years , and then be entitled to remuneration ? but she can not learn it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a human miracle . Try it , and do not be afraid . It is the fair and right thing . If she wins , she will win squarely and righteously , and never have to blush . Truly yours , S. L. CLEMENS . Our next letter is an unmailed an ? swer , but it does not belong with the foregoing , having been withheld for rea ? sons of quite a different sort . Jeannette Gilder , then of the Critic , was one of Mark Twain 's valued friends . In thecomment which he made , when it was shown to him twenty-two years later , he tells us why he thinks this letter was not sent . HARTFORD , May 14 , ' 87 . MY DEAR MISS GILDER ,  - -  - We shall spend the summer at the same old place ? the re ? mote farm called " Rest-and-be-Thankful , " on top of the hills three miles from Elmira , N. Y. Your other question is harder to answer . It is my habit to keep four or five books in process of erection all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bricks to two or three of them ; but I can not fore ? cast which of the two or three it is going to be . It takes seven years to complete a book by this method , but still it is a good method : gives the public a rest . I have been accused of " rushing into print " prematurely , moved thereto by greediness for money ; but in truth 1 have never done that . Do you care for trifles of information ? Well , then , Tom Sawyer and The Prince and the Pauper were each on the stocks two or three years , and Old Times on the Mississippi eight . One of my unfinished hooks has been on the stocks sixteen years ; another seventeen . This latter book could have been finished in a day , at any time during the past five years . But as in the first of these two narratives all the action takes place in Noah 's ark , and as in the other the action takes place in heaven , there seemed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tales of stirring adventure in those localities do not need to be rushed to publication lest they get stale by waiting . In twenty-one years , with all my time at my free disposal I have written and completed only eleven books , whereas with half the labor that a journalist does I could have written sixty in that time . I do not greatly mind being accused of a proclivity for nishing into print , but at the same time I do n't believe that the charge is really well founded . Suppose I did write eleven books , have you nothing to be grateful for ? Go to ? remem ? ber the forty-nine which I did n't write . Truly Yours S. L. CLEMENS . . NOTES ( ADDED TWENTY-TWO YEARS LATER ) STORMFIELD , April 30 , No9. ? It seems the letter was not sent . I probably feared she might print it , and I could n't find a way to say so without running a risk of hurting her . No one would hurt Jeannette Gilder pur ? posely , and no one would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She is my neighbor , six miles away , now , and I must ask her about this ancient letter . I note with pride and pleasure that I told no untruths in my unsent answer . I still have the habit of keeping unfinished books lying around years and years , waiting . I have four or five novels on hand at present in a half-finished condition , and it is more than three years since I have looked at any of them . I have no intention of finishing them . I could complete all of them in less than a year , if the impulse should come powerfully upon rne . Long , long ago money-necessity furnished that impulse once ( Fol ? lowing the Equator ) , but mere desire for money has never furnished it , so far as I remember . Not even money-necessity was able to overcome me on a couple of occa ? sions when perhaps I ought to have allowed it to succeed . While 1 was a bankrupt and in debt two offers were made me for weekly literary contributions to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a debtless man of me , but I declined them , with my wife 's full approval , for I had known of no instance where a man had pumped himself out once a week and failed to run " empty ? ings " before the year was finished . As to that " Noah 's Ark " book , I began it in Edinburgh in 1873 ; 1 I do n't know where the manuscript is , now . It was a Diary , which professed to be the work of Shem , but was n't . I began it again several months ago , but only for recreation ; I had n't any inten ? tion of carrying it to a finish ? or even to the end of the first chapter , in fact . As to the book whose action " takes place in Heaven . " That was a small thing ( Cap ? tain Stormfield 's Visit to Heaven ) . It lay in my pigeon-holes 10 years , then I took it out and printed it in Harper 's Atonally last year . S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to absent-mindedness . He was al ? ways forgetting engagements , or getting them wrong . Once he hurried to an afternoon party and , finding the mistress of the house alone , at down and talked to her comfortably for an hour or two , not remembering his errand at all . It was only when he reached home that he learned that the party had taken place the week before . It was always dan ? gerous for him to make engagements , and he never seemed to profit by sorrow ? ful experience . We , however , may profit now by one of his amusing apologies . To Mrs. Grover Cleveland , in Wash ? ington : ours whenever the minor half of the admin ? istration tries to run itself without the help of the major half it gets aground . Last night when I was offered the opportunity to assist you in the throwing open the Warner brothers ' superb benefaction in Bridgeport to those fortunate women , I naturally appre ? ciated the honor done me , and promptly seized my chance . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my mind . If I had only laid the matter before the major half of the administration on the spot , there would have been no blunder ; but I never thought of that . So when I did lay it before her , later , I realized once more that it will not do for the literary fraction of a combina ? tion to try to manage affairs which properly belong in the office of the business bulk of it . I suppose the President often acts just like that : goes and makes an impossible promise , and you never find it out until it is next to impossible to break it up and set things straight again . Well , that is just our way , exactly ? one half of the administration al ? ways busy getting the family into trouble , and the other half busy getting it out again . And so we do seem to be all pretty much alike , after all . The fact is , I had forgotten that we were to have a dinner party on that Bridgeport date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a good deal of an improvement for me , because I am more used to being behind a day or two than ahead . But that is just the difference between one end of this kind of an administration and the other end of it , as you have noticed , yourself ? the other end does not forget these things . Just so with a funeral ; if it is the man 's funeral , he is most always there , of course ? hut that is no credit to him , he would n't be there if you depended on him to remember about it ; whereas , if on the other hand ? but I seem to have got off froni my line of argument some ? how ; never mind about the funeral . Of course I am not meaning to say anything against funerals ? that is , as occasions ? mere occasions ? for as diversions I do n't think they amount to much . But as I was saying ? if you are not busy I will look back and see what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find the place ; but any ? way she was as sorry as ever anybody could be that I could not go to Bridgeport , but there was no help for it . And I , 1 have been not only sorry but very sincerely ashamed of having made an engagement to go without first making sure that I could keep it , and I do not know how to apologize enough for my heedless breach of good manners . With the sincerest respect , S. L. CLEMENS . Clemens received his first college de ? gree when he was made Master of Arts by Yale , in June , i888 . Editor of the Courant , Charles H. Clarke , was selected to notify him of his new title . Clarke was an old friend to whom Clemens could write familiarly . To Charles H. Clarke , in Hartford : ELMIRA , July 2 , ' 88 . MY DEAR CHARLES , ? Thanks for your thanks , and fcl'r your initiation intentions . I shall be ready for you . I feel mighty proud of that degree ; in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and say vain of it . And why should n't I be ? ? I am the only literary animal of my particular subspecies who has ever been given a degree by any College in any age of the world , as far as I know . Sincerely Yours S. A. CLEMENS , M.A. Reply ? Charles H. Clarke to S. L. Clemens : ' MY DEAR FRIEND , You are " the only literary animal of your particular sub ? species " in existence and you 've no cause for humility in the fact . Yale has done herself at least as much credit as she has done you , and " Do n't you forget it . " C. H. C. Mark Twain that year ( 1888 ) was working pretty steadily on the Yankee at King Arthur 's Court , a book which he had begun two years before . He had published nothing since the Huck Finn story , and his company was badly in need of a new book by an author of dis ? tinction . Also it was highly desirable to earn money for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yankee . story . He had worked pretty steadily that sum ? mer in his Elmira study , but on his re ? turn to Hartford he found a good deal of confusion in the house , so he went over to his friend " Joe " Twichell 's , where carpentering was in progress . He seems to have worked there successfully , though what improvement of conditions he found in that numerous , lively house ? hold over those at home it would be difficult to say . To Theodore W. Crane , at Quarry Farm , Elmira , N. Y. : EummA . N. Y. , Friday , 00 . S. ' 88 . DEAR TnEo , ? I am here in Twichell 's house , at work , with the noise of the children and an army of carpenters to help . Of course they do n't help , but neither do they hinder . It 's like a boiler-factory for racket , and in nailing a wooden ceiling onto the room under me the hammering tickles my feet amazingly sometimes , and jars my table a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ racket at all , and I move my feet into posi ? tion of relief without knowing when I do it . I began here Monday morning , and have done eighty pages since . I was so tired last night that I thought I would lie abed and rest , to-day ; but 1 could n't resist . I mean to try to knock off to-morrow , but it 's doubt ? ful if I do . I want to finish the day the ma ? chine finishes , and a week ago the closest calculations for that indicated Oct. 22 ? but experience teaches me that their calcu ? lations will miss fire , as usual . The other day the children were projecting a purchase , Livy and I to furnish the money ? a dollar and a half . Jean discouraged the idea . She said : " We have n't got any money . Children , if you would think , you would remember the machine is n't done . It 's billiards to-night . I wish you were here . With love to you both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was n't the children , it was Marie . She wanted a box of blacking , for the children 's shoes . Jean reproved her ? and said : " Why , Marie , you must n't ask for things now . The machine is n't done . " S. L. C. The " machine " was the Paige type ? setter in which Clemens invested , and lost , a large fortune . The Yankee story was finished in due time and ready for the printer . The book did not find a very hearty welcome in England . English readers did not fancy any burlesque of their Arthurian tales , or American strictures on their institutions . Mark Twain 's publishers had feared this , and asked that the story be specially edited for the English edition . Clemens , however , would not hear to any suggestions of the sort . To Messrs Chau ? &; Windus , Lon ? don , Eng. : GENTLEMEN , ? Concerning the Yankee , I have already revised the story twice ; and it has been read critically by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife has caused me to strike out several pas ? sages that have been brought to her atten ? tion , and to soften others . Furthermore I have read chapters of the book in public where Englishmen were present and have profited by their suggestions . Now , mind you , I have taken all this pains because I wanted to say a Yankee mechan ? ic 's say against monarchy and its several natural props , and yet make a book which you would be willing to print exactly as it comes to you , without altering a word . We are spoken of ( by Englishmen ) as a thin-skinned people . It is you who are thin-skinned . An Englishman may write with the most brutal frankness about any man or institution among us and we re-publish him without dreaming of altering a line or a word . But England can not stand that kind of a book written about herself . It is England that is thin-skinned . It causeth me to smile when I read the modifications of my language which have been made in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palate . Now , as I say , I have taken laborious pains to so trim this book of offense that you 'll not lack the nerve to print it just as it stands . I am going to get the proofs to you just as early as I can . I want you to read it carefully . If you can publish it without altering a single word , go ahead . Otherwise , please hand it to J. R. Osgood in time for him to have it published at my expense . This is important , for the reason that the book was not written for America ; it was written for England . So many Englishmen have done their sincerest best to teach us something for our betterment that it seems to me high time that some of us should substantially recognize the good intent by trying to pry up the English nation to a little higher level of manhood in turn . Very truly yours , S. L. CLEMENS . The English nation , at least a consid ? erable portion of it , did not wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manhood " by a Connecticut Yankee . The papers pretty generally denounced the book as coarse ? in fact , a vulgar travesty . Some of the critics concluded that England , after all , had made a mistake in admiring Mark Twain . Clemens stood this for a time and then seems to have decided that something ought to be done . One of the foremost of English critics was his friend and admirer ; he would state the case to him fully , and invite his assistance . To Andrew Lang , in London , 1889 : First page missing . the head tells you pretty promptly whether the food is satisfactory or not ; and everybody hears , and thinks the whole man has spoken . it is a delusion . Only his taste and his smell have been heard from ? im ? portant , both , in a way , but these do not build up the man , and preserve his life and fortify it . The little child is permitted to label its drawings " This is a cow ? this is a horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It saves it from the sorrow and wrong , of hearing its cows and horses criticized as kangaroos and work-benches . A man who is white-washing a fence is doing a useful thing , so also is the man who is adorning a rich man 's house with costly frescoes ; and all of us are sane enough to judge these performances by standards proper to each . Now , then , to be fair , an author ought to be allowed to put upon his book an explanatory line : " This is written for the Head ; " " This is written for the Belly and the Members . " And the critic ought to hold himself in honor bound to put away from him his ancient habit of judging all books by one standard , and thenceforth follow a fairer course . The critic assumes , every time , that if a book does n't meet the cultivated-class stand ? ard , it is n't valuable . Let us apply his law all around : for if it is sound in the case of novels , narratives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound and applicable to all the steps which lead up to culture and make culture possible . It condemns the spelling-book , for a spelling-book is of no use to a person of culture ; it condemns all school ? books and all schools which lie between the child 's primer and Greek , and between the infant school and the university ; it con ? demns all the rounds of art which lie between the cheap terra-cotta groups and the Venus de Medici , and between the chromo and the Transfiguration ; it requires Whitcomb Riley to sing no more till he can sing like Shake ? speare , and it forbids all amateur music and will grant its sanction to nothing below the " classic . " Is this an extravagant statement ? No , it is a mere statement of fact . It is the fact itself that is extravagant and grotesque . And what is the result ? This andit is sufficiently curious : the critic has actually imposed upon the world.the superstition that a painting by Raphael is more valuable to the civilizations of the earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hurdy-gurdy and the villagers ' singing society ; and Homer than the little everybody 's poet whose rhymes are in all mouths to-day and will be in nobody 's mouth next generation ; and the Latin classics than Kipling 's far-reaching bugle-note ; and Jonathan Edwards than the Salvation Army ; and the Venus de Medici than the plaster-cast peddler ; the supersti ? tion , in a word , that the vast and awful comet that trails its cold lustre through the remote abysses of space once a century and interests and instructs a cultivated handful of astronomers is worth more to the world than the sun which warms and cheers all the nations every day and makes the crops to grow . If a critic should start a religion it would not have any object but to convert angels : and they would n't need it . The thin top crust of humanity ? the cultivated ? are worth pacifying , worth pleasing , worth coddling , worth nourishing and preserving with dainties and delicacies , it is true ; but to be caterer to that little faction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me ; it is merely feeding the overfed , and there must be small satisfaction in that . It is not that little minority who are already saved that arc best worth lifting up , I should think , but the mighty mass of the unculti ? vated who are underneath . That mass will never see the Old Masters ? that sight is for the few ; but the chromo-maker can lift them all one step upward toward appreciation of art ; they can not have the opera , but the hurdy-gurdy and the singing class lift them a little way toward that far light ; they will never know Homer , but the passing rhyme ? ster of their day leaves them higher than he found them ; they may never even hear of the Latin classics , but they will strike step with Kipling 's drum-beat , and they will march ; for all Jonathan Edwards 's help they would die in their slums , but the Salva ? tion Army will beguile some of them up to pure air and a cleaner life ; they know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them , but they are a grade higher in the scale of civilization by the ministrations of the plaster cast than they were before it took its place upon their mantel and made it beautiful to their unexpected eyes . Indeed I have been misjudged , from the very first I have never tried in even one single little instance , to help cultivate the cultivated classes . I was not equipped for it , either by native gifts or training . And I never had any ambition in that direction , butalways hunted for bigger game ? the masses . I have seldom deliberately tried to instruct them , but have done my best to entertain them . To simply amuse them would have satisfied my dearest ambition at any time ; for they could get instruction elsewhere , and I had two chances to help to the teacher 's one : for amusement is a good preparation for study and a good healer of fatigue after it . My audience is dumb , it has no voice in print , and so I can not know whether I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , you see , I have always catered for the Belly and the Members , but have been served like the others ? criticized from the culture-standard ? to my sorrow and pain ; because , honestly , I never cared what be ? came of the cultured classes ; they could go to the theatre and the opera , they had no use for me and the melodeon . And now at last I arrive at my object and tender my petition , making supplication to this effect : that the critics adopt a rule recognizing the Belly and the Members , and formulate a standard whereby work done for them shall be judged . Help me , Mr. Lang ; no voice can reach further than yours in a case of this kind , or carry greater weight of authority . Lang 's reply was an article in the Illustrated London News on " The Art of Mark Twain . " Lang had no admiration to express for the Yankee , which he confessed he had not cared to read , but he glorified Huck Finn to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the exquisite pleasure with which I read Huckleberry Finn for the first time , years ago , " he wrote . " I read it again last night , deserting Kenilworth for Huck . I never laid it down till I had finished it . " Lang closed his article by referring to the story of Huck as the " great Amer ? ican novel which had escaped the eyes of those who watched to see this new planet swim into their ken .
