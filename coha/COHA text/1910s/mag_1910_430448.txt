EVERYTHING and everybody that comes to Tangier from Europe or goes out must pass by the Socco Chico ? which is to say little market . The Socco Chico is no market ? merely a widening of the narrow street which is the greatest thoroughfare of Tangier , and through which , like a tumultuous torrent , rushes all the traffic of Europe to Morocco and Morocco to Europe . If you are a foot-passenger in this street , you feel as though you were borne along on an unruly stream at its flood . In front of you as you look up the hill is a multitude of bobbing turbaned heads whose mouths shout perpetually . There are crates , barrels , European tables and chairs , sacks of flour , the wreckage of a town apparently , together with its inhabitants , carried along on the surface  |p813  of unquiet waters . In reality the barrels and crates are swaying perilously on the backs of unscrupulous donkeys who do not hesitate to run clown a bewildered European . No one to regulate traffic ; no laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buffeted by the crowd , bewildered by the strange noises , you find yourself in the Sacco Chico , and , a little stunned , you rest yourself outside a cafe . There you realize that the torrent is in reality a disordered procession , a confused pageant , in which all the peoples of Morocco file before ypu fantastically , pic-turesque , sometimes beautiful . There are groups of Moors in spotless white , paleyellow slippers on their feet ; beggars ; children sitting on the extreme stern-sheets of donkeys ; now and then one of the inspiring sights of the world , a clean-cut Arab on a beautiful Arab horse , his saddle crimson , his white burnoose falling about him in lovely folds ? serene and scornful men these , unconscious of the crowd around them . There are Arabs on mules , Riffs driving donkeys , veiled and barelegged women , their brilliantly dressed babies slung on their backs . One would seem to be looking at something which happened long ago , were it . not for the occasional Europeans . They did not look well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfinished and gross ? gross and bloated , angry and discontented . Nor is it the dignified costume in contrast to European dress which caused this . There is a finecut , ascetic quality without austerity in the faces of Moorish men , townsmen and country people alike . The Moor never has the loutish aspect of the European peasant ; he walks like a freeman , his eyes are clear . Economic pressure has not yet laid its relentless hand on the people of Morocco . Among the higher classes there are many with great sweetness of expression , the s a m e quality which one sees on the faces of good worsen or on the faces of happy mothers of little children at home . They grow old with dignity and beauty . T h e contrast between them and us is so marked ? and from the time one leaves Gibraltar all Europeans become us ? that one must ask one 's self what is it that they have in their civilization which we lack . Is it only that we eat and drink t o o @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which we have not ? And there it is that we find ourselves face to face with one of the riddles that the East is forever putting to the unquiet spirit of the West . Perhaps it is this mystery that makes the East lay so heavy a hand upon so many of us ; why tourists , come for a week , die after many years in Morocco . And why so many of us who go back home carry with us a nostalgia for a country where we must forever remain outsiders . We come back to the comprehensible , to long ever more to go back to the in/ comprehensible . Here we only know that these dark men think as we do n't , and the mystery beckons . And we , like curious , restless children , mint always be standing on tiptoe to try again for the key of the door which we know so well is out of reach . We must try again to look over the forbidden wall , and though we fail forever , we feel always as if tomorrow understanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of discovery . When one of us tries to write about Morocco , lie can but give a series of pictures of whose meaning he is ignorant , describe the thing seen without being able to tell if what he describes is significant or not . Writing of Morocco is like tracing a sentence in Arabic ; in aspect the script is intricate and beautiful , but you do not know the meaning . It may mean nothing more esoteric than that trees have leaves , and you may have been fooled into a belief of deep-lying mystery by the unfamiliar aspect of the letters ? but while you may learn the meaning of the Arabic characters , who can tell you what is written on the faces of the men and women ? As we teased ourselves with these questions , one familiar thing started out of the baffling and unfamiliar crowd . It was a boy ? a common , or garden , boy ; though a plum - colored djellab flapped around his bare legs in picturesque lines until he looked like a figure in a fantastic pantomime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in black gabardine , black skull-cap , chased him , saving things . The boy , as he ran , turned and made faces ; also he stuck out a derisive tongue . He also shouted replies . One understood these replies too well to wish to understand more . There was nothing abstruse or Oriental about that boy ; he was an intelligent street gamin of the purest type . He dodged the enemy neatly , and a friend joined him in a flank attack , and then another and another . There was no doubt about it . It was " de yang . " It made no difference that they were dressed as for carnival , that they were of all shades and types , from straightfeatured Arab lads to a black devil who looked as though he had come yesterday from Virginia ? it was " de gang " just the same , raising the same kind of lark that you may see them raising on Christopher Street any day when there 's no plain-clothes man in sight . The Jew disposed of , they spotted us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled out cigarettes from the big leather pouch that every male Moor wears by way of pocket . With grins they pestered the stranger for pennies , wheedled cigarettes from Lim , and pointed out gayly to the beggars of Tangier that a new bunch of Easy Marks had struck town . It was a brave and soul-comforting spectacle . It was a fact to cling to , in this strange and unfamiliar country , that left to himself  |p816  the human boy is pretty much the same all the world over . If one could get hold of a boy , one would have with one something one could understand ? a clue to follow out into all this mystery . But even the boy turned on us ? and there you have one of the favorite tricks of the East ; just as you think you have gotten hold of something sure , it turns out you are holding illusion . In the crowd there stood a black , black man ? a holy man , madman , beggar , we could not tell ? gazing at its from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . He was meagre in body . Asceticism had put its stamp upon him . His scant shirt hung only to his knees , and he was girt about by a chain . He stood in front of us for perhaps two hours , staring with melancholy eyes ? eyes a little mad . Now and again he stood for minutes at a time on one leg like a stork , supporting one knee in the slack of his chain . From the chain dangled some small pieces of steel . " What , " I asked , " are those for ? " " To make fire on the road : he walks much , " replied one of the gang . " He is a holy man , " he added , lolling across the table , ribaldry in his eye . " Give him money . " He conveyed this request in Spanish , then in French and English , aiding himself by expressive , if vulgar , jerks of his thumb . He continued to loll with easy insolence and beg pence for the holy man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would make off with it , jeering the easy stranger ; but here it was that our boy went back on us . Ile did n't play the game fairly , where in that shifting crowd he was the only familiar thing we had to cling to . He did not make off with it . He took the penny to the holy man , who , without glancing at it ? or at the boy ? without taking his speculative eyes from us , put it absently away . However , whether the boy also had corners in his mind that were obscure , at least he was the most intelligible thing about us . Moreover , one needs a boy to cry " Balak ! " ( Make way ! ) as one goes abroad , and when etching to keep pious little Arabs from spitting upon the infidel picture-maker.  |p817  The day that word had gone abroad that we needed a hired boy , Mohammed squatted unobtrusive on the ground beside us as we sat in front of a cafe . He was dressed in a frayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , been white , over a plum-colored kaftan ; and on his feet were immense brogans of European make . Also he smoked a short-stemmed American pipe . When we moved , so did he . From time to time he murmured in the ear of one of us : " Moi attrape bon burrico , regle prix . " And from time to time one of us replied that , as it looked like rain , we did not want burricos even at regulated prices . Which statement left him smiling and calm and hopeful . When we stopped to make some small purchase , he held out his hand for the parcel . Mechanically we gave it him . " Combien paye ? " he asked . We told him . " Moi attrape moins prix , " he told us , gently . As we dickered for a cleaner young Moorish hired boy he stood by without comment and without offering himself for the service , but went with us , now pushing the traffic of Tangier from our path , now dropping back to murmur his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What happened next merely shows the hypnotic power of a constantly reiterated suggestion . All the morning we had listened to a flow of gentle talk , at what price donkeys could be caught by the day , by the half-day , by the week , at an everdiminishing rate . To get rid of him we offered him a price very much less than anything he had mentioned for two donkeys and a mule in the afternoon , if it did n't rain . " Moi trape , " he asserted , cheerfully . After luncheon it drizzled , but word came that our donkeys were at the door . Well , there they were , and we fooled ourselves into assuming that this was the end of the rain and we might as well set out , for the sun was shining on Spain over the way . Then he drove our donkeys through roads sweet with eucalyptus , sealed walls to pick us other people 's flowers with unofficious zeal , and led us up a high hill past lovely half-wild Moorish gardens , to  |p818  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and whence one may see all the coast of Spain , and DjebelTarik and Djebel-Musa standing sentinels at the gate of the Mediterranean . And when it rained in torrents : " Fait rien , moi reglc , " he assured us . " Moorish coffee , " and drove the beasts through a narrow gateway into a garden where a solitary Moor grows vegetables and flowers and makes hot , sweet Moorish coffee over a tiny charcoal fire between two stones . The " Coffee " itself was a hut with a floor of beaten earth ; its supports were untrimmed sticks , and a tree grew through it . Part of the floor was raised , and on the raised part were spread pieces of clean matting : the Moor 's bedding ? a blanket and mattress ? was stowed away overhead . Both sides and roof were thatched , the sides mud-plastered . Besides the simple utensils for coffeemaking , the blanket a n d glasses , there were absolutely no furnishings of any kind . And this is the type of house in which all the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a multiplicity of things . 1 i v e consequently clean , without disorder or litter . Then the rail ceased , and the sun that had been shining in Spain shone also in Tangier ; the Moor made us presents of flowers , which grew here without being asked . Mohammed left us at the door of our hotel , asking gently at what time he should catch burricos tomorrow . When we went in town in the morning he followed us . When it rained greatly , when we took shelter in a cafe , again he sat without , the hood of his djellab drawn over his head ? sat there patient and watchful , and again followed us home . After dusk , when the rain had stopped , we wandered through the Moorish town , up one narrow street and down another . There arose before us a figure in the dusk . It was Mohammed . " You are lost . " he told us , with the same gentle finality with which he had mentioned burricos . " I will show you the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My house , " he announced , pointing down an alleyway where blackness brood/ ed . " You wish to come to my house ? " Ile started down a street to go into which was like plunging into sheer night . In the darkness we found a door which opened upon a tiny picture from the Arabian Ahab is . In a little room hardly bigger than a large-sized stateroom were two women and five children , sitting on the floor . All were pretty , and all dressed in colors that made the place bright as with flowers . It was a very poor house , but the harmony of tones robbed it of sordidness . The absence of things kept it from disorder ; and this blessed absence of things makes of life a saner place for rich and poor . What we saw in the house of Mohammed was confirmed in the houses of rich and poor that we saw later , always an absence of things , always the beauty which comes from simplicity . Every time Europe had touched them it was to bring things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moor who had spent much time in London , ugly Brussels carpets covered floors and cushions in place of the rugs of native make , while four particularly monumental clocks each told time in a different way . In Mohammed 's house they had no clock , but brought forward ? from the upper bed ? a European bent-wood chair . It seemed a symbol of our cumbrous and unlovely way of living . We felt ourselves out of place in this scene ; our clothes were ugly , and we were conscious that we had shoes upon our feet , and that we came from , a country crowded with bureaus and cook-stoves ? their evening meal of kooskoos was steaming in a charming earthen pot over a small fire of charcoal . What could we say to them ? There were children to be smiled at , but what remained then ? We had not one single experience in common , let alone an idea ; but here the mother of Mohammed began a voluble tale . Her accents were those of complaint . She talked without consciousness that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to another , and her words flowed . Mohammed at the door shifted feet , and in answer to the question :  |p820  " What does she say ? " " Nothing , " he replied , uncomfortably . " Nothing . " Here she laid her face on her hand , then shook her head at Mohammed ; and here comprehension came . We had seen Mohammed on the street at two the night before . " Mohammed , " we asserted , " she is saying you do n't come home when you should at night . " Iler eyes met ours , she spoke again , and again comprehension came . It was no longer one woman to another between us ; we were now speaking in that universal tongue in which it seems one mother of boys may speak to another anywhere in the world . " You spend your time in the cafes , Mohammed , " we interpreted . Here she held up a bare foot and pointed at Mohammed 's European shoes , which he had varied twice in our short acquaintance . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt your feet . " Another gesture and m o r e words . " She says that you spend money smoking and drinking in cafes , that you buy things to eat continually , instead of coming home for meals . " And , indeed , there was no hour of the day when Mohammed did not buy sweet cakes or sugarcane , dried peas or oranges . Tangier is full of the things a boy can nibble on . " She says , Mohammed , that we are to stop you and make you bring your money home ? and now she says you have given her none to-day . Give her , Mohammed , what you have earned . " Then , amid suitable salutations , we took our departure , once more our feet on firm ground , secure in one thing , that when the East and the West meet , two women can more easily bridge . the gulf of religion and language and custom if they are both mothers of small boys . The next day , as we sat in the cafe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tea flavored with mint , and on his feet were a new pair of old shoes . There approached us an immaculate small boy . Before he could speak , Mohammed had mobilized himself . There ensued altercations in Arabic . Nose approached nose until only half an inch separated them . Then Mohammed turned to us and , with impassive amiability , exclaimed : " He says he has come to be your hired boy . I tell him I am that boy . " Then ,  |p821  to the boy , with an impressive gesture of the foot , " Zid ! " Which , being interpreted , is , " Get out ! " Undoubtedly he was that hired boy . He had won the right to it , after the manner of the East , by patience and the power of sitting unfretted for long hours without intruding himself ; also by being the first to give us a glimpse of what goes on behind walls , and so a vision of the things which contribute to the serenity of Moorish faces . So it was Mohammed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great market , at the top of the street , outside the city walls ? crying " Balak ! " among the crowd of women dressed in creamcolored , homespun haiks , and pushed from our path men in their cream or brown djellabs ? tribesmen from the hills . Strong brown men they are , with legs built for walking rapidly up and down hills , with strapping barelegged wives as strong as they , girt around from waist to knee with striped cloth by way of petticoat , their heads modestly covered the while with heavy haiks . Mohammed was necessary . This crowd is too busy buying and selling and trafficking , after the manner of the East , to mind jostling a casual European woman not accompanied by a servant . They stop to buy bread from the line of white-muffled Riff women sitting cross-legged before their piles of loaves ; and they gather around the herds of goats and sheep , for here everything from hens to beef is sold on the hoof . It was around this market that we idled , for here everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not easily get tired of watching the crowd weave new patterns in cream and brown around the piles of yellow oranges and orange pumpkins and carrots ? a crowd whose color scheme is forever enlivened by a child dressed in some wonderful color . When you think in terms of color about Tangier . drop the European color scheme and think in terms of Chinese color ; think of pure orange , and burnt-orange , and the royal yellow of the dragon ; think of peacock blue , and peacock green , and call to your mind the varied notes of salmon pink which you have seen in Eastern stuffs ? all colors which weather and fade into tones very caressing to the eyes . With many other things , you leave behind you in Gibraltar the SouthEuropean pinks and blues . The city gates open on this market ; at night they are locked and barred , but a short , well-paved street , la rue de Fez , has been cut into the market , and it has no gate ; so whoever chooses may come freely by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blue city cut by brown walls of the citadel , climbs a hill . It climbs the hill by a maze of wandering streets that turn on themselves with the end in view of keeping the stranger from ever finding his way about . If language is to hide thoughts , the streets of Tangier are designed to prevent traffic ; without Mohammed we would have been always lost , for never was there such a place for losing oneself . Two things only are certain : those who go up-hill must at last find themselves within the citadel , where is the court of justice and the empty treasury , and where is also the prison , into which files a ceaseless procession of women bearing food to their men , for the government of Morocco does not feed its prisoners . The other thing of which one may be sure is that going down-hill will land one some time in the main street . The houses themselves are not beautiful ? square , two - storied , flat - roofed chunks of stucco , eaveless and sometimes windowless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had been shaved of all that gives a house character with us ? and yet for all that with a character of their own . " Here we are , " they seem to say . " Everything for those who live in us , and nothing for the curious passer-by . " The streets , however , are ever varied from monotony . Now the second story juts out so far that only a slit of sky appears above ; now the street is covered with a series of arches , and all of it is built on so inconsequent a plan as if the town had been laid out over the trail of a wandering blind man . In the daytime one looks into countless little holes in the wall , where sit Moors drinking tea , or into a succession of gay little shops . Here and there you may glance into courtyards so narrow and painted so deep a blue that the air in them seems like pools of blue light . At evening the cafes and shops  |p822  change into jewels of light , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark string of the street . Here and there a doorway opens to show a room jewelled with tiles , and the more you go about the town the more you come to a realization that behind these walls a life goes on that you can not understand . Outside the town is something comprehen-sible , something that even a person who knows nothing of worldpolitics may make a true guess at . There are villas and more villas ; you can see them standing on the hill of the Marshal , affrontingly European , malproportioned , unlovely ? and built to stay . Europe has encamped itself solidly without the walls of Tangier , and even built itself a big factory chimney which rears its head like an ugly giant sure of victory in the very face of the Moorish city . Behind the big market the wall of the church garden rises , just beyond the place where caravans of small camels grunt through their restless night ; within the neat walls sits the English church , squat and aggressive , and on the hill above is a hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Riviera . In the country behind are more villas , belonging to Englishmen , Frenchmen , to Spaniards and to Germans , while crowding close to the left flank of Tangier is the new quarter built by a French syndicate on French lines ? this within six or seven years ; there is even under construction a boulevard overlooking the bay . So Tangier , the Moorish town , sits on the hill , while Europe builds her houses on her flanks . You may find the Spanish refuse of the water-front give place to France , France under her smuggish and most bourgeois aspect ; and because Tangier is an infidel city , the Jews live in all quarters except the Kasbah and the near-by district . To us Europe comes poor and comes to work . Europe comes to Morocco rich , to take what it can get by what means it may . And though the Moor m a y walk over Europeans , because he looks upon them as ( logs of Christians as much as he did in the times of the Arabian Nights , yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that European is tried in his own consular court ; and again , if a Moor injures a European , that European promptly complains to his consular court , which demands immediate retribution from the Basha . In the city are four foreign post offices ? French , English , Spanish , and German ? and while Europe sits and waits , it has built schools for itself . There is a large College Francais , also a new Lycee , a Deutsche schule , and large Spanish schools , as well as that of the Alliance Israelite . Within a mile of Tangier the Infidel , there are rich and uncultivated hills ? and the Arab ploughs after the manner of 1000 B.C. in Palestine . The road to the great capital of Fez is only a track in the mud , and a track that shifts its course from year to year as a restless river shifts its bed . The " cake of custom " has not hardened as yet . Tribe still fights tribe ; for these men with peaceful faces are fighters . Some one has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sword ? these people have both .  |p823
