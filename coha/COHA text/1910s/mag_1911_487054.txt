Ferrero 's brilliantly constructed volumes on the " Greatness and Decline of Rome " have been widely read and enjoyed for their literary quality ; but it is well known that in his attempts to Undermine the work of ages of careful German , French , and English scholarship , he has carried with him no large portion of those whose knowledge of the subject goes deep enough to give special weight to their judgment . In " The Women of the Csars " the characteristics of his previous method are readily apparent  --  his assaults on troublesome statements of Tacitus , Suetonius , or Bic ) , his occasional perversion or their text to serve nis purpose , and his constant putting forth under the outward guise of well established fact statements for which there is no historical evidence whatever . The characters in which he goes farthest from the traditional estimate are Julia , the daughter of Augustus , the two Agrippines , and Messalina . In the case of Livia , wife of Augustus , he denounces as absurd the suspicion transmitted by Tacitus that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood between her son and the throne . True , Tacitus does not indicate his - own belief in these fugitive accusations , but before we discard them utterly we need to take a more careful account of the difference in the times than Ferrero apparently does . Most of those who take the trouble to read what ancient authors really say about Livia , rather than what a few of later date think , will be convinced that Caligula had a momentary gleam of insight when he characterized her as " Ulysses stolatus , " Ulysses in petticoats . Ferrero 's estimate- of Julia will be best understood in the light of a passage from the closing volume of his " Greatness and Decline of Rome " : " The horrors , related of Julia are undoubtedly fictions invented by her enemies . It should first be noted that such terrible accusations will seem in themselves improbable to all who believe that the average of mankind , under average conditions , are - neither particularly goad nor particularly bad . " The closing statement may be true enough , but to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falsity of charges against any individual is neither more nor less logical than it would be to appeal to the mortality tables of life insurance experts to settle the question whether Terentia , the wife of Cicero , a woman given to severe attacks of rheumatic gout in her thirties , lived to the age of one hundred and three , as there is some evidence to indicate . Ferrero 's positive admissions as to Julia 's offences go far enough to establish the entire possibility of all that he denounces as absurd and unthinkable , and he should have been content to say , what all will admit , that particular incidents in the story may be exaggerated or invented . The real ground for sympathy with Julia lies not in denying or minimizing her faults , but in recognizing the probability that a woman of keen intellect , brilliant wit , and great possibilities as a social leader , fell finally as a moral victim to the heartless way in which her person was made a mere pawn in the game of imperial politics . As regards Messalina , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basing upon a passage in Suetonius the theory that her culminating offence of marriage with Silius was preceded by a divorce from Claudius . But Merivale 's account has at least the merit of quoting in full the text of Suetonius upon which it rests . There is no real difficulty in the construction of the words of Suetonius , as Merivale thinks , or in determining his own attitude towards the version of the famous occurrence to which he al . ludes . It was simply a story that Claudius was influenced to believe that certain portents threatened danger to the husband of Messalina , and thus assisted in giving her , technically , another husband , in order to avert the danger from himself . The uZh fci omnem Mein excesserit of Suetonius , in its context , ought to settle at once the fact that he did not believe the story , and every existing authority confirms the traditional account , which is that the marriage with Sinus was actually carried through to its consummation , while Messalina was still the legal wife of Claudius . Even with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may find such action hard to explain ; but before we construct a new Messalina based on the rejection of this and other attested offences of her brief career as grossly improbable , we should duly consider the question whether there is not a still grosser improbability in the supposition that the uncontradicted account of her given by various writers whose fathers ' lives had spanned the whole extent of her own , is nothing but a tissue of malignant falsehood. - Ferrero 's estimate of the elder and the younger Agrippina tallies pretty closely with that of Baring-Gould 's " Tragedy of the Cnsars , " substantially interchanging the traits of the mother and daughter in important particulars , as compared with the accounts which have come down to us in the ancient texts . His handling of those texts may be illustrated by one or two references to the account which Tacitus gives of the trial of Cnnus Piso for the alleged poisoning of Germanicus , and other offences . " All the enemies of Tiberius . . . even began to repeat , " he tells us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to poison Germanicus . " What Tacitus Says is that he had personally heard from elderly men that during the trial Piso had in his possession a document said by his friends to contain literas Tiberii et mandata in Germanicutn , which comes far short of an " order to poison Germanicus . " As to the specific form in which the charge of poisoning was made against Piso , Ferrero asserts that " Tacitus himself says that every one thought this an absurd fable . " Possibly they did , but the every one is of Ferrero , not of Tacitus . He simply says absurdum videbatur , and the tense of the verb , with no dative case to indicate anybody else , leaves the author 's view unstated , and must normally be taken as - referring the opinion to the Senate , before which the trial was held . Such matters may seem of little importance singly , but they represent a method the persistent use of which must hopelessly vitiate the historical credibility of any author who indulges in it . The younger Agrippina Ferrero easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of honor as one of the noblest women of imperial Rome . This we are to accept not on the basis of positive evidence , for he adduces none , but simply because it is absurd to believe anything else ! We have dwelt upon the fictions of Ferrero until there is little space left for the more extended volume of McCabe , who strives for completeness even - to the extent of fumbling amid the tumbling ruins of the Western Empire for shadowy " Empresses " whose very names he can not discover . In general , - he makes no such attempts to reverse historical evidence as we find in Ferrero , though he too regards as " absurd " : many alleged occurrences which , while they may possibly not be true , are not without numerous parallels in every age of history . Have these writers for -- gotten that one of the most persistent human traits is to do the absurd ? His frequent attacks on Tacitus for using the memoirs of the younger Agrippina lead one to wonder how much longer the nonsense ' of that particular indict -- meat is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigation . Ta citus mentions these memoirs just once , as containing a statement that the elder Agrippina had asked Tiberius to arrange for her a second marriage . We are absolutely without proof that they are the basis of any of his estimates as to events and characters of the age of Tiberius , nor , on the other hand , have we any proof that he would have been seriously misled if he had used them . We simply know nothing about them but the one statement above mentioned , and the statement in the eider Pliny , Neronent pectibus genitum scribit parens emus Agrippina . Tacitus had his likes and dislikes , and they were strong . Further , his adverse judgments have led careless readers still farther afield , and to overlook his own statements of counterbalancing fact which often furnish the necessary corrective . Thus the somewhat radical revision of opinion concerning Tiberius which has slowly made its way during recent decades finds its soundest basis right in the pages of Tacitus , which would not have been the case if he had not deliberately striven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ razed to the ground , one readily sees what fine building sites would exist for " True Neros , " " Real Messalmas , " " Actual Agrippinas , " etc . But Tacitus will be demolished only by heavier missiles than have yet been thrown . In the meantime , it is more profitable to understand him than to assail him , and to accept his estimates , with due allowance , in preference to those of modern theorizers who base their conclusions largely on their inner consciousness CURRENT FICTION . The Case of Richard Heynell . By Mrs. Humphry Ward . New York : Doubleday , Page &; Co . The Elsmere case twenty years after is virtually the theme of this long story . The widow and daughter of that defeated enthusiast appear again ; and his shadow is always dimly perceptible in the background of the action . Evidently , Mrs. Ward 's deep interest in the condition of the English Church has grown deeper since the writing of " Robert Elsmere . " She believes that the past century has been " as pregnant with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed the birth of Christ . " She does not profess to foresee what the outcome for the Church of England is to be . " Whether the old bottles can be adjusted to the new wine , whether further division or a new Christian unity is to emerge from the strife of tongues , whether the ideas of modernism , rife in all forms of Christianity , can be accommodated to the ancient practices and given a share in the material possessions of the State Church " ? these are the larger themes she here attempts to deal with . But , of course , ' the interest of the story , as a story , depends on the vividness with which she may have been able to depict the play of human character in contact with these problems . One almost always feels of Mrs. Ward that , in this respect , she fares better than her intent . Here , for example , if we are to take her preface at its face-value , her conscious preoccupation is with her theme and not with her people . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religion and philosophy during the twenty-two years that have passed since the writing of " Robert Elsmere . " And she hopes that the American readers who welcomed that book " may be drawn once again to some of the old themes in their new dress . " We suppose that " Robert Elsmere " owed its American welcome , not to the accident of its theological atmosphere , but to the feeling that real persons were concerned in the action . Of this book the same thing would be true . In so far as it is to be taken as a sugar-coated treatise on the Modernist movement in the English Church , the ordinary American novel-reader would regard it with tolerance or less . But the fact that Richard Meynell and several others who have their being between these covers are persons worth attending to , is the important matter . Meynell is merely a country rector in the ecclesiastical scale ; but he is at once a scholar in the modern sense , and a minister in the early Christian sense . His parish lies in a mining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and miner alike . But the creeds and forms of the English Church are dead to these people , and he sees the need of infusing new life into Church observance . He is in the van of Modernism , but believes that the national church ought to have room for all who love and serve Christ  --  or the ideal of which Christ is the symbol . The English preoccupation with the question of property rights comes into it all to a degree rather odd from the American point of view . That is , while Meynell is not concerned to retain his right to live at the expense of the Establishment , and has indeed long renounced that right , he is very much concerned that the magnificent possessions of the church shall not be sequestered from the use of those who are merely endeavoring to keep that great institution healthily alive , through inevitable processes of change . In Elsmere 's day the whole situation had been different . The natural thing for him to do , with his opinions , was to leave the church .

Apart from the incidents of religious conflict , the plot is both sensational and conventional . Mother : A Story By Kathleen Norris . New York ' The Macmillan Co . " Mother " has been a favorite heroine among novelists recently , from Gorky to Kate Douglas Wiggm . On the whole , she has fared none too well , - figuring for the most part either as a hopeless and thankless drudge , or as a sort of ever-blooming household fairy such as never was . The " Mother Carey " of Mrs. Riggs 's recent tale , for example , belonged to the latter class . The " Mother " of the present story is a far more natural person , presented , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the busy centre and life of a respectable village family which has been brought up to " scrimp . " The father is a sufficiently amiable little weak man whose only distinction is his office of pater laminas . The children , half grown up , are not markedly better or worse , cleverer or less clever , than the ordinary group of children in their position  --  with the exception , perhaps , of the oldest daughter , a beautiful and potentially brilliant girl , ambitious socially and otherwise , who at the moment the story opens has reached the point of rebellion against the limitations of village life . To her at this critical moment comes a wonderful being in a motor-car , a famous leader of New York society . This great personage takes a fancy to Margaret Paget and engages her incontinent as private secretary . The rest of the tale , so far as it is a tale , has to do with her gradual enlightenment as to the hollowness of the world of fashion and her discovery that the humble mother she has left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idle employer . And , of course  --  for this is a human book  --  there is a nice young man in reserve for Margaret , whom she has met in the great world . It is he who really opens her eyes to the relative value of things . He is a very nice young man , and beautiful Margaret is lucky enough to be chosen of him . But it is not their little affair which gives the story its oddly pleasant savor . It is the fact that Mother , with what she stands for , supplies the atmosphere , clear and enfolding , for whatever event may chance among her own people . Interventions .

The Greatest Street in the World . By Stephen Jenkins . New York : G. P. Putnam 's Sons . $3.50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the business parts " of New York is to impose an unwonted strain upon the imagination , but such are the words which its historian uses in defining its position , geographical and other , in the days when , as one of the two principal towpaths of New Amsterdam , it was known as the Heere Straat . Indeed , so late as the early years of the nineteenth century , the idea was entertained of doing away with Broadway . One patriot designated it as " an accidental thoroughfare , " and the Commission which laid out the city as far into the wilderness as One Hundred and Fifty-fifth Street were driven by the resulting merriment of their fellow-Knickerbockers into apologizing for their optimism . In 1664 , when the Dutch flag gave way to the English , and the Heere Straat exchanged the name it had borne during the forty years of its humble existence for the one by which it is known all over the world , it extended only the short distance between the bowling green just outside Fort Amsterdam , newly re-christened Fort James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that marked the upper limit of the town , which it reached through the " land gate , " situated opposite the site of Trinity Church . From Bowling Green to Wall Street is less than a third of a mile , and if Broadway had continued to creep northward at the pace that satisfied it then , it would now be displaying an ambition to reach the vicinity of Astor Place in time to celebrate its three hundredth anniversary  --  which , with a spurt , it might accomplish . Its growth during the remainder of its first century , however , did not promise any such achievement , as by the end of that time it had arrived only at what is now City Hall Park . During the century and a quarter preceding 1850 , it exhibited something of the spirit that has animated it increasingly since that date , advancing to its Junction with the Bowery at Sixteenth Street at the apex of the present Union Square .

All- this is Broadway in New York city . Mr. Jenkins 's account traces the street all the way to Albany ; although the part north of the city line receives only 114 of his 468 pages . His plan is to take the street in sections , beginning at the southern end , a simple arrangement made possible by the generally northward trend of its development . In its upper portion , however , this union of geography and chronology is much less perfect . The book is historical , but hardly a history . It is more than annals , but it is not closely enough knit to be , or to leave the impression of being , a story . It contains little generalization and less style . More positive faults are an over-quoting of Irving , and statements of familiar and irrelevant facts . The most glaring instance of the latter occurs in correction with the mention of a statue of Seward , regarding whom the follower of Broadway 's progress is regaled with the information that " He was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at ChiCago in 1860 , but Abraham Lincoln beat him for the nomination . Lincoln made him his Secretary of State , and he held that position during the Civil War . " Perhaps the explanation in the Introduction , that the volume is the expansion of a lecture " to book size , " may account for these bits of erudition . The New York Evening Post , pace Mr. Jenkins , is not located " at present at the corner of Fulton Street and Broadway . " The possibilities of proofreading are exemplified now and then , the almost incredible error being made at one place of a reference to " Alfred Edward , Prince of Wales ( the late Edward VI ) " . But the volume is a repository of historical facts and illustrations , to which a copious index furnishes a ready key , and which is supplemented by an excellent bibliography .

A study in English Industrial Organisation . By Hermann Levy . New York : The Macmillan Co. $3.25 net . Professor Levy 's studies in English , German , and American capitalism have been of such high merit that an English translation of his brilliant essay " Monopole , Kartelle and Trusts " is ' most acceptable . It will bring to a wider public an acute analysis of a problem upon which , at present , too much light can not be thrown . The first half of the book is given to the early history of English industrial organization , in which the author disposes of the commonly accepted doctrine that the " freedom of industry " of the eighteenth century grew directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the contrary , there intervened between the local trade monopolies of the guilds and the economic liberalism of the age of industrial revolution , a century of nation-wide monopolies with a distinct capitalistic impress . The competition of the eighteenth century was a revolt against the monopoly of the seventeenth . Of particular interest is the author 's investigation of the Newcastle Vend , a combination in coal mining which existed in various forms for two hundred and fifty years , and finally gave way in 1844 before a competition coming from the development of transportation . This portion of the work will have an especial interest for economic historians , and in its succinct treatment will form an admirable supplement to Dr. Scott 's elaborate study of joint-stock-companies to 1720 . But the general reader will rather turn to that section of the essay which bears upon present day conditions in England . Here Professor Levy 's purpose is to show the peculiar influences that have shaped the development of English industrialism as it appears today , and his method is inductive throughout . It is a striking fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lasting monopolist combinations have developed very much more slowly than in Germany , Prance , or America , and are just now beginning to assume any importance . The psychological explanation , that this is due to the prevalencethere of the doctrines of extreme individualism , Dr. Levy summa -- ily rejects , and while admitting that the nation as a whole still believes that it has won free competition in industry for all time , shows by historical evi dence that it was not through any lack of disposition on the part of manufac Curers that thby have not 4mitated their confreres across the seas , nor was it because their consciences have been trouLied by thoughts of economic freedom . The explanation of the lack of concentrated organization must be sought in the conditions of production and sale of the commodities which are still subject to competition and of those which are not And here a brief summary of the author 's conclusions must suffice . In the first place , in mineral deposits , from which in all parts of the world Trusts have so often got their suprema , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neither in the world 's market nor at home does there exist a monopoly of any mineral of importance to industry . In the case of coal , stone , and earths , manifold sources of production and facility of transportation have prevented any combination . In iron ore , dependence to some extent upon foreign supplies and the ease and cheapness of transport , which robs home ore of the protective effect of freights , make monopoly impossible . Monopoly is consequently excluded from the sphere in which it has been most marked in other countries . Secondly , as to the " finishing trades . " Free trade is a sufficient explanation of the non-existence of Trusts in a large portion of the industries producing manufactured goods , and with this should be taken into account the fact that the protective effect of freights , which is of real significance in many countries , can to an island with but a small inland area , be of little or no importance in the case of high-priced goods shipped often only short distances by water . But in many trades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the persistence of competition lies in this , As compared with other countries , especially the United States and Germany , the size of undertakings is relatively small , due to the fact that the need for vertical combination or " integration , " as we call it , is less . And the need for integration is less , because of the failure of monopoly in raw materials , and hence of the freedom of the manufacturer from the danger of extortion on the part of furnishers of his raw products . It is easier to start competing works in England , because the amount of capital necessarily involved in an industry embracing all processes from raw material to finished product is not required by the manufacturer . Under what circumstances then are Trusts found to exist ? In the first place , the industry must be free from foreign competition , owing either to the low cost of production , , reliance upon some natural facility like a water-power , the manufacture of some special quality in steady demand , traditional dexterity , or international agreement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small , and there can be no bolstering of prices through the aid of monopolized raw materials . Hence even in the absence of foreign competition , a successful monopoly can only be established when the number of competing firms is relatively very small , and when fresh competition is not to be expected , except after a considerable period . Concentration of works and undertakings is the foundation of English trusts . While Professor Levy will not pronounce a general verdict on the economic effect of actual prices obtained by English monopolist organizations , deeming such a verdict impossible in a country free from the influences of a protective tariff , he has no doubt of the monopolistic trend of these combinations ; he- declares that they raise prices above the competitive level and that they reveal their tendency in their practice of dividing markets . His most significant contributions to our own Trust problem are his complete demonstration of the monopolistic influence of a protective tariff , and of the control of raw materials We may well ponder the following statement : . A. great many industries in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firms , but in which foreign competition has so far prevented a monopolist combination , would under a tariff straightway be in a position to found cartels and trusts Moses Coat Tyler , 1835-1900 .

Time and again , however , he is asked to linger over edifying New Year 's resolutions or the intimate reflections inspired by a birthday anniversary .

The last stage of one hundred and twenty-five miles he made tucked into a sleigh with six other members of the family , behind the incomparable horse Pompey , while an older brother , afoot , drove the cow . Even as a boy he was " determined to be a scholar at all events . " But on receive ing an A.B . degree from Yale in 1857 , he studied theology for two years and serv ? ed as a Congregational minister till his health failed . For the next three years he led a precarious existence , chiefly in England , lecturing on physical culture and other topics . In all likelihood it was his letters to the-Independent while abroad that , in 1867 , a few months after his return , helped him to a professorship of English in the University of Michigan .

He soon found the subject an " unexplored territory , " Ind determined to survey it thoroughly . " The element of time , " he wrote , " is unspeakably inferior ' to the element of thoroughness .

He lived through a period of the most profound and impressive change , yet the movements of national development drew from him no expression of concern or exultation . He studied minutely the formative period of our great republic , yet the political significance of events in that epoch received scant consideration . He wrote an exhaustive history of our early literature , yet therein appreciation of literature as an art is purely incidental . In short , he seldom lingered in the world of ideas .

The author of this sumptuous book has brought industry , enthusiasm , and skill to the difficult task of giving within moderate compass a survey of the civilization of Ancient Greece from the earliest traceable period to the absorption of that country into the Roman Empire , with less stress laid upon conflicts with foreign or domestic foes than upon the development of civil government and the arts of peace He has produced ( to use ' his own words I a kind of history of Greece " with statues and poems taking the place of wars and treaties .

The much-discussed " . , Egm , n " civilization ( " My- , cenan " or " Minoan " or " Cretan , " as it has been variously called ) receives careful treatment , and the relations of this type of culture to the " Homeric " civilization are-well and clearly brought out .

Egmans ) whose culture we have been describing were essentially the same as we know in his. , toric times , and of course Indo-Europeans . " ( Does this mean that he still holds the now discredited theory of an " Indo-European race " ? ) Here and there occur slight slips which might easily have been avoided ; for instance , - the brother of Hesiod is thrice within two pages called Persis instead of Perses . At times the always lively style comes dangerously near to flippancy ; and such a sentence as " It is astonishing to find the Cretan of 1911 B c. writing , as we write to-day , with pen and ink " is likely to mislead the unwary layman into supposing that we can date the Cretan remains as accurately as - that .

The author 's leanings are evidently towards the sort of interpretation of which Prof. Gilbert Murray is the chief spokesman . Mr. Stobart has made his selection of the very numerous and varied illustrations with excellent judgment , drawing from a very wide range of sources . A few specimens are included that have not been adequately published elsewhere , or at most in works not easily reached by the layman ; for example , the contemporary marble copy of the " Agias " of Lysippus recently found at Delphi , and the reliefs , now in Boston , which correspond with such curious exactness to those on the famous " Ludovisi Throne " in Rome . In excellence of mechanical execution the illustrations differ greatly ; those from photographs are generally admirable , but the drawings are hardly up to the proper standard for such a work .
