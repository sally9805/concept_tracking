A fact , if it is a fact , is that these things seem to occur , or recur , in a sort of cycle , " that one of us remarked who had been reading aloud from a week - old newspaper , and now dropped the sheet as if to have both bands free for shaping his theory . " Do n't all things occur , or recur , in a sort of cycle ? " one of the listeners asked . " That would n't make the suggestion from this incident less interesting . But I was thinking of a certain parity in the psychological situation at the close of the eighteenth century and the psychological situation at the close of the nineteenth . In the eighteenth century atheism had reached its climax , and in the nineteenth agnosticism ; the terms are loose , but you know what I mean . In each case the prevailing tendency seemed to have exhausted itself . People could n't keep on saying forever , ' I do n't believe , ' and , ' I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one another , Why ? That gave Faith a chance , and the Ewig-Geistliche came to her help . What we call the Other World , for want of a better name , had been pushed to the utmost bounds of thinkability , and suddenly it began to roll back . I have the case in the eighteenth century especially in mind . The Wesleyan rise of religious feeling was accompanied or preceded by vivid , not to say violent , demonstrations from the Other World . Ghosts we have always bad with us , though from time to time we gather heart to contemn them , to ignore them ; but now they began to insist upon themselves , to demand recognition . Just as in this case at South Hanover , Mass. , they began to throw things about , to bang them and break them , and to make a row . " " To adopt suffragette methods , " we ventured . " Yes , suffragette methods ; it is n't a bad notion ; and in both instances the demonstrations took place in the houses of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Methodism and in the house of a Catholic priest . I do n't remember just how far the Wesleyan agencies went in their demonstrations , and the parallel is n't very close at all points ; I do n't understand that the priest who has been driven out of his house by like agencies is perfervid or different from other clergymen secure in the authority of his Church . Still , in a large , flexible way there is a parallel . " " It 's as good a parallel , " one of the listeners said , " as the one you have n't established in point of time . Did you mean , when you set out , to establish the supposition that these situations , these moods , or whatever , recurred at intervals of a hundred years , or fifty ? Or how many ? " " I thought I could do something of that kind when I began ; but I ca n't ? temporally speaking ; and yet the cycle may be much more perfect if we leave out the notion of time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than space does . That world may be revolving in an orbit as perfect as that of the earth , which now confessedly wabbles in its round , and it may approach ours at intervals which , if we dissociate them from the notion of time , are regular ? or regular enough . " " Oh ! " " What I do mean to establish is the supposition that the Other World , when it has been pushed to the utmost bounds of thinkability , always swings back and swings nearer than before , with the effect , often , of throwing things about , of banging and breaking them , of at any rate making a row , of using suffragette methods to force recognition and respect from those who would ignore it , contemn it . " Of course , we immediately , all of us , disabled our friend 's judgment , and measurably his sanity . When a man so much as hints at the unity of life in this world and some world beyond it , at the idea in which the Christian religion began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not do less than think him some sort of fool . But now we let our friend go on ; as much to hear what folly he would speak next as anything else . " Now , mind , " he said ; " I am merely defining a situation ; I infer nothing from it in the way of a belief , " and at this we winked , one to another . " Perhaps I can make the thing clearer if I speak of it as the Opposition of the Other World , like the Opposition of Mars . " " But that , " a second listener said , " takes place without throwing things about , or banging and breaking them . " " Perhaps . Though perhaps somewhere in the outer rim of our atmospheric envelope worse happens from Mars in his Opposition than happened at South Hanover , Mass. , from the Opposition of the Other World . However , - that 's neither here nor there . The question is whether we are now at the hither limit of another era of the supernaturalism which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rappings in 1848-50 , and swept like wild - fire over the civilized world . " " It 's very polite of you to call it supernaturalism , " the first listener said . " I should call it the grossest materialism , of the earth earthiest , both in the mediums and their means . " " I will call it anything you like if you will let me go on , " the involuntary champion of mystery returned . " I want , in the first place , to get out of the position you seem to be forcing me into . I no more affirm that these things happened from the Other World than you do ; not perhaps so much , if you are shrinking from them . All I know of the doings , or misdoings , at South Hanover , Mass. , is that the priest was driven out of his house by them , and that he seems to be staying out of it because of them . Before this incident ? I suppose I may call it an incident ? the Other World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Psychical Research had rendered it partially respectable , at much cost to the researchers , but the universal tipping of tables had long before stopped ; not a rap was heard on anybody 's wall or head - board . The spiritualists probably still numbered some millions , and had their meetings and camp-meetings ; but their vulgarity no longer shocked or amused ; I do n't know but they were reforming their worship into something acceptable to people of taste ; and Christian Science had risen to replace it in the derision of polite persons . Then , suddenly , from a clear sky , bursts this tempest of demonstrations at South Hanover , Mass. , and , of all places , in the house of an Irish Catholic priest . As I recall the history of the supernaturalism dating from the Rochester Rappings , nothing so violent has since happened in it unless it was the stone-throw ings in the Phelps house in Connecticut ? another clerical mansion . " We wished to bring ourselves forward again , and we said , " Suffragette methods had n't been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after suffering the laugh which we got . " Perhaps the provocation had n't become so great . I can imagine the Other World 's enduring the positive denial of the eighteenth century a great deal better than the passive refusal of the nineteenth . It might very well have found the cold courtesy of agnosticism harder to bear than the insolent arrogance of atheism . " " Yes , " we admitted . " Or there may have been a decay of manners in the Other World . It 's notorious that the spirits who wish to communicate with This World are earth-bound spirits . They are those who have remained low-minded and rather groveling in their tastes and ideals , or have n't yet freed themselves from the earthly influences . Those vulgarer and coarser spirits in the Other World hang about This to all eternity , and watch their chance to break into our mortal cognizance . Possibly the modern disturbances in our moral atmosphere invite them . There may be something very suggestive to them in the fact that a whole sex , more than half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can find no surer way to make the other half sit up and take notice than by smashing windows and flinging hatchets . " A lady listener spoke up . " I am a thorough suffragist , and I do not believe that is the surest way , or at all the way , for us to get the vote . " " Ah ! But those vulgarer and coarser spirits may differ . We think Swedenborg classes them as evil spirits ; at any rate , he does n't hold with them as desirable associates . " " I should think not , " our friend with the supposition broke in , " any more than we should hold with the militant suffragettes as agreeable acquaintance . But the question is whether these rude and violent spirits having forced a way into the seeing and hearing of This World , we are now about entering on a new era of spiritualism ; whether , from this fierce burst at South Hanover , Mass. , into our agnostic calm , the startled surface of our experience will spread in ripples of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again involved in rappings and tippings and tiltings and voices and apparitions , and then gradually subside in spoken and written messages of high unimportance from the Other World . Or will this priest , after waiting a reasonable time for the demonstrations to subside , go back into his house and live at peace there ? No one can forecast the event . Perhaps the Other World , having forced recognition from This , and set men 's minds in the direction of belief , will be satisfied . It may not be necessary to repeat that cycle of human experience . " " But has the Other World really forced that recognition ? " the first listener demanded . " I put it crudely but intelligibly : has anything whatever really happened at South Hanover , Mass . ? " " Why , my dear fellow , the papers have been full of it , " the theorist said , in polite amaze at incredulity so vast . " But for how long ? " " I do n't know ? several days . " " But now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it ! " " And then ? " " Then , nothing of the kind happened ; it has probably been found out something of a kind altogether different . I have watched the papers with as much interest as any one could , and they have dropped the incident with one consent . Do the breakings and hangings and throwings - about continue ? Does the priest remain out of his house , or hashe gone back into it ? Has his Church , which does not like outside supernaturalism , brought him to book for what he is said to have suffered from the Other World ? Does he stand to his experience , or does he disown it ? What do the judicial-minded neighbors say who gathered round the house the next night , and watched and listened in vain for the demonstrations ? Is there any such place as South Hanover , Mass. ? The press is silent on these points , not more on one than on another . " " Yes , you are quite right , " the other assented , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think the gazetteer will support the hypothesis of a South Hanover , Mass. ; and you must remember that we are in the midst of a very exciting political contest , and the papers are much preoccupied with the defamation of one another 's candidates for the Presidency . That would account for a great deal of reticence in their treatment of an incident which you 'll allow is extraordinary . " " I do n't care for its being extraordinary , " the other declared . " You began by inferring from it the possible close of that cycle of agnosticism in which the soul of man has rested since evolution began ? " Oh , I deny that it has rested ! " " Well , I do n't insist on the word . Say remained , or say found a refuge from affirmation and denial concerning the unknowable . Mind , I do n't call it the unthinkable ; we are always thinking it , or about it . But why suppose that the adoption of suffragette methods should mark an intention on the part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever been a moment since man ceased to be brute when This World was not recognizing the Other ? We call it the Other World . and rightly ; but it is no more the world beyond death than it is the world this side of death . We seem to have come out of it with an unmemoried consciousness of it which survives from inarticulate infancy into the last moments of age ; every night , if we have the luck , we pass into it , and every morning we come out of it ? how reluctantly ! As for the Other World beyond death , it has had its posts in This from the beginning of recorded time ; it garrisons our world with what we call haunted houses so thickly that no smallest village is without one , and whatever we pretend to think or say , our nerves confess that ghosts have never ceased to walk . It 's only concerning the visible and tangible that we are agnostic ; the things that our senses can not recognize we know with an intensity beyond all intimacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The other had the air of a man with the ground cut from under his feet , and we could not resist the humane impulse of coming to his aid . " It is consoling to find so much faith in an age which we had fancied steeped in skepticism . It is truly admirable to find you two united in one indissoluble conviction when we were afraid your conclusions had separated you forever . " " Yes , ' ' the last speaker resumed , " I maintain that agnosticism is a perpetual toleration of mystery as thinkable , and that the incident of South Hanover , Mass. , did not occur because it is unthinkable . But as for the supernatural , as for that which is above material means and instruments , which is conscious in us from the beginning to the end of life , I accept it with my whole being . It is my being . " We referred this bold position to our friend the theorist : " You ca n't ask more than that $ " " Oh , I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What I say is that there is such a place as South Hanover , Mass. , and that the things reported in the newspapers for three days , and then left , did happen from some unknown agency . As for those other things , those intimations of immortality , of pre-existence in our consciousness , and the recognition of post-existence by our nerves , shaken with the sempiternal vibration of primordial fear ? I do n't know about that . " " What ! " we exclaimed , with something like indignation . " You accept the grotesque incident reported at South Hanover , Mass. , as of possible psychical importance , and you reject those subtle , subjective evidences consecrated by universal experience as of doubtful value I " " A man has to doubt something , " he said . " It seems to be a matter of taste , " the suffragist said . " Does n't everybody feel that banging and breaking things , and throwing them about , is very indelicate ? I think that something more homeopathic would be quite as convincing or more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the milde Macht of ' filmy shapes that haunt the dusk ' is somehow more acceptable to the imagination than those rude demonstrations with flying clothes-racks and clocks hurtling through the air . The subtle apparitions of other days ? or nights ? which you could poke your finger through were certainly more reasonable , to say the least , than the materialization of modern spiritualism . " " But I deny utterly that it is a matter of taste , " the theorist exclaimed . " It is a matter of fact ? it is the evidence of the senses which you can not reject . " " Ah , if you come to matters of fact , as evidence , " one said who had not spoken before , " there is not only " this pleasing hope , this fond desire , . . . this dread of falling into naught , ' but there is the lifelong ache of bereavement , the lifelong demand of the soul for reunion with the soul that it loved and that has left it . " After that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
