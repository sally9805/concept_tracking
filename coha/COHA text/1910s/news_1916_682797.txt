txt On the final tour of his campaign in his home State today Charles E. Hughes took issue with President Wilson on the subject of Americanism . Replying to the assertion made by the President In Buffalo on Wednesday that he could not regard as a patriot any man who used . " our foreign relations for political advantage , " Mr. Hughes charged that the President 's conduct of international relations was well described , in the words of Disraeli , as " a muddle of meddle " that invited insult , hampered the advance of American trade , and endangered the lives of American citizens on land and on sea . " When a matter is so important as  --  the maintenance of American rights , " he said , ' it is highly necessary that American opinion should be expressed , and I have no apology to make in standing before you and saying that if I am elected Preside/IV , I propose that the American flag shall be not only a symbol of courtesy , a symbol of justice , but it shall be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights an land and on sea throughout the world . " Speaking tonight in Harmanus Bleecker Hall In Albany , where he was introduced by William Barnes , who opposed him bitterly when he was ' Governor of New ' York , Mr. Hughes added to his criticism of the President , " I like the phrase , ' The peace of a gentleman , ' " he 0=6. qt/oiling from one of the President 's addresses , " but it is the peace of a gentleman unafraid , alert in self-respect , and getting his rights , quietly and calmly ready to maintain them . That Is the peace of a ' gentleman . " ' 5n regard to the resignation of Secreip.nr Garrison , Mr. Hughes said : We did have In the Cabinet of this Administration a first-class man as our first Secretary of War , but he couid not live with the Administrationfand had to get out . " The Meeting with Barnes . Mr .. Hughes r received a five-minute demonstration when he enteted the ball here . His meeting with Mr. Barnes passed off without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the news got about that 2,1r . Barnes would preside . Mr. Hughes reached the hall at 10 o'clock . As he appeared in the wings a man shouted : " The next President of the United States . " There was a great hubbub and every one was on his feet . Mr. Barnes stood near the front of the platform as Mr. Hughes , smiling , passed by him and , walking to the other side of the stage , shook hands with men standing there . After the demonstration had proceeded about two minutes Mr. Barnes walked over to Mr. Hughes and greeted himj with a smiling face . There was e. cry : " Three cheers for Hughes , " and they ! were given . There were cries then for " Bill Barnes " and " . Colquel Roose-1 velt . " After one faint cheer for each the applause was turned back to Mr. Hughes . Mr. Barnes finally got the ' crowd quiet . In introducing Mr. Hughes he said : " There is one quality in a man who holds high office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In his responsibility to a great people he owes then the obligation that his deeds shall ccnform with his words . That the American people have not now , but will have in Mr. Hughes if elected . " The crowd rose , shouting . Mr. Hughes smiled at Congressman Henderson , who was standing between him and Mr. Barnes . When there was quiet again itr . Barnes . still smiling . sat down , and Mr. Hughes began to speak . After predicting victory in Ohio , Indiana , and New York . and in the nation , he pro= ceeded to outline his conception of leadership , turning it into shaft of criticism of the President . Must Subordinate Personalities . " He is not chosen , " he said , " to follow the whims of his fancy or to indulge in a license of freedom to follow his own personal choices in any direction to which his imagination might lead him . lie is the Executive under our constitutional system . charged with rite duty of managing the great business affairs of the United States . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efficient administration of the public business . He should never permit diplomatic agencies , for example , the organization of our great State Department and the representation of the nation in all its international relations , to be subordinated to a narrow conception of supposed partisan expediency . " I do not care to be . told , " he said later , " that great amounts of money have been appropriated for equipping our navy unless I am assured that we will have the business capacity in the management of the Navy Department which will assure well-spent dollars and a navy when the dollars are spent . Nor do I care for paper reorganization of the army , or mere bills for the purpose of adding to our forces , or provision for the expenditure of money in supplies necessary for the maintenance of our military establishment , unless we have competent business leadership . " Mr. Hughes concluded his address with the statement that he came into public life as the enemy of abuses , and that ' he stood against special privilege at the expense of public welfare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' at Schenectady this evening , where the crowd was so great that the members of the Hughes party had to fight their way to the entrance of the meeting place , the Van Curler Opera House , was greeted with sustained applause , and as Mr. Hughes went on to develop his beliefs on the question of Americanism and the leadership which this country should have he was frequently interrupted by the cheering . The tour started today at Batavia ' at 11:30 o'clock . It was a day of , big demonstrations . Besides Batavia , Oneida , Schenectady , Troy , and Albany were on the schedule , anti there was an added stop at Amsterdam , where 3,000 persons , most of them workers from the factories , collected at the station to cheer the nominee . At Schenectady , Troy , and Albany the streets livers jammed with people . Mr. Hughes began the day by expressing entire confidence as to the result on Nov. 7 in Indiana and Ohio , the States from which he had ' just come . In introducing his repo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing which impressed him more than anything else Was " the fine patriotic sentiment which is manifested by our people . " America must not be misrepresented " he continued . " We are not a decadent people . There would be no prosperity for the United States if we lost our self-respect . There is nothing more essential to the maintenance of our peace than that we should safeguard the rights of American citizens throughout the world . " Our opponents do not seem to like the idea of criticism with respect to international policy : but I beg to remind them that an American President is elected for a term of four years and that , under our institutions , at the conclusions of that term . the American people express their minds . " He then made his declaration in favor of maintaining American rights and went on : " That is not a policy that leads to war . In my judgment it is the condition upon which alone we can be assured of lasting peace . There never has been a time perhaps in our history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . of war than the last few years , when every nation engaged in the great strife abroad desired our friendship , and would not by reason of any assertion , of our just rights forfeit that friendship ! " Mr. Hughes then said that it was idle to expect success in the extension of our trade in foreign lands unless the interests of American citizens were protected . Old , Indomitable Spirit Necessary . " I am amazed to have anyone suppose that we can prosper in the extension of American trade throughout the world if our flag Is only an invitation to come home , " he said . " Men who before election are described as having the best genius an the world and as doing a duty to humanity should not be in danger , after election , of being called servants of their own private interests who take their lives in their own hands for their personal ends . The dignity of American citizenship , of one who is lawfully following his vocation anywhere , and his rights are recognized by our laws and Constitution as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not gifts for the Administration to bestow or to withhold in its discretion ; rather these are trusts to be sacredly guarded , and if we are to have peace , then we must have the esteem of other nations , and we can not have that esteem and respect unless we have our ' own self-respect , unless we stand just and firm , coveting nothing , exploiting nothing , seeking nothing to which we are not justly entitled : but having the old . indomitable spirit that gave us our country and preserved our country , and noti  --  fying all mankind that we are not decadent , but are ready to protect our own . " Mr. Hughes pointed to Mexico as an example of how international relatiore ? should not be conducted . lie declared the question of the recognition of Huerta was " beside the mark " and not an issue . I shall not detain you with any recital of those matters , which are all too familiar to your memory . " he said .. " All that I mean to emphasize at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Administration has been , in my judgment , not a policy of peace , but rather a policy involving petty and unjustiflabie warfare : and I propose that we have a policy which shall have as its cornerstone , first , that we shall not have ' a muddle of meddle . ' as Disraeli once said , but that we shall have protection of American lives and property , and the i prosecution of a consistent policy which can not fail to evoke respect while it safeguards the rights of American citizens . " Alluding again to the President Mr. Hughes i , flid ! Now , somebody rises to say , - Why , these nations have been in a very lifeand-death struggle . It is impossible that they should be able to compete with great and strong America when that struggle is over . Have they not sustained the wastes of war ? Is it possible that at a time of this sort there could be a development of any power of competition ? ' " How thoughtless such remarks are ! How self-deceited must be those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the plain facts in the case ? And it is necessary that we should consider facts , I tun talking plain sense , and it is as important for Democrats RA for Republicans that we have prosperity in the United States . " There has been an extraordinary efficiency developed abroad , and this power will be turned to production , and the products of Europe will unfailingly seek the American markets . The wages in Europe are lower than the wages paid here . The simple proposition is presented : Shall we lower American wages , or shall we protect American wages ? " We have got a condition that confronts us , and every sober student of our ' affairs realizes that American hopes , so far as they spring out of the European war and the prosperity it has created , are doomed to 1 : . e blasted when that war ends and the opportunities that sprang so suddenly depart quite as suddenly as they rose . " The message that America held , he said , should ? e this : " Come on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to get a little place where he can exploit his fellows , but rather where he can benefit his fellows by a splendid use of that talent , invigorating and stirring the enterprise of pie community .. We want managerial ability of the highest order , but we want it for service . We want the humblest workingman as well as the most talented to feel that his chance is a fair chance for service ; and we need proper rewards distributed by a community where service is the highest ideal , and where justice reigns supreme . " Mr. Hughes will leave Albany at 8 o'clock tomorrow morning and speak in cities along the Hudson Rfver , reaching New York city at 6:15 P. M. He will speak in Brooklyn tomorrow night .
