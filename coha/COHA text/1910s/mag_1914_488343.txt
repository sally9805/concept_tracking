To the unbiassed it is plain that Germany has suffered grievously since the beginning of the war in her reputation as a seat of wisdom and the abode of scientific inquiry into the truth of all matters . To all who have profited by her learning and the in  --  struction of her great teachers , this is a sor rowful thing . But it is precisely the Ger ? . man teachers of to-day who are producing a most unpleasant impression on this side of the water in their efforts to win American public opinion for their cause . Nowhere is there any evidence of a desire to undertake an unbiassed investigation of facts ; nowhere proof of a philosophical examination of re  --  cent occurrences . Logic is thrown to the winds . We are treated to a flood of rhetoric and of unsupported statements . The asser  --  tions of the Allies are flung away as unbe  --  lievable , because they are from the Allies ; the assumption being that the Germans alone are capable of telling the truth in this crisis , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but falsehood . The fail  --  ure to deal with the fundamental moral ques  --  tions from a detached , ethical point of view may be the inevitable result of the wave of patriotism that has swept over Germany , but it is none the less amazing . The world had a right , it seems to us , to expect better things , even if it could not hope for calm  --  ness in suck a national crisis . It really seems as if some of the profes  --  sors who have rushed into print to defend Germany 's cause are doing it quite as much harm as the enemy . Take , for instance , the appeal " To the Civilized World , " published by ninety-three German savants , which has just reached us . Some of the most distin  --  guished names in Germany are signed to it ? Eucken , Haeckel , Fulda , Humperdinek , Sudermann , Hauptmann , Lamprecht , ' Kaul  --  bach , Diirpfeld  --  every one notable in his field . Yet the appeal itself is discreditable to their intelligence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waive the fact that the English in which it is couched is gro  --  tesque , with merely one citation : " The iron mouth of events has proved the untruth of the fictitious German defeats , consequently misrepresentation and calumny are all the more eagerly at work . " But their statement is marked by total absence of logic . Thus they state that " it is not true that we tres  --  passed in neutral Belgium . It has been proved that France and England had resolv  --  ed on such a trespass , and it has likewise been proved that Belgium had agreed to their doing so . It would have been suicide on our part not to have been beforehand . " Thus in the first sentence they deny what they admit in the last. - As for their asser  --  tions in regard to France and England , no proof whatever is offered , or has been of  --  fered , from any source . The worst that we have discovered is the fact that England and France had planned how they would act if Germany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was a violation of neutrality for England and France to plan in advance how , if necessary , they would perform the duties put upon them by the treaty estab  --  lishing Belgian neutrality is to insult the in  --  telligence . But granting , for the sake of argument , that the contention is true , what does it boil down to ? That Germany vio  --  lated a law because some one else was go  --  ing to . If anybody was going to murder Belgian neutrality , she was going to be first at the job. , What a shocking position for moralists , for teachers of ethics and relig  --  ion to assume ! They had much better fall back openly upon the highwayman 's argument  --  ment used by the German Chancellor that he preferred the law of necessity to that laid down in a " mere scrap of paper . " Next we are told by our ninety-three men of light and leading that " it is not true that the combat against our so-called militarism is not a combat against our civilization , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not for German militarism , German civilization would long since have been extirpated . " What are we to think of all the German teachings of philosophy and religion , if this is true ? What kind of civ  --  ilization is that which rests only upon force , and how valuable is it going to be in the long run ? " Have faith in us , " the appeal concludes . Faith , yes ; but how can we have faith in their judgment hereafter ? We could cite many similarly astonishing utterances from professors that have come direct to this newspaper , in which men of internation  --  al reputation accept as facts matters for which no proof whatever is offered or can be offered . Were they to carry on their teach  --  ing or their scientific researches in any such manner they would be promptly expelled from their chairs . ' But it is not only the professors in Ger  --  many who are injuring their cause . The Brit  --  ish Government might well petition for Pro  --  fessor Munsterberg 's release from Harvard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing and speaking for Germany . There is Prof. Kuno Francke , of Harvard , too . Only a few years ago he was writing books showing a complete hostility to Kaiser , bureaucracy , and militarism Now Germany in his eyes is almost beyond criticism . Then there is Prof Eugen Kfihnemann , an ex  --  change professor from Breslau In an ad  --  dress in Boston , the other day , his assertion that Germany ought not to have violated Belgian territory , but had to do it , called forth laughter from his audience and a pointed remark from the chairman as to the professor 's irrationality . To this the agile professor promptly replied that " Americans did not seem to understand that life was al  --  ways irrational " , That Americans could only hope to understand Germany if we were situated in America as Germany is in Eu  --  rope was another of his contentions . In this crisis our learned German friends seem to fail to understand that the American is a reasoning animal who can recognize a logical absurdity when he sees one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fact . Germany , says Professor Kiihnemann. is " very much satisfied with the state civ  --  ilization has reached within her country " ; and he adds , " German militarism is the con  --  centrated power of self-defence against a world of enemies . " Might her learned men not now - take time to inquire whether all is well with a civilization that surrounds it  --  self with a world of enemies ? THE CENSORSHIP ABROAD . That the British censorship of the war news has reflected credit neither upon the intelligence of the officials nor upon their reputation for fair play is daily becoming more and more evident . It has plainly been controlled chiefly by a desire to conceal from the rest of the world the extent of any Ger  --  man successes , to blacken the enemy 's char  --  acter as much as possible , and generally to win the aid of public opinion in the United States by any means available . The censor  --  ship may not be responsible for a deliber  --  ate falsification of the official German dis  --  patch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention ; but if it is not , this merely transfers the blame to the newspapers which printed the dispatch , or to the news association which supplied it . We have rea  --  son to believe that the German press is jus  --  tified in asserting that this is not the only case inwhich official dispatches have been altered to German disadvantage . Major Red-way , in the London Globe , has charged that " we must learn to look upon the manufac  --  ture of mendacities during the war as a he  --  roic attempt to keep us going in the absence of truth . " Mr. Herbert Corey , correspondent of the New York Globe , last week flatly charged that British censors were forging dispatches , and states that Hilaire Belloc is protesting in A. weekly journal that the censorship is steadily misleading the British public . That the British reputation for manliness and square dealing towards an adversary is thus much impaired , is one of the saddest facts about the war . Englishmen have al  --  ways been held up- to our youth as model @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great war they take unfair ad  --  vantage . That the British public itself would never approve of this policy , we are certain ; but thus far British protests have naturally dwelt much less upon the dishon  --  orable side of the censorship than upon its stupidities . Of these there are no end . Thus Mr. Asquith 's first recruiting speech was not permitted to cross the ocean save frag  --  mentarily , on the perhaps correct , but none the less amazing , ground that it might hurt Great Britain abroad . Of course , being printed in full in London , it was in Germany in forty-eight hours and in New York a week later . Asquith 's speech in Dublin announc  --  ing the arrival of the Indian troops that day , Mr. Corey declares , was permitted to be printed in Ireland , but not in England ! Some of the official German dispatches were suppressed , so that the United States should not be aware of the truth , the censors being sublimely ignorant of the fact that the same dispatches were being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Associated Press filed the news of the Pope 's note to the Cardinals urging upon them prayers for peace , it was at first suppressed , and then only a few lines permitted . The excuse for suppression was that if the millions of Catholics here and elsewhere learned of the Pope 's desire for peace , it might interfere with the conduct of the war ! The stupid half-pay colonel who so ruled is to be thanked for thus making it clear how antagonistic militarism is to the Church ; but he resembled the proverbial ostrich . He quite forgot that mails from Italy reach this country . The censor in Lon  --  don apparently thinks , too . that we are not receiving the German newspapers as anti  --  dotes to his poison . He was for a long time not aware that the liberties he was taking with the Associated Press telegrams were being checked up here by the simple device of sending to New York the dispatches as filed with the censor . The discovery of any garblings or omissions was thus very easy . We sincerely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the reputation of American newspapers for honest reporting , the Asso  --  ciated Press will soon see its way clear to publishing the exact facts for the informa ? tion of the American public , which has suf  --  fered by this London narrow-mindedness and folly . That conditions have improved the last few days is , it is to be hoped , a sign of a realization that wars are not to be won by misrepresentation or by permitting the oth  --  er fellow 's alleged atrocities to be dwelt upon while your own doings are suppressed . That any ideal censorship could ever be worked out , we very much doubt , for it is founded on suppression , deceit , and conceal  --  ment ; but there are instances in which it has worked well . The difficulty lies in the censor 's inevitable tendency to drift from things military to things political , as is the case in England to-day . In France , too , there has been grave complaint that the Govern  --  ment has erred , as in 1870 , in not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Debats has recently protested at the almost complete suppression not only of news , but of intelligent discussion of the military situation . In England it is suggest  --  ed that the initial lack of popular interest in the war was due to the scarcity of news from the front . It is a fact that our own newspapers seem fuller than those in Lon  --  don , despite our remoteness . At any rate , it is difficult to keep men excited to the point of offering themselves for slaughter if there is no more thrilling news than the statement that on the twenty-seventh day of the Bat  --  tle of the Aisne the British army was getting well-accustomed to digging trenches . In Ger  --  many , they have had a strict censorship , but have given daily official bulletins , which on the whole have proved trustworthy and bear no marks of a deliberate intent to deceive , though they very often suppress when things go badly , or at least try to palliate . Their correspondents in the field are , however , grumbling , as are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government does allow full discussion by experts , and some of these are usually highly illuminat  --  ing . ELECTION FORECASTS . Both the New York Sun and World print  --  ed on Sunday - elaborate forecasts of the re  --  sults of the election next Tuesday . They relate chiefly to the control of the next Con  --  congress . That this will be retained by the Democratic party is conceded by both of the estimates . It will undoubtedly retain the Senate , probably increasing its majority there by two or three votes . But it is equal  --  ly certain that the overwhelming Democrat  --  ic preponderance in the House will be re  --  duced , the only question being by how much . In the present House the Democrats have about 160 majority over the Republicans . But this was plainly in consequence of the highly exceptional conditions in the voting of 1912 . The Progressive split allowed many Democratic Representatives to slip in who could not hope to bereturned this year . But even with a reverting to something like nor  --  mal party divisions this year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to win as many as eighty seats , which they would need to do in order to be in control of the next House . Neither of the forecasts admits the possibility that they can do it . A Republican gain of from fifty to sixty mem  --  bers is the best that can be done , according to these calculations . And they are borne out by the Tribune 's Washington correspon  --  dent , who states that " conservative esti  --  mates " at the capital indicate that the Dem  --  ocrats will control the next House , though by a " substantially reduced majority . " An aver  --  aging of the various guesses would give the Democrats a majority of from 25 to 50 . We ask no credence for these or any other figures . Carrying elections on paper and in advance is a harmless amusement , but does not beget certitude in the cautious mind . Too many beautiful election forecasts have been wrecked by the unfeeling event . What inter  --  ests us in these attempts to read the book of fate is less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of the kind that can be altered while you wait  --  than the methods of reason  --  ing employed . These may seem to be less elusive than the figures given , but we are not sure that examination will show them to be so . The first great postulate is that the Pro  --  gressive vote is to vanish like the Cheshire Cat . Only by presuming on its virtual dis  --  appearance can the Republicans even pre  --  tend to hope that they will be able to cap  --  ture the next House . But there are several uncertainties in this reckoning . The Pro  --  gressives are not , indeed , everywhere active , yet in several critical States they are doing a good deal of campaigning . They may suc  --  ceed in casting sufficient votes in a few closely contested districts to prevent Repub  --  lican candidates from winning . It is the avowed aim and hope of Col. Roosevelt to " prove to the Republicans that they ca n't win " ; and enough of his followers may be imbued with his spirit to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least the next House . Furthermore , the Republican , prophets all take it for granted that all who voted the Progressive ticket two years ago , and who have since made up their minds to abandon that new-party movement , will throw themselves into the welcoming arms of Republicans . But this does not necessar  --  ily follow . Not a few Progressives of 1912 were originally Democrats ; and if they now " go back , " it may be to their old party fold . And it is highly probable that , many former Republicans who voted for Roosevelt two years ago will now , if they are to change party allegiance once more , quietly vote in support of President Wilson . It is easy to see how either one of these suppositions as regards the effect of the Progressive vote  --  much more , all of them together  --  may viti  --  ate the election tables printed before the election . Then there is another element of great uncertainty , as it affects the minds of voters , though the preelection estimates deal with it as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the European war . It seems to be generally accepted as the salvation of the Democratic party . The Republicans say they are certain of it . But this may mean only that , in the event of Democratic suc  --  cess , they will say that they would have whipped the other party out of its boots but for the war . The process of thought , if such it can be called , is set forth at length in the Tribune . Four months ago , everything look  --  ed rosy for the Republicans . Times were not good , and the country was getting ready to give the Wilson Administration a severe rebuke at the polls . But then came the war to make business conditions " still worse . " , At that moment , however , the people altered , their attitude . That they did so " illogically , " ; the Tribune admits ; but the melancholy fact is that all the trouble caused by Democratic legislation was at once swallowed up in the immensely larger troubles due to the war , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the control of the party in power . " Ergo , the party in power is not to be punished . Ergo , Republi  --  can hopes wither . Ergo , the war was a life  --  saver to President Wilson . This little anticipatory essay in divining the popular heart is so confident as almost to carry conviction  --  especially as its conclu  --  sion goes counter to the political desires of the newspaper that produces it . And there are undeniably many surface indications in confirmation of it . We know that Democrat  --  ic candidates for Congress are appealing for votes , less on their own merits than to sup  --  port President Wilson . And in so far as this appeal is based on the feeling that the Presi  --  dent stands for peace , has thus far kept this country out of war , and may yet obtain for the United States a leading role in securing peace in Europe , its force can not be ques  --  tioned . But the fact remains that nobody can predict what will occur on November 3 . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political sentiment from de  --  claring itself so plainly as it often does . The campaign has been rather spiritless ; the reg  --  istration does not imply keen interest and the result is more than usually on the lap of the gods . AGE AND YOUTH IN POLITICS . Col. Roosevelt spoke in Ithaca last Thursday , and the venerable ex-President the compliment dispatch to the New York Sun gives this detail of their meeting each other : " I wish you were in the fight with us , " said the Colonel . " You ought to be , for you stand for what is right and decent . " Dr. White smilingly shook his head and re  --  marked : " You will come back . " Mr. Roosevelt presently took occasion to declare in his address that he would " never go back , " casting a meaning glance towards the wings of the stage where Dr. White was sitting . He added , characteristically , that what has to take place is that the Republican party must come forward . This leaves the situation , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could overcome the difficulty . If the Colonel were to march off obliquely  --  not " back , " of course  --  and the Republican party would edge forward on a bias , the two might be surprised to find that they were together again . That a kind of pathetic significance at  --  taches to this passing encounter between Andrew D. White and Theodore Roosevelt , the dullest must feel . Long friends  --  still friends in everything but politics  --  their public ways have parted . Dr. White stands for the Republicanism of the old school and the best ' type . In the days of his political activity he was as forward-looking a man as Roosevelt himself . He was eminently . the scholar in politics . With sufficient in  --  dependence , he yet managed to work with his party , serving it and being honored by it . Now he is an old man . His age is eighty-two . Col. Roosevelt is  --  well , never mind what the year-books say , he is eter  --  nally a young man . He is one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting between him and Dr. White was one be  --  tween age and youth . In the act Col. Roosevelt showed how young he is by ve  --  hemently using the word " never . " An Eng  --  lish political sage has said that no one but a very young man will use the word " never " in politics . Passing beyond the two persons in ques  --  tion , may it not be said that this exchange of greetings at Ithaca symbolizes the po  --  litical forces that have wrought party es  --  trangements ? It would be absurd to de  --  nounce Dr. White as a reactionary . He is not that any more than Col. Roosevelt is , at heart , a Jack Cade . But the two stand for different ways of looking at public questions , and for different methods of i t-taming their desired goal . The contrast is not precisely that between the conserva  --  tive and the radical . It is rather a ques  --  tion of temperament and attitude . On one side , we have the veteran of many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that which is good . On the other , we see impatience , impetuosity , a certain touch of recklessness , insisting upon cutting loose from the past and making all things new in a day . Embody these two tendencies in thousands and tens of thousands of people , and do we not get pretty close to a good explanation of the splitting away of the Pro  --  gressives from the Republican party ? The whole story is not told by adding up the years of a man 's life . It is undoubtedly true that men incline to be more conserva  --  tive as they grow older  --  though they might say that they were content with the tri  --  umph of the radical ideas of their youth . Mr. Bryce has spoken humorously of a Radi  --  cal Club which was formed in England some fifty years ago . Every one of its flaminte agitators that lived any length of time be  --  came a fine old crusted Tory . But the rule does not always work that way . Gladstone was a stern and unbending Tory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and suc  --  cessively took up such novel political doc  --  trines , down to extreme old age , that he came to be called the " Old Man in a Hurry " ? in a hurry , that is , to revolutionize Eng  --  land before lie died . It is not the calendar , but the spirit , that signifies If Theodore Roosevelt lives to be eighty , can anybody imagine him warming his shrunk hands by the fire while he discourses on the degen , eracy of the times and the inconceivable folly of upstart boys setting out to reform the nation ? Obviously , the hopes of any political party for the future must be pinned to its young men . It was long the boast of the Repub  --  licans that they were steadily attracting the pick of American youth . There was a de  --  cided break in this tendency in 1874-76 , when there was such a turning of young men in our colleges and elsewhere to the hope of needed reforms through the Demo  --  cratic party . Grover Cleveland won even a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Progressives have taken great and justifiable pride in the large proportion of young recruits who rallied to the Roose  --  velt banner . But if youth is ardent and aspiring , it also has a kind of impatience that easily lapses into instability and fickle  --  ness . Often it can not face and endure the prolonged struggle . It wants short-cuts to victory ; and if they are nowhere in sight , it is apt to fall away . And the ominous shrinkage in the Progressive registration and vote , all over the country , together with the lists of open desertions of the party , now so extended , indicates that the spell over the young men is being broken . The thoughts of youth are , indeed , long , long thoughts , but the thought of 1916 , possibly 1920 , with the leader steadily aging , is evidently a bit too long . THE LIGHTER SIDE OF SCHOOL LIFE . A series of sketches which the humorist , Ian Hay , has been publishing in Blackivood 's under the above title , has more than anec @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy the father of the man . The spirit of the English public schools has been the theme of energetic quarrelling ; but between Rud  --  yard Kipling , whose " Stalky &; Co. " our own Roosevelt denounced as brutal , and Dean Farrar , whose " St. Winifred 's " and " Eric ; or , Little by Little " touch depths of bathetic priggishness , " Tom Brown at Rugby " strikes a credible mean , and expresses , with books like " A Day of My Life at Eton " and Mr. Hay 's sketches , what may fairly be taken as the characteristics of young Englishmen in those little republics . Mr. Ray expresses the dominant quality as a dislike for men  --  tal cleverness coupled with " worship of force of character . " " It is not good form to ap  --  pear deeply interested in anything , or to hold any serious views about anything , or possess any special knowledge about any  --  thing . " The youth who can easily excel in sports and studies is admired , but the youth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Sixth , for example , drunk the night before examinations , but prize-winner nevertheless . " On Sunday af  --  ternoons he would disappear upon a long country walk , ostentatiously exhibiting a cigarette case . In reality he sat behind a hedge in an east wind and translated De  --  mosthenes . " He is the man , also , who af  --  fects to fall asleep in class , but in reality is mentally pulling and polishing his Latin hexameters . Even more than he hates to seem to strive after intelligence and effi ciency , the English boy hates to boast of what he has done . These same qualities , but as real and not assumed , an American writer in the Hibbert Journal last year emphasized as distinguish  --  ing the mature Englishman  --  indifference and mental bluntness , growing out of an emphasis upon moral over intellectual excel  --  lences . It is at any rate clear that the young American 's school life centres in very different ideals . The Briton calls his fellow who becomes a good cricketer by hours and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amer  --  ican , on the other hand , as to the Scotch-man , success is far too important a thing to be jeopardized by false modesty . The competition is as overt as it is strenuous , in class and out of it . The rowing crew is assembled and practiced , under driving coaches , a year beforehand , and the football team works in field and gymnasium , night and day , until by practice it evolves a per  --  fect combination . The American is too in  --  tent on his goal to understand the English pose , just as the English boy has a vague feeling that such pains are unsportsman  --  like . This seriousness and democratic keen  --  ness of American school effort may even seem to expel all lightness and color from its life , but only to those who lack true per  --  spective . Comradeship , love of a good time , the enjoyment of give and take , are as real in one part of the Anglo-Saxon world as in another . The American motto is simply " thorough , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work silently . But there is probably a fundamental difference in the fact that the English boy has sought moral character , before and after Arnold , as much as the American has always sought a sort of business efficiency . In some ways the spirit of school life is so identical with the national spirit that it is impossible to speak of its features as re  --  sponsible for the graduate . Convention , for example , is a fixed element in the whole British social system ; and no one can read Thomas Hughes without noting how strong  --  ly it checked intellectual initiative at Rug  --  by . The most energetic character is the boy who has been identified as Dean Stanley , and it is not his mind , but his unconvention  --  al conscience and rare moral courage , that gave him energy . It is thus in school and out . The Briton minds his own business and dislikes undertaking a responsibility not his own . He is always a man who sticks to his own form ; but his sense of duty is such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vinced that a task is indubitably his , he-will undertake it at no matter what sacrifice . Chronicle of the War The English and French critics who , rather more than two weeks ago , after the fall of Antwerp , saw the tide of Ger  --  man success at its flood and confidently prophesied that presently it would ebb , may , if they will , take this comfort to themselves in any event  --  that in a sense they are bound to win , for even should the German armies ultimately triumph the German experts , generals , and professors who wrote glibly of " the next war " will have been convicted of erroneous judgment . In the view of these experts the very cornerstone of German success in that hypothetical war was a lightning-like offensive which should crush the enemies of the Fatherland individually and before they could command their full re  --  sources . Failure to achieve this result would , according to the experts , involve failure of the German cause . Now , as we approach the end of the third month of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to declare that the plan which von Bernhardi and other German mil  --  itary experts considered vital to success has failed . This does not , of course , mean that Germany is even within measurable distance of losing the war , but it would mean that if the German experts were right . It may be well at this time to give a brief r  --  sum ? of what has happened . After the preliminary stages of the war in Belgium , where the resistance of the Belgian army de  --  layed the German advance for three weeks and gave the Allies much-needed time for concentration , the general advance on Paris began with the retreat of the British from Mons on August 24 By September 2 the Germans were at Creil , only thirty miles from Paris . Then Gen. Joffre launched the army of Gen. d'Arnade against von Kluck 's army on the German right . Simultaneously , as has since become plain , the army of the Crown Prince on the left was in difficulties . The battle of the Marne was followed by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from September 5 to September 12 , to the Aisne . The taking up of the defensive position be  --  tween Soissons and Verdun may be consider  --  ed to have marked definitely the termination of the first great German offensive . Desperate efforts were made at various points on the line to resume the offensive , but attacks were met with counter-attacks , and on the whole we may regard the fighting on the Aisne as having resolved itself into the mainte  --  nance of a powerful German defensive . Meanwhile we have the caterpillar-like ex  --  tension of the two lines of battle from Noyon in a northerly direction up into Belgium , the Allies making constant efforts to outflank the German right wing , the Germans constantly extending their line to keep pace with the Allied advance , and both sides ever bringing up new reinforcements . With the prospect of the Allied line creeping towards Antwerp and joining hands with the troublesome Belgian army in that city , the German General Staff abandoned altogether its original plan of a direct sweep from the Belgian boundary down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Antwerp on September 28 we may date the initiation of a second great offensive movement .
