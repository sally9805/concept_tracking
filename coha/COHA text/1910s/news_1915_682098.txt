txt SECTARIAN TEACHING . The Danger of Emphasizing Difference of Belief Among Children . May I add another word of protest against the installation of the Gary system into our schools ? While theoretically it may be a great improvement on the present methods In use , to me it seems but fomenting strong religious and race antagonism to bring religion Into the schools , or rattier bring the schools Into religion Surely , we do not wish to foster racial bitterness in the minds of children . Why not add ethics to our own curriculum ? Why could not children be instructed in morals without the necessity of drawing a distinct line between the children of various sects ? Catholics stand and go to the right ; all Protestants go here : all Baptists go there ; all sews to the left , arc . The Board of Education must not allow sectarian teaching in the schools ; it must avoid any shadow of complicity in proselytizing . Why draw attention to differences in belief , rather than to hold all together by one strong moral bond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In this time of worldwide bitterness and antagonism , realize the necessity of holding our youth together by a strong union of purpose and ideals , not by creating new religious differences such as would be created by this Gary system of sending children to various places outelde the school and the home for their religious and moral instruction during school hours .
