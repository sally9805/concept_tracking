 | It is a strange fact that what are undoubtedly the world 's two most ancient and opulent seats of empire , the valley of the Nile and the valley of the TigrisEuphrates ? and it is still a moot question among archeologists as to which was the original cradle of civilization ? should both have ultimately become two of the dreariest and most sterile of the world 's deserts . But stranger still is it that when , after the lapse of a score or more of centuries , the destined hour of their rehabilitation again came round , the master transformer of each in changes that will restore both valleys to a fruitfulness undreamed of by Rameses or Nebuchadnezzar should be one and the same man , and he not a king nor an emperor , but a quiet , unassuming Englishman , with the practical brain of an engineer and the imaginative soul of a dreamer . It is as a dreamer ? a constructive dreamer , in fact ? that I like best to think of Sir William Willcocks , and I can find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as do those which Kipling wrote after the death of that other great " Forwarder of Destinies , " Cecil Rhodes . Dreamer devout , by vision led Beyond our guess or reach , The travail of his spirit bred Cities in place of speech . In Egypt the dreams of Sir William Willcocks have been transformed into realities . With the completion of the hightened Assuan Dam , and the other projects now well advanced , the reclamation of all of the Nile Valley that can be effected with the present flow of that river may be said to be accomplished . In Mesopotamia the transformation has only just begun . Save for casual references to it in Bushire and Bussorah , my acquaintance with the Mesopotamian reclamation scheme dates from a certain June evening in the Bagdad Club library , when , with a volume of the Arabian Nights in my hand , I sought out a reclining chair under a punkah and found on the arm of the former a copy of Sir William Willcocks 's report on the feasibility of irrigating the Tigris-Euphrates Valley . I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Haroun al Raschid thru the highways and byways of the ancient city of the Kaliphs ; but I chanced to start turning the leaves of the reclamation report , and instead of trailing at the skirts of the good Haroun , I found the car of my fancy hitched to the Pegasus of Sir William Willcocks and whirled off across the ages to the days of the Garden of Eden , swung back in a sweeping circle thru the deluge , the rise and fall of Chaldea and Babylon , Assyria and Hitt , on down to the present and beyond to that future , a decade or so hence , when the transmuting touch of water is to restore all that is worth restoring of the glories that have gone before . It was with Willcocks , the dreamer , that I rode that night . Twenty-four hours later , with a cleareyed , sun-tanned Scotchman , I stood at the awninged window of a drafting room looking down into a quarter-mile wide hole where a couple of thousand Arab laborers and a confused mixture of pumps , engines , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preliminary work for the foundation of the great $20,000,000 Hindia Barrage , which is to raise the level of the Euphrates and turn it back into its old channel by the walls of Babylon . Opened between us and supplemented by a portfolio of maps lay a green-bound report similar to the one I had found on the arm of my chair at the Bagdad Club the night before , and my companion turned often and read from it as he pointed and explained . But always it was columns of figures ? estimates of flow and fall and siltage content ? that he quoted ; those magic pages  | glowing with fascinating interweavings of fact and fancies regarding Eden and the deluge and Belshazzar and Sardanapalus were unturned . " And would you believe it ? " ( my companion , Percy Warbrick , the resident engineer , was speaking ) , " in spite of the trouble we have had from strikes , floods , non-delivery of materials and the faulty character of some of the brick , Sir William 's estimates of cost and time are working out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the engineer , not the dreamer , whom we followed that afternoon ; the engineer transforming into realities the visionings of the dreamer . To the traveler in the desert of Lower Mesopotamia there are two characteristic and constantly recurring landmarks : one the tel or mound which marks the ruins of an ancient city , and the other an apparently endless earth wall , like a railway embankment or a dike , which marks either side of the line of the old canals . Both tel and canal banks are encountered over a great area of country , their limits defining , in fact , the boundaries of the heart of the old Babylonian Empire . Nothing so extensive as the old Babylonian canal system has been known in history ; a circumstance due , perhaps , quite as much to the facility with which the country and its rivers lent themselves to the construction of an efficient scheme of irrigation as to the skill of the Babylonians as engineers . The works of a number of ancient peoples ? among others , those of certain of the North American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do those of the Babylonians , but , as none of them had so favorable a field of endeavor as the Tigris-Euphrates Valley , their ultimate achievements were less striking . It is not known definitely whether the downfall of the Babylonian Empire was due to the failure of its complicated irrigation system , without which its dense population could not exist , or whether the failure of the irrigation system was due to the downfall of the empire as a result of its own weakness or the attacks of the Medes and Persians . At any rate ,  | page deleted  | long experience in curbing the eccentricities of the Nile , the imperative necessity of providing some sort of a flood escape for the surplus waters of both the Tigris and Euphrates must have been apparent at once , and his first attention , after being commissioned by the Turkish Government to outline a plan for the reclamation of Mesopotamia , was directed to this end . Investigations were first made on the Euphrates , and , guided by the presence of a broad belt of shells in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shiah sect of the Mohammedans ? a great depression having an area of 500 square miles and a depth of 50 feet , capable of receiving a flow vastly in excess of any recorded flood of modern times , was discovered and surveyed . The belt of shells and traces of old canals and diversion works point strongly to the fact that this dePENDENT August 21 pression was utilized by the ancients to the identical end it will serve when the Habbania Escape , now under construction on the Euphrates , is completed . This work , which is in the hands of a prominent British contractor , will doubtless approximate in steel and concrete what the ancients built for the same purpose of bitumen and sun-dried brick . This project will be completed inside of another year , after which the way will be clear to take up systematically the canalization of the great area the Hindia Barrage alone will command 1,360,000 acres ? which is to be irrigated from the water of the Euphrates . The handling of the flood waters of the Tigris , which , altho having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above the maximum flow of the latter in the spring time , is a more difficult problem . There are two alterna- tive solutions , one being to utilize as an escape an extensive salt sink to the southwest of Samara , in which the River Tarthar now discharges and terminates , and the other the simpler plan of abandoning the left bank of the river to the floods and creating a massive canal and dike along the right bank . The principal objection to the escape project is its cost , it being estimated that at least $30,000 , - 000 would be required for the two dams for raising the Tigris the necessary 25 feet above flood level and for the canal . Trouble with the great Shamnar tribe of nomad Arabs would also be sure to follow the invasion of their grazing grounds by the overflow lake . Willcocks 's provisional recommendation is in favor of the project involving the abandonment of one side of the river , leaving the construction of an escape to a time when more money is available than at present . With the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for bringing the lower valley under canal may be taken up as fast as the Turkish Government will provide the money , the prospects of which , it is needless to say , have not been improved by the heavy drains made upon the imperial treasury as a result of the two late wars . These projects , a score or more in number , when completed , will have brought water not only to all of the country irrigated by the Babylonians , but also to many hundreds of square miles that did not exi.4. at the time of Nebuchadnezzar ? land built out into what was then the Persian Gulf by the silt-laden rivers . It may be of interest to note in this connection that the waters of both Tigris and Euphrates carry five times as much solid deposit as do those of the Nile , as a result of which considerable difficulty will doubtless be experienced in keeping the canals , once they are constructed , from becoming clogged with silt . The lack of effective means of doing this has been responsible for the  | abandonment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with modern knowledge and devices , however , the only menace of silt lies in the expense of removing it fast enough to keep the ditches clear . The canals to irrigate the country northwest of Bagdad will be taken off above a barrage proposed to be erected near the site of the ancient Nimroud 's Dam . Another barrage will be built at Koot to make a permanent canal of the Kai branch of the river ; and still further down , at the junction of the Tigris and Euphrates ? the traditional site of the Garden of Eden ? regulating works , dikes and canals will be built to reclaim the lands between Khar Abdalla and the thriving port of Bussorah , thirty miles from the head of the Persian Gulf . A fairly extensive but relatively cheap piece of reclamation is projected at the great loop of the Tigris , twenty miles below Bagdad , where a quarter of a mile wide neck of land separates two points on the river that are thirty miles apart by its winding channel . A two or three meter fall gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? about 250,000 acres ? under canal , but the consummation of this project must almost inevitably result in the destruction of the ruins of the great Ctesiphon , a ruin of one of the Mesopotamian Kaliphates which is famed thruout the world as having the largest arch ever constructed . As a sacrifice to reclamation it is not unworthy to rank with the famous Egyptian temple of Philae , the days of which are believed to be numbered as a result of raising the Assuan Dam . The Hindia Barrage , to which I have referred , was the first of the great Willcocks projects to be undertaken , because it was possible to proceed with it regardless of the completion of the Habbania Escape , which is to dispose of the flood waters of the Euphrates and upon which all the other projects must wait . The dam at Hindia is designed to turn a large part of the flow of the Euphrates into the old Babylon channel , restoring to cultivation hundreds of thousands of acres which had reverted to desert thru the silting up of the former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing  | twenty years ago by erecting a low weir across the river a short distance below the site of the present barrage . This structure , which was built entirely of bricks quarried from the ruins of the Tower of Babel , the palace of Belshazzar and other historic buildings of Babylon , did good service while it lasted , the water in the old channel being raised to a level which made it possible to bring a considerable part of the abandoned area again under cultivation . It began going to pieces in the first heavy flood , however , and , thru the heavy losses suffered by those who opened up new land only to be compelled to abandon it as the water in the old channel sank back to its former level , was ultimately responsible for more harm than good . On the completion of the Hindia Barrage archeology is destined to offer to reclamation what will probably be recorded as the greatest sacrifice of all , for the raising of the water in the old Euphrates channel must inevitably preclude forever the possibility of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has worked in or studied this part of Asia , the uncovering of the prehistoric city which the excavations of the German mission has proven to be buried beneath the ruins of Babylon itself . When I visited Dr. Koldeway and his coworkers last June the clearly defined walls of a great structure of this unguessed capital had been uncovered directly beneath the foundations of the palace of Nebuchadnezzar , but even at that time the seepage from the almost stagnant pools in the old Euphrates made heavy pumping necessary , and the rise of water following the completion of the barrage at Hindia will make further work at any considerable depth out of the question . Doubtless there are many who will deem the price too heavy ; but to the average " citizen of the world " half a million live and prosperous farmers would weigh rather more heavily in the balance of expediency than a row of cases filled with the bones and ornaments of dead men and a tome filled with theories regarding life in a dead city . The only serious hitch in the progress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reclamation in history is one that may arise thru the inability of the Turkish Government to provide the money as fast as it is needed , and this hinges on so many contingencies that are still swinging in the balance that it would profit little to discuss the question here . From the standpoint of all concerned ? the Turk included ? it is unfortunate that the whole work of reclaiming Mesopotamia could not have been turned over to British concessionaries , just as that of building the Bag- dad Railway was given to Germans . In that event one could have said just as confidently that the first and greatest step toward the restoration of the Garden of Eden ? the construction of the irrigation works ? would be a fait accompli by 1920 , as he may say today that trains will be running from the Bosporus to the Persian Gulf by 1918 . This plan would have also insured the stiffening of the ' framework of the administrative system by running thru it a strong reinforcement of British brains and experience , and , what is quite as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kind which seems to be inherent in the Anglo-Indian civil servant . It is these three things which are jointly responsible for the fact that the irrigation projects of India are paying 7 1/2 per cent a year , and that the colonies which they have made possible are the most prosperous and contented in the empire . It will be a difficult matter to find Ottoman subjects with either the brains of the experience for the great work in hand , and as for humanitarianism ? but one can hardly write the word in the same sentence with Turkish official . I regret that the space at my command has made it impossible to make more than casual reference to the Bagdad Railway , a project the consummation of which is only less important to Mesopotamian reclamation than the construction of the irrigation works themselves . Each is essential and complementary to the other , for the railway can not pay unless it serves a fruitful and developed country , while no purpose would be served in developing a country that was unprovided with efficient transportation facilities . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non to success , because of the fact that the Willcocks irrigation works will ultimately put an end to the navigation of the Tigris , thereby closing the present trade route to Europe by way of the Persian Gulf . Active construction work has been in progress for over a year at half a dozen points along the proposed line , and there is every reason to hope that broad gauge connection between Bussorah or Koweit and Konia , in Asia Minor , will be made some time in 1917 . Meissner Pasha , the talented German who is general manager of the company that is building the road , with his thirty years ' experience in Turkey , has done for the railways of that empire what Sir William Willcocks has accomplished for irrigation in Egypt ; and by the time a restored Garden of Eden has become a matter of history his part in the task will entitle his name to a place on the portal below only that of the great British engineer .               @ @ @ @ @ @
