SCENE  --  The sitting-room of Edward Brown 's home in Bridgetown , Conn . To the left in the foreground a door leading into the dining room . Farther back a book-case and two windows looking out on the back yard . In the corner an expensive Victrola machine with cabinet for records . In the middle of the far side of the room is a huge old-fashioned fire-place with brass andirons . On either side of the fire-place a window opening on the garden . In the right hand corner near the window a Morris chair . Farther forward a large doorway leading to the parlor with two sliding doors which are tightly drawn together , it being neither Sunday nor a holiday . Still farther in the foreground a smaller door opening on the hallway . Above the fire-place a mantel on the center of which is a Mission clock with a bright brass pendulum . The remainder of the mantel is taken up by cigar boxes , a skull-and-cross-bones tobacco jar , a brass match safe , etc . A square table with four or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the large sober-colored rug which covers all but the edge of the hard-wood floor . On the table a stack of magazines and a newspaper , also an embroidered center-piece , the fringe of which can be seen peeking out from under the shining base of an electric reading lamp wired from the chandelier above . Two stiff looking chairs have been used to fill up floor spaces which must have seemed unduly bare to the mistress of the household . The walls are papered a dull blurred crimson . This monotony of color is at well-regulated intervals monotonously relieved by pretentiously stupid paintings of the " Cattle-at-the-Stream " , " Sunrise-on-the-Lake " variety . These daubs are imprisoned in ornate gilt frames . The room is sufficiently commonplace and ordinary to suit the most fastidious Philistine . Just at present it 's ugliness is shamelessly revealed by the full downward glare of the reading lamp and the searching stare of all four bulbs on the chandelier . It is about eight o'clock on a hot evening in September of the present day . All the windows are open . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are discovered seated by the table . Mrs. Brown is a small grey-haired , tired-looking woman about fifty years old , neatly dressed in black . Her expression is meek and when she speaks the tone of her voice apologizes for the unseemly indulgence . Brown himself is a tall , lean old man with a self-satisfied smile forever on his thin lips . He is smooth-shaven , a trifle bald , fifty-eight years old , and dressed as becomes a leading citizen . Edward is tall and stout , pudgy-faced , dark-haired , small of eye , thick of lip and neck . He is dressed exactly as a small-town alderman should be dressed and is thirty years old . BROWN ( laying aside the newspaper he has been reading ) I do n't think much of that " ad " you 've got in here , Ed. p. 3 EDWARD ( solemnly deferential ) What 's the matter with it , Father ? ( with dignity ) I wrote it myself . BROWN ( dryly ) I know you did . I can see you sticking out all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifeless , in other words . EDWARD My desire was to appeal to the better class of people in the town  --  the people whose patronage is really worth while and  --  BROWN Stop right there . You 're running a hardware store , not a cotillion . The people you 've got to appeal to are the people who want something we 've got and have the money to pay for it . No other distinction goes in our business . EDWARD But I thought it would be an asset to get and hold the trade of the best people . BROWN It is n't as much of an asset as getting and holding the trade of the working people . They pay cash . While the others  --  I 'd never have to hire a collector if it was n't for those same best people . Keep your social high-flying out of the store . It 's no place for it . ( with asperity ) Remember I have n't retired yet and , although God knows I 've earned it , I never will be able to if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after this before you appeal to the best people . p. 4 EDWARD ( sullenly ) I 'll have the " ad " taken out tomorrow and you can write another yourself . BROWN ( more kindly ) No , write it yourself . You know how to do it when you want to . ( with a sly smile ) Forget you 're an alderman for a few minutes . Keep your speeches for the Board of Common Council . Remember your father was a working man and a farm hand , and all the education he 's got beyond grammar school he picked up along the way . Write an " ad " which would appeal to him if he had five dollars and needed some kitchen utensils . EDWARD ( shocked  --  considering his father 's acknowledgement of his humble origin a grave social error ) You have risen beyond all such comparisons . BROWN Do n't be so sure of me . Well , do n't forget about that " ad . " Anything else new ? EDWARD N-no ; but there is another matter not directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over seriously with you . BROWN Fire away . You 've got the floor , Alderman . EDWARD ( ponderously ) It 's about John . BROWN What 's John done ? p. 5 EDWARD Well , it 's like this , Father . Harry and I , and I am sure the girls will agree with us , think it is rather hard John should so obviously be made the pet of the family . High school was good enough for any of us but you sent him through four years at Princeton . You have always told us you considered a college education more of a hindrance than a help to a man 's success in life , and yet you allowed John to take up a classical course  --  a gentleman 's course , as they call it , which will certainly be of little use to him if he goes into business . BROWN ( frowning ) And who said he was to go into business ? I always clearly stated I intended John for one of the professions . We 've got enough business men in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of taking up a profession . BROWN ( hesitatingly ) It 's been sort of a secret between your mother , John , and myself , but since you bring the matter up I might as well tell you I 've decided he shall go to law school . There 's plenty of opportunity here for a young lawyer with position and money to back him up  --  of that I 'm certain . Thanks to you and Harry the business I 've built up will be well taken care of if anything should happen to me , and I see no reason for placing John in it ; especially as his talents seem to run in another direction . p. 6 EDWARD ( suppressing the indignation he feels at this fresh favor shown his younger brother ) Perhaps you are right , sir . I confess I am no judge of what future would best suit John . He never speaks of himself or his plans to me , or , for that matter , to any of us except Bessie , and she seems to treat whatever he tells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me was the fact that you had never asked John to work during any of his vacations . ( While he is speaking Harry enters from the hall . He is a tall , dark , pleasant-looking young fellow of twenty-five with the good-natured air and breezy manners of a **26;2538;TOOLONG . A bit of a sport , given to beer drinking , poker parties and kelly pool , if the foppish mode of his light check clothes be any criterion . ) HARRY ( who has caught his brother 's remark about vacations ) Good evening people . Go to it , Ed . ( He goes over and takes a chair near the table . ) EDWARD ( not relishing the interruption ) I was just explaining to Father how we feel about John not helping us in any way . HARRY I got part of what you said . On the level , Father , it is n't square for us to toil and sweat while our fair young brother pulls that lily of the field stuff . ( He says this with the air of getting off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your vulgar slang for your barroom companions and do n't play the fool when you come home . You perform well enough outside without any rehearsals . If you ca n't talk sense , do n't say anything . ( Harry accepts this reprimand with a smile . ) What was it you were saying , Ed ? EDWARD I was saying that while Harry and I and the girls , too , have been working at something ever since we left high school , you have never even suggested that John help in any way . BROWN I intend to put him in some law office during the summers in which he 's in law school . HARRY Law school ? EDWARD ( bitterness in his tones ) Yes , John is going to law school this fall . Father just told me . HARRY Why be peeved ? Every family in town has a lawyer in it that can afford the luxury . Why not us ? But you 'll have a hard time making John approve of your scheme . He does n't want to be a lawyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painter . EDWARD ( stolidly ) There is room for a good painting business in this town with all the new summer homes being built along the shore . HARRY ( with a laugh ) Not that kind of a painter , you nut . He 's too much high-brow for houses . Portraits of the Four Hundred would be more in his line . p. 8 BROWN I tell you he wants to be a lawyer . His painting 's only something to take up spare time . HARRY All his time is spare time . ( His father looks at him angrily and Harry hastily changes the subject . ) Where is the subject of this elevating discussion this evening ? MRS . BROWN ( looking up from her knitting ) You mean John ? He 's over at the Steele 's for dinner . ( Edward looks glum and Harry glances meaningly at him with a tantalizing smile . ) HARRY Romeo and Juliet had nothing on those two . Why so pensive , Edward ? EDWARD I was thinking  --  HARRY You surprise me , Alderman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ass , Harry . HARRY ( meekly ) Thank you , dear brother . ( He turns to his mother . ) Mother , when are the glad tidings to be made public ? You ought to be in the secret . MRS . BROWN You mean about Maud and John ? HARRY Yes ; Ed and I are anxious to know in time to dust off the old frock coats and not disgrace ourselves . p. 9 MRS . BROWN I wish I could tell you . I do hope it will come about , I 'm sure . Maud is such a nice sensible girl , she would make a lovely wife . HARRY Not forgetting the fact that her dear daddy is overburdened with coin and she 's an only child ; and remembering that the Steeles are socially spotless . Ask Edward if I speak not truth . He doped it all out for himself once , did n't you , Ed ? ( in tones of great sadness ) But that was long , long ago  --  almost a year . And , alas , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father , I appeal to you to inform Harry there are feelings he should respect and not make the butts of his vulgar jokes . My  --  er  --  former affection for Miss . Steele is one of them . Though I have never told anyone but this ( glaring at Harry ) would-be humorist ,  --  and that in a moment of foolish confidence I shall never cease to regret  --  HARRY ( interrupting him with soft approach ) Oh , Edward ! You forced the confidence on me . You were in liquor , Edward . You had been drinking heavily . I can remember vividly to this day how grieved I was to see you in such a state  --  you  --  a pillar of the church ! MRS . BROWN Harry ! BROWN What ! p. 10 EDWARD ( his face red with shame ) I must acknowledge to my shame that what Harry says about my  --  er  --  condition at the time is not wholly unwarranted . He exaggerates , greatly exaggerates , but  --  HARRY You were so sad . You wept on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bought . MRS . BROWN Oh , Harry ! ( Brown is smiling . ) EDWARD I have to confess I had a great deal too much to drink . ( pompously ) It was the first time in my life such a thing has happened and I promise you it will be the last . HARRY That 's what they all say . ( Edward glowers at him . ) All right , I 'm going . ( He turns round at the door to hurl a parting shot . ) My feelings are too much for me . I can not bear to hear the harrowing tale of my elder brother 's shame a second time . I will go out in the garden and weep a little . ( He goes out . Edward wears an expression of patient martyrdom . Brown with difficulty hides his impulse to laugh outright . ) BROWN Tut , tut , do n't be so serious . You know Harry . What if you were a bit under the weather ? It 's a good man 's fault  --  once in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my life when I was three sheets in the wind celebrating one thing or another . p. 11 EDWARD ( stiffy ) I have never approved of intoxicants in any form . It was a shocking deviation from my principles . ( firmly ) It shall never happen again . ( Brown can not hide a smile . Edward is piqued . ) I beg of you , Father , to believe what I say . My one lapse  --  er  --  I was upset , terribly upset , by Miss . Steele 's refusal to become my wife and  --  BROWN ( in amazement ) You asked Maud to marry you ! MRS . BROWN Good gracious ! EDWARD ( nettled that they should think such a thing strange ) Why do you seem so surprised ? I flatter myself I was in a better position to take care of a wife than my brother John is now . BROWN I was n't thinking about that . I was surprised neither your mother nor I had ever suspected anything of the kind . Now that I come to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Steele 's a lot of the time . MRS . BROWN ( flabbergasted by this piece of news ) Who 'd ever dream of such a thing ! EDWARD Maud  --  Miss . Steele did not definitely refuse me . She said she was too young to marry . However she gave me to understand she had already bestowed her affections on someone else . p. 12 BROWN Did old man Steele know anything of all this ? EDWARD Certainly . I thought it my duty to inform him of my intentions before I spoke to his daughter . He did not seem displeased with the idea but left the matter entirely to Maud  --  er  --  Miss . Steele , with the result I have just made known to you . MRS . BROWN ( not able to recover from her astonishment ) You 're the last one I ever thought would fall in love , Ed . EDWARD Please do not harp on that point , Mother . I am quite human though you do not appear to think so . BROWN ( thoughtfully ) So that 's how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of things . EDWARD I do not understand you . BROWN I mean your sudden interest in John and your desire to see him improving his time at the store instead of at the Steele 's EDWARD ( flushing ) Do you mean to accuse me of vulgar jealousy because I still take enough interest in Miss . Steele 's welfare to be unwilling my brother should compromise her ? ( While he is speaking his two sisters , Mary and Bessie , enter from the hall . Mary is a thin , angular woman with a long face and sharp features . She is twenty-eight years old but looks older , wears spectacles , and is primly dressed in a plain , black gown as unfashionable as she considers respectable . ( Bessie is as attractive as Mary is plain . Small , plump , with a mass of wavy black hair and great hazel eyes , a red , pouting , laughing mouth , glowing complexion , and small restless hands and feet , Bessie is quite adorable . She is twenty-three years old , one year older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 13 BROWN I said nothing about jealousy , Ed . It must have been your conscience you heard . ( Edward grows confused . ) BESSIE ( goes over to her mother and kisses her saying ) We walked up to the post-office . ( Mary sits down in one of the straight-backed chairs near Edward and breaks right into the subject in discussion . ) MARY ( her voice raspy and monotonous ) I must say I agree with Ed , Father . It 's the talk of the town the way John is tagging after Maud Steele . BROWN Bosh ! The town 's always gossiping about something . MARY And I do think it 's high time John put his education to some use . We all have to work at something  --  even Bessie is a stenographer  --  and I do n't see why he should n't . BESSIE Goodness , why do n't you leave John alone ? He 's been working all summer at his painting . ( Edward gives a scornful grunt . ) You do n't think that 's work because he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'd be ashamed , Ed , running him down the way you do . Your real reason is just jealousy because Mauds in love with him . You ought to be more of a man . EDWARD You are very unjust , Bessie , and you do n't know what you 're talking about . I merely want to see John do the right thing for all our sakes . p. 14 MARY I do n't think Mr. Steele will ever consent to Maud 's being married so young . I know if I were he I would never approve of it . A young girl of twenty is altogether too young to think of marriage . HARRY ( entering suddenly from the hall  --  mockingly ) But it 's better to be married too soon than not at all , is n't it , Sister ? ( Mary favors him with a terrible look . He grins back at her . ) Still holding the inquest ? Then allow me to announce that the subject of this debate has just entered the house . ( He turns around and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't keep the court waiting . ( Bessie giggles . ) Thanks , Bessie . Thank God , I am not wholly unappreciated . ( John enters , smiling bashfully , his face flushed and excited . They all greet him in embarrassed tones . He is an altogether different type from the other members of the family ; a finer , more sensitive organization . In appearance he is of medium height , wiry looking and graceful in his flannel clothes of unmistakable college cut . His naturally dark complexion has been burnt to a gold bronze by the sun . His hair , worn long and brushed straight back from his forehead , is black , as are his abnormally large dreamer 's eyes , deep-set and far apart in the oval of his face . His mouth is full lipped and small , almost weak in it 's general character ; his nose straight and thin with the nostrils of the enthusiast . When he experiences any emotion his whole face lights up with it . In the bosom of his own family and in the atmosphere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of place. ) p. 15 HARRY ( in a nasal drawl ) Prisoner at the bar , you are accused  --  BROWN For God 's sake , stop your chatter for a moment . Sit down , John . ( John takes a chair by the table . ) JOHN ( in pleasant tones  --  to Harry ) Well , what am I accused of ? HARRY Mary and Edward accuse you of being a flagrant member of the Idle Rich Class . MARY Oh ! EDWARD A joke 's a joke but  --  BROWN Be still , sir ! ( protests from the court ) MRS . BROWN Harry ! JOHN ( clasping and unclasping his hands nervously ) I suppose it would be hopeless to enter a plea before this court that trying to express oneself in paint is a praiseworthy occupation which should be encouraged . I have to acknowledge being salaryless and I guess the best thing to do to save the court 's time is plead guilty . EDWARD ( ponderously ) I think this joke has gone far enough and we ought to explain to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jumps in his chair . ) Alderman , you are liable to fine for contempt . p. 16 EDWARD ( sputtering ) Harry  --  you are a fool ! HARRY You made that remark once before , Alderman . Do n't repeat your statements . You 're not running for office now . EDWARD I  --  I  --  I ( He looks as if he meditated assault and battery . ) JOHN ( nervously , not relishing this form of entertainment ) Come back to me , Harry . What else am I accused of ? HARRY Mother accuses you of contemplated theft . ( John is puzzled and embarrassed . The others raise a storm of protest . ) BROWN ( severely ) You should n't say such a thing even if you are only joking . Explain what you mean . HARRY How can I when you make so much noise ? Prisoner , Mother insists that you are planning to purloin from one of our most respected citizens  --  his only daughter ! ( All laugh except Edward . John grows red with confusion and smiles foolishly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JOHN I 'm afraid I 'll have to plead guilty to that , too  --  not only to the intention but to the actual deed itself . p. 17 MARY ( sharply ) You mean Maud has accepted you ? JOHN Yes . ( They all crowd around him showering him with congratulations . The women kiss him , Harry claps him on the back , Brown shakes his hand . Edward mutters a few conventional phrases but is unable to hide his mortification . ) EDWARD ( coldly , taking his watch out and looking at it ) I am sorry to have to leave all of you on such a joyful occasion but ( importantly ) I have an engagement at the club with Congressman Whitney which I can not very well ignore . ( swelling out with dignity ) He said he wished to confer with me on a matter of grave importance . So I hope you will excuse me . Good night , everyone . ( He bows gravely and goes toward the door to the hall . ) HARRY ( imitating Edward 's pose ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any bloody war , Edward . You have a terrible responsibility on your shoulders . ( Edward glares at him for a moment as if meditating a retort but thinks better of it and goes out . ) BESSIE If he is n't the original Mr. Gloom ! MARY ( intent on finding out all the facts of John 's romance ) John , does Mr. Steele know about Maud 's accepting you ? p. 18 JOHN ( fidgetting ) Yes , we both told him tonight . He seems quite reconciled to our news . Of course , it is understood the engagement will have to be a long one , as I have my way to make and my future  --  HARRY Stop ! What has an engaged man to say about his own future ? Speaking of futures shall I communicate to you the reverend judge 's ( indicating his father ) sentence regarding yours ? He has sentenced you to a lifetime of delightful idleness  --  You are condemned to be a lawyer . BESSIE What ? You 're joking . MARY A lawyer ? BROWN ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have decided John shall go to law school this fall . He fully agrees with me that the practice of law opens up the land of opportunity to a young man of position . ( John 's miserable expression contradicts this sweeping statement . ) BESSIE ( impetuously turning to her father ) But John does n't want to be a lawyer . HARRY Just exactly what I said . BROWN You hear how cock-sure they are , John . You better tell them the truth . JOHN ( falteringly ) I 'm afraid what Bessie said is the truth , Father . p. 19 BROWN ( frowning ) What ! JOHN I do n't want to be a lawyer . When you spoke to me about this before you did n't really give me a chance to say what I thought . You decided it all for me . I have been intending to tell you how I felt ever since but you never mentioned it again and I thought you had discovered my unfitness and given up the idea . ( There is a pause during which all eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angry bewilderment . ) BROWN Given up the idea ? Why , I supposed the thing settled ! That 's why I never spoke of it . JOHN ( simply ) I 'm sorry , Father . It has been a misunderstanding all around . BESSIE How could you imagine John a lawyer , Daddy ! BROWN ( gently ) We 're not all gifted with your insight , my dear . ( turning to John rather severely ) Young man , this is a sad blow to all my plans for you . I 'm sure this decision of yours is a hasty one and you will reconsider it when you 've looked more thoroughly into the matter . JOHN I think not , Father . I am certain of my own mind or I would n't trouble you so . BROWN May I ask what your objections are ? p. 20 JOHN Just this , Father : I simply am not fitted for it . The idea is repugnant to me , and it 's useless for me to try and live a lie . As a lawyer I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years you , yourself , would be the first to regret it . My interest in life is different , and if I wish to be a man I must develope the inclinations which God has given me  --  not attempt to blot them out . BESSIE Hear ! Hear ! BROWN Why are you so sure you would n't learn to like the law ? You know very little about it on which to base such a pronounced dislike . JOHN ( in great nervous excitement ) Oh , I have seen and met all the lawyers in town  --  most of them at any rate  --  and I do n't care for them . I do n't understand them or they me . We 're of a different breed . How do I know I would n't learn to like law ? In the same way a man knows he can not love two women at the same time . I love , really love in the full sense of the word , something else in life . If I took up law I would betray my highest hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this outburst ) And what is this  --  er  --  love of yours ? JOHN ( his large eyes glowing with enthusiasm ) Art ! I am an artist in soul I know . My brain values are Art values . I want to learn how to express in terms of color the dreams in my brain which demand expression . ( Harry gives a comic gasp and winks at Mary who is regarding John as if he were a lunatic . In fact , it is plain there is a suspicion in the minds of all of them except Bessie that perhaps John has been drinking. ) p. 21 BROWN ( stupefied ) Do I understand you to say you wish to make painting pictures the serious aim of your life ? JOHN ( his fiery ardor smothered under this wet blanket ) I wish to become an artist , yes , if that 's what you mean . I want to go to art school instead of law school , if you will permit me to choose my own career . HARRY ( triumphantly ) I 'm a bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school will be very inexpensive . You remember Babe Carter , my room-mate at Princeton ? The fellow who came up here to spend last Thanksgiving holidays with us ? ( Brown nods . ) HARRY ( mischievously ) Ask Bessie if she remembers . ( Bessie looks confused . ) JOHN Well , he 's going to art school in New York this Fall ; has made arrangements to take a studio with two other fellows and wants me to come in with them . With four in the studio the living expenses would be reduced to almost nothing ; while on the other hand the cost of sending me to law school would be pretty heavy , as you know . BROWN ( impatiently ) But heavens , boy , what money is there in art ? From all I 've ever read about artists it seems the only time their pictures sell for a big price is after they 're dead . p. 22 JOHN There are plenty of artists in the world today who are painting and making their living at it . ( eagerly ) But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work they 're doing  --  the beauty and wonder of it ! ( He stops realizing the hopelessness of trying to make them understand this side of the question . ) BROWN It seems to me a young man who is engaged to be married ought to make money the important point . MARY ( severely ) Does Maud know of this craze of your 's ? JOHN Yes , Maud knows of this craze of mine , as you are pleased to call it , and approves of it in every way . She realizes I would not be worthy of her love if I were not true to myself . MARY ( sneeringly ) Love must be blind . And I suppose you told Mr. Steele all about your intended career ? JOHN I talked it all over with him this evening . MARY ( sarcastically ) And of course he approved ! JOHN He certainly did ! BROWN What ! HARRY Aw , what'a you giving us ! p. 23 MARY I do n't believe it . BESSIE Bully for old Steele ! I never thought he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disputing your statement , John , but it seems impossible a practical , hard-headed business man like my friend Steele could approve of this idea of yours . Are you sure he understood this was to be your whole occupation , not just a side issue ? Now I , myself , think you 'd be foolish to drop painting altogether when you 've such a talent and liking for it . But as a means of living I ca n't see it . JOHN I laid emphasis on that point in my conversation with Mr. Steele . I told him quite frankly I was painting my life work . He said it was a good idea and told me he did n't think much of your law school plan . BROWN Well ! ( The others are all equally astonished . ) JOHN He 'll be here in a few minutes and verify my statement ; he said he 'd be over tonight to have a talk with you . BROWN I 'll be very glad to hear his views on this matter . His opinions are always sound and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rising stiffly from her chair ) Well , if Mr. Steele is coming over we 'd better make ourselves a little more presentable . Come Bessie ! You , too , Mother . p. 24 MRS . BROWN ( going toward hall door with Bessie and Mary ) Goodness , Johnnie , why could n't you have told us before ? The house is in a nice state . ( They go out with Mrs. Brown fuming and fretting . ) HARRY ( beckoning to John ) A word with you . ( whispering ) Have you got a real cigarette ? ( John produces a box . ) Thanks , I 'll take a couple . The week is waning and in the latter end of weeks I 'm usually confined to a diet of self-mades. ( puts cigarette in mouth ) Stringency of the paternal money market , you know . ( lights cigarette ) And now I 'll say farewell . I want to get away before old Steele comes . He detests me , and with all due respect to your future father-in-law I think he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruffle his good nature to find me here . ( then seriously ) John , I did n't get some of that high-brow stuff you pulled . It sort of soared over my sordid bean  --  some phrase , that , what ?  - -  but volplaning down from your lofty artistic ozone I want to say I 'm for you . Do what you want to do , that 's the only dope . I ca n't wish you any better than good luck . ( He holds out his hand which John clasps heartily , his face lighting up with gratitude . The door bell rings . ) There he is now . I 'll blow out the back way ; be good ; s'long , Father . ( He goes out by the door to left leading to the dining room , carefully closing it after him. ) p. 25 BROWN You better go out and meet him , John . ( John hurries into the hall and returns a moment later with Steele . Steele is a tall , stout , vigorous looking man of about fifty-five , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ importance in the town and takes this importance seriously . He has grey hair and a short-cropped grey mustache ; a full florid face with undistinguished features , and small , shrewd , grey eyes . He is carefully dressed in a well-fitting light suit and looks the part of the prosperous small-town merchant . He comes over to Brown , who has risen to greet him , and they shake hands after the manner of old friends . ) STEELE Good evening , Ed . BROWN Glad to see you , Dick . Sit down and make yourself at home . ( They both take chairs by the table . A confused babble of women 's voices and laughter is heard from the hallway . ) Maud come over with you ? STEELE Yes . ( with a wink at Brown ) And that being the case I guess we can excuse the young man here , do n't you think so , Ed ? BROWN ( laughingly ) Oh , I guess we can manage . ( John gives an embarrassed laugh and hurries out . ) STEELE Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( feelingly ) She 's all I 've got , you know ; but if it has to be someone I 'm mighty glad it 's one of your boys . For a time I sort of thought it would be Edward . He spoke to me once about the matter and I wished him luck . I like Edward very much . He 's a good solid business man and bound to succeed ; but Maud did n't love him and there you are . I guess she and John were pretty thick even then , although I never suspected what was in the wind until just lately . p. 26 BROWN I ca n't say I was wholly unprepared for John 's announcement . He has n't much of a faculty for hiding his feelings  --  too nervous and high-strung . ( with a chuckle ) Of course his mother has known right along . You ca n't fool a woman on those things . STEELE ( sadly ) I wish Maud 's mother were alive today . ( briskly ) Well , well , what ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likable chap , and Maud says she loves him , so I 'm sure I 'm satisfied . As long as she 's happy I 'm contented . She 's the boss . BROWN John 's got his way to make yet , but as long as they 're willing to make it a long engagement  --  STEELE ( interrupting him laughingly ) I 'm selfish enough to like the idea of the marriage being a long ways off ; I 'll have Maud so much longer . BROWN Speaking of John 's future , he told me tonight you fully approved of this artistic notion of his  --  going to art school and all that . I found it pretty hard to believe , knowing you the way I do . STEELE John was perfectly right . I think it 's the real thing for him .

Nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it or is going to have one . Where will they all get cases ? Why , do you know , I actually think some families get into suits just to give their sons a job . BROWN I 'll have to admit there 's an abundance of legal talent in Bridgetown ; but in a broader field  --  STEELE Same thing all over the country  --  too many lawyers and doctors . Besides , John would never make a lawyer  --  too sensitive and retiring . You have to have push and gall to burn . On the other hand he 's got an undoubted talent for painting . I 've seen sketches he made for Maud and those drawings he did for the college magazine . They 're great ! And look at those posters he did for the Fair last month  --  finest things of the kind I ever looked at . John 's bound to succeed . I 'm sure of it . BROWN ( dubiously ) But where does the money end of it come in ? STEELE Money ? Why , Ed , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I know of a young fellow in New York who paints those high-toned fashion plates . He makes between ten and twelve thousand dollars a year ; has his own business and everything . He 's only been at it a few years , too . ( Brown is evidently impressed but shakes his head doubtfully . ) Look at the magazines . ( He picks one from the table and points to the picture on the outside cover  --  a girl 's head . ) How much do you think that fellow got for that ? Not less than a couple of hundred dollars , I 'll bet . John could draw a prettier girl than that in half an hour . With new magazines coming out every month the demand for that sort of stuff is tremendous . There 's all kinds of opportunity for a young fellow with the goods ; and John has the goods . I tell you , Ed , you do n't appreciate the talent your own son has . p. 28 BROWN But he wants to go to art school . STEELE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he thinks he 's got any rough edges that need polishing off , why let him have a year or so of schooling . He looks as good to me right now as any of them , but he 's a better judge than we are on that point . He ca n't be too good and while he 's studying he can be looking around New York getting the lay of the land . He 'll meet a lot of people in the same line who can put him on to the ropes . BROWN But listen here ! I never heard him mention the advertising or magazine end of it . His ideas on the subject of painting are very lofty . He may consider such things beneath him . You 've never seen any of his big oil paintings , have you ? STEELE No BROWN You 'd hardly call those a salable product . ( with a smile ) It 's hard to make out what some of them are STEELE ( laughingly ) They must be some of those Impressionistic pictures you hear so much about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that . Give him a year in New York and do n't allow him any more money than is absolutely necessary , and I 'll guarantee at the end of that time he 'll have lost his high-fangled notions . He 's just an enthusiastic kid and there 's nothing like a year in New York to make him realize the importance of a bank account and settle down to brass tacks . He 'll get in with the others who are making money and want to fall in line . But do n't let on about this to him . There 's no use in offending the young man 's dignity . Encourage him to go to the city and paint his head off . He 'll come gradually to see the commercial aspects of the case  --  especially if you keep a tight hand on the pocket-book. p. 29 BROWN ( his face clearing ) You 've convinced me , Dick . I 'll let the boy go his own road . STEELE ( complacently ) That 's the idea . Biggest mistake in the world to force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BROWN ( in a stage whisper ) And now what do you say to a wee drop to celebrate this joyful occasion ? STEELE ( in the same tone ) Your proposition tickles me to death . BROWN Then follow me . ( They go into the dining room , shutting the door after them . A moment later John appears in the doorway leading to the hall . He looks quickly around to make sure the room is empty ; then beckons to someone in the hall behind him , and walks softly over to the table . Maud Steele , giggling and flushed with excitement , tiptoes after him . She is a remarkably pretty girl of twenty with great blue eyes , golden brown hair , and small delicate features . Of medium height her figure is lithe and graceful . She is dressed in a fluffy white summer frock and wears white tennis shoes . Her rather kittenish manner and the continual pout of her small red mouth indicate the spoiled child even before one hears the note of petulance in her soft , all-too-sweet voice. ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She comes over to John who takes her in his arms and kisses her passionately . ) JOHN Oh , Maudie dear , I ca n't realize it . It all seems too good to be true . MAUD Do n't . ( He releases her . She speaks with soft reproach . ) You 've got my dress all mussed up . What will your sisters think . ( makes a face at him ) Rough thing . JOHN ( making a motion as if to take her in his arms again ) Dear ! MAUD ( moving out of reach  --  mockingly ) I said just one . Are n't you ever satisfied ? JOHN With kissing you ? Each one is sweeter than the last and I eternally long for the next one . MAUD Thank you . You do say such sweet things , Johnnie dear . We 'll be caught if we stay in here much longer . Where are the two fathers ? JOHN In the dining room , I guess . We can hear them coming . MAUD Is it all settled  --  about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dearest girl . ( She evades him . ) Yes , cruel one , it 's all settled . All I 'm afraid of is father wo n't let me go to art school . He ca n't understand . None of them can but you and Bessie. p. 31 MAUD ( stamping her foot ) He must ; I wo n't have you a horrid old lawyer . ( with a confident smile ) Papa 'll persuade him . I 'm sure of it . He thinks you 'll just make oodles and oodles of money in New York when you get started . JOHN ( frowning ) The money part will take a long time , I 'm afraid . ( turning to her with deep emotion ) But you 'll wait for me , wo n't you , dear ? You 'll have faith in me , wo n't you ?  --  no matter what they say ? It 's going to be a long hard struggle . MAUD Of course I will , silly boy ! ( She goes to the table . The magazine with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it up with a flourish . ) Look ! Papa says he gets a couple of hundred dollars apiece for those . ( She smiles at him rougishly . ) I know whose name is going to be down in the corner there in a year or so . ( John makes a gesture of annoyance . ) Oh , I 'll be so proud then ! I 'll carry a copy with me all the time and show it to everyone I meet . JOHN ( contemplating the picture on the cover with a contemptuous smile reads the title disdainfully ) The September Girl , eh ? MAUD Is n't she just too sweet for anything ? p. 32 JOHN Too sweet for anything human . ( In sudden impatience he takes the magazine from her hand and drops it into the waste-paper basket . Maud looks at him in pained astonishment , her large eyes filling with tears at his rudeness . John takes her in his arms in a passion of repentance . ) Forgive me , Maudie ! I only meant I want to do much finer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( winking her tears away and smiling up into his face ) Of course I do ! ( He kisses her again as The Curtain Falls ) @x SCENE  --  A studio in New York on a cold evening in March , a year and a half later . On the left a black table with a reading lamp and a confused mass of books and pamphlets on it . Farther back a large bay-window looking out over the street , with a comfortable window-seat piled up with faded cushions . In the corner a number of frames for paintings stacked up against the wall . Before them a divan with a dark red cover . The far side of the room is hidden by a profusion of paintings of all sizes and subjects . There are nudes and landscapes , portraits and seascapes ; also a number of small prints of old masters filling up the smaller wall spaces . Two long , low book cases , with a piano between them take up all the lower space . On the right of the studio a kitchinette hidden by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the foreground a doorway leading in to the kitchinette . Over the doorway a curtain of green material . In the front of the partition and helping to conceal it , another book case . In the far , right-hand corner where the partition ends is a small hallway leading to the outer door . Two rather disabled-looking Morris-chairs are on either side of the table . Several rocking chairs are placed nearby . The rest of the floor space is occupied by a model stand of dark wood and a huge easel on which a half-finished painting is clamped . There is a large skylight in the middle of the ceiling which sheds the glow from the lights of the city down in a sort of faint half-light . The reading lamp on the table , connected by a tube with a gas-jet on the wall above , and another gas-jet near the piano furnish the only light . John , Babe Carter , and Steve Harrington are discovered fussing around the studio trying to get things in order . Carter is a broad-shouldered giant with a mop of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He has large deep-set , blue eyes and fine , handsome features . His voice is a deep bass and his laugh a marvel of heartiness . His coat is off and he appears in a white soft shirt and khaki trousers . Harrington is a tall slender fellow of about twenty-eight , with large , irregular features , light brown hair , and brown eyes set far apart . He is dressed in a black suit and wears a white shirt with a soft collar and a bow tie . His manner is reserved and quiet , but when he does speak his voice is low and pleasing . John has on a heavy , grey overcoat and a green felt hat . He has aged considerably , and there are lines of worry about his eyes . His face has an unhealthy city pallor , and he seems very nervous . JOHN ( going toward door ) Time for me to be going . I 've got to meet him at 7.30 at the hotel . I 'll bring him right over . p. 34 CARTER And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be just as well for you if your father does n't meet me ; and I 'll have a better chance of seeing Bessie now that he 's out of town . JOHN Well , you know you 've got my best wishes . I hope you win . CARTER Thanks . ( laughing ) I wish more of your family could say the same . JOHN Give my love to Maudie if you see her . ( He stops at the door . ) Remember I wo n't be long , not more than half an hour at most , and if you want to get away without meeting father , you better hurry . CARTER Do n't worry . I wo n't be here  --  not on your life ! ( John goes out . ) CARTER ( picking up a pair of old pants off the nearest divan ) What 'll I do with these ? HARRINGTON ( carelessly ) Must be Ted 's  --  in under the couch with them ! We 'll teach him the first principles of neatness . CARTER Old man Brown would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mode of life . In under the couch with them you say ? All right  --  only they happen to be yours . HARRINGTON ( hastily ) Hold ! ( goes over to Babe and gets them ) p. 35 CARTER First principles of neatness , you know . HARRINGTON ( throws the pants over the partition into the kitchinette ) I would n't have these pants treated with indignity for worlds . Have you no respect for old age ? ( He looks Babe up and down with a critical stare . ) Babe , I wonder at you ! Are you going a'courting in those ? ( indicates Babes trousers ) They 'll lock you in the Bridgetown jail and throw away the key . CARTER ( resignedly ) I suppose I 'd better change . ( He goes into the kitchinette and can be heard pulling out the drawers of a dresser . ) I 'll sacrifice my pants to small-town respectability , but I wish to state right here that my soft shirt stays on . My collars have gotten so small for me I nearly commit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( He appears in the doorway with one of the offending collars clutched around his neck . His flesh bulges out over it . Steve laughs , and sits down in one of the chairs near the table . ) HARRINGTON This visit of old Browns promises to be stormy , if his letters to John are any indication . CARTER ( from inside the partition ) I 'm sure glad my folks are located so far out in the wild and wooly they ca n't come to visit . Although I do n't think they 'd be shocked any  --  more liable to be disappointed . From my kid brother 's letters I gather he believes we maintain a large harem full of beautiful models with names like Suzette and Mimi . You can judge for yourself how the study of art has begun to fascinate him . He 's been reading some Iowa school teachers romance of Paris Latin Quarter life , I guess . I 've tried to disillusion him  --  told him the only naughty models nowadays were cloak and suit models  --  but whats the use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't try to hog all the artistic temperament of the family . ( Steve laughs . ) But I reckon Pop 'll keep him out on the ranch . The kid 's talents run more to branding cattle than to painting them , and Pop considers one artist in the family enough . ( He comes out of the kitchinette and sits down near Steve . ) They all think I 'm going to be the greatest artist in the world , and they 're willing to stake me to all they 've got . If I did n't have confidence of getting somewhere , I 'd have quit long ago . But how do I look ? ( He gets up and turns slowly around for inspection . He has changed to creaseless , baggy , dark pants and a wrinkled coat matching them. ) p. 36 HARRINGTON ( solemnly eyeing him ) O feebleness of words ! CARTER Remember the true artist sees beauty even in the commonest things . ( a pause ) Appreciation is n't one of your long points , I see . ( He sits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just about to say you resembled an enlarged edition of Beau Brummel . CARTER Enlarged ? You 're sure you did n't mean distorted ? HARRINGTON God forbid ! Candidly , you look surprisingly respectable . CARTER Disgustingly respectable , as Ted would say . By the way , where 's Ted ? HARRINGTON ( surprised ) Do n't you know ? Then let me tell you the astounding news . You know how despairfully he has wailed about his having to seek a reporting job if something did n't turn up soon . Well , he got a check today  --  sold one of his stories . CARTER What ! HARRINGTON Yea , verily ; incredible to relate , it is true . You remember that blood-soaked detective yarn of his  --  the one where the lady 's husband strangles her with a piece of barbwire and hides her head in the piano . ( Babe groans . ) That 's the one . The New Magazine bought it and sent Ted a check for fifty large dollars . p. 37 CARTER O festive occasion ! I suppose he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better prepare the net and straight jacket . HARRINGTON He wo n't be in till God knows when  --  maybe not at all . ( A knock at the door is heard . ) CARTER They could n't have got over that quick . ( He hides in the kitchinette nevertheless . ) HARRINGTON Come in ! ( Eugene Grammont , Master of the Art School , comes slowly into the room . He is a slight , stoop-shouldered , old man of sixty or more with a mass of wavy white hair and a white mustache and imperial . His keen , black eyes peer kindly out of his lean ascetic face . He is dressed entirely in black with a white shirt and collar and a black Windsor tie . There is a distinct foreign atmosphere about him , but he speaks English without a trace of an accent . ) GRAMMONT ( ceremoniously , with a little bow ) Good evening , gentlemen . HARRINGTON Good evening . CARTER ( coming out again ) Wo n't you sit down ? GRAMMONT ( taking a chair near them ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it be rude of me to remark upon the unusual neatness of the studio ? p. 38 CARTER And of the occupants of the studio ? GRAMMONT I did not say that , but since you mention it  --  CARTER We 're expecting visitors , or , I should say , a visitor , the father of your worthy pupil , John . GRAMMONT Indeed . ( with a troubled expression ) What type of a man is his father ? HARRINGTON I 've never met him but Babe knows him quite well . CARTER I spent several vacations at their home when we were in college together ; you know I live so far out West I never could make the trip . Old man Brown is a common enough type , but I 'm afraid he 's not the kind of man you have much sympathy for . He 's a hardware merchant with a large family , moderately rich , self-made , hard-headed , and with absolutely not the faintest appreciation of Art in any form . GRAMMONT I thought it would be so . HARRINGTON I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were impossible . He wanted him to study law , you know . He 's sorry now he did n't compel him to do so ; says he 's wasting time and money down here . As for the family I believe the height of their ambition was to see John making fashion-plates and pretty girls at so much per page , and they 're all disappointed because he does n't move in that direction . p. 39 CARTER ( quickly ) All but Bess ; she encourages him to go ahead . GRAMMONT Ah , it is well he has someone , poor boy . Who is she ,  --  his fiancee ? HARRINGTON ( with a smile ) No , his sister ; but suspected of being another artists fiancee . ( He looks pointedly at Babe whose face reddens . ) GRAMMONT ( leaning over and patting Babe 's knee with his long white hand ) I am indeed glad to hear it . CARTER I have hopes  --  that 's all . GRAMMONT You have more than hopes or you would not  --  hope . But have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married ? CARTER Yes ; he is . GRAMMONT And the girl ? HARRINGTON You 've met her . Do n't you remember one Sunday last winter we had sort of a tea here , and John introduced you to a girl ,  --  a very pretty girl with golden-brown hair ? The tea was in her honor . You only glanced in for a moment . GRAMMONT A moment  --  I detest teas and never go to one ; that is why I remember your 's so distinctly ; you all looked so out of place . Surely you can not mean the girl who was so shocked at all your nudes  --  and said so ? p. 40 HARRINGTON ( dryly ) You have guessed it . GRAMMONT ( with a comic groan ) That doll-face ! How could she understand ? Oh , how blind is love ! HARRINGTON She is evidently very much in love with John . She , at least , tries to understand , and if she ca n't it 's hardly her fault , with all her environment and bringing-up to fight against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand . GRAMMONT Mon Dieu , but our friend John seems to have a hard fight before him . It is too bad . Never in my long experience as teacher have I met a young man who gave finer promise of becoming a great artist  --  and I have taught many who are on the heights today . He has the soul , he has everything . ( passionately ) And behold these worshipers of the golden calf , these muddy souls , will exert all their power to hold him to their own level . ( shakes his head sadly ) And I am afraid they may succeed if , as you say , he loves one of them . He is not one of the strong ones who can fight against discouragement and lack of appreciation through long years of struggle . He is all-too-sensitive and finely-keyed . I have noticed of late how his work has fallen off . It is as if the life and vigour had departed from it . His mind has not been able to joyfully concentrate on the Art he loves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no doubt . She urged him to return home and do his painting there . GRAMMONT She does not know how much he has yet to learn . CARTER His people would soon nag all the art out of him up there . But I do n't agree with you about John being as weak as you think . He 's got the grit . If his old man does stop the money he can get some work here in town ,  --  something to keep him alive , at any rate , while he goes on with his painting . HARRINGTON What can he do in a money making way ? CARTER ( after a pause ) I ca n't think of anything . He 's always been so unpractical ,  --  even more so than most of us . HARRINGTON There you are ! That means the best he can hope for is drudgery . He 'll be able to keep alive ; but he wo n't paint . I tried it before my father died , and I know ; and I 'm a good deal less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other abominations . In my younger days those things were forced on me ; I had to learn something about them . GRAMMONT You are right . In John 's case the thing would be a tragedy ; and he is so worthy of surviving ! CARTER Ca n't we think of something to do to help him ? Of course , in a money way it 's impossible , and even if it were n't he 'd never accept , but  --  p. 42 HARRINGTON Let 's see . It would n't be the slightest use for me to say anything to the old man ; but you ( turning to Grammont ) might be able to convince him of John 's future and persuade him to keep his hands off for a while . GRAMMONT I will be more than glad to try if you think it might benefit John in any way ; but I fear you overestimate my ability as mediator . I do not know how to talk to that class of people . HARRINGTON It will do no harm to try . GRAMMONT ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's the stuff ! We 'll pull him out of the hole yet . GRAMMONT When do you expect them ? CARTER They ought to be here in five or ten minutes now . GRAMMONT Then I will leave you . ( He goes toward door . ) You will let me know when the propitious time comes ? HARRINGTON I 'm coming to your studio as soon as they arrive ; want to give them a chance to argue it all out themselves . After a time we 'll come back and I 'll take John away and leave you alone with the terrible parent . GRAMMONT I see . ( He goes out. ) p. 43 HARRINGTON The poor Old Master ! He 's as much worried as if John were his own son . CARTER It would be a God 's blessing for John if the Old Master were his father instead of the present incumbent . Why is it fine things like that never happen ? ( He goes into the kitchinette and returns wearing a dark overcoat and derby hat and carrying a suit case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is n't that the hell of a name for an artist ? Look better at the top of a grocery store than on the bottom of a painting . The only thing recorded in the Book of Fame about a John Brown is that his body lies moldering in the grave ,  --  nice thought , that ! HARRINGTON ( laughing ) You ca n't complain of lacking a famous Carter . Everyones heard of Nick . CARTER Yes , all through college I just escaped that nickname . HARRINGTON What 's that ! ( picking up a book as if to hurl it at Babe 's head ) Was that pun intentional ? CARTER What pun ? ( He realizes and bursts into a roar of laughter . ) No , on the level , I never thought of it . I humbly beg your pardon . All the same , that 's some pun and I wo n't forget it . HARRINGTON I 'll bet you wo n't ; and you 'll not let anyone else forget it either . p. 44 CARTER It was a toss-up whether Nick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so big , fat , ugly , and awkward when at prep . school , they just could n't resist the temptation of " Babe " . So Babe I 've been ever since . ( a pause during which he chuckles to himself and Steve grins at him ) Well , I 'm off . ( He goes toward door . ) Nick-name , eh ? Oh , I guess that 's rotten . ( He shakes with laughter . ) HARRINGTON Shut up ! Oh , but you 're the subtle humorist . Look out you do n't run into them . CARTER Trust me to hide if I see old Brown . So long ! HARRINGTON Good luck ! ( Babe goes out . Steve sits for a while reading . Presently a rap on the door is heard . Steve gets up and walks toward it as Brown and John enter . Brown seems a little leaner and his lips are stern and unsmiling . He wears a black derby hat and heavy black overcoat . ) JOHN You have n't met Mr. Harrington , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know . ( Steve and Brown shake hands and murmur conventional nothings . ) HARRINGTON You 'll excuse me , I hope ? I was just going over to Grammonts studio when you came in . I 'll be back later . p. 45 BROWN ( perfunctorily ) Hope I 'm not driving you away . HARRINGTON Oh , not at all . ( He goes out . John takes off coat and hat , helps father off with his things and puts them on the window-seat . He and father take chairs near the table . ) BROWN I 'm glad that other fellow is n't here . JOHN You mean Carter ? BROWN Yes ,  --  the good-for-nothing ! JOHN ( quietly ) Babe is my best friend . BROWN When you hear what I have to tell you about that same Carter , I think you 'll agree with me , the less you have to do with him in future the better . JOHN Babe has done nothing dishonorable , I know . BROWN It all depends on what you artists understand by honor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? He 's been coming to Bridgetown and meeting Bessie on the sly . I found out about it and spoke to her last evening . She as much as told me to mind my own business , and said she intended to marry this Carter . I lost my temper and informed her that if she married that loafer I 'd have nothing more to do with her . What do think she did ? Packed up her things and left the house ,  --  yes , in spite of all your mother could say  --  and went to the hotel and got a room . p. 46 JOHN ( impulsively ) Good for Bess ! BROWN Am I to infer from that remark that you approve of her conduct ? JOHN Of course , I approve of it . I 've known about it all along . Babe told me every time he went up and I wished him luck . If they met secretly , it 's all your own fault . You told Bessie you did n't want him in the house . She loves him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's have none of that romantic piffle . I 've heard enough of it from Bessie . JOHN She must be true to herself . Her duty to herself stands before her duty to you . BROWN ( losing all control and pounding on the arm of his chair with his fist ) Rot ! Damned rot ! only believed by a lot of crazy Socialists and Anarchists . What is a father for I 'd like to know ? JOHN ( shrugging his shoulders ) I suppose , when a man is a willing party to bringing children into the world , he takes upon himself the responsibility of doing all in his power to further their happiness . BROWN But is n't that what I 'm doing ? JOHN Absolutely not ! You consider your children to be your possessions , your property , to belong to you . You do n't think of them as individuals with ideas and desires of their own . It 's for you to find out the highest hope of each of them and give it your help and sympathy . Are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're trying to substitute a desire of your own which you think would benefit her in a worldly way . p. 47 BROWN Stuff ! Bessie has no experience with the world . Would you like me to stand by and see her ruin her life , and not do my best to protect her ? JOHN Why will you harp on her ruining her life ? If she marries Babe , they are both to be congratulated . Bess is a great girl and Babe is as fine and clean a fellow as ever lived . You are angry because you planned to marry her to someone else . Why not be frank about it ? BROWN ( indignantly ) I do n't want her to be tied to a penniless adventurer . It 's true Mr. Arnold asked her to marry him , and that I fully approved . I still hope she 'll marry him . He 's an established man with plenty of money and position and  --  JOHN ( jumping to his feet ) And forty years old ,  --  a fool with a rotten past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all talk . He was a bit wild , that 's all ; and that was years ago . JOHN She 'll never marry him . BROWN Well , if she marries that scamp Carter , she 's left my home for good . JOHN If you treat her this way she 'll not have many regrets ; but let 's drop the subject . You did n't come down to consult me about Bess , did you ? p. 48 BROWN I should say not . I knew only too well whose side you would take . I came down to tell you we 've all decided it 's high time you gave up this art foolishness , and came home and settled down to work . I spoke with Mr. Steele about you , and he said there 's a good position open for you in his store . He 's an old man with no children except Maud , and you 'd naturally be at the head of the business after his death . He 's willing to give Maud a nice home as a wedding present , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Brown 's manner becomes more and more kindly and persuasive . ) Come , is that no inducement ? And I 'll do the best I can for you on your wedding day . You ought to consider Maud a little . She 's up there waiting for you while you idle away your time on a hobby . JOHN Hobby ! Good God , ca n't you understand me better than that ? ( frenziedly ) I 'm painting , painting , painting , ca n't you see ? BROWN Then it 's about time you showed some promise of making some money at it if you intend to marry and have children . Look at the future , boy ! You ca n't go on this way forever . Steele and I thought you 'd be selling your things long before this or I 'd never have let you come . You 're wasting time at something you 're not fitted for , it seems to me . You 've been here a year and a half , and you 're right where you started . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and looks down at the street . Brown gets up , puts on his glasses , and goes to the far wall to look at the paintings . He speaks in tones of wondering disgust . ) Who painted this ? ( pointing to an impressionistic painting of a nude dancer ) p. 49 JOHN ( wearily ) I did . BROWN You ought to be ashamed to acknowledge it . What decent family would ever hang that up in their house ? No wonder you ca n't sell anything if your fancies run that way . I 'm glad to see you did n't finish it . JOHN It is finished . BROWN You 'd never know it . She 's an awful rough looking female . That 's Impressionism , I suppose . Rot ! Damned rot ! I suppose she came here and posed  --  like that ? JOHN Yes . BROWN ( with a chuckle ) I begin to see there may be other attractions in this career of your 's besides a lofty ideal . JOHN ( furious at the insinuation in his father 's voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be so indignant . You would n't be my son if you were an angel . ( comes back to chair again ) But there 's a time for all that and I think you ought to settle down ,  --  for Maud 's sake anyway . This atmosphere is n't doing you any good , and you need the clean , Bridgetown air to set you right again , mentally and physically . You 've changed a lot since you left , and I 'm only telling the truth when I say it has n't been for the good . This big city game is a tough proposition ,  --  too tough for you when you 've got such advantages at home . ( John stares despondently at the floor . ) I saw Maud just before I left . She said to me : " Do n't tell John I said so but do try to bring him home . " p. 50 JOHN ( miserably ) Do n't You ca n't understand . ( A sound of singing from the hall .

( He offers his hand which Brown barely touches . ) BROWN ( severely ) How do you do , sir . NELSON Oh , I stagger along , I stagger along , ( with a foolish laugh ) " stagger " being the correct word at present writing . ( His eyes suddenly fix themselves on John . ) Why , hello , Old Masterpiece . ( He detaches himself from Brown and lurches over to John . ) Have you heard the glad tidings ? ( John throws a worried look at his father , who has turned his back on them . Helene , having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over toward John , whom she does n't at first recognize in the gloom of the window-seat . ) JOHN You mean about your selling that story ? Of course , I 've heard about it . Congratulations ! HELENE ( recognizing his voice , rushes over and throws her arms around his neck ) You 're a fine piece of cheese ! Do n't you remember your old friends any more ? Oh , look at him blush ! ( Brown has turned around and is frowning sternly at them . John twists out of her embrace and walks away , biting his lips with vexation. ) p. 52 NELSON ( leaning over and speaking to her in what he means to be a whisper ) Sssshhh ! Can that stuff ! That 's his old man . HELENE Oho ! NELSON ( going over to John and winking at him with drunken cunning ) S'all right . I 'll square it for you . ( He walks to Brown , not heeding John 's gestures of remonstrance . ) Mr. Brown , I have an apology to make . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have looked upon the wine , and all that . ( with a sweeping gesture which threatens to overbalance him ) Let this be my justification . I have sold for fifty shining pesos a story which I had the misfortune to write . ( Brown gives an exclamation of angry impatience . ) You are right . The idea is incredible . Let me say this in my defence , however : It was the first story I ever sold ; and it was the rottenest , absurdest , and most totally imbecile story I ever wrote ,  --  And I am a man of many manuscripts . I pity the editor who accepted it . I have pitied him all evening ,  --  toasted him for his generous humanity , and pitied him for his bad taste . ( He stops and stares vaguely at Brown who turns from him in disgust . John signals frantically and points to Helene . She stifles a giggle . Ted has a bright idea . ) Helene , you have not met John 's father . ( Helene gazes at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Mr. Brown , allow me to presence my wife . p. 53 JOHN ( tearing his hair ) Good heavens ! HELENE ( bowing with a loud giggle ) What ! Oh ,  --  pleased to meet you . BROWN ( indignant at the suspicion that he is being hoaxed ) Your wife ? ( Before anyone can say anything more the door opens and Steve comes in followed by Grammont . ) JOHN ( turns to them with a look of anguished pleading and whispers hoarsely to Steve ) Take them away for God 's sake ! ( Steve takes in the situation at a glance . He grabs Ted by the arm , and with his other hand guides Helene , weak with laughter , to the door . John brings Grammont over to introduce to his father . ) HELENE Oh , Steve , I almost died . HARRINGTON Come on over to Grammonts and dance . ( as they go out ) NELSON Dance ? That 's my middle name .

I 'm glad to meet you , sir . p. 54 GRAMMONT ( taking his hand ) The pleasure is mine . ( They sit down together by the table . ) HARRINGTON ( from the door ) Oh ; John ! I need your moral support . Come over to Grammonts for a moment , will you ? JOHN All right . Excuse me for a moment , will you , Father . ( He goes out . ) GRAMMONT ( after an embarrassed pause ) It gives me great pleasure to be able to tell you that your son , John , is one of the most promising pupils who has ever entered my school . He has all the qualities of a great artist . BROWN ( not impressed ,  --  thinking this praise but the business policy of the head of a school with the father of a well-paying pupil ) I have no doubt of it but  --  GRAMMONT ( earnestly ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his continuing his artistic career ; that you think it better for him to take up something else ? ( Brown nods . ) My dear sir , you will pardon me if I presume on such short acquaintance to say that I think you are making a great mistake . ( Brown frowns . ) In the interest of the Art I love , I implore you not to withdraw your support from John at this crucial moment in his life when he has most need of you and your encouragement . He is just finding himself , becoming conscious of his own powers . Discouragement now would be fatal to his future ; and I can unhesitatingly predict a great future for him ,  --  for I know a real artist when I see one . p. 55 BROWN I 'm much obliged to you for your frankness , but there are a great many things which influence my decision which you ca n't possibly know of . GRAMMONT ( with grave conviction ) I know your decision will spoil his life . BROWN ( rising to his feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter of opinion . Our points of view are different . It seems to me his life is more likely to be ruined idlying his time away down here with drunken companions , and low women of the type I have just met . GRAMMONT But what you have seen is the unfortunate exception  --  BROWN ( pointing to the paintings ) And are all those naked women who come here to pose , are they exceptions ? Is this the atmosphere for a young man to live in who 's engaged to a decent girl ? GRAMMONT ( also rising to his feet  --  to himself , half-aloud , with a shrug of hopelessness ) Alas , the poor boy is lost . BROWN ( overhearing him  --  sarcastically ) Of course , I appreciate the fact that it 's your business to keep your pupils as long as possible . ( John enters as his father is speaking. ) p. 56 GRAMMONT ( flushing with anger ) You are insulting , sir ! I was only trying to save your son . ( He walks quickly to John and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John , remember ! For that no sacrifice is too great . ( He goes out . ) JOHN What 's the matter ? BROWN ( picking up his hat and coat ) Matter enough ; that old fool was trying to get me to keep paying out money to him for all this nonsense of your 's . JOHN That 's not true ! He 's above such considerations . BROWN ( putting on overcoat ) Rot ! I saw through him and I let him know it . He 'll mind his own business after this . JOHN He 's one of the finest men I have ever known . BROWN No doubt , no doubt ! They are all fine people you live with down here ,  --  drunkards , old lunatics , and women of the streets . ( as John starts to expostulate ) Oh , I 've seen one of your models ; that 's enough . JOHN ( with a hysterical laugh ) But she 's only a cloak and suit model  --  now ! BROWN It makes no difference . I tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough of it . You either come home with me in the morning or you need n't look to me for help in the future . I 'll bring you to your senses . Starve awhile , and see how much bread and butter this high art will bring you ! No more coming to me for money , do you understand ? p. 57 JOHN ( dully ) Yes . BROWN ( after a pause ) Well , if you decide to come with me , meet me at that ten-four train . Think it over . JOHN I have thought it over . I wo n't come . BROWN ( starting toward door ) You 'll change your tune when you see how much help you 'll get from these so-called friends of yours . Think it over . I 've got to save you in spite of yourself , if there 's no other way . ( He stops at the door . ) And remember Steele wo n't keep that position open for you forever . JOHN ( pouring out all his rage ) Oh , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a slam as SCENE  --  The studio about three o'clock on a hot Sunday afternoon in July of the same year . John , Steve , and Ted are discovered . Steve , dressed in his dark suit , is sprawled out in one of the Morris chairs near the table . John is painting at an unfinished portrait clamped on the big easel in under the skylight . His hands are paint-stained and a daub of brown shows on one of his cheeks . He is dressed in a dirty paint-smirched pair of grey flannel trousers , a grey flannel shirt open at the neck , and a pair of " sneaks " . His face is haggard and dissipated-looking . Ted is sitting on the window-seat idly watching the street below . He wears a shabby light suit and a pair of tan shoes run down at the heel . A straw hat is perched on the back of his head . JOHN ( throwing down his brush with an exclamation of hopeless irritation ) It 's no use ; I might as well quit . Nothing seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sits by Ted . ) HARRINGTON No use trying to work with that feeling . I know ; I 've had experience with it myself . JOHN The sad part of it is , mine seems to be chronic . HARRINGTON You 'll get over it . You 're worrying too much about other things . When they go the emptiness 'll go with them . ( John does not answer but stares moodily at the street below. ) p. 59 NELSON ( after a pause  --  with a groan of boredom ) What a hellish long day Sunday is ! On the level , I 'd be better satisfied if I had to work . Nothing to do all day and no place to go that 's fit to go to . HARRINGTON Better advise your editor to get out a Sunday afternoon paper . Tell him you 're anxious to work more for the same pay ; that ought to fetch him . NELSON You do n't call that emaciated envelope I drag down every week " pay " do you ? I 'm getting less now than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenderness I was n't fired when they cut down for the summer . Every time my high literary ambitions fall to earth for lack of appreciative editors , and I have to hunt a job again , I find out I 'm worth less money . They 'll have me selling the papers some day , at this rate . HARRINGTON How about short-story writing on the Sabbath ? Have you any religious convictions which bar you from that ? NELSON I 've already written more short stories than Maupassant and O. Henry put together  --  and I sold one . I 'll have to wait until some philanthropist endows a college for the higher education of editors before I stand a chance . HARRINGTON You mentioned an idea for a play . Play writing is a good , healthy Sabbath exercise . p. 60 NELSON Oh , my ideas are plentiful enough ; but execution does n't seem to be my long suit . I 'm always going to start that play  --  tomorrow . ( gloomily ) They ought to write on my tombstone : The deceased at last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It would be rather an appropriate epitaph . HARRINGTON ( with a grin ) What time did you get in last night ? NELSON This morning . HARRINGTON I thought this was a little morning-after pessimism . I do n't want to preach but is n't that the answer , Ted ? And you too , John ? ( John shruggs his shoulders indifferently . ) NELSON I suppose so ; but the helluvit is I never see that side of the argument till afterwards . You ca n't keep a squirrel on the ground ; not unless you cut down all the trees . JOHN ( to Ted ) Where did we end up last night ? NELSON ( shaking his head sorrowfully ) Ask me not . All I know is I feel like a wet rag today . HARRINGTON ( smilingly quotes ) Have drowned my glory in a shallow cup . NELSON Oh , stop that noise , Mr. Ree Morse ! p. 61 JOHN ( impatiently to Steve ) It 's all right for you to talk . Everything is running smoothly with you ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and see if you wo n't want to cut loose and forget it all for a while on Saturday night . Checking sugar bags and barrels down on the docks ! Oh , it 's a nice job , mine is ! You 'd have to do it yourself for a while to know how bad it is  --  day after day of monotonous drudgery  --  life nothing but a panorama of sugar bags ! ( with a sudden burst of feeling ) Oh , how I loathe that rotten dock with its noise and smells and its  --  sugar bags . I ca n't paint any more  --  not even pretty pictures . I 've wanted to do some real work on Sundays but  --  I do n't know how to express it  --  something is like a dead weight inside me  --  no more incentive , no more imagination , no more joy in creating ,  --  only a great sickness and lassitude of soul , a desire to drink , to do anything to get out of myself and forget . HARRINGTON The trouble with you is you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't take it so seriously . It 'll all be over and forgotten before you know it . Those family brawls are part of a lifetime and we all have them and get over them without serious results . JOHN It 's not my family 's antagonism ; it 's Maud ,  --  her letters to me ; every one of them showing she ca n't understand , although she 's trying so hard to ; that she thinks I 'm throwing my life away , and her 's too , on a whim ; that she has no faith in my ultimate success ; but that her love is so great she will stick to me till the end  --  to a lost cause , a forlorn hope . ( He hides his face in his hands with a groan . ) Oh , it 's hell to love and be loved by a girl who ca n't understand ; who , you know , tries to and can not ; who loves you , and whose life you are making miserable and unhappy by trying to be true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sympathetic understanding ) If you feel that way , there 's only one thing to do ; go back home , get married , save up your money for awhile and then come back again when your mind is free once more . Or else  --  give up the girl for good and all . NELSON That 's the idea ! JOHN What would life be worth if I gave her up ? HARRINGTON Then go back to her . JOHN I ca n't go back  --  now . NELSON Why , look here , at the end of six months or a year at the salary you 'll get from father-in-law you ought to save enough to stay down here for an age . JOHN You forget Maud . NELSON It 'll be different after you 're married . She 's sure to understand you better then . She 'll take a selfish interest in trying to help you become something higher than a small town shop keeper . HARRINGTON There ! You ought to be convinced now ! Listen to the pitiless dissector of women 's souls , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , passion , and divorce . If anyone can predict the vagaries of the " female of the species " , surely he can . NELSON ( laughing ) I 'm a grand little predicter. p. 63 JOHN I 'd be proving myself a cowardly weakling by giving in like that  --  and you know it . HARRINGTON You 'd be showing more sense than you have in a long time . NELSON Coward ? Nonsense ! It 's just like this : There 's no use slaving away at a job that 's disgusting to you for the sole purpose of earning enough to live on . You do n't have to do it , and you 're only ruining your health and accumulating a frame of mind where you think the world hates you . If you had any time or energy to paint , it would be another thing . You 'll have plenty of time up there and your mind wo n't be in such a rut . JOHN It 's useless for you to try and argue with me . I ca n't  --  and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a confessed failure ! Is that what you advise me to do ? Another thing ; I know the conditions in Bridgetown , and you do n't . You do n't consider how I hate the town and how hostile all the surroundings are , when you talk of all the painting I could do . No . I 've got to stay here , sink or swim . ( A knock on the door . Babe Carter and Bessie enter . Bessie has matured from a girl into a very pretty woman since the night in Bridgetown when John announced his engagement . Her face has grown seriously thoughtful but her smile is as ready as ever . She looks much slenderer , in her blue tailor-made suit , stylish but severely simple . Babe has on a blue serge suit and carries a straw hat in his hand. ) p. 64 CARTER Hello , folks ! We were on our way to the Museum and thought we 'd drop in . NELSON Welcome to the Newlyweds ! ( All exchange greetings . Bessie goes over and sits down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) CARTER What was all the argument about when we came in ? JOHN They 're trying to persuade me to return to Bridgetown . Think of it ! NELSON John was bewailing his rotten job and his having no time or inclination for real work ; and he was feeling love-sick and lonely for a certain young lady , so we suggested  --  JOHN That I go back to Bridgetown . A fine remedy , that ! Ask Bessie what I 'd have to contend with up there . She knows . ( to Bessie ) I told them they did n't understand conditions or they would n't give me any such advice . Am I right ? BESSIE You are  --  even more so than you realize . JOHN What do you mean ? BESSIE Oh , nothing ; only do n't go back whatever you do ; anything rather than that  --  even your horrible position on the dock . JOHN Thats just what I told them . HARRINGTON We were n't thinking so much about Bridgetown . We had an idea that if John were married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has lost ; and since it 's impossible for him to get married or paint down here we urged Bridgetown as a necessary evil . p. 65 NELSON That 's it . CARTER I 'm not so sure you 're wrong there , myself . JOHN ( reproachfully ) What ! " Et tu Brute . " CARTER You 're not satisfied here ; you 're brooding and worrying and drudging yourself to death without accomplishing anything . Once married , your whole attitude toward Bridgetown might change ; and with an easy mind you can paint there as well as anywhere else . BESSIE You 're wrong , all of you . JOHN Thanks , Bessie . BESSIE My advice is : Do n't get married . CARTER Oh , come now , that 's pretty hard on me . I hope you 're not speaking from experience . BESSIE Foolish ! Of course , I mean in John 's case . JOHN ( puzzled ) You do n't think it wise for me to marry Maud ? BESSIE I certainly do not . JOHN But why ? Because I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it was n't the one I had in mind . JOHN What did you have in mind ? BESSIE I ca n't explain very well . It 's more of a feeling than a real , good reason . I know Maud so well  --  much better than you do , John , although you 'll probably never admit that  --  and I know you so well  --  much better than you know yourself ; and you wo n't admit that either  --  and that 's my reason . p. 66 JOHN ( indignantly ) You do n't believe we love each other ? BESSIE Oh , yes I do . JOHN Then why should n't we marry ? BESSIE Do n't get so excited about it . My opinion is very likely all wrong . JOHN I should hope so . You were taking a stand exactly like father 's in regard to you and Babe . That is n't like you , Bessie . BESSIE It does seem that way , does n't it ? Well , I apologize if I was , for I had no intention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all I said . Do what you want to . Stay here till the last string snaps . And now , let 's change the subject . Have you sold any of those drawings of yours ? JOHN ( despondently ) No . I have n't had much chance to go around with them . The editor at Colpers Weekly seemed a little impressed and promised to consider them further , and bear me in mind for illustrating ; but I have n't heard from him since . BESSIE If he 's going to bear you in mind , that 's encouraging , at any rate . HARRINGTON I 've been trying to convince John those drawings are salable , and all he has to do is push them ; but he wo n't hear of it . ( to Babe ) You saw them , did n't you ? p. 67 CARTER Yes , he showed them to me . HARRINGTON Do n't you think I 'm right . CARTER I sure do . JOHN ( brightening up ) Well , lets hope you 're both right . It would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They represent the best I 've got in me at that sort of work . BESSIE Well , Babe , we better be going . ( to Steve ) May I use your mirror ? CARTER O vanity ! HARRINGTON Go ahead . I do n't think there 's anything in there that should n't be seen . ( Bessie goes across to the kitchinette . ) CARTER Wo n't you fellows come over to the Museum with us ? NELSON Excuse me ! Not today . I feel far from well . CARTER Morning after , eh ? Wo n't you come , John ? BESSIE ( from inside the kitchinette ) Yes , do come , John . JOHN No , I 'm going to try and work a bit . ( He gets up and goes over in front of the easel and stands looking at the unfinished painting . ) Besides , I 'm not dressed , or shaved , or anything fit to be seen with a lady . p. 68 HARRINGTON Well , if I wo n't be too much of a number three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bessie comes out of the kitchinette . Babe goes toward the door . Steve gets his straw hat from the kitchinette and follows Babe . ) BESSIE ( going to John ) Come along , John . We 'll wait while you change clothes . You look all worn out and the fresh air will do you good . JOHN No ; this is the only day I have and I must try to work at least . BESSIE You do n't look at all well lately , do you know it ? JOHN I do n't get much sleep . BESSIE ( looking at him searchingly ) You 're sure you 're not letting your troubles drive you to drink , or anything like that ? JOHN ( irritably ) No no , of course not ! What ideas you get into your head . BESSIE I knew it was n't so . JOHN What was n't so ? CARTER ( from the door ) Coming Bess ? BESSIE Oh , nothing ; just something I overheard . ( She kisses him impulsively and walks quickly to door . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Babe. ) p. 69 JOHN ( stares at the painting for a moment ; then turns away impatiently ) What 's the use of this pretence ? I do n't want to paint . ( He goes and sits down by Ted again . ) Did you hear what Bessie just said ? NELSON No . JOHN Asked me if I 'd been drinking ; said she overheard something to that effect . NELSON ( shrugging his shoulders ) They say that about everybody who ever drank one glass of beer . Revengeful people with Brights Disease start those reports . Necessity is an awful virtue breeder . JOHN Damned luck ! I do n't want her to loose faith in me . NELSON I suppose you denied it ? JOHN Of course ; what else could I do ? NELSON Confess you drank when you felt like it . Your sister is n't a prude . She 'd simply tell you not to overdo it . JOHN But that 's what she insinuated  --  that I was overdoing it . NELSON Everyone who drinks overdoes it sometimes . Speaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a bottle hidden in yonder kitchinette . ( He walks over to the kitchinette . ) You 'll have a hair of the dog , wo n't you ? p. 70 JOHN No , I 'm going to cut it out . NELSON ( from inside ) Got the R.E.s ? JOHN ( fidgetting nervously ) Oh , I guess I will have one after all . There 's no use playing the Spartan . NELSON Right you are . ( He comes out with three glasses , one full of water , and lays them on the table ; then takes a pint of whiskey from his pocket and uncorks it ; places it on the table beside glasses . ) My lord , breakfast is served . ( sings ) " Ho , shun the flowing cup ! " Better come along , Jonathan . ( John goes to table and pours out a drink . Ted does the same . ) NELSON Top o ' the morning ! ( raises his glass ) JOHN ( with sudden resolution pours his drink back into the bottle ) No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got to quit , that 's all there is to it ; and it might as well be now as anytime . NELSON As you like , senor . Skoll ! ( He tosses down his drink ; then makes a wry face . ) Ugh ! We must have been down on the water front when we did our shopping last night . ( John laughs ; goes over to the easel and picks up his palette and brushes , and stands squinting at the painting critically . Ted takes out a box of cigarettes and lights one . ) Have a cigarette ? p. 71 JOHN No thanks . NELSON You 're the slave of a fixed idea today . You 're going to work whether you feel like it or not . JOHN ( laying down his brushes after making a few halfhearted dabs at the canvas ) You 're right ; I do n't feel like eating , or drinking , or smoking  --  or painting . ( A timid knock on the door is heard . ) NELSON Who can that be ? JOHN ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Get that stuff out of the way . ( Ted hurries into the kitchinette with them and returns . The knock at the door is repeated , this time a little louder . ) NELSON Come in ! ( The door is heard slowly opening and a girls voice asks in frightened tones : " Does John Brown live here ? " ) JOHN ( stunned for a moment , rushes to the door ) Maud ! ( He disappears behind the corner of the kitchinette . ) You , too , Mother ! What in the name of goodness brings you here ? Come in , come in ! ( Ted hides in the kitchinette as they enter the studio . A moment later the door is heard closing as he makes his escape . John leads his mother to a seat by the table . She is very frightened by her strange surroundings , and keeps her eyes resolutely down cast from the nudes on the walls . She does not seem to have aged or changed a particle  --  even her dress looks like the same . Maud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years which have elapsed . Her face is still full of a spoiled wilfulness , but it is much less marked in character than before . She is stylishly dressed in white and looks very charming. ) p. 72 JOHN ( taking Maud in his arms and kissing her ) Oh , Maudie , it 's so good to see you again ! You 'll pardon us , Mother , I hope ? MRS . BROWN ( with an embarrassed smile ) Oh , do n't mind me . MAUD Why , you 're all over with paint ! Just look at him , Mrs. Brown . Look at your face . You 're like an Indian in war-paint. ( carefully examining the front of her dress ) I do hope you have n't got any of it on my dress . JOHN No , you 're as spotless as when you entered . MRS . BROWN Hm  --  You have n't been working today , have you , John ?  --  Sunday ? JOHN It 's the only day I have free for painting , Mother . MRS . BROWN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you  --  dressed like that ? Why I do believe you have n't any socks on ! JOHN The people who call here do n't judge you by your clothes . MAUD Oh , Mrs. Brown , I think he looks so picturesque  --  just like the people you read about in the Paris Latin Quarter . MRS . BROWN But on a Sunday ! JOHN Nonsense , Mother , this is n't Bridgetown. p. 73 MAUD ( who is walking around looking at the paintings ) Everything looks the same as the last time I was here : still the same shocking old pictures . ( stops before the picture of an old hag ) Oh ! Is this one of yours ? Is n't she horrid ! How could you ever do it ? JOHN ( bruskely ) She really looked that way , you know . ( abruptly changing the subject ) But you have n't told me yet what happy chance brings you down here . ( Maud sits down on the window-seat . ) MRS . BROWN Hm  --  , Edward came with us ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coldly ) Oh , is he ? But what are you down for  --  a shopping trip ? MRS . BROWN ( nervously ) Yes ,  --  hm , of course we expect to do some shopping tomorrow before we  --  you know we 're going back tomorrow night  --  hm  --  but I can hardly say  --  hm , shopping was not the  --  hm  --  ( She becomes miserably confused and turns to Maud beseachingly . ) MAUD Perhaps I better tell him ? MRS . BROWN ( immensely relieved ) Yes , do . p. 74 MAUD Its a long story , John , and you must promise not to interrupt . JOHN I promise . MAUD Well , your mother has been terribly worried about you ; and I 've been worried to death about you , too . JOHN ( tenderly ) Maudie ! MAUD Sssshhh ! You promised not to interrupt . Your father , too  --  we 've all been so afraid something had happened to you . JOHN But my letters to you ? MAUD No interruptions , you promised . I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep me from worrying ; and you were . You said you never felt better or more contented , and I could tell the moment I saw you that was n't so . You look frightfully worn out and ill ; does n't he , Mrs. Brown ? MRS . BROWN He does n't look at all well . JOHN ( impatiently ) Its nothing . I 've been troubled with insomnia , thats all . MAUD Then you see you 're not contented and you were telling fibs . Do n't look so impatient ! I 'm coming to the rest of the story . Your mother was making herself ill wondering if you were starving with the army of the unemployed or something of that sort ; and I was tearing my hair at the thought that you had fallen in love with some beautiful model and  --  p. 75 JOHN Maudie ! MAUD You know your letters have been getting fewer and fewer , and each one shorter than the last . I did n't know what to think . JOHN I could n't write much . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to bore you with my disappointments . I was waiting for good news to tell you ; then I 'd have written a long letter , you can be sure of that . But what you said about models  --  most of them are n't beautiful , you know  --  you do n't believe anything like that ? MAUD Silly boy ! Of course I was only joking . Anyway , your mother and I made up this expedition  --  with your father 's permission  --  got Edward to come with us , and hurried down to this wicked old city  --  to rescue you ! JOHN To rescue me ! MAUD Yes ; you 've just simply got to stop breaking people 's hearts and homes . We 're going to take you back to Bridgetown , a prisoner . ( John walks up and down nervously . ) Then we 'll be able to keep an eye on you and see that you do n't starve or get sick . JOHN ( annoyed ) Maudie ! MAUD Dad told me to tell you he had just the nicest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off at least one afternoon a week if you care to keep up your painting . We can announce our wedding right away , and we 'll be married in the fall or ( looking at him shyly ) even sooner , if you like . I 've picked out just the most adorable little house and Dad 's agreed to give us that for a wedding present . ( John is striding backward and forward his hands clenched tightly behind him . He keeps his head lowered and does not look at Maud . ) And your father  --  he has the dandiest surprise in store for you ; only I 'm not to tell you about it . Is n't it all fine ? ( John groans but does not answer her . Maud is troubled by his silence . ) You 'll come with us , wo n't you ? p. 76 JOHN ( brokenly ) Maudie  --  you know  --  I ca n't . MAUD ( her lips trembling , her eyes filling with tears ) You wo n't come ! JOHN I 'd like to , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do as you ask  --  I love you so much  --  you know that  --  but  --  Oh , do n't you understand ! you must realize in your heart  --  why I ca n't . ( There is a long pause . Maud turns and stares down at the street below , winking back her tears . ) MRS . BROWN ( wiping her eyes with her handkerchief ) Do n't decide so soon , Johnnie . Think over it . ( with a desperate attempt to change the subject before the question is irrevocably decided ) Have you seen Bessie lately ? JOHN Yes ; today ; just before you came . She stopped in with Babe . MRS . BROWN She 's well , I hope ? JOHN Never better , and just as happy as she can be . She and Babe are getting along in fine shape . MRS . BROWN That 's good news , I 'm sure ;  --  hm ,  --  is n't it , Maud ? MAUD ( coldly ) I 'm glad to hear it . ( There is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That must be Edward . JOHN ( gruffly ) Come in . ( The door is opened and Edward enters . He seems less pompous and more self-assured than in Act 1 . In appearance he is practically unchanged . His clothes are a model of sober immaculateness . ) EDWARD Here you are , I see . ( coldly ) How are you , John ? ( They shake hands in a perfunctory manner . Edward casts a disapproving glance around the room . His eyes finally rest on John 's paint-stained clothes . There is a trace of scorn in his manner . ) I must say you look the part of the artist . JOHN ( with a sneer ) I dare say . You ca n't paint and keep clean . I suppose it 's much the same in politics . EDWARD ( stiffening ) We will not discuss that . Are you still employed on the dock ? JOHN Yes . EDWARD Have you sold any pictures yet ? JOHN No . EDWARD Is it an artistic custom to work on Sunday ? JOHN We work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As I reminded Mother , You 're in New York now , not Bridgetown . ( Edward turns to his mother . She persistently avoids his eyes. ) p. 78 EDWARD ( after a long pause ) Well , Mother , is the purpose of this visit fulfilled ? MRS . BROWN Hm  --  ; yes  --  er  --  you might say ,  --  hm ; but no ,  --  you 'd hardly call it  --  EDWARD ( turns impatiently to Maud ) Have you told him , Maud ? MAUD ( dully ) Yes . EDWARD And he 's coming with us , of course ? MAUD ( with difficulty ) No ; he wo n't come . ( She raises her handkerchief to her eyes and commences to cry softly . ) JOHN ( starting to go to her ) Maudie , please ! EDWARD ( stopping him ) Is this true ? JOHN ( defiantly ) Quite true . EDWARD Then all I have to say is , you are guilty of the most shameless ingratitude , not only to your own family , but particularly to Maud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you and this is the way you repay us . MRS . BROWN Edward ! EDWARD Let me speak , Mother ; it 's time someone brought John to his senses . He has been riding rough-shod over all of us for years . Its my duty to show him the wreck he is making of his own life . p. 79 JOHN By all means do your duty , Mr. Alderman . Let me hear what you have to say . EDWARD Did Maud tell you of her father 's offer and of all that will be done for you ? JOHN Yes . EDWARD You have sold no pictures and you have no hope of selling any . JOHN Very little , at present . EDWARD You still support yourself as a checker on the docks and only get twelve dollars a week ? JOHN Exactly . EDWARD And you refuse to come back ! Have you no heart ? Can you see Maud weeping with the unhappiness you cause her by your selfish obstinacy and still refuse ? MAUD ( starting to her feet , her eyes flashing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excited ) Yes , I can refuse , for Maud 's sake most of all . Would you have me give up like a craven ; be untrue to my highest hope ; slink home a self-confessed failure ? Would you have Maud married to such a moral coward ? You , with your bread and butter viewpoint of life , probably ca n't appreciate such feelings but  --  EDWARD There is no more to be said . I call upon you to witness , Mother , that I have done all in my power to persuade John to return . p. 80 JOHN Wait a minute ; I begin to see things clearly . I begin to see through your canting pose about duty . Do n't think you can fool me with your moral platitudes , your drivel about my ingratitude ; for I think  --  no , by God , I 'm sure ,  --  you 're only too glad I did refuse . EDWARD ( in great confusion ) I ? I protest , Mother ,  --  MRS . BROWN AND MAUD Johnnie ! John ! JOHN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ! EDWARD ( growing red ) Why should I be glad ? It 's of no importance to me  --  JOHN Because right down in your heart you think my refusal will end things between Maud and me and give you another chance . MAUD Oh , John , how can  --  ( Mrs. Brown is beyond speech . ) EDWARD ( summoning all his dignity ) I will not deny that I want to see Maud happy . JOHN ( with a loud forced laugh ) But you do n't think she 'll be happy with anyone but you ! Well spoken , Mr. Platitude ! It 's the first real manly thing I 've ever heard you say  --  the only time I 've ever known you not to play the sanctimonious hypocrite. p. 81 EDWARD ( raging ) How dare you  --  MRS . BROWN Do stop , Edward ! MAUD John , please  --  EDWARD I will tell you this . I do not think you a fit husband for Maud ; for I think I know the real reason for your refusal to come home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And what is this reason ? EDWARD You are mixed up with some woman down here and  --  JOHN ( white with fury ) Liar ! ( He strikes Edward in the face with his fist almost knocking him down . Maud steps in between them . Mrs. Brown goes to Edward . ) MRS . BROWN Now , Edward , for my sake ! MAUD John , this is disgraceful  --  your own brother ! EDWARD All right , Mother , I forgive him for striking me , but I retract nothing . ( He walks toward door . ) Are you coming with me ? MRS . BROWN Yes , yes . Good'bye Johnnie . I 'll be in tomorrow before we go  --  hm  --  or you telephone to the hotel , will you ? JOHN Yes , Mother . ( He kisses her . She joins Edward near the door. ) p. 82 EDWARD Are you coming , Maud ? MAUD Yes . JOHN Maudie ! MAUD Do n't speak to me ! JOHN ( in desperation ) But you do n't  --  you ca n't  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Oh , how can you act so ! I do n't know what to believe . JOHN This is the end , then . MAUD Yes . ( She walks past him to the others at the door . They go out . John flings himself face downward on the divan near the piano . His shoulders shake as if he were sobbing . After about a minute the door is flung open and Maud rushes in . John starts up from the divan and she runs into his arms . ) MAUD ( between sobs ) You do care ! You 've been crying ! Oh , please Johnnie dear , come back with us . Please if you love me . I do love you so much ! Wo n't you please do this for my sake  --  just this once for my sake  --  I love you  --  I do n't want you down here  --  I do n't believe what Edward said  --  but still it might happen if you never saw me . If you love me , wo n't you please for my sake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right  --  I 'll come back  --  for your sake . p. 83 MAUD Promise ? JOHN I promise . ( He kisses her . ) MAUD Oh , I 'm so glad . We 're just going to be so happy , are n't we , dear ? ( John kisses her again. ) @x SCENE  --  The sitting-room of John Brown 's home in Bridgetown , a little before one o'clock on a fine July day two years later . In the extreme left foreground a door leading to the dining-room . Farther back a projecting chimney papered over , and an open fire-place with black andirons . Above , a mantle on which is a brass clock flanked by a china vase on either end . Beyond the fireplace an arm chair stands stiffly against the wall . Still farther back a door leading to the hall . The door is pushed back against the far wall . Next to the door a chair , then a window opening on the verandah , a long sofa , another window , and in the corner a wicker-work rocking chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window looking out on the street , a piano with a stool placed before it , and a music stand piled with sheets of music . Finally in the extreme right foreground another window with a round table in front and to the left of it . On the table a lace center-piece and a potted maidenhair fern . The hardwood floor is almost completely hidden by a large rug . In the center of the room a table with wicker-work rocking chairs around it . On the table an electric reading-lamp wired from the chandeler , and a Sunday newspaper . The windows are all lace-curtained . The walls are papered in dark green . In startling incongruity with the general commonplace aspect of the room are two paintings in the Impressionist style , a landscape and a seascape , one of which hangs over the mantle and the other over the piano . The front door is heard opening and closing and Maud and Edward enter from the hall . Her two years of married life have told on Maud . She is still pretty but has faded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about her eyes and mouth , and wears the air of one who has been cheated in the game of life and knows it ; but will even up the scale by making those around her as wretched as possible . Her Sunday gown is so gay and pretty she looks almost out of place in it . Edward , too , has aged perceptibly , but his general appearance is practically the same . He is dressed after his usual faultlessly-staid fashion . MAUD So good of you to walk home with me . You must sit down for a while . It 's been ages since we 've had a talk together . ( She sits down by the table. ) p. 85 EDWARD ( taking a chair near the table ) Thank you , I will ; but only for a moment . MAUD How can you rush off so after all the time it 's been since you were here before ! You are n't very considerate of your friends . EDWARD ( gravely ) You know , Maud , you would never have to complain of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bitter dislike ,  --  I might more truthfully call it hatred . He would surely misinterpret my visits ; as he did when he practically put me out of this house six months ago . MAUD ( her face hardening ) I told John at that time , and I tell you now , Edward , this is my house and my friends are always welcome in it . EDWARD Of course , Maud , of course ; but then I like to avoid all such unpleasantness ,  --  for your sake , especially . MAUD A little more or less would n't make much difference ; but let 's not talk of that . Why , I have n't even congratulated you yet , Mr. Congressman ! EDWARD ( flushing with pleasure ) Oh , nothing 's decided yet ,  --  definitely . Of course I will take the nomination if it 's offered to me ,  --  as I 'm quite sure it will be ; but getting elected is another matter . p. 86 MAUD How can you have any doubts after your wonderful victory in the election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave anyone in the history of the town , was n't it ? EDWARD Oh yes , but this is entirely different ,  --  the whole district , you see ; and in some parts of it I 'm hardly known at all . MAUD I know you 'll be elected , so there ! ( Edward smiles but shakes his head . ) Will you make a bet ? A pair of gloves against a box of cigars ,  --  real cigars ; you can pick them out yourself . You 're afraid ! I wo n't tell on you for gambling . EDWARD Oh now , Maud , what difference does  --  MAUD Is it done ? EDWARD Done . MAUD I wo n't have to buy any gloves then . What will come after the Congressman ? Will it be governor or senator ? EDWARD ( immensely pleased , bows to her smilingly ) You are altogether too flattering , my dear Maud . MAUD ( suddenly becoming melancholy ) Oh , it must be fine to keep going upward step by step and getting somewhere , instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of advancement . You are known all over the state now and you 'll soon be going to Washington , and after that ,  --  who knows ? While to us , Bridgetown is the whole world . Promise you wo n't forget all about us when you leave ? p. 87 EDWARD ( earnestly ) You know I could never forget you , Maud . MAUD When you go to Washington  --  EDWARD I have n't got there yet . MAUD But you will . Then you 'll forget all us poor , unhappy small-town people . EDWARD Unhappy ? MAUD Certainly not happy . EDWARD No , you are not happy . It shows in all your actions . Has John  --  Where is he now ? MAUD Still in bed . EDWARD What ! Is he sick ? MAUD ( bitterly ) People who do n't come in until three in the morning usually are . EDWARD You do n't mean to say he does n't  --  MAUD Oh , it 's only on Saturday nights when he goes to the club to meet Harry and the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ club was speaking to me about this ; said I 'd better give John a word of advice . Of course he did n't know of our  --  er  --  strained relations . He said John was drinking altogether too much ,  --  getting to be a regular thing with him . p. 88 MAUD He could n't know about that . John only goes to the club on Saturday nights ; but he drinks quite a lot here at home . EDWARD Why do n't you speak to him ? MAUD I have ; but he only laughs , and then we have another quarrel . That 's all it is ,  --  fight , fight , fight . He says he drinks to give life a false interest since it has no real one . EDWARD To say that to you ! How can you stand it ? MAUD I do n't stand it . My patience is worn out . When he is with me I ca n't restrain myself . I fight ; and he fights back ; and there you are . EDWARD Too bad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you above all people ; your home life with your father was always so ideal . MAUD Oh , you have n't heard the worst of it . Do you know , I even heard that John was associating with those low friends of Harry 's ,  --  women , I mean . EDWARD Good heavens ! MAUD ( looking at him searchingly ) You have heard something of this ; tell me truthfully , have n't you ? EDWARD ( hesitating ) Oh , mere rumors ; you know what the town is. p. 89 MAUD Ah . EDWARD ( after a pause ) I can not tell how it grieves me to see you in this state . I always had fears that John would fail in his duties as a husband . He has no stability , no  --  er  --  will power , as you might say . But to insult you in this gross manner is unthinkable . MAUD Have you no advice to give me ? EDWARD You say you have urged him to reform his mode of living and he refuses ? That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  er  --  women keep coming to you . MAUD Yes yes , I hear all sorts of things . EDWARD Hm  --  , where there 's so much smoke , you know  --  MAUD But what shall I do ? EDWARD ( with an air of decision ) I advise you to sue for a divorce . MAUD ( astonished ) You , Edward , you think I ought  --  EDWARD I know it 's quite against my principles . I have always held divorce to be the greatest evil of modern times and a grave danger to the social life of the nation ; but there are cases  --  and yours is one of them  --  where there seems to be no other solution . Therefore I repeat , I advise you to free yourself from one who has proved himself so unworthy ; and you know I have your interests at heart when I say it . p. 90 MAUD Oh , I ca n't ; it 's impossible . EDWARD Why ? You have no children . MAUD No , thank God ! EDWARD You would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could n't do it . EDWARD Surely you no longer care for him after  --  all you 've told me . MAUD No ,  --  but ,  --  Oh , I do n't know ! EDWARD Pardon me if the question I am about to ask seems indelicate . It is to your interest to face facts . Are you still living with him  --  as his wife ? MAUD Oh , you know I could n't ! How could you think so  --  after those reports . EDWARD Then why do you hesitate ? Is it for his sake ? MAUD ( fiercely ) Indeed not ! He 'd be only too glad to get rid of me . He 'd be married again in a week ,  --  to that horrible , divorced Mrs. Harper or some other of those rich summer people who are always inviting him to their houses and who think he 's so fascinating . No , I 'll not play into his hands by getting a divorce ; you can say what you like . EDWARD ( gets up and goes over beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are making yourself sick both in mind and body by remaining in such distressing environment . ( He takes one of her hands . She makes no effort to withdraw it . ) Listen to me , Maud . I love you , as you know . I have always loved you ever since I can remember having loved anyone . Let me take care of your future . Do as I have advised and I will protect you from everything that could possibly hurt you . I ask nothing for myself . My love for you has always been an unselfish one . I only want to see you happy , and to do all in my power to make you so . If , in after years , you could come to love me ever so little  --  you would be free  --  with such a hope my life would be  --  p. 91 MAUD ( her face averted ) Do n't , do n't , I ca n't bear it . EDWARD Will you promise to consider what I have suggested ? MAUD Yes . ( John appears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is collarless , unshaven , and has on a faded bathrobe and bedroom slippers . He has grown stout and his face is flabby and pasty-complected , his eyes dull and lusterless . He watches his wife and brother with a cynical smile . ) EDWARD From the bottom of my heart I thank you . ( He raises Maud 's hand to his lips . ) JOHN " Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor 's wife . " ( Maud screams . Edward straightens up with a jerk , his face crimson . ) You seem to be forgetting the Lord 's commandments on his own day , my worthy deacon . ( Edward stutters in confusion . ) Never try to make love , Edward . You look a fearful ass ; and remember Maud is expressly forbidden to covet such animals in that same commandment . Sorry to disturb you . I 'll cough the next time . ( He turns around and goes out . ) EDWARD ( furiously ) The scoundrel ! MAUD Now you see what he 's like . p. 92 EDWARD I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I really ca n't contain myself ; I would n't be responsible  --  ( He goes to door , then stops and turns to Maud . ) Good'bye ; you wo n't forget your promise , Maud ? MAUD I wo n't forget . ( Edward goes out . The outer door slams and he can be seen walking past the windows . Maud throws herself on the sofa and lies sobbing with her face buried in the pillows . John enters . ) JOHN Has the Passionate Pilgrim gone ? ( He sits down by the table . ) Why all this fuss ? You know I was only joking . I just wanted to take some of the moral starch out of that pompous ass . ( He takes up the newspaper and starts to read . It trembles in his shaking hand with an irritating rustling sound . Maud glances sharply at him with keen dislike in her eyes , opens her lips as if to say something , checks herself , taps the floor nervously with her foot , and finally bursts out ) MAUD A nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you know it 's Sunday ? ( She pulls down shades of windows open on veranda . ) JOHN What of it ? MAUD At least you might put on a collar and shave yourself . p. 93 JOHN I might ; but I 'm not going to . What 's the matter ? Do you expect other callers ? MAUD You never know who might come in on a Sunday . JOHN ( giving up the attempt to read by putting down his paper , speaks with nervous irritation ) But I know who wo n't come in  --  anyone of the slightest interest to me . If anyone comes I 'll run and hide and you can tell them I 'm out . They 'll all be glad to hear it . Say I have n't come back from church yet ; that ought to be scandal enough for one day . MAUD You mock at everything decent . However they all know where you are when you 're out . You are n't fooling anybody and you need n't think you are . JOHN Ah . MAUD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You forget , my dear , this is the Sabbath and all such dens of iniquity are closed by law of our God-fearing legislature  --  the front doors at least . MAUD Then you 'd be up at the club with your drunken friends . JOHN ( flushing ) I would be ; and I soon will be if you do n't give up this constant nagging . MAUD Then come home at a decent hour . Act like a respectable man should and there wo n't be any nagging . p. 94 JOHN You could n't keep that promise . You 've got the habit . You 'd pick on me for something else . My drinking is only an excuse . There are plenty of so-called respectable citizens who drink more than I do ; and you ought to know it if your gossiping friends ever air their malicious scandal about anyone but me . MAUD I have heard of one other . JOHN One ? There is hope then . MAUD Your brother Harry . JOHN Harry 's open about what he does and makes no pretence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those psalmsinging hypocrites of whom my respected brother Edward is the leader . MAUD Edward is a gentleman . JOHN Edward is a fool and ( as she is about to retort ) we will talk no more about him . I feel bad enough already without having to sit and listen while you din the praises of that pompous nincompoop into my ears . ( He picks up the paper again and goes through it hurriedly ; finally finds page and begins reading . His hand shakes more than ever and the paper rustles until Maud turns to him sharply . ) MAUD For goodness sake , do n't rustle that paper so . JOHN The excitement of quarrelling with my sweet wife has unnerved me. p. 95 MAUD Last night unnerved you , you mean . Why did n't you phone you were n't coming home to dinner ? You knew I would wait . JOHN I told you never to wait after seven . Why will you persist in doing so and then blame me for it . MAUD You must think I like to eat alone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You were at the club , I suppose ? You always say that . JOHN And where would I be ? MAUD You need n't look so innocent . I 've heard things . JOHN You always do . What things ? MAUD Have you had any breakfast yet ? JOHN Damn breakfast ! What is it you 've heard this time from your select circle of the towns finest ? MAUD They say you do n't always spend your evenings at the club ; that you 've been seen with some of those low women Harry associates with . JOHN And you allow them to say such things ? MAUD I told them there could n't be any truth in such stories . JOHN ( ironically ) I thank you for your trust in me . I expected you to say you did believe them . p. 96 MAUD I do n't know what to believe . When a person drinks so much they 're liable to do anything . JOHN That 's all nonsense , Maud . MAUD And that trip of yours to New York last month when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . JOHN And she was n't ; she and Babe were out of town . MAUD Someone said they saw you down there with some woman . JOHN Oh , for God 's sake , Maud ! ( He gets up and strides nervously around the room . A knocking is heard from the rear of the house . ) MAUD There 's someone at the back door ; and Annie 's out , of course . ( She hurries out through the door to hall . John looks around furtively for a moment ; then walks to dining-room door and goes in . He returns a moment later with a syphon of seltzer and a bottle of whiskey , and placing them on the table , mixes himself a drink . Maud comes back as he is drinking . She stands watching him with an expression of disgust . ) MAUD Ca n't you leave that horrible stuff alone for a moment ? JOHN ( rather shamefacedly ) Just a little pick-me-up . MAUD ( sinking into a chair ) It 's terrible . p. 97 JOHN Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take a cocktail before breakfast . MAUD I do n't know what will happen to us if you keep on this way . JOHN You forget , my dear , your tongue is calculated to drive anyone to drink ; and things are n't as bad as you 'd like to pretend . I see lots of people more unfortunate than you . Every little thing that happens you weep and wail as if the world were coming to an end . Why , in God 's name , did you ever marry me ? MAUD If I could have seen how things would be I 'd never  --  JOHN Nor I ; I gave up a career for you ; and you gave up the righteous citizen Edward for me . We were both very foolish . MAUD ( stung by this mention of Edward ) Yes , Edward loved me , and in spite of all your superior sneers he 's a better man than you are . All the town looks up to him . He got more votes for Mayor than anyone ever did before . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ; and everyone knows he 's sure of going to Congress . JOHN I do n't know which to sympathize with  --  Congress or Edward . MAUD ( furiously ) That 's right ; sneer ! Sneer at everything and everyone ; all failures do that . Yes , failure ! I said it and I mean it . If it was n't for my father we would n't even have this house ; and if you were n't my husband , you could n't keep your position in the store a single day longer . Father told me that himself . He said you were n't worth a bit more to the business now than the day you came in . He said you took absolutely no interest in it at all . p. 98 JOHN He 's right , there . MAUD Then why do you stay in it ? ( John shruggs his shoulders but does not answer . He is very pale . ) Because you know you 'd never get a job anywhere else . You might at least be grateful to him for what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do is sneer at him and his business . You pretend to be too artistic to lower yourself to make money ; but I see through your high-art pose . You never made a success of that either . Oh , I do n't know how I stand it . JOHN ( turning to her quickly ) Ah , now you ask the leading question . Why do you stand it ? MAUD What do you mean ? JOHN Simply this : You 've stated the truth . Our life together is impossible and the sooner we recognize that fact and do what we can to rectify it , the better for both of us . We 're young and life may still hold something pleasant if we 've only the courage to break our chains . When nothing is left of the old love but wrangling and distrust , it 's high time for us to give up this farce of life together . MAUD You mean divorce ? JOHN Yes . Let 's be frank . You hate me and I confess I  --  but no matter . Such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God 's world why we should be confined together like two cats in a bag ? Get a divorce ! I 'll gladly give you all the evidence you need . p. 99 MAUD I do n't doubt that for a moment . JOHN Remember you 're young ,  --  and Edward is still a bachelor . I 'm sure he 'd provide balm for your woes , even if his political career suffered from his marrying a divorced woman . I give him credit for being red-blooded in that one respect at least . ( a pause during which Maud bites her lips in nervous anger ) Has n't he spoken to you about a divorce in your conferences together ? MAUD No  --  Yes , why should I deny it ? He has spoken of it , and I absolutely refused to consider it . JOHN And why , if I may ask ? MAUD ( defiantly ) I will never get a divorce ; you understand-never ! JOHN I ca n't see why you want to live with me . MAUD Ca n't you ? Well , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to regard marriage as a sacred thing ; not as something to be thrown aside as soon as one gets tired of it . If I were to get a divorce , think of the scandal , think of what people would say . JOHN As if one cared ! MAUD Well , I do care and I wo n't do it . Do you think I do n't know what 's behind your talk ? You want to get rid of me so you 'll have a chance to run after your Mrs. Harpers , your artists models , and creatures of that sort . I tell you right now I 'll never give you the chance . Disgrace yourself , if you will , but do n't ask me to make your path easy . p. 100 JOHN ( quietly ) Then let 's say no more about it . ( He takes up the paper . Maud fumes and bites her lips . Suddenly John 's eye catches an item in the paper and he gives an exclamation of excitement . ) Here , listen to this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is a criticism of the paintings at the Independent Exhibition . It says : ( reads ) " Mr. Carter is without doubt one of the most promising of the younger school . His work is steadily increasing in worth , and some of his seascapes , notably The Coral Reef , deserve to rank among the best painted in recent years by any American . " ( putting down the paper , his face glowing with enthusiasm ) Great work ! Good old Babe ! What do you think of that , Maud ? Wo n't Bessie be tickled to death when she reads that . MAUD Then she 's still living with him ? JOHN Of course she is . They 're as much in love now as the day they were married . What made you think any differently ? MAUD Things of that sort do n't last long , generally . JOHN Things of what sort ? MAUD Marriages of that kind . JOHN What kind ? I do n't know what you 're talking about . If ever two people were absolutely fitted for each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , I do n't mean that . JOHN What do you mean ? MAUD ( spitefully ) They say he was forced to marry her on account of their previous intimacy . JOHN ( not understanding for a second ; then springing to his feet in a furious rage and standing over her , his fists clenched ) How dare you repeat such a damnable lie ! How dare you  --  MAUD ( genuinely frightened  --  shrinking away from him ) That 's right ; strike me ! It only remains for you to do that . JOHN ( recovering himself ) Strike you ? Are you crazy ? Bah ! Such pitiful slanders are beneath notice . I 'm surprised that you , who pretend to be her friend , should repeat such calumnies . You 're letting your temper carry you beyond all bounds . MAUD I never approved of her meeting Carter in secret . JOHN But you know there 's no truth in what you said as well  --  as ( He is interrupted by a ring of the door-bell . ) MAUD There ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that dirty bath-robe and not even shaved . ( She goes cautiously to the window and peeks out . ) I think  --  ( in tones of great astonishment ) Yes , it 's Bessie . What can she be doing here ? p. 102 JOHN ( irritably ) Well , why does n't someone go to the door ? MAUD I told you Annie was out . ( The bell rings again . ) JOHN Then I 'll go and , remember , I wo n't allow her to be insulted by you or anyone else . MAUD I refuse to see her . ( She goes out by the door to the dining-room . John strides into the hallway and opens the front door . " Hello , Bessie . " Their voices can be heard exchanging greetings . A moment later Bessie enters with John . What little change she has undergone has been decidedly for the better . An atmosphere of hope fulfilled and happiness attained , which is like an affront to John in his state of nervous melancholia , springs from her person . John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the table . ) BESSIE ( sitting down ) Wheres Maud ? JOHN ( angry at being forced to lie ) Oh , out somewhere , church or someplace . ( He slouches miserably into his chair . ) BESSIE Sorry she 's not here . How is she ? JOHN As usual . BESSIE ( giving him a searching glance  --  quietly ) And you ? p. 103 JOHN Oh , I 'm all right , I suppose . ( a pause  --  suddenly he breaks out with angry impatience ) What rot ! Why should I lie and keep up this pretence to you ? I can at least be frank with you . Nothing is all right . Everything about me has degenerated since you saw me last . My family life is unbearable . Maud hates me and I  --  So much for the soothing atmosphere of our home . BESSIE You 're sure it is n't just an attack of Sabbath blues . JOHN I wish it were . The truth is Maud and I have become disillusioned . I know there 's nothing so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have no doubt , go through the same thing . The trouble with us is we 've gone to the bitter end . There are no veils left to tear off . We 're two corpses chained together . BESSIE It 's too bad . I always thought your marriage would prove a disappointment but I never dreamed it would be as bad as this . I hoped you 'd finally grow used to each other and compromise . ( after a pause  --  musingly ) The pity of it is , you 're neither of you really to blame . It 's simply the conflict of character . You 'll grind together until both are worn out . JOHN You 're right ; Death is the only cure for this marriage . BESSIE ( smiling ) Or divorce . p. 104 JOHN You forget my wife is a good member of the church . She has principles . She remembers the sacred duty of every God-fearing wife toward her husband  --  to make him as miserable as possible . She hates me , but she 'll not forego her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have left , simply because she 's afraid some other woman might claim me . BESSIE Surely she ca n't have become the terrible creature you describe . You have no children  --  JOHN No , thank God ! BESSIE And yet you say she refuses to get a divorce ? JOHN Yes ; we had it all out before you came . She absolutely refused to consider it ; and for the exact reason I 've told you  --  because , although she does n't want me , she 's determined no other woman shall get me . So you see I did n't exaggerate . I 've put the case mildly . There 's no way out . ( with bitter irony ) She 's such a good woman I could never hope to get a divorce from her . BESSIE Why not run away ? I think she 'd soon grow more reasonable if she felt she 'd lost you . JOHN You mistake . That would be just what she desires . As the abandoned wife , the martyr , she would glory in the sympathy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pose for her ever willingly to relinquish . ( He stares moodily before him Bessie looks at him with pitying surprise as if in her state of happiness she could conceive of his misfortune only as something vague and incredible . ) Besides there are other reasons . I have no money . Manna no longer falls from heaven . How would I live ? I only keep my present position , as Maud constantly reminds me , because I 'm Steele 's son-in-law . As a wage-earner I 'm a colossal failure . You know the struggle I had to keep alive when my allowance was withdrawn . It would be a million times worse now . ( despondently ) As I said before there 's no way out but  --  the end . p. 105 BESSIE Nonsense ! Have you done any painting lately ? JOHN None at all . I used to go out on Sundays when I first came up , and do a little . BESSIE You ought to have kept up your drawing , at least ; especially after Colper 's Weekly accepted those things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I received their check the day before I was married ? Oh , if I 'd only had the courage to turn back then ! They asked me if I cared to do some illustrating for them ,  --  and I never answered their letter . You see I was determined for Maud 's sake to put the old life completely behind me . BESSIE But your letters were always so enthusiastic  --  JOHN Oh , I 've lied to you and the rest of the world until I guess noone doubts I 'm the happiest married man on earth . Why , I 've lied even to myself and shut my eyes to the truth . The struggle to appear happy has worn me out . I used to paint a bit , but Maud did n't want me to leave her alone and was bored if she came with me , and I slid deeper and deeper into the rut and gave up altogether . ( He sighs . ) Just plain degeneration , you see . BESSIE ( pointing to the bottle on the table with frank disgust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this degenerating ? p. 106 JOHN ( indifferently ) Oh , I suppose so . BESSIE I thought you never  --  JOHN I never did  --  much , until lately . So you can see it is n't the cause but the result of my degeneration . It makes me callous and lets me laugh at my own futility . That 's about the best I can hope for . BESSIE ( determined to guide the conversation into more pleasant channels ) Speaking about painting , I suppose you 've heard about Harrington ? JOHN No , I have n't heard from Steve in a long time . BESSIE You know he went to Paris . Well , he 's been very successful over there  --  painting in the Salon and I do n't know what else . Babe received a letter from him about two weeks ago , and he wants Babe to come over ; and the best part of it is we 're going . Babe had a streak of unheard-of luck last month and sold three of his paintings . We figure that with this money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remain there a year . Just think of it  --  a year in Paris ! Of course , we 'll have to practice the strictest economy ; but then we 're used to that . We 're going to leave within two weeks at the latest . That 's why I came up . I wanted to see you and say good'bye to the folks before we left . Is n't it fine ? p. 107 JOHN ( trying his best to share in her enthusiasm in spite of the distressing contrast in their fortunes ) I 'm awful glad to hear it , Bess . There 's noone in the world I 'd rather see happy than you and Babe . ( He turns away to hide his emotion . ) BESSIE ( seeing that something is wrong  --  with a sudden intuition runs to him and throws her arms around him ) What a beast I am ! Flaunting our measly success in your face as if I were trying to torment you ! JOHN It 's all right  --  just my damn peevishness . I guess I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blues " after all . BESSIE Listen ; why do n't you come with us ? You can raise enough money for that . It 'll give you a new start . Never mind what anyone thinks . You can come back and square it all later on . It 's a shame to see you going to seed in this beastly old town . JOHN ( after a pause  --  firmly ) No . It would only add one more failure to the list . I have no more confidence in myself . The incentive is gone . Besides you and Babe are just becoming reconciled with the family . They would never forgive you if I went away with you . BESSIE That does n't matter . p. 108 JOHN Oh , yes it does matter ; or it will later on . I just simply ca n't go . Let 's not talk of it . ( Bessie goes slowly over and sits down again . ) What do you hear from Ted ? BESSIE He 's dramatic critic on a Chicago newspaper ; does lots of magazine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though and heaven only knows how long he 'll stand prosperity . Have n't you seen any of his stuff ? JOHN I rarely read any more , magazines or anything else . BESSIE Do n't you hear from any of the old crowd at all ? JOHN They used to write but I never had anything to tell them but my failures so I was too ashamed to answer . ( Bessie can find nothing to say  --  a pause . ) I saw that notice about Babe in todays Times . BESSIE What notice ? JOHN Have n't you seen it ? ( He finds the item and hands it to her . ) Here . It 's the best write-up I 've ever seen them give anyone . BESSIE ( reads the notice , tries to hide her exultation , and contents herself with saying as she lays down the paper ) Very nice of them . JOHN ( gloomily ) They 've all come to the top but me . What would Grammont say if he were still alive . p. 109 BESSIE You talk like an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done with . JOHN It is . BESSIE ( rather weary of his gloom ) Oh , cheer up ! Come out and get the air . Take a walk over to the house with me . By the way , how is everybody ? JOHN They have n't changed a bit , unfortunately . Harry is more human than he used to be , and Edward less human , and Mary more prim ; but the changes are hardly noticeable . BESSIE I gather from mother 's letters Edward is now the hope of the town . JOHN He 's Mayor  --  you know that  --  and he 's going to run for Congress . BESSIE Oh dear ! And I suppose I 'll have to kiss him . JOHN ( with a faint smile ) He 'll deem it your patriotic duty . ( Bessie laughs . ) BESSIE Well , I must go . JOHN Come over tomorrow night . You 'll be here , wo n't you ? BESSIE I 'll stay a couple of days if I can stand it . Come on and walk over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . JOHN No , I 'm not shaved or anything else . I 'll drop over tonight . I do n't feel equal to a dose of Edward 's platitudes this afternoon . ( Bessie walks into the hall followed by John . Their voices can be heard saying " Good ' bye for the present " etc . The door is heard closing and John comes back into the room . He goes to the table and picks up the bottle as if to pour out a drink ; then puts it down again with an exclamation of disgust . He sits down in the chair , his head in his hands , a picture of despondency . Maud enters from the dining room . Her face is twisted with the rage she is holding back only by the most violent effort. ) p. 110 MAUD Your lunch is ready . What made her leave so soon ? JOHN She has n't seen the folks yet . She had to go there . MAUD She 's all dressed up . Carter must be making money . ( John is silent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So they 're going to Paris ? JOHN Ah , I might have known it . MAUD Known what ? JOHN Known you 'd been listening . I hope you 're satisfied with what you heard . Listeners , you know , never hear good of themselves . MAUD ( losing control of herself ) Yes , I listened , you  --  you  --  you beast , you !  --  to tell  --  to talk that way about me  --  about your wife  --  I heard you  --  You said I hated you  --  Well , I do hate you !  --  sponging on my father  --  you drunken good-for-nothing  --  tell her you wanted to get rid of me  --  make fun of me to an outsider  --  What is she I 'd like to know  --  the things I 've heard about her  --  married to poverty-stricken artist who 's no good  --  " Come to Paris with us "  --  Nice advice to give to a married man  --  And you  --  Have you no respect for anything ? JOHN ( very pale , a wild look of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you please let me alone for a while . p. 111 MAUD ( panting in her fury ; her words jumbled out between gasps ) You loafer you !  --  I could n't believe my ears  --  you , to do such a thing  --  She 'll tell everybody  --  She 'll laugh at us  --  and I 'll be to blame  --  She 'll see to that  --  She wo n't blame you  --  but I 'll surprise her  --  I 'll tell your family about her  --  " Come to Paris with us "  --  I 'll tell father , too  --  I know some things about her  --  And you wo n't get any divorce  --  not as long as I live  --  to throw me aside like an old rag  --  you drunken beast !  --  to go and live with some low woman of the streets  --  That 's it  --  I 'm not low enough for you  --  You do n't know what a good woman is  --  And she  --  I 've been a fool  --  I 've always defended her  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thanks I get  --  asking you to abandon your wife ! But I believe their stories now  --  I know what she is  --  She 's a bad woman  --  She lived with Carter before  --  Oooohh ! JOHN ( his face livid with rage , springs at her and clutches her by the throat ) You devil of a woman ! ( Maud pulls at his arms with her hands , her scream strangled into a shrill wheeze . John realizes what he is doing and pushes her from him . She falls to the floor and lies there sobbing convulsively . John looks around him wildly as if he were seeking some place of escape . ) By God , there 's an end to everything ! ( He rushes out of the door to hall and can be heard running up the stairs . Then for an instant a great silence broods over the house . It is broken by the muffled report of a revolver sounding from the floor above . Some thing falls heavily in the room overhead . Maud springs to her feet and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look of horrified comprehension passes over her face and , shrieking with terror , she rushes to the hall , and a moment later can be seen running past the front windows , her hair dishevelled , her hands pressed over her ears . Her screams grow gradually fainter. )
