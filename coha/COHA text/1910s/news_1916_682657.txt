Seventh PReglinetit ; ' , - " and Colonel Willard C. today gave out the text of a letter received by one of the men in this regiment from the Lackawanna Railroad . It was signed by G. E. Iduatia , General Auditor . " Please note carefully the attached copy of Bulletin No. 20 of the War Department , providing for the discharge of the men of the National Guard who have one or more dependents , " the letter said . " In view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advised by the President ( of the railroad company ) that the arrangement of this company to carry those employes at full or part compensation will be discontinued after a reasonable time has been allowed for the employes affected by this order to obtain their releases and to return to the service of the company . " You are requested immediately to make application for release according to the requirements set forth in War Department Bulletin No. 20 . If you elect to waive the provisions of this order and to remain in the service of the Government , this company 's arrangements for compensation in your case will be discontinued on Sept. 1 , Please acknowledge receipt and advise of the action you have taken . " A similar letter was received by employes of the Mutual Life Insurance Company , and a circular presaging like action by a trust company was exhibited by men in the Seventh Regiment . Many other letters of like context have been received by men in other regiments . Colonel Fisk has written to the employers who assert they are about to cease paying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said he thought the men . in the division were not here for their welfare only , but for that of the country and of their employers as well , and since the national exigency that required their presence along the border had not yet passed , the soldiers still had their obligations to the Government to discharge . That the country is not at war makes little difference in the effect of the promises given by the corporations , Colonel Fisk thinks . He and his son , Captain Clinton R. Fisk of Company D , ' eventh Regiment , gave up their law practice and closed their office in order to fulfill their military obligations . Many more applications for discharges have been sent in because it is not possible for a militiaman to pay more than his own expenses with the pay of a private soldier . Even the arrival of the Federal Paymaster , who gave out to individuals as small sums as 50 cents , nor the prospects of a State payday , have lessened the numbers of applications for discharges under the provision allowing men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who brought a squad of clerks to the border to make corrections in the- payrolls ; so that soldiers might not have to wait two weeks longer for their money , said today he would begin paying the men tomorrow . The Second Field Artillery and the Signal Corps are to be the first units to receive their money . " Wiretapping " Case at Camp . Although it was thought at first that all payments would be made by check , General Stotesbury has now decided to make all payments in cash , following the regular army custom , and $25,000 in currency is in the vaults of a local bank , ready for withdrawal . General Stotesbury also has arranged with the bank to issue drafts or checks to all soldiers free of charge , so that money may be easily forwarded to dependents . So many errors and discrepancies were found in , the rolls as made out by company commanders that if the money had once been paid out it would have been necessary to have spent months In rectifying the mistakes ; Since the Federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same rolls it is believed many mistakes have been made already , . While special guards have been detailed to see that no Mexican or other outlaw bands get the State pay before it is given to the men , the military police force has been making an inveqigaion of a " wiretapping - case of the border 's very own . Private R. - of Battery D , Second Field Artillery , is the military policeman who started the " wiretapping " investigation . He was on postoin the Mexican section of the village late last night when he. , heard - the ticking of ' a telegraph : sounder-4n , an-adobe , hut , and heard in Spanish arid ' rectly over the hut , and the guardsman thought he saw a " tap " wire leading through the thatched roof . He called military police headquarters and Sergeant Albert Bagley , Company C , Seventy-first Regiment , and Corporal R. G. Monroe . Company K. Seventh Regiment , were sent out to aid in the Investigation . When C. J. Ferris , Company A , Second Field Artillery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , arrived from their posts a guard was set around the house and Lieutenant E. C. 0 . Thomas , head of the Military Police , telephoned to division headquarters for aid . Colonel H. Bandholtz , Chief of Staff , and Major Edward Olmstead . Assistant Chief of Staff , were tent out at once by General O'Ryan to make an investigation . They found a Mexican I boy teaching a young American boy the Spanish language with the aid of a graphophone contrivance . Despite this error , Colonel Bandholtz commended Lieutenant Thomas and Policemen Bagley , Monroe , and for their work . General Parker Reviews Brigade . The Second Brigade , comprising the Seventh , the Seventy-first , and . the Twelfth Regiments , was today turned out in review in honor of Brig . Gen. . JamesParker , the guest of Brig . Gen. George R. Dyer , in command of the infantry at . Brig .. Gene . James W.

" Plans for the projected infantry hikes of the regiments in all three brigades have been changed again because of the shortage of water along the 110-mile route . If General Stotesbury is able to Pal ' the men before they leave , the first three regiments will leave on Wednesday or Thursday . The second series of three will then wait six days before proceeding , and will , therefore , not leave camp before Aug. ' 22 or 2:I . Then the others will not leave before Aug. 27 or 2s . General O'Ryan accompanied General Parker to Llano Grande , near Mercedes . today , where a. review of the division of Minnesota , Iowa , Nebraska , and Kansas troops was held In honor of the commander of the New York Division . President Truesdale Explains Action . William H. Truesdale , President of the Lackawanna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the railroad 's notification to its employes with the regiments along the border resulted simply from the War Department 's bulletin regarding volunteer soldiers with dependents . " The Lackawanna , like several other corporations , " said he , " has asked its men who are affected by the War Department 's ruling to return to their work in a reasonable time . Those on full pay have been notified that their wages will be discontinued on Sept. 1 if they have not made efforts to withdraw from their regiments . The rumor that their jobs will not be open to them if they are not back by that date is not true . " Mr. Truesdale said that the Mutual Life Insurance Company was another concern which had sent similarnotifications to its employes with dependent families . He is Vice President of the Mutual Life . At the Empire Trust Company . emphatic denial was made that its employes along the border would have their salaries cut off Sept. 1 if they were not back at work then . It was said the company stood by the resolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which provided that employes in National Guard regiments should have an indefinite leave of absene7. with full pay while in the service of the Government .
