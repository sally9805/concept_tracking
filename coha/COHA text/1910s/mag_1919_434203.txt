THE RUSSIAN These sayings on war and peace were set down by Madame Fedorchenk.o , a Russian nurse , from talks which she overheard among Russian soldiers at the front in 1915 , 1916 , and 1917 . From a large amount of material they are selected , translated , and arranged . These detached utterances of wounded soldiers , many of whom could neither read nor write , lying in their cots , were spoken without premeditation or thought of the nurse 's presence . Beyond translation , they are printed absolutely without change . Foreshadowing the inevitableness of events , they seem to penetrate the mystery of Russian character .  - -  TuomAs WHITTEMORE . WAR , war ! To some expected , unexpected to others . Many a man is unready , unprepared , body and soul . The crude gray forces were driven forth , to be the laughing-stock of the nations , with nothing made clear to them ; on the principle evidently that , having lived miserably so far , they might as well die for no reason they knew . Straw was good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By the wish of Wilhelm , by the order of Antichrist , war has been let loose over the world . War has eaten the corn in the land , and war has cut down nations by their roots . From the beginning of time there has been nothing like it . War is more dreadful than thunder , it is sharper than lightning , and is not more merciful than the wrath of God . A cloud has gathered amid the clear day ; war has come amid the Russian people . The women weep , and the girls , and the little children ; the old men brood and swear . At first , when they took us , seven- teen of us , from our village , we knew nothing , only just felt bad . At every station we raised a row and swore at the girls , and we sang all the way ; but we were homesick all the same . Then they began to drill us , and to some purpose , inasmuch as we even fell off in flesh . And they treated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fools . Yet we were by no means fools . We all were used to farm-work , every mother 's son of us . I worked under my father , and he was very strict . The only free time I had was when I worked at a factory for four months . On my way here I cried right along ; I felt I was taking leave of life . Mother has been dead these fifteen years , yet I kept moaning , ' Mother , mother ! ' as I cried . Our mother sent for us all . I came from the factory , and these were her words : ' Live , my son , long ; but live so that your life may not seem long to anyone else . ' I used to attend to a garden . My father was a gardener , and my grandfather also . They were good gardeners . My grandfather learned gardening abroad , and my mother was a gardener 's daughter . That is why I am such a soft fellow . From our earliest age we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the war we live only with worms and beetles . They dug me up by the roots from my garden , like an old pear tree . What sort of a soldier am I ? I was taken to the war as a chauffeur . I had always , from a child , had a knack for machinery , and in Belgium I learned all about motors . I drove my man right up to the Germans . By the side of us rode cavalry in helmets ; they charged , hewing right and left . And Gregory , ? before the Lord , I am not lying , ? after wounding a man , seized him by the collar , threw him down under his feet , and kicked him and stamped on him , till he gave up the ghost . I met Gregory after that , and I shamed him . ' You a democrat ? No , but a vile hound , that 's what you are ! Is that what you were taught in Belgium ? A German is a man all the same , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He wanted to fight me , he was so ashamed of himself . I had but a brief spell of good living . Mostly I lived miserably . And now I have risen . I have become an important man . And I laugh at everything . I stopped believing in God while I was still a shepherd boy . I said , ' I do not believe ; strike me ! ' There was a great thunderstorm ; but He did not strike me . I never particularly cared for life , and did not particularly thank papa and mamma for the gift . But now that they need us for the war , they call us ' brothers , ' and ' boys , ' and ' dear children . ' Whose is the blame ? Who can be reproached with the sin ? If we only knew that , if we knew ! Is it the Germans , is it the Pagans , is it the Austrians , or the Bulgarians ? One 's soul has been sold , and no man is guilty of the war . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war itself will finish itself . I am learning everything afresh . The Lord , the Son of God , said , ' Do not kill . ' That means , Kill , without mercy ! ' Love your neighbor as yourself , ' means , Take his last crust ; and if he will not give it quietly , hit him with an axe . It was said , ' Do not defile your mouth with unclean words ' ; but here , Sing vile songs about your mother , to make it merrier for your souls ! In a word , grow wolves ' teeth for yourselves , and if it is too late and they wo n't grow , here is a bayonet for you , and cannon , to bite your neighbor under his ribs . But to make a real soldier of me , my back must yet be flogged with whips . I hate the enemy so , I dream of him at night . I dream I ant lying on top of a German , a sturdy fellow , and he wo n't get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes hold of my hand . I can not overcome him . I stick my fin-gem in his eyes , trying to make a hole right through to his brain . At last I find the way ! And I am so glad , my very blood boils with joy . Here you kill a man and get praised for it . Only you do n't draw any pleasure from that . What can be worse than taking life ? And if you do , you know that you do a forbidden thing . You feel much better if your conscience torments you . If you pay the whole price for your sin , it is gone . In times of war miracles happen even to the like of us . How that is , I do n't know . My feet gave out ; I lagged behind and lay down for a brief rest in a ditch . I thought , ' They must pass here , not far off , and I 'll catch up with them . ' There I lay , and heard them marching , marching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was powerless to move . I heard them tramping , tramping , noticing but infantry ; their boots stamped regularly in time . I thought , ' Lord ! here are not so many of us around here . Suppose they are Germans ! ' I raised my head a bit and looked . So far as I could see , the place was full of the dead . They were disposed in companies , in white winding-sheets . I could hear the tramp , but these seemed to lie flat , like a mist . I lay still as death . We heard groans , entreaties , questions . We dared not answer ; it is forbidden ; besides , we did not understand . Woods were all about , and we could not see . But when the moon mounted up , like a rolling ball , we saw ; we were surrounded with wounded and cripples , who crept up to us , begging for help . But we could not take them on our horses . The priest called me to him , and said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You are more intelligent than the rest , so you have more to answer for . ' Had I but known what was coming ! We were going there with no thought of blood . Indeed , I kept telling the boys to be careful not to kill the man . But we could not possibly let the scoundrel go scot-free . But when we got there , we began beating him ; while he shrieked , we beat him to silence him , and when he stopped shrieking , we just went on . And so it was we killed him , while we never intended to ! He approached me ; but instead of looking for my wound , he began to fumble about my pockets . I felt deadly faint , but anger revived me , and I tried to shriek . He squeezed my throat . I succeeded in throwing him to one side . Swine that you are , ' I shouted , ' dress my wound ! I do n't need your help to find my purse . ' I took aim at him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would turn out to be a German . I aimed from a branch . I took long aim , and shot very luckily . He fell flat , and turned out to be a German , and healthy as a bull . I tied his hands , and when we came to the little wood , I tethered his legs like a goat 's . I said , ' Sit down , we will rest . ' He sat , and I at once stuck a cigarette between his teeth . He grinned , but looked very blue . I asked , Are you an officer ? ' He nodded . I asked , ' Are you a soldier ? ' He nodded . I could not make it out . I smoked and considered how to make him appear as important as possible , when I brought him in , so that I might get a reward . I finished smoking . ' Get up , ' said I , ' and come along . ' He was silent . I repeated it sternly , but he remained still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cigarette between his teeth had gone out . I touched him and found he was dead . Whether I lay long , I do not know . There were stars . One had to move , and I crept up the bill . On the other side of the hill I knew were the Germans . The rockets were all to the left , and I was glad of that . As I crept on , I heard their talk . I looked , but there was nothing to be seen , only , close at hand a fire blazed up . A sturdy German had lit a primua , and was boiling coffee ? and the scent of it ! ' 0 Lord I ' I thought , ' if one only had that , how good it would be ! ' My mouth was full of saliva . I crept on ; he sat waiting for his coffee and looking at the fire . I fell on him from behind , to strangle him quickly . He died silently , evidently from fright . I took the coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I drank it up , and carried off the coffeepot and his helmet . I unbuttoned his uniform and found the portrait of a young lady : here it is . I do n't carry it about merely because she 's handsome , but I feel sorry for her , the poor orphan . He used to warm her with his heart ; and now I 'm sorry for her . We do n't have to answer for anything . Whether the Germans win or whether we win , no one has to answer for it . But among the Germans , it is said , everyone is held responsible , and has to know what he does . Are they taught as we are taught , ra-ta-ta , and ta-ra-ra ? No ! They are shown how their enemies live , and what their customs are . And when they return after a fight , they are questioned as to what they have done . Each one carries out what is ordered . The Germans will teach us many things , but while they are teaching they will torture us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay down to sleep , I used to fold my hands in a cross on my breast , in case anything appeared to me in my sleep . But now I fear neither God nor the devil . After I had stuck a bayonet into a man 's stomach , it was as if something had fallen away from me . When the Lord started the Sun on its course in the sky , laughter blossomed among men . They'say the Sun is to die some clay , and it is true that things point that way . Even since I was born , I can see that men laugh less than they used to . Father , father ! I ask you to teach me , for Christ 's sake . I am afraid , I fear death . If I come to Paradise they will ask what good I have done ; and what have I done ? Nothing . If worked , my heart burst with anger , and when I rested , I slept without stirring . There is no sin in that , that I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sees it all . it means that it depends on his will to permit it or not to permit it . If my little one goes near the fire , I 'll drag him away and spank him ; or if I see his intention in time , I will not permit it . Now God sees everything . If anything had happens , that too is his will . There is no sin in God . Whatever one may say to him , he hits you in the face . For a ' Just so ! ' he 'll knock your teeth loose . Well , could not stand it , but one might not complain . Complaints are not accepted against messieurs the officers . And what sort of a monsieur was he ? He had been serving as a clerk in the office , and doing everything for himself . And now he has climbed to be a man ! No colonel or general would knock one about so . I could not endure it . Was I a boy , to be so beaten ? I went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sent to prison , and again beaten ; and when I returned , I was ridiculed . Life was very hard for me . But here I forgive everything . We are all suffering together . Take the officers , now , the command ; of course they are not always kind to us . Still , they do no little good . They teach you at the very beginning , not merely to handle your rifle , but if need be , to read and write ; and that will be of the greatest use to us after the war . And who sees that we are clothed , and shod , and fed ? To take away our command would be the same as taking a door from its hinges . We should be running out into every kind of weather . So better keep still . He received a letter , and shut himself up for some three hours . Then he called me . ' Ivan , ' said he , tidy up the hut . ' But it had already been tidied up that morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved things from one.place to another . Having turned about long enough , I went out . A bit later he called again . He was sitting with the letter in his hand and seemed strange . ' Ivan , tidy up the hut ! ' said he . Again I turned things about , and went out . A bit later he again called me , for the same thing . What , thought I , can have so upset him ? When I had left the hut , he shot himself . The two of us , Semion and I , carried our sheep by turns . It was alive , but did not hinder us much . Still , we got so tired , we sat down to rest , and before we knew it , fell asleep . Through my sleep , I heard Semion softly calling me , and saying the Germans were quite near . Sleep fell from me as if it had never been . I sat up , staring into the dark night like an owl , and seeing nothing . Neither could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from fright . When I had recovered my breath a little , I did hear : true , it was the Germans ! And from the time I left home I was afraid of nothing so much as being taken prisoner . Our sheep somehow rid itself of its bonds and plunged into the thicket , making a considerable noise , which fear magnified into thunder . Who else would think of an animal at such a critical moment ? Yet in Semion jumped up , and rushed after the sheep ; and that was the last of him . The Germans were after him in no time ; they fired ; then I could hear that they were getting farther and farther away . So I ran in the opposite direction , and toward morning I found our men . But no news of Semion . And he has a family at home . And all for a sheep ! Oh , yes , it hurts when you get wounded ! But you get over it , and live on . You eat and drink and talk to people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poison gases ! To pay for those , many , many Germans should be killed . Nothing could be worse than gas . It twists you and tortures the soul out of you . You wo n't ever be glad again , not for one little hour . I can not say it was very terrible . When I was wounded , I forgot all the world ; there I lay and shrieked , and felt no shame . And I can not say that it hurt so very much ; but the thought came to me that I was now alone in the whole world , and so I might do anything . And so I lay and shrieked , then called for ' Mother ! ' That 's all . Then they picked me up . The wound proved of no importance . My leg was all covered with boils and burned like fire . He said , ' He 's pretending . ' ' Think of that , whets wanted to die , I suffered so ! How could I work at digging trenches ? The clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it felt like hell-fire , so intense was the torment . Oh , what a terrible time we had ! When the first wagon arrived , Semion Ivanovit ch alighted from it and said to his wife , ' Get the children ready , and get together our really necessary things ; we are ordered out of here . ' The woman sank down weeping and wailing at the top of her voice . A crowd assembled in an instant ; it was as if a thunderbolt had struck the village , and all were crying . Some were striking their heads against the ground , others tearing at their hair . One old woman fetched out a young heifer , put her arms around her neck , and howled ; and so did all the dogs , for company . Well , they had to be loaded into the wagons by force , as they could not be persuaded . Most of them barefoot ? rain , mud , cold , a terrible , terrible time at its very worst . How many ruined children I have seen here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her out of my mind . Think of it ! In a single hour soldierdom made a wreck of her life . Her mot her was beaten to death , her father hanged , and her sister outraged and tortured to death . She was left ? not more than eight years old ! ? with a baby brother who had not been weaned . I began to give him bread as gently as I could , and I rind to stroke his head ; but he squealed like a wild animal , and with that cry set off to run over anything that lay in his way . After one 's eye had lost sight of him , one could long hear how he cried like a beast from grief and loneliness . Wheat , every ear of it , praises God . It is the trumpet of the Archangels . But amid the corn dead soldiers are lying , ours and theirs . The corpses are fresh , and do not yet cause a smell ; the field smells more . And among the corpses , children are wandering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away took a baby on her arm and a little one by the hand . The little one broke loose and was lost amid the corn . They were mostly two-year and three-year children . The people here have handsome kiddies , but they are so frightened that they have long forgotten how to cry ; they seem to have lost their voices . They seem stupefied , and dirt and tears have dried on their faces . And some are bloodstained ; perhaps they have been beaten . Our Sisters of Mercy began to wash and feed them . They were as silent as dolls . Only when they had gone some ten versts did they recollect themselves and begin to howl . War is hard on the children . In the wood stood a cross , someone 's grave . I sat down there and did not feel uneasy . At midnight clouds collected under the firs , and the fog crept coldly over me , and sadness seized my heart . I remembered all my griefs . Evidently he must have died suddenly , to be buried in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he must have suffered much , for now that he 's dead , he sows sorrow all around him . In that wood we used the pots that had held the water brought to wash the dead with . Lots of berries and mushrooms grew in that wood , but no one cared to gather them . People said that beasts and birds used to go there to die . It was an uncanny place . In times of drought mists would rise above it , like curling smoke , and a breath of corruption came from it . At night people were afraid even to walk past it . Voices were heard there , and those who heard them did not live long . That ? a church ? More like an old chicken-house ! It makes me laugh . For I have been , from a child , a diligent churchgoer . Now , their houses are like palaces , with clean beds , wardrobes , and cupboards , sofas , crockery , roses in the front yard , cut and trimmed as if by the barber 's hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not so with us . Cockroaches , dirt , a heavy smell that sticks in your nose , that 's our izba . We sleep in it until the birds wake up ; then we eat our fill of bread , and are off to the fields . But we are zealous in worship , and build nice houses for God . About Masha , a great grief has befallen me . By ill luck I went home . I wrote to say that I was coming , but they did not get the letter . Thirty versts I went by rail , then hired a horse and arrived in the evening . The window was lit up and I looked in . Masha was seated , and beside her some stran- ger who had put his hand on her breast , and was sitting quietly so . My soul felt like bursting . I wished to break in , but reason restrained me . I knocked at the window . She rose so quietly that it was evident everybody knew about it , and that this kind of thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window , shaded herself with her hand from the lamp , saw me , and trembled . And I was so glad at their fright that I shook all over . She went back and looked at the man . She told him , and he prepared to run away ; but I struck her a mortal blow , and in the morning I drove away to the town , and spent all my money with girls there . I still had ten days left after the journey , and from the first moment sadness seized me , to think I should so soon have to go back . I did n't have a single hour 's happiness . I was afraid to let my heart thaw ; I was expecting great grief ahead of me . I sha n't again accept leave . God take it ! I no longer want to go home , I saw such things there . I will buy some land here , and will behave well to the inhabitants , so that the blood spilt may be forgotten . More than a little of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is fertile with blood , and it will yield good crops . People will soon forget the war . I was not to blame . The ice on our river had broken up with the spring . The ice crashed like thunder . Our river is a deep one ; steamships go in it . So the river with the ice moved in the early morning , and I had gone to a bath in the suburb , and was returning , being weak after serving in the regiment . I heard a cry ; I looked up and saw two boys leaping from one block of ice to another , and the ice was twisting about like shavings in the fire . ' Uncle , help us ! Uncle , help us ! ' But how was I to help if I did not wish to lose my own life ? I did not help . Then folk collected , shouted , and screamed ; and the boys were drowned . I took one swallow of it . It burned , it grew dark before my eyes ; a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood . I had to laugh against my will , just like a little child , and I forgot all my troubles . That 's how I began to drink . I should like to drink a barrel of vodka . That was what I always had to be at when I was unhappy . And now , as one 's life is that of the beasts , it would be better to be like a beast in all . We loved our mother , and did n't wish to cause her any grief . Our father was a drunkard and used to beat her till she was red all over . I used to pray God to let me grow up quicker . ' Wait a bit , ' I used to think . ' By and by you will learn what it means to drag mother about by her hair ! ' But when I grew up , I took to drink . At first my father and mother used to beat me , but I grew stronger and beat my father , and ( sin though it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fine defender for you ! A woman should be kind and respectful , not envying another woman for her husband , a careful mother of her children , an orderly housewife , zealous toward God , and faithful to her home . Oh , you woman-spindle , twisted by toil ! While the peasant labors in the field and works till he gets a bent back , let the wife enter the but like a sun , sweep up the rubbish , bake the bread , and teach the children sense and knowledge ! I feel queer here sometimes at night before I fall asleep , if I am tired . I seem to be not myself , and I try to think of some word , some gentle tender word , such as ' blossom ' or ' dawn , ' or something like that , something sweet and pleasant . Then I will sit on my cot , and keep repeating that word to myself , ten times or more . And then it seems as if a kind hand caresses me , and so I go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lying close up to their defenses , and for four days had not been able to climb out ; we lay like reptiles . There was not a dry spot ; one could not get accustomed to it . And H , the ensign , had been caught on the wire when we had started to attack . At first he asked for help , called on the men by name ; but one could not show one 's nose without being shot . Then he only groaned and breathed heavily . That went on for four days , and he still lived . It is a sin to grumble at God , but here one says , ' Why be careful of one 's life if one can not spare one 's soul ? ' I could n't endure it , and took him off the wire ; but I got wounded . Then there was an attack , and our men captured the post . I am very handsome myself . Women swarm about me like bees round a flower , and I 'm not one to refuse them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For what is it like ? ? just like dogs or cows . Perhaps it will yet come about ; I am not yet twenty-three . Beauty must be good for something , or else it 's only like sugar in tea . And then the staff sent some Jews to us . It was a joke . One roared like a whale , and another , as soon as he came , lay down as if dead . He was pale , but his ears wagged . Another , more forward , was always creeping up to the officers and whispering . But there , whisper or no whisper , we must all keep together . We sat in the trenches all night , and when we got there we entered a house with Stepa Kovalev , and saw a lot of goods of all kinds . We did not know what they were all for . All sorts of articles ! Our enemies do live well ! We spread a blanket and began to put things into it . What was for each of us we could settle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sin . All the same , if we did not take it , others would ? there was no owner . There is nothing worse than to abandon a house , but it was not pleasant to stay there , either , especially not for a woman . 0 Lord , when one sees a woman , one neighs like a stallion . Then , weep or not , one had to act . As we were wrapping the things in the blanket our Jew appeared . ' Lads , ' he said , ' that wo n't do . ' We were silent . He went on jawing and we held our tongues . He became excited and shouted , and the captain came . He was amused , but could not help himself , and had to forbid it . He laughed , but ordered us to give up the things . Well , the Jew got it hot from us and from the captain . He went off to the hospital . Here I am homesick for birds . I remember my boyhood , not only for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the delight I had in birds . If Dad , as sometimes happened , would not let me into the house , I used to sleep all night somewhere in a hollow among the vegetable gardens . There were elder-shrubs all around , and the birds ' berries . Before the sun rose , the birds would be tuning up in the bushes , trying their voices . In the early morning how their voices feel the sun ! So full of joy are those voices , the sun could not but appear in answer to that resounding call , could not but appear . I was allowed to go out . I went to see the animals and the birds . What beauty unspeakable there is in the world ! Some birds are clothed in feath- ers of every hue in the rainbow , and have eyes like precious stones . And such animals ! Incredible ! There is the lion , now , the king of beasts . The crowd stands around him , gazing with idle curiosity . But he lies quiet and wo n't stir , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there at all . He is seeing something of his own , quite different . You feel the strength under that hide , a strength like cast steel ; and his very calm is terrible . Believe it or not , as you will , but the earth breathes . Only your ear is not always attuned to hear it . Life makes too great a noise around you ; we never have leisure , either to look or to listen closely . But there are peculiar days and nights , when the soul tears itself from the material and sees and hears earth live , as you might say , her own separate life . She stirs the swaying grasses and the waters ; breathes in vapors , in mists , in the fragrance of flowers , in the exhalations of all living things . So immense is 1 he life of the earth that man can sense it only by feeling , not from knowledge . I t hink monastic life is the real thing , the stillness that could make many things clear ; but where find such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you , perhaps a letter from home , saying that all are well , and send their love . And forthwith your soul weakens , and you begin to have all sorts of things the matter with you , and the sum of your sins increases . No ! a man should have a stiff soul , tight-laced , trained to think of only one thing ; then would there be no room for sin . Do not pine , lad ; what 's the use ? So very little will be wasted out of life , the merest trifle . You 're so very young . The war is making havoc of the whole world . One soul is like one pea in a bag , which , without being shaken , finds its way to the bottom . The main thing is ? preserve life . One thing a soldier regrets , which is that he has a head on his shoulders . Ah , if he had only arms and legs , he would fight without sorrow , and gain glory for his Tsar . A blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it , and grasped it in his hand . The fiery bloom burned his hand , but he did not open it . His heart sank within him , for there were voices and a great noise in the wood ; sometimes that , and then again such an unearthly dead silence , as deafens the ear not less than noise . He closed his eyes tight , and through his eyelids Ile saw devils of various shapes and sizes , who all rushed up to him , but could not strike him . He walked through fire and through water , and through deadly thickets , through this incomprehensible devilish mirage . The live fire blazed in his hand , burning him to the heart , but uttering promises . ' Carry me , lucky one ! for the great good fortune I bring . Think of something ; give me some order ; I will get and bring anything wished for . Let not devilish temptations lure thee . Do not destroy thy soul , nor anybody 's soul . This bloom has power in the night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all good things shall be thine , and joy , love , and heart 's ease . ' Thick and ancient woods ; one can not see through them , one can not pass through them ; one can only sing about them in ancient songs . Such woods stand with no path in them . There is such strength in the earth as can overgrow man 's roads with wild grasses , and bury them beneath fallen branches , and drive swift currents over them . In the wood there is a different life , not for men 's eye . And the devil is there . One says to another , ' He is no sort of man if he has not read Pushkin and those other writers . ' Just think what the fellow who says that imagines ! Why , none of us have read them ; and are we really not men ? He 's read them , and yet there 's no sense in him ! He 's weak in body and weak in character , he 's easily frightened , he 's cross with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man but a skunk , and that 's all your Pushkin ' s worth . But among us there are real heroes . I ca n't forget that one , he insulted us so . He mimicked very well and seemed cleverer than the other simple folk , but when it came to business he was no good . He could tell anything and invent anything , and put songs and tales together well , but he lived only on someone else 's hump . Such a fellow could perhaps have found a place in a town ; there people loaf the whole day ; but the village keeps hold of your hand . If you have n't a hand , you ca n't feed yourself . What 's the use of talking ? As if the like of us were ever asked to talk ! At home I was a good scholar . I used to go to the teacher 's every day for a separate lesson . He liked me for my cleverness ; and indeed I was apt in all things , If I heard a poem but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I remembered it . I figured out problems in my mind . I could mend a watch or clock as quick as I could look at it . I could understand anything . So I understood that this was not the kind of people that were wanted for the war . And now I am in the infantry ; here I sit , like a dog leashed for hunting , and see and know nothing . Never had I seen such a jasmine . It was not a shrub but a tree . The smell held one 's soul . In such a thicket of jasmine were we posted . We lay down : one could hardly breathe , so strong was the scent of the jasmine . In my head , an old-wife 's fairy tale seemed to be repeating itself . There were no real thoughts , nor weariness nor fear ; onl : ? the fairy-tale . But before long the tale ended . The thing fell right among the jasmines , and I ceased to dream , just as Stepnyack , with an oath , began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I had lost an eye at the very same moment . Let the smart old wife tell his , stories . I remained there ; had they forgotten me ? I was on guard . I lived there a clay , and ate dry rusks . The second da ? there were no rusks left . On the third clay I was so hungry I went to search for some mushrooms and found them . I boiled water in a tin and swallowed it with the mushrooms , but threw it all up . What was to be done ? No one came for me . By the evening I was ready to die ; my stomach ached and twisted , and I was sick . I had an attack of cholera . Then they fetched me to the barracks . Such was my fate . Inventions , say I , fibs ! All that stuff about the soul . The soul is a good thing in the body . And the body is good when in constant activity . Therefore , work , look around you , attend to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soul ! and at the same time live like swine . Go , go , do not wait ! Go to beg in the village . Seeking the Lord goes a strange man with a little lad , ? a gray one with a white one , ? blind and bold , beyond our sight onward to the blue sea , to the edge of the earth . With labor to Paradise , for the maimed and the sinners ? out of the thick darkness . Go wanderer , over the earth , winter and summer . THE RUSSIAN I have got a little property by the war . I did not rob ; and what money I have received was given me by a Jewish woman . I took their part . I was looking on when our country-folk , with whips , were making an old Jew gallop over a hedge . He was a hundred-yearold Jew , with curls , dry , with white socks on his legs , and with hair yellow-gray . I went up to them . ' Do n't you fear God ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They let him go , and the Jewess thanked me and gave me money . I took it . Ten krones ! I think I shall have time to run there . I do so want that shirt ; it is a nice one , and I want to see the woman , the laundress . A fine woman , she has given me no offense . And an Austrian ca me to meet me ? I from one end of the village and he from the other . And the woman 's but was at the Austrian 's end . I rushed into the but and seized the clothes on the shelves , just what there was ; then seized the woman and made for the door and ran . But they shouted and fired . Not one of them hit me ! And I had got four pairs of trousers and a warm shirt . I now have a dowry , ready for my wedding . I went to the window ; tap , tap ! A woman opened it , a timid woman , who trembled and did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall hung a cupboard from which she took bread and cheese , and she began warming some vodka on a primes.I ate , but there was a noise in my ears . I thought no power could tempt me from this spot . Again came a tap , tap ! at the window . The woman opened as she had done for me . Hooked up and saw an Austrian tumble into the hut . We looked at one another . A piece of bread stuck in my throat till I was ready to vomit . What we were to do , we did not know . He sat down and took some bread and cheese . He gobbled it and tucked away at it no worse than I had done . The woman served the vodka hot , two cups of it . And we began to drink just as if we were chums . We drank and ate , and lay down on the bench , head to head . In the morning we parted . There was no one to give us any orders . Should I inform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to , his speeches were so very much against all law . It was not alone that he abused the command ? Ise went for the Tsar himself . Had I informed , it had been good for me ; our company commander would have had to give me a bill of three roubles , and those lower down would have respected me . And you know it is those lower down who are nearest to us . Yet I held my tongue . I did not take any leaflets , as that would have been against my oath of allegiance ; but I listened , and that was sin enough . But he was such a fascinating speaker . If you ask me why I did not inform , I could not tell you . But the fact remains I did not . He would bewitch you . We are only too well prepared . Wronged in every way , humbled , living worse than animals , waiting ail the time for somebody to teach us ; so we listen . We do not follow him ? we are afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God forbid ! As soon as it was dark , we went . They helped us down into their trench . What a trench ! More like a palace . And do n't the dogs live in clover ! Coffee and rum the first thing . They chattered away , but every other word was Kamerad , ICamerad . ' Their officer distributed leaflets , very politely . We took them ? why not ? Most of us could not read , so no harm was done ; and why should we be rude ? So we ate and drank and talked , and now it was time to go home . Half an hour later we were firing at each other . Comradeship is one thing , service is another . Do you think one has to be a special kind of man to kill another man ? It does not take much effort to do that . You come home , you find want every where ? the children half-starved , the wife dried to a stick , and blaming you and nagging at you for it all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then a thief comes by night and tries to steal your only remaining wretched horse . Well , when you catch him , all you think of is to put the evil thing out of the way . And so you kill him . There is no kind feeling in my soul for those who have remained at home . When I read that things are going badly for them there , I ant glad . Let them , think I , eat one another up like reptiles for having sent us into torment . It is beyond human strength to destroy that monster ? War . There is no end or limit to it . So how could anybody be leisurely thinking in a leisurely way about domestic affairs or comfortable living ? Think of your soul . That is what everything depends on in the next world . As to this world , our life in it can hold neither light nor joy .
