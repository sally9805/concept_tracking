txt PACIFISM IN THE PULPIT . Criticism of Dr. Speer 's Address by Religious Workers . As a friend of the Y. M. C. A. , and , we trust , a loyal American , let wits thank you for your interest and space given to the Y. M. C. A. addresses at Columbia University . Since the feeling comes by times that the enemy in our midst is receiving rather too lenient treatment , it Is refreshing that there ? are those who demand of our supposedly loyal , trod Americans a high stand on our great task . The attitude of Dr. Speer comes with a decided shock to one who , as a student , was wont to hear his inspiring addresses on missionary and other occasions of interest to students . Not being personally acquainted with Professor Mitchell , and being at a Distance , the feeling was that surely lir . Speer could be given the advantage of any misunderstanding , if such there were proved to be . But the letter from Dr , Speer himself seems to leave no doubt but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their letters and public interest . Granted that it is true that " we have to replace an order of selfishness and wrong and division with an order of brotherhood and righteousness and unity , " is not the very best way to do this to strengthen the hands and hearts of our people in this great task ? Is it the time to sit in one 's study and prepare criticisms of society when one 's house Is on fire ? I may be wrong , but this letter gives me the impression that Dr. Speer Is forced by certain reasons to give assent to the necessity and righteousness of our war , but , having done this , immediately washes his hands of the whole affair and wishes to be undisturbed in his regular work . It is this semi-detachment which often hurts more than outward disapproval . It is this attitude on the part of many church leaders which has inspired the criticism that the church has run to cover during the storm and will emerge afterward unchanged by the mighty transformations which this war is working . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and none of our other problems will suffer while wo bend every energy to secure the right conclusion . Surely on this point there should be no wavering . Without meaning anything personal in this one word , it does seem that for any 0110 to assume that this war is just a passing cyclone and will leave the world much the same when it has passed is to assert the most deadly form of enervating pacifism . Moreover , is it not better wisdom and policy to see the world come through this war and not over it ? To think it Christian to live in a semi-detached atmosphere while men are laboring and dying for the very ideals of Jesus Christ seems to be a travesty upon the spirit and ideals of the Great Leader of men . W. WOOD , Chaplain Dartmouth College . Hanover , N. H. , Feb. 26 , 1918 , A Canadian View . Let me thank you , as a Canadian , British-born , and for many years a citizen of the United States , for your timely and friendly warning in TICK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Young Men 's Christian Association against preaching pacifism to college students or in any other way weakening the moral determination of all your people to fight hard and fight to the end in this terrible struggle . It Is certainly not too much to expect those who are shaping and directing the idealistic impulses of young men at the present time that they should so foster and shape them as to bring their full and fresh force to bear upon lite only task that , until it is well done , ought to be given much time or serious thought , To many of us who have seen what the war means in the life of Prance and England and are living now in the midst of maimed men and grief-stricken relatives , and so know a little of this price already paid in human suffering and death because of Germany 's devilish wrongdoing , it seems that our religion itself Is being tested by the measure of strength which It shows in functioning upon the war and in leading its professors ' to press the war with unquenchable zeal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not hope to keep the friendship and active co-operation of virile men , young or older , among students or elsewhere , by maudlin sentiment or by a iallure to discover and declare how deep the moral issues arc that are involved in the war . If this war Is lost the religion of Christ will be handicapped in its world conquest , and the only way for the Church and all of its agencies to insure its being won is to use its full power to induce all who regard its teaching to look upon the winning of the war as the great moral and religious duty of the hour . Not only must such organizations as the Young Men 's Christian Association not be harbors to shelter " slackers , " but they must , and I think will , prove great power-houses to stimulate and release enthusiastic mural and patriotic energy . G. A. WARBURTON , General Secretary Toronto Y. M. C. A. Toronto , Feb. 2.5. 1918 . The Second Meeting as Bad . Referring to the discussion of the student meetings held last week at Columbia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish to say that of the three evening meetings held , I attended the second only , and did not therefore hear Dr. Speer , but the criticism made by Professor Mitchell of Dr. Speer 's address might In substance have been justly made of the addresses at the second meeting . I do not attempt quotation , but the essence of the whole meeting was that we were just as bad as the Germans , and there was no syllable or word uttered more in favor of the United States than of Germany . Professor ' Mitchell 's interpretation of the spirit of these meetings have no doubt is not only a natural but a necessary one from the words used . As a. supporter of the Y. M. C. A. and one who has a high appreciation of the value of the practical service reNlered in the camps at home and abroad , I was certainly disappointed . Such a meeting as I attended is a direct interference with the war , and ought , fn my judgment , to be prohibited by Mc Govern . ment .
