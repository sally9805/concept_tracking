 | WILD animals have their individual idiosyncrasies , and no two of a kind are ever exactly alike in their behavior . Study four lions , tigers , bears , or elephants , and you will find that each animal has its own way of doing things , its own moods , its own peculiar temperament . Lions are , I think , peculiarly unlike one another in disposition . I have known sulky , morose lions who did not forget a real or fancied grievance ; and I have known hasty , passionate lions who flared up at the least provocation , often without any provocation at all , but whose anger died away as quickly as the flame from a match , and who afterward seemed to have no recollection of having had any grievance . Some lions are dull , slow , phlegmatic , and stupid , too lazy to be roused by any little unusual incident . As an illustration of individual traits in lions , I think the following case is an interesting one .  | Twin Lions of Opposite Disposition On September @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show at Columbia , Tennessee , gave birth to twin cubs , who were named , respectively , Schley and Dewey . The cubs were healthy and vigorous , and grew up to be strong , good specimens . The proprietor , from the time of their birth , made great pets of them both , and continually spoke of them as absolutely " tame . " He took me to their cage , one day , to prove to me how quiet and docile these lions were . In the romp that followed between the animals and the proprietor , Dewey , I thought , was occasionally a trifle rough . The proprietor went close to the bars of the cage , and the two full-grown lions put their huge paws through the bars , around his head and shoulders , and drew his face so close to the bars that only those who can really understand what a frightfully risky thing this was. , can imagine what my feelings were . The young lions played with his head as if it were a ball ; but , although the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the man had no fear . He explained that they would never hurt him : he had reared them from cubs . But , as I watched Dewey , it seemed to me that more than once his wild nature leaped out through his eyes and asserted itself in his quickened movements , and that , had the master been inside the cage , Dewey might have seriously injured him . But Schley was the most gentle , unemotional , and placid lion I have ever seen . Neither then nor later , under provoking circumstances , did I ever see him show any ill temper or surliness . When the helper was cleaning out his cage , one day , he let the long pole that he was using fall , hitting Schley ? who was asleep in a corner ? full on the nose , a very sensitive part . The man looked a trifle scared ; but Schley only opened his eves with a start , got up slowly , stretched himself , and then went over to the pole and sniffed it . After yawning heavily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in before , rested his head comfortably on his huge paws , and went to sleep again . This , in a lion , was remarkable conduct . But Schley has given even more remarkable evidences of his equanimity . When this show was at Johnstown , Pennsylvania , a street procession was given ; and at the head of the procession , on the front seat of the proprietor 's automobile , sat Schley , then a full-grown lion , with neither a chain nor a rope . He was perfectly free ; there was nothing to prevent his getting down if he had wanted to ; yet he rode in this manner , calm , dignified , and absolutely uninterested , through streets where more than fifty thousand people were assembled . Naturally , every precaution was taken . Two men , who sat behind him , never took their eyes off the lion , and they had orders , on the slightest sign of his growing restless or attempting to get down , to shoot him at once . Both carried pistols fully loaded . A Lion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proprietor gave a press dinner , at the end of the meal Schley was allowed to walk into the dining-room , which he did in his usual sedate and placid manner . He looked around , actually got on the table , sniffed the bottles and a cigar , and then quietly got down and walked out again . There were many clever men and brave ones at that dinner , but no man there was ashamed to admit afterward that he felt a little easier in his mind when the late arrival had left the room . It is generally acknowledged that a very quiet tiger ? one that does not growl or snarl ? is far more dangerous than one that is perpetually showing signs of ill temper . A snarling tiger gives warning ; a quiet one will steal up behind its keeper or trainer , flat on its stomach , and , should the trainer turn round , it will stop dead and appear to be looking off into the distance ! There is , for instance , ? or was a few years ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Zoological Gardens at Belle Vue , Manchester , England , who toward his keepers maintained a very quiet and docile demeanor . And yet , this was the great " Fighting Tiger , " who was never happy unless he was fighting , and who always appeared relieved and refreshed after he had had an opportunity of almost killing another of his species . Lopez , the Jaguar Jaguars are more noted for their deceit , craftiness , and treachery than all the other treacherous members of the cat tribe . Slyness , stealth , and cunning are written in the quick , keen glances from their wicked eyes , in their soft , lightning-like movements , and , above all , in their moments of deadly quiet . The most deceitful of all his deceitful kind is Lopez , the well-known jaguar in the New York Zoological Park , who has been living there now for eight years . A well-grown , finely developed animal , he is noted for his beauty of form and coloring , his grace of movement , and his villainous personality . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attendants watch his every  | movement with a careful eve . He fought wildly , furiously , and continually to get out of his cage , and his wicked face and eyes looked the evil and revenge that he had no means of perpetrating . But a rough sea voyage ? and Lopez had a particularly rough one ? will generally subdue , for a time , any wild animal , and by the time Lopez arrived at the park , in May , 1903 , he was very much quieter . When he got over his fright from the journey and recovered from the effects of seasickness , he appeared to feel well and content . His disposition seemed to have completely changed , and he gave every one who had anything to do with him the impression that he was a particularly amiable specimen of jaguar . He seemed like some big , genial , good-tempered cat , always ready to have a quiet little game with any one who cared to play with him . He would lie on his back , paw the air playfully , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out one of his soft , strong paws and invite a little skirmish . He was put for a time into one of the smaller houses , and was then transferred to the Lion House . He had the honor of being one of the very first residents there , for he was installed before the house was entirely finished . He drew himself sleekly and softly out of the little transfer-cage , and slipped into his clean , spacious new home , which he seemed to appreciate highly . To show his appreciation , he rolled luxuriously on his back with his four paws in the air , and turned from side to side , looking around him as if critically examining the cage , all the time purring loudly . " He certainly is a good-tempered one ! " one of the keepers remarked admiringly . Dr. Hornaday , the Director of the New York Zoological Park , equally impressed by his fineness as a specimen and by his evident happiness and contentment , decided to obtain a companion for Lopez , and after a while a fine young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought to New York to cheer Lopez 's solitude . Lopez is Pleased with His New Neighbor It is always considered advisable , before putting any strange animals together , to place them  | in close proximity for a time , until they become accustomed to each other and show their like or dislike . So the little new jaguar , in her cramped traveling-cage , was put close to the spacious apartment of Senor Lopez , and the keepers were much interested to see what he would do . He came to the front of his cage , rubbed himself against the bars , purred loudly , and did all that a jaguar could do to show the new arrival that he was pleased and interested in her . But those who study wild animals are generally very cautious , especially in a case of this kind ; and so , in spite of all these favorable indications , Dr. Hornaday decided to keep them apart , but in close proximity , for a few days more . The cage of the newcomer was raised to the level of Lopez @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever . He walked in his quick , stealthy way up and down the front of the cage , as if he wished to be as close as possible to her , and after a while he put his paw through and played with her a little . The young jaguar was very quiet , very undemonstrative , but seemed well pleased , and responded to this little playfulness instantly . She appeared to have no fear , no dislike of any kind , but to be anxious to get out of her own narrow little cage and into his comfortable roomy one . She had been in hers for six long weeks , and was beginning to feel stiff and cramped . When the cages had remained in this position for several days , it was decided , after a consultation , to put the animals in one cage . Not the slightest sign of dislike or annoyance had been shown by either animal , and some of the men thought that unnecessary precautions had been taken . As soon as the keepers began to be busy about the doors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasure . Lopez jumped about , to and fro , and up and down his shelf , as if eager for her entrance ; and , when the doors were finally opened , the young jaguar walked quietly through , with a little gentle purr , and straight up to Lopez , putting her head softly against him with a caressing little movement . Lopez 's Vicious Attack on the Little Jaguar But , as the doors of the cage clanged together , in a flash Lopez 's whole attitude changed . He drew his breath in with a curious hissing sound , ending with a savage , throaty growl ; his eyes blazed fury and hate ; his body grew rigid ; his very fur quivered ; and , before the keepers could do anything , he had sprung at the back of the young jaguar 's neck and sunk his long canine teeth into it . The attack was so quick and so totally unexpected that the poor little newcomer had had no time even to attempt to defend herself . She hung there in his mouth , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including Dr. Hornaday , seized whatever weapons were within reach , and tried to make Lopez loosen his hold . He was prodded in the face with hard-wood poles , beaten over the head with iron pipes , struck fearfully heavy blows over the shoulders and on the nose with an iron scraper , even jabbed on the feet with the pitchfork ? all without the least effect . With tightly shut eyes , angry , throaty growls , and tightened grip , he held on to the dying jaguar , and , raising himself after being partially stunned by one of the blows , he carried her over to another part of his cage . More than a minute passed before a terrific blow over one eye made him loosen his hold , and the poor little jaguar dropped limply and quietly to the floor , where she died almost instantly . Consternation prevailed , for , apart from the  | horror and the shock of the scene , the young jaguar had been procured at enormous expense . The men were determined to get the body of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in doing this they all ran some terrible risks . Finally , when the body had been rescued and had been carefully examined , it was found that two pieces of the neck vertebrae had been completely crushed , while small pieces of bone had even penetrated the spinal cord . The jaguar 's usual mode of killing is to spring at the back of its victim , and by a peculiarly quick movement of its fore paw to twist the victim 's head around , thus breaking its neck . Lopez did no twisting or wrenching . He simply buried his Teeth in the vertebrae of the neck , crushing it as easily as we should crush an eggshell with our fingers . And so , for this , Senor Lopez has been sentenced to solitary confinement for life . No more young companions will be provided for him . He has a comfortable , clean house , good and plentiful food , and every care ; but he will never again have an opportunity to kill anything . And he betrays his resentment and his evil nature daily . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slightest disposition to play , or either to caress or be caressed . Even for his keeper , who has known him for years and feeds him daily , he has nothing but hatred . About two years ago , while he was climbing to the back of his cage on the shelf , in some way or another his foot slipped ? a most unaccountable thing in a jaguar ? and he fell heavily . It was evident that he had hurt himself severely , and every care was taken of him . For a time it was feared that he would have cage paralysis ; but eventually he partially recovered , although to this day he still limps slightly . This fall seems to have added , if that were possible , to his villainous disposition . No man ventures past his cage without watching his every movement ; no man feeds him without taking every precaution to keep out of the way of his treacherous paws . The Little Bear Who Spoiled His Act Bears are particularly interesting animals to study , and no two bears are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this is the reason , I believe , that they respond so well to training and make such excellent performers when trained . One little bear I knew was taught to climb a ladder , pull a string which let loose an American flag , and then jump to the floor and turn a somersault . But the public did not know that in loosening the flag he also let loose a lump of sugar . In time the proprietor of the show was obliged to cut out  | that act , because the little bear would never wait for his signal . The minute he entered the arena , he would go straight up the ladder , pull the string , and get the sugar ; and , since this was arranged as the climax of the entire bear act , he spoiled the whole thing . Punishments had no effect on him ? he did not even resent them ; he went straight after the sugar . Even after his act was taken away from him he would always willingly do any tricks that necessitated the climbing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Silver King One of the most interesting bears I have ever seen is Silver King , the huge polar bear that was captured by Mr. Paul J. Rainey and presented by him to the New York Zoological Park in September , 1910 . His capture took place at Kane Basin in July , 1910 , and he is , I believe , the first bear that has ever been caught by ropes or lassos , and the largest polar bear ever kept in captivity . He weighs more than eight hundred and eighty pounds . For strength , endurance , and savageness Silver King is not to be equaled . From the moment of his capture to the present time he has always been furious , either in wildest rage and despair , or sunk in sullen , morose resentment against everything and everybody . No coaxing with dainties , no kindness , has any effect on him . Mr. Paul Rainey , with Mr. Harry Whitney and their men , first found him on the ice ; they followed him , and , after much trouble and considerable danger , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and enormous strength , they towed him behind their motor-boat to the ship . Here all possible haste was made to arrange the derrick , and , after placing more ropes around him , they hoisted him over the side of the ship and lowered him into the hold . For a few days he was left there without food , while every available man on board was put to work to make a crate that would be strong enough to hold him . As soon as it was finished , the crate was carefully baited with musk-ox meat and lowered into the hold . Silver King hesitated not one moment . Nearly famished with hunger , he went straight into the trap , almost before it had settled on the floor of the hold . Ravenously he attacked the fresh meat , so tempting at all times to a polar bear , and , while he was satisfying his appetite , his captors had plenty of time to fasten him up and see that he was secure . He seemed a little puzzled and uneasy when he finally left off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the food and his long-continued struggles had made him weary and sleepy , and for the first few hours of his crate life he slept heavily , only moaning occasionally and tossing from side to side . But when he awoke , and the added strength from his big meal had given him fresh energy , he roared incessantly , struggled and wrestled with his crate , ? in much the same way that he even now struggles and wrestles with the iron bars of his cage in the park , ? and kept every one on board in a state of anxiety and excitement . There was no let-up with him , no quieting down ; he fought with might and main , and showed that he was going to be a very dangerous animal to land . And so it proved . For , when he arrived at New York , his struggles and rage were such that , in order not to risk human life in transporting him to the park , it was considered advisable to give him a dose of chloroform . But , even then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could do to get him from the traveling-crate safely into the unusually strong cage in the park that had been specially built for him . The photograph on page 158 was taken by flashlight at the very moment of his entering the cage , and shows him standing in a halfdazed fashion , with the nose pointed to the ground . He is a most beautiful animal , well formed and fully developed , but is still angry and vicious , and the only time he ever shows the slightest sign of calmness or contentment is during a snow-storm . He seems then to think of something , lifts his head and nose in the air , sniffs , and holds out his long black tongue to catch the snowflakes . This Baby Eats Thirty Pounds of Fish a Day In delightful contrast to Silver King is the little Atlantic walrus , also caught in Kane Basin at the same time , and presented by Mr. Paul Rainey to the Zoological Park . He is yet a baby , only six months old , and for homeliness and comical facial expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but his keeper , George Snyder , he has nothing but hatred ; but for him he will go anywhere and do anything . His affection began to show itself by his flopping in his awkward way after his keeper every time he moved . For this Keeper Snyder called him Flip-Flop , and this has been shortened to Flip . Mr. Snyder was anxious to weigh him , one day . This would have been something of an undertaking under ordinary circumstances , as the weighing-machine was some distance away . But the gate was opened , the keeper went out , saying , " Come on , Flip ! " and out came the young walrus , and followed him not only to the scales ,  | but on the scales , where , by giving him one or two clams , he was kept long enough to be weighed . Flip weighed at the time of his capture one hundred and fifty pounds . Since then he has gained enormously , as he has a huge appetite . He eats over thirty pounds of fish daily ? three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ codfish , and butterfish , from which all the bones are first carefully removed . He always seems to be ravenously hungry , and eats greedily , with many grunts , puffings , and sighs . He is the most absolutely happy and contented " wild animal " I have ever seen in captivity , just as Silver King is the most restless and discontented . The Elephant that Would Have Whisky Elephants , too , have their individual peculiarities . In the Barnum and Bailey show there was , a short time ago , an extremely clever performing elephant named Sultan . His chief act was sitting on a stool with uplifted fore paws , on each of which sat a little dog , while a third dog sat on his head . When performing , Sultan was the most gentle and docile of elephants ; but downstairs in his stables he had his whims and moods . He greatly disliked to have any stranger come to his stables . One day , when , in order to propitiate him , he had been given a pail of some good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped eating for a moment , looked at me with his tiny eyes , and then , drawing the mash up in his trunk , deliberately threw it all over me . In one of the large animal shows , it became evident , one evening , that the chief performing elephant was too sick to do his act . This meant that no elephant performance could be given , since he led the others . The trainers gave him a dose of hot whisky and onions ? a favorite medicine with elephants . He sucked up a large pailful of this mixture , and evidently wanted more . He was so much better in an hour that he was able to perform as usual . But , after this , he would never give a performance without his dose of hot whisky and onions . No threats or persuasions could induce ' him to go on without it . Supplying the elephant with a pailful of whisky twice a day proved to be so expensive that the proprietor finally had to cut his act out altogether . In his quarters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arena , the elephant never appeared to think of the whisky . The Baboon Mat Drank the Baby 's Milk Baboons are ugly-tempered , vicious , and treacherous animals , and very few show much affection even for those who have cared for them for years . Very little has ever been done in the way of training them ; trainers generally fight shy of them . I knew a large baboon whose education was undertaken by a man who had made a great success in training other wild animals . The animal , frightened and half dazed by a long sea and land journey , arrived at the show in a most miserable condition . He sat in one corner of his cage , looking out from under his cavernous eyebrows in sullen , resentful silence . The trainer began by coaxing and offering the baboon everything in the way of food that he could think of . He could not get him to take even milk . Finally , he put the milk into a bottle , took another bottle himself , and , standing in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the baboon watching him in the same sullen silence . He then left the animal for a while , and on his return found the second bottle empty , and the baboon sitting in his usual corner , but looking quite content . From that time , the animal seemed as much drawn to the trainer as the trainer was to him , and took his bottle of milk daily . In time he took other food , and soon became quite tame , even following the trainer about the show during the hours when the public was not admitted . The trainer 's wife had a young baby , and the baboon was greatly interested in it . He would look at it , examine it carefully , and always  | seemed anxious to take hold of it ; but this the mother would never allow , and , in fact , she was always uneasy when the animal was about . One day , when the trainer brought him into their room , the young mother had just prepared the baby 's bottle , and laid it down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often watched her feed the baby before , and always seemed intensely interested . On this particular occasion , his master being occupied with something else , the baboon took up the baby 's bottle , put the nipple in his mouth , and , by the time the mother came to take it , had drained every drop of the milk . The mother was also a performer in the show , and found it pretty difficult to keep up her performances , see to a young baby , and also do all her own cooking and housekeeping . It was only natural that she should be annoyed when she realized that she had not only lost the milk , but that she would have to light the stove again and warm some more . In her vexation , she struck the baboon a smart blow on the side of the head . There was a scream of rage , and the next moment the baboon had torn the baby away from her . Rescue of the Trainer 's Baby The trainer , as it happened , had been preparing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case of any accident during his afternoon performance , and he had not yet corked it when the baboon seized his baby . Being a particularly quick-witted man , he promptly put the bottle under the baboon 's nose . The fumes nearly suffocated the animal for a moment ; he dropped the baby , and , stuffing his hands into his smarting and halfblinded eyes , with another wild scream he flew out of the room and through the building . Every animal about ' the place seemed to know instinctively that something had happened . The lions roared , the elephants trumpeted , the hyenas and wolves howled as they alone know how to howl , and from everywhere came men ready to help in an emergency . The trainer soon made known what had happened , but they could not find the baboon anywhere . Every hole and corner in the show that they could think of was searched , and the buildings and grounds outside ; but no sign of him was to be found . The Baby Missing As the time for the afternoon performance drew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Special extra men were procured , and stationed in different parts of the building , with orders to keep the most careful watch for the baboon during the performance . But the afternoon drew to a close , and nothing had been seen or heard of the animal . The proprietor felt that it was safer , however , to give notice to the police that a baboon had been lost . It seemed wiser to say nothing to the public , but the precautions for their safety were continued throughout the day and evening . The evening performance was well on its way , when the greatest consternation prevailed among the trainers on hearing from one of the women performers that the baby that had been the cause of the trouble had disappeared . When this news was brought , the young mother was just going through her performance with her three bears , and could not , of course , be told . Her husband , nearly frantic with grief , waited until she had smilingly bowed her farewell to the audience , in response to the chord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three bears into their several cages behind the runway . Then , trembling from head to foot , but trying to conceal his anxiety , he accompanied her back to their room , wondering how he should break the news to her . It surprised him somewhat that she did not go up to the baby 's crib ; but he was still more surprised when , on telling her that the baby was missing , she only laughed ! She explained to . him that , terrified at the thought of leaving the baby alone , even with locked doors , after her experience of the morning , she had asked a neighbor near by to take care of the child for the evening . The relief of the trainer can be imagined . He and his wife decided to have some supper before they went for the baby , and , while she was cooking it , the trainer went downstairs to fetch two bottles of beer , which he kept in a little closet . When he opened the door , he was nearly knocked down by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who had been locked up all day . He must have rushed in there in the morning , when the door had been left open for a few moments , and the trainer had turned the key on him . The alarm was raised , and , after a chase and a struggle , the baboon was bound securely with ropes and put back into his cage , from which he was never again allowed to emerge . The man who had thrown himself on the animal and bound him had his thumb bitten through . The two dozen bottles of beer in the closet had been smashed to atoms . Either the baboon thought they all contained the dreadful ammonia that had nearly suffocated him , or he broke them out of sheer fury . From that time on , the mere sight of a bottle always threw him into a paroxysm of rage .  | A Vindictive Snake In Stellingen Park , in Hamburg , where Mr. Carl Hagenbeck has his enormous collection of wild animals , an incident occurred in the summer of 1904 which showed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his son Heinrich , and several other men were one day packing up four pythons in order to send them to the St. Louis Exhibition . The snakes measured from twenty to twenty-six feet each . After all was in readiness , Heinrich Hagenbeck opened the door of the cage , when , instantly , without a moment 's warning , all four pythons flew at him , with extended jaws . So totally unexpected was the attack that one of the pythons almost succeeded in coiling himself round the young man . Fortunately , he was quick to realize the danger , and , using all his strength , he finally freed himself , with the help of his father and the keepers . Three of the pythons were quickly covered with sacks ; but the biggest one of all , a huge , vindictive , savage reptile , weighing about two hundred pounds , glided to one of the rafters at the top of the cage , and , hanging on by his tail , swung his wicked head backward and forward , doing his very best to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by a dexterous throw , one of the men covered his head with a sack , and the rest closed round him and used all their strength to detach him from the rafter . But the snake was so powerful that the men could not even loosen his hold ; they had to send for assistance before they could detach him from the rafter to which he hung . While they were still struggling with him , almost exhausted , the python , with a quick , vindictive twist of his lithe body , actually got his tail round the right leg of Heinrich Hagenbeck , and with lightning rapidity began working his coils up and around his body . Tired and exhausted as the men were , they realized that it was now a matter of life and death , and for a few minutes every man there put forth his whole strength and strained every nerve to loosen that terrible hold . At last , by a supreme effort , the reptile was torn away and the young man was released . It is curious that all these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A Snake-Charmer 's Pet Miss X --  , a snake-charmer well known among show people , firmly believed that one of her snakes was really fond of her . She could do anything with it ? fondle it , kiss and caress . it . She grew so fond of it that at last she even let it sleep on her bed , to the great disgust of the other performers in the show . She would eat her meals with this horrible thing coiled round her neck ; and once , in very warm weather , she took it under her coat into the woods with her , and let it amuse itself by crawling over the ground . She followed it about and kept a most careful watch over it ( it was a valuable performer ) , but it showed no disposition to go off into the woods , as she feared it might , but came back to her and coiled round her as usual . She was warned several times that the reptile was very dangerous , but she grew more and more reckless , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And then , one day , without any warning , directly after a performance , when she was caressing it in her own room , the snake suddenly threw back its head , looked at her steadily , and with lightning-like swiftness struck her between the eyes , leaving two tiny punctures . She hastily uncoiled it and thrust it into its box ; but she died within half an hour .
