Tl1E career of Jesus was a romantic poem , an epic of passion and grief and heroic hope ? one of the terrific tragedies in the Wars of God . It everywhere touches on the Ideal , the one eternal kingdom of poesy . It begins with a soft idyl of wonder and joy , passes through whirlwind and earthquake , rising at last to the white calm of eternity . In the days of Herod the king there was an expectancy in all hearts , an upward looking on all faces . With the coming of the lilies in March , " the Angel Gabriel was sent from God , to a city of Galilee named Naza reth , " to announce to a virgin that she should bring forth a son and call his name Jesus . It was an obscure annunciation to a young Hebrew maiden , but how trivial beside it are all the flamboyant proclamations of the Clusars and the Pharaohs ! Next we find this virgin mother knocking at the doors in little Bethle hem , asking for a place to lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wings and a transport of holy passion up in the soft ethereal fields of air . Seraphs dipped their feet into the gray morning of our little world . It was " good tidings to all people ! " For in the bibles of all lands had been inscribed the hope of an Avatar , the descent of a Divine Child to poise the shaken earth . This babe from the hollow of the manger was the child that the Aryan poets had beheld in vision rising out of the hollow of the lotos-flower that floats upon the immeasurable waters of the Mother-sea . The ancient Vedas had said of him : " In the beginning arose the Golden Child : he was the only born Lord of all that is . He stablished the earth and this sky . " The Sibyls had also whispered of the wonder in their secret books . The poet-prophets of Israel had caught the vision ; and the impassioned Isaiah , looking down the centuries , had cried : " TJnto us a child is born , unto us a son is given , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his name shall be called Wonderful . " The wise magi of Persia ? so runs tradition ? also waited for the Avatar . For ages twelve searchers of the skies had kept vigil upon the lofty towers , watching for the Saviour Star ; and now the wise men were hastening over the Syrian sands . A beautiful and mysterious trembling was going out upon the hearts of men . Strange rumors were running on all roads . Shepherds , watching their flocks by night , heard the embassy of angels announcing the new king ; and straightway they left their sheep on David 's hill and went hastening to pay homage to the babe lying in the fragrant hay of the manger , where the oxen warmed the little one with their breath , where the cart-wheel leaned to the wall and the plough and yoke were resting idly in an empty corner . Convoyed by a strange new star ( was it an angel in the form of a star ? ) came the wise men drawn out of the cryptic East , with myrrh for the mortal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now warned by a dream , Joseph with the young child and the mother fled from the wrath of Herod into Egypt , to wander for years in that strange land whose imperishable stones whisper of eternity . Did the young child stray among the reeds and lilies of the Nile ? Did he pass the Pyramids that hold the humbled dust of Memphian kings ? Did he return the solemn gaze of the Sphinx ? Mystery staring upon Mystery ? Three years they wandered , fill the angel of the dream pointed them back to the land of Israel , to storied Galilee . One swift line tells all his youth ? " Iie grew in grace and stature , in favor with God and man . " So that white childhood is swept into the innocent silence of all childhood . We think of it as going lightly , like a rose-leaf dancing on the shining floor of a river . The growing boy spent beautiful years at Nazareth , a little hill-nested Galilean village , with the low peaks notching the skies around it . Behind him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and yet he mingled in sweet democracy with all the folk of the town . He had comrades , perhaps , in all the gray little houses whose flat roofs were shared with the doves and the wandering vines . He knew the terraced gardens and the one fountain where the women came with their urns for water . He must have known as old friends all the rocks and trees along the hoof-beaten trails that pronged out from Nazareth . Often he must have lain on the grassy hillsides watching the ant tugging its load over twig and pebble to its hidden barns , or stood looking up at the swallows building their happy Bahylons under the eaves of the synagogue . Often perhaps the little warm fingers came bringing flowers from the wild gardens that made clouds of color on the hills ? pimpernels , anemones , morning glories , geraniums , rock-roses . No doubt those eager boyish eyes watched the figs of the orchard rounding their velvet purses of preciousness and the grapes of the vineyard orbing into dusty purple . We can well believe that nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and evanescent . He saw the thin reed of the pool shaken in the wind ; the tender branch putting forth its green leaves in the April light ; the lilies in their glory trembling in the dark furrow ; the birds feeding as the guests of God . Perhaps , too , the curious , earnest boy spent lingering hours at the market-place and the fountain , questioning and listening as the dusty caravans passed to and fro ? Syrians , Romans , Arabs , Phoenicians , Greeks . For through the low hills of Nazareth went pulsing three of the ancient highways ? one the way to Tyre and Sidon by the sea , one the way to Damascus , one the way to Rome . All the civilizations of the world sent some waft of their rumor and fragrance through the crooked streets of the little Galilean town . But the boy 's heart was drawn doubtless with a tender interest to the low shop , where with Joseph the carpenter he spent long hours among the fragrant chips and shavings torn from cedars of Lebanon and oaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While his hand was learning to saw the straight line , his mind was learning to follow the straight line of rectitude ; and while his arm was learning to send home the wooden nail , his mind was learning to drive the truth to its ultimate reach . And all the while his heart was quickening under the poetry of the strange scriptures descended from the mysterious antiquity of his race . His earliest memory was perhaps a memory of his poet-mother 's voice singing her Magnificat , or crooning some chant that sheltered the heart of the nation ; as , " Behold , He that kcepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep . " But the wondrous boy must have ever been touched with that high seriousness , that noble sorrow , which is the mark of all great souls . And we can well believe that again and again lie climbed alone to the top of the little hill to the west , leaving behind the cisterns , the olive orchards , the vineyards , the tombs in the cliffs , and the oleander thickets , mounting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away into the interminable distances and to muse over the mystery of it all . There at his feet lay Galilee , all fragrant and bright in the rich Eastern air . Far in the north swam the ghostly peak of Hermon . Toward the east was the light-hung cone of Tabor , and a thin gleam of the blue Tiberias . Farther toward the south shot up the dim peaks of Gilboa , and the more shadowy peaks of Gilead that are beyond the tumultuous flood of the Jordan . On the west the gazing boy could discern in violet light the laurelled ridges of Carmel that plunge down to the sea , far peaks where Elijah had parleyed with the prophets of Baal and cried the prayer that called down the fire . And there farther toward the north , he caught the faint sparkle of the Mediterranean , whose shores were to echo his name down all the ages of the world . So on the little hill behind Nazareth , the boy stood wondering over the immensity without him and the infinity within him ? wondering over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ebbing and flowing around the mystery of our pain . Again and again the proud city of Jerusalem sweeps into the story , touching it always with shadow and portent . At twelve years of age , the boy went with his parents to the Passover feast in the great city . The journey must have been rich with meaning and marvel . Mile by mile the heroic past of Israel unrolled : here was Jericho , there was Jordan , yonder was the plane of Esdraelon that had been watered by the battle-blood of all kingdoms and ages . And further on was Jerusalem , where the towers cried their memories and the gates their glory . Slowly the great idea of History took form within him . As he neared the Temple , he touched the converging streams of pilgrims from many lands ; and soon he felt the shock of the crowded and excited city , the city consecrated by memories of the grief of Jeremiah , the poetry of David , and the lofty passion of Isaiah . Everywhere drifting about the young boy were throngs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cunning Arabs , grave Ro mans , graceful Greeks . Now , if never before , the vast idea of Iumanity swept as a solemn vision over the sensitive mind of the growing boy . Long thoughts of things that had been and that were to be now passed across his wistful , wondering heart . At twelve years his form fades and his voice is heard to cease . Up to this hour his life had been one lyric of serenity and joy ? a song of the skylark in the first brightness of the morning . Now eighteen years of silence engulf his works and his ways . Astounding reticence in one so rich in wisdom and eloquence ! Was he sequestered in the clefts and canyons of Galilee pondering the problem of our sorrows ? Was he train ing himself at plough and mill and carpenter 's bench that he might know the ache in the back and the ache in the heart of those that " labor and are heavy laden " ? Or did he go wandering through old cities and lands to know yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the cliffs of Parnassus , pausing at Delphi to hear some word of the dying oracle of the Pythian Apollo ? Did he look on the many-volumed learning of Alexan dria ? Did he stand in the ruined porches of the palaces of On , brooding over the dust of fallen gods and the humbled pride of men ? Did he journey past Tadmore in the desert , past golden Ophir , pushing back the doors of the East to hold communion with the Magi of Iran and the more ancient hierophants of hoary Ind ? All this may have been , still I like to think that Jesus thought out life 's difficult and anxious problems while he worked at the carpenter 's bench . And I like to think of that last day when the purpose to go forth to the Father 's greater business was finally fixed in his heart ? the day when he finished the plough and the yoke he had been making , and then hung up his saw on its wooden nail and laid away the adze and axe and hammer in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how he swept up the littered floor , leaving all clean and orderly behind him . Then as he stepped out into the air of the early spring , I fancy how he paused a moment on the edge of the slope for a last look at Nazareth nested among the low bills , then turned and pressed on never to waver in that suhlin e devotion to conscience that drew him on to Calvary . And as he went did he see it all ? the message , the rejection , the cross , and then the long ages wherein men would take his name but neglect his man-dates ? Eighteen years of silence . . . and lo , a Voice in the Wilderness ! It is the hairy Baptist come from his long struggle with the Unseen . The Spirit of the Desert is upon him , and he cries a glowing message that sweeps all Judea into the flame of its burning . Suddenly Jesus appears from the north to enter on his lonely and terrible apostolate . Kings are silent , priests make no sign . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one but John of the Sands ! He bears witness ; yet behind hint stands no dominion , no hierarchy , no tradition ? only the Desert ! So John looms up out of the wilderness , crying , " Repent ye , for the kingdom of heaven is at hand ! " It was a cry of revolt , a clarion of conscience , the herald of the coming hero . At the ford of the Jordan , Jesus is suddenly hailed as the Messiah by this Voice of the Desert ? hailed as the one who should " baptize with fire , " who should touch life with a white and sacred passion . Hereupon comes a Voice from Heaven bearing witness to the young prophet , as he enters upon the long career weighted with the fate of men . Now breaks in a crash of tragic chords . For at this cry from the heavens , he is shaken with new strange questions of deed and destiny ? How ? When ? Whither ? Should he fight the world with flame from hell or with fire from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the wilderness to be tempted of the Devil . Only the tempted can reach holiness , for holiness is conquered territory . To every strong man comes the watch in the wilderness and the dread hour of the questionings : " Shall I take the easy way or the hard way ? Shall it be mammon or manhood ? Shall it be a coward safety or a lyric dare ? " So Jesus was driven into the solitary mountains of Moab beyond the Jordan , away among sterile cliffs of hoary stone , hollowed with caves and furrowed by ravines ? a lair of wild beasts . The first days were doubtless days of rapture and passionate peace ; for had he not heard a Voice from Heaven saying , " This is my beloved son ! " Rapture and passionate peace , for he knew his spirit to be one with the Father , knew his will to be one with the cosmic will . Forty days he fasted among the grim gorges . He was alone with deso lation , in the abode of demons , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scorched rocks ; and over his head at night was the heaven of stars , with great Orion pulsing on the rim . Long , long thoughts must have passed over his mind as he wandered in the bare brown solitudes , pondering the mystery of our world . Suddenly the Tempter of men and gods appeared , and Jesus stood facing the two careers possible to men and gods . The Son of Man must choose . It was the battle of the soul with the World Spirit . We seem to hear the Dark Voice cry , " Fool , fool ! only the old way is the safe way . I am the god of this world , and I give to whomsoever I will . Kneel to me , and I will give you all . Kneel to me : there is no other God ! " And we hear the young seer answer , " Get thee behind me , Satan ! " And again the Dark Voice cries , " Son of Genius , reject me and I will crush you . Son of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Ca'sar . Re nounce your dreams ! " And again we hear the irrevocable answer , " Get thee behind me , Satan ! " And now at this lyric height of the soul , a new rapture thrilled over the lonely desert watcher , a waft of mystic wind from secret worlds . He had sounded the inward deeps of his own being , probed into the soul and its mystery . In that hour , the horizon of consciousness widened within him . He passed more deeply into humanity , into God ? became the Mes siah through the free energy of the unconquerable will ? became the Mes siah , the Son of the Highest . So for a dark season the lyric seer faced the visage of the Abyss . He weighed the bribes of Hell and put them by . He would not win his way to empire through privilege and pride , through miracle and the sword : he would appeal only to the reason of the heart . Jesus saw deep enough to know that love is the meaning of the world 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would set his steps in a new path : he would summon men to the beautiful adventure of love . He would sweep away the cold prose prudence of the world , and call men to the lyrical wisdom of the heroic life . Now suddenly the young Messiah returned to Galilee and began to say , " Repent ye , for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand . " In the poetic pas sion of his spirit , he had rejected " the kingdoms of the world . " He would establish a kingdom of a higher order , a kingdom founded on ser vice and self-denial ? a kingdom that would be rejected by the proud prince and satisfied Pharisee , but welcomed by " the poor in spirit " and by those " who hunger and thirst after righteousness . " So he set himself to the organization of a social order that should shift the centre of spiritual gravity from a common greed to a common God , from private weal to the commonweal . Love was to be dramatized in life : the state was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! this purpose to unite the sacred and the secular , to give the Spirit a working body in the world . Jesus spent a golden season near the Sea of Galilee , threading his way among the reeds in the shallows , among the oleanders on the shores , and up among the gardens on the soft slopes of the low hills . After the stern peaks and naked rocks of the desert , came the plashing waters of Galilee , with the gulls dipping to the waves and the clouds of pigeons homing in slow circles to the gray cliffs . Here , on the way from Damascus to the Mediterranean , he saw the long caravans go creeping down the road with cargoes of myrrh , spices , and balm of Gilead , leaving their fragrant odors upon the soft wind . Here he saw the rich Romans sweep by in chariots with gleaming wheels or in barges with flashing oars . He beheld their palaces and votive temples in the groves , and looked perhaps upon the statues of bearded Pan and on the more beautiful forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the lost secret of earthly joy . Crowds thronged out to hear his strange and daring discourse . There were blind men feel ing their way ; sick men carried on their beds ; women robed in white and azure ; scoffing Pharisees with broad phylacteries on their foreheads ; haughty scribes with fringed and tasseled robes ; wondering merchants on their camels dusty and worn by the road ; Herodians clad in purple , look ing on with supercilious eye . Sometimes Jesus spoke from a boat , sometimes from a hillside ; and sometimes all the city were gathered together by his door in the first hush of the coming night . So passed his Galilean days touched with a light from the Ideal . How strange it must have seemed to those crowds with their up-wondering faces and their dim , half-awakened lives . Earnest men heard in his poesy the meanings that had ever stammered on their own lips . It was all a lyric wisdom keen with the life of the moment ? a wisdom deeper than Solomon sounded in the Temple , a wisdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his presence the peace they had longed for through the travail of a lifetime . They felt the thrill of beauty men would feel should they come suddenly upon the starry heaven after it had been hidden away for a thousand years . But as the green leaves were looking forth in the April light , Jesus left the quiet of Galilee for the press and pageant of Jerusalem . Everywhere the pilgrim caravans were winding among blossoming almonds and olive trees whose leaves were turning silver at every little wind . One stride carried him from word to deed . Suddenly we see him in the mood of the artist , angered at moral ugliness and scourging from the temple the coarse crew that profaned the shrine of beauty . Soon he was back again in Galilee , passing from place to place , as teacher , consoler , healer . He was a fountain of energies to the wasted and way-worn : he gave out life as a harp gives out music . It was not miracle , but Law . It was all as natural as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lame cast their crutches into the fire : at his touch , the blind looked again upon the beauty of the day . But greater wonders were to come : in the might of the Mystic Power under which he was mov ing , the dead would take on the color of life again , ' coming softly back from the Silence to whisper the story of it all at the wondering fireside . Now in the Sermon on the Mount he outlines the Constitution of the New Order , founded on unselfish service and lighted by the poet 's dream . In this New Order , whoever is struck oil one cheek shall turn the other , whoever asks for a coat shall get a cloak also . Indeed , we are told that no one will need to take thought for his life , " what he shall cat or what he shall drink ; nor yet for his body , what he shall put on . " These things will be provided in the Kingdom . All shall live the care-free life of the wild birds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sow not , neither do they reap , nor gather into barns : yet your heavenly Father feedeth them . " It was the passionate purpose of Jesus to draw men out of their sterile prose life into the lyrical life of his Comrade Kingdom . So he turned to the heavy-laden world and cried , " Come unto me , and I will give you rest ! " What an astounding promise to issue from the lips of a lonely wayfarer , this man with no purse , no prestige , no party , no palace . ' It was the poet 's dream , the divine dare . He had rest for all the world ? for the pleasure seekers pallid in their pleasures , for the rich men poor in their riches , for the toilers robbed of the fruits of their toil , and for all the hordes of the miserable that drift down into the poverties and horrors of great cities . In the dimensions of his compassion , he had rest even for the priests in their impieties and for the kings in their trea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ireland in her miseries , India in her poverties , France in her revolutions , Russia in her wrongs ; and yet he could bear away the burden of it all . He turned to the world lying dumb and desolate under the blight of selfishness , and he made it all his own territory to be transformed by heroic love into something beautiful and heavenly . Rest , rest from hate and rest from greed , rest that would give time for love and joy ? this was the world 's great need . Sages had sought for it ; illuminati had longed for it ; magi had waited for it ; and now here was a young carpenter from unlettered Nazareth , who came declaring that he carried the world 's secret in his breast . For a season the people were drawn by the ideal sentiment and poetic utterance of tiie young Messiah . They " heard him gladly " in those first hours before they had conic to know the searching self-renunciation that is the door to his Kingdom . Then they fell away , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completely with the Tradition of the Elders , and dark antagonisms began to wall him in . Finally , as the preacher of the higher law and order of his Comrade Kingdom , he was rejected and despised by the ruling classes as the enemy of " law and order . " Ile was a marked man , a dangerous character . Because of his battle with a dead church . and his toil with a lifeless following , his sacred strength was wasted ; so that again and again he was forced to flee to the desert and the mountain to refresh his worn spirit in the ancient quiets and the unwanted fountains of the Divine . More and more he bent under the weight of the burden . Little by little a lonely sublimity settled down upon his life . He was one man against the world . It is ever so : all prophets are rejected ? Socrates is murdered , Dante is exiled . All are rejected till they pass from human vision : then their gospels of deliverance are translated into a fiction of compromise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in spite of human failure , Jesus had his moments of joy , moments of beautiful communion with the central Peace . We are told of one night of stars and wonder ? one rift of rapture in the descending doom . With three disciples ? his dearest ones ? he climbed the long slope of Hermon in the cool of the afternoon . Far to the south was a glint of the Sea of Galilee among the golden hills . The shadow of Hermon , like a prostrate pyramid , slanted seventy miles across the valley of Damascus , away toward parched Arabia . Flushes of ruby and mists of amethyst filled the evening sky , waning slowly into the soft silver of the dusk , as the sun slid down to burn a fiery moment on the sea beyond Tyre and Sidon . It was an hour of solemn quiet broken only by the delicate fall of far waters or the low call of a late bird homing to its nest on the secret bough . The dark gathered , and the stars took their ancient places . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when suddenly his garments became dazzling white as snow , and the fashion of his countenance was altered , and his face did shine as the sun . Let us not wonder at this sacred mystery , for he had taken his divine degree , had entered into the universal sympathies . So shall it be with all who overcome the world : their faces shall grow luminous . Divine passion throws out upon the countenance a mysterious splendor . There is a solar light that shines from heroic faces ? a light that awes while it rejoices , that hushes while it attracts . Is it not written that in the end of days " the righteous shall shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of the Father " ? And the poet David sings that " God is a sun , " that he " covers himself with light as with a garment . " So in the Christ , garmented with light , men may find the Solar Word ? find all that Hellas dreamed of in sunbright Apollo , all that Persia cried to in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Balder the Beautiful . And in that glorious moment on the mountain , Moses and Elias stood beside the Christ ? the patriots of Israel beside the patriot of humanity . And in that moment of joy they talked with him of his nearing death . Strange union tere of ecstasy and pain , of noble rapture and heroic grief . Who knows , indeed , but that these two great emotions are one ? Who knows but that sacrifice is the very heart of every noble joy ? Now he has reached the hour of the great resolve . Antagonisms are closing in upon him like iron walls . At last he will descend to Jeru salem to face the Pharisees in that place of plottings . As he nears the doomed city he sees its proud palaces , its massive walls , its countless towers , all glistening in the morning light and yet impermanent to his far-seeing eye ? impermanent as the shapes of summer cloud that the next wind will blow to nothingness . But a rift of light broke across the dark . For as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of palms and went out to meet him , spreading their garments in his way and crying , " Hosanna , blessed is the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord ! " For an hour ? but only for an hour ? it looked as though the Christ-passion had touched the people , and that " a nation would be born in a day . " But alas , the rude chords of the world came crashing in upon this idyl of love and joy ; and hope and dream were gone again . For soon we hear that piteous cry of the heart , " 0 Jerusalem , Jerusalem , how often would I have gathered thy children together even as a hen gathers her chickens under her wings , and ye would not ! " So the final day darkens upon him . Yet he never loses the high state : he goes about the duty of the hour as one who has business in remote ages . More than Dantean in its pathos and dignity is that last supper in the upper chamber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the while that one of them has betrayed him to death for a handful of silver . Piteously tender and majestic are his parting words : " But I say unto you that I shall not drink hereafter of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it with you in my Father 's kingdom . Let not your hearts be troubled : ye believe in God , believe also in me . " Touched with pity and terror is that little garden of Gethsemane , its shivering olives white in the moon as he prays that prayer carrying all the heart-break of humanity ? that shadowed garden so suddenly lighted by the torches of the Temple guards come to seize the son of Peace . Now the hours run swiftly to the end . Soon the young seer is out on the Via Dolorosa , the way of sorrow to the hill of agony . They are sending to the cross the one whose only crime was his purpose to form a church that should be a Social Paradise , to build a state that should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no throne for him but the Cross ! Here was the master of words , yet think how few his words as he goes down to death . There is one cry in that last hour in Gethsemane . Then he is still : Pilate trembles before the thunder of that silence . As the shames are heaped on the pale sufferer , he rises ever higher in a divine dignity , till he stands solitary in moral grandeur . Once he cries on the road to the awful hill , " Daughters of Jerusalem , weep not for me , but for yourselves and for your children . " And he cries his forgiveness from the accursed tree ; and then he turns to a thief on the next cross and snatches his soul from death with those nailed and bleeding hands . Jesus was a king in the judgment hall ; on the cross he was a God ! Nothing in Eschylean drama rises to the tragic height of the last hours of Jesus in the courts and streets of Jerusalem and on the horrible hill beyond the gates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Tribunal , clad in mocking purple , sceptred with a reed , crowned with oaken thorns , he stands , while the soldiers kneel in ironic homage , crying , " Hail , king ! " Then the rabble drag him through the streets , spit upon him , buffet him , jeer him . Out on the hill the priests and politicians of Judea spike him to the cross . . . . 0 pitiless priests , when were you not waiting to stone the prophet who cries your impieties ? 0 pliant politicians , when were you not waiting to crush the reformer who uncovers your treasons ? But the tragic spectacle moves on . In the sixth hour , Jesus cries with a loud voice , " It is finished ! " Nature too is wrenched with agony : the sun is darkened , the earth trembles , the dead arise and flee through the streets of the city . To all appearance , the Hero of the Cross had gone down in final overthrow . Near the gate of a city " a disturber " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on from afar and a swarm of impious soldiers casting dice under the bleeding feet . In the long vista of time would it not all seem only a momentary whirl of insects in the gray light of an endless road ? No , verily , for soon this obscure cross would be lifted up until its shadow fell across the world , across the heavens . It was soon to become the eternal symbol of the sacrifice that is at the heart of all heroic life , the symbol of " the lamb slain from the foundation of the world . " That which was small as historic fact was soon to become stupendous as poetry . In the light of the cross , men were to see the diviner joy and more glorious meaning of their existence . It was to become poetry to them , the poetry that arouses and redeems the world . To all appearance , the Dark Powers had broken forever the hope of humanity : the Deliverer was dead , his body sealed in a sepulchre of stone . But this tomb was only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of redemption . For while the bruised body was lying in the grave-linen , the Hero was treading the dim roads of the old abyss , preach ing to " the spirits in prison , " setting free the captives , and lighting lamps for the souls lost in the dark . Nor are his followers left with the world all black and their hearts dead within them . Softer notes steal in after the crash of doom : after the tempest comes a hush of stars . A few trernbling friends lay the Hero in a rock-built tomb , and roll a stone against the door . He is next seen in the soft early morning of the third day , walking among the trees in the Garden of the Sepulchre . By the strong lever of the Law , he has forced himself back again into earthly vision . He walks at peace with the Mag dalen in the lilted garden , and on a blossoming road he journeys with two whose eyes are holden . Twice in an upper chamber and once at the seaside , he appears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes to them at their homely work . Beside the sea , where he found his first dis ciples , he gives his last tender command : " Feed my lambs , feed my sheep . " Then on the appointed mountain , in a still dawn , he parts from them all , and the heaven receives him from their mortal eyes ? the morning drinks up the morning star . So runs in outline this life that is a poem , a poem struck through with chords of grief and tenderness , of faith and failure , of unreckoned valors and unpublished victories ? a poem unparalleled in the pathos of its pain and in the tragic passion of its catastrophe . It everywhere rises to the lyric levels of the spirit . It is an epic of service and sorrow , a story of treason and tragedy , ending in lofty harmonies of hope and joy . And all the long centuries since Calvary , the Crucified has been faith ful to love , preparing the " many mansions , " setting in order the nations of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Warrior in the world-struggle . He has travelled the road . Up lonely and terrible pathways of battle , pressing forever on , this Lover and Hero has won the right to be our God !
