To understand the world in which Ceasar lived it is necessary first to review the growth of the Roman Empire . Four hundred years before the beginning of the Christian era Rome was a small city , an independent state , it is true , but in possession of a territory no larger than an American county . In a succession of wars lasting through a century and a third ( 400-264 B. C. ) , she gained control the whole peninsula of Italy . In another century ( 264-167 B. C. ) , through a new series of wars , she built up an empire that nearly surrounded Mediterranean Sea . This rapid expansion of power is one of the most notable events in the world 's history . In the present number of The Mentor , however , we are less concerned with the process of conquest than with its result . When Rome subdued a foreign state , she exercised her right of war in depriving it of a great part of its wealth , including money , land , and art  | treasures , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intrinsic value in bronze , silver , and gold . These confiscations and the subsequent taxes levied by the imperial government , together with the illegal exactions of officials , tended to impoverish the world for the enrichment of Rome and of the few citizens who monopolized the offices . The conquest differentiated the freemen of the empire into three distinct classes : the few wealthy Romans , who governed the world , the masses of Roman citizens who , though in possession of the right to vote had gained no advantage by the conquest , and the subjects , barred from all share in the imperial government and greatly oppressed by its officials . Rome became a great city with a population of about a million , who had gathered from all parts of the empire . Some had come as slaves , others to seek their fortunes , while others had been driven from the surrounding districts by the pinch of poverty . As freemen could find little work in the city , there grew up a great mob of idlers , who lived in large part on food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their votes . The ruling class was represented by the Senate , which was the chief governing body . Generally the senators were the most cultured and intelligent people at Rome ; but they had all the faults of a narrow plutocracy ; through long enjoyment of wealth and power the class was thoroughly corrupted and enfeebled . Hence the Senate proved incapable of governing and protecting the empire and even of preventing the frequent outbreaks of anarchy in the capital . Early Life of Caesar Such in brief was the world in which Caius Julius Caasar lived ( 100-44 B. C. ) Belonging to the bluest-blooded aristocracy , he began life with all the advantages of wealth and family repute . As a boy and youth he enjoyed the best education of the time . It consisted mainly in the study and  | imitation of Greek writers , especially orators , in preparation for a career as public speaker and statesman . Rome had derived her civilization from Greece ; and every business man or diplomatist had to speak the Greek language , which was the chief medium of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young aristocrats Caesar in early life indulged in all the dissipations and vices of his class . The foppish negligence of his attire proclaimed him a rake , while exorbitant luxuries , costly entertainments , forbidden love-intrigues , gambling in brief , the indulging of a great variety of expensive tastes exhausted his fortune and loaded him with debts so portentous that he could never hope to pay them by legal means . Through all these immoralities he kept a sound mind and a body capable of extreme activity and endurance , though in his later years he was subject to fainting and to epileptic fits . The clearness and quickness of his intelligence was such that he could carry on several lines of thought and keep a number of stenographers* occupied simultaneously with his dictations . These extraordinary mental powers enabled him to master the most complex political situations and on the battlefield to turn many a defeat into victory . For the knowledge necessary to his manifold activities he devoured the contents of a multitude of books on a great variety of subjects . He was an orator of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a man of scientific taste , interested in the customs and character of the peoples with whom he came in contact , and in the phenomena of nature ; a general with few equals in the world 's history , and a statesman variously estimated by modern historians . At the beginning of his career he cast his lot with the popular party . This policy meant little more than a preference for dealing with the Assembly rather than with the Senate . In theory the Assembly comprised all the citizens ; practically it was attended by the idler members of the populace . There was no democracy ; for those citizens that lived too far from Rome to attend the Assembly had no voice in the government , and the vast majority of people in the empire were subjects . It was expected that a leader of the popular party should propose to the Assem- bly bills for the benefit of the masses of citizens , particularly of the populace , and for checking the powers and privileges of the aristocracy . Caesar was by no means a believer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funeral of an aunt , he gave the following account of his family 's genealogy : " My aunt Julia derived her lineage on her mother 's side from a race of kings , and on her father 's side from the immortal gods ; for her mother 's family trace their origin to King Ancus Marcius , and her father 's to Venus , of whose stock we are a branch . We unite in our pedigree , accordingly , the sacred majesty of kings , who are the most exalted among men , and the divine majesty of gods , to whom kings themselves are subject . " Men of such pretensions could never descend to the level of peasants and artisans , nor believe that the world would benefit by popular rule . His Wars and His Consulship Through an attractive personality , political intrigue sometimes verging dangerously on conspiracy , and the lavish use of borrowed money , Cesar rapidly made his way upward through the higher offices in the routine order . In those times the surest avenue to political power was success in military command @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appointed governor of " Farther Spain . " On his arrival he found his province at peace ; but he managed to stir up trouble with some neighboring tribes of mountaineers who were beyond the border of the empire . After imposing upon them orders that they could not obey , he made war upon them . They had little wealth to plunder , but he took captive great numbers , whom he sold into slavery . As governor he found other ways of making money , mostly illegal ; so that he was able to reward his soldiers , pay his huge debts , and have something left for the future . In this policy he acted like former governors , but with greater cleverness .  | Returning to Rome , he gained the Consulship , which was the highest standing office ( S9 B. C. ) There were two consuls ; and his colleague was Bibulus , a stupid person , who chanced to be a political adversary . For the first time Caeser was in a position to display his statesmanship . Two great problems were pressing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their protection from the greedy oppression of Roman officials . Against the obstruction of his colleague Caeser carried a law through the Assembly for the division of large tracts of public land among the needier citizens ? a measure which brought him great popularity . Although it did nothing to benefit the subjects , it was a step in the right direction . Another law , worked out in great detail , aimed to prevent officers of the empire from committing extortion upon the subjects . Though doubtless well intended , this law proved ineffective because no one in power cared to enforce it . Most of his consular year , however , he devoted to winning influent ' al friends and to securing for himself an opportunity for further military exploits after the expiration of his Consulship . The territory placed under his government for this purpose included especially Cisalpine Gaul ? substantially the Po Basin ? and Narbonensis , a strip of land extending along the southern coast of Gaul , now France . Disturbances beyond his borders gave him a pretext for war , which lasted eight years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conquest of Gaul . In accomplishing this end Caesar employed his most brilliant generalship , including lightning-like movements and daring strategy . When we consider that he had had little experience in warfare , we must regard his achievements as marvellous . The conquest was accompanied by great cruelty to the conquered . On one occasion more than fifty thousand captives were sold into slavery ; on another he beheaded the senators of a conquered community  | and sold all the people as slaves . At another time he massacred an entire tribe , numbering more than four hundred thousand men , women , and children . The plunder , and especially the sale of captives , brought the victor enormous wealth , a part of which he devoted to buying supporters at Rome . After overawing Gaul with terrorism he adopted a policy of conciliation , by which he won the fidelity of the survivors . Although in entering upon the conquest Caesar had merely his own aggrandizement in mind , he must in the end have come to an appreciation of the value of the new province to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bravest Gauls , the survivors were full of vitality . The country was rich in agricultural and mineral resources , and the Rhone River formed a convenient outlet for the country 's products in the direction of Rome . This acquisition added great strength to the empire , and prepared the ground for the extension of Roman civilization into western and central Europe . The conquest was , in fact , the greatest achievement of Caesar 's genius . No sooner had he finished this work than he came to blows with the Senate , which feared his towering ambition . A civil war ensued ( 49-45 B.C .. ) The champion of the Senate was Pompey , who also had met with great success in war . Though in appearance the struggle was between Caesar and the Republic , its real object was to determine which of the two leading generals should be master of the Roman world . Pompey was defeated and killed ; and in the end Caesar subdued the whole empire to his will . He ruled as Dictator , appointed to that office by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civil war and the year following its close Cesar gave attention to internal reforms . Humanely and prudently he forgave political offenders , and associated with himself in the government many who had fought against him in the war . He sought to reconcile old hatreds and to introduce an era of good feeling . There can be no doubt of his sympathy with the subject peoples . Those in authority in the provinces were no longer to enrich themselves and their  | friends by oppression , but were held strictly accountable to the Dictator . Roman citizenship was a highly-prized possession , as it meant justice and an enviable social standing to the possessor . Caesar granted it freely to individuals and to entire communities . Obviously , his aim was the rapid equalization of all freemen of the empire . He took especial interest in public improvements at Rome . Among these works was the completion of the temple to Jupiter , Juno , and Minerva on the Capitoline Hill . The earlier temple had been destroyed by fire , and the construction of the new building required about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temple in the city . Caesar laid out a public square , named after his family the Julian Forum , in which he erected a temple to Venus Genetrix ( ancestress ) , from whom he claimed descent . In it he placed a graceful statue of the goddess , carved by Arcesilaus , the most famous sculptor of the age . It is a remarkable example of clinging transparent drapery . In this public exhibition of his descent from a goddess Caeser boldly displayed his egotism , which was further exalted by decrees of the Senate proclaiming him a god . It was not till after his death , however , that a temple was actually erected , at the east end of the Roman Forum , for his worship . The Curia , Senate House , Caesar began to rebuild , but its completion was left to Augustus , who named it the Curia Julia , after the Julian family , to which Csar , and by adoption Augustus , belonged . On the south side of the Forum he began the construction of the Basilica Julia , afterward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for judicial and mercantile business . These are but a small part of the vast improvements that he planned for Rome , Italy , and the empire . The greater number remained mere schemes . To us the most interesting was the cutting of a canal through the Isthmus of Corinth , a work that has had to await the skill of the modern engineer . As supreme pontiff Caesar was the head of the state religion and guardian of the sacred lore . In  | this capacity he reformed the calendar , which in his day had fallen into dire confusion . The improvement consisted essentially in the adoption of the Egyptian solar year of 365 1/4 days . The Julian calendar remained in force throughout the civilized world till 1582 , when it was superseded by that of Pope Gregory XIII , who introduced a more exact system . Personal Appearance , Friends and Character The Romans as a people belonged to the Mediterranean race , and the great majority , therefore , were short and dark , like the Sicilians of today . Caesar , however , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black piercing eyes . His portraits on coins and in sculpture show a spare face with a high , broad forehead inclined to baldness , representing a physique too delicate to sustain the enormous activities of his brain . To the end of his days he paid , perhaps , an excessive attention to his personal appearance , and was especially gratified when the Senate in his honor decreed him the privilege of wearing a laurel wreath ; for he found it a means of covering his baldness . There was it his face and manner a frank sympathy that won the hearts of all those that came into close touch with him ; and in spite of brutal conquest he developed an expression of gentleness and clemency mentioned by writers of his age . The greatest of his contemporaries was Cicero , who by sheer energy and ability had worked his way to the highest offices , and had rescued the state from a dangerous conspiracy . Thought he was a consummate political orator , Cicero ' tastes lay chiefly in the direction of literary and philosophic composition , pleasant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to win him as a political ally but Cicero and those intimate associates that loved the Republic feared Caesar 's autocrat ' methods and ambition . This aloofness d the intellectual class drove Cesar to seek friends and helpers in the lower ranks of society and among his subordinate military officerAlthough a few of these people served hire faithfully , the great majority were incompetent to fill the offices that he gave them , and  | were bent only on shirking duty and enriching themselves . On such a basis no man , however great , can build up a just and efficient system of government . In spite of many admirable qualities Caesar shared fully in the moral looseness of the age , which set at naught all marriage relations . Not even his friends at Rome , nor friendly kings who gave him their hospitality , could trust their wives to his honor . With Cleopatra , queen of Egypt , be had associated in her capital ; but he shocked even his dissolute countrymen by bringing her to Rome and into his own house . An Imitation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own enjoyment but in the conviction that with it he could best serve the empire , can hardly be disputed ; but whether or not he wished the kingly title no one can know . While he was in the Orient the glamor of Alexander 's achievements seems to have overcome him ; and under this spell he neglected the work of improving the empire to plan the conquest of the great Parthian kingdom , Rome 's only surviving rival . In this scheme the conqueror got the better of the statesman . A motive to the new war , in itself unnecessary , was to escape from the situation at Rome ? from flattery , intrigue , the incompetence of officials , from deadly though silent envy and hatred , which were making his life every day more unendurable . As the conqueror of Parthia he could overwhelm all opposition and mold the empire as clay in the potter 's hands . For the remainder of his days he could dwell serene on the pinnacle of glory ; and at his death . having no son of  | his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandnephew Octavius , a youth of great promise whom he had adopted as a son . From all that we can learn , however , success in the Parthian war would have been a catastrophe to European civilization . In wealth and population , in the resources of war and peace , the Oriental part of the empire would have overbalanced the European . The capital would have shifted to Alexandria or farther east ; and Oriental absolutism would have dominated the civilized world . Three centuries after Caesar , autocracy was to come even to Europe . It came with its bureaucratic accompaniment to destroy the little that remained of economic strength and intellectual freedom , and to drag to ruin the decaying civilization of the ancient world . Caesar , however , was not destined even to set out for Parthia . On March 15 ( 44 B. C. ) , the Senate met to take the last measures preparatory to his departure . The place of session was the Senate House which Pornpey had built near his theater . Scarcely had Caesar entered and taken his seat when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretending to greet him and to offer a petition . They were conspirators who had engaged in a plot for his assassination , through no especial love for the Republic , but for various personal reasons . Many had gained office and wealth under his patronage ; but in their greed for greater wealth and political glory they lost all sense of gratitude . The best among them was Marcus Brutus , in his own social circle a philosopher and an idealist , but in business a hard , relentless usurer . Caius Cassius , the brain of the conspiracy , was a plunderer of the provinces and a robber of temples , whom envy drove into the plot . By such men was Caesar slain . It was a crime perpetrated upon the civilized world , which had to endure thirteen more years of desolating civil war ( 44-31 B. C. ) , before Octavius , the young heir to Caesar , could gain the mastery and bring the empire to peace .  | This young man , known to history as Augustus , though less brilliant than his granduncle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was he , rather than Caesar , who gave the Roman world an organization under which it was to enjoy more than two centuries of prosperity and happiness . Viewed in this light , the wisest act of the great Cesar was the choice of this youth of delicately modeled features and frail body as his son and successor .  |
