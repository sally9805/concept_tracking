A COMFORTABLE sitting-room is disclosed . A door in back opens on a hallway with the stairs leading to the floor below just visible . Another door at the right opens on MRS . OWEN 'S bedroom . A window is at the left near the fireplace with its blazing logs . By this is a large easy-chair close to a table which contains a lighted lamp and some books and magazines . The sofa beyond this , the heavy rugs , the soft curtains , the dull lambrequin on the mantel , supporting the inevitable clock , and the well-worn chairs , all seem to have become part of a room which has gained a homey atmosphere with the years . MRS . OWEN is seated , intently reading a popular novel . The clock strikes the half-hour and she looks up , apparently surprised at the time . She puts down the book after placing a silver paper-cutter in the leaves to mark her place . Then she rises , stares at the fire thoughtfully , as though fascinated by its cheerful flame . MRS . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that her repose is not innate , but has been acquired through long schooling : her face , too , in spite of its calm beauty , seems to reflect the quiet that has followed a storm . She is dressed in a loose gown which enhances her natural dignity . As she is standing there , IDA , her daughter , enters unobserved and halts in the doorway , irresolutely looking at her mother . IDA LAWSON is about thirty ; calm , too , like her mother ; though one feels it is but the temporary bit upon a nervous , restless spirit . She has a pleasing personality not without obvious physical charm . She is dressed in street clothes with hat and furs . After a pause she throws the furs aside . MRS . OWEN , hearing her , turns in surprise . IDA LAWSON Mother . p. 3 ELIZABETH Why , daughter ! IDA LAWSON I 'm glad you are here . ELIZABETH ( As they kiss ) We seldom go out now . I was just going to bed . IDA LAWSON Was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ELIZABETH Yes , he 's reading , as usual . He likes a cold room , you know . Did n't you stop ? IDA LAWSON No ; I came right up . ( Trying to appear casual ) What 's he reading ? ELIZABETH How should I know ? ( Seeing IDA take off her hat ) Anything the matter ? IDA LAWSON I 've come to spend the night with you . ELIZABETH Oh , that 's nice . It 's never been the same here these six years since you and Curtis were married . Is he well ? IDA LAWSON Yes . ELIZABETH I 've been reading that novel he loaned me . ( Showing it to her . ) He said it was very interesting . IDA LAWSON It bored me to death . ( There is a pause. ) p. 4 ELIZABETH Has Curtis gone away on business ? IDA LAWSON No . ELIZABETH ( Surprised ) But if your husband 's home  --   --  ? IDA LAWSON ( Evasively ) I thought I 'd like a change . ELIZABETH I 'll tell Frances to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she took up my bag . ELIZABETH How I hated to have you leave that old room of yours . Nothing 's been changed since the day of your marriage . IDA LAWSON I was full of wonder then . It will seem strange sleeping there again  --  with what I know now . ELIZABETH ( Intuitively ) Is anything the matter ? IDA LAWSON No . ( Crossing to the fire . ) My hands are cold . ELIZABETH And little Helen ? IDA LAWSON I left her asleep . ELIZABETH Is she quite well again ? IDA LAWSON Yes , her cough is all gone . p. 5 ELIZABETH You were so susceptible to colds , too . You must tell her nurse to be more careful these damp days . IDA LAWSON ( Thoughtfully ) Helen is like me in many ways , is n't she ? ELIZABETH Yes : but I would n't worry . IDA LAWSON Were you like your mother ? ELIZABETH What a funny question . IDA LAWSON ( Curiously ) But were you ? ELIZABETH I 'm afraid not : your grandmother was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to say . IDA LAWSON ( Absently ) What a circle life is . ELIZABETH ( Gently ) But you did n't come this time of night to talk of circles , did you ? IDA LAWSON No . ELIZABETH Then there is something the matter . IDA LAWSON I 'll tell you to-morrow . ELIZABETH Why not now ? IDA LAWSON ( Trying to dismiss it ) You 're tired and it 's late . p. 6 ELIZABETH ( Pleading quietly ) We have had so few talks together , Ida . IDA LAWSON But it 's  --  it 's always , somehow , been so hard to tell you things . ELIZABETH ( Hurt ) Hard to tell your own mother ? IDA LAWSON It may be naturally hard for me to confide in anybody . ELIZABETH Perhaps , then , I 'd better call your father . IDA LAWSON ( In spite of herself ) He always freezes me so . ELIZABETH Ida ! IDA LAWSON Just leave me alone to-night . ELIZABETH I know you do n't mean to be unkind . IDA LAWSON Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head ) I ca n't make you out ; it worries me ; for who should know you better than your mother . ( IDA turns away . ) Your father and I both love you so . You 've always been everything to us  --  our only child . You know what it is to have an only child , too . ( IDA looks at her in question as MRS . OWEN goes to her . ) If little Helen were troubled , would you want her to go to anybody but you ? And if she did n't  --   --  ? p. 7 IDA LAWSON ( Uncomfortably ) Do n't , mother . ELIZABETH Perhaps you 'd better go to bed . I know you 've been worried about Helen 's cold , but  --  tell me in the morning if you wish . Good-night , dear . IDA LAWSON I ca n't sleep now . ( There is a pause . Then she speaks abruptly . ) Mother , I 've left Curtis . ELIZABETH ( Startled ) Left your husband ? No , that 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Things are finished in this world . ELIZABETH Nothing ever is  --  nothing . IDA LAWSON ( Firmly ) This is . ELIZABETH ( Starts to protest and then halts ) That tone of yours makes me shiver . It was the way your grandmother had at times . I heard it in your voice once before : the night you told us you were going to be married . IDA LAWSON When you and father tried to argue me out of it . You did n't want to be left alone here . I remember how determined I felt then , too . Now I 've left Curtis . And I 've come back to you . Is n't it all funny ? p. 8 ELIZABETH But  --   --  IDA LAWSON ( Interrupting ) It 's no use , mother . It wo n't be as hard as you think . Making up my mind is what has worn me out . Now I 've got hold of myself . I see what I must do . I 'm going to use my brain for once straight through . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fool of me . ELIZABETH Dear , you said yourself you were tired . You ca n't see clearly . You 're not yourself . IDA LAWSON Then who am I ? ( MRS . OWEN looks at her and shakes her head sadly as JOHN OWEN enters softly . OWEN is in the early sixties , super-refined , rather precise in enunciation , and he suggests in both manner and appearance a certain coldness of exterior . He is entirely devoid of discernible emotion . He has on eye-glasses attached to a black cord , and wears a smoking-jacket , though he has not taken off his collar or made himself otherwise comfortable . ) PROFESSOR JOHN OWEN Frances informed me you were here , daughter . Why did n't you come in and see me ? IDA LAWSON ( Somewhat restrained as they kiss ) You never like to be disturbed when you are reading . p. 9 PROFESSOR JOHN OWEN ( Rather didactically ) Bergson bores me anyway : he is trying to undermine intellect with his emphasis on intuition . There is nothing logical about intuition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's a purely feminine endowment ; a defense against man 's muscularity ; but , on the whole  --   --  ELIZABETH ( Interrupting , to his obvious displeasure ) Ida 's come to spend the night . PROFESSOR JOHN OWEN Indeed ? IDA LAWSON I suppose you also want to know the reason . You 'll have to know later , anyway . ELIZABETH ( Nervously ) To-morrow , Ida : your father is tired . PROFESSOR JOHN OWEN ( Irritably to MRS . OWEN ) I am still capable of expressing my own sensations , Elizabeth . IDA LAWSON ( Half to herself ) And here is where I grew up ! ELIZABETH She and Curtis have  --  Oh , it is n't true ! IDA LAWSON I 'm not going to live with Curtis any more . I 've left him . PROFESSOR JOHN OWEN ( Takes off his glasses and motions with them throughout as he looks at her in growing astonishment ) Left your husband ? p. 10 ELIZABETH I ca n't believe it , either . IDA LAWSON Father , I know my own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty ; I 'm married ; I 'm a mother . I 've left my husband for good . I 'll never live with him again , never . PROFESSOR JOHN OWEN There 's no need to get excited . IDA LAWSON I want you to see quite clearly I mean what I say . PROFESSOR JOHN OWEN ( After a pause ) I ca n't believe it . Left your husband ? What 's the trouble ? ( With a logical air as though it were a theorem . ) Sit down and let me have the facts : then we can discuss the matter clearly . IDA LAWSON ( With a touch of emotion ) Oh , why did n't you simply take me in your arms ? ELIZABETH ( To OWEN ) Do n't be unkind to her . This has upset her . PROFESSOR JOHN OWEN ( With some asperity ) These women ! I do n't mean to be unkind , Elizabeth . I understand her feelings . But somebody must keep his head . You women fly off so . I can not give her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't come for advice . p. 11 PROFESSOR JOHN OWEN Then , why did you come ? IDA LAWSON I had to go somewhere , did n't I ? ELIZABETH ( Comforting her ) You did quite right to come to those who can help . IDA LAWSON ( With a catch in her voice ) I do n't want help ! PROFESSOR JOHN OWEN ( With a quiet persistence ) But misunderstandings happen in the best marriages . They can generally be straightened out if people will only talk them over . IDA LAWSON Talk , talk ! Curtis and I have talked for months . I 'm sick to death of talk . I just want to draw myself under a cover and sleep . Oh , to sleep in the dark ! ( IDA has covered her face with her hands . There is a pause as the others seem at a loss , though OWEN is a trifle impatient . OWEN finally goes to her . ) ELIZABETH Ca n't you let your father help you ? PROFESSOR JOHN OWEN ( With reserve ) If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IDA LAWSON ( In a matter-of-fact tone ) What do you wish to know ? p. 12 PROFESSOR JOHN OWEN You might take a less impersonal tone , daughter . I do n't wish to probe . ELIZABETH ( Trying to soothe the situation ) Do n't make it difficult for your father , dear . You know how he hates to show his feelings . IDA LAWSON Since I 've come back to you I suppose it 's not quite square to be silent . ELIZABETH ( Relieved ) She 'll tell you now , John . PROFESSOR JOHN OWEN Is it more than a misunderstanding ? IDA LAWSON It 's everything . I was n't a foolish romantic girl when we married . I did n't expect too much . But he and I ca n't even be friends . ELIZABETH ( Quickly ) There is somebody else ? IDA LAWSON That 's what everybody thinks nowadays when a marriage goes wrong . ELIZABETH ( Enigmatically ) One generally realizes then . ( IDA eyes her with an intuitive flash of understanding . ) PROFESSOR JOHN OWEN Are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ? I 'm no longer proud . The law would say he was guilty . p. 13 ELIZABETH Oh , the shame ! IDA LAWSON ( Quickly ) But I 'm not sure the fault is his . The law does n't seem to consider temperaments , does it ? We 're all in one mold . Perhaps I 'm to blame . Who knows ? ELIZABETH ( Shocked ) Our daughter to blame ? PROFESSOR JOHN OWEN What are you saying ? IDA LAWSON What few of us who get the divorces are willing to acknowledge : our part in the guilt . PROFESSOR JOHN OWEN ( More seriously ) You 're thinking of getting a divorce ? IDA LAWSON ( With determination ) Yes ; it 's fairer to him . ELIZABETH Oh , Ida , perhaps it may not have to be that : it 's so awful . IDA LAWSON I know how unpleasant notoriety is to our family . That 's the penalty of father 's importance . I thought the fact that Curtis had other women would be enough to make you accept it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PROFESSOR JOHN OWEN Are you quite sure you have thought over what a divorce would mean ? p. 14 IDA LAWSON I never thought of it till it became my personal question . If that 's what you have in mind . PROFESSOR JOHN OWEN ( Shaking his head ) But it 's not your question alone . That 's my point . Society  --   --  IDA LAWSON ( Sharply ) Father , I ca n't be sociological . ELIZABETH Then , what about Helen ? IDA LAWSON ( Calmly ) I shall send for her to-morrow . ELIZABETH ( Alarmed ) You are going to separate her from Curtis ? PROFESSOR JOHN OWEN Do n't be foolish , Elizabeth ; if Ida has determined on a divorce and her husband has been guilty with other women  --   --  IDA LAWSON ( Quickly ) I would n't resort to such a trick . PROFESSOR JOHN OWEN Trick ? IDA LAWSON ( Scornfully ) Do you feel that Helen is mine , just because my husband happened to break the law , the ridiculous law which declares he ca n't be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15 ELIZABETH ( Shocked ) Episodes ? Is that what you call them ? IDA LAWSON What else can I call them , when I see they have n't changed or influenced his life one bit ? Surely you know , father , how unimportant such experiences often may be to a man like Curtis . PROFESSOR JOHN OWEN ( Fundamentally offended ) I know nothing of the sort ! You ought to be ashamed to make such remarks before your mother . If you do n't think his episodes mean anything , why are you denying him his right to Helen ? IDA LAWSON Because Helen belongs to me , not to him . I carried her alone . He went away during most of my time . My condition offended him . She 's mine because Curtis did n't sit by my side when Helen was born ; because he did n't suffer through seeing me suffer . All he was willing to give to parenthood was a man 's momentary pleasure : I gave pain  --  such long pain . Why , during all those months he never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Shocked ) What do you know of a man 's feelings at such a time ? IDA LAWSON I 'd like to know about other men . ( She goes impulsively to MRS . OWEN . ) Mother , when I was born , did father  --   --  ? ( MRS . OWEN is startled . ) Never mind , do n't answer . How foolish of me ! I might have known . We 're wasting time talking  --  talking . How I hate words ! ( She turns towards the fire again , half absorbed. ) p. 16 ELIZABETH Do n't reproach your father , Ida ; he  --  he was very good to me when I really did n't deserve it . PROFESSOR JOHN OWEN ( Quietly ) Elizabeth , that 's not to the point . ELIZABETH ( With a certain strength ) It is . Ida thinks because a thing is new that it is right ; that you and I have foolish ideas on marriage and divorce . She does n't know how we  --   --  PROFESSOR JOHN OWEN ( Stopping her ) Elizabeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mother ; what do you both want me to do ? What are you both arguing with me this way for ? Do you think it easy for me to acknowledge failure , to take up a new life , alone , when I 'm not prepared for it ? Oh , why is it we three ca n't talk together without cutting ourselves with every word ? I know it 's difficult for you to have me submitted to all that must follow : the talk , the stripping of my private affairs before a court which has no right to know , the newspapers , the headlines , the story played up out of all proportion to its worth . I 've thought of all that ; but it seems so unimportant now . ( Going to her . ) Does it hurt you so much to have me leave Curtis , when you see he and I have n't a single thing in common ? p. 17 ELIZABETH You have Helen ! PROFESSOR JOHN OWEN Yes : have you forgotten your daughter ? ELIZABETH ( Taking her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you say , I think divorce is terrible when there is a little child depending on you both . IDA LAWSON ( She looks at the two and then slowly sits down as though stunned ) Strange ! That 's why I thought it terrible to stay . You 're shocked because I felt Curtis ' episodes meant nothing ; yet , in spite of your feeling about them , you still ask me to stay with him for Helen 's sake ! PROFESSOR JOHN OWEN ( Uncomfortably ) Yes , for the sake of your child . IDA LAWSON Is that a man 's point of view ? ELIZABETH It is mine , too , Ida . IDA LAWSON You feel as strongly as that ! ELIZABETH ( Thinking IDA is weakening ) What 's to prevent your making another try together ? PROFESSOR JOHN OWEN Wait a while , anyway . Do n't be hasty . Take the time to consider . Stay here with us a bit and  --   --  p. 18 ELIZABETH ( Pleading ) Your father 's right : we 're older ; we 've lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps in time  --   --  IDA LAWSON ( With pointed abruptness ) Mother , have you asked yourself why Curtis went outside ? Why I could n't hold him ? Why I did not want to hold him ? ELIZABETH Ida ! IDA LAWSON It is because  --  because we both made a terrible mistake  --  totally misread ourselves . I do not love Curtis . I see I never have loved him . PROFESSOR JOHN OWEN Never loved him ? Then , why did you marry him ? IDA LAWSON ( Enigmatically ) Some day I may tell you . I did n't understand then . I do now . ELIZABETH Why , you would n't even listen to us when we tried to dissuade you against  --   --  IDA LAWSON That , too , I did n't understand at the time . ( Slowly ) I must be careful not to make another mistake . PROFESSOR JOHN OWEN Mistake to keep a home for your child with her father ? ELIZABETH ( Poignantly ) You think that a mistake ? p. 19 IDA LAWSON ( With a certain desperation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How can I give the child a home when Curtis and I do not love each other ? Did n't you ever think of it in that way ? I have . That 's the real reason I 'm leaving . I ca n't give her a real home with Curtis ! I do n't want the child to grow up in just a place . She deserves something more than that . She 'd be stifled . She could n't be free . She 'd be pressed down by our unhappiness . She 'd detect our restlessness . She 'd not have the peace her childhood has the right to ask . Curtis and I would differ on everything about her as we 'd differ on everything else . We have already . That 's what suddenly frightened me after desperately clinging for so many months . I felt the child was being hurt , that she was beginning to see our unhappiness . I could n't stand that . Why , she asked me something to-night before she went to sleep that I had to lie about . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I must leave before it was too late . I ca n't see her joy frozen again by the looks Curtis and I gave each other  --  looks that made her ask the question . Somehow I felt her whole life might be shaped by those looks . I ca n't let my little child run that risk . I ca n't and I wo n't . PROFESSOR JOHN OWEN ( Who has been trying to get a word in ) And do you think you alone are capable of supplying what a father has to give ? p. 20 IDA LAWSON I 'm thinking that one parent who loves her will be better for Helen than two in the same house who do not love each other ! ELIZABETH ( Deeply moved ) What is she saying ? PROFESSOR JOHN OWEN ( Same ) She does n't know . ELIZABETH Oh ! IDA LAWSON And then afterwards when Helen grows up and Curtis and I are weary , and begin more and more to drop the mask before her , and she sees and understands fully and perhaps loves us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to offer her that problem ? To ask her love to stretch over our severed lives , to let her feel she tied us together ? No , no ! She 'd end by silently reproaching us because we did n't respect her right for love in her home . And all the time , Curtis and I would be desperately trying to keep her near us  --  because we would be afraid of what would happen to each other when the link was broken . And then one day , maybe , something would snap within her , and she 'd go  --  to what ? Oh , how I 'd tremble for her if I felt she married to escape her home ! ELIZABETH ( Poignantly ) So that was why you married Curtis ! IDA LAWSON ( Seeing what she has inadvertently let slip ) No . No. p. 21 ELIZABETH It is  --  it is ! IDA LAWSON No ! ELIZABETH Oh ! IDA LAWSON ( Realizing the situation ) Well , then : yes , mother : that was why I married Curtis ! PROFESSOR JOHN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) IDA LAWSON I did n't know at the time but I see it now . I never meant to tell you . I did n't mean to hurt you . But now you know why I am leaving my husband . I  --  I could n't stand the thought of having my life with him as  --  as yours has been here . ELIZABETH ( Defensively ) Our life ? IDA LAWSON Oh , I know now what it has been all these years . And I could n't sit face to face alone with my husband , going on , as you and father have , through the momentum of habit but without love . PROFESSOR JOHN OWEN How dare you say this ! IDA LAWSON Is n't it true ? Did n't I live here ? Did n't I see it all without understanding it ? Did n't I feel it ? ( They are silent . ) Oh , I could n't go on with Curtis  --  frozen  --  eyeing each other in the silences : he with the consciousness I had forgiven him , eating at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tricking myself with the magnanimity I had displayed in forgiving him and not wishing to lessen the beauty of my sacrifice . That sha' n't be my marriage . Helen sha' n't grow up there . No . No . ( There is a silence . OWEN has stared at her tense and silent . MRS . OWEN has been cut by each word and finally sobs , as her husband goes to her. ) p. 22 ELIZABETH That my daughter could say this to us  --  after all we have done for her ! PROFESSOR JOHN OWEN Sh ! ( With a cold restraint throughout . ) You 'd better go to your room now , Ida . IDA LAWSON ( Diffidently ) I had to let you see how I felt . You forced it out of me . Helen means everything to me . I am doing what I think is best . PROFESSOR JOHN OWEN ( Restrained ) That is all one can do . Good-night . IDA LAWSON I have no place to go . You 'll let me stay here for a little while  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You are quite sure you will be comfortable here with your mother and me ? IDA LAWSON I sha' n't be in the way , shall I ? ELIZABETH No , no . You 've cut me to the quick . But all we have is yours . Our whole life together has been for you . ( OWEN gazes into the fire with his back turned to them . ) IDA LAWSON Mother , do n't cry . ( She kneels beside MRS . OWEN with a burst of feeling . ) Oh , mother , mother . p. 23 ELIZABETH ( Gathering her in her arms . ) My child . IDA LAWSON ( After a long silence ) Oh , mother , if we could only be close . ELIZABETH How could we be when you think I 've done you a great wrong ? IDA LAWSON Oh , ca n't we try ? We need each other more than ever now . ELIZABETH I 've always needed you . IDA LAWSON We 're both alone now . ELIZABETH Do n't hurt your father : it 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . IDA LAWSON Father , will you forgive me ? PROFESSOR JOHN OWEN ( Without turning ) I suppose one must forgive even the truth at times . IDA LAWSON Why must you and mother always be so far apart ? ELIZABETH Hush , child . IDA LAWSON ( Looking slowly from one to the other ) If it had brought you two together , all the sacrifice for me might have been worth it . ELIZABETH We did what we thought was best for you . We never expected you would reproach us. p. 24 IDA LAWSON ( Bowing her head ) Mother , I 've said I was sorry that it slipped out . Ca n't you ever forgive me ? ELIZABETH ( Tenderly ) Oh , yes ; because you may have to face the same thing yourself some day . IDA LAWSON The same thing ? ELIZABETH Yes : the reproaches of your child . IDA LAWSON ( Startled ) Helen ? ELIZABETH Yes . IDA LAWSON ( As she sees OWEN turn and eye her ) Oh , no ! No ! ! ELIZABETH ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you for leaving her father as you have reproached me for staying ? IDA LAWSON No , no : that could n't be ! PROFESSOR JOHN OWEN How do you know ? IDA LAWSON ( She looks toward him a second and then at her mother ) That would be terrible . Terrible ! ! ELIZABETH Yes ; terrible if she judges you as you have us. p. 25 IDA LAWSON ( Losing complete control of herself ) Oh , mother , I 'm miserable . Now I see what I have said to you . Now I know how I hurt you . Forgive me  --  forgive me . ( Sobbing . ) I was so sure I was right so sure . If she should say such things to me I could n't stand it . I love her so . Oh , now I shall always fear her reproaches when she grows up . ELIZABETH ( Comforting her and speaking with vision ) A woman never can understand her mother till she has a child of her own . ( There is a long pause . ) Come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep . Come . I 'll go to your old room with you . ( She urges IDA to rise . ) Come . ( She puts her arm about IDA and leads her toward the door . ) Do n't cry , child . You 'll be sick . Hush , dear , for my sake . ( MRS . OWEN and IDA go out in back so close in each other 's thoughts that they seem to have forgotten OWEN who has stood almost impersonally watching them . As the door closes after them he smiles cynically . ) PROFESSOR JOHN OWEN Huh ! These women ! ( He stands there with his hands behind his back , warming them before the fire. )
