txt Manhattan 's Real Estate Values . In all the discussion of subways and other transportation facilities in the newspapers I have not recently noticed any reference to the decline in value of Manhattan real estate in the last four years . I own property located east of Third Avenue and north of Fifty-ninth Street that has declined several thousand dollars in value since 1007 . This decline in value was caused by the increase In car fares , the result of curtailing transfers . The Pinkney sale is another bad example of the decline in price of Manhattan real estate , The block between Fifth and Lenox Avenues , 110th and 111th Streets , was sold for $935,750 ; the assessed valuation for 1911 is $1,285,000 , 132 per cent . of price . Will more subways , to be paid for chiefly by Manhattan real estate , cause further decline in value of Manhattan real estate ? REAL ESTATE OWNER .
