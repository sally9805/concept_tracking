txt Unsightly Roof Tanks . Why do architects build palatial apartment houses with gilded lobbilis and swell fronts , often richly covered with stone carvings , and then perch uninclosed and stilted high on the reefs , water tanks , generally painted red or black , that can be seen from almost every direction ? Because they lack the courage and the initiative to do differently from what all the rest have done . Old ideas are accepted as a Matter Of course because things ' have always been done that way . While the building laws and fire laws require an elevation of so many feet above the roofs , why could n't these unsightly roof tanks be put into domes , towers , turrets , effects of Grecian pillared temples , cupolas covered with red tiled roofs , or lattlee work or some treatment that would grow naturally from the plan of the building into the de-sign ? After this became customary we would have a city with a skyline of beautiful domes and towers , instead of factory-like tanks that smite every eye for beauty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggestion ? Other cities might follow after a while .
