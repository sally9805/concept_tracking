txt Nc , one can blame Mr. WILLIAM BARNES , Jr. , for the frankly triumphant tone of his acceptance of the Chairmanship of the Republican State Committee . Least of all can he he blamed for his emphatic and - unmistakable references to the distinguished politician who boasted last Fall that he had the Old Guard " beaten to a frazzle . " Nor can it be denied that the amazing situation created by a majority of the Democrats at Albany the moment they obtained power must give a lot of cheer and confidence to the actual Republican leader . That Mr. BARNES 19 now such a leader in his party In this State is beyond dispute , and Mr. ROOSEVELT does not seem inclined to dispute it . There must be searching of hearts among Mr. ROOSEVELT 'S following when the present state of things is compared with that of a few brief months since . There has not been in recent politizal history a change so marked and significant in the fortunes of a great popular leader . From the day when Mr. RooszVELT started out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perils to which Mr. BARNES and his associates had exposed it to the day when Mr. BARNES is promoted to the headship of the organization there has been for the ex-President an almost uninterrupted series of disappointments , reverses , and humiliations . We should say that the election of Mr. BARNES must seem the crowning one . How has it all come about ? For one thing , Mr. RoosEvELT never really undertook to perform the task he professed to set himself . He did not drive the Old Guard from power ; he only sought to divide it , and by an alliance with one part of it , to seize the machinery of his party . That gave him control of thew State Convention , but it hopelessly handicapped hiln for the campaign of purification he had declared he would wage . As a matter of fact , he abandoned tha't campaign - , tnd all pretense of it . As soon as he had named his candidate for Governor he began to plead for " harmony " with I he very men he had promised to fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposing and uprooting corruption , and concentrated nearly all his attention on National issues , and on his personal relation to those issues . Indeed he made of himself the one National issue . He projected into the canvass his own notions , theories , ambitions , jealousies , suspicions , and stirred up a lot of bad blood in his own party without seriously affecting the position of the opposing party . Worst of all , he wabbled . Not only did he first attack and then court the Old Guard , but he swung from the extreme " New Nationalism " of his early utterances to schemes to placate the standpatters and the " interests . " Meanwhile the Old Guard stood silently and grimly aloof awaiting the result which they rightly believed would follow . Whatever fear they may at first have had for the assailant who sallied out so furiously against them , they had none for the desperate , vociferous , but oscillating and inconsistent agitator whom they saw reeling to defeat . Now they have " come back , " and very naturally they rejoice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have not changed their spots , or got rid of them ; they have not won the confidence their foe has lost , and they will find it hard to win it , even if they try
