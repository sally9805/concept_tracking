Two weeks later , I had got strong enough to go to work . As I did not want to work in the presence of my former employer , I did not return there . One of Clara 's friends , a cutter , took me up to the place where he was employed . It also was a non-union shop . There were quite a number of shops that remained unorganized , the workers refusing to go down , trusting the bosses ' promise to better their conditions without the help of the Union ; like sheep led by wolves , who make them believe that the shepherd deprives them of liberty ; that he does not allow them to run in the spacious fields and gather the best grass for themselves ; that without the shepherd they would enjoy more freedom . The foolish sheep . influenced by the wolves , would run away from the shepherd , only to be eaten by the hungry wolves who had purposely led them away from protection . They perished ? victims of their own stupidity . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boss was obliged to grant all the union conditions , in order to prevent his workers from leaving his place . The system in that shop was very different from that in my first place . Later I learned that each shop has its own system . I felt like a beginner again . The forelady , Yetta , bless her heart , was a kind and gentle person . She gave me all the necessary instructions , so that I got used to the work quickly . Week-work prevailed in the place . I expected to get seven dollars a week to start with ; but how great was my astonishment when in my pay envelope I found ten dollars ! Destiny seemed to play with me . I was so happy that evening when I brought my pay home . Breathlessly , I ran to break the news to Clara , and holding the envelope tight in my hand , told her to guess how much . She could not guess . The highest she could think of was eight ; but when I placed the envelope near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , here ! You are a regular dressmaker already ! ' Why , how dare you think otherwise ? ' I answered in the same tone . It was not the money that made me feel so happy , it was my worth that I thought of . I could not have expected to get ten dollars a week after having only a few weeks ' experience . My former boss , claiming to be a good friend of mine when I made five dollars a week , used to remind me that he did not think that I was worth even that much . Though a friend , he took advantage of a learner , as nearly every other manufacturer does . Now that I was able to make ends meet more easily , my mind was at peace again . I began to think of my home and decided to send for my younger brother , a physically strong-built lad of eighteen . He , I thought , having a good trade , will soon be able to earn money , and both of us will help the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She gave me a loan of fifty dollars , on payments of three dollars a week . The money I sent home for my brother 's ticket . I went en improving in my work from day to day . Very shortly afterwards I was employed in the sample-room to work on samples from time to time , and so I became a sample-maker . Things once more went on smoothly . The strength of youth conquered . My cheerfulness returned . Again I went among my friends , entertaining them with song and infecting them with my joyousness . Even in the shop I felt happy . My neighbors were very kind and gentle , each one helping the other out of difficulties in her work . At lunch-time I was always among the workers ; very few would go out to lunch . Bologna , salorne , corned beef , the Italian 's egg-plant fried in a lot of olive oil ? all spread such a mixed , unpleasant smell over the shop . The few girls at my table would sit together , exchanging food with each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of orange for a banana , a corned-beef sandwich for some whitefish , and many other varieties . I would take part in the conversation , but I never shared in the exchange of food . Their kind offerings to me I refused , for I had nothing to give in return . My lunch consisted of either a cheese sandwich and milk , or an egg and milk . The pint of milk I bought every morning had to be used up , so I had a small bottle and would always bring the rest of the milk for my lunch . No wonder you are so white , living on milk so exclusively , ' they would often tease me . I told them that I liked nothing else , though often their pickles and smoked delicacies would awaken a sharp appetite in me . Their conversation , very different from the vulgarities of the girls in thesweater shop , was much pleasanter . Very little talk about fellers , ' swell evening pumps , lace petticoats that the six dollar wage-earners were constantly discussing , in the sweater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , world-happenings , music , art , literature , and trade questions . One fault I found with them ? their indifference to being members of the Dress-andWaist-Makers ' Union . They would belong , they all agreed , if they worked in a union shop ; but they would not trouble to unionize this shop . Now that I was provided with work again , I had time to think a little of myself . It was a long time that I had not had any kind of recreation . Before , I had not had any money , and then I was too busy to think of it . I longed so much for a good opera or drama , for they were the only places where my mind felt at ease . As food was necessary for my stomach hunger , music and drama were necessary for my mental hunger . Not being able to see or hear of our world 's masterpieces , I had to find satisfaction in reading them . My fantasia would often stage such wonderful sceneries , that when I happened to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel disappointed , for the impersonation on the stage would be much poorer than in my imagination . At that time the Century Opera Company gave operas at popular prices . When I had my last debt paid up to my friend , Clara , I at once went to the Opera House , securing tickets for five dollars at twenty-five cents each , so that I was provided with opera tickets for the next few weeks . I had also secured tickets for the Manhattan Opera Company , where the world 's greatest dancer , Pavlova , danced at that time . For Caruso I paid the highest prices . He would often cost me a few lunches and dinners that I saved from , in order to have enough money ONE OF THEM for a standing ticket . Sometimes I would go right from work , without any dinner , to stand in line for general admission . If it happened to rain , my dress would be soaked through and through , and with wet clothes I would stand through the performance , changing from foot to foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the orchestra . Very often I would pay with a cold the next day . But the magic of the music was so great , that I forgot my cold as soon as it was over , and went again when I had another opportunity . The opera house was the only place where I envied the rich . I did not envy their expensive clothes , nor their many valuable , useless diamonds ; I envied their comfortable chairs , which were reserved for them , standing the most of the time during the performance empty . They would more often come in the second act , and leave the house at the beginning of the last ; some of them would yawn all through the performance . Of course , the greater part of the audience sat listening to the opera with great pleasure . But many sat as if fulfilling a duty in listening to the music . Besides the theatre , I also attended the different lectures about modern literature that I was so fond of . My favorite authors were Ibsen , Strindberg , , Maeterlinck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At home , in Russia , I always had time enough to read . In the small town where I lived , there was no library . There was a small unimportant library in the public school , but only for the scholars , not for the public . With the exception of the cities , where there were good libraries , the government thought it unnecessary to install libraries . Our town was big enough to keep two monopol ( stores of vodka ) , ? that drink being a cause of ruin to the people , ? but not for a library to enlighten the people 's minds . A group of us young girls and boys got together , and with our own money , after a long time of hard struggle , created a small library , hoping to increase it from time to time . Not being able to get a permit from the government , we had to keep it in secret . But the chief of police soon learned of it . He immediately made a visit , searching for forbidden literature . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ library , at that time two hundred roubles ' worth , and the arrest of many of our members . The worst thing of all was , that he sold our books , obtained through such hardship , to his officers , for ten , fifteen cents a book , and we could never get them back . We were left without any literature at all . This was only a part of the many discouraging experiences I had in my native home , Russia . Russia ! How hateful the word sounds to me ! The ignorance in which Russia is keeping her people , the many obstacles she puts in the way of my nation , particularly the limitations of the civil rights for us , the desolation of our lives , and private ownership , that Russia is practicing so often , lights a fire of hate for her in our hearts , that burns for a lifetime . When our library was destroyed , we began to think or some other way of getting literature , for we could not get along without it . Many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very good classics as premiums in addition to the magazine . Some subscribed for the monthly magazine , The Modern World , in which many of the modern writers participated . A few of us had friends in the city , who supplied them with books through the mail . We would mostly read and discuss together . That helped us in widening our ideas and understanding of what we read . If any one happened to visit the city , he or she would attend as many lectures as possible ; also the theatre ; and they would come home with a supply of impressions , ? with the criticism of the lectures and performances , ? and share it with the rest , who sat at home waiting impatiently for literary , dramatical , and musical news . Hard as it was for us to get what we wanted , still we succeeded in reading all the best classics , Russian and foreign as well , also a great deal of the modern literature . Our teachers , t who mostly came from the city , would be astonished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a matter of fact , we , who met with such hardship in getting literature , knew much more than most of the city students , who had the privilege of the best libraries . Since I left home , I have done very ' little reading . The struggle for my existence , the worry about work , the trouble in the shops which I passed through , occupied my mind and time . Now that I was more or less economically better off , I gave myself up entirely to reading . I often visited the Public Library . I was not used to get everything as easily as I could get it in the New York Library , and it made me feel happy . If there is anything to pay this city credit for , that is her libraries and museums of art and history . Two evenings in the week I went to the Opera , the rest of the evenings I spent either in attending lectures , or reading , or at union meetings . But that did not satisfy me . I realized that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I also realized that the shop was no place for me . The shop as it is under the present system is good for no human being to work in , for it does not comply with the human necessities . It is not only the experience of my own trade I speak of . I come in contact with people who work at all kinds of trades , and each one 's life is worse than the other 's . I saw no future for me sitting in the shop . It is Impossible to lead a decent , comfortable living , such as a human being is entitled to , for the earnings they get at the present time . In order to get some better kind of a profession , I had to study English . But how was I to do it ? After work , I felt too tired to study . I made several attempts to do it , but had to stop it as soon as I began , for I was not strong enough to stand a day 's work and an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the theatre ? to the last bench of the family circle , so high that the people on the stage looked like dwarfs . Here we sat silently waiting for the music to start . My friend Clara made several attempts to raise a conversation , but I tried to avoid it ; it was hard for me to talk . I was tired of telling her the same old stories over and over . She more or less made peace with her surroundings ; economically she was much better off ; as an expert dressmaker she worked in a steady private establishment , for a decent salary . Besides the work , she found satisfaction in belonging to different clubs , while I got tired of those clubs . They were too dry for me . Her spiritual development was on a much smaller scale than mine , and she would easily be inspired by things that did not interest me at all . My temper was a more revolutionary one , and I was more sensitive . You must learn to take things easy , ' she would say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people not take life so easy , we would have a much better world than such as we have now , ' were my arguments to her . At last the music started . I was all transformed into attention . I bathed my soul in the wonderful sounds of the music , trying to wash off the heavy melancholy that possessed me , and kept on gnawing , gnawing my heart and soul . Who has once heard that opera surely remembers the sweet music and beautiful words of the aria from the third act in Tosca : and so on . I felt a thousand angels dancing around me when the world 's greatest artist , Caruso , began the aria in his wonderful voice . How I wished it would never end ! How I dreaded to be brought back to thoughts of my present miserable life ! On our way home , I was very silent . I thought of the successful artists whose early life I read about ; who knows ? perhaps if I would once have a chance to show my abilities ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught myself on that daring thought . But I am very emotional . Many people at home in Russia would advise me to select a stage career ; myself , I had the highest wish to become an actress , but my parents would not listen to it ? they had the worst opinion of an actress ; they saw no art in it . Being in New York , I often thought of it , but I was afraid to try , for I knew nobody who could give me an introduction to the stage , and I , not knowing the English language , could not succeed in trying all alone without anybody 's help . ' I am growing impatient to walk with you all the way home so quietly ; say something : how did you like the opera ? ' My friend Clara was used to have me share my inspirations with her as soon as we walked out of the Opera House ; sometimes she would walk with me for hours , listening to my conversation about music , drama , and art in general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pessimistical. 11 Although the conditions in my shop were just as good as in the best union shops , and we had everything except the recognition of the Union , still , I was anxious to have it organized . I confess , it was puzzling to me , at first , why the boss objected to his people joining the Union . As long as union conditions prevailed in the shop , why not allow the workers to belong where they would ? Some of the members in the shop were union members . On my question , why they did not have the shop organized , they would answer me carelessly , ' We should worry so long as we have union conditions . ' I suffered by their ignorant answers . I recalled the thousands of young girls who had so bitterly fought their fight only a few weeks before , and I argued with my co-workers . Do n't you know that we have got everything just because so many thousands of girls fought for it ? You yourselves stated that the standards were much lower here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increases when the girls in the other shops won them . Do you think that our boss , no matter how kind he is , would reduce four hours a week , if it were not for the strike ? We workers must all do our share . It is not fair to stay aside and let others fight and spend their money to keep up an or- ganization when we all get the good benefits from it . There must be reasons why the boss does not want a union shop . I am not criticizing our boss , I admit that he is a fair man ; but do n't you know that for the desire of making more money , the bosses , even the best of them , will exploit their workers to the utmost . That is why we must be organized , so that we can stand up against them . In unity is our strength . We must belong to a union , in order to protect ourselves against the ruling hand of capitalism . ' But the workers cared to know next to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me rudely , You better shut up ; if you do n't , you will get fired . There was another girl in the shop and she tried to agitate for the Union and she was discharged . ' I would often talk to Clara about my desire to organize the shop . She also warned me not to do it . ' The dull season is approaching ; you have not any money saved up to face it , so what will you do in case you are fired ? ' But I could not rest . I felt like a criminal , to work in a trade that is organized , and not belong to the ranks . I could not have imagined that there still were so many people who did not understand the value of organization . But I soon found the reason why . As a rule , a worker in a shop brings up his or her friends or relatives ; that friend or relative another friend , and so on ; so that , in most cases , the shop contains workers who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , if one seems to be misinformed about unionism , all of them get the same idea . If one of them is warned by the boss to keep away from union people , mostly all of them obey him . Particularly among Italians , the bringing up of friends is practiced . Realizing that with lack of knowledge of the trade-union movement , I couldhelp very little to make them see my point of view , I decided to report to the Union , hoping that they would send some one to unionize the place . When I went to the office of the Union , I saw the head organizer , and told him about my shoe . He appeared to be interested , and explained that the organizers were only too glad to help out those who wanted to be helped ; that for years they had been trying to enlighten the workers ' minds , to awaken them to self-consciousness and help them organize into a union . Without a union , the bosses drove their workers like slaves , they did not fear the individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be heartlessly thrown out of the shop . But when a protest comes from all the workers , not only from one shop , but from all shops equally , the bosses must listen to them and treat them justly ; if they do not , then the workers strike . It is very sad to admit that there are still workers who do not care how they are treated . Instead of demanding their rights , they keep trying schemes to win the bosses ' favor in order to get a dollar raise . ' He spoke the truth . There are many workers who would do anything , even injure a fellow worker , in order to get a raise . Somehow my boss learned that I had complained to the Union . Any one else in my place would have been fired without explanation ; but I worked for ten dollars a week , and worked mostly on samples , while a samplemaker 's minimum wage was fourteen dollars . That is why the boss first tried to speak to me and warn me . In the morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very gentle woman , always previously welcoming me with a smile , seemed to be angry . Why , Lizzie , I am surprised with you , such a sensible girl as I thought you , to act so silly . ' I guessed what she was at , but said , ' What is the matter ? ' acting as if I knew nothing . ' Tell me , are you dissatisfied with your position ? Is there anything wrong with this place ? ' No , ' I answered , ' I 'm satisfied and I think the place is all right . ' Then what is the sense in going to the damn Union ? ' " ' Damn Union " ! How dare you ? ' wanted to reply , but I controlled myself . Well , ' I said , ' I see no harm in it . ' It is for your sake I warn you . I 'm only a friend to you . Do n't you know that the leaders of the Union only care for your money ; they do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is all they are . ' I smiled again . Poor soul , she was so sure of what she said . In the meantime , the boss came in , called me aside , and with the authority of a professor , he began to lecture me . Look here , little girl , I 'm a man who is fair and square as possible . I always treat my workers as good as I can . Everybody is pleased with their positions ; are not you ? Did I not try to give you all chances for advance-ment ? ' Yes , you did , and it was very nice of you ; but you did not raise me in accordance with my advancement , ' I answered . Oh , you 'll get a raise next season . You do n't expect me to raise you the first season ? But to the point : you have no idea what grafters the leaders are . There has been no strike which has not been sold by them . They get the poor working-people 's money , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am sorry for my own people . Why should they waste their money earned through hard labor ? The Union is only a bluff , there is nothing to it , it is no use for the workers . Now , if you want to be a sensible girl , do your work , do not mix in others ' business . You can stay here , and I 'll raise you a dollar a week when next season begins ; now I ca n't . You see the dull season is coming already . Another week , and there will be very little work to do . ' I thanked him for his kindness and sat clown to work . Now I understood why people in that shop feared the Union . They were fed with the same kind of lectures continually . No wonder they had the idea of Unionism in general , as a place where the workers were cheated . How was I to change their minds ? How was I to explain to them that this was only a trick of the bosses to poison the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other shops , I heard the same story told to the workers by the bosses . In order to learn the accomplishments of our unions in the last strike , I went and joined the Union . In the shops where a high grade of dresses are made , the season often ends at the beginning of April . On the coming Saturday , at one o'clock , the boss informed his workers that , on account of the approaching dull times , he was compelled to reduce their wages two or three dollars a week , demanding however the same full week 's work . What were the workers to do ? Here they were like sheep led away by a wolf from the shepherd . They had listened to the boss when he promised them all they desired , in order to keep them from the Union ; and now , when the busy season was over , he took advantage of the workerswho had no union to protect them , and reduced their wages , being sure that in the dull season they would stay for less . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and left the place : those who remained were too ignorant to realize it . When I came on Monday to work , everything seemed so different . No more the former gentleness ; the foreman was more particular about the work , more exacting in his demands . It was slower , so he had more time to watch everything . Even the nice Yetta was not so gentle , but I knew it was not her fault . She had to obey the instructions of the boss . The first of May was approaching . The Union made all preparations for a grand march . The first of May had two meanings for me . As a schoolteacher at home , I always celebrated that clay by going off to the woods , with my pupils , and merrily spent the clay in songs and games , that celebration having for its sole reason the greeting of the best day of spring . And so sweet were the memories of those bygone days ! The second more important meaning was the ' International Labor Holiday . ' I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to compel me to work . In vain did I try to inspire my co-workers with the significance of the First of May . They refused to give up a day 's wages for such a sentimentality . The day fell on Thursday , a bright warm spring day . The many thousands of young girls , in uniforms of white waists with red collars , all in line , were ready to march on . The sun illuminated their pale but happy faces as they walked through the avenues and streets . Looking up at the skyscrapers where they slaved all year , their shiny eyes would gleam with pride and hope , as if they would speak and warn the world , ' Behold you who keep us in the darkness , no more are we to slave for you ! Together we stand now , men , women , creators of wealth , and together we shall stand to fight for our rights ! ' I kept my holiday , joined a small separate division of girls who gathered from different non-union sl.ops and , like myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I spent the rest of the day happily with my friends But for that day I paid with many , many miserable weeks that followed . The sun 's rays , creeping into my tiny room on the top floor , joyfully played on my face when I awoke early the next morning . I lay in bed , leisurely stretching and relaxing my poor legs , tired from marching . I was still full of the events of yesterday . My heart beat with warmth as I lay enjoying my sun-bath . The clock struck seven ; time to get ready for work ! Humming a favorite Russian song , I quickly dressed , tools my ordinary breakfast , a roll and a cup of mills which seemed so tasteful that morning , and down I marched to the shop . It was a glorious morning . The little buds on the trees in Madison Square were just opening up into beautiful bloom and spread such a pleasant fragrance around . The small fountain in the centre bubbled , bubbled , splashing out right and left . I stopped for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The great mass of workers who were passing by all seemed light-hearted . It was the beautiful morning , the warm sun , the awakening of the green , that spread the good humor on their faces . I liked the world and wanted to greet everybody and everything , Good morning , good morning ! ' ? ' A fine morning ! ' ? ' A glorious morning ! ' ? Well , how did you like the march ? ' ? Was it not splendid ? ' ? ' Indeed , it was wonderful ! ' was heard all around as the workers met on their way to the *cps . Good morning , ' said I merrily to the foreman , who happened to be the first to meet me when I entered the shop . Good morning , ' came an angry sound from his nose . ' It is too nice a morning to be angry , ' I teased the foreman . ' If you think that you can make a living on nice mornings or May holidays , why do you come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that something was wrong , and that my good humor would not gain the foreman 's favor , so I quietly went over to my machine , and bent my head over my work . Meanwhile , the girls began to fill up their places at the machines . Some would stop near me , while passing , and ask how the march looked . ' It cost me a day 's wages to know , and I think that it is too expensive to tell , ' was my reply to all of them . ' Good morning , Miss Union-lady . ' I jumped up , instinctively feeling that it was I who was addressed . A sudden laughter spread over the shop from the workers , much amused by that greeting . On the other side of the table stood the boss , calling me angrily . With a sudden foreboding of some evil happening , I walked over to him . ' Look here , miss , you know that I think that you are too smart for my place . ' ' What is it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if you did n't know ! I do n't want you to make trouble in my shop . What business have you to bother my workers ? You made some of them stop from work when I was in a rush to finish out a lot of dresses . ' ' Why , you complain all the time that there was nothing to do and your workers sit idle . How did you happen to have such a rush all of a sudden ? ' ' Oh , you get on my nerve ! I am not going to stand it any longer , ' he said disgustedly , and walked away . On Saturday , I received my pay and was discharged . So I lost my job for celebrating the first of May . Now that I had to look for another job , I made up my mind to get a place only in a union shop . I thought that in the union shops the bosses just carry out every clause agreed to in the Protocol ; but I soon found out that the workers had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to the agreement . The dull season had already begun , and it was not easy to find a job . Those who had their shops kept their positions : no new help was needed . In the shops where a cheap line of dresses or waists were made , the busy season lasts until July . I might be able to get a place on a cheap line of dresses . I had worked on a good line of dresses , that require more skill and care ; I could expect to earn but little on the cheaper grades where speed was required more than skill . At that time some members of the Cooperative League had kept ? and still keep , a few apartments together . I learned from the people who lived there that it cost very cheap . As I had not enough money to live on , I moved into their cooperative house . Indeed , the expenses were small : $3.50 per month for a room , ? two people in each , ? and $2.50 per week for two meals a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head aching from the July heat , I wandered around until I found myself on a bench at Riverside Drive . The thought that I had to go out early in the morning to look for another position , and fearing that I might strike a job similar to my previous ones , made me so unhappy that I felt I could much easier jump into the Hudson than look for any more work ; and work I had got to get , for I was so short in money that I hardly had enough for the little expenses we had in the cooperation . It was for the last six weeks that I had no more than two scanty meals a day . I had to provide for carfare and could not spare a dime for a lunch . Now my younger brother was soon to conic from Russia . I had to provide something for him when he comes . The sun already hid her last golden rays . Twilight set upon the Hudson . I still sat on a bench and had no notion to move . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful ! It scorned to me a paradise-like , in comparison with my room , where the air was so choking in the July month . Boats ? all kinds of them ? swam up and down the river . The noise of the motor-boats allured me to the waters ; it made me feel homesick . There on the river surrounded by willow trees we would row and sing . Sometimes our happy young voices would be . heard for miles and appreciated by the old folks , who sat resting peacefully on the benches near their homes . How sweet those days passed ! Now I sit here broken-hearted , disappointed , and tired out . Life , life ? 0 Happiness , where is thy sweetness ! ' murmured I , in such mortal anguish for life . A heavy melancholy took possession of me and dragged me , dragged me down to the waters where the many little fires of the Palisades took their evening dips in the dark , quiet waves of the Hudson River . I forgot everything . The choking shops , my home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below , I saw the graceful trees around me , and I was a little happy . Would not my stomach remind me of hunger , I would not have thought of leaving the park , so comfortable . I had had nothing to eat since early morning , and made my way towards home . I walked along Riverside , looking into the windows of the colossal hotels and beautiful private palaces . No light was seen in any of them . The places were left by the people for their summer resorts . It 's a pity that such comfortable houses were empty the most of the year . Their dwellers flew around the country , from one resort to another to spend their time . They never worried for their to-morrow 's bread , they never feared to lose their jobs , they never wandered in the parks with hungry stomachs . They had people , thousands of people , somewhere in mines , or factories , or stores , who starved for them , who hammered the gold for them . The only worry those dwellers have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor of so many thousands of people , who part with their happiness and so often with their lives for the pleasure of those few idlers , who spend their life in continuous vacations and eternal luxury . How many people of the East Side , how many families of the cooped tenement-houses , enjoy these comfortable dwellings and lovely air of the RiverSide Park and Hudson River ? Thought I , here the houses stood all locked up , of no use to anybody . They would only reopen for a month or so , when their landlord happens to come from Europe to make preparations for the next journey . Oh , how unfair , how unfair the present system of life is ! thought I. Here am I , who want to work , who would gladly sell her hands for a decent wage , but gets nothing , and those who never think of work have too much . Did I envy the rich that evening ? Oh , no ! I hated them , I hated them ; for to me they seemed worse than highway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who rule the world with their iron power . Two years in the golden country ! What did I accomplish ? A weak stomach , headaches every other day , a paler face , inflamed eyes , and my nose ? my nose began also to complain . It wanted a doctor and I could not afford to pay any doctor bills . To a dispensary I had no time to go , and I would not , even if time I had , for they ignored the patient there too much . One dollar made a world of difference . For a dollar the doctor would gently open the door for the patient , would offer a thousand of smiles , take his time , and examine the patient thoroughly . In the dispensary one has to waste some time and all day to get his turn ; and when at last one gets the chance to see the doctor , the latter treats him so indignantly and sends such looks , that it makes one feel as though one did not come to the doctor for advice but to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , if she could only know ! But never should she know ! It is enough for her , when she had to part with us . As she wrote once to me , ' Another child left , another wound in mother 's heart ! Oh , where are my children , my little birds ? Was mother 's nest too small for them ? Oh , if I only was a free bird now , if I only had wings , I would fly , fly , through night and day , through storm and sunshine , through oceans and forests and lied my children , who left mother to find a better life , to build better nests . For so many years I struggled ; in the long stormy winter nights , I watched over you , cherished you . With my tears and prayers to God I obtained your lives when death stood many a time at your bedside , waiting for mother to give you up . Never did I give you up . You were my pride , you were my light in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you gave up mother so easily ! You left your home with no regret ! You left your mother to her tears ! 011 , where are you now ? Are you happy , are you warm , are you fed ? If I could only embrace you once more , feel you near my wounded heart ! Other people have the pleasure to hear you talk , to hear VOL. 121 - NO. 2 you laugh , to hear you sing ! Are you still singing , my little ( laughter , or was your voice forgotten under the heavy burden of the new life ? ' That letter made me hysterical for a few hours when I first received it , and long afterwards whenever I reread it , I could not control myself from crying . There is so much tragedy in each word of that letter . The tragedy of all the Jewish mothers , whose children escape from where they suffer . They escape from the Russian brutality , from the Galician poverty . The youth do not want to bow their heads as the parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so much ! Youth wants life , happiness . In the hunt for a better , more free life , they part with their dear parents ; they part full of hope to be reunited in a better land in better circumstances . But more often the hopes are crushed , the lives are broken . Not all are able to reunite , and they remain parted far , far away from one another . The eternal anxiety for one another tears their hearts and souls in pieces . Neither the children in America nor the parents in the foreign lands can ever be happy when they are parted . Never should she know ! ' I repeated to myself ; and to comfort her I immediately sat down to write a letter to my mother . Much beloved Mother ,  --  First of all I want to inform you that I am in perfect health and happiness , wishing to hear the same from you . ' Here I stopped . Wishing to hear the same from you ? ' Goodness , i surely do not wish to curse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . shall I tell her ? What shall I write to her about ? I started another one . ' My best of best Mothers , ? With delight I read your last letter . I was so happy to learn that everything at home is in order . Please , mother , do n't cry . It worries me terribly . We are not dead , we are alive . We 'll try our very best to have you all with us in the nearest future . Oh , how happy I shall be when I 'll have you all with us . Sorrow will be forgotten and the guardian angels will spread their wings over us and watch over our happiness , and never , never again will we part ! Tell the children that I will answer their letters some other time . Nathan 's poem , which he dedicated to me , was very hearty , but I do n't like his grammar in it . This was always his weak part . Tell him to pay more attention to the Russian grammar . You know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little fellow . He is only sixteen now , and if he has good opportunities , he 'll make success . With pride you tell me mother that little Eva is my double ? that physically and mentally she resembles me , , I want to hope that she should he much better than I have been and more successful . ' How is Sarah ? Is she diligent in her studies ? Is Dora stronger now than she was ? Have you any letters from Israel , or he writes only when he needs money ? Poor fellow , for two more years he must serve his country . ' He serves the country which rejected all his applications to enter any educational institution . His highest ambition since childhood was to enter a school of fine arts . The little portraits that he painted were very promising , but as a Jew only one in a thousand could ever have a chance to enter such schools , and mostly those who had the money ; so that he , my brother Israel , never realized his wish . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back home from the war with a wounded leg . ' Please , mother , send me his address . I want to write a letter to him . About us you should not worry . We are all right . ' My best regards to all the children and father ? to him I 'll write tomorrow . I have so much to tell him ! Our correspondence discussions were stopped for quite a long time , and I want to begin again . Is he still working so hard ? Mother dear , take care of yourself , father and children . Yours with love ,
