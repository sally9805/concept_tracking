 | MODERN football has reached such an advanced stage that the fundamental problem of all coaches , East or West , North or South , is to turn out players with thirty-five-year-old heads on about twenty-yearold bodies . There are other tasks which vary somewhat according to the point in attack on which the coach believes he should put the greatest emphasis , the proper proportion on attack between plays relying mainly upon power and those relying principally on deception ; but whatever his choice , and whatever his troubles , he must try in the month of October to develop football brains at a rate that would startle an instructor in mathematics or some other non-athletic subject . His success will not be apparent until November , when , as a rule , the more important games are scheduled . Right here it might be well to make it plain that by " important " games I mean those that are played annually over a term of years . Defeats will be met by the way , and at the hands of colleges that deserve to rank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must stand or fall on the outcome of what they call their " big " games . Thus while Harvard was beaten strictly on the merits of the day 's work by Tufts , and Illinois by Colgate , it does not follow that the game was the correct season 's measure of the power of the defeated elevens . In passing it is worth mentioning that both Tufts and Colgate have played good , sound football for some years with the added distinction of innovation on attack that was of permanent value to the game . For many years , until Yale under Frank Hinkey reversed the process for the time being , the fundamental difference between East and West in coaching lay in the fact that Eastern men were prone to develop the defense first , while Western coaches , and they are good ones , too , began with the attack , and , indeed , the Western attack generally remained a jump or two ahead of the Western defense thruout the season . Recently , however , there has been a growing tendency to try to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest problems a coach can face . There comes a time , and that usually about the first week in November , when a coach can feel reasonably sure of which type of eleven he has on his hands ; will know whether his eleven is to be stronger on attack or defense , and so he will plan his work accordingly . It is ancient history that strong defensive elevens have won their big games against teams that were far superior in attack , which means for one thing that they have had fine punters and drop-kickers , and a line , especially on the ends , strong in down the field work . Occasionally even the punting has been turned into an offensive measure , deadly kicking to the corners of the field putting the opponents into almost as ugly a situation as if they had been driven there by a running game . It is therefore reasonable to suppose that a coach who begins the season with one or more good kickers at hand will do one of two things ? develop this kicking game to its utmost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a running game as quickly as possible , feeling that the finesse of the kicking game can be imparted in a hurry . The first method is by far the safest , and that is the method that has been adopted by John H. Rush , at Princeton , this October . He had at hand in the person of Driggs one of the game 's greatest punters , and so he used this asset to defeat Holy Cross in the season 's opening game , in the meantime working up the end play and seeking a backfield that was not asked to win the early combats by means of the running game , but was merely asked to get together . He was looking for the right combination , and the biggest problem in that combination lay at quarterback , a problem not yet solved . Princeton had a remarkably fine team last year in every essential save the headwork in the quarterback position . Rush has been determined to do better in that respect this season , with the result that he has been sending Ames in for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sometimes they have been under instructions , and again have been allowed to go their own way . In general , we find that punting won the opening game for the Tigers , and that drop-kicking was just good enough to defeat Tufts , which had beaten Harvard . Against North Carolina the disparity between the two lines , especially on one side , was sufficiently apparent to justify greater emphasis in kicking , with a forward pass slipt in from time to time . Thru October the line has acquitted itself well with occasional poor play at tackle , this latter apparently by no means incurable , and , equipped with good kicking and the first signs of a promising running offense which seems to be strongest just inside tackle or thru the guard positions , Princeton looks formidable . Percy Haughton and his aids have faced about the most difficult problems in the East . They were beyond solution in time to come cleanly thru the October games , for they included the development of kickers and the filling of serious gaps in the eleven due to graduation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driven hard by Leo Leary and his assistants . Even Bert Waters , famed as a driver , was sent for to help in " putting the punch " in the eleven . This on the eve of the Tufts  | game . All to no avail . The players were too green to take the coaching at the rate it was given to them . Haughton came late to the task and found that Leary had been unable to give him a team so far advanced as in previous years . Now in the last few years Harvard has had a strong running game made up of a neat combination of power and deception , the latter being made by men whom Haughton called his " decoys , " more familiarly known to other coaches as " two in deception , " and all this was backed by fine kicking and end play . The whole was run with superb generalship . While such powerful backs as Wendell and Bradlee were in the game , with such a man as Hardwick on the end to cut down the secondary defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but put on the deception whenever it found opponents given to looking at their own feet rather than at the Crimson attack . Last year , because of the wonderful speed and feinting ability of Eddie Mahan , the emphasis was on deception , with results against Princeton and Yale with which we are all familiar . The interesting feature of Harvard 's November play will be to see what Haughton 's decision has been in the way of emphasis on attack . There is evidence in the October play that he has been trying out both forms and has not yet made up his mind . He has fast end runners in Casey and Willcox , both of whom will take a lot of coaching , and only fair backs so far in Bond , Flower , and especially Horween , who was expected to carry the burden of the heavier line running . Yet the development has been slow , and it has been handicapped too by the fact that the Crimson line has also been very green . In the early games there was none of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense , that has distinguished the Crimson defense of recent years . On the whole , and despite the fact that the result of the Cornell game can not be included in this review , I think there is enough evidence to warrant the expectation of the development of at the very least a good , average football team at Harvard . And it is quite within the range of possibilities that it will be better than average by the middle of November . Teams that have been turned out under the Harvard system of recent years have not infrequently come along with a rush in four or five days . Yale 's first month of play has been fairly satisfactory to the coaches . Tad Jones enjoyed the advantage of having at command , in the person of Le Gore , a fine , all-round back ? a good kicker , a strong , elusive runner and an excellent hand with the forward pass . Thus he had all the threats needed in his backfield and so could make an early start with the running attack . The opposition was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if I bar a rather puzzling and at times rather stupid type of play by the Eli ends , the defense showed vast improvement , and was especially sound against the forward pass . Swinging into November Yale seems to ' nave better than an average outfit of backs , with one real star , field generals who are only fair , and a line that is still very much unsettled . Arthur Brides is in charge of the line and he has done well , altho the men are still not using their hands as a true Yale line should , and at times even the stance is wrong . There have been times , too , ever since the opening of the season , when certain of the Yale forwards , including Captain Black , have been rather too easily spilt . However , the Blue is certainly more formidable than last year , and there are internal evidences in the posting of certain of the men that the Blue still has at command the lateral pass . It may not be used much , but it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rivals , began their campaigns well equipped with promising material , the Ithacans , however , having lost the greater number of stars . Cornell enjoyed the advantage of the continuance of a sound and successful coaching system , while Pennsylvania came out for the first time under Bob Folwell . Dr. Sharpe 's problem at Ithaca was to fill the vacancies left by Cool at center , Shelton at end , and the great Barrett in the backfield . To the outside public the loss of Barrett seemed the greatest misfortune , whereas in reality Cool was the hardest man to replace . The Ithacans run nearly all their plays from kick formation , the ball going direct from center to runner , which means that everything depends upon the passing from the center , which , under this system , is complicated and difficult . How well the coaches have been able to fill Cool 's place will have been fairly settled in the Harvard game . The indications are that Cornell will have another great line , with promise of good ends . There are also plenty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more promising than I have seen in years , and this despite the defeat by Swarthmore . Like Cornell , the Red and Blue is well equipped with backs , and the kicking department is in good hands . The principal difficulty , I think , will lie in getting the generalship in good  | order , for the lack of it nearly lost the opening game , and Bell , at quarterback , fumbled away the Swarthmore match . Army and Navy , at the close of the October building process , were closer together than was the case a year ago . The Soldiers have a wonderful line from tackle to tackle , experienced quarterbacks , and at least three remarkable punters and dropkickers who can be used in the backfield at the same time . Incidentally , Charley Daly , who heads the coaching staff , and Lieutenant Prichard , who is helping with the backs , were among the most remarkable quarterbacks in the history of the game , a significant fact . If the Army team is not run with perfect generalship in its big game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to teach it . The real West Point problem is the development of ends . At Annapolis there seems to have been marked improvement over a year ago under Lieutenant Ingram , who is heading the coaching staff for the second successive season . There is in evidence a much better rounded attack , a line already showing considerable strength , and a good backfield , which may be handled by Roberts , a Plebe who made a handsome record at Colgate . The eleven was beaten by a single point by Pittsburgh , but in that game met one of the most brilliant running attacks the East has to show , albeit somewhat marred by fumbling . Under the coaching of Glenn S. Warner , Pittsburgh shows promise of another good year , the field leader being Captain Peck , one of last season 's three great centers . As a deviser of brilliant end run formations Warner has no master , and his attack is usually very strong in other respects . The eleven is fighting it out with Syracuse as these lines appear , and there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this time under the coaching of Bill Hollenback . Because of the type of Warner 's attack such a game is a hard one for the defensive ends . Syracuse still has that wonderful pair of guards of a year ago , however , Captain White , the biggest man playing football , and Schlacter . These , by their ability to break thru , are terrors to any attack , often breaking it up before it can get out against the tackles and ends . Hollenback is a capable and versatile coach , and before the season is over should show a few ground-gaining devices of his own . Dartmouth faces the same old problem , that of finding a quarterback whose generalship is up to his individual play . Frank Cavanaugh believes he has one in the person of Cannell , but up to the Georgetown game the Green had met no opponent strong enough to settle the point . With Thielscher , Gerrish and Duhamel carrying the ball and Gerrish punting , the eleven from Hanover has an attack that is remarkable for its power , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close slant play that has always been such a terror in American football , ancient or modern . In common with Dartmouth and Syracuse , not to mention Cornell , Brown University simply galloped thru the early season , rolling up big scores . So good is the material this year at Providence that Ed . Robinson , the veteran coach , seems to have no particular individual problem on his hands . He simply has to bring his eleven along to concert pitch in team work . The South demonstrated very little in the first month of the season , most of the scores being very one-sided , and the Southerners who ventured North failing to show their accustomed strength . Vanderbilt and Georgetown seem to be comfortably in the lead at this writing . Prospects are bright for Michigan in the West ? that is , in upholding the reputation of the Middle West , since Michigan 's really big games are with Eastern elevens . Michigan teams are , however , like their coach , of national interest . The outlook was not promising when Yost first called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ famous Captain Maulbetsch to top physical condition , and the discovery of a capable quarterback in Sparks , the Maize and Blue began to look up a little . Whenever Yost and his cohorts come East one hears a great deal of " trick plays , " etc. , and Yost has invented a lot of deceptive forms of attack , but when it comes right down to brass tacks he does not build on them as heavily ' as the public thinks . His supporters , yea , his idolizers , will tell you that all he needs is a couple of good backs who can forward pass , and good ends , and he will have a wonderful team . Yost knows better . " That 's all very well , " he will tell you , " but there never yet was a fine football team without a strong line . " On the Pacific Coast the University of California , under Andrew Smith of Pennsylvania and Eddie Mahan of Harvard , looks promising , altho for a real line on the team one will have to await @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be particular danger in that section from the University of Washington , with which eleven Gilmour Dobie has been terrorizing many miles of football territory for years . It is planned that Syracuse is to play the championship eleven of the Pacific Coast after the close of the Eastern season , and Pennsylvania , too , is looking for a game on the Coast . Transcontinental football , however , has yet to settle any fundamental dispute between the two sections . And with all this revival of real American football in California Leland Stanford Jr . University still clings to English Rugby , a game in which she can find no serious rival save club teams like the Olympic and the Barbarians .
