txt While the battle in Champagne is being fought by the French and American troops , the British armies from Flanders to the Somme remain on the alert . This morning 's news of Foch 's dramatic counterblow between Soissons and Chateau-Thierry , with its menace of turning the enemy 's right flank , will have a great effect on them . It is what they have been hoping for . It is in the tradition of the Foch school of strategy which he has had to deny himself so long because of enemy superiority in numbers at the beginning of the offensive , but now at last the balance of numbers on the western front has begun to tip in our favor , and Foch is able to use hi : reserves with greater freedom and surety of striking power . The great patience of the French General , whose motto is " Attack , " was put to the severest strain after March 21 , when- for many weeks he had to husband his forces and remain on the defensive , but this morning the hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's enormous efforts on each side of Rheims , he seized the rychological moment to strike him on the right wing of the German salient between the Aisne and the Marne . The British Army 's future depends intimately on the progress of that French counterstroke and on the necessity of the German Crown Prince for more men to replace all those dead and bleeding soldiers who lie on the slopes and in the valleys east and west of Rheims . He is as deeply engaged now as he was at Verdun , and can not call off the battle which he began after months of preparation . Rupprecht Waiting Anxiously . Opposite the British front , in some old French ch  --  teau behind the German lines , far beyond the zone of the British gunfire , there is a group of men who must be reading the reports from the Crown Prince 's staff with extreme anxiety and nervous tension . Chief among them is Prince Rupprecht of Bavaria , commanding the group of armies against the British front , and with him are his army commanders and corps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opponent of the British in the first battles of the Somme , and von Bernhardi , who , it is said , has the most passionate hatred of Britain among all the German Generals . These men have been preparing another wide offensive against the British front . They are the men who have - their eyes on the coast as the goal of their desires , and are ready even now to make another desperate bid for it . They have been working hard since their previous efforts came to a dead halt after heavy losses . The hundreds of thousands of men under their command have been put to the utmost strain , building light railways over the old battlefields , making and repairing roads , digging new gunp ; ts and communication trenches , and weaving a network of telephone wires , so that on a given morning all the material of war shall be at hand for the assaulting troops and , every means of communication shall be ready for them . Delayed by Epidemic . It all takes a longer time than they had hoped to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that enabled the British to dig stronger lines against them and reorganize strengthened their defensive power . Their program of speed has been slowed down by an epidemic of Influenza , which hit them badly several weeks ago and spread with such virulence that many of their battalions were incapable of hard work and hundreds of men went sick in many divisions . It seems to be burning itself out now , this fever which makes men fall off their horses and sink at the knees quite sudeesnly , with a high temperature that keeps them away for six days or so . But even now there are large numbers of cases , limiting the output of work in preparations for the at4.ck . Other things have delayed and weakened them . British airplanes yesterday , as every day for months past , flew low over their lines and back areas , bombing and machinegunning their working parties , causing heavy casualties and doing destructive work over their railways , airdromes , camps , and dumps , and the British guns used every fine hour to range on their batteries and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroying work newly done so that it has to be begun again  --  more delay irritating , to the German Generals , who know the value of time , more delay and greater demoralization of the troops holding the line . Another and Greater Anxiety . But Rupprecht and his Generals , ready to begin this offensive against the British , have now another anxiety , which may spoil all their plans and render all their elaborate preparations useless if they have not enough men to throw in at the mom , ent arranged . If this great attack east and west of Rheims had gone well , he would still have enough men , and more than enough , to strike with immense strength , such as he is bound to have , considering the defensive preparations the British have made . But what if orders come to send divisions to the help of the Crown Prince , now seriously jeopardized by the French counterblow ? The whole problem of Rupprecht and his Generals and the history of the next few weeks rest on that development of events . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flame along the British front , and all the British soldiers will be involved in a life and death struggle . If his divisions are called away to help in Ithat other battle , these commanders of the German armies in the north may have to be content with mere holding actions or with inactivity . So in the north of this western front the British and German Armies are both hungering for news of what is happening in Champagne , knowing that upon events there depends their own action in the immediate future . It is even possible that any French success between the Aisne and the Marne will hasten the offensive against the British front , and that , instead of sending many men down south , Rupprecht will strike with the object of keeping allied troops away from that scene of action . Twenty-four hours more of history may decide which plan the German high command think best , but today , anyhow , they must be thinking hard and be filled with doubt and apprehension . They are playing all but their last cards as far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must do whatever they do within the next two months or so , and after that they will forever be on the defensive , because their reserve power can not maintain the same level as the Allies ' , with the American legions behind them . World 's Fate Soon to be Decided . The fate of the wArld will be decided before the lea es turn brown on this year 's trees , and perhaps before the harvest is gathered in. 1 believe it will be decided in our favor . The enemy is still immensely strong . One 's mind is staggered by the number cf men he crowded on to this western front , but he is using them up apace , and we know he is not replacing them at anything like the rate of loss . He is immensely strong on this front , but so are the British , and he knows that they have had time to repair the losses of March and April and to prepare a close scheme of defense , with positions which can only be taken by enormous sacrifice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as on other days , in places which used to be far behind the British lines . The enemy knows they are there , for he has photographed them from airplanes , but the knowledge will not do him any good . Yesterday he tried hard with his air service to survey the back areas , and time after time his airplanes attempted to cross the anti-aircraft barrage in daylight for reconnoissance of the roads and rails . Beyond much doubt he wanted to know whether there was much movement behind our lines . The British airplanes , as well as anti-aircraft batteries , fought him back , and in the Albert sector heavy guns were pouring shells into his positions , so that there was a great tumult , under the glare of the sun which streamed down upon our men working in their fields , through which hew , trenches show where the chalk is turned up . Kite balleons kept watch over the enemy lines . Their were snow white , also , in the blue of the sky , until storm clouds gathered , strangely colored , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The night before last there was a voilent thunderstorm , followed by an hour or two of almost tropical rain , and with such loud and rattling peals of thunder that it seemed as though another battle had begun . But between the rains the sun shines warm again , with a moist , sultry heat , the heat that sets the soldier 's throat- on fire ' when he lies out wounded on the battlefield and makes the agony of war more terrible in sunshine than under the gray skies of Winter . Down there in Champagne , where the ? French and American soldiers are fighting in one of the great battles of the world  --  which even at a little distance one thinks of in an abstract way , not as of great numbers of young men crouching in the shelter of hills swept with storms of shells before they move forward into the open against an infernal gunfire , but rather as impersonal forces rearranging their position , which other men far from the noise of battle draw out upon a map  --  there must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun shines down brilliantly with golden light . Behind the British front , even within gun range , the men like this warm weather and sun themselves outside their dugouts unless a 6.9 drops near . The American soldiers dig trenches to ragtime songs , with a queer rhythm in their picks and shovels , and in their camps among the trees lie outside their pup tents as they call those little canvas shelters which they carry in . their packs , stopping between hard spells of training or writing letters home . In places along the line it is very unhealthy just now , for the German gunners have been shooting special hates around about Scherpenberg and about Hinges and Bethune , and on the north side of Albert . On the south side of the Somme the Australians , who never rest for long in the same line , made another advance southeast of Villers-Brettoneux , where they captured 1 officer and 33 men and brought back two field guns and two machine guns after walking forward 600 yards on a 2,000-yard front . The enemy retaliated by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not counterattack . Some of their divisions in the line have no fight left in them , and are waiting for storm troops behind them to relieve them before the next massacre to which they are dedicated by their high command , for it will be nothing less than a massacre when it comes , whatever ground they take or fail to take .
