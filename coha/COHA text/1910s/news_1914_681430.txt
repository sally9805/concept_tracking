txt Tae Official Press Bureau issues a descriptive account of doings on the British front , communicated by an eye-witness at General Headquarters , who is now known to be Col. Swinton of the Intelligence Department . His story , which continues and supplements the narrative Published Oct. 0 , of the movements of the British force and the French armies in immediate touch with it , follows : " Comparative calm on our front has continued through the fine and considerably warmer weatner . The last six days have been slightly misty with clouds ' hanging low , so that conditions have not been very favorable for aerial reconnoissance . " In regard to the latter , it is astonishing how quickly the habit is acquired , even by those who are not aviators , of thinking of the weather in terms of its suitability for flying . There has been a bright moon also , which has militated against night attacks . " On Saturday , Oct. 3 , practically nothing happened , except that each side shelled the other .

Two of the struggles were , so far as could be seen , indecisive , but in the third the French airmen were victorious , and brought down their opponents , both of whom were killed by machine gun fire .

" On that evening our airmen had an unusual amount of attention paid to them , both by the German aviators and their artillery of every description . " One of our infantry patrols discovered 150 dead Germans in a wood , one and a half miles from our front . We sent a party out to bury them , but it was fired upon and had to withdraw . " On Tuesday the 6th the enemy 's guns were active in the afternoon . It is believed that the bombardment was due to anger because two of our howitzer shells had detonated right in one of the enemy 's trenches. which was full of men . Three horses were killed by the German fire . " Wednesday , the 7th , was uneventful . " On Thursday , the 9th , the shelling bx the enemy of a locality on our front , which has so far been the scene of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or two points the Germans have attempted to gain ground by sapping in some places with the view of secretly pushing forward machine guns in advance of their trenches , so that they can suddenly sweep with crossfire the space between our line and theirs ; and so take any advance of ours on the flank . Dug ** Tunnel , Blew lip Gun . " It is reported that at one point where the French were much annoyed by the fire of a German machine gun , which was otherwise inaccessible , they drove a mine gallery , 50 meters , ( about 164 feet ) long , up to and under the emplacement , and blew up the gun . The men who drove the gallery belonged to a corps which was recruited in one of the coal-mining districts of France . " The German machine guns are mounted on low sledges , and are inconspicuous and evidently easily moved . " The fighting now consists mostly of shelling by the artillery of both sides and in front a line of fire from the ma -- chine guns as an occasional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and have proved most efficient weapons for the sort of fighting in which we are now engaged . " At times there are so many outbursts of their fire in different directions that it is possible for an expert to tail by comparison which of the guns have their springs ' adjusted ' and are well tuned up for the day .. The amount of practice that our officers are now getting in the use . of this weapon is proving most valuable in teaching them how to maintain it at concert pitch as an instrument and how to derive the best tactical results from its employment . Says Germans Waste Shells . " Against us the Germans are not now expending so much gun ammunition as they have been , but they continue , to , fire at insignifIcaxkt.targets .. They have the habit of sudden157-droming heavy Isheik'a. rent ' warning in localities or oirtincted'ort.PaiWili : : villages far behind our front line . possibly on . the chance of catching some of our troops in bivouac or billets . They also fire a few rounds at night . ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a part in the war that a few general remarks descriptive of the methOdb ? d ? it5 ? employment by the enemy are justified . Their field artillery armament consists of 15-pounder quick-fire guns for horse and field batteries of divisions and there are . In addition with each corps three to six batteries of 4.3-inch field howitzers and about two batteries.01.5.9-inch howitzers . With an army there are some 8.2-inch heavy howitzers . " The . accuracy Of ' their ' fire ' is apt at first to cause some alarm . more especially as the guns are usually well concealed and ' die position and the direction from which the fire is proceeding are difficu , lt. of.detectian ? . Elut accurate as is their shooting , the German gunners have on the whole had little luck .  --  and during the.past. three weeks an astonishingly small proportion of the number of shells fired by them have been really effective .

Thus , when the target is found , its position on the map is telephoned to such batteries as it is desired to employ against that particular square . " In addition to the guns employed to fire on the targets as they are picked up , others are told off to watch particular roads and to deal with any of the enemy using them . How Airmen Guide Gunners . " Both for the location of targets and the communication of the effect of the fire , reliance Is placed on observation from aeroplanes and balloons . and on information , supplied by special observers and secret agents , who are sent out ahead or left behind in the enemy 's lines to communicate by telephone or signal . These observers have been found in haystacks , barns and other buildings well in advance of the German lines . " Balloons of the so-called sausage pattern remain up in the air for long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our aviators made their influence felt by ceasing all hostile aeroplanes on sight the latter were continually hovering over our troops in order to register their positions and to note where the headquarters , reserves , gun teams , etc. , were located . " If suitable targets are discovered , the airman drops a smoke ball directly over it or lets fall some strips of tinsel , which glitter in the sun as they slowlydescend to the earth . The range to the target is apparently ascertained by those near the guns by a large telemeter , or other range finder , which is kept trained on the aeroplane , so that when the signal Is made the distance to the target vertically below is at once obtained . A few rounds are then fired , and the result is signaled back by the aviator , according to some prearranged code . " WAR-MAKERS CRIMINALS . Explains Their Craving for World'r Indorsement , Says Father Wynne . The Rev. John J. Wynne , S. J. , editor of the Catholic Encyclopaedia , has written a letter to the New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Peace , " based on his conclusions drawn from the desire of the nations at war in Europe to retain the good opinion ? of the nations not at war . He wrote : " The most sure and significant thing about the war at present raging in Europe is that the nations engaged in it are quite as much concerned about keeping the good opinion of other nations not at war , especially of this country , as they are about comiro- off victoriously . So far at least as the Press reports go , we even hear more of the ? white books ' ( papers ) than we do of I the actual fighting or tosses on both sides . " Does it not seem as if the adverse public opinion is felt to be as hurtful by the people at war as the corporeal wounds inflicted on the battlefield ? ' This national sensitiveness is very significant . It is , perhaps , the greatest tribute on record to the power of public opinion . It is convincing testimony to the fact that a rightly guided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nations of the world at peace ' ? It is , therefore , highly important that a nation should not be content with the state of peace , but that it should cultivate among its citizens a spirit of peace . This is the important lesson to be derived from the ' frantic efforts that all the warring - nations are making daily to justify themselves in the eyes of the peopWs that are still in peace , and to disclaim the responsibility for the wanton and altogether unjustifiable destruct ; of human life and happiness . is plain words , the men who are guilty of having brought about the present conflict know in their hearts that they are guilty of a wrong unparalleled in the annals of crime . They know for certain that they are in danger of being branded as criminals of the most nefarious type . They know that no military triumph can ever compensate them for the loss of the esteem and goodwill of all rightly thinking persons . " Here , then , is an influence which can be brought to bear upon mankind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps the first step to take in aiming at universal peace is to overcome the pessimistic or cynical convictions , altogether too prevalent , that war is a necessary evil and that such a thing as universal peace is nothing more than a dream . Why should wars among the nations be necessary ? Ir . ninety-nine hundredths ' of the citizens of It nation can dwell in peace together and adjust their mu-. tual differences , no matter how . antagonistic they may be , in the most peaceable manner , why should they as a body ever need to resort to the force of arms in adjusting their collective differences as a nation with any other people ' : ? ? Does it not seem altogether paradoxical to think that millions of people who live in peace among themselves can ever of their own accord conceive such hostility toward the people of any other nation as to think of no other means of adjusting their differences with them except by mutual slaughter ? " The fact is that the people of a country at large never really want war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation rarely want war : it should , therefore , not be considered impossible to prevent any interested parties in any country , . whether , they . be a militaristic or economistic clique , to foment a spirit of hostility against any other nation . " It is highly significant that such baneful factors in the present war are doing their level best to justify themselves or to disclaim responsibility for it . Their regard for public opinion means that public opinion is more powerful than they , and that if public opinion is so directed to make for a spirit of peace , there will be no room in any people for a spirit of war .
