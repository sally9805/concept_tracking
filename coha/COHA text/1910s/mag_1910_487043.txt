SIR The historical teaching of English has undoubtedly done much good . It has helped us to see how in each age literature is a reflection of life , it has shown us the continuity of literature and enabled us to arrange our knowledge conveniently . And yet it may be questioned whether the system has given us enough to compensate for what it has taken away . To be sure , the taking away has not been a necessity , and could , indeed , be easily prevented . The effect , however , has often been to fill the students ' heads ( temporarily ) with names , dates , and facts to the exclusion of all else A dull writer is studied for his historical importance , while a genius is slighted because he is not typical or epoch-making Thus an unclassified author , for instance , Lander , has a poor chance The questions asked in examination are riot : What poetical qualities appealed to you in " Childe Harold ? " but : Show hciw Byron exempli fies the contemporary spirit of individualistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a literary historian , and a critic as well , though the latter character requires a far higher type of mind than the former . An historian , in the narrower sense here implied , has but to record facts , whereas the critic endeavors to determine by fixed canons the artistic value of a given work It is therefore easy to see why the absolute worth of a poem , apart from time and circumstance , is often left unconsidered , I do not wish to be misunderstood on this point . I understand from experience the value and the pedagogical expediency of the historical method ; it seems merely a case of ? These things ye ought to do and not to leave the others undone . The practical result on the student should be examined . He knows that by memorizing lectures and synopses of the required readings he can pass in the course , he is lukewarm in his interest , finds the lectures dull , and has no temptation to read for himself . How shall his apathy be overcome ? Obviously by teaching him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superior smile says : " Oh , we do n't attempt to inculcate a love of literature ; the student must do that for himself . " By all means , let him  --  if he is able But who , at a first reading , can perceive the possibilities of a great poem ? Who does not remember a hard passage made straight or a splendid line illuminated by the comment of a friend or a teacher of the old school ? Very recently a ' noted professor of English said to me : " We need more intensive and appreciative literary courses " By reading aloud in class , or by analyses which are not dissections , the instructor may awaken a permanent interest and a desire in the student to look deeper and apply for himself the careful sympathy which has been shown him Perhaps this may seem like taking a leaf from the book of the despised public lecturer , but why should we not ? Is the power of reading musical verse musically and noble verse nobly a detriment to a college instructor ? The ultimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth while ? Is it valuable for itself or only as a " human document " to show the life of the individual or his time ? If the latter position is correct , then the work of any sixteenth century scribbler may concern us as legitimately as that of Shakespeare Perhaps it is to avoid the risk of such a mistake that the English have been slow to introduce the systematic study of their own literature But nearly every one feels at bottom that the true value of poetry is absolute Genius is not a matter of evolution , says an able critic Homer enthralls us not because he pictures the heroic age of Greece , but because he is Homer . Call the Iliad a syndicate product , you will not affect its charm The greatest English master " was not for an age , " nor need we study his age to appreciate his greatest qualities . We have followed too blindly the dictum of Taine that all literature is the result of the time when and the people by whom it is produced . From this remorseless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mysticism . Scott , the frankest and least affected of bards , writes : " In sober rea , ity. writing good verses seems to depend upon something separate from the volition of the author . " This something , the vera caiesa of the poet , has not yet been defined , by the doctrine of WAR ece rtihtio it must come from somewhere , . but the most minute study of environment fails to account for it . So it is that the biographical and the historical systems of teaching threaten to come between us and the apprehension of what is best in literature . CHARLES WHARTON STORE . University of Pennsylvania , October 31 . AMELIA BOOTH AND LUCY FEVERELTHE EDITOR Or THE NATION : SIR : A comparison of some of the realistic novels of the eighteenth century with those of our own day has many points of interest . For example , let Fielding 's " Amelia " and Meredith 's " Richard Fever-el " be read with a view to such a comparison , and it will be found that the aim of both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the period in which the story is set , and to portray individuals which shall stand as types of that period , Making due allowance for the personal equation , the resulting difference lies largely in the changes in English life and thought . Points of likeness are not hard to find when one has shaken off the bewildering effect of Meredith 's bustling , crowding thoughts and unique personality , it is soon evident that both Fielding and Meredith scorn artificial sentimentalism , but have a decided taste for real sentiment , and that the attitude of each toward women is that of a kindly , though searching , analyst In both stories the conception of the heroine 's character is perhaps the best basis of comparison ; and surely among Meredith 's daughters ( to use Stevenson 's term ) no kindlier choice could be made than Lucy , for the gentle Amelia might Justly feel overshadowed if placed beside some of the more brilliant ladies of modern fiction As Amelia possesses some qualities not usually found in heroines of her day , so Lucy has much of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old-fashioned heroine . Amelia 's accomplishments are wholly of the domestic order , and she weeps and faints with the ease and grace demanded , of a lady of refinement in her day ; nevertheless , the author endows her with the somewhat unusual gifts of courage and humor In our time , when woman 's lack of humor has become an axiom ( with no convincing Q E D , however ) , it is refreshing to go back into the eighteenth century-and find Amelia 's keen sense of the ludicrous pointed out as one of her most engaging qualities , though it must be confessed that the proofs are not especially convincing Even so , she is in this respect rather in advance of Lucy , whose humor is more negative than that of most of Meredith 's heroines We are apt to consider the robust heroine as a growth of the modern novel , perhaps because of the generation of pallid , delicate beings immediately preceding her ; but it is to be observed that Fielding is an ardent admirer of health and vigor . Amelia 's fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with pride by her erring but appr eciative husband , they must have been remarkable , indeed , to persevere in spite of the utter disregard of physiology indicated by her waist in Cruikshank 's illustrations ! Her personality does not suggest the Venus of Milo as strongly as that of Meredith 's vigorous damsels , notably Carinthia ; but the author describes honest , capable health , of a kind calculated to please even a scientific humanist One minor touch of similarity in the two young women is their recourse to the gentle art of cookery , on occasions when Man is to be placated or beguiled Amelia waiting , after a misunderstanding , for Booth to come home to the favorite supper which she has prepared , and Lucy striving to win a place in the esteem of the " wise Youth " by her devotion to Dr Kitchener , have much in common , and proceed along well established lines . As Mrs Berry sagely observes to Lucy , " kissing do n't last , cookery do . " In the matter of conversation , the difference between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characters , lengthy , stilted , and detailed , does not suggest a deep penetration below the surface as a rule , while Meredith 's crisp , concentrated sentences give an almost uncanny revelation of the human heart and its workings Both Amelia and Lucy take a minor part in the conversation of their respective circles ; but when the eighteenth century lady has an idea to express , it is spread thin over a deal of space , whereas Lucy accomplishes wonders with half a dozen words and a twist of her expressive brows . Ameba 's life was beset with many trials , and the author sometimes makes us feel that she suffered , for instance when her husband goes to join his regiment . But it should seem that people recovered more easily from great emotional crises in those days , if we may judge from their chroniclers . Did they really take for granted a larger proportion of open wrong in public and private life , so that their nervous systems were unconsciously braced for the ordeal , or were the writers of that period less skilful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggestions . In . any event , let us be thankful that in the old books we are spared the modern clinical studies of morbid conditions , mental , moral , and physical . Surely the laws of morality and social observance are not more frankly broken now , though the psychological effect of wrong or misfortune may be more powerful in this more introspective age May it not be that Meredith goes too far in this direction , overemphasizing the corrosive power of mental and spiritual distress ? After the crisis of Amelia 's trials , she is rapidly restored , and the last years of her life are happy . Lucy 's troubles , on the surface , are not widely dissimilar , but with a greater capacity for mental suffering , and a more complex world about her , she succumbs Here , in spite of the dramatic power and beauty of the closing scenes of her life , is not the older novelist the better artist , though the more conventional one ? Even at the expense of possible inconsistency , would not most readers prefer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the shadow of their wrongs and finally reap the benefit of what life holds of good ? One somehow feels entitled to just rewards and retributions in the story world , and . the conclusion of " Richard Feverel " seems needlessly painful . CORINNE ROCKWELL SWAIN . Philadelphia , November 3 WESTERN RAILWAYS AND FARMING TO THE EDITOR OP THE NATION : " SIR : In the Nation of September 22 an editorial note calls attention to the work certain Eastern railways are doing for the improvement of farming in the districts served by them , and suggests that some Western roads might take a lesson from this Permit me to tell briefly what two Western railways are doing in Oregon and Washington to promote the same end For two or three years the two leading railways of these States have run demonstration trains over their several lines in connection with the two State agricultural colleges . The object sought and the method by which it is sought will best appear from extracts from the announcements of these trains issued by the traffic managers . This , from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1908 : The purpose of this movement is to encourage diversified farming through a continuous occupation of the land . . . It is believed that existing methods can be improved through rotation systems of cropping and the employment of various cultural methods for the conservation of moisture , and the Traffic Department , with the cooperation of the Washington Agricultural College , has organized this course for the benefit of those directly interested in agricultural pursuits A bulletin by the same railway two years later , announcing a train to be run in connection with the Oregon Agricultural College , shows a marked development in the movement , in the amount of time given , in the extent of territory covered , and in the number of subjects presented , with a corresponding increase in the number of men from the Agricultural College and experiment stations accompanying the train as demonstrators and lecturers Among the subjects to be discussed , according to the conditions in each locality , may be mentioned the following Poultry , dairying , horticulture , more and better live stock , chemistry of the soil , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ methods An announcement by the other railway of a similar train showed the equipment furnished by the companies - It will consist of one stock car , one flat car , three large baggage cars , and coaches for the accommodation of the party in charge . The equipment covers in a very thorough manner dairying , pOultry , horticulture , forage crops , soils . The stock-car will carry good and poor dairy cows for demonstration purposes , and first-class beef-type cows , and representative individuals of some of our leading breeds of sheep To these demonstration trains a hearty reception has been given by the people in all sections of the two States They are likely for some years to come to be regarded by the colleges as valuable opportunities for agricultural college extension , and by the railways as an effective means of the intensive development of the country they serve J. FL WILSON Matinee. , Ore , October 29 CALENDAR REFORM IN GERMANY To THE EDITOR 01 ? THE NATION SIR : We have all been confused by the appearance of Christmas on a different week-day each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day of the month each year , by the variable recurrence of school terms , election dates , etc . If the German reformers agree among themselves and then bring the rest of the civilized world to their way of thinking , all these difficulties will vanish . Delegate Pachnike , in the Prussian Abgeordnetenhaus , has already demanded that that body take action on such a reform , and the mathematicians are busy all over Germany with plans for effecting the desired regularity . Ernst von Hesse-Wartegg , in the Kolntsche Volkszeitung , proposes to call New Year 's Day zero ( 0 ) , which will leave the counted days 364 in number and begin each year with the same day of the week Most of the calculators do substantially the same thing , but dispose in various fashions of the additional uncounted day which appears with the leap years . Elsa Koopman , in lifonssinus , suggests that the leap-days be allowed to accumulate for twenty-eight years , and then be disposed of in an uncounted " leap-week. " - She would set her calendar in motion with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1995 , 2023 , etc . She would omit the Sunday as Herr von Hesse-Wartegg proposes , would give January , April , July , and October thirty-one days each , the other months thirty ; would set Sunday , April 14 , as Easter , Christmas for the fourth Tuesday of December , Thanksgiving for the 29th of November . Her January , April , July , and October begin on Monday ; February , May , August , and November on Thursday ; March , June , September , and December on Saturday . It is doubtful whether the standing still of the calendar for a week every twenty-eighth year would not occasion more confusion than the present arrangement . A calendar which accomplishes all that she can claim for hers and would promise to operate with less difficulty , could be constructed as follows ' Apportion the-months as Fraulein Koopman proposes , then begin with a year that comes in on Sunday , as she does-1911 , 1922 , 1928 , etc ? but leave an uncounted day between December and January , and in leap-years another between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Year 's Day and Leap Year 's Day , and thus locate them adequately without numbers . The first month of each quarter begins with Sunday , the second with Wednesday , and the third with Friday A division substantially like this has met with general favor and is possibly the calendar of the future . ROY TEMPLE HOUSE . Magdeburg , Germany , October 22 . " THE STORY OF AL RAOUI . " To THE EDITOR OP THE NATION : SIR : I have been making some investigations which lead me to the conclusion that William Beckford was not the writer of this little work . As the volume is now very rare , I transcribe the title-page of my own copy : The Story of Al Raoui , a tale from the Arabic . Second edition . London : printed by C. Whittliagham , Dean Street , Fetter Lane ; for C. Geisweiler , Pall Mall ; sold also by G. G. and J. Robinson , and H. D. Symonds , Paternoster Row ; J. Richardson , Royal Exchange ; G. C. Keil , Magdeburg ; B. G. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ G. Beygang , Leipzig , 1799 . Svo. pp. 59 . The book is entirely anonymous . The dedication is merely signed , " The Translator . " The volume comprises an English version , " The Story of Al Raoui " ( pp. 10-24 ) , a German version ( pp. 25-44 ) , and Verses ( pp. 45-59 ) . There were two editions issued in the same year . In the catalogue of the British Museum the book is entered under " Raoui , " but in the Dyce and Forster copies at the South Kensington Museum , there are MS. notes attributing it to Beck-ford . In the preface to the first English edition of " Vathek " Henley  --  not Beckford  --  professes that " the original of the following story , with some others of a similar kind , collected in the East by a man of letters was communicated to the editor above three years ago . " Beckford rightly asserted that " Vathek " was not a translation but an original work . In Ouseley 's Oriental Collections , January-Vebruary-March , 1798 ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is a table of contents of Jonathan Scott 's MS. of the " Arabian Nights , " and this includes the " Story of a lover whose mistress was killed by a lion . " This story is printed with the Arabic text in No. iii , July-August-September , 1798 , p. 349 . It is No. 145 in W. F. Kirby 's " Bibliography of the Arabian Nights . " From this we may conclude that the decision to print this version was reached between March and September , 1798 . The story ( which has strong resemblance to the Pyramus and Thisbe theme ) has suffered at the hands of some of the editors and translators . One calls it the history of a courtier , which it is not ; another calls it the history of a courtezan , which is still more inaccurate . Another turns Al Raoui into Al-Kavi . The " Story of Al Raoui " may mean the story of the storyteller or it may mean the story told by the story-teller . ( See Chauvin : ' Bibliographic Arabe , " V @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henley and not Beckford . Dyce and Forster may have been led by the mention of " Vathek " in the preface to regard " Al Raoui " as by the same author . There is another curious point . The Monthly Review for May , .1772 , contains a notice of an anonymous poem entitled " Conjugal Love , " which appeared at Cambridge in 1772 . This stanza is cited : Then in my boys , some lovely maid I 'll woo , Whose virtues and whose form resemble thine ; While in your girls , shall pay his court to you , Some honest youth , whose bosom throbs 1. ke mine . On which the critic quotes a verse from Gilbert Cooper 's " Winifreda " : And when with envy Time transported , Shall think to rob us of our joys ; You 'll in your girls again be courted , And I 'll go wooing in my boys . Now the poem on " Conjugal Love " identified by this quotation , appears on p. 48 of " Al Raoui . " In a prefatory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were long ago printed , but with more defects than their own . They are here annexed for the sake of correcting them . " In 1772 Beckford , who was a boy of thirteen , was not likely to be writing and printing a poem on conjugal love . On the other hand , there is a difficulty in the fact that Henley in that year was out of England . He was then professor of moral philosophy at Williamsburg , Va . He may , however , have sent his MS. to some Cambridge friend , and his distance from the press would per- haps account for the mistakes of which he complains . Could not some one on your side of the Atlantic give information as to the Rev. Samuel Henley 's American career ? At present all that seems to be known is that he printed some sermons while still at the Virginian college . The probability that Henley was the author is very much strengthened , if not made absolutely certain , by the fact that " Al Raoul " was publicly attributed to him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Magazin , EncyclopOdique ( v. ann  --  e , tome 4 , pp. 286-287 ) , by A. L. Millin , who unhesitatingly speaks of " la traduction angloise de ce conte Arabe , par M. Henley . " And Millin liked the story so well that he inserted a French translation of it in the same volume ( p. 343 ) . The reference to this French critique I owe to Professor Chauvin 's remarkable ' Bibliographic Arabe , " and I have to thank his courtesy for a transcript of the article . It is most likely that " Al Raoui " is a result of the Oriental studies of Beckford and Henley , and had remained in the hands of the latter for the sixteen years or so he mentions . This would give about 1783 as the date of composition of the little book . It looks as though Henley , when he knew that another version of the Arabic tale was likely to appear , could not resist the temptation of getting his own out in advance . WILLIAM E. A. AXON .

To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR : Since industrial education means giving a " practical " training for the ordinary man 's life-work , no intelligent man will deny its advantages . Man must earn his bread by the sweat of his brow , and any system of education which does not consider seriously this necessity is valueless . But industrial education does not cover the whole ground of " practical " education . Aman may be an expertmechanic , and yet his skill will not suffice him if he commits murder or theft . In other words , every man is not merely a working animal , but he must be at the same time a social , a political , and a moral animal . This " practical " lesson can be best impressed by the judicious study of the record of human experience in history and literature . Industrial education is a good thing , but not at the expense of liberal education , for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education . The young man who is being trained to skill with his hands should not be deluded into believing that it is all the education he needs . Since the beginning of time there have been thousands of good workmen for every one good thinker ; but progress and civilization are due to the thinkers . Surely progress and civilization are " practical " results . JOHN PATTERSON , University of Louisville , November 1 .
