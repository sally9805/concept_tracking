To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR : No organ of public opinion in American life can boast a nobler record in the fearless utterance of the truth in the championship of the right than the Nation . Perhaps you are in part responsible for the spirit that prompts this ejaculation . Your recent editorials , while fearless and illuminating as ever , have engendered a spirit of protest . They incline me to ask , " Who will show us any good ? " The most prominent political figure in the nation finds it expedient to " play politics " and you apparently throw him into the moral discard . Mr. Daniels , who many think has proven himself a fairly efficient secretary of the navy under trying conditions , you dub " a North Carolinian Cassandra " ( by the way , when did Priam 's daughter change her sex ? ) . Mr. Lansing is merely " a capable diplomatic official , " who is unequal to the demands of the coming peace conference . Mr. Burleson is a " cheap Texas politician . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. Redfield is a " nonentity " while Mr. McAdoo , though not without good qualities , has committed the unpardonable sin of being a temperamental Southerner besides damning himself forever in the eyes of the nation by segregating colored clerks at Washington ( pace spirit of Charles Sumner ) . Republican leaders hardly fare better at your hands . I infer that Mr. Lodge often impresses you as a political snob while apparently only a kind Providence keeps Mr. Roosevelt out of jail . Granting that all this is true , in whole or in part , I submit it is rather discouraging , at all events to those of us who would like to believe that there is good in human nature . Can we not have just a bit less of this high brow pessimism and more of the human note that " makes the whole world kin ? " JNO . M. MECKLIN University of Pittsburgh , November SO The Soul of Flanders By HENDRIK WILLEM VAN LOON OUTSIDE , the wind was blowing a gale . The little hotel , high on top of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storm . The single kerosene lamp flickered and threw uncertain shadows on the old yellow table of the taproom . Through the windows one saw the angry clouds , Valkyrie-like , racing past the pale moon . With some trouble I opened the door and stepped outside . In the dark of the porch , a freezing Dutch sentinel was stamping his feet . He wore a heavy gray coat , and carried his gun under his right arm as if it were a gigantic umbrella . " A cold night , " I said . " A cold night , " he answered . " Anything new ? " I asked . " A few signals from Zeebrugge . A U-boat must be trying to get in . If you wait a moment you will see some fine fireworks . " At the foot of the dunes , the sea stretched toward the lighter horizon , dark as pitch . Where the water met the sand of the shore a faint light of phosphorescent foam moved to and fro . Near us , two uncertain lanterns bobbed violently up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Scheldt . Suddenly , far out toward the West a rocket illuminated the sky . It showed green and then red . On the mole of Zeebrugge a red light burned brightly for a moment , spelling out dots and dashes . Then all was darkness again , and another German submarine crept back into its lair , surreptitiously , like a beast of prey , coming home from its nightly hunt . " That will be all , " said the sentinel , " unless there is going to be another bombing attack " ; and looking at the sky , " It is too stormy for that . It will be a quiet night . " " Tell me , " I asked , " where is the highest point here in the dunes ? " " Right behind the house . But it is very dark and the place is full of barbed wire . What do you want to do ? " " I want to see Flanders sleep , " I answered . " That can be done . Poor Flanders has been asleep now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We followed a narrow path that began a few feet away from the house . " Careful , " the soldier warned me , and in the sudden light of the bare moon I caught the cold gleam of polished steel . An anti-aircraft gun stood there silent and lonely , like a patient horse , waiting the word of its master to come and serve . Then we entered a labyrinth of barbed wire , and after some stumbling in the slippery sand we reached the top of the flat dune . " There , " the soldier said , " there is Flanders . " Over the endless expanse of the flat Flemish land , the night had thrown her merciful cloak . Bruges , Ghent , Ypres , cities of ancient glory and fame , the centre of a world of commerce and art and good cheer  --  centuries before our American continent was dreamed of , they lay there , submerged in the common misery of foreign invasion , while the heavy boots of strange masters stamped the ground where Jan Breidel and Pieter de Coninck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great race had so long slept their last peaceful slumbers . High above our heads a flock of seagulls circled . They shrieked their angry and plaintive wail . Suddenly they were quiet . In the midst of the storm and the noise of the surf , a mysterious beast of the night laughed aloud  --  laughed as if he mocked at all the world  --  then beat his invisible wings and departed for unknown regions . The soldier made ready to go back to his post . " That was the - ghost of Tyl Ulenspiegel , " he said ; " every night at this time he flies across Flanders land . The Germans hate him . They shoot at him . But they can not kill him . He lives forever . " Just then there was a short , sharp click , and from the nearby frontier came the report of a shot .
