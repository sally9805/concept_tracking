txt Would Carry Accrued Liabilities . A far-reaching system of pensions for the support of the clergy , their widows . and their children , is recommended in a report made public to-day by the Joint Commission on the Support of the Clergy appointed by the General Convention of the Protestant Episcopal Church of 1910 to consider the q ittstion of the support of the clergy , including salaries . insurance , annuities , and pensions . To carry out the system of pensions which the commission has worked out it is proposed to ask the church to raise , by general appeal such a sum as will carry on a reduced scale the immense accrued liabilities due to the haphazard and unscientific pension systems of the past . This . the commission holds . could be accomplished in a modest manner by about $3,300,600 . The Church has for many years paid pensions . The total pension and relief disbursement is reported to the commission as aggregating annually $222.008 . The Joint Commission on the Support of the Clergy is of the opinion that the time has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pension expenditure . This budget should be adequate to provide annuities for all aged clergymen , for all disabled clergymen , and for the widows and minor orphans of all clergymen , throughout the entire national Church . Instead of dealing with the parish , the Joint commission recommends that the national Church deal directly with the diocese in establishing its pension system , and that the pension budget be assessed among the dioceses according to the exact liability which the clergy list of each diocese puts that year upon the fund , corresponding to the age at which each of the clergy in the diocese was ordained and the age at which each received an increase in stipend . In recommending that the Church : raise by general appeal the $3,500,000 which it is estimated would carry the accrued pension liabilities of the past . the commission points out that the donors to this fund would be absolutely assured that the appeal would never be repeated . Briefly summarized , the pension syse tern recommended by the commission would provide as follows : An annuity to a clergyman at 65 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his office , based upon his length of service and stipend . The maximum would be 50 per cent . of the average annual stipend , no annuity to be in excess of $3,000 . To the widow of any clergyman an annuity equal to one-half of the annuity to which her husband would have been entitled ? during the years of marriage , with a minimum of $300 provided the marriage was celebrated during his years of active service . Annuities to provide education for the children of a deceased clergyman , as follows : $100 before the age of 7 : $200 between the ages of 7 and 14 ; $300 between the ages of 14 and 21 during dependence , provided that the combined annuities to widow and children are not to exceed the annuity to which the clergyman would have been entitled . This proviso not to apply if the clergyman died before the age of 40 . In case of total disability , certified to by the fund 's own physician , a temporary annuity during the continuance of such disability equal to 40 per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the General Convention approve merely the general principles of the above pension system , leaving the details to be administered under constant actuarial advice and through fixed rules by a permanent Board of Trustees . These Trustees might well be composed of fifteen Bishops , fifteen Presbyters , and fifteen laymen , elected by the General Convention , to represent the entire Church , five of each order to be elected by each General Convention . The Trustees should be authorized to delegate their power , to be exercised under their control . to an Executive Committee of three Bishops , three Presbyters , and three laymen , one of each order to be elected triennially by them . The Trustees should be directed to report to each General Conventien and to be in all respects subject to the authority of the General Convention .
