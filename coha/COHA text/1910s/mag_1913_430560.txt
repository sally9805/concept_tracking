 | When Viscount Haldane , the Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain , comes to the United States next week it will be the second time in the history of the British Empire that a Lord Chancellor has received his sovereign 's permission to cross the Atlantic . A few years ago Lord Loreburn , Viscount Haldane 's predecessor , paid a visit to Canada . In the British " Table of Precedency , " which a witty Frenchman has called the passport to the social heaven , the Lord High Chancellor ranks every dignitary of the kingdom with the sole exception of the Archbishop of Canterbury , the . Primate of All England , who is the spiritual head of the Established Church . On all state occasions the Lord High Chancellor is preceded only by the sovereign , the members of the blood royal , the ambassadors , as the personal representatives of their sovereigns , and the primate . That establishes the high position and dignity of the Lord High Chancellor . The Lord High Chancellor is the custodian of the Great Seal of England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , commissions and many other state documents are not valid until the great seal has been affixt by the Lord High Chancellor , or as he was called by a statute of Elizabeth , the lord keeper , as he was the keeper of the seal . That wonderful and mysterious thing the British constitution , which is not a written document but laws piled upon tradition and custom , tenderly safeguards the emblem of kingly power and authority . Anybody from the sovereign down , with the exception of one man , may leave the kingdom at pleasure , and that one man is the lord keeper . The great seal may never be taken from British soil , and as the seal is theoretically always in the possession of the Lord Chancellor it follows as a matter of course that he can never divorce himself from his trust . But in England there is always a way to obey tradition and yet not to make tradition embarrassing to modern progress . To keep to the strict letter of the law but to enable the Lord Chancellor to cross the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the sanction of the sovereign , to put " the seal in commission , " that is , to appoint deputies to have the custody of the seal and to use it . When Lord Brougham was Lord Chancellor he wanted to go to Germany on a holiday and intended to put the great seal in commission , but when he found that it would cost him about $7000 to untie and retie the yards of red tape before he could get rid of the seal , he abandoned the trip to the Rhine and went to Scotland , where the most remarkable incident in the history of the great seal occurred . Brougham , who was a great lawyer and a man of equally great eccentricities , of course carried the seal with him , and while staying at the palace of the Dowager Duchess of Bedford some of the women to amuse themselves stole into his bedroom and purloined the seal . Brougham was in great distress , but the women set him to searching the house and finally Brougham found his precious seal in a tea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her guests to use the seal to make pancakes . The seal . it should be explained , now made of silver but formerly of copper , consists of two large  | disks hinged together , forming a mold in which the wax is poured , by an official of the Lord Chancellor 's department known as " chaff wax . " It is not unlike a waffle iron , and the Duchess of Bedford and her merry party had great fun making pancakes beautifully embossed with the figure of King William on horseback . But the story leaked out , and the King was so angry that when the Whigs came back into power he stipulated with Lord Melbourne that Brougham should not again be given the office of lord keeper . In the struggle between the people and the Stuarts the great seal played an important part . When Charles I fled London to York , Lord Littleton , the lord keeper , brought the seal with him , and Parliament was in a dilemma . At that time a statute made it high treason punishable with death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great seal , but despite this the Commons directed that a new great seal be made . Later the original seal was surrendered by Charles to Parliament , and the House ordered that it should be defaced and broken . In state the Speaker of the House of Commons attended at the bar of the House of Lords , where the seal was laid on an anvil and a brawny blacksmith smashed it amid the cheers of the Roundheads , the while the Cavaliers looked on in sullen scorn . Curiously enough the Parliamentary seal met the same fate . A few weeks before the execution of Charles I a new seal was ordered made , and then the old seal was broken in pieces by a blacksmith at the bar of the Commons . The great seal met with another strange adventure in the reign of the last of the Stuart kings . When England welcomed William of Orange , James II fled to France , carrying with him the great seal , which he managed to get posession of from the Lord Chancellor by a trick . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the river , thinking that with its loss the machinery of government would be brought to a standstill , but a few days later some fishermen found the seal in their nets and restored it to the proper authorities . There is only one case on record of the great seal having been lost and never recovered , and the incident suggests that they played politics in England a century or more ago in a way that would make the most hardened American polit- ical boss admit how little he knows of the game . When Lord Thurlow was Lord Chancellor in the reign of George IIl , his house was broken into and the great seal carried off . Thurlow went to Pitt , the Prime Minister , and told him the dreadful news , and together they hurried to the King . A meeting of the privy council was immediately summoned , and orders were at once given to have another seal made with the greatest despatch and secrecy , which was done in thirty-six hours . It has always been believed that the seal was stolen by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the seal was stolen Pitt decided to appeal to the country , which the Whigs were trying to prevent , but Parliament can not be dissolved unless the great seal is attached to the sovereign 's proclamation of dissolution , and the Whigs evidently believed that when the loss of the seal was discovered a long time must elapse before a new seal could be ordered and made . Pitt fully believed in the Whig plot , as shown by one of his letters , in which he refers to " a curious maneuver , that of stealing the great seal from the chancellor . " Lord Thurlow took no further chances . During the following eight years that he was Chancellor he always slept with the seal under his pillow . In 1812 the great seal was lost for a few hours . Lord Eldon , the Lord Chancellor , was aroused from his sleep one night by the cry of fire , and his first thought being for the seal he snatched up the box containing it , rushed into the garden and buried it in one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he had buried his precious casket , and for hours there followed an agonizing search . The affair was funny enough to appeal to Eldon 's sense of humor , and he writes to a friend : " You never saw anything so ridiculous as seeing the whole family down the walks dibbling with bits of sticks until we found it . " A new great seal is made with the accession of every sovereign . When the new seal has been engraved the old seal is " demasked " by the sovereign in the presence of the privy council . The sovereign gives the obsolete seal a light blow with a hammer , which leaves a slight mark , and the seal then becomes the perquisite of the last Lord Chancellor in PENDENT August 21 whose custody it has been . In the old days the " purse , " which is supposed to contain the great seal , but does not , a magnificent and gorgeous piece of art needlework , used to be renewed with every session of Parliament , and the old purse was one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less extravagant and a purse lasts until it begins to look shabby . Lord Thurlow was chancellor for a quarter of a century , and during that time Lady Thurlow collected a magnificent set of hangings made from the discarded purses . In addition to being the keeper of the great seal of the United Kingdom , the Lord Chancellor is the presiding officer of the House of Lords , and when he enters the chamber he is escorted by " Black Rod " and followed by the mace and purse bearers . The " purse " is an elaborately ornamented bag which is supposed to contain the great seal and like Mary 's lamb must follow the Lord Chancellor around wherever he goes . As a matter of fact it contains nothing and is merely symbolic of his great authority , and is probably a survival of an age when the lord keeper actually slept with the seal under his pillow , because whoever had the seal had the physical emblem of divine right . Now the Lord Chancellor locks the seal up in a fire and burglar proof safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as the Lord Chancellor 's seat in the House of Lords is called , just as the mace is laid beside him , a tradition that links the past to the present . In the days of the Plantagenets the chancellors were always ecclesiastics , because few laymen were versed in the gentle arts of reading and writing . They were required to preside over the kings chapel ; thus making them in fact the king 's father confessor , so that the chancellor was known as the keeper of the king 's conscience . Their functions at times were curiously diverse . As prelates they were not only the head of the Church , but they were also the chief judicial official of the kingdom ; they were always politicians , in which capacity they performed the functions that now devolve upon the members of the cabinet ; and more than one chancellor was as distinguished in the field of battle as he was noted in statecraft . Every reader  | page deleted  | hairs , " is historic . Wolsey , it is generally believed , is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seal with him when he went out of the country . The seal was too important in the machinery of state ? its use now is merely symbolic , but in those days it was the actual evidence of royal authority ? to be allowed to pass out of the hands of its possessor , and yet Wolsey must go to the Low Countries , and there was no one whom he trusted . He solved the problem by taking the seal with him , but it was one of the counts in the indictment brought against him when his house was falling . The Lord High Chancellor today has nothing to do with the Church , and the king keeps his own conscience . The chancellor is always a lawyer , almost invariably has been a Member of Parliament , and usually he has filled the office of Attorney General or Solicitor General , which means that he is one of the leaders of the English bar , as only men of the first rank are given those posts . The Attorney General is the principal law officer of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up his private practise while in office . He may accept retainers from private clients and appear in court in any case in which the government ? that is , the people ? is not a party to the suit , and his pre-eminence makes him one of the hardest worked and highest paid lawyers in the country . In the United States the Attorney General is always a member of the cabinet , but in England , until a year or so ago , the Attorney General was never admitted to the cabinet . The present Attorney General , Sir Rufus Isaacs , K. C. , was made a member of the cabinet , but it was announced that this was a personal compliment and was not to be regarded as a precedent . The English cabinet is a flexible body and it is optional with the Prime Minister , whom he shall include or keep out . Viscount Haldane never held political office until he was made Secretary of State for War by Sir H. Campbell-Bannerman , and when Lord Loreburn resigned as Lord Chancellor because he was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asquith reformed his cabinet by promoting Lord Haldane from the war office to the woolsack . It will thus be seen that the office is distinctly political . Every premier appoints his own chancellor , who goes out with his chief , but altho the chancellor owes his appointment to the Prime Minister , he takes precedence of him on all state occasions ; altho he may be only a baron , which is the lowest order of the peerage , the Lord Chancellor ranks every duke in the kingdom except royal dukes , that is the blood relatives of the king . Thus the man who yesterday was a commoner , who may not be able to trace his descent back farther than one generation , who has succeeded simply thru his own brains and perseverance , by his elevation to the woolsack may claim the pas over men who can trace their descent in an unbroken line to the Conqueror . It is such things as this that have made England , despite a monarchical form of government , at heart a democracy . The Lord Chancellor is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the judicial committee of the privy council , which in England corresponds to the Supreme Court of the United States ? the court of last resort . He is the official guardian of all infants , idiots and lunatics , he has the appointment of all justices of the peace , and he is a member of the cabinet . For his various duties he receives a salary of $50,000 a year , and when the ministry goes out and he ceases to be Lord Chancellor he receives a pension for life of $25,000 a year , for which he sits as a judge in the highest court . I have termed the Lord Chancellor the presiding officer of the House of Lords , but a more technical and accurate description is " prolocutor of the House of Lords by prescription . " Formerly the Lord Chancellor did not necessarily have to be a member of the house , that is to say , a peer , and the chancellors were often commoners . Now the chancellor is always raised to the peerage when the office is conferred upon him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the House of Lords and entitled to all the privileges of its members . Thus it happens that the Lord Chancellor as the presiding officer not only takes part in debate , which is a privilege denied the Vice President of the United States and by prescription the Speaker of the House  | of Commons , but also votes as a party man on all measures . But the House of Lords is a place where tradition holds sway , and to preserve the tradition that its presiding officer is not necessarily a member of the house , the woolsack , the Lord Chancellor 's chair ? so called ? because it is a large ottoman shaped like a bale of wool and commemorative of an act past in the time of Elizabeth prohibiting the exportation of wool , then one of the chief sources of English wealth ? technically is outside the chamber , and whenever the chancellor rises to address his fellow peers he takes two or three mincing steps to show that he has brought himself within the precincts of the house . While the Lord Chancellor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house , because the House of Lords has no rules except what it makes . A peer does not address himself to the Lord Chancellor as a senator does to the Vice-President or a member of the House of Representatives does to the Speaker , but to the house collectively , and begins his speech with " my lords " and punctuates it with " your lordships . " Nor does a peer speak by the permission of the chancellor . It is the right of any peer to speak , and if two men rise at the same time and both claim the floor and neither is willing to yield , the lords themselves must decide who is entitled . first to be heard . And lastly , the Lord Chancellor , despite his tremendous power , has no more authority to preserve order in the House of Lords than the meanest subject in the king 's dominions . In the House of Representatives if members become unruly the Speaker can summon the sergeant at arms and instruct him to use force if necessary to maintain decorum , members can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the House may see fit . But in the House of Lords , if one noble lord should call another noble lord a nature fakir or even worse , all that can be done to still the tumult of passion is for a peer to move that the clerk shall read a pious exhortation that was adopted nearly three centuries ago . Probably after listening to this quaint appeal , which has not been heard for nearly fifty years , so seldom do the peers forget their manners , no one would further transgress the proprieties of parliamentary debate : " To prevent misunderstanding and for avoiding of offensive speeches when matters are debating , either in the House or at committees , it is , for honor 's sake , thought fit , and so ordered , that all personal , sharp , or taxing speeches be forborne , and whomsoever answereth another man 's speech shall apply his answer to the matter without wrong to the person : and as nothing offensive is to be spoken , so nothing is to be ill taken if the party who speaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the words that might bear any ill construction ; and if any offense of that kind is given , as the House will be very sensible of , so it will sharply censure the offender , and give the party offended a fit reparation and full satisfaction .
