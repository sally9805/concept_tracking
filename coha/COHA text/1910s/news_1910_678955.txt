txt SUFFRAGE GAINS . Less Chance for Growth of the Movement in This Country . permit me to thank you for your editorial article in yesterday 's TIMES entitled . " Woman Suffrage - Setback .

" are some of the chief points in the arguments used by those of us who are opposing the extension of suffrage to women . But we go a step further than you do . and are optimistic enough to believe that the more the principles underlying this whole question are studied and understood the less chance there is of woman suffrage making any further gains in this country . We regard it as more than a mere coincidence that the check to the spread of woman suffrage in this country began in the same yoar that an Association Opposed to the Extension of Suffrage to Women was organized In this State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show , that for fourteen years , or since 1890 , when : suffrage was given to the women of ' Idaho . the Suffragists have failed to make any significant legislative gain in any State , except in a few instances where school suffrage , or the right to vote on tax-paying propositions has been extended to them . Woman suffrage may be gaining a foothold in the monarchical countries over the sea . where forms and conditions of suffrage are wholly different front ours , but here in our Republic it is not gaining as rapidly as its advocates would have us believe .
