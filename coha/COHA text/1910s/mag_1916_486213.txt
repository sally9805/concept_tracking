Lloyd George 's Cabinet , the make-up of which was announced on Monday , is still nominally a Coalition Government . Numerically , the balance of parties in it is held nearly level . But reckoning offices by their importance , not number , the lion 's share has gone to the Conservatives . They have the Foreign Office , the Exchequer , the Colonies , War , and the Navy . In some of the new posts , intended to give fuller control of food and labor , and otherwise better to mobilize the national resources , Liberal or Labor members are found . But the predominance of Conscrvatives in the Government of the new Liberal Prime Minister is indisputable . This may have been due in part to the refusal of some of Asquith 's followers to take office under Lloyd George . But the re-suit is unmistakable It marks a swing away from the Liberal party as it has existed for the past ten years . At the same time the Ministry is coalition to a sufficient degree to prevent the immediate formation of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be expected of the new Government , We presume that more will be expected than it can possibly perform The Premier is a man of marked and versatile ability , is capable of arousing high enthusiasm as well as bitter animosity , and has a driving power possessed by few . If he retains his health , he may fairly be counted upon to energize the working forces of the Government . In particular is foreshadowed legislation curtailing the manufacture and sale of liquor ; with other measures designed to cut down waste , penalize luxury , and heighten efficiency . Along such lines it will be natural for Lloyd George to move with vigor and effect . He will doubtless feel that everything must be made ready betimes for the campaign of 1917 ; and in both husbanding and marshalling the resources of the Empire his energy will have full and fruitful scope . He himself holds no portfolio . He is simply Premier and head of the War Council . It is characteristic of his boldness  --  not to say audacity  --  that he thus undertakes a function @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , could not properly discharge . But in all this matter of a small Cabinet , within the Cabinet , to have sole charge of the conduct of the war , there is need of discrimination , of noting the things which it ought not to attempt to do , and can not if it does . It is well to have responsibility concentrated . Big decisions may have swiftly to be made in this war ; and , as we see in France , the conviction is deepening that the authority to make them must be confided to a small group of Ministers . These men , sitting daily in conference , may also do excellent work in coordinating the various war services , and in preventing delay , doubt , and stagnation . But it would be a mistake to suppose that such a body of civilians can wisely impose their opinion about technical military matters . It would be folly for Sir Edward Carson at the Admiralty to order a sudden and perhaps perilous departure in naval policy . That question must be for Sir John Jellicoe and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Derby , well fitted as he is to be Secretary for War , would be rash in the extreme to disregard the trained judgment of the General Staff or the special views of Gen. Robertson and Gen. Haig . The old Governmental machine may be repaired and speeded up , but it will have , after all , to work with the existing material and under the limitations which inhere in the nature of war-making . David Lloyd George comes to his kingdom at a time of unexampled opportunity . If he succeeds in organizing final victory , he will be the idol of the British Empire . But the possibility of splendid failure will long dog his steps . And in estimating the personal qualities which he will bring to his grand essay of fortune , we have to keep in mind his proved defects as well as his admitted powers . Some of his admirers have lately been speaking of him as " a man who thinks in headlines . " This is a gift not without its dangers . It may , indeed , make Lloyd George an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to Lord Northcliffe , who has been hurling his headlines at Asquith for months . But this very fact ought to warn the new Prime Minister that the big type of newspapers may injure as well as help . And the public man who is always thinking of how his achievements will look in flaring print subjects himself to what is at once a temptation and a peril . Lloyd George has frequently shown a preference for sensational methods  --  that seems to be what is meant by thinking in headlines  --  which would go ill with the great office that he has at last attained . But such is the flexible genius at his command that he may , from now on , choose to figure before his countrymen as the grimly silent Minister wreaking himself upon the saving of the nation . A SIMPLIFIED WAR . It is not enough to say that the downfall of Rumania means the end of a phase in the great conflict . Rumania 's disaster means the end of a phase which began with the beginning of the war . It closes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the attack on Liege and for the Allies with the invasion of Gallipoli . In both instances the motive was a short-cut to victory . In both instances the military shortcut brought in its train political and diplomatic complications which made the military problem infinitely more difficult , which , indeed , probably doomed it to failure in advance . To end the war quickly , and by way of Paris , was the Kaiser 's purpose . It failed within a month at the Marne . To end the war by way of Constantinople was the Allied purpose . It has failed , after nearly two years , at Bucharest . To get at Paris the Kaiser dared the crime of Belgium and brought down on himself the judgment of the world . To get at Constantinople the Allies plunged into the bog of Balkan hatreds and ambitions . But whereas the Kaiser was quick to recognize the defeat of his policy of adventure and to settle down to a humdrum war of defence , the Allies were slow to learn . They cluttered forward from one disappointment to another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal unprepared , but always hoping nevertheless for Germany 's defeat in the Balkans . All that is over . The Balkan possibilities are exhausted . Turkey , Bulgaria , Servia , and Rumania have disposed of themselves or been disposed of . Only Greece remains , and it is no longer possible to conceive that any developments in Greece may change the military aspect in southeastern Europe . If the impossible were to happen and King Constantine should strike hands with the Allies , the puny Greek army could be of little help in overcoming the present overwhelming preponderance of the Central Powers in the Balkans . It is idle to speak of Constantinople or of an invasion of Austria across the Danube . The great Allied problem now is the conservation of the army of Salonica Will that army be able to hold out against the enormous pressure which the Central Powers can now bring to bear ? And if by extraordinary efforts the Allies may succeed in reinforcing Sarrail 's army to the point where it could stand up against an attack of Mackensen , is the effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be given by England through Lloyd George and by France through Briand . The French Premier is credited with being the original champion of the Salonica adventure . Lloyd George likewise has been described as an " Easterner , " as opposed to the majority in Asquith 's Cabinet , which it now appears had no enthusiasm for the Balkan enterprise . But if Lloyd George has succeeded in ousting Asquith , it is to be noticed that London has predicted no change in policy , but only a greater energy in carrying on the war . Briand has received a vote of confidence in Parliament , but 160 Deputies voted against him , a very significant minority for war-times . In other words , the policy of Asquith of indifference to the Balkans has not been abandoned in England , and in France Briand 's policy of active intervention in the Balkans has met with severe opposition . It would be only one more ironic incident in the history of the war if Lloyd George and Briand should now be called on to make the first application of their unquestioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have hitherto stood out . Energy and decision do not always manifest themselves in bold undertakings and a bull-dog persistence in the face of the inevitable . It requires energy and courage to confess a mistake , to admit a defeat , and to try again elsewhere With the failure of all hopes of Constantinople there is no longer any excuse for the efforts and sacrifices which the Allies have expended in that direction . The drain on French resources for the Mediterranean campaign , the strain on English shipping , can hardly be justified by any success now in view . It is now certain that if the Allies are to win the war , it must be done in the west . For the Allies , therefore , the collapse of Rumania , with the possible end of operations in the Balkans , will have this advantage , that it will serve to clear the air , to simplify their problem . Hitherto it has been altogether too complex for their resources , and for many reasons . It has been too complex because the very nature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delicate and involved undertaking requires It has been too complex because the war in the Balkans had to be carried on at the end of a thin and extended line of communications by sea . It has been too complex because military operations were made dependent on a delicate interplay of diplomacy . For all the talk of unity of purpose and unity of front , the Allied leadership has not been equal to the enormous task . This confession may now be made openly at London and Paris , in spite of its strictly non-military implications . It would be the acceptance of a moral defeat . It would give new impetus to enemy taunts about Allied " protection " to Servia and Rumania . But in this very bitter business into which the war has resolved itself moral defeats and enemy taunts and confessed humiliations are part of the day 's work . In the test of grim endurance which the war will henceforth become , the Allies must , above everything else , avoid all dissipation of energy . They must fight on the shortest front they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can get ; and these indications point to the original theatres of war ; for the Anglo-French the western front , and for Russia the present line in the east . In two ways , therefore , the Allies may draw advantage from the defeat of their Balkan hopes . There should be an end to divided councils as between westerners and easterners which have undoubtedly lamed the conduct of the war both at London and at Paris and as between the two capitals . There should be an intenser effort in the west The shipping now devoted to Mediterranean enterprises can largely be restored to the feeding of England and her allies and to the munitioning of Russia . In that inexhaustible reservoir of men the annual yield of recruits is a million and a half , and behind the men there is the determination to go on with the fight to the end All doubts about a separate Russian peace with the Kaiser have been removed . This means that the Allied Governments need no longer spend their energies on diplomacy . The War Offices need no longer wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Governments to negotiate . They can devote themselves with single mind to the grim business of the simplified battlefield . MILITARY REORGANIZATION . What the Nation pointed out weeks ago is now universally admitted the National Guard has collapsed as a result of its service in Texas . Wherever the troops have returned the story is the same . What is happening in Illinois is clearly illustrated by the reenlistments in three Illinois regiments totalling from 2,750 to 3,000 men , who were supposed to take the Federal oath for reenlistment under the Hay act for a period of six years . In the First Infantry 50 officers and 176 men swore in ; in the Second , 49 officers and 322 men , and in the Third Infantry , 53 officers and 341 men . The rest felt that in justice to those dependent upon them they could not risk further border service . With the facts thus granted , what is to be done ? The Senators and Representatives who have just arrived in Washington are utterly at sea . Senator La Follette reports that his daily attacks upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during his campaign for reelection . Senator Borah has already introduced a bill repealing all of the Hay act relating to the militia . But beyond that  --  what ? Superficial thinkers and our professional militarists are saying that this means universal service  --  without , of course , considering either the financial or social cost , or the fact that this would make over the United States into a nation in which militarism dominated everything else Many newspapers are putting forth this idea ; those that do not , confess themselves at a loss , as are our legislators , to make really constructive suggestions . They are baffled not only by the problem of the militia , but also by the total failure to get men to en-list in the regulars Secretary Baker 's re-port shows that the increase in the army is so slight as to be negligible . Obviously , the first thing to do is not to do anything hastily . With this example of the results of quick legislation under great pressure before us , Congress should do now what it should have done a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole situation , to sound public sentiment  --  real public sentiment and not that manufactured by defence leagues and paid press agents  --  and above all else to begin by re-forming and re-constituting the present inefficient regular army . The Nation insisted last winter that no real preparedness could come out of the Hay law , because it was merely building a superstructure upon a rotten foundation . For that we were ridiculed and abused and accused of insulting the army . We reiterate every charge that we made at that time , and we insist that until the regular army itself can be made 100 per cent . efficient , it is useless to talk of adding more men To this end the first step would be a rigid investigation of the army as at present constituted and administered , if only to cut out the enormous waste of funds , and to bring about the introduction of business methods and ordinary , every-day military efficiency ; some system by which men shall be held responsible for the effectiveness with which they work . To-day no army officer is ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any ordinary clerkship . No colonel is ever punished no matter how unmilitary his regiment may be . The whitewashing of the Thirteenth Cavalry at Columbus proves that . Granting that because of our prosperity no worse time to induce men to enlist could have come to pass , the fact remains that there is still something radically wrong with the army when it can enroll in the face of our Mexican troubles and all the preparedness excitement only 2,667 men in October , 1916 , as against 2,466 in October , 1915 , and 3,493 in October , 1911 This year much more money was spent on the recruiting service and far greater efforts were made by additional stations , liberal advertising , motion pictures , etc . At the same time the Marine Corps , militarily far more efficient than the army and offering about the same rates of pay , is able to keep its ranks full . What the army needs is to be turned into a training school out of which men can get something more than military drill . More than one army officer believes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should teach trades to a vastly greater extent than now . Increased pay there will doubtless have to be . Here , in the reorganization of the regulars , is our first constructive task . Another is the strengthening of the home army itself by bringing from abroad regiments now stationed overseas , whose position frequently suggests considerations other than purely military Why should regular regiments be wasted in Hawaii , Porto Rico , Alaska ? Hawaii can be defended only by the fleet ; if the fleet is defeated , the islands are bound to be cut off . Had the cavalry and infantry regiments now there and in the Philippines and at Panama  --  where there are the best coast defences we have  --  been withdrawn and put into Texas , the necessity of calling on the whole of the National Guard would never have arisen  --  always provided that the Mexican border had been efficiently patrolled , as a competent police force or constabulary would have patrolled it . Again , in the development of a constabulary as efficient as that in Pennsylvania or the Philippines lies another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the selv eral States . With a constabulary at hand for ordinary breaches of the peace or mob-violence one bar to enlistment in the militia would be removed But first and foremost should be the restoration of the National Guard to its former position as a purely State organization . It can still be made a vastly more effective body than it ever was if the spectre of Federal control passes ; the steady growth in efficiency of the New York and Massachusetts troops proves that . The difficulty was that when the preparedness mania was yielded to we would not wait for the slow processes of reorganization to continue We had to have a second line in service within thirty days . Now , many think that we can get that reserve and a fighting force within thirty days if only we turn to conscription . It took 115 years to bring the German army up to its present efficiency , but that we overlook . Fortunately , there are plenty of signs besides Senator La Follette 's and Mr. Bryan 's testimony that the American people do not wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem that confronts Washington is one to challenge constructive statesmanship of the highest order . WHAT AN EXECUTIVE BUDGET MIGHT DO . As the Government expenditures mount year by year , the question of dealing with them in the most efficient way becomes more important ; and there are many signs that the executive budget plan is slowly gaining e round . The departmental estimates by Secretary McAdoo run slightly over a billion and a quarter ? $1,268,715,000 . This sum no longer startles ; for a year ago the estimates reached the total of $1,285,857,000 . But a mere glance at the figures is a reminder that the totals for 1916-17 and 1917-18 are so large that we should be anxious to see estimates carefully laid out and ways and means carefully canvassed . Two years ago the total appropriations amounted to only $1,115,120 , - 000 , and three years ago to but $1,094,000 , - 000 ; while to go back a few years more is to find them well under a billion . It is , of course , true that the executive budget would ? despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three hundred millions a year  --  by no means offer hope of epoch-making reductions Such new items as those for increased national defence , which come to about $750,000,000 this year , would expand the national outlay under any system But we might avoid serious wastes and extravagant Congressional practices . " I believe , " remarked Representative Fitzgerald recently , " that the time will come when the power to initiate money bills must be taken from the individual . . . . I believe this is inevitable if the Federal Government is not to break down with the weight of expenditures . " Mr. Fitzgerald is typical of a number of Congressmen who have turned from opposition to the budget to advocacy of it . It may be said that all recognize that it is coming , but that most of its opponents wish to postpone it . Nearly all recognize at heart that it is unfortunate that Secretary McAdoo 's " Book of Estimates " should fall into general neglect in Congress and out ; and that his estimates , after being divided among nine House committees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and provisions for private or sectional spoils . With the executive budget , carefully prepared by the departments and reported by President or Treasury as a final programme for the year , it would be impossible for Congressmen , or influences working through Congressmen , to increase the sums listed or add new items ? only reduction or elimination would be allowed . The preparation of the budget and necessity of careful adherence to it would result in definite departmental economies , as would also a new supervision which would be possible over unexpended balances . The expenses and resources of Government would be more carefully coordinated . It is not strange that President Taft and the Economy and Efficiency Commission gave all their weight to the plan ; that President Wilson was largely instrumental in the careful consideration of it by Representatives Sherley 's and Fitzgerald 's committees , and that bodies like the United States Chamber of Commerce have declared emphatically for it . It is true that most Government officers no longer pad their estimates as a precaution against the blue pencil ; that the Treasury has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that heads like Assistant Secretary Newton of the Treasury , in charge of public buildings expenditures , are veritable watch-dogs Yet nine-tenths of the 6,000 bills introduced in the first days of the last session of Congress were private pension bills or like measures . Although in 1914 and 1915 the War Department had received $20,000,000 and $30,000,000 for expert expenditure on the rivers and harbors , last summer a regular " pork-barrel " containing $42,000,000 rolled through . The existing waterways projects , calling for $300,000,000 , promise much additional waste unless we arrange soon for both the budget and expert direction of the money voted . The Public Buildings bill , carrying $30,000,000 , was happily sidetracked , but it may again be hustled through . Public buildings still offer striking examples of waste . A recent allowance of $185,000 for a Federal building at Evanston , Wyo. , is regarded as the most shocking bit of pork yet distributed , and the scandal regarding the $169,000 site for the Seattle post office is of recent date . Opportunity for all sorts of influences to bring undue pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  can be cut oft in only one way . The executive budget plan would throw a new responsibility upon our departments , with their too swiftly changing personnel ; and its details would have to be worked out with care . A great range of the current expenses of Government it would not affect at all ; and it would not obviate the necessity of still spending for waterways and court houses , army posts and navy yards , pensions and special claims . But it would treat our financial affairs as all other great Governments treat theirs . Before President Wilson 's second Administration is far advanced , we hope to see him pressing for an executive budget . PIONEERS OF STANDARD OIL . With the death of John D. Archbold passes the last but one of the sub-architects in what is still the greatest product of American constructive genius outside of the sphere of government  --  the Standard Oil Company . The founder of Standard Oil , at the age of seventy-seven , has outlived nearly all of the younger men whom he called , not so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which he was the inventor . This notable group comprised Archbold , J. A. Bostwick , H. M. Flagler , William Frew , Shephen V Harkness , Charles Lockhart , Daniel O'Day , and H. H. Rogers . These men demonstrate the solution by John D. Rockefeller of one of the most difficult problems in any field of human enterprise , namely , the harnessing of strong individualities to harmonious action in behalf of a common cause . Standard Oil escaped the usual fate that overtakes a Ministry of all Talents , or a General Staff of strong men The enormous success of the company was due in a measure that can not yet be appraised to the efforts of men who , satisfied with the substantial rewards of their labors , were content to work in comparative anonymity , with the result that Standard Oil and Rockefeller have become synonymous . These substantial rewards , to be sure , were of such dimensions as to encourage loyalty to the common cause . But money will not altogether appease the striving for power and distinction The fact that there have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ranks of Standard 011 is a greater tribute to the genius of Rockefeller than the mere size of his personal fortune . This , indeed , was the purpose from which the Standard Oil Company was born . To use the name of a contemporary organization whose aims could not imaginably be further apart from those of Mr. Rockefeller in the early 70 's , Standard Oil was a Fellowship of Reconciliation . It was created to do away with competition in the oil fields . In its beginnings it was not strong enough to impose itself on the producers and refiners in the oil fields It won them over by patience and substantial persuasion . J. D. Archbold was one of the most bitter opponents of Mr. Rockefeller 's unifying schemes as they first took shape in the formation of the South Improvement Company in 1870 , but in 1873 he had Joined the combination , and he was one of the strong men of the company when Standard Oil was organked in its classic form nine years later . Of these men Miss Tarbell has written : Unquestionably the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was founded , as it is to-day , was the men who formed it However sweeping Mr Rockefeller 's commercial vision , however steady his purpose , however remarkable his insight into what was essential to the realization of his ambitions he would never have gone far had he not drawn men into his concern who understood w hat he was after and knew how to work for it His principle concerning men was laid down early : " We want only the big ones , those who have already proved they can do a big business As for the others , unfortunately they will have to die " The scheme had no provision for mediocrity  --  nor for those who could not stomach his methods The men who in 1882 formed the Standard alliance were all from the foremost ranks in the petroleum trade , men who without question would be on top to-day if there had never been a Standard Oil Company Miss Tarbell might have added that these men brought to Standard 011 not only the habits and prestige of success , but the impetus of youth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foundations of the company . Daniel O'Day , one of the strong men of the company , was under thirty when he brought his genius to the task of mobilizing the transportation and pipe-line monopoly of Standard Oil Archbold was twenty-five when he entered the Rockefeller alliance . The youthfulness of these men when the beginnings of Standard Oil were laid will account for the fact that only within the last few years have they been vanishing from the scene But the marvellous rate of growth of Standard Oil is itself the principal reason why a life of less than seventy years , like that of Archbold , should have spanned an entire epic . For something of an epic grandeur unquestionably adhered to Stand ard Oil , whether we regard it as the creation of individual talent or as the expression of America 's unbounded energy and resources . The first formal dissolution of the Standard Oil Trust was effected nearly twenty-five years ago . Governmental investigation of Mr. Rockefeller 's activities began in 1879 . Usually when we speak of a popular fight against a great evil , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past , of a populace battling against the despotism of centuries . But the monopoly which a committee of the New York Legislature and other States set out to investigate in 1879 was just nine years old , and the Trust which was dissolved in 1892 under Federal pressure was a little over twenty years old . It will be a fascinating problem for some future historian of Standard 011 ? or the task may be undertaken by the biographer of any one of its strong men aside from Mr Rockefeller  --  to attempt an appraisal of what credit for the growth of Standard Oil must be apportioned to the founder himself and how much to the men whom he gathered around him .
