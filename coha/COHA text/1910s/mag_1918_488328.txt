- 1- 1HIS northland of ours has an ill name for bleakness and cold , not altogether undeserved . The traveller , who . des only the frowning coast , would never believe that the Irovince hides within its breast the secret of the Happy ' alley . In truth , it contains many valleys of unbelievable , beauty , but the Happy Valley is the queen of them all . Two long ramparts of rock close it in and fence it from the bitter north , the blighting east , and the chill drifting sea-fogs . From North Mountain to South Mountain it measures some fifteen miles across at its widest ; and from end to end it is some eighty miles long . Sheltered from the cold winds , the rich alluvial soil of the Valley lies open to all the fructifying influences of the seasonable suns . It is marvellously productive . Flowers and fruits of lower latitudes flourish here ; acacias and cherry trees which elsewhere are little more than tall shrubs tower here into arboreal giants mighty in girth and limb . All along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ours is a great , wide country , " offering prospects which contradict vulgar mensuration . On the forest-clad crest of North Mountain there is a clearing , a Pisgah height , whence a great stretch of the Valley may be seen at a glance . You may roam the world over and never find its mate . Spread below the traveller 's feet is a smiling land , a land literally of milk and honey . It is a northern Punjab , a country of five rivers all running one way , side by side , among the low waves of the land . Each has its own musical name , and three of the five are French . They disembogue into a huge tidal basin at the traveller 's left hand . Where the shores and banks are visible , they are of red earth , as are the long ribbons of road which wind across the landscape , up hill and down dale . Elms and alders and willows trace the meanders of the water-courses . Here and there are little compact hamlets , each with its white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thickly sprinkled amid the well-cultivated fields and bosoming orchards . It is a soft , domesticated country , richly green even in hot summer , for rain is plentiful , owing to the nearness of the sea . There are no harsh features , no piled rocks , no jagged outcrops . The stony skeleton of the land is well hidden . Even the slopes and summits of the two parallel " mountains " are padded with forest . The lines are long and horizontal . The main roads , here called " streets , " run lengthwise the Valley . But it is the orchards which give the land its character . These tamed forests of fruit-bearing trees clothe the gentle slopes of the rolling country in every direction . There are old orchards , with sturdy if writhen limbs ; there Ire stripling orchards which have not come to their full stature ; and there are baby orchards of newly planted saplings , which make cobwebby patterns of crossing lines in the distance . In all the charm is their formality . They are drilled armies of trees keeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordained . They have the impressive regularity of massed battalions , and represent man 's success in obeying heaven 's first law  --  which is order . They smother the farmhouses , leaving only the roofs and chimneys visible ; they crowd up to the streets of the littletowns . They are inescapable . For the rest , the landscape is a chess-board of rectangular fenceless fields , red from the plough or green with the growing crop . Here and there are patches of woodland which husbandry has not yet attacked . If the traveller descends from his coign of vantage on Pisgah and comes to learn the Valley farm by farm , he will find them so many object-lessons in careful cultivation . This fruit-farming is of a rare cleanliness . No sign remains of the early pruning . The ground between the rows of trees is ploughed and planted . Insect pests are fought with scientific methods . Nowhere about the big farmhouses and bigger barns would the traveller find waste or litter . No cattle run at large on the " streets . " It is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into one billowing , white nosegay . With the warm suns and the soft rains the leaves push forth in little gray-green puffs along the rough bare branches ; and then before they have attained their growth the blossoms follow and smother the green . In the distance , orchards in bloom seem powdered with white . The single'tree viewed close at hand is a dazzling mass of snowy petals . " White is my love as the apple-blossom , " sang the Welsh bard centuries ago . The purity of the color suggests the coolness of an unpolluted spring , the seld-seen white of a young virgin breast . Sometimes it is rased faintly with pink , a delicious intensifying of both colors . A few orchards show pink rather than white . All diffuse a clear , elusive perfume . The Valley in the spring , " a hundred miles of apple-blossom , " as one lover called it , is an unalloyed delight . The recrudescence of Nature worship in a Puritan community might be seen in the local institution of " Blossom Sunday . " When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Valley to-feast their eyes . Even though it is largely an affair of the railroad and the hotel-keepers , the rise of the festival testifies to the drawing power of natural beauty . This latest spring was sheer magic . A fortnight in May made credible all that the poets have sung about the mother of months . Day of beauty followed day of beauty with unfailing regularity . Little rain fell , but still enough to keep the whole countryside in the first fresh flush of green . When the sun was low in the morning and evening , the level rays shot the grass with emerald flame . Warm friendly airs drifted little white clouds across the infinite blue . All the malice of the long , hard winter had been expended ; and now the wayward climate made divine amends for its former cruelty . The kindly time seemed to be Nature 's denial of death , repeating the promise that every winter would change to spring . There was something mystical , portentous in such lavish pouring forth of loveliness . It was as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out its arms wistfully and wooing humanity to its bosom . Some infinite yearning whisper seemed always on the point of making itself heard , had one only the ears to hear . If some divine face had shaped itself in mid-heaven , or if Demeter herself had appeared beneath the orchard boughs , the wonder could hardly have been greater . All along the Valley , the sweet , snowy apple blossoms broke forth before their time , like a light within a light . The bees soon found them out , and ' began to lay in stores of the light-hued delicate honey for which the region is famous . Then came the deflowering winds and scattered the petals like snowflakes on the grass at the foot of every tree . The first glory of the Valley had passed for a year . The growth of the apple in its green bower is not a matter of observation . Summer passes while the fruit swells and shapes undistinguished in color from the green leaves which shelter it . Autumn shows the perfect ruddy-gold globes , ripe , glistening , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Half a million new barrels with white , clean-smelling staves will be needed to contain the crop . Through September the pickers are busy with ladder and basket ; and the buyers  --  the Elizabethan " engrossers " ? travel from orchard to orchard offering so much per barrel on the tree . What is intended for the foreign market is conveyed to special storehouses , where it can be kept unimpaired for months . Here the apples are carefully picked over and graded . The temperature is regulated so that they will neither rot nor freeze . The prices on the London market are carefully watched , and when they reach the right figure , the sluices of the storehouses are opened and streams of apples are released to flow by rail and steamer across the sea . Sometimes the freighter meets the submarine , and the good apples of Ultima Thule strove leagues of ocean to the profit of no one . II Rarely has the artistry of Nature combined with man 's handiwork in happier measure than in this orchard country . Nature supplied plan , outline , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South Mountain was the original coast ; some convulsion of earth 's crust heaved up the long hill called North Mountain from the ocean bed , thus pushing out a second coast line . Fed by their springs the five rivers moulded the land between these two sheltering walls ; and for countless ages , the restless tides sculptured the crumbling shores . Unfruiting forest covered the face of the land . After empty centuries the white man found the Valley out . He cleared away the forest , he built him houses which clustered into little towns ; he planted fruit trees ; he ploughed and sowed and reaped the harvest ; he fought the inroads of the tides . By the labor of his hands , in the sweat of his face , Man the Tireless altered the whole aspect of the wild , beautiful land , until it has become what the gazer sees from his Pisgah , a choice place of human habitation , where poverty seems to be abolished and modest prosperity has fixed her abode . Nor does the Happy Valley lack the supreme charm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This great , sheltered garden is illumined by the Lamp of Memory . For this is part of the lost French province of Acadie , the scene of the forgotten national tragedy , which the genius of the New England poet has made classic ground . On yonder bare field stood the village of Grand Pre , a spot which draws pilgrims every year for Evangeline 's sweet sake . The site is a desolation . There is the spring from which the village drank . At one side stand a few exotic willows . A rude cross of cemented stones has been erected by modern , piety as a memorial of things done long ago and ill done . Grand Pre stood on the low land to which the Acadians clung ; behind is the hilly ground , beyond the desolation of the marsh lands . The French made two contributions to the beauty of the land , the willow and the dyke . The willow is not indigenousto Ultima Thule . It was brought in by the habitants , who settled beside these water-courses in the seventeenth century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this tree as the emblem of the Acadian race . It loves the water and grows best beside the streams . It is persistent and hardy ; if lopped and polled , it sends up fresh shoots in great abundance . Though not native to this land , it is now firmly rooted in it , and is not to be moved out of its place . The symbolism is complete . The second monument to the vanished habitant is the dyke , or aboiteau . Following the river channels and holding back the tides are long , low green ramparts like some strange system of fortifications . There is only one way to build a dyke , of brush and earth , as the engineers of railway bridges in the Valley have found to their cost . No other barrier will resist the unwearied siege of the tide , the onset of the flood , the drag of the ebb . The advantage of the dyke is plain . In place of profitless drowned lands , the community gains large tracts of richest crop soil . The habitants from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keen New Englanders who replaced them bettered their instruction and reclaimed still larger areas by bolder methods . There they lie redeemed from the sea , the huge levels of the marsh lands , which complement the smiling orchard country with the eternal note of sadness . They are featureless and houseless like the sea ; they have the monotony and the melancholy of the sea . Like the sea , they are continually swept by the wind ; even in the hottest days of the summer , there is always a breeze across the dykes . Longfellow never saw the land he made so famous , though he talked of it with an Ultima Thulian attending Harvard . As a consequence , he laid emphasis on the wrong things , such as the forest primeval with which the habitant meddled very little . If , instead of the murmuring pines and the hemlocks , he had put the desolation of the level , windswept marshland into his hexameters , he would have attained to greater truth and deeper pathos . It is in truth a land fit to inspire poets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tears . It has inspired three others . That they are " minor , " and two , at least , little known , is nothing against the argument . The inspiration may be sincere , even if the resultant verse be little worth . A poet is often " minor " because his reach exceeds his grasp . F. J. Herbin has written the best handbook on Grand Pre . He is of Acadian descent , with a keen historic sense . It is through his zeal that the stone cross was reared on the site of the vanished Acadian hamlet . His " Marshlands , " while open to criticism on the score of technique , has the great merit of transcribing faithfully from , the local scene and the local life . " Low Tide on Grand Pre " was Bliss Carman 's first volume of verse , and , in my humble judgment , his best . It revealed an authentic singing gift and rare powers of suggestion . It does not touch the historic ; but it is pervaded by the nameless , indefinable yearning striving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Was it a year , or lives ago We took the grasses in our hands , And caught the autumn flying low ? is a characteristic expression of the poet 's dominant mood . The third is Bernard Trotter . He was brought up amid these scenes and felt their compelling charm . His father was president of Acadia and he himself was destined to the scholar 's life . But the war broke out ; the clear call came to him ; he went to France , and he was killed last year . Like McCrae , he left his country a slender legacy of verse . " A Canadian Twilight " has not the classic perfection of the deep-hearted lyric , " In Flanders Fields " ; but last year it was quoted and copied everywhere because it embodies the feelings of our generous youth and the brave , sad tale of the Canadians in the gap before Ypres with the gray-coat enemy coming in like a flood during the last days of April , 1915 . " They jeoparded their lives to the death in the high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He served the Good Cause , and he fell asleep on the bed of honor in that service . " Nothing is here for tears . " Thus the Happy Valley has not lacked its sacred poets . " Beauty is still immortal in our eyes . " The influences which went to form these three singers have lost none of their potency . They will inspire poets to come . Moreover , the songs of these three will enter subtly into the loveliness they celebrate , and will enhance its all-compelling , never-failing charm . .
