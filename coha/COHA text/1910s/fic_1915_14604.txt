AS the curtain slowly rises the broad entrance hallway of a luxuriously appointed residence is disclosed . The porch without is faintly seen through the wide door whose beveled glass panel is covered with fine lace . Directly opposite this street entrance the broad stairway mounts to the floors above . In back , a short section of the wall , on which is an imposing bronze-shield clock , divides the open spaces of two handsomely decorated rooms that extend beyond : the one at the left is obviously a reception-room ; the other , partly hidden by the stairway , is the dining-room . In the niche , made by the stairs and the wall at the right , a cozy corner is visible in which is tucked a small settee accessible to the ' phone on a low table . The hall-way itself is of the finest paneled wood , here and there supporting electric clusters now unlighted . It is , of course , simply furnished , though there are several long low attractively carved chests which stand against the visible and invisible walls . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rugs on the hardwood floor . The entire impression is of studied simplicity made possible by great means . Though it is late afternoon  --  the hands of the clock , in fact , indicate a quarter to five  --  the sun still pours in sufficiently through the glass door and the windows suggested in the extreme rear to light the hallway . For some moments no one is seen . Then POLLY comes from the dining-room , looking for her " Alice in Wonderland . " POLLY is about six or seven . She is dressed in a neat frock and her hair is tied with a ribbon which sets off her thoughtful face . She is rather a winsome body , with a quaint attractive charm all her own . She finds the book on one of the chests and slowly goes up the stairs looking at the pictures . Then she is no longer seen . A few seconds after this , the figure of a woman is indistinctly observed outside trying to look in through the street door . She hesitates a moment ; then a key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door almost stealthily and stands there . She absently pushes the door to as though fearing one might see her and , not knowing what to do with the key , places it in her handbag . It is KATRINE BANNING . KATRINE is about thirty . The thin outlines of her delicate face quickly reveal a woman of natural refinement and her general manner indicates assured social position . At present her large deep eyes are narrowed with suppressed excitement , her frail body quivers with alert attention ; she seems tuned to a purpose . One intuitively gains a sense that she is not naturally self-willed , but has been made so by overwhelming circumstance  --  a woman determined but unused to the pervading emotion which is now impelling her life . She is quietly gowned . She gains control of herself , and after looking about the room for a moment as though it recalled many things , her eyes finally rest on the stairs . She slowly moves toward them  --  hesitating , gaining courage , and finally confident . As she is about to ascend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quivers . Instinctively she retreats into the reception-room as she hears the outer dining-room door open and close . With a quick glance in that direction , she conceals herself in back as JOHN , the butler , in conventional garb , enters from the dining-room . As he goes to the ' phone KATRINE steps out and listens , though she can not be seen by the butler because of the intervening stairs . JOHN ( At the ' phone ) Hello ? This is John . Beg pardon , Mr. Banning ; at half-past five ? ( KATRINE starts and quickly glances at the clock . ) Very good , sir . Early dinner I 'll tell cook Yes , sir Anne has just brought Miss Polly in . She 's upstairs . Very good , sir . ( JOHN hangs up the receiver . He is about to go when he notices a draught and looks at the street door , which , during this , has blown open . As he crosses to close it KATRINE again retreats out of sight . JOHN becomes somewhat suspicious , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . KATRINE , thinking he has gone , comes out and starts quickly toward the stairs . JOHN steps out , also , in front of her . He is civil but suspicious throughout. ) p. 3 JOHN I beg pardon . Do you wish to see Mr. Banning ? KATRINE You do n't know me ? JOHN No , ma'am . KATRINE Oh , yes ; you 're new here . JOHN Some months . KATRINE That explains it . JOHN ( As she again starts to go up ) I beg pardon ; perhaps you 've got the wrong house . KATRINE ( Cynically ) The wrong house ? JOHN ( Firmly ) Mr. Banning 's very particular and I must be  --   --  KATRINE ( Realizing his suspicions )  --  careful ? Yes . One must be careful these days . JOHN Will you leave a card ? KATRINE You might call Anne . JOHN ( Surprised ) You know Anne ? KATRINE ( Pointing to the push-button ) Press the button three times . It 's her call , I believe . Then stay here till she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) I beg pardon if I 've made a mistake . KATRINE You are quite right to be careful  --  with a child upstairs . JOHN Thank you . KATRINE I forgot I was a stranger here . ( She begins to laugh nervously , much to his amazement . ) Me  --  a stranger here ! JOHN I beg pardon , but  --   --  KATRINE I told you , you did quite right . JOHN ( Points to reception-room ) Wo n't you wait in there ? KATRINE ( Abruptly ) Is that clock right ? JOHN A trifle slow . KATRINE Oh , yes ; it never was on time . ( As she begins laughing again nervously , ANNE enters in back , completely astonished on seeing KATRINE . ANNE is about sixty , with white hair and a kind face . She is dressed in black with a white frilled cap . ) ANNE Miss Katie ! KATRINE Anne . p. 5 ANNE Oh , good Lord ! It 's Miss Katie herself ! KATRINE Mr. Banning 's new butler thought me a thief . ANNE A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beg pardon , but the front door was open and no one  --   --  KATRINE ( Impatiently ) Tell him , Anne . So he 'll know me if I call again . ANNE It 's Mrs. Banning ! JOHN ( Astonished ) Mrs. Banning ! Oh , I beg pardon . ( Recovering himself . ) Mr. Banning will be here himself at half-past five . KATRINE ( Glancing at the clock ) Yes , I know . I heard you . ( ANNE motions JOHN to go . He leaves quietly in back ; then ANNE , her manner changed to one of extreme solicitude , goes to KATRINE , who is seated on the chest laughing nervously . ) ANNE You 'll have hysterics . KATRINE ( Bitterly ) Think of a mother having to steal into the house to see her own child ! p. 6 ANNE Hush ! Hush ! He frightened you . KATRINE ( Controlling herself ) I have n't given way like this once  --  since it all happened . ANNE ( Quieting her in a motherly fashion ) There now , Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , yes  --   --  KATRINE I thought Polly might be alone ; or only with you . I did n't want any one else to see me . I had my old key . She 's upstairs ? ANNE ( Hesitating ) Yes . KATRINE ( Looking at the clock again ) Then I can see her , before Mr. Banning comes . ANNE ( Glancing quickly up toward the stairs , fearing POLLY may hear ) Is it best to see her now ? KATRINE Anne ! She 's not getting used to my being away from her ? ANNE It was n't easy for her at first ; but Mr. Banning told her  --   --  KATRINE ( Sharply ) What did he tell her ? Say it , Anne . p. 7 ANNE That you 'd gone away on a long trip , and would n't be back for a long time . KATRINE Did he say anything unkind about me ? ANNE I never hear him speak about you . KATRINE Then you think Polly does n't know what has happened ? ANNE Ah , Miss Katie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . KATRINE ( Starting toward the stairs ) I must go to her if only for a few moments . ANNE ( Half stopping her ) Miss Katie  --   --  KATRINE You stop me , too ? ANNE It 's breaking my old heart , Miss Katie , to see you taking on like this ; but she 'll tell Mr. Banning and he gave me particular orders  --   --  KATRINE ( Abruptly ) To shut me out ? ANNE ( Lowering her head ) He might send me away . KATRINE Oh , yes  --  yes . ( She sits again , slowly , as though overcome with perplexity ) p. 8 ANNE Mr. Banning is so changeable-like these last months . There 's no telling what he 'll do . KATRINE She must n't lose you . ANNE He says she needs a woman about and that he 's trusting her to me now . KATRINE To you ? Yes ( Half breaking )  --  and my arms are empty . ANNE He never smiles ; even when he 's loving her . KATRINE He loves her ? Does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you 'll pardon me , Miss Katie , it seems as though you both love her more since this took place . KATRINE We both love her : yet the courts gave her to him . ( Dully ) They could n't understand . ANNE ( With a sigh ) If people do n't understand us and they 're stronger , there 's nothing to do but give in to them . KATRINE ( Rising impulsively ) But I have not given in ! ANNE Do n't we all have to in the end ? KATRINE ( With a certain imperative firmness ) No : not inside  --  not in our hearts and souls . I 'm her mother : she 's my girl . I 'm wasting time . p. 9 ANNE You 're going to see her ? KATRINE Upstairs or here . ANNE But if Mr. Banning should find out ? KATRINE He 'll never know I saw you . You wo n't be blamed . Send her down here for a book or something . Do as I tell you . ( Clutching ANNE 'S @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever since I was her age . Do you think I am not even fit to see her ? ANNE No , no , Miss Katie . Only I ca n't believe it 's all true  --  when everything was so nice and comfortable here for you . I ca n't believe it 's true . ( ANNE goes upstairs shaking her head . ) KATRINE ( Half to herself , surveying the room slowly ) Everything so nice here ! ( She goes quickly to the door , after glancing at the clock which is now pointing to five . ) A half hour . ( A thought strikes her and she goes , with suppressed excitement , to the ' phone . ) Hello ? Plaza 4433 . ( She waits nervously . ) Yes , Sheldon 's ? Send me a taxi at once . Banning . Yes 34 Park . At once I am waiting . ( As she is ' phoning , POLLY comes slowly down the stairs , not knowing who is talking . Finally when she reaches the bottom she and her mother recognize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rushing eagerly to her arms ) Mama ! Mama ! ( KATRINE hugs and kisses her repeatedly for some moments as though words could not break through her inarticulate emotion . ) KATRINE Polly ! My little girl ! Dearest ! POLLY You 've come back ? KATRINE Yes , yes . POLLY I 'm so  --  so glad ! Do n't cry , mama . KATRINE I ca n't help it , dearest . Ah , you look so well , so pretty . You 've grown , my darling  --   --  POLLY I 'm so glad you 're home again . ( KATRINE looks down , trying to keep back the tears . ) Did you have a nice trip ? KATRINE Oh ! POLLY Where have you been ? KATRINE ( Controlling herself ) I 've been far away . Did n't your father tell you ? POLLY Papa said he 'd tell me all about it some day . But why did n't you come to tell me about it before you went away ? And you did n't kiss me good-by. p. 11 KATRINE I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . POLLY Why did n't you wake me up ? KATRINE It 's best sometimes not to waken happy children . POLLY But you 've come back to stay with us now ? KATRINE ( Evasively ) You 've missed me ? POLLY Yes . I 've been so lonesome . KATRINE But you had your father . POLLY ( With childish mirth ) Oh , yes ; and he 's such fun these days . He said he must be papa and mama to me while you 're away . He plays with me every time I ask him now . He was always " too busy " before . We sailed boats in the bath-tub yesterday and he got his coat all wet . Will you sail boats with me ? KATRINE Yes . POLLY Papa says he 's going to take me on a real boat soon . KATRINE A real boat ? POLLY Yes . A boat that goes over the ocean . KATRINE ( Half terrified ) He 's going to take you over the ocean ? p. 12 POLLY Yes . When Spring comes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while . I told Anne , maybe we were going over to find you . But now you 've come back , we can all go together . ( Happily ) Wo n't it be fun ? KATRINE ( Nonplussed ) Next month ! POLLY I 'm getting all my things . Anne 's having them made for me . And I 've got a red hat with a long feather . Come , see it . ( Taking her hand and trying to drag her to the stairs ) KATRINE ( Holding her close again ) He sha' n't take you ; he sha' n't . POLLY But , mama , I want to go . KATRINE You want to go ? POLLY Oh ! it will be so wonderful . Are n't you glad we 'll all go together ? KATRINE ( Drawing her close with suppressed excitement ) Polly , you do love me , do n't you ? POLLY Heaps and heaps . KATRINE But you love me more than any one else ? POLLY More than any one  --  except papa and Anne . p. 13 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Glancing quickly at the clock , which has moved on . ) Polly ! Would you like to take a ride in a taxi with me ? Just you and me ? So we may talk ? POLLY Wo n't you wait for papa ? Then we can go in his car . He 'll be so glad to see you . KATRINE But I want a long talk with you first . Wo n't you come ? POLLY ( Eagerly ) I 'll ask Anne if I can go . KATRINE ( Hurt ) There 's no need of asking Anne , if your mother wants you . POLLY ( Hesitating ) But papa said I must always ask her . He says there are bad people about who want to steal pretty little girls like me . KATRINE ( Coaxing her ) I know . But this will be a secret , a secret between you and me . POLLY ( Entering into the spirit of it ) A real secret for nobody but us ? KATRINE Yes . POLLY Goodie . KATRINE Get your coat  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you or she 'll guess our secret . p. 14 POLLY My coat is in the play-room , ' way upstairs . KATRINE Go the back stairs . Hurry . It 's getting late . POLLY It 's so exciting . KATRINE ( As POLLY comically tiptoes off in back through the dining-room KATRINE holds her arms out after her ) Dare I ? You 're my child , too ; and he 's taking you  --   --  ( As BANNING opens the door and enters KATRINE turns . He throws his coat and hat down on the chair . They eye each other : he in quiet resentment and astonishment at her presence ; she with a certain subdued nervousness and fear , lest POLLY should immediately return . HOWARD BANNING has already passed forty , though the slight tinge of gray about the temples and the lines of his face , deepened as they have been by great responsibilities , suggest he is older . His physique , however , reveals power controlled by a will which is indicated in his firmly set features . His manner toward KATRINE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempted consideration be-tray deeply stirred feelings underneath  --  feelings which always sway him in spite of his severe schooling in life . ) HOWARD BANNING ( Coldly ) What are you doing here ? p. 15 KATRINE ( Controlling herself ) I came to see Polly . HOWARD BANNING The courts have decided that question . KATRINE I ask five minutes alone with her . HOWARD BANNING ( Refusing it ) I am sorry . KATRINE Just five minutes . ( He is silent . ) She was born upstairs . Does n't all the pain I went through entitle me to five minutes  --  five minutes that you 'd give a stranger who wished to speak to her on the streets ? HOWARD BANNING You could have remained something else . KATRINE I 'm still her mother . HOWARD BANNING You have forfeited any rights here . KATRINE But not the right to feel . HOWARD BANNING That is your punishment . KATRINE Oh , yes : you still believe in punishment . HOWARD BANNING When one deserves it . KATRINE ( As she gazes at him sadly ) And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You offered no defense in court . KATRINE Before the law ? No . I had none to give  --  there . HOWARD BANNING ( Bitterly ) You were her mother . You should have thought of the consequences before you and Mace  --   --  KATRINE ( Quickly ) But it was not the mother in me that he caught . HOWARD BANNING ( Sarcastically ) No : it was my wife . KATRINE ( Simply ) In her loose moments ; yes . HOWARD BANNING Can you say it without shame ? KATRINE Yes : I have understanding of myself now . HOWARD BANNING And that means justification , I suppose ? KATRINE I said understanding . Ca n't you understand my suffering and give me just five minutes with Polly ? HOWARD BANNING ( Violently clutching her arms ) Katrine , why did you do this to me ? ( As he loses control of himself . ) Why did you make a fool of me ? Why did you deceive me ? Answer ! Katrine ! p. 17 KATRINE ( Coldly ) Please take your hands from me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( They stare at each other a moment : then his hands slip down her arms and he turns away . She looks at him and then nervously toward the dining-room door where she expects POLLY . JOHN enters from there as KATRINE eyes him with quick apprehension . ) JOHN I beg pardon , Mr. Banning : your taxi is here . KATRINE ( Involuntarily ) Ah ! HOWARD BANNING A taxi ? What would I want with a taxi ? JOHN ( Surprised ) He said you ' phoned you were in a hurry . HOWARD BANNING I did n't order any  --   --  KATRINE I ordered it . HOWARD BANNING ( Without suspicion ) Then say Mrs. Banning will be there in a moment . ( They wait till JOHN goes out through the dining-room . BANNING steps quietly before KATRINE as she now makes a move toward the stairs . ) Do you completely forget what has happened ? p. 18 KATRINE Could I ? HOWARD BANNING Then does your " understanding " include me ? Do you understand what you did to me ? KATRINE Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deceived me , Katrine . KATRINE Let me go . It is only Polly 's mother who is standing here . HOWARD BANNING ( Stopping her ) You should not have forgotten you were a mother . ( Firmly ) Now , please go . I do n't want you to see her . It 's not easy , I know . I 'm sorry . But you need have no fear for Polly . Since she ca n't have a mother , she will have everything  --   --  KATRINE  --  everything a father can give . I had all a husband could give  --  at least , everything he thought I should have . But one thing was wrong from the start between us : it 's why I am afraid to have her grow up here alone with you and away from me . HOWARD BANNING ( Icily ) And what , pray , is that ? KATRINE It 's your attitude toward women , Howard . You must change that before you hurt her , as you did me . ( POLLY , with her hat and coat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 19 POLLY I 'm ready , mother . Anne did n't hear me . ( She sees BANNING . ) Oh , papa , you 've come home , too . HOWARD BANNING ( Stunned ) Then you have seen Polly ? KATRINE ( Hugging POLLY ) Yes . HOWARD BANNING So ! POLLY ( Happily ) Is n't it just lovely , papa , to have mama back again to stay ? I told him that you 'd come back , mama . Oh , we both missed her so ; did n't we , papa ? KATRINE Polly ! POLLY It 's been so lonely here except when papa plays with me . Oh , I 'm so happy now . ( Kisses her . ) Are n't you happy , papa , that mama 's come home ? HOWARD BANNING Home ! You see , Katrine , what it is ? KATRINE But you at least have had her all this time . POLLY ( Whispering to her ) Shall we tell papa our secret and only keep it from Anne ? KATRINE ( Silencing her ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them ) Just five minutes alone with her , Howard . ( There is a tense pause . POLLY looks from one to the other , not understanding . Finally BANNING seems to give a silent consent . He turns to go up the stairs ) p. 20 POLLY ( Pouting ) Ca n't we take papa along in the taxi with us ? HOWARD BANNING ( Turning sharply ) Katrine ! KATRINE ( Defensively ) The child meant  --   --  HOWARD BANNING ( Taking POLLY quickly from her mother ) The taxi . I see . KATRINE No ! HOWARD BANNING I might have known ! KATRINE ( Defiantly ) Well , why not ? HOWARD BANNING Why not ? Going to steal her away from me , eh ? KATRINE She 's my child , too . ( BANNING laughs harshly . ) POLLY ( As she looks from one to the other without understanding ) Why , nobody 's going to steal me , papa . I 'm only going with mama for a ride . HOWARD BANNING ( Calling up the stairs ) Anne ! Anne ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 21 POLLY What 's the matter ? HOWARD BANNING ( Brutally ) Your mother has no right to be here . KATRINE Let me tell her ! HOWARD BANNING Not now . KATRINE ( Distracted ) Polly , come to me , dear . HOWARD BANNING You stay here . ( ANNE enters quickly down the stairs , and realizes the situation . BANNING immediately controls himself before her . ) HOWARD BANNING Anne ; take Polly to her room . ANNE Yes , sir . KATRINE ( Poignantly ) No , no . Anne , Anne ! POLLY I do n't understand . You both want me and  --   --  HOWARD BANNING Go with Anne , Polly . I want to talk with your mother  --  alone . POLLY ( Protesting ) But , papa  --   --  HOWARD BANNING That 's a good girl . Now , do as I say . KATRINE ( Desperately throughout ) Have you no pity , Howard ? p. 22 ANNE ( Taking POLLY 'S hand ) Come , dear . KATRINE My arms are empty , Howard  --  empty . POLLY Mama ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out her arms ) Polly ! Polly ! Polly ! POLLY But , Anne , why wo n't papa let me  --   --  ? ( ANNE gently leads the bewildered child off . KATRINE and BANNING both look after POLLY . Then KATRINE sinks on one of the chests , overcome . He turns to her , bitterly . ) HOWARD BANNING You tried to trick me . ( She does not answer except with a sob . ) Katrine ! You tried to trick me ! KATRINE Yes . HOWARD BANNING To steal her away . KATRINE ( Pleading ) Only for a ride with me , at first . But when she said you were going abroad for a long while  --   --  HOWARD BANNING Where were you going to take her ? KATRINE Anywhere . I did n't know . p. 23 HOWARD BANNING To give her what ? KATRINE A mother 's love . HOWARD BANNING Who robbed her of it ? KATRINE I 'm here to give it . HOWARD BANNING And what else ? KATRINE Protection , support , all . HOWARD BANNING ( With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll let me . HOWARD BANNING Let you ? And how are you going to do it ? With Mace 's money ? KATRINE ( Her whole defensive manner changing to one of assertion ) With my own money ! I 'm earning it now  --  working . HOWARD BANNING Working ? KATRINE Women do , you know . HOWARD BANNING ( With incredulous sarcasm throughout ) You earning money ? KATRINE ( Abruptly facing him ) How did you think I would live ? HOWARD BANNING I offered you money . p. 24 KATRINE Yes : that was your one human act in all this ! But I could no longer give you anything in return . Mace offered me money , too . I had nothing further to give him . There seems to be only one reason women think they can take money from men . HOWARD BANNING So Mace lets you work ? KATRINE ( Emphatically ) He has nothing to do with my actions . HOWARD BANNING ( Astonished ) Then you 're not going to marry him ? KATRINE Why should I ? HOWARD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else . KATRINE Who disgraced my name ? HOWARD BANNING Your own act . KATRINE Which you and the courts spread abroad . But does that give you both the further right to keep my child from me ? HOWARD BANNING Since you forgot what you owed your husband , every right . KATRINE What has her future to do with what I owed you ? You divorced me , did n't you ? The law no longer compels you to support me , does it ? I have paid the social penalty , have n't I ? What further do I owe you ? p. 25 HOWARD BANNING You owe it to me to leave my daughter alone , so that she will forget you as I want to . KATRINE But my child loves me . HOWARD BANNING Children forget  --  like some women . KATRINE ( Quickly ) And I should want her to forget me if I were still what I was when I lived here with you . But I 'll never let her forget me now  --  for now I can be a good mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! As if a woman like you could be a good mother after what has happened . KATRINE I can because of what has happened . HOWARD BANNING It was all of your own making . KATRINE ( With directness ) Are you so sure ? Have you ever asked yourself inside whether it was all my fault ? Have you , Howard ? HOWARD BANNING There 's nothing to argue . I only know one miserable , rotten fact : the one fact a man never forgets . KATRINE Which thousands of women accept and forget in men ! ( He dismisses it . ) A mother has her great fact , too : that she bore her child ! Has any man ever the right to forget that ? p. 26 HOWARD BANNING That does n't excuse what you did to me . KATRINE No . If my fidelity was all you prized me for . HOWARD BANNING ( With feeling ) You think that was all I  --   --  ? KATRINE It was all you considered when the test came . You thought of nothing else . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even ask for an explanation . HOWARD BANNING ( Bitterly ) What could you have explained ? KATRINE Nothing then , perhaps  --  that 's why I did n't try . For then I did n't know myself . HOWARD BANNING But you did know I had given you everything . KATRINE For teas and Tangoes and Bridge and pretty gowns and jewels , yes . But what did you give me for myself ? HOWARD BANNING ( Not understanding ) Yourself ? KATRINE Yes , for me  --  me ! To do with as I saw fit . HOWARD BANNING I gave you what every man in my position wants to give his wife : leisure ; comfort and leisure . p. 27 KATRINE Yes . And it was leisure which ruined our life together . HOWARD BANNING ( Laughing cynically ) A woman ruined by leisure ! KATRINE Leisure ! Leisure ! Not leisure to use as I wished , to use in something I thought worth while , in something which differed from your way of looking at life . But leisure with you always watching it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to bother about how you spent your days ? KATRINE ( As he walks up and down impatiently ) You always questioned me . You always disapproved of my actions if they differed from those of our idle women friends . You knew exactly what I should and should not do . I must n't do this or that , for fear people would talk . Why , do you remember how you stormed because I happened to contribute to those poor garment strikers the money you had given me to waste on Bridge ? HOWARD BANNING ( Denying her words throughout ) I told you then I could n't have my name in the newspapers mixed up with that damn radical stuff . KATRINE That 's it . Your name ! Now we have it . ( He faces her . ) That 's always what I had to consider . p. 28 HOWARD BANNING You were my wife . It was your business to consider me . KATRINE But did I have to make everybody think I believed the same as you ? Did I have to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't I be myself in what I was trying to do to escape my boredom here , without fearing everybody would criticise you ? Could n't I do or say anything for myself because I bore your name ? HOWARD BANNING ( Sarcastically ) And I suppose that was the reason you forgot your home ? KATRINE With servants to run it . HOWARD BANNING You had your child . KATRINE Which you insisted our nurses should bring up . You did n't even want me to nurse my own child because it interfered with  --  ( suddenly ) Why , Howard , now that I think of it , you did n't even ask me if I wanted to have a child . HOWARD BANNING ( Recoiling and staring at her as though he could not grasp how much she has changed ) Katrine ! KATRINE And what did I know of these matters when you brought me here ? I did n't know anything of children . I did n't know anything of their health or care or education . Nothing . Yet I found myself a mother . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ignorant . And when I tried to reach out and learn , when I wanted instruction and help , when I felt I simply had to be something myself before I could be anything to her  --  you laughed at me . ( He protests ) Oh , you meant it in kindness : you meant it all in kindness : that 's what is so tragic ! p. 29 HOWARD BANNING ( With icy incredulity ) And you think now I should let you have Polly ? KATRINE Yes ; because I love her more than ever now , and because now I am free to learn . ( Pleading suddenly again ) Polly is only a girl , Howard ; she 'll be a woman soon . My heart 's longing for her as she grows up , so she wo n't make my mistakes , be ignorant as I was when I married . For there are facts about men and women you never could tell her with your way of thinking about women . Howard , let me be part of her life every day as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her incredulously ) But you do n't seem to realize what you are ! KATRINE Yes , I do . But what was I ? Do you realize that ? ( He is silent . ) What was there for me , here ? A few hours with you . What for ? Theaters , opera  --  ( With sincerity ) Howard , what was my life here ? HOWARD BANNING Just what you made it . KATRINE What you made me make it : an empty shell of a life on silk cushions , bored  --  bored , depressed , careless , and useless . You gave me leisure and I made the most of it . p. 30 HOWARD BANNING With Mace ! KATRINE ( Wearily ) Oh ; it might have been anybody . HOWARD BANNING ( With bitterness ) And you think a woman who can say that is fit to bring up a young girl ? KATRINE ( Persuasively , with deep feeling ) Why not ? Because I 'm not full of remorse , weeping away what little strength I have in regrets ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm using what happened in the past to lead my future into something better ? Has my one fault  --  miserable , despicable , anything the world may call it  --  has it torn out my mother 's heart ? Have n't you seen it breaking here ? Do you think I 'd have come back here after all you put me through , if my motherhood were n't still alive ? Can your courts and your laws and all the sins of the world stamp out that feeling ? Can you crush out all the good in me , because I 've been guilty of my one wrong to you ? Can you judge me as I stand here , with my eyes open to life for the first time , by that  --  only that  --  and nothing else ? HOWARD BANNING ( Who has been moved by her words ) God , Katrine ! Do n't I know you love our child ! KATRINE Then let me have her . p. 31 HOWARD BANNING You love her : but so do I. KATRINE I know : I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it were only to somebody else you were pleading ! But you wronged me  --  me . Your husband ! I ca n't get that out of the way . I ca n't forget it .  --  You 're pleading for yourself . But what about me ? Because you want her , does that bring back the home that is broken up ? KATRINE Was it a home ? HOWARD BANNING Must I lose her , too , because you 're a woman ? Are you going to play on that weakness to gain your end ? KATRINE We fight with what weapons you men leave us . HOWARD BANNING You deceived me . You steal into the house now like a thief . You try to trick me : yet you stand there justifying yourself and your rotten wrong to me , because you bore her . Ca n't a man love his child , too ? KATRINE Does n't that make you understand my love ? HOWARD BANNING ( Bitterly throughout ) But why should I give her up ? Why should I let her go with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ? She 's all there is now . Am I going to let you push me aside because you 're a mother ? Any woman can be a mother ! You talk as though it was something unusual . You think you bear the whole responsibilities of a child . You think the father 's just a  --   --  . Why should I pay for all the wreckage that you brought about just because Nature happened to make you as it did ? p. 32 KATRINE Am I not paying it , too ? HOWARD BANNING ( Persistently ) But how are you going to square the account with me ? KATRINE Was I alone to blame for our failure ? HOWARD BANNING Answer me . KATRINE ( Insistingly ) Was all the fault mine ? HOWARD BANNING You 're evading my question . KATRINE I want your answer . HOWARD BANNING ( Trying to put conviction in his words ) Yes ; the fault was all yours . KATRINE Howard ! If I 'd been happy here , would we have gone on the rocks ? Could any woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd been a stronger woman  --   --  KATRINE ( Quickly ) Grant my weakness , then ; grant everything I was . Should n't you have helped me and strengthened me ? HOWARD BANNING ( Confused ) But  --   --  KATRINE ( Searchingly ) Howard ! Howard ! Was all the fault mine ? p. 33 HOWARD BANNING ( He is halted by her tone : he seems to question himself for a moment , then he waves it aside ) What difference does it make who 's to blame when a thing 's done ? Why talk of blame at this late day , in the face of all this wreckage and waste ? KATRINE ( Quickly ) Wreckage  --  yes ; but whether it is to be waste or not rests with us . ( He looks at her . ) Howard , there is good in this  --  if only you will see it . HOWARD BANNING Good ? Here in this empty house ? KATRINE Yes ; for you and me . HOWARD BANNING There can be nothing between you and me . KATRINE There is always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more we both have to give her now ? HOWARD BANNING Living apart ? KATRINE ( With vision ) Yes : even that way . It 's not as it should be , of course : but we must build out of the wreckage as best we may ; and you and I have built better apart than we did together . Do n't you see how we can go on building for Polly ? That 's where she , too , will gain by all this  --  if we wish it . p. 34 HOWARD BANNING ( Wearily ) I can see no gain . KATRINE But you can see what you call my sin has not broken me : you can see I 've grown really to love her through my need , through my anxiety for her future , through everything . Is n't Anne right ? Have n't we both grown to love Polly more since this happened ? HOWARD BANNING Anne dared ? KATRINE But is n't she right ? Was either of us a good parent before ? What was there in our lives worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) What ? Here we were : two people : you with your money-making and me with my leisure . Did either of us give her love ? HOWARD BANNING What I gave was love . KATRINE Like it is now ? ( Smiling . ) Now you play at sailing boats in the bath-tub  --  and you got your coat wet ! HOWARD BANNING ( Moved ) She told you that ? KATRINE Yes . You never played with her before . Polly noticed it . HOWARD BANNING ( Almost inaudibly ) Poor little kid . p. 35 KATRINE Howard , that is the good in all this , if we will admit it . Her love did n't hold either of us to very much before  --  did it ? And now we are both stronger through our suffering . Yes ; better for ourselves  --  and Polly . ( She comes close to him . ) Our marriage is over . It was a failure . But we 're still her father and mother . Must we be enemies fighting over the possession of our child ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BANNING Friends ? You and me ? With this wrong between us ? KATRINE The wrong was between husband and wife . Polly stands between father and mother . That 's all we are now , Howard . Father and mother ! She 's our child : born of you and me . She loves us both . Ca n't we both have her till she grows up and leaves us  --  as children do ? HOWARD BANNING Father and mother ! ( BANNING rises after a long pause . He has been deeply moved , yet he hesitates . Then he looks at her as she stands there watching him with a calm serenity . He moves slowly to the foot of the stairs . There is a silence . ) HOWARD BANNING ( Calling ) Polly ! Polly ! POLLY ( Upstairs ) Yes , papa . p. 36 HOWARD BANNING Come here . POLLY In a minute . KATRINE Howard ? HOWARD BANNING ( Turning to her quietly ) Was I nothing in your life ? KATRINE Oh , yes : Howard . HOWARD BANNING Then why did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life too early to stay all through . I was a girl . How could I know ? HOWARD BANNING ( Lowering his head ) I thought I was a good husband , as men go . KATRINE You would have made some woman very happy . I suppose down deep , Howard , I did n't only want to be taken care of like lots of women we know . HOWARD BANNING Maybe it 's an old , old story , after all . KATRINE Yes : the world is full of old stories . HOWARD BANNING ( With difficulty ) I love Polly , Katrine ; but  --   --  KATRINE You think I have some claim ? HOWARD BANNING We will let Polly decide which one she will go with . p. 37 KATRINE ( Quickly ) No ! HOWARD BANNING Are you afraid ? KATRINE It would be cruel of us to shift the decision on her . HOWARD BANNING But it 's her life . KATRINE Suppose she chooses me ? HOWARD BANNING I 'm willing to take that risk . KATRINE ( Startled ) You think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's what we must find out . ( Calling . ) Polly ! KATRINE Oh , you 'd let me see her , would n't you ? You 'd let me hold her in my arms ? HOWARD BANNING And if she went with you ? KATRINE I should always want her to hold her father 's hand . I do n't want her to lose either of us . All I ask is to let me see her now and then ; let me have her part of the time . HOWARD BANNING It ca n't be that way . She  --  she must decide ! KATRINE No , no ! My love is greater than that . You 've broken me , Howard . Rather than submit her to that , I give in . You have the power here . The courts have given her to you . And we 've got to submit , as Anne says , if the stronger ca n't understand us . Do what your heart says , Howard . I only ask you to be bigger than the law . ( POLLY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment , between the two , who gaze at her . Then she goes quietly to BANNING. ) p. 38 POLLY You called me , papa ? HOWARD BANNING ( With an effort throughout as he strokes her hair and holds her hand ) Your mother has come back from a long journey and  --  she wants you to go with her . POLLY Has n't mama come back home for good ? HOWARD BANNING Polly , it 's this way ; I  --   --  KATRINE I 'll tell her , Howard . HOWARD BANNING I could n't tell her everything . KATRINE ( Calmly ) She shall know everything in time . And I shall be fair to you . POLLY ( Puzzled ) Papa , I wish you 'd tell me what it means . HOWARD BANNING ( Half breaking , as he sits with his face buried in his hands ) I do n't know what it means  --  I do n't know . POLLY Do you , mama ? KATRINE Sometimes I know . But not for very long , dear . ( KATRINE crosses to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he rises and moves away from her gently as she withdraws her hand. ) p. 39 HOWARD BANNING ( Recovering his self-possession ) To-morrow your mother will come to you , Polly , and you 're to go with her for a while . KATRINE ( Overwhelmed ) Howard ! POLLY Am I going to live in two places ? KATRINE ( Hugging her ) Yes ; in both our hearts . ( BANNING has pressed the push-button . JOHN enters from back . ) HOWARD BANNING Is the taxi there ? JOHN Yes , sir . HOWARD BANNING Mrs. Banning is ready now . ( JOHN crosses to door which he opens , and stands there waiting . KATRINE looks at BANNING as his back is turned . Then she kisses POLLY . ) KATRINE To-morrow , Polly . ( KATRINE goes to the chest on which she has left her bag , containing the door-key . She takes this , decides to keep the key , turns and looks back at BANNING , who is now facing her . ) Thank you , Howard . ( She hesitates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good-by . We may need to talk to each other again . p. 40 HOWARD BANNING About what ? KATRINE About Polly . ( KATRINE goes out . JOHN closes the door and goes off in back . BANNING sinks into the chair again , staring before him . ) POLLY Papa ; why must I live in two places ? ( She goes to him but he does not answer. )
