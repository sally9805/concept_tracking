SCENE : Library in the old Fifth Avenue mansion of Mrs. Simms-Vane . It is an old-fashioned , thoroughly substantial room and an ideal setting for its owner . French windows , overlooking Fifth Avenue and extending to the floor , are in the middle of the rear wall . Bookcases on each side of them extend to a door at rear right and to a writing desk at left front . There is a chair near the window , one by the table , and one by the desk . Prominent among the usual desk fittings must be a small gold stamp box . A waste-paper basket stands beside the desk , in full view of the audience . Several porcelain vases are placed about the room . A long library table , holding two brass candlesticks , is at right front . Just above it , on the right wall , a large , long mirror hangs so that it reflects the opposite side of the room . PLACE : New York City . TIME : The present . About three o'clock on a raing afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark because of the rainy day and the drawn curtains . The French window in the rear opens cautiously and Miller stealthily slips into the room . He is a tall , handsome man  --  the usual type of gentleman crook who has emerged from the bottom of his nefarious profession . He wears a dark raincoat and a soft black hat , pulled down a little over his eyes . As he starts to advance into the room , approaching footsteps are heard off right . Frightened , he slips behind the heavy curtains at the window . Lucille enters from the door at right . She is in the conventional white apron and cap of a well groomed parlor maid . She stops for a moment to tidy the table , glances up at the mirror , and starts to make a slight readjustment of her cap . Suddenly she realizes that it is too dark for her to see , goes to the window , and quickly pulls back the curtains , flooding the room with light and revealing Miller . The moment she sees Miller , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 3 MILLER frightened , he comes forward cautiouslyDo n't shout ! LUCILLE You nearly scared the life out of me ! MILLER Do n't tell it to the whole house . Glances toward door . Lucille , anybody about ? Throughout the following scene , Lucille and Miller give their lines quickly , feverishly , for they fear that they may be interrupted at any moment . LUCILLE Not yet ; but they wheel Mrs. Simms-Vane in here every afternoon . You 're not safe here ! Tries to hurry him to the window . MILLER catching her by the armQuick ! Where does she keep the Thirty-three ? LUCILLE carelessly , as she jerks her arm awayWhy should I tell you ? MILLER Going to hog the necklace yourself ' stead of divvying up with me , huh ? LUCILLE No . MILLER Then what the hell 's the matter with you ? LUCILLE You 've been taking that Minnie out again ! MILLER Naw , I 'm on the level with you . p. 4 LUCILLE scornfullyHuh ! MILLER Did n't I say we 'd get married soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that . MILLER Then , what 's in your craw ? Jealous again ? LUCILLE Why not ? I 've got everything staked on you ! MILLER And you can play it for all it 's worth . It 'll take both of us to steal the Thirty three . LUCILLE Miller , it 's a wonderful necklace . MILLER Worth forty thousand dollars . LUCILLE Thirty-three blue-white diamonds . Would n't think an old dame would be so stuck on it ! MILLER No more than we are . Nudges her affectionately . Now , where does she keep it ? LUCILLE In this room ! MILLER This room ? LUCILLE Yes , they say she comes in here to look at it ; but no one 's ever seen her do it ! MILLER Good enough ; we 'll cop it this very afternoon ! LUCILLE How ? p. 5 MILLER Listen , this is the dope . LUCILLE eagerlyUh-huh . MILLER Servants are off to-day , ' cept you , the cook , and the old dame 's companion . Cook 's way down in the kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . LUCILLE How ? MILLER Dennis is across the street  --  watching this window . LUCILLE Why ? MILLER When the time 's ready , I 'll signal him with this handkerchief and right off the phone here will ring . You answer it . LUCILLE puzzledWhat 's the game ? MILLER Dennis is going to send a fake message  --  something about a phony check  --  that 'll get Miss Jones out of the house . Want you to answer the phone so 's to be sure it 's Dennis . Then call her , understand ? LUCILLE Yes ! MILLER After that it 'll be plain sailing . LUCILLE But Dennis 'll want some of the boot for doing that ? MILLER Naw , I promised him a tenner if he 'd send the phone message and then beat it to the station and get a couple of tickets for us . Murmur of voices from off right. p. 6 LUCILLE Oh , they 're coming now . Better get away in a hurry ! Miller runs to the window . MILLER Do n't forget to answer that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here ! Hurry up and get out ! MILLER No , I 'm going to stay right here . LUCILLE But they 'll see you ! MILLER No , they wo n't . I 'll slide behind this curtain . He slips behind one of the window curtains , which remain partly open . He is completely concealed . Lucille pretends to arrange articles on the desk , furtively glancing at right door . From right enter Miss Jones , pushing an invalid 's chair in which is seated Mrs. Simms-Vane . Miss Jones , the paid companion of Mrs. Simms-Vane , is a rather dull , systematic English woman , not in the least understanding her mistress , but as a result of long service , obeying her to the letter . Mrs. Simms-Vane , a hopeless paralytic for twenty years , can not move her chin a quarter of an inch to left or right . Her body is rigid ; her cheeks are webbed with the fine wrinkles of the years ; her eyes are beautiful with patience ; and her mouth is lovely with the firmness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the age of sixty , as inert as a faded flower . She wears a rich but simple dress of black silk with white lace at the throat . Miss Jones wheels the chair to left center , somewhat to rear , and facing the table and the mirror on the right wall . She lifts one of the invalid 's hands and places it so that it rests easily on the arm of her chair . As she goes to the other side of the chair and arranges the other hand in a similar manner , Miller , with his eye on Miss Jones and watched by Lucille , silently steps from behind the curtain , glances out the window , gives a quick wave of his handkerchief  --  the signal to the unseen Dennis  --  and slips behind the curtain again without being seen by either Miss Jones or Mrs. Simms-Vane . Mrs. SIMMS-VANE as Miss Jones starts to make a slight adjustment of the old lady 's head against the back of her chairNo , to the right . Miss Jones moves the head slightly . Too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the head again. p. 7 MISS JONES May I ask why you always want your head faced that way ? MRS . SIMMS-VANE coolly amusedYou may ask . Mrs. Simms-Vane 's tone causes Miss Jones to step back abashed , and she does not venture the question . The telephone on the desk rings . Miss Jones starts toward it ; but Lucille has already picked it up . LUCILLE I ' ll answer it , Miss Jones . Speaks into the telephone . Hello  --  Yes  --  Yes ! Glances in direction of Miller.  --  All right . I 'll call her . Turns to Miss JonesIt 's for you , Miss Jones . MISS JONES Thank you . Goes to telephoneHello  --  Yes  --  Oh , is that so ?  --  Very well . I 'll be right down to see about it .  --  Thank you . Good-bye . Hangs up the receiver and goes to Mrs. Simms-Vane . Mrs. Simms-Vane , that was the Empire National Bank on the phone . MRS . SIMMS-VANE Yes ? MISS JONES The cashier has discovered what appears to be an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They asked me to go immediately to their down-town offices ; and I told them I would . p. 8 MRS . SIMMS-VANE Very well . MISS JONES to LucilleYou will remain here with Mrs. Simms-Vane . There will be nothing to do for her . Goes to the door at right where she turns and says to LucilleEven though it is raining , she will take her daily ride at four as usual . By that time , probably , I shall return . LUCILLE with a superior airVery good , Miss Jones . Exit Miss Jones . A moment 's silence , then an outside door closes . Miller steps out from behind the curtain and beckons for Lucille to come to him . She does so and together they step out into the room and look threateningly at Mrs. Simms-Vane for a moment . They are now in her range of vision and she stares at them without the flicker of an eyelash . MRS . SIMMS-VANE calmlyLucille , who is this gentleman ? Lucille fidgets . Why is he here ? Lucille becomes more nervous . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . SIMMS-VANE I fear , Lucille , that I have been mistaken in you . MILLER to Mrs. Simms-VaneNow , there ' ll be no nonsense ! p. 9 MRS . SIMMS-VANE I think I understand . MILLER Better for you , if you do ! MRS . SIMMS-VANE Sir , will you kindly step forward three or four steps ? MILLER What for ? MRS . SIMMS-VANE I am unable , because of my infirmity , to turn my head ; and I prefer to talk looking into the eyes . MILLER stepping in front of Mrs. Simms-VaneWe 'll not have much talk . Quickly , to LucilleYou mind that door . Points to door , which Lucille closes as Miller goes to the telephone and cuts its green cord . Resuming his position in front of Mrs. Simms-VaneNow , Mrs. Simms-Vane , I 'll tell you why I 'm here . MRS . SIMMS-VANE Yes ? MILLER I come for the Thirty-three , and you 're going to tell me where it is . MRS . SIMMS-VANE slight surpriseSo you call it the Thirty-three ? MILLER Need n't pretend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ai n't got much time . Now , where is it ? Points a menacing finger at Mrs. Simms-Vane 's face . She merely smiles and looks at him without making the slightest movement. p. 10 MRS . SIMMS-VANE firmly , but softlySir , you have made a mistake to come here . MILLER Mistake ? Ha ! Halfway laughs . MRS . SIMMS-VANE It is true that I am a helpless invalid and can not call for assistance ; but there is that which will cause you to fail . You shall have a disaster . LUCILLE as she comes to Miller , frightenedOh , Miller , what does she mean ? MILLER ignores Lucille . Speaks sneeringly to Mrs. Simms-VaneYou mean you 'll call on God ? Well , my nerve 's good for that stuff . MRS . SIMMS-VANE referring to LucilleHers is not . Miller turns and looks at Lucille , who has become very nervous . LUCILLE It 's a lie ! The old fossil ! MRS . SIMMS-VANE a little , slow smile passes over her face as she continues in her calm voiceNevertheless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then , what do you mean ? MRS . SIMMS-VANE I think you will fail , because you are not made of the material that succeeds . You are both of the base metals  --  unrestrained , passionate , and vulgar . p. 11 LUCILLE her vanity is hurtThe idea ! MRS . SIMMS-VANE Yes , and that is why you made a mistake to come into conflict with me . MILLER Bah ! MRS . SIMMS-VANE At the very outset , sir , you made a mistake . MILLER Mistake  --  what mistake ? MRS . SIMMS-VANE Almost your first words disclosed the fact that you did not know where the necklace is laid away . MILLER You 're not very clever yourself . You 've just as well as well as admitted the Thirty three 's in this room . Jerks off his raincoat , throws it on the floor , and starts to search for the Thirty-three among the papers in the writing-desk drawers . Lucille still keeps guard at the door . Mrs. Simms-Vane , unable to turn her head , stares ahead at nothing . MRS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voiceWill you trust in one who has never broken her word to anyone ? MILLER stops suddenly and looks at Mrs. Simms-VaneWhat are you trying to get at ? MRS . SIMMS-VANE Suppose I promise to reward you Lucille starts forward jealouslyboth to the full ? Lucille sinks back relieved. p. 12 MILLER What are you giving us ? MRS . SIMMS-VANE The necklace is my most treasured possession , not because of its money value , but because my dear , dead husband gave it to me when we were young and very happy . Lucille turns away , sickened by this expression of sentiment . MILLER What 's that got to do with us ? MRS . SIMMS-VANE That is why I will not have it taken from me . LUCILLE Listen to her ! MILLER coarse laughHa ! MRS . SIMMS-VANE Then look out for yourselves . I warn you . Miller walks back until he stands in front of Mrs. Simms-Vane . Suddenly he takes a pistol from his pocket and thrusts the muzzle of it into her face . MILLER growlingWhere 's the thing hid ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . He pushes the revolver nearer her . Where 's it hid ? MRS . SIMMS-VANE Do you think I fear that you will pull that trigger ? MILLER Why would n't I ? p. 13 MRS . SIMMS-VANE Can you not see how beautiful that would be for me  --  a hopeless invalid ? MILLER not understandingHuh ? MRS . SIMMS-VANE But it is too much to hope . You would not shoot me . MILLER I ' ll soon show you ! MRS . SIMMS-VANE Ah , no , that would make a noise . MILLER impatientlyWhat if it did ? MRS . SIMMS-VANE Then you could not continue your search . No , I can not hope that you will pull that trigger . MILLER realizing the truth of her words , drops the pistol to his side . You 're a tough old nut . MRS . SIMMS-VANE Thank you , sir . That is very kind . MILLER Bah ! Then to LucillePull out the books , girlie . We 've got to frisk the whole room . LUCILLE coming forwardAll right ! MILLER Go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vases ! LUCILLE Yes , yes ! Begins to execute his commands. p. 14 MILLER Remember , she said it was " laid away "  --  that 's the cue . LUCILLE Uh-huh . Miller returns to the desk , tosses papers and boxes to the floor , opens the stamp box on the desk , finds a locked drawer , and feverishly splinters it open . Lucille is hastily pulling out the books from the shelves and searching the wall behind them for any secret hiding place of the necklace . The room is in welter of discorder . Finally , Miller returns to his revolver which he left on the table as he made his rounds of the room , stares down at it , and bites his lip . MILLER growlingDamn ! Time wasted ! Looks at Mrs. Simms-Vane and takes a pair of steel pliers from his side pocket , opens them , and looks down at them . It 's rough work ; but it ' s got to be done . Goes to Mrs. Simms-Vane and closes his hand over one of her white wrists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's some feeling in this hand . I thought so . He slips the toothed jaws of the pliers between the thumb and forefinger down upon the soft flesh in the crotch of her thumb and closes the pliers upon it . Now , where 's the necklace ? Mrs. Simms-Vane silently stares at him . Better tell . She merely closes her eyes . You better tell ! Lucille shudders as she sees that he is squeezing the pliers in his tightening grip . Curse you ! Out with it ! Where 's the necklace ? p. 15 MRS . SIMMS-VANE That is painful ; but I do not think pain will ever be my master . I shall not tell you . LUCILLE Stop ! Stop , Miller ! The blood 's coming ! MILLER Let it come . LUCILLE But she wo n't tell ! Oh , you 're crushing the flesh ! Stop ! Starts to pull him away . MRS . SIMMS-VANE opening her eyesAh , she 's weakened ! I said you were both made of inferior stuff . This French doll of yours , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady who can not move and yet a few drops of red blood make her cry out . What a pair you are  --  all boastfulness ; but your nerves are made of shoddy . Miller drops the pliers in his pocket , looks at Lucille , and sneers . LUCILLE to MillerDo n't ! Do n't look at me like that ! MILLER Why not ? The old dame 's right about us . Outside , a clock strikes three o'clock . MRS . SIMMS-VANE fretfullyIt 's three . I ordered my hot milk for three . MILLER wheeling toward LucilleThe cook ' ll bring it in ? p. 16 LUCILLE sullenlyPerhaps . MILLER Quick , then ! Go to the kitchen . Say she sent you for it . I ' ll take another look round the room . Lucille shrugs her shoulders and exits . Miller starts to search in the desk drawers again . MRS . SIMMS-VANE sees him in the mirrorYoung man , I see you 're searching in those drawers again . I would not waste my time doing that . MILLER startledWhy not ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish to know . MILLER What ? MRS . SIMMS-VANE Come and stand in front of me . MILLER he does so , staring at her . Well ? MRS . SIMMS-VANE You may be surprised , sir , to hear that I can not help admiring the boldness you have shown in coming here . MILLER Aw , what are you giving me now ? MRS . SIMMS-VANE I have always been attracted by ability , wherever it showed itself and  --  MILLER with contemptWords , words . p. 17 MRS . SIMMS-VANE No-o , but you are a hand-some young man , and it is a pity that your magnetism and power should be thrown away on such a worthless young woman as Lucille . MILLER Aw , Lucille 's all right . MRS . SIMMS-VANE Pah ! You saw her cringe ! MILLER Well ? MRS . SIMMS-VANE A pretty face  --  that 's all she is . And you are infatuated with her  --  you who could win women far above her class . She stands in your way . This very occasion is an example of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . SIMMS-VANE In the next fifteen minutes she may cost you forty thousand dollars . MILLER leaning nearerHow ' s it figured ? MRS . SIMMS-VANE I do n't trust her ; but I could  --  trade with you . MILLER Trade ? MRS . SIMMS-VANE Did it not occur to you , sir , that forty thousand dollars is very little to me ? If I spent it , it would be charged to my heirs . MILLER What 's that got to do with the Thirty-three ? MRS . SIMMS-VANE I would willingly send you a check for the amount , if you would go away . p. 18 MILLER scornfullyHuh ! MRS . SIMMS-VANE But it is too much to ask you to take my word for that . However , I could take yours . MILLER eagerlyYes ? MRS . SIMMS-VANE But not if Lucille were involved . MILLER Why not ? MRS . SIMMS-VANE I love those stones the most of all material things  --  and I would not trust them to her . MILLER glances toward door , then leans nearer to her , alertHow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can not . I meant that if I could trust you  --  you alone  --  with the necklace until I could arrange to buy it back from you , I would pay you more for it than its appraised value . MILLER How much more ? MRS . SIMMS-VANE Twenty-five per cent more . MILLER I 'll do it ! Where ' s the necklace ? MRS . SIMMS-VANE But I fear the girl . MILLER discounting her Oh , that girl ? p. 19 MRS . SIMMS-VANE Yes , you love her ; and a man in love is not to be trusted . MILLER Aw , she ' s not the only girl I got . MRS . SIMMS-VANE O-oh  --  and still I ' ve no doubt you have even agreed to share your gains with her . MILLER Well ? MRS . SIMMS-VANE It is that which has invited my contempt . MILLER I never promised her a split . Besides , I know you ' re right about Lucille . MRS . SIMMS-VANE Then twenty thousand dollars is a high price to pay for this cheap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay it  --  unless she knows I 've got the sparkless . MRS . SIMMS-VANE Would you then ? MILLER Yes , she 's a little wildcat , and she 'd squeal on me . MRS . SIMMS-VANE Then you mean that you would not reveal to her that you have the necklace ? MILLER Sure . MRS . SIMMS-VANE You mean that you would give me the chance to purchase back the diamonds from you ? MILLER Yes . MRS . SIMMS-VANE You mean that you would promise to take nothing else from this house ? p. 20 MILLER What else is there ? MRS . SIMMS-VANE There is a stamp box on the writing desk . You opened it . I heard its click . MILLER What of it ? MRS . SIMMS-VANE It is made of solid gold . MILLER surprised that he should have missed such a valuable article , picks it up and stares at itGold ? That made of gold ? MRS . SIMMS-VANE Yes . Thinking Mrs. Simms-Vane can not see him , he starts to pocket the stamp box . She sees his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of satisfaction . He is startled , not quite sure whether she saw his action or not . Quickly , but reluctantly , he puts the stamp box on the desk . MILLER in an over-generous toneWell , what of it ? I 'd play straight ; but how do I know that you  --  MRS . SIMMS-VANE You would have the word of Justinia Simms-Vane . Her honor has never been questioned . It would last as long as your own . MILLER stares at her a moment I 'm no fool . Lucille 's not worth the fuss . Where 's the necklace ? p. 21 MRS . SIMMS-VANE Come near me . He does so . Open the buttons of my dress . MILLER accusinglyBut you said it was " laid away . " MRS . SIMMS-VANE I chose my words carefully . Open my dress . MILLER opens her dress and sees the necklace round her throatJudas Garryowen ! She wears them ! What stones ! What stones ! MRS . SIMMS-VANE Take it quickly . He does so and at once begins to pick the stones from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  He is too busy to explain . MRS . SIMMS-VANE I say , what are you doing ? MILLER Picking the stones from their settings . MRS . SIMMS-VANE But I do n't understand  --  MILLER picks out remaining stonesJust a way we have . Drops chain into wastebasket . MRS . SIMMS-VANE What was that noise ? MILLER Chain going into the basket . I take no chances . p. 22 MRS . SIMMS-VANE But you will do me the favor to button my dress . Lucille  --  MILLER Yes , yes ; but look at them ! Gloats over diamonds . Thirty-three perfect ones ! A-ah , what a handful ! Look ! Holds them before her . MRS . SIMMS-VANE They are pretty ; but my dress  --  MILLER All right . Drops stones in his right pocket , fastens her dress , and starts to adjust her lace collar . MRS . SIMMS-VANE I hear Lucille bringing  --  MILLER How you going to put her off the scent ? MRS . SIMMS-VANE Leave that to me . If you are the gentleman I think you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MILLER Well ; but how will you fix her ? MRS . SIMMS-VANE Just continue your search . MILLER But I 've finished this room ! MRS . SIMMS-VANE Then try the next ; but leave the girl to me . MILLER takes out the diamonds , looks at them a momentAll right . Walks away . But do n't you play any tricks on me. p. 23 MRS . SIMMS-VANE Sir , that will depend upon you . He misses her inference and starts going through the drawers again . Suddenly , Mrs. Simms-Vane hears him stop . Reflected in the mirror on the wall before her she sees him reach for the gold stamp box on the desk , slowly grasp it , and put it in his pocket . She sighs and closes her eyes . Lucille appears in the doorway , carrying a tray which holds a tall glass of hot milk . MILLER seeing LucilleYou got the milk , huh ? LUCILLE Yes , but the cook wanted to bring it in herself . MILLER Well , I 've frisked the room all over again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The old lady 's done us . LUCILLE Look some more . We got lots more time . MRS . SIMMS-VANE I want my hot milk . LUCILLE Forget it ! Sets tray on the table . MILLER over-generousNo , give her the milk . LUCILLE surprisedWhat 's come over you ? p. 24 MILLER Come here . Lucille does so . Half whisperListen , give her the milk and keep her busy . Do anything . LUCILLE What for ? MILLER I want to see if there 's anything worth picking up in the other rooms . LUCILLE But  --  ? MILLER Go on ; give her the milk . Astounded , Lucille stares at him ; but she takes the milk to Mrs. Simms-Vane . Miller wanders through the door into the adjoining room . Again and again his shadow appears near the doorway , as though he were watching the women . MRS . SIMMS-VANE You forget , my dear , that I can not move . Put the glass to my lips . Lucille does so . A little nearer . Lucille puts the glass nearer Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lucille glances at her ; but moves the glass to the other side of Mrs. Simms-Vane 's mouth . What 's that ? Dirt ? Is that dirt in my milk ? Impatiently , Lucille looks at the milk . WhisperingDo not show any surprise , Lucille . Keep looking at the milk . LUCILLE whisperingYes. p. 25 MRS .

He has the diamonds ! LUCILLE whisperingOh ! MRS . SIMMS-VANE whisperingThe necklace without the stones is in the wastebasket . The revolver  --  is on the table .

She gets it . Stand back now ! MILLER But Lucille  --  LUCILLE You double-crossed me  --  after I loved you so ! MILLER Listen , girlie , the old lady 's framed us . I love you , girlie . You know me . You get your share ! This was the only way I could get the necklace ! It was all for you ! MRS . SIMMS-VANE Oh , Lucille , you little fool ! The other woman is the one !

Miller seizes a brass candlestick from the table and hurls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You dog ! She shoots . He falls to the floor . Oh , what have I done ? What have I done ? Covers her face . Outside a policeman 's whistle is blown twice . Lucille is still too horrified by her crime to hear it ; but Mrs. Simms-Vane smiles knowingly and closes her eyes. p. 27 MRS . SIMMS-VANE I said it would be disaster for him to cross me . He broke his agreement with me . He did not know that I could see him in the mirror over the table when he took the little stamp box . Outside the police whistle again . LUCILLE hears whistleO-oh , the police ! MRS . SIMMS-VANE And now , you are a murderess . LUCILLE running to herNo ! No ! Please save me ! MRS .

Lucille does so. p. 28 LUCILLE Oh , I do n't deserve to be saved ! MRS . SIMMS-VANE Never mind . Go put your hand in the young man 's coat pocket . LUCILLE Oh , no ! I 'm afraid to touch him ! MRS . SIMMS-VANE Do as I say . Reluctantly , Lucille goes to Miller . She starts to reach for his pocket , shudders , and recoils from him . MRS . SIMMS-VANE The right side . Lucille is startled that Mrs. Simms-Vane should know the correct pocket ; but she quickly thrusts her hand into it . Do you feel the diamonds ? LUCILLE gloatingYes ; here they are . As she lifts the stones from Miller 's pocket , she pauses , swiftly putting back a stray wisp of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you sure you have all of them ? LUCILLE Yes ! MRS .

Insistent ringing of the doorbell causes her to hasten her counting . Four , five , six  --  She quickly continues to count toward thirty . The doorbell has ceased ringing . An outside door opens and closes . A growing murmur of voices . A man exclaims , " But we heard a shot fired ! " A woman replies , " But it could n't have been here !

SIMMS-VANE Certainly . But in my necklace there were not the number of stones you counted out to me . You kept one . LUCILLE No ! No ! MRS . SIMMS-VANE Yes , you did . The necklace was given to me by my husband on my thirty-fourth , not my thirty-third , birthday . You thought I did not know the number of my own stones ; so you kept one . MILLER Ha !
