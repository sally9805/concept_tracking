txt " There will be no famine in sugar , for there is an ample supply in that commodity , " said Ilerbert C. Hoover , food administrator , in denial of a published statement , purporting to come from him , to the effect that there would be a famine in sugar by October . Mr. Hoover said " I have made no statement upon the sugar question . I did , in an important private conference . discurs the sugar question , and I said that there would be difficulty in securing sugar unless order was restored in Cuba , because of the inability to harvest the crop . " Action has been taken The harvest will be taken care of . There will be no famine in sugar , for there is an ample supply in that commodity , both from Cuba and elsewhere .
