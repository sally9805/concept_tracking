SCENE  --  A corner in the grill of the New York club of a large Eastern University . Six tables with chairs placed about them are set at regular intervals in two rows of three from left to right . On the left , three windows looking out on a side street . In the rear , four windows opening on an avenue . On the right , forward , the main entrance to the grill . It is the middle of the afternoon of a hot day in September , 1918 . Through the open windows , the white curtains of which hang motionless , unstirred by the faintest breeze , a sultry vapor of dustclogged sunlight can be seen steaming over the hot asphalt . Here , in the grill , it is cool . The drowsy humming of an electric fan on the left wall lulls to inertness . A bored , middle-aged waiter stands leaning wearily against the wall between the tables in the rear , gaping and staring listlessly out at the avenue . Every now and then he casts an indifferent glance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young man of about thirty dressed in the uniform of an officer in the Medical Corps who is sitting at the middle table , front , sipping a glass of iced coffee and reading a newspaper . The officer is under medium height , slight and wiry , with a thin , pale face , light brown hair and mustache , and grey eyes peering keenly through tortoise-rimmed spectacles . As the curtain rises there is a sound of footsteps from the entrance . The waiter half-straightens into an attitude of respectful attention . A moment later Herbert Roylston enters . He is a brawny young fellow of twenty-seven or so , clad in the uniform of a first lieutenant of infantry . Blond and clean-shaven , his rather heavy , good-natured face noticeably bears the marks of a recent convalescence from serious illness . Lines of suffering about the lips contrast with his ever-ready , jovial grin ; and his blue eyes of a healthy child seem shadowed by the remembrance of pain , witnessed and not by them to be forgotten . Roylston stands at the entrance and glances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inquiring " Yes , sir ? " . The medical officer is engrossed in some bit of news and does not look up . Roylston walks forward to his table and glances at the other curiously . Then the paper is put down and the eyes of the two men meet . A look of perplexed recognition comes over both their faces . ROYLSTON  --  ( with a boyish grin ) I know you . Wait a minute ! ( The other smiles . ) Ah ! Now I 've got it  --  Wayne , is n't it  --  Bobby Wayne ? You used to room with Jack Arnold at college . p. 3 WAYNE  --  That 's right ; and this is  --  Roylston , is n't it ? I met you here with Jack ? ROYLSTON  --  That 's who . ( The two men shake hands heartily , evidently greatly pleased at this chance meeting . ) WAYNE  --  I 'm very glad to see you again . Sit down . Wo n't you have something to drink ? ( He beckons to the waiter . ) ROYLSTON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for  --  that , and to try and find someone to talk to , and write a couple of letters . ( to the waiter ) Iced coffee , please . ( The waiter goes out . ) Its a sure enough broiler in the streets . Whew ! ( He mops his face with his handkerchief  --  then continues apologetically ) I guess I 'm still a bit weak . You know I had rather a close shave , thanks to the Bosche . WAYNE  --  ( nodding ) I can see by your face that you 've been through the mill . What was it  --  scrapnel ? ROYLSTON  --  ( with a grin ) A touch of that in both legs ; and afterward machine gun here and here . ( He touches the upper part of his chest . ) They nearly had me. ( showing emotion ) If it had n't been for Jack  --  p. 4 WAYNE  --  ( interestedly ) Eh ? You do n't mean Jack Arnold ? ROYLSTON  --  I sure do ! He came out into No Mans Land and got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  after Chateau Thierry ? ROYLSTON  --  Yes . WAYNE  --  ( astonished ) Then you were the one he brought back  --  that exploit  --  ROYLSTON  --  I do n't know about the one . I was a one , at any rate . ( with enthusiasm ) Jack 's got a whole caboodle of such stunts to his credit . I would n't dare say that I  --  WAYNE  --  ( puzzled ) But I heard  --  they did n't give the name  --  but I understood it was the body of a dead officer he risked his life to get . ROYLSTON  --  ( laughing ) I guess they did think I was a go goose at the time ; but I managed to pull through . You can put a squirrel in the ground . ( The waiter comes back bringing the iced coffee which he sets on the table . Roylston takes a sip and sighs contentedly. ) p. 5 WAYNE  --  ( when the waiter has resumed his post by the rear windows ) Tell me about it , will you , Roylston ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damn interested in all Jack does . You see Jack and I have palled together ever since we were knee-high . ROYLSTON  --  Yes . He 's told me . WAYNE  --  But he 's such a rotten correspondent that , even when I was in France , I had to depend on the war correspondents and the official reports for any news about him . So it 'd be a favor if you 'd  --  ROYLSTON  --  ( embarrassed ) There is n't much to tell . We got caught in a bit of barrage half-way to the third Bosche trench  --  we 'd captured the first two and should have stopped , but you get drunk with the joy of chasing them back and you do n't stop to think . WAYNE  --  I can understand that ! ROYLSTON  --  Well , that was where I got mine  --  in both legs . I went down and could n't get up . The boys had to go back to the trench we 'd just captured . They did n't have time to do any picking up . I must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and caught hell . Then the lights went our completely as far as I was concerned . WAYNE  --  ( eagerly ) But you 've heard how Jack 's company got cut off in that second trench , have n't you ? How the Hun barrage cut all communication between them and the rest of the army ? ( enthusiastically ) Jack 's company held out for three days and nights against all kinds of terrific shelling and counter attacks , without support or relief , until the rest of the division advanced again and caught up with them . Nearly every member of the company was either killed or wounded  --  but they stuck it out ! It was a wonderful example of what our boys can do in a pinch ! p. 6 ROYLSTON  --  It sure was great stuff ! I heard about that part of it afterward in hospital ; but at the time it all happened I was n't especially interested in what was going on around me . WAYNE  --  Then  --  When was it Jack came out to get you ? ROYLSTON  --  Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WAYNE  --  ( astonished ) That third night ? ROYLSTON  --  It was at night , I know . WAYNE  --  ( looking at him with wondering admiration ) Then  --  you were lying in No Mans Land three days and nights  --  badly wounded ? ROYLSTON  --  ( embarrassed ) I must have been , I guess . I did n't notice time much . I was sort of out of my head with thirst and pain , or in a numb trance most of the time . You know how one gets . ( Wayne nods . ) I 'd see dark and light but  --  I did n't think of anything at all  --  not even of death . ( He pauses and then continues shamefacedly . ) Finally I came to in the dark . I heard someone screaming  --  damn horribly ! I listened and discovered that I was doing it  --  screaming at the top of my lungs ! Honestly , I was ashamed to death of myself . I managed to get to my feet . I had a mad hunch to get back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rattle , and I felt a terrific thud in the chest  --  and the ground came up and hit me . The Bosche artillery loosened up and a shower of star shells made it light as day . I saw a man come running through that hell straight for me . The air was fairly sizzling with bullets but he kept right on , and then when he came close I saw it was Jack . He shouted : Roylston , and hauled me up on his shoulder . The pain of it knocked me into a faint . When I came to I was in hospital . ( with a shy grin of relief ) So that 's all I know about it . p. 7 WAYNE  --  You certainly had a frightful time of it , old man . ROYLSTON  --  No worse than the rest of the boys . We all have to take our medicine sooner or later . But its lucky for me Jack saw me stand up that time . WAYNE  --  You think he saw you ? ROYLSTON  --  ( making a wry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think he heard me balling out there . I guess they all thought me dead or they 'd have been out looking for me before that . ( He drinks the rest of his coffee . ) Well , I 've got to toddle upstairs and write  --  WAYNE  --  Wait a minute , will you , Roylston ? There 's something I want to talk over with you . It 's about Jack  --  and perhaps you can help me . ROYLSTON  --  Certainly . ( as the other hesitates ) Something about Jack , you say ? WAYNE  --  Yes . But first let me explain how I happen to be here at home . I 'm not on leave , and I was n't sent back from France on account of ill health , as you might think . At the base hospital over there I was assigned to treating victims of shell-shock . I 'd made quite a study of the disease since it first became known and as a consequence was more successful than most at treating it . So a few months ago when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was ordered back here to help on shock patients . p. 8 ROYLSTON  --  I see . WAYNE  --  ( with a keen glance at the other  --  lowering his voice ) And , this is strictly confidential , of course , it appears from a letter I recently received , as if Jack Arnold is likely to become one of my patients . ROYLSTON  --  ( amazed ) What ! Not shell shock ? WAYNE  --  Yes . ROYLSTON  --  Good God ! But there must be some mistake . Why Jack has the nerves of an ox ! WAYNE  --  Did have . Do n't forget he 's been in there three years now without a let-up  --  when you come to count the two he was with the Canadians before he was transferred to ours . That 's a long stretch . ROYLSTON  --  But the last I remember of him he was AI . WAYNE  --  It hits you all of a sudden usually ; besides , it 's by no means certain in Jacks case . The letter I spoke of was from a Doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote that Jack had been sent to the base hospital with a leg wound , nothing serious in itself . But , knowing I was a friend of Jack 's , Thompson wrote to tell me Jack had been invalided home , and for me to study him carefully when he arrived . His trouble seemed to be plain nervous break-down , Thompson said , but still there was something queer about the case he could n't get hold of and he had n't the time to devote to individuals . So he left it up to me. p. 9 ROYLSTON  --  Did n't he give you some hint as to just what he meant was the trouble with Jack ? WAYNE  --  Only a postscript evidently scribbled in a hurry . He wrote : " Watch Arnold  --  cigarettes ! "  --  with the word cigarettes deeply underlined . ROYLSTON  --  ( wonderingly ) Cigarettes ? WAYNE  --  Sounds ridiculous , does n't it ? Especially as Jack never smokes . ROYLSTON  --  ( quickly ) Oh , he did over there  --  a great deal . As I remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . WAYNE  --  ( astonished ) What ? Why , when I knew him he would n't touch one on a bet . ( The two men look at each other for a moment deeply puzzled . ) There 's something queer about it , evidently  --  from that postscript . ROYLSTON  --  ( after a moment ) Oh , I guess it 's just that your Thompson is one of those anti-cigarette fiends . WAYNE  --  ( frowning ) Quite the contrary . He smokes incessantly himself . There must be something in it . Thompson is one of our keenest diagnosticians. p. 10 WAYNE  --  ( confidently ) No matter how sharp he is I 'll bet he 's all wrong about Jack . Why  --  hell  --  Jack 's made of iron . I 've seen him in the trenches and I know . If he 'd been shot or gassed or  --  but shell shock  --  Bosh ! Jack 'd laugh at that . ( eagerly ) But when do you expect him to get here ? WAYNE  --  Any day now . ROYLSTON  --  Gad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want to see him above all other people in the world  --  to thank him , if I can , for my presence in our midst . ( impulsively ) If you only knew how I feel about Jack ! ( inconsequentially ) You remember his senior year at college when he was All-American half  --  and his touchdown that won the Harvard game ? ( Wayne nods . ) I was just a Freshman then and you can imagine what a hero he was to me . ( Wayne smiles . ) And then to go over there and find myself directly under his command  --  to become his friend ! It meant a devil of a lot , I tell you ! WAYNE  --  It must have . ROYLSTON  --  And then to cap the climax he saved my life when not one man in a million would have tried it  --  and no blame to them , either ! It was rank suicide . The chances were a thousand to one against his coming out of it alive . ( with a grin ) When I get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess I better beat it to my letter writing . Be sure and let me know when Jack arrives , I sure want to see him . p. 11 WAYNE  --  ( as they both stand and shake hands ) I 'll be sure to . ROYLSTON  --  Thanks . Well , so long for the present . WAYNE  --  So long . ( He sits down again . Roylston goes out . Wayne drums on the table with his fingers and stares before him , deep in his thoughts . After a moment steps are heard from the entrance , right , and Jack Arnold comes into the grill . He is a tall , broad-shouldered , and sinewy-built man of about thirty with black hair and mustache . The sun tan on his strong-featured , handsome face has been faded to a sickly yellow by illness . Lines of nervous tension are deep about his mouth and nose , and his cheeks are hollow , the skin drawn taut over the cheek bones . His dark eyes have a strained expression of uncertain expectancy as if he were constantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to explode . His hands tremble a little . He has a queer mannerism of continually raising the fore and middle fingers of his right hand to his lips as though he were smoking an invisible cigarette . He wears the uniform of a major of infantry . ) ARNOLD  --  ( immediately recognizes Wayne and calls out casually ) Hello , Bobby . ( He strides toward the table . ) WAYNE  --  ( jumps to his feet , nearly upsetting the table ) Jack ! ( his face glowing with pleasure as he pumps his friend 's hand up and down ) By all that 's wonderful ! When did you get in ? p. 12 ARNOLD  --  This morning . WAYNE  --  ( pushing him into a chair ) Sit down , you old scoundrel ! I 've been expecting to hear of your arrival every day . ( slapping him on the back affectionately ) It 's certainly a sight for sore eyes to see you alive and kicking again ! ARNOLD  --  Yes , I 'm glad to be back for a bit . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So Doctor Thompson wrote me . ARNOLD  --  ( betraying uneasiness ) Oh , he wrote you , did he ? WAYNE  --  Yes ; said you were coming back . ARNOLD  --  ( irritably ) He 's a fossilized old woman , your Thompson  --  fusses like a wet hen about imaginary symptoms . WAYNE  --  Yet he 's one of the best in his line . ARNOLD  --  ( dryly ) Perhaps ; but you 'll not convince me of it . ( He makes the peculiar motion of fingers to his lips . ) He got on my nerves frightfully with his incessant examinations  --  pure rot , if you want my opinion . WAYNE  --  ( with a keen professional glance at his friend 's face  --  from this time he studies Arnold as a patient ) But , honestly , you do look as if you 'd been knocked out for a time . p. 13 ARNOLD  --  ( annoyed ) No ; fit as a fiddle . ( vaguely ) It 's only the silence . ( He again makes the motion to his lips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  ( not appearing to notice this question  --  with sudden eagerness ) Have you a cigarette , Bobby ? WAYNE  --  ( takes out his case and offers it to Arnold ) You 're smoking now ? ARNOLD  --  Naturally . ( He lights the cigarette and , drawing in a deep inhale , exhales it with a sigh of relief . ) WAYNE  --  How , naturally ? You did n't use to , you know  --  nary a puff . ARNOLD  --  Had to over there . ( with sudden remembrance ) I was forgetting  --  it 's such a damn long while since I 've seen you , Bobby . WAYNE  --  Three years . ARNOLD  --  ( vaguely ) A lot of things can happen in that time , what ? ( With a detached air , as if he were unconscious of what he is doing , he puts out the cigarette from which he has hardly taken more than a few puffs , and carefully puts the butt into a pocket of his uniform. ) p. 14 WAYNE  --  ( watching him curiously ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question and stops . ) ARNOLD  --  ( sharply ) Eh ? WAYNE  --  Oh , nothing . ( as Jack stares at him ) How 's the wound in your leg ? ARNOLD  --  All O.K. Only a scratch . ( He again puts his fingers to his lips nervously  --  then his eyes fall on the cigarette case on the table . ) I 'll graft another of your fags , Bobby , if I may . WAYNE  --  Help yourself . ARNOLD  --  ( lighting up ) I went straight to your house from the dock . Saw your mother . She told me I 'd probably find you here . ( with a display of affection ) It 's good to see you again , Bobby , damn good ! Like a tonic , by Jove ! I feel bucked up already . WAYNE  --  ( with a smile ) I 'm glad of that , Jack . ARNOLD  --  ( reminiscently ) What times we used to have together , eh ? WAYNE  --  Bully ! p. 15 ARNOLD  --  Those week-ends in the city when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grinding medical stude and I was a  --  ( scornfully ) scribbler ! WAYNE  --  Have you managed to get any writing done over there ? ARNOLD  --  ( with a frown ) No . What 's the use ? It 's not a thing one can write about , is it ? ( There is a pause . Arnold mechanically puts out his cigarette and is just placing it in his pocket when he looks up and catches his friend 's eye probing into his strange action . He immediately becomes conscious of what he is doing and shame-facedly hurls his cigarette on the floor and stamps on it . ) Damn it all ! ( irritably ) What are you staring at , Bobby ? WAYNE  --  ( flushing ) Nothing  --  er  --  ARNOLD  --  You must think me a thundering ass when you catch me in a childish act like that  --  just like a kid on the streets " sniping butts " . I ca n't seem to break myself of the devilish habit  --  must have contracted it in the front line trenches  --  saving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a smoke . And now I do it mechanically  --  ( hesitates  --  then moodily in a low voice ) whenever the silence comes over me. p. 16 WAYNE  --  ( seeing his friend 's embarrassment  --  soothingly ) It 's natural enough . ARNOLD  --  ( as if he were talking to himself ) There 's something back of it I ca n't get at  --  something that drives me to do it . ( He shakes his head as if banishing some painful thought , and producing an unopened box of cigarettes from each of his pockets , turns to Wayne with a forced laugh . ) Here I 've got a full box in each pocket and yet I 'll bet I 've been grafting yours as though there was n't one for sale in the whole world . It 's a disgusting obsession . I 've got to break myself of it or people will think I 've a screw loose somewhere . It 's up to you , Bobby , to call me down every time you catch me . That 'll do the trick . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calls to the waiter roughly ) Hey , waiter ! WAITER  --  ( starting out of his doze ) Yes , sir ? ARNOLD  --  A box of cigarettes . WAITER  --  What kind would you like , sir ? ARNOLD  --  ( vaguely ) Any kind . WAYNE  --  But you 've all those unopened on the table , Jack . p. 17 ARNOLD  --  ( flushing  --  awkwardly ) Yes  --  so I have  --  I was forgetting . ( to the waiter ) Never mind about them now . ( There is a pause during which Arnold presses his hands to his forehead as if he were trying to focus his thoughts . Finally he mutters in a low voice ) It 's the silence . That does it . WAYNE  --  ( staring at him keenly ) That 's the third time you 've mentioned the silence , Jack . What do you mean , exactly ? What silence ? ARNOLD  --  ( after a pause ) Just that  --  the silence . It hits you when you 're sent back home after you 've been in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or more without a holiday . ( He laughs mockingly . ) A holiday ! A rest period ! Rest ! Good God ! ( He turns to Wayne excitedly . ) Understand that I 'm only speaking from my own experience and my feelings may have no general significance . But I believe they have . I 've seen them verified in the faces of those men who come back to the trenches after a leave at home  --  their expression of genuine happiness at being back  --  Why , man , they look relieved , freed from slavery ! ( He pauses for a moment , reflecting  --  then continues intensely . ) You 've been hearing the rumble and crash of the big guns , the rat-a-pet rivetting of the machine-guns , the crack of rifles , the whine of bullets , the roar of bursting shells . Everything whirls in a constant feverish movement around you ; the earth trembles and quakes beneath your feet ; even the darkness is only an intermittent phenomena snatching greedily at the earth between the wane of one star shell and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is goaded into insomnia by the everlasting fireworks . Nothing is fixed or certain . The next moment of your life never attains to the stability of even a probable occurrence . It hits you with the speed of a bullet , passes through you , is gone . ( He pauses . ) And then you come out into the old peaceful world you once knew  --  for a rest  --  and it seems as if you were burried in the tomb of a pyramid erected before the stars were born . Time has died of old age ; and the silence , like the old Chinese water torture , drips leadenly drop by drop  --  on your brain  --  and then you think  --  you have to think  --  about the things you ought to forget  --  p. 18 WAYNE  --  ( in a brisk voice  --  trying to rouse his friend ) You 'll get used to the quiet after a bit . You 're letting your imagination run away with you . ( Arnold looks at him with a curious , haggard smile . ) Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just talking about you with a friend of yours before you came in . Speak of the devil , you know . Guess who it was ? ARNOLD  --  ( indifferently ) I do n't know . Who ? WAYNE  --  Roylston . It 's funny you did n't run into him . ARNOLD  --  ( showing no interest  --  as if he had n't heard the name ) I saw someone in uniform going up the stairs  --  did n't get a look at his face . Who did you say it was ? WAYNE  --  ( laying emphasis on the name ) Roylston  --  Herb Roylston  --  the man you dragged out of No Mans Land after Chateau Thierry when you won your load of medals , you chump ! ARNOLD  --  ( stunned ) You do n't mean  --  Herb ? WAYNE  --  That 's exactly who I do mean . ARNOLD  --  ( pale and excited ) Here  --  in this club  --  Herb ? But that 's impossible . Herb was dead , I tell you . p. 19 WAYNE  --  You may think so ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very much alive , and he wants to see you and thank you for  --  ARNOLD  --  ( covering his face with his hands ) Oh God ! WAYNE  --  ( alarmed ) Jack ! What 's the trouble ? ARNOLD  --  ( controlling himself with an effort ) Nothing  --  only it brings it all back . ( His fingers flutter to his mouth . He murmurs hoarsely ) Got a cigarette , Bobby ? WAYNE  --  There  --  on the table . ARNOLD  --  Thanks . ( He does not touch his own boxes but picks a cigarette from his friend 's case and lights it . He takes a deep inhale and commences to talk volubly in a forced tone as if he were trying to cover up his apparent indifference in the matter of Roylston . ) I 'm damn glad to hear about Herb . So he 's alive  --  really alive ! It seems incredible . He was swimming in his own blood . I carried him over my shoulder . I was soaked with it . Ugh ! ( He shudders at the recollection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) I 'll be damn glad to see him again  --  damn glad . Herb 's a corking chap  --  one of the best . He and I were great chums over there . ( He puts his cigarette out and sticks it hastily in his pocket . Wayne sees this and seems about to speak but thinks better of it . Arnold goes on in an agitated tone . ) Yes , Herb 's one fine chap . That was an awful mess  --  the worst ever  --  that Chateau Thierry affair . I 'll have to tell you about it . We ran out of cigarettes you know  --  not a damn one in the whole company  --  not a smoke of any description . It was hell . Speaking of smokes  --  you 've another fag , have n't you , Bobby ? p. 20 WAYNE  --  ( quietly ) On the table , Jack . ARNOLD  --  Thanks . ( He again takes one from Wayne 's case and puffs nervously . ) You ca n't realize what a smoke comes to mean to you in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been there , Bobby . You wondered at my smoking now when I never had in the old days . I did n't at first  --  then I had to  --  had to , I tell you ! You know  --  the stench and the lice and the rest of it . A smoke takes your mind off them , somehow . WAYNE  --  ( soothingly ) I know it 's a good thing . ARNOLD  --  ( complainingly ) And that time in that Chateau Thierry trench there was nothing . The Bosche barrage cut us off completely from the rest of the army  --  not a smoke in the whole company ! No chance of getting one ! We only had emergency field rations and when they gave out some of the boys  --  toward the end  --  those who were still unwounded  --  were wild with hunger and thirst . I can remember Billy Sterett  --  a corporal  --  he went west with a bullet through his heart later on , poor fellow  --  singing some idiotic nonsense about beef steak pie over and over again  --  till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He must have been clean out of his head . But I did n't feel hunger or thirst at all . All I wanted was a smoke  --  and not a one ! ( He puffs furiously at his cigarette. ) p. 21 WAYNE  --  I 've read about your famous three days , Jack . It was a glorious thing but I can well imagine how terrible it was also . ARNOLD  --  ( excitedly ) Terrible ? No word for it ! Man alive , you could n't know ! We 'd crouch down in the mud with the trench rats squeaking and scampering with fright over our feet  --  nipping at your legs  --  while we waited for the next counter attack , wondering if the Bosche would get through the next time , gritting our teeth to stick it out . Their artillery played hell with us . The world seemed flying to bits . The concussions of the bursting shells  --  all about us  --  would jar your heart right back against your spine . It rained shell splinters . Men kept falling , writhing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and nothing to do . A little Italian private  --  Tony  --  he used to sing for us in camp  --  do n't know his second name  --  used to be a bootblack here at home  --  was standing near me . A shell fragment came down on his skull  --  his brains spattered all over  --  ( shuddering )  --  over my face . And all that time not a cigarette  --  not a damned smoke of any kind  --  to take your mind off  --  all that ! WAYNE  --  ( worried by Arnold 's rapidly increasing excitement ) You ought to try and forget those unavoidable horrors , Jack . War has to be what it is  --  until we make an end to it forever . p. 22 ARNOLD  --  ( waving this remark aside ) You 've got to know about it , all you others  --  then you 'll send us the things we need , smokes and the rest . ( He throws his cigarette away and lights another . ) And at nights it was frightful , expecting a surprise attack every minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pile the dead up against the rear wall of the trench ; and when you 'd stumble in the dark you 'd put your hand out and touch a  --  a face , or a leg  --  or  --  something sticky with blood . Not a wink of sleep ! You could n't ! Even when the guns let up for a moment there were the screams of the wounded out in No Mans Land . They 'd keep the dead awake  --  lying out there dying by bits . And you could n't go out to get them in that fire . It was suicide . I told the men that . They wanted to go out and get their friends , and I could n't give permission . We needed every man It was suicide . I told them so . They wept and cursed . It was my duty . They would have been killed  --  uselessly . WAYNE  --  But you went out yourself  --  for Roylston . ARNOLD  --  ( vaguely  --  shaking his head ) No ; Roylston was dead . I saw him fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days I did n't see or hear him  --  so he must have been dead . ( He hurries on volubly as if this thought of Roylston disturbed him . ) I thought I 'd go mad . No place for the wounded to be cared for  --  groans and shrieks on all sides ! And not a thing to smoke ! You had to think  --  think about it ! And the stench of the bodies rotting in the sun between the Bosche trench and ours ! God ! And not a single cigarette , do you understand ? Not one ! You 'd feel sick clear down to the soles of your feet . You finally came to believe you were putrefying yourself  --  alive !  --  and the living men around you  --  they too  --  rotten ! p. 23 WAYNE  --  ( revolted ) For heavens sake , Jack , cut it out ! ARNOLD  --  A cigarette would have been heaven  --  to fill your lungs with clean smoke  --  to cleanse the stench out of your nostrils ! But no ! Not the tiniest butt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing more and more excited ) And when the relief came  --  our boys  --  and I was weeping with the joy of it  --  and I prayed to them  --  yes , actually prayed  --  Give me a cigarette , for God 's sake ! Not a one , Bobby , do you hear ? Not a blessed one of them had any . There 'd been a delay , a mistake , something . None had come up with the supplies . I was wild . I cursed them . I suddenly remembered Roylston . He 'd given me one just before we charged . He had a whole case full I remembered , and I knew the spot where he went down  --  the exact spot . After that  --  I forget . It 's all a blank . I must have gone over the top and brought him back . ( His voice sinks to a dull whisper . He notices the half-smoked cigarette in his hand and throws it away with a gesture of loathing . ) WAYNE  --  ( gazing at him with horrified eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a cigarette  --  God ! ( As Arnold hides his face in his hands with a half-sob Wayne hastens to add compassionately ) No , it could n't have been that . Your mind is sick , old pal , do you know it ? Very sick . Come with me , Jack . Let 's get out of here . ( He gets to his feet putting his hand on his friend 's shoulder. ) p. 24 ARNOLD  --  ( getting to his feet  --  in agonized tones ) What have I been saying ? I 've never talked about it before  --  but that 's the thought that 's been eating into my brain , Bobby  --  what you just said . That 's why I 'm going mad  --  thinking about it  --  day and night ! ( with frenzied protest ) It could n't have been that ! I must have gone out for him  --  for Herb ! I must have suddenly realized that he was out there  --  still alive  --  suffering ! ( breaking down ) But how could I have known that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't remember . WAYNE  --  ( quickly ) You saw him when he stood up , of course  --  when he tried to get back to our lines . ARNOLD  --  ( hopelessly  --  with a groan ) No  --  no  --  I saw noone  --  nothing . WAYNE  --  ( forcibly ) Then you heard him screaming out there  --  screaming with pain in his delirium . Think ! ARNOLD  --  ( his eyes widening ) Screaming ? Yes  --  there was screaming  --  driving you mad  --  ( His face contracts convulsively . He beats his head with his hands , his eyes shut in his effort to visualize the scene . ) Yes  --  and then  --  God !  --  one voice  --  when all the others were silent for a second  --  like this  --  ( He throws his head back and screams as if in horrible pain. ) p. 25 WAYNE  --  ( as the waiter shrinks back against a window terrified ) Jack ! Stop ! ARNOLD  --  ( in a frenzy of joy ) I remember it all now . It was his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment we were relieved ! Then I knew he was out there alive . I could n't bear it ! That 's why I went over  --  to save him  --  Herb !  --  not the damned cigarettes ! ( His face lights up and he grabs Wayne 's hand and pumps it up and down . ) That 's why I 've been sick  --  queer  --  crazy  --  off my nut , Bobby ! They 've all been telling what a hero I was  --  and I thought I 'd done it all for  --  I could n't remember why I 'd gone for him  --  except the cigarettes  --  and they gave me medals for bravery  --  and all the time I 've been going mad  --  slowly  --  inside  --  thinking I was a damned cur ! But now I know , Bobby . I remember every bit that happened . I heard him scream  --  and I did go over to save Herb , Bobby ! Thank God ! ( He sinks down into a chair , weak but radiant . ) WAYNE  --  ( calmly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch of shock got the other fool notion into your head . ( with a grin ) And now I can dismiss your case . You 're cured already . I 'm some doctor , eh ? ( While he is speaking Roylston appears in the doorway . When he sees Jack he gives a shout of delight and rushes over throwing his arms around Arnold in a bear hug. ) p. 26 ROYLSTON  --  ( shaking him affectionately ) Hello , Jack ! ( He holds him at arm 's length  --  with embarrassment ) Here you are at last  --  I 've wanted to see you  --  to try and tell  --  to try and thank  --  damn it ! ( He fumbles in his pocket and pulls out his cigarette case which he offers to Jack . ) Its hard to speak about such things  --  but you know  --  Have a cigarette . ARNOLD  --  Not on your life ! Never another ! A pipe for mine for the rest of my life ! ( He beckons wildly to the waiter . ) Hey , waiter ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a teapot , if you have to , and pour it through a strainer . Here 's where we celebrate ! ( The astonished waiter stands gaping at him in petrified wonder as Jack grabs Herb 's hand and shakes it up and down. )
