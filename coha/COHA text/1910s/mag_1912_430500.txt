" IF you can play golf , I do n't see why I ca n't , " said a whitehaired lady of my acquaintance the other clay . She was surprised at what seemed to her an unduly prolonged enthusiasm for the noble game . When I replied that I did not think there was any age limit to prevent either of us from indulging in such a healthful practice , she observed that " men certainly play it until their latest day , " and supposed the laziness of women , rather than any physical incapacity , prevented them from following the men 's example . The American woman past forty , in my opinion , is less lazy than unwise in the arrangement of her occupations , physical activity and the practice of athletic sports being abandoned much too early in life . English women are far more active in the various sports so popular in their country . They keep their place in the hunting field , they shoot , and play golf , and even continue to play tennis far beyond the age when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ athletic sport of any kind , or even of taking any regular exercise . The practice of taking long walks is also universal among English women of all ages and conditions . In these days , when the equality of the sexes is so loudly proclaimed , it would seem that the prolongation of physical activity , which is held to be of such vital importance among men , should he equally desired by women . who hope to keep the pace in the work of the world . That lightness of foot , elasticity of muscles , cheerfulness of spirit , and a youthful appearance are prolonged by physical activity is so plain as to need no argument . Golf Develops Family Comradeship The game of golf , so admirably adapted to all ages , can also be played by women in companionship with husbands , brothers , and sons , and can therefore be most warmly recommended for the development of that mutual interest in matters pertaining to both work and play , that sense of common knowledge and comradeship , which , unfortunately , is now so lacking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American men has been greatly vaunted ; the luxury and liberty which they allow their wives have been commented on by critics of other nations , with a mixture of admiration and of reproach . It is an undoubted fact that among the gifts so freely bestowed by American men upon their wives , the best of all gifts , that of daily companionship and an honorable trust and confidence in regard to their affairs , has been too often withheld . American women may be the freest of all the women of the world , but it is greatly to be feared that they are the loneliest . A persistent pursuit of open air exercise , and of games by which they may become the antagonists of their men folk , would be the very best and happiest means of altering this unhappy condition . The growth of political consciousness in the minds of the American women , which is even now appearing like the morning sun above the horizon , would make evident the necessity of this free companionship . Education is entirely adequate to alter the emotional processes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ female kind . This tendency to judge by the emotions and govern the actions thereby , is by no means inherent in the female mind . By an almost universal law , the daughter inherits the mental qualities of the father , the sons of the mother . This being the case , in a nation of successful business men the American daughters should have a greater inheritance of virile brain than falls to the lot of European girls . If the American girl is , therefore , given the advantage of training in geometry , logic and the various coordinate studies which develop the reasoning powers during the years , of plastic adaptability , there is no reason why the American woman of the future should not be the most logical in the world . Thletics and Efjiciency of Women Signs are not wanting in the rising generation of American women of a high development of the reasoning faculties and a great efficiency in civic activity . The highest development of the American woman can not be attained without due regard to the preservation of physical activity , and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all ages .  | THE arguments of physicians and educators in favor of athletics for women were only partially successful until fashion set the stamp of approval . The hoydenish tomboy , who was the despair of the mother of the past generation , is to-day just the normal girl whose keen love for outdoor sports is the pride of the family . This development in athletics for girls and women has been very - rapid the past ten years , and the effect is clearly discernible in the schools and colleges , as well as in the homes . The old-time gymnasiums are'now considered too artificial for present needs and are being replaced by outdoor contests and folk dancing . The result naturally is a new type of American girl , new not only physically , but mentally and morally . Dr. Thomas Wood , the physical director of Barnard College , who has had plenty of opportunity to study the effect of this athletic development of women , says that " one of its benefits is to teach self-control . Wholesome play , suitable games , selected gymnastics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explains , " give to young women , as well as to young men , a part of the best preparation for the more serious work of later life . Women , as well as men , need to learn through practical experience the rules of fair play , generous treatment of rivals and opponents , merging self into cooperative effort , concentration of power , and the blending of all energies toward an impersonal goal . " He quoted a woman of experience who had  | said : " There is no training which girls need so much as that which develops a sense of honor and loyalty to each other , and games will do more to make these living qualities than the ethical system taught in a college curriculum . It takes the finest kind of courage to be fair , to be honest and to be loyal , and these are absolutely necessary in good team work . " Some eminent authorities , on the other hand , are opposed to the more strenuous forms of exercise indulged in to-day . They contend that the publicity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their influence , and that overexercise is apt to lead to degeneracy of muscle , once the sports are abandoned , as is so often the case with men athletes who have suffered physical decline . Women Now Expert at Polo But the women contestants are far more interested in wresting honors from their male competitors than in the ethics of the movement . No sport is too reckless , too daring , or too strenuous for the more experienced among athletic American women . For several years they have followed the example of their English sisters and have ridden to the hounds fearlessly and with a zest which has brought at least one of their number in at the death , and often the claimant of the brush . It is only natural that such intrepid and superb horsewomen should desire to emulate the example of their brothers and direct their energies to the polo field . Miss Eleanora Sears , of Boston , perhaps the best known woman athlete in this country , inaugurated the polo idea ( luring a recent trip to California . Miss Emily Randolph , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the East , and last summer captained a team at Narragansett Pier . On an opposing team Miss Kitty Penn-Smith , of Philadelphia , was a clever player . So great was the enthusiasm aroused among other daring horsewomen that Mrs. Thomas Hastings organized this summer a team to play at the Meadow Brook Hunt Club on Long Island . Other members of the team include Mrs. Reginald Brooks , who , as Miss Langhorne , was reared " in the saddle " in her Virginia home ; Mrs. Thomas Hitchcock , who rides as recklessly as her two daughters , the Misses Celestine and Ethel Hitchcock ; Mrs. W. Butler Duncan ; Mrs. Harold C. Phipps ,  | and Miss Emily Randolph . Applications , however , have been received from Boston , Philadelphia and Washington , and it is planned to organize teams in all of these cities for intercity matches . Despite the growing popularity of the automobile as a means of quick locomotion , the horse has not lost favor in the realm of sports . America now vies with England in the number of skilled horsewomen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the Horse Show held just outside of Philadelphia this summer , one day was devoted to women , the women judging as well as riding and riving blue-blooded horses . In the South and West , as well as in the East , the women have captured many a blue ribbon from male exhibitors . Miss Katherine Elkins is one of the most brilliant horsewomen in Washington , riding  | to the hounds and exhibiting in all the large shows . Washington can also claim Miss Jeannette Allen , whose equestrian feats rival those of professional riders . Miss Allen is the daughter of an army officer , and was taught the rudiments of horsemanship by cavalrymen , who delighted in her prowess , even at the tender age of three years . She was asked to ride with Mrs. Herbert Wadsworth on her ninety-mile tour . So skillful is Miss Mary Algood Jones , of Atlanta , Ga. , in her handling of horses that Mr. Alfred Vanderbilt asked her to exhibit his horses at the Madison Square Garden Horse Show in New York . Miss Jones has won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another successful horsewoman in Atlanta is Miss Charles Owen , who won the beautiful jewel trophy at the latest Atlanta Horse Shoe- . Miss Carolyn Hulbert is one of the mo . t daring riders in Louisville , Icy. , following the hounds with the zest and enthusiasm of the men . The climate in California is ideal for life in the open , and there the majority of women are interested in various athletic sports . Miss Ellen Bent , of Los Angeles , has a passion for horses . Seated on her Mexican saddle she is ready for any undertaking , not even daunted in the mountains , where the trails are so difficult that no valley horse would take them . Another well-known California sportswoman is Mrs. Malcolm Whitman , who before her marriage in July was Miss Jennie Crocker . She is equally at home on horseback and on the golf links . Her skill in handling horses made her an enthusiastic participant of the polo practice games on the Country Club field . Mrs. H. Bellamy , of Denver , who is better known by her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the high-jumping classes of the Denver Horse Show while she was only a schoolgirl . Her most thrilling adventure , however , occurred when she " rode the round-up " in Rout t Country , Colorado . Sharing her interest in athletic pursuits is Miss Marjorie Perry , also of Denver , whose hobbies are hunting and fishing . Every year during the game season she accompanies her father on a hunting  | trip into the wilds of Colorado , often remaining in the saddle twelve or fourteen hours at a time . No horse show in Chicago is complete without an exhibition by Mrs. Prentiss Coonley . Mrs. Hendricks Whitman , who was Miss Adelaide ChatfieldChatfield Taylor before her marriage in June , is a Chicago girl whose prowess in athletics is known all over the country . Mrs. Whitman , who is a niece of Mrs. Reginald de Koven , is an expert horsewoman , a wonderful swimmer , and a splendid tennis and golf player . The excitement of driving a high-power car has interested many sportswomen . Miss Frances Griscom , of Philadelphia , who previ ously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States , was among the first women to drive a car . Miss Seymoura Hadden is the youngest girl in New Orleans to drive a family automobile . In addition to being her own chauffeur , she is an expert swimmer and horsewoman , and can sail a boat as successfully as any man can . Miss Regina Rambo , of Marietta , is one of the few society girls in Amiercan who is qualified to dive a touring car in important competitive runs and to make all the re . pairs on a machine . Three years ago she cane into national prominence by running a car over the exceptionally trying court of the so-called National Highway from New York on to Atlanta , making the run with a perfect score Although journeys to the clouds have been essayed by only to boldest of men , them are scores of athletically inclined women who are anxious - make ascents . Miss Eleanora Sears , who might well t termed the leads r in athletic events of every description , was one the first women to to this exhilarating sport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she was again on terra firm : Miss Violet Ridgway , of Philadelphia is another fearless young woman who made her first journey in a balloon , then later in an aeroplane . In Washington , Miss . Gladys Hinckley was the first girl to drive an aeroplane , having taken lessons from the late Wilbur Wright . It is reported that Miss Hinckley is planning to import French machine in which she can fly over the city . Miss Harriet Quimby is American who has performed the daring feat of flying across the English Channel , thus arousing the admiration of foreign nations , as well as own . Since its introduction , ' now more than two decades ago golf has been the favorite pastime of Americawomen who delight in outdoor sports and yet do not care to indulge in the more daring  | forms of exercise . America has , therefore , developed many players of first ranll who compete favorably with the English and Scotch women who handle golf sticks with their play-toys . The Misses Curtis , of Boston , are strong , hardy players @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wells is another Boston woman in the star class . Both Philadelphia and New York have strong teams , from which members are selected for the Eastern team which competes each year with a picked Western team . In California , as well as in the East , golf is a very popular game . One of the best known golfers is Mrs , J. V. Eliot , of Pasadena , champion of Southern California and Coronado . She has been deemed so proficient that she has enjoyed the unique privilege of playing in the men 's tournaments at the Annandale Country Club , where she has twice carried off the honors over the heads of a large field of men players . Miss Edith Chesebrough , of San Francisco , is a steady , sure golf player who has won many championships in the north and south . Besides being a golf champion , Miss Chesebrough has attained distinction as a horsewoman , and excels in swimming and tennis . Another sport in which many California women are interested is hockey . This game , so dearly loved by Englishwomen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of Santa Monica . She interested Mrs. Ethel Bruce , who was one of the famous Sutton sisters , Mrs. Kelson and Mrs. Widdewson . From this small beginning three first-class teams have developed , besides the teams in the surrounding cities . The Misses May and Florence Sutton have played on the team , but the former nave it up , declaring that it was hard on her ankles . Miss May Sutton 's former title as tennis champion of the United States in women 's singles has earned for her a position in the front rank of American athletic women . Another champion tennis player is the tireless ' Miss Eleanora Sears , who is affectionately known by her friends as " Tommy . " Mrs. Barger Wallach , who is active in arranging the tennis tournaments at Newport , is likewise a strong player , as is Miss Edith Roche , of Boston . Miss Mary Shreve Lyons is sure to carry off the cups offered in all the tennis tournaments in the vicinity of Louisville . The surprise of the tennis world was sprung by Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who captured all of the championship tit titles at the annual national tennis tournament held early this summer on the grounds of the Philadelphia Cricket Club . As Miss Hazel Hotchkiss , also a Calfornian , ( lid not defend the title she had won the year previous , Miss Browne did not have the pleasure of vanquishing her , but she did wrest the cup from the redoubtable Miss Eleanora Sears . Not only did Miss Browne win the woman 's tennis championship of the United States , but she was one of a pair who carried off the honors in the championship doubles , and with her partner took the championship in  | mixed doubles from Miss Sears and Mr. Clothier . Such a cornering of all the tennis prizes was first successfully accomplished last year by Miss Hotchkiss . One of the most unusual feats accomplished by an American young woman in the realm of " higher " athletics was the scaling of Mt . Blackburn , in Alaska , by Miss Dora Keen , of Philadelphia . Miss Keen , who is the daughter of the wellknown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climbing in Switzerland four years ago . She has successfully negotiated practically all of the well-known peaks in the Alps , and is now so well acquainted with the difficult Swiss mountains that she can " personally conduct " parties . Although Miss Keen was marooned beyond the 12 , - 000 foot level of Mt . Blackburn , she was finally able to continue the climb and plant her standard on the peak , 16,400 feet above sea level . Few of the Alaskan mountain climbers , nine dogs and eight sleds . By traveling from daylight ( at about 3.30 o'clock each morning ) until the snow got too soft ( about nine o'clock ) , the party finally reached the height of 12,400 feet . For shelter they trusted to digging caves which had an average temperature of 16 degrees below zero ; for food they ate dried fruits , cheese , chocolate , powdered milk , and sausage . The storms delayed them for many days at a time ; but , dangerous though they were , they were not to be feared so much as ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force nothing could withstand . So severe were the climatic conditions that the men deserted singly and in pairs until only two men and none of the dogs remained with Miss Keen to finish the trip . As this brave trio neared the top , only night travel was friends whom Miss Keen left behind her in their comfortable homes have any realization of the hardships endured , even gloried in , by this fearless young woman . The start was made from Kennecott , Alaska , on April 22 of this year , with seven sturdy possible . Miss Keen tells how she did three inches at a time , on her knees , for five days before she was able to plant her standard on the peak . The descent was quite as dangerous as the ascent , because the heat of the day opened the crevasses all around them , and they would probably have been swallowed up- or swept away had they remained a few days longer . This hazardous expedition was no sooner  | completed than Miss Keen started on an equally thrilling and interesting trip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the virgin forests , and over a ragged glacier . Always there were plenty of moose , caribou , and bears to shoot . At the White River the horses were sent back , timber whipsawed , a boat built , and a trip of several weeks down the Yukon River was then undertaken . Miss Keen believes that mountain climbing is well worth while in itself , outside of any scientific records that may be made , because it offers the greatest and most uplifting experiences of any form of sport . In it she finds development of mental , moral , and physical strength ; she finds spiritual inspiration to a degree that gives a new vision of life , a realization of the plan and forces of the world , a feeling of being made thereby a finer , nobler woman , wishing only to be worthy of the sights she has been permitted to see , and to serve in like manner as it has been permitted to her to receive , Whether the sport is mountain-climbing or any of the many other athletic pursuits mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it is in friendly contest that the American woman will develop the finer qualities of loyalty , courage , justice and good camaraderie which has made the American sportsman a much-admired individual .  |
