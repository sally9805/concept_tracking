txt IN RE REPINGTON . Observations on the Decline of Military Criticism in England . Generally speaking , the military critic as such no longer cuts the figure in the estimation of the London public that he did in the early days of the war . In those days he was somebody indeed i The public knew nothing whatever about war , even less , if that were possible , than they know now , and as war had become the sole serious interest in life , the demand created the supply , and military critics sprang up like mushrooms on a sunny day after a rainy night . Military criticism had come into its own , and who should blame its practitioners if they made the most of the belated harvest . What was lost to the smoking rooms of service clubs was a gain to Fleet Street and West End afternoon tea tables . They were fought for and over by editors and hostesses for all the world like prima donnas or successful arctic explorers . No smart hostess was worth her salt who could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and every editor was acutely aware that the making or breaking of his circulation might depend upon his choice of the man ' in whose hands to place his military columns . And let it be conceded to this agreeable and lusty swarm of military critics that , while in the event the bulk of their criticism proved to lack everything that made for military knowledge , military potentiality , and military truth , their writings interested while they misled and entertained while they confused . In a word , the dear fellows made excellent journalists and were rich in pleasant inventions . They would make little pre-Raphaelite drawings to illustrate their theories or clarify their predictions , whereon caterpillars would represent mountains , cenanedes railways , and notes of acclamation big guns . The merest schoolgirl was made to understand by what means the pentup flow of Russian soldiers would pour over the Carpathians and overrun the Hungarian plains beyond , or how the enemy line in Flanders was to be cut and its broken flanks buckled up ; and by thin artless traffic many a simple suburban home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where is that noble and entertaining band now ? To tell the humiliating truth , most of them are out of business and military criticism has fallen from its high estate . Some one said once , " Never prophesy unless you know " ; but apparently he was not overheard by the military writers under consideration , who continued to hurtle their specious optlmisms at the head of a growingiy bewildered and disappointed public until the game was up and they were constrained to retire in broken order on the Service Club smoking rooms . Not so  --  far otherwise , indeed ! ? with Lieut . Col. Charles A'Court Repington . There was nothing of the mushroom about him  --  again far otherwise ! He had been military critic for The London Times for several years before the war broke out , and , like most men who exchange the sword for the pen , was a fierce fighter , indeed ! Nor , to do him bare justice , could he be accused of optimism . " On the contrary , quite the reverse , " as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one may so express it with the deepest respect , was Jovian . And why not ? Is not The Times itself Jovian , and could its Repington be less ? He wrote as one who should say , " Do what I tell you and all will be well ; otherwise . God have mercy upon you . " In how far the matter of his contributions justified this lofty attitude I am unable to say , as , to my deep regret , I was unable to devote to them that meticulous attention which they doubtless merited . What is more to my present purpose , which rightly considered is mostly psychological , is that though Jovian as a military critic the gallant Lieutenant Colonel as a social being was not disdainful of the tea table . Therein I count myself fortunate , for was I not on a certain afternoon of those unforgettable days bidden to a tea party at which the military critic of The Times was to appear as the principal guest ? Can it be doubted that I went ? Our hostess was an extremely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and as full of knowledge of the high thoughts , doings , and intentions of high personages in high places as an egg is full of meat ! There were several ladies present , but with the exception of the principal guest I was the ' only mere man to appear . Among the ladies there seemed to be an atmosphere of subdued but pleasurable excitement and expectancy . One gathered that they expected to hear State secrets . The Lieutenant Colonel was imposing if studiously subdued . He wore the air of one who bears imperial burdens . For my Fart , I soon found a chair , and , firmly intrenched behind a cup of tea and a muffin , I awaited the event with lively interest . Presently a lady ventured a remark , which was promptly capped by another lady , whereupon our hostess , after an anxious glance at the great man , said " Hush , darling , the Lieutenant Colonel is about to become vocal , " or words to that effect . After a momentary pause the Lieutenant Colonel made some extremely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the course of which lie clearly indicated that things would have been otherwise than thus had his advice been followed . When he had finished and had retired in great gloom into the nearest window , I cleared my throat with a view of making what I considered a military observation , but I was quickly frowned down by our delightful hostess . Her looks plainly said , " Not a word , I beg . The great man is thinking . His falcon gaze is piercing the future , " or words to that effect . It were ill and dangerously done to get between a man and his pose ; but as I crept with careful haste down the staircase I had no regrets , as I was able to reflect with gratitude on the accessibility of the truly great . Well , many moons have passed and one is grateful to learn that Lieut . Col. Charles A'Court Repington is still to the fore . But it is an unmuzzled Repington that we now behold . We learn that he has won freedom from The Times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give thanks for these mercies to the proprietor and editor of The Morning Post . We do ! We do ! Even if we do n't know why ! Replying to his critics , ho says : " I left The Times because I did not consider that the interests of the country and of the army were safe in their bands . " In whose hands is not specified , but personal nobility is clearly indic'ated . I admit that the roarings of the unmuzzled lion , are a little " white , " the merest shade , what they call " on the soft palate , " and that one searches in vain for something in criticism novel , startling , or greatly daring ; something that might win for the writer , as he hints , a position on the wrong side of prison bars .. No such luck , indeed  --  by which I mean , of course , to express the purely personal opinion that the martyr 's crown is not likely in the near future to become on intimate terms with the dome-like brow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above . We learn , too , with much relief , that the gallant Lieutenant Colonel has " the greatest . confidence In President Wilson " and " a very real respect for General Persbing 's personality , " and we are solemnly hidden to remember Lord Kitchener 's advice and " take long views . " Herein surely is the unmuzzling of this great man amply justified , and one is duly grateful  --  if a little weary . AN OLD LONDONER .
