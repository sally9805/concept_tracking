txt Tus , th CAIN was not an idealist , but Mr. SCHWAB rejoices that he is one . With right he declared that a man was fulfilling his artistic instincts if he was doing a fine thing because it was a fine thing , and that a man who in an age of industry devoted himself to industry for industry 's sake was expressing himself in trade , just as ANGEL ? and SHARESPEARE expressed themselves in art and literature . Mr. ScswAs 's expression of himself in iron and steel is something of which he has a right to he proud , and his country with him . There has been nothing sordid about it . Time and again lie has repudiated opportunities of profit for the sake of his ideal , and his ideal is one of the guarantees of his country 's prosperity and security . It is not a little thing that he pays I 70,000 workers over $70,000,000 annually , and carries their welfare on his conscience . For another man that might be a life work . But Mr. SCHWAB is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's culmination is ahead of him . Behind him de greater accomplishments than his dreams , and ho is still a dreamer of dreams which come true . Already he has organized a war plant larger by half than that which sustains Germany 's arms . He is putting something like five millions into a gun plant from which he has no hope of profit , and he offers to work his establishment in Government service at prices fixed by the Government , or to tender his plant to the Government in case of need . His profits from war products have come from abroad , but his aspiration is to lead in works of peace . He looks to the time when the twenty-five parts of his plant shall be devoted four parts to shipbuilding , twenty parts to commercial work , and only the remaining twenty-fifth part to military products . He never could have accomplished such things If he had not been a seer . a man of vision , like that other wonder of the steel trade , CARNEG/E . He was chiefly a financier , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , also a great producer of partners as well as of iron and steel , but he is also a blacksmith in the nth degree . He is the man who made it possible for CARNEGIE in the dark days of the nineties to tell the British Iron and Steel Institute that the United States could produce three pounds of steel for a penny . Those were truly the days of small things , small costs , small profits , small wages , small product , small hopes . It was in those dark clays that SCHWAB was a prophet as well as a producer . It was in 1880 that he became one of CARNEGIE 'S " boys , " and in no year since that time has he ceased to urge the enlargement of ourbasic industry . In 1880 this country consumed about one million tons of steel . In the early and dark nineties it was consuming 16,000,000 , and in 1910 he thou4litpit Would need 25 ; 0002- 000 .

It is the cold calculation of a man who knows more about the business than any other alive .
