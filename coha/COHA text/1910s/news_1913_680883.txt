txt Negotiations between Attorney General and the NeweYork , New Haven &; Hartford Railroad Company to-night reached a stage where predictions were confidently made in official circles that actual litigation would be avoided and ' hat ' the New Haven would effect a complete reorganization , divorce its steamship , trolley , and railroad holdings , and bring itself entirely within the Government 's interpretation of the Sherman Anti-Trust act . No agreement has been entered into between the Department of Justice and the railroad , and the reorganization talk originated with the New Haven . Unless unexpected difficulties arise , however , within the next few weeks , the department will appear before some United States District Court and ask for an " agreed decree , " to which the New Haven would express consent The practice in such cases has been 11 for the court to ratify suet an agreement . If the custom were followed the . years of litigation which would be necessary to carry a case against the railroad through the District Court and the Supreme Court would be avoided . Under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to carry out its agreement , and if it complied in the time fixed further civil proceedings under the Sherman saw would not be undertaken . Important Conference Held . The whole New Haven problem was gone over in great detail to-day at a conference held by the Attorney General , Howard Elliott , Chairman of the Board of the New Haven ; E. D. Robins , its general counsel ; Edgar J : Rich . general counsel , for the Boston &; Maine ; L. S. Stores , Vice President of the trolley , lines , and John W. Crim , counsel for . the ? New Haven . After . - an hour withethe Attoriffeee- Generalthe railroad representatives talked for two hours more with T. W. Gregory and Jesse C. Adkins , assistants who investigated the case for the Department of Justice . The case has been put largely in the hands of Mr. Gregory and Mr. Adkins , and if they are satisfied with New Haven offers , it is probable that the Attorney General will uphold their decision . The conference will be continued to-morrow and may last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Attorney General would provide : For a. separation of the New Haven and the Boston &; Maine Railroads . For a separation of the New Haven and its trolley lines in Maseachusetts , Rhode Island , and other States . ? For a relinquishment by the New Haven of its control of steamship lines , seine of which are held by the department to compete for the New York-Boston traffic . For the nullification of the New Haven 's agreement with the Boston &; Albany Railroad . The acceptance of such a plan would not prevent the department from resorting to criminal prosecution under the Sherman law the New Haven of -- ficials and Directors who held office when the New Haven combined these transportation systems . The question of indictments has been talked over at the department , but no final decision has been reached . The Directors and officials who have assumed office recently would not be prosecuted . Confidence in New Regime . One fact that has made it difficult to determine the course to be pursued has been the belief of department officials that many of the acts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not directly by officials , although they were passed upon by them . Attorney General has taken the position that the new management of the New Haven evidently is trying to do everything possible to bring the system within the law . He has been told by Mr. Elliott that the acts which the department holds unlawful were committed years ago and that the new Board of Directors has a majority of new men who were not concerned with such acts . Mr. Elliott has not criticised former Directors , but has tried to show that the new officers will remedy conditions . One argument which has had weight with department officials is that time should be given to the New Haven to dispose of its outside transportation holdings . The officials have been told that the New Haven needs money , and they realize that to compel the road to dispose of several big transportation systems in double - quick order would put it in a delicate situation . Any reasonable amount of time asked for by the New Haven probably would be granted if Chairman Elliott and his assistants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Palling Off in Revenues . The net revenue of the New Haven for the three months ended Sept. 30 , Mr. Elliott showed to Mr. had fallen off $2 412,000 as compared with same period last year . At the same time the reduction by the Government of express rates had cut revenues of the system by $400,000 , the Parcel Fost system had made other reductions In revenue , and the demand by the New York Public Service Commission for a reduction of commutation rates on the New Haven was having its effect on the finances of the road . To compel the New Haven to sell its wouproperties at this time , he pointed out , ld work a hardship . Many of the trolley roads , he said , had been bought at high prices . They could not be , sold for the same prices now , and a forcer sale would make them go ac ruinously low figures . Some of the trolley fines , Mr. Elliott urged , were good feeders to the system , but the greater part of ' them were run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Haven , he thought , Would be better off to part with them ..
