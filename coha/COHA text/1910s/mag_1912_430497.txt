Much more unanimity of opinion is likely to obtain in regard to George Meredith 's excellence as a letter-writer than has existed in regard to his significance as novelist and poet . For the qualities which tended to obscure his art are scarcely an obstacle in his correspondence ; and certain attractive personal qualities which tended to be obscured by his art lend the Letters a singular fascination . Of chief importance to the general reader , no doubt , will be the fact that Meredith is a fellow of infinite faculty for being interesting in detail . It is not improbable , therefore , that the Letters will have a fate the reverse of that which fell upon the author 's early works , ? the fate of considerable popularity , attended , perhaps , by considerable over-estimation of the book 's ultimate value . Consideration of that value will be incidental , in the present review , to an examination of the autobiographic aspect of the Letters ; since , whatever else may be said of them , they are bound to have an exceptional present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revelation has been in no degree forestalled : a straight road lies before the Letters across the somewhat meandering ways of Meredithian biography ( if the term be at all pertinent ) and interpretative criticism . These , to be sure , have widely traversed the country of our author 's personality ; but they have been singularly unsuccessful in opening up the central region of it . Nor has the reason for that failure been properly stated in Mr. Hammerton 's " George Meredith in Anecdote and Criticism , " which has hitherto been our chief authority on the subject : " His personality is mountainous ; and who has ever read a description of Mont Blanc or Vesuvius that would serve for all the seasons or all its phases of one ( lay , one hour even ? " Rather is it true that the several brilliant surfaces of that personality have been peculiarly reflective of certain present-day lights , and the resultant dazzle has obscured its clear outlines . Meredithian " biography " has therefore been unusually vivid and external ; typical of it is Mr. Hammerton 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , drawn , and " newspapered . " Criticism , at the same time , has been too busy estimating the good , or evil , significance of Meredith 's various reflections of our age to lay bare his entity . So that while a fairly definite conception has arisen of the central purport of Meredith 's younger contemporaries ? Swinburne , Stevenson , Hardy ? his own remains hazy . From the numerous articles about him , even from the different chapters of single books , one may derive quite divergent notions . These , very roughly speaking , may be reduced to two general impressions . According to the one , Meredith is something of a Mont Blanc ? if one may thus twist Mr. Hammerton 's handy imagery ; and according to the second , something of a Vesuvius . In the one picture , our author wears an appearance of almost classic calm , ? at the least , he towers considerably above the swift complexity of nineteenth century life ; whatever of this quality appears in his mode of expression is but a cloud border , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , glowing with ripe intellectual discernment . In the other picture , the subject is quite volcanically restless with his burden of leading thought-tendencies of the time ; above , the heavens are somewhat obscured , and yet what an admirable mouthpiece , ? what a " spiritual " mouthpiece , if one 's fancy can compass the image , ? our sturdy Vesuvius is of Her on whom we should chiefly rest our hopes , Mother Earth " that can not stop , Where ever upward is the visible aim . " These two impressions , if traced to their original sources , are seen to derive ? again very roughly speaking ? from two corresponding divisions of Meredith 's works , dealing respectively with man in relation to society and with man in relation to nature . The first group includes of course the novels , but also a large number of the poems ; its ground-tone is sounded by the " Ode to the Comic Spirit . " The other comprises the nature poetry , typical of which is the greater part of " A Reading of Earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mont Blanc , ceasing to be " mountainous , " becomes the nucleus of a singularly gifted and effective personality ; the other appears simply as an active mode of this . Probably no previous author 's letters have been more constantly related to his works than are Meredith 's to his novels . To be sure , as his editor admits , " many of his intimate friends , and a large number of his letters to them , do not for various reasons appear here at all " ; and one must hope that certain important links will be supplied in time . Yet not only is the cor- respondence in its present form comprehensive covering practically all of the author 's produc tive years , but it involves an interesting series of persons , places , and events made use of in the novels . The fact that the novels were resolutely allusive to contemporary social conditions has thus worked to the advantage of the Letters : the writer has constantly an artistic and philosophic interest , as well as a personal one , in his correspondents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gordon ( later Mrs Ross ) , to Frederick Maxse , and to William Hardman we find much of that range of obser vation which stimulated the creation not merely of Rose Jocelyn , Nevil Beauchamp , and Blackburn Tuckham but of three general charactertypes prominent in the novels as a whole and holding keystone positions in Meredith 's social theory . At the same time we are shown , in the concrete , the temperamental affiliations and contrasts between those types of character and our author himself . To each of the three friends he turns a distinct and important side of his nature . To Janet he is always " your poet , " humorously admitting the larger admixture of air and fire in his own constitution . The contrast , which reminds the reader vaguely of that between Rose Jocelyn and Evan Harrington , crops out in connection with many topics ? for instance , the Royal Academy exhibit : " Leighton has a ' Paola and Francesca ' ; painted just as the book has dropped and they are in no state to read more . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common sentiments in art . I greatly admire it . I think it the sole English picture exhibiting passion that I have seen . " The fact that comparatively few letters to Mrs. Ross and other of his women friends appear in the collection will be regretted by those who think of Meredith chiefly as the creator of Rose , Diana , and all the others in whom blood and judgment are so well commingled ? or get themselves commingled through hard experience . Apropos of Diana , one is interested to find an already known circumstance phrased as follows : " I am just finishing at a great pace a two-volume novel , to be called ' Diana of the Crossways ' ? partly modelled upon Mrs. Norton . But this is between ourselves . I have had to endow her with brains and make them evidence to the discerning . I think she lives . " This was written on March 24 , 1884 ; and the reader who has ground his teeth over the close of that novel , will experience some malicious joy when he comes across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My ' Diana ' still holds me ; only by the last chapter ; but the coupling g of such a woman and her man is a delicate business . She has no puppet-pliancy . The truth being , that she is a mother of Experience , and gives that dreadful baby suck to brains . I have therefore a feeble hold of her ; none of the novelist 's windingup arts avail ; it is she who leads me . " The numerous letters to Maxse are in several ways at once the most appealing and the most illuminating in the collection . They are enlivened by Meredith 's brusque , incisive criticisms of his friend when the two differ in opinion on such various matters as art , the liquor question , or the government of Ireland , ? on one occasion , " The hero of Beauchamp 's Career just bears with me , so stiffly have his bristles been rubbed up by the Irish . " Always , however , Meredith 's deep-seated affection for the other is apparent , especially when he is concerned about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arose when , near the beginning of their intercourse , Maxse fell in love , informed Meredith , and received in reply just such a letter of advice as one can imagine Nevil Beauchamp , mad for Renee , receiving from our author . That Meredith had Maxse in mind also when creating Harry Richmond is intimated in the following : " I have just finished the History of the inextinguishable Sir Harry Firebrand of the Beacon , Knight Errant of the 19th century , in which mirror you may look and see ? My dear Fred and his loving friend , GEORGE MEREDITH . " But the type of the extremist , who is likely to run unwittingly into egoism , embraces both of these characters and is of cardinal importance in the majority of the novels . With the attempt , into which his social insight led him , to isolate that egoism in a single character , Meredith was dissatisfied , ? he says of " The Egoist " : " It is a Comedy with only half of me in it , unlikely therefore to take either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I warned you that I am cursed with a croak . " A perfect complement to the Maxse letters is provided by those to Hardman , dubbed " Tuck " by Meredith in allusion to the friar of earthly disposition , and characterized as follows : " A dangerous man , Sir , for he tempteth us to love this life and esteems it a cherishable thing : yet , withal , one whom to know once is to desire ever . For indeed such a one is seldom seen . " The writer 's comments on Hardman send our thoughts not only to Blackburn Tuckham but to Redworth , Matey Weyburn , and other allround , commonsense personages who frequent the novels . In outline these characters loom up , indeed , behind the glowing haze of the nature poems ; for surely they are the favorite " sons " framed by Earth to " read " her , and successful  | in doing so if they acquire the requisite infusion of " spirit " ? a quality which , when one turns a prosaic eye on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is of only occasional significance in the Letters ; certainly , it was not essential to Tuck 's attractiveness for Meredith . " Tuck , Sweet Charmer , tell me why I 'm at ease when you are by ? Have you had ' a round ' with Care , Left him smoshen , stript him bare , That he never more can try Falls with me when you are by ? Ah , but when from me you ' re screened , Attrobiliad glows the fiend : Fire is wet and water dry : Candles burn cocked hats awry : Hope her diamond portal shuts , Grim dyspepsia haunts my ? Ahem ! " Beneath the surface of these verses , and of many scattered passages in the Letters , one catches glimpses of inward battles , not merely with dyspepsia but with the universe ? with the universe , our author himself would phrase it , as seen through the eyes of " that old dragon , self . " And one is enabled to realize the extent to which self-experience was the ground where grew that doctrine of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The reader of those works would scarcely suspect the existence of the tendency referred to in the following passage , contained in a letter to Maxse and sounding , for his benefit , the characteristic note of admonishment previously mentioned : " As regards Hawthorne , little Meredith admits that your strokes have truth . I strive by study of humanity to represent it : not its morbid action . I have a tendency to do that , which I repress : for , in delineating it , there is no gain . In all my , truly , very faulty works , there is this aim . Much of my strength lies in painting morbid emotion and exceptional positions ; but my conscience will not let me so waste my time . " This conscience of Meredith 's , potentially beneficent in an age in which sentiment born of romance had become the foster-sister of science , was what primarily drew him to the like of Hardman . Incidentally , the letters to " Tuck " overflow with the rich joviality and rollicking nonsense which made Box Hill the resort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leslie Stephen . Concerning his reproduction of Stephen in Vernon Whitford ? another of Earth 's favorite sons ? Meredith 's own words are : " It is a sketch of L. Stephen , but merely a sketch , not doing him full justice , though the strokes without and within are correct . " Such , briefly indicated , are the main highways on which our author gathered the stuff of his novels . Also numerous side-paths , many of them leading to illuminating discoveries , will tempt the reader of the Letters . Another chapter , the one most stimulative of thoughtful laughter , is the series of epigrammatic judgments passed by the writer on contemporary authors . It is safe to say that no other one of them had at once such a real sympathy for his fellow-craftsmen and such a shrewdly critical perception of the net significance of their works . Over-boisterous , indeed , becomes the critique of the " Idylls of the King " ; but then , two poets have seldom been temperamentally more antipathetic than were the Poet Laureate and Meredith . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evinces , incidentally , the characteristic difference of outlook between the two friends . Briefer , and often better , are the remarks on Carlyle , Mill , Ruskin , Swinburne , Rossetti , Morris , Stevenson , Hugo , and several writers of lesser note . One may at first wonder at his keen championship of Carlyle , considering that , in regard to their fundamental attitudes toward life , they stand at opposite poles . Carlyle , as Meredith puts it in a sonnet on the occasion of the seer 's eightieth birthday , " bared the roots of life with sight piercing " ; but , as Meredith writes elsewhere , " when he descends to our common pavement ? he is no more sagacious nor useful nor temperate than a flash of lightning in a grocer 's shop . " On the other hand , it is exactly on the surface of " our common pavement , " with its fringe of nature , that Meredith himself is most sagacious and temperate ; for him , surely , the pavement was all too solid , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intemperately , in his nature poems have on the whole been dragged in from the fringe and not dug up from below . In short , if Carlyle partly aspired to become a critic of society and remained a seer , Meredith more fully aspired to become a seer and remained a critic of society : the course of his development in this respect may be followed through numerous instances in the Letters , especially when these are placed side by side with his nature poetry . This very aspiration of Meredith 's , however , was undoubtedly what made him feel an affinity with Carlyle . The same extraordinary range and keenness of intellectual vision which enabled him to steer free of most nineteenth century excesses except the scientific one , and to survey this more fruitfully than could the romantic Tennyson and Browning on the one hand , or his humanitarian younger contemporaries on the other ? the same vision caught  | glimpses of spiritual heights which " Earth " had not framed him for climbing . His somewhat Vesuvian attempts , in his nature poems , to mix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon her bosom and by heaving her skyward to meet them halfway ? are accountable for that secondary picture of him , mentioned near the beginning , which one finds in biography and criticism . It has been the aim of this review to indicate how that portrait blends with the other " too too solid " one , also previously described , in the pages of the Letters . And the student of these will be able to trace the true picture through many details more intimately autobiographic than those which have here been dealt with . For in spite of the editor 's modest assurance that " the collection is not meant to form a narrative of Meredith 's life , " it fulfills that function in a very large degree . And Meredith 's reticence , though it has robbed curiosity of many palatable particulars , has been by no means sufficiently stoical to cloak those larger effects of the chief happenings in his life which are most vital for the study of his personality . One discerns , for instance , that his unfortunate first marriage was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the composition of " Modern Love " but for the whole course of his thought and art . One notes , in fairly numerous passages , the significant combination in his attitude towards nature of healthy animalism with intellectual interest ; and the lack of what have been generally considered the deepest emotions in regard to her . On the other hand , one finds in his letters to his oldest son an unexpected revelstion of tenderness , ? the Spartan cloak falls quite away , perhaps primarily because the boy was saved to him from the wreck of the first marriage . One watches the recuperation of his emotional , and the revivifying of his artistic , powers when , several years after his first wife 's death , he meets the woman who is to be his secand wife . And one perceives that " A Reading of Earth , " composed after her death , records the effects not merely of this event but of their whole life together . With the mood of this poem-cycle strong upon him , Meredith writes on March 16 , 1888 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of value , the best of him must be in it . I have written always with the perception that there is no life but of the spirit ; that the concrete is really the shadowy ; yet that the way to spiritual life lies in the complete unfolding of the creature , not in the nipping of his passions . An outrage to Nature helps to extinguish his light . To the flourishing of the spirit , then , through the healthy exercise of the senses . " In this definitive statement of his position , one notes the strangely Carlylean opening and then the almost comic descent toward the Mere dithian close . If some future student of our author 's works should run across this passage ? let us say , in the coming " age of concentration " when the outlines of the concept " spirit " shall have become fairly distinct again ? he would no doubt rub his eyes . He would then perhaps review his net impression of Meredith 's poems and novels with the aim of discovering in it " the perception that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the concrete is really the shadowy . " One 's net impression of Meredith 's works , and now of his letters also , has in the centre of it , not spirit , but " Tuck " ? a composite , social figure sym bolic of things much larger than itself . At least , when the present reviewer had laid aside the two volumes of the Letters , he found that the follow ing final sentences of an early note to Hardman remained most vivid in his mind : " I want restoration . Tuck being absent , I go to Nature , in her sublimest . Your loving , George Meredith . "  |
