txt Peace Problems . To the Editor of The New York Times : I have just received the following letter from a distinguished London banker : - " The whole town went mad from Monday till Saturday . Millions seemed to tie in the streets , and how people could cheer for six days and have any noise left I do not understand . Many people thought that the end would come suddenly , and such a crack up no one expected . The real fact is , I think , that the enemy would not fight any more , to give their lives to delay a result which they saw inevitable . On this side we never had any doubt whatever as to the final outcome of it all , and always held our heads high . " The future is certainly obscure . How all these debts are to be paid and the dislocated business relations restored is a deep Problem . I feel sure that the debt of Germany must be enormously larger than any figure yet admitted . The loos of man power means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will all have to be spread over a long period . We all recognize the value of the United States ' intervention in reducing the length of the war , and there is no doubt the respect of our two countries for each other has greatly grown . I sincerely trust the excellent relations thus established may go on increasing in cordiality . " AMERICAN BANKER . New York , Dec. 8 , 1918.
