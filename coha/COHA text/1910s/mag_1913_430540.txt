OUR first day among the Dolphin and Union Straits Eskimos was the day of all my life to which I had looked forward with the most vivid anticipations , and to which I now look back with equally vivid memories , for it introduced me , a student of mankind and of primitive men especially , to a people of a bygone age . Mark Twain 's Connecticut Yankee went to sleep in the nineteenth century and woke up in King Arthur 's time among knights who rode in clinking mail to the rescue of fair ladies ; we , without going to sleep at all , had walked out of the twentieth century into the country of the intellectual and cultural contemporaries of a far earlier age than King Arthur 's . These were not such men as Cesar found in Gaul or in Britain ; they were more nearly like the still earlier hunting tribes of Britain and of Gaul living oblivious to the building of the first pyramid in Egypt . Their existence on the same continent with our populous cities was an anachronism of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gathered their food with the weapons of the men of the Stone Age , they thought their simple , primitive thoughts and lived their insecure and tense lives . Their lives were to me the mirrors of the lives of our far ancestors whose bones and crude handiwork we now and then discover in river gravels or in prehistoric caves . Such archeological remains found in various parts of the world , of the men who antedated the knowledge of the smelting of metals , tell a fascinating story to him whose scientific imagination can piece it together and fill in the wide gaps , but far better than such dreaming was my present opportunity . I had nothing to imagine ; I had merely to look and listen ; for here were not remains of the Stone Age , but the Stone Age itself , men and women , very human , entirely friendly , who welcomed us to their homes and bade us stay . The dialect they spoke differed so little from t h e Mackenzie River speech which I had acquired in three years of living in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could make ourselves understood from the first . It can not have happened often in the history of t h e world that the first white man to visit a primitive people was o n e who spoke their language . My opportunities were therefore unusual . Long before the year was over I  | was destined to become as one of them , and even from the first hour we were able to converse sympathetically on subjects of common concern . Nothing that I have to tell from the arctic is of greater intrinsic interest or more likely to be considered a contribution to knowledge than the story of our first day with these people who had not , either they or their ancestors , seen a white man until they saw me . I shall therefore tell that story . Like our distant ancestors , no doubt , these people fear most of all things the evil spirits that are likely to appear to them at any time in any guise , and next to that they fear strangers . Our first meeting had been a bit doubtful and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had felt of us and talked with us , and knew we were but common men . Strangers we were , it is true , but we were only three among forty of them , and were , therefore , not to be feared . Besides , they told us , they knew we could harbor no guile from the freedom and frankness with which we came among them ; for , they said , a man who plots treachery never turns his back to those whom he intends to stab from behind . Before the house which they immediately built for us was quite ready for our occupancy children came running from the village to announce that their mothers had dinner ready . The houses were so small that it was not convenient to invite all three of us into the same one to eat ; besides , it was not etiquette to do so , as we now know . Each of us was , therefore , taken to a different place . My host was the seal-hunter whom we had first approached on the ice . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which to offer me my first meal among them , for his wife had been born farther west on the mainland coast than any one else in their village , and it was even said that her ancestors had not belonged originally to their people , but were immigrants from the westward . She would , therefore , like to ask me questions . It turned out , however , that his wife was not a talkative person , but motherly , kindly , and hospitable , like all her countrywomen . Her first questions were not of the land from which I came , but of my footgear . Were n't my feet just a little damp , and might she not pull my boots off for me and dry them over the lamp ? Would I not put on a pair of her  | husband 's dry socks , and was there no little hole in my mittens or coat that she could mend for me ? She had boiled some seal-meat for me , but she had not boiled any fat , for she did not know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always cut it in small pieces and ate it raw themselves ; but the pot still hung over the lamp , and anything she put into it would be cooked in a moment . When I told her that my tastes quite coincided with theirs ? as , in fact , they did ? she was delighted . People were much alike , then , after all , though they came from a great distance . She would , accordingly , treat me exactly as if I were one of their own people come to visit them from afar ? and , in fact , I was one of their own people , for she had heard that the wicked Indians to the south spoke a language no man could understand , and I spoke with but a slight flavor of strangeness . When we had entered the house the boiled pieces of seal - meat had already been taken out of the pot and lay steaming on a sideboard . On being assured that my tastes in food were not likely to differ from theirs , my hostess picked out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , squeezed it firmly between her hands to make sure nothing should later drip from it , and handed it to me , along with her own copper-bladed knife ; the next most desirable piece was similarly squeezed and handed to her husband , and others in turn to the rest of the family . When this had been done , one extra piece was set aside in case I should want a second helping , and the rest of the boiled meat was divided into four portions , with the explanation to me that there were four families in the village who had no fresh seal-meat . The little adopted daughter of the house . a girl of seven or eight , had not begun to eat with the rest of us , for it was her task to take a small wooden platter and carry the four pieces of boiled meat to the four families who had none of their own to cook . I thought to myself that the pieces sent out were a good deal smaller than the individual portions we were eating , and that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I learned later that night from my two companions that four similar presents had been sent out from each of the houses where they were eating , and I know now that every house in the village in which any cooking was done had likewise sent four portions , so that the aggregate must have been a good deal more than the recipients could eat at one time . During our meal presents of food  |  were also brought us from other houses ; each housewife apparently knew exactly what the others had put in their pots , and whoever had anything to offer that was a little bit different would send some of that to the others , so that every minute or two a small girl messenger appeared in our door with a platter of something to contribute to our meal . Some of the gifts were especially designated as for me ? mother had said that , however they divided the rest of what she was sending , the boiled kidney was for me ; or mother had sent this small piece of boiled seal-flipper to me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their house tomorrow I should have a whole flipper , for one of my companions w a s over at their house now , and had told them that I considered the flipper the best part of a seal . As we ate we sat on the front edge of the bedplatform , holding each his piece of meat in the left hand and the knife in the right . This was my first experience with a knife of native copper ; I found it more than sharp enough and very serviceable . The piece of copper ( float ) from which the blade had been hammered out had been found , they told me , on Victoria Island to the north , in the territory of another tribe , from whom they had bought it for some good driftwood from the mainland coast . My hostess sat on my right in front of the cookinglamp , her husband on my left . As the house was only the ordinary oval . snow dome , about seven by nine feet in inside dimensions , there was only free room for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snow platform , over which reindeer , bear , and muskox skins had been spread to make the bed . The children , therefore , ate standing up on the small , open floor space to the right of the door as one enters ; the lamp and cooking-gear and frames for drying clothing over the lamp took up all the space to the left of the door . In the horseshoeshaped , three-foothigh doorway stood the three dogs of my host , side by side , waiting for some one to finish the picking of a bone . As each of us in turn finished a bone we would toss it to one of the dogs , who retired with it to the alleyway , and returned to his position in line again as soon as he had finished it . When the meal was over they all went away unbidden , to curl up and sleep in the alleyway or out-of-doors . Our meal was of two courses : the first , meat ; the second , soup . The soup is made by pouring cold seal blood into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken out of the pot , and stirring briskly until the whole comes nearly ( but never quite ) to a boil . This makes a soup of a thickness comparable to our English pea-soups , but if the pot be allowed to come to a boil , the blood will coagulate and settle to the bottom . When the pot lacks a few degrees of boiling , the lamp above which it is swung is extinguished and a few hand- fuls of snow are stirred into the soup to bring it to a temperature at which it can be freely drunk . By means of a small dipper the housewife then fills the large musk-ox-horn drinking-cups and assigns one to each person ; if the number of cups is short , two or more persons may share the contents of one cup , or a cup may be refilled when one is through with it and passed to another . After I had eaten my fill of fresh seal - meat and drunk two pint cupfuls of blood soup , my host and I moved farther back on the bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against bundles of soft caribouskins , while we talked of various things . He and his wife asked but few questions , and only such as could not be considered intrusive , either according to their standards as I learned them later or according to ours . They understood perfectly , they said , why we had left behind the woman of our party when we came upon their trail , for it is always safest to assume that strangers are going to prove hostile ; but now that we knew them to be harmless and friendly , would we not allow them to send a sled in the morning to bring her to the village ? They had often heard that their ancestors used to come in contact with people to the west , and now it was their good fortune to have with them some men from the west , and they would like to see a western woman , too . It must be a very long way to the land from which we came ; were we not satiated with traveling , and did we not think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tribes who lived farther east would also be glad to see us , and would treat us well , unless we went too far to the east and fell in with the Netsilik Eskimos ( King William Island ) , who are wicked , treacherous people who ? strange to say have no chins . Beyond them , they had heard , lived the white men ( Kablunat ) , of whom , no doubt , we h a d never heard , seeing we came from the west , and the white men a r e farthest of all people to the east . They are said to have various physical deformities ; they had heard that some of them had one eye in the middle of the forehead , but of this they were not sure , because stories that come from afar are always doubtful . The white men were said to be of a strangely eccentric disposition ; when they gave anything to an Eskimo they would take no pay for it , and they would not eat good , ordinary food , but subsisted on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forcing himself to swallow except in case of starvation . And this in spite of the fact that the white men could have better things to eat if they wanted to , for seals , whales , fish , and even caribou abound in their country . These and a great many other things I was told with friendly readiness ; I had only to give them a hint as to what interested me , and they put all their information on that subject at my disposal ; but on their own part they showed the greatest delicacy in asking questions . Were  | they not interested , I asked them , to know why I had come and where I was going ? Yes , they were interested , but they knew that if I wanted them to know I would tell . Asking many questions of strangers was not their custom , but they considered that I asked many because that was no doubt the manner of my people ; it was to he expected that men coming from so great a distance would have customs different from theirs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer my questions , and I would have to stay many days before they got tired of doing whatever they could to s h o w they were glad I had come . After the meal was finished we s a t and talked perhaps an hour , until a messenger came ( it was always the children who carried messages ) to say that my companions had gone to the house that had been built for us , and that the people hoped I would come there , too , for it was a big house , and many could sit in there at once and talk with us . On arriving home I found that , although over half the village were already there , still we had plenty of room within-doors for the four or five who had come along with me to see me home . The floor of the inner half of the house had been raised into the usual two-foot-high snow sleeping-platform , covered with skins , partly ours and partly others ' contributed by various households for our comfort ; a seal-oil lamp for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cozy place , heated by the lamp to a temperature of 60 ? Fahr. in spite of the fact that it was well ventilated by a door that was never closed day or night , and a hole in the roof that was also always open . On the bed platform there was room for twelve or fifteen persons to sit Turkish fashion , and on the floor in front another fifteen could easily stand . Although t h e house was full of guests at my home - coining , they merely stayed a few minutes , for some one suggested that we were no doubt tired and sleepy and would like to be left alone . In the morning , they said , we should have plenty of time for talking . When they were all gone , however , we did not go to sleep , but sat up fully half t h e night discussing the strange things we had seen . My Eskimos were considerably more excited over it all than I. It was , they said , as if we were living through a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the sun is away in winter . What kindly , inoffensive-looking people these were , but no doubt they were powerful and dangerous magicians such as the stories tell about and such as my companions ' fathers had known in their youth . My Mackenzie man , Tannaumirk , had , in fact , heard something to make this clear , for he had eaten supper in the house of a man who last winter had dropped his knife into a seal-hole through the ice where the sea was very deep , but so powerful was the spell he pronounced that when he reached into the water afterward the water came only to his elbow and he picked the knife off the ocean bottom .  | And this , Tannaumirk commented , in spite of the fact that the ice alone was at least a fathom thick and the water so deep that a stone dropped into it would no doubt take a long time to sink to the bottom . Did they believe all this ? I asked my men , though I knew what answer I would get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Had they not often told me that their own people were able to do such things until a few years ago , when they abjured their familiar spirits on learning from the missionary of the existence of heaven and hell , and of the fact that no one can attain salvation who employs spirits to do his bidding ? It was too bad that salvation and the practice of magic were incompatible ; not that such trivial things as the recovery of lost articles were of moment , but in the cure of sickness and the control of weather and ice conditions , prayers seemed so much less efficient than the old charms . Still , of course , they did not really regret the loss of the old knowledge and power , for did they not have the inestimable prospect of salvation which had been denied their forefathers through the unfortunate lateness of the coming of the missionaries ? It was mere shortsightedness to regret having renounced the miraculous ability to cure disease , for God knows best when one should die , and to him who prays faithfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entrance to a happier life . We did not know , the next morning , when we woke up and began to stir about within-doors , that some one had been for a long time listening outside our snowhouse , waiting for signs of our being awake . From familiarity with their customs I now know that it was a signal from him that brought us our earliest visitors of the morning , the hunter whom we had first encountered the previous evening . He came from the village , walking slowly a n d singing at the top of his voice so that we might have ample warning of his approach . When he came to the outer door of our twenty-foot alleyway he stopped and announced himself : " I am So-and-so ; my intentions are friendly ; I have no knife . May I come in ? " This was the invariable formula in our case ; among themselves they would merely announce as they were about to enter a house : " I am So-and-so ; I am coming in . " The talk that morning turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ east and to the north ? Had  | they ever come in contact with the Indians to the south ? Had they any knowledge of white men visiting their country ( for I considered it possible , though not likely , that some survivors of Franklin 's luckless ships , wrecked more than half a century ago near the east coast of Victoria Island , might have lived for a time among these people ) . Although they were doubtless as curious concerning us as I was about them , still they asked few questions , even after I had given them an opening by asking many questions of them . Their admirable reticence and good breeding made me feel more nearly ashamed of my calling than I had ever been before , for an ethnologist must make inquiries , and impertinent ones at times ; but they answered with greatest good humor . They had never seen white men , although they had heard about them the things they had told me last night ; the Indians they had never seen , but they had seen traces of them on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they knew by hearsay from the Coppermine River Eskimos that the Indians are treacherous , bloodthirsty people , wicked and great magicians ? no greater magicians , it was said , than the white men , but more prone to use their power for evil purposes . To the east lived various Eskimo tribes ( of whom they named over a dozen ) , all of whom were friendly . To the north , on Victoria Island , lived two tribes , their nearest neighbors and best friends . And what did they think of me ? to what people did they suppose I belonged ? Oh , but they did not have to guess ; they knew ; for Tannaumirk had told them he belonged to the Kupagmiut , of whom they had heard many stories from their fathers , and my accent made it plain I belonged to the Kupagmiut also , and not to that more distant people to whom my other companion , Natkusiak , belonged , whose language was more strange than ours , and of whom they had never heard the name till told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange my eyes ( which are blue ) , and my beard ( which was light brown ) , and suppose that for that reason I belonged to a different people ? Their answer was decisive : " We have no reason to think you belong to a different people . Your speech differs only a little more from ours than does that of some tribes with whom we trade every year ; and as for your eyes and beard , they are much like those of some of our neighbors to the north , whom you must visit . They are our best friends , and they will never cease being sorry if you pass on to the east without seeing them . " So it was arranged that on the morrow we should pay a visit to the  | people of Victoria Island , who were described to me in a way to make me think that likely I had found the descendants of some of the lost men of the Franklin expedition . We know now that the facts call for another interpretation . One of the things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stronglooking bows and long copper-tipped arrows that we found in the possession of every man of the tribe . I therefore said that I would like to have them illustrate to me the manner in which they killed caribou , and I would in turn show them the weapons and method used by us . Half a dozen of the men at once sent home for their bows , and a block of snow to serve as a target was set up in front of our house . The range at which a target a foot square could be hit with fair regularity turned out to be about thirty or thirty-five yards , and the extreme range of the bow was a bit over one hundred yards , while the range at which caribou are ordinarily shot was shown to be about seventy - five yards . When the exhibition was over I set up a stick at about two hundred yards and fired at it . The peoples men , women . and children ? who stood around had no idea as to the character of the thing I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loud report of my gun all the women and children made a scramble for the houses , while the men ran back about fifteen or twenty yards and stood talking together excitedly behind a snow wall . I at once went to them and asked them to come with me to the stick and see what had happened to it . After some persuasion three of them complied , but unfortunately for me it turned out that I had failed to score . At this they seemed much relieved , but when I told them I would try again they protested earnestly , saying that so loud a noise would scare all the seals away from their hunting - grounds , and the people would therefore starve . It seemed to me imperative , however , to show them I could keep my word and perforate the stick at two hundred yards , and in spite of their protests I got ready to shoot again , telling them that we used these weapons in the west for seal-hunting , and that the noise was found not to scare seals away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole the mark of the bullet on the stick impressed them far less than the noise . In fact , they did not seem to marvel at it at all . When I explained to them that I could kill a polar bear or a caribou at even twice the distance the stick had been from me they exhibited no surprise , but asked me if I could with my rifle kill a caribou on the other side of a mountain . When I said that I could not ,  | they told me that a great shaman in a neighboring tribe had a magic arrow by which he could kill caribou on the other side of no matter how big a mountain . In other words , much to my surprise , they considered the performance of my rifle nothing wonderful . I understand the point of view better now than I did then . It is simply this : if you were to show an Eskimo a bow that would in the ordinary way shoot fifty yards farther than any bow he ever saw , the man would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bow as long as he lived ; he would understand exactly the principle on which it works , would judge it by the standards of the natural , and would find it to excel marvelously . But show him the work of the rifle , which he does not in the least understand , and he is face to face with a miracle ; he judges it by the standards of the supernatural instead of by the standards of the natural ; he compares it with other miraculous things of which he has heard and which he may even think he has himself seen , and he finds it not at all beyond the average of miracles ; for the wonders of our science and the wildest tales of our own mythologies pale beside the marvels which the Eskimos suppose to be happening all around them every day at the behest of their magicians . Perhaps I might here digress from the chronological order of my story to point out that the Eskimos ' refusal to be astonished by the killing at a great distance of caribou or a bear by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not an isolated case . When I showed them later my binoculars that made far - away things seem near and clear , they were of course interested ; when I looked to the south or east and saw bands of caribou that were to them invisible they applauded , and then followed the suggestion : " Now that you have looked for the caribou that are here to-day and found them , will you not also look for the caribou that are coming tomorrow , so that we can tell where to lie in ambush for them ? " When they heard that my glasses could not see into the future they were disappointed and naturally the reverse of well impressed with our powers , for they knew that their own medicine-men had charms and magic paraphernalia that enabled them to see things the morrow u-as to bring forth . At another time , in describing to them the skill of our surgeons , I told that they could put a man to sleep and while he slept take out a section of his intestines or one of his kidneys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even know what had been done to him , except as he was told and as he could see the sewed-up opening through which the part had been removed . Our doctors could even transplant the organs of one man into the body of another . These things I had actually never seen done , but that they were done was a matter of common knowledge in my country . It was similar in their country , one of my listeners told me . He himself had a friend who suffered continually from backache until a  | great medicine-man undertook to treat him . The next night , while the patient slept , the medicine-man removed the entire spinal column , which had become diseased , and replaced it with a complete new set of vertebrme , and ? what was most wonderful ? there was not a scratch on the patient 's skin or anything to show that the exchange had been made . This thing the narrator had not seen done , but the truth of it was a matter of common knowledge among his people . Another man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ d sound one . In other words , the Eskimo believed as thoroughly as I in the truth of what he told ; neither of us had seen the things actually done , but t h a t they were done was a matter of common belief among our respective countrymen ; and the things he told of his medicine-men were more marvelous than the things I could tell of mine . In fact , I had to admit that the transplanting of spinal columns and hearts was beyond the skill of my countrymen ; and as they had the good breeding not to openly doubt any of my stories , it would have been ill-mannered of me to question theirs . Besides , questioning them would have done no good ; I could not have changed by an iota their rockfounded faith in their medicine-men and spirit-compelling charms . In spite of any arguments I could have put forth , the net result of our exchange of stories would have been just what it was , anyway ? that they considered they had learned from my own lips that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theirs . It was near noon of our first day when some one asked me if there were not some way in which the western people celebrated the coming of visitors . I replied that usually all the village gathered in a great dance . That was just their way , my hosts told me , and , seeing that o u r customs coincided , they would make to - day a dancehouse as large as if two large tribes had met to trade ; we should see how they danced , and possibly we might dance for them , too . The idea w a s no sooner broached than a dozen young men ran off to their various houses to don their housebuilding coats and mittens and get their snow-knives , By mid-afternoon the dance - house was up , a snow dome nine feel high , and large enough to accommodate forty people standing in a circle around a fivefoot open space in the center reserved for the dancers . The conditions of life had for many years been hard in the tribe , I was told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had many drum ( the only musical instrument of the Eskimos ) , they themselves had of late years danced but seldom , and there was only one drum left among them . It was a sunshiny , warm day , and while the men were building the dance-house some one fetched the drum , and a young woman sang for us to its accompaniment . She handled it like a tambourine , and played  | it in a manner entirely different from that of the western Eskimos . The songs were different , too , and they sang them charmingly . One song had a rhythm resembling that of the ancient Norse scaldic poems . The girl who sang it was herself very fair for an Eskimo , and had the long , slim fingers I have seen only among half-bloods in Alaska . It was here I got the first definite suggestion that the blond traits which were observable in this tribe ( though not to such a degree as among other tribes later visited ) might have some direct connection with the lost Scandinavian colonists of Greenland . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was built , continued the rest of the . afternoon . None of the dances were identical with any known to my companions from Alaska or the Mackenzie , but there was a general similarity . The performers differed in some cases markedly among themselves ; those especially whose ancestors were said to have come from the mainland coast to the west differed strongly from the rest . Many of the dances were performed without moving the feet at all , but by swaying the body and gesticulating with the arms . In some cases the performer sang , recited , or uttered a series of exclamations , in others he was silent ; but all the dances were done to the accompaniment of the singing of all those present , who knew the song appropriate to each dance . Some dances known to individuals could not be shown because no one was found who could sing the accompaniment . At this time of year ( the middle of May ) there was no darkness at midnight , for summer was approaching . Nevertheless , the people took three meals a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight o'clock in the evening , when the women announced supper . After supper I sat awhile and talked with my host and hostess and one or two visitors , and then all of them walked home with me to our house , where about half the village was gathered as on the evening before . They stayed only a short while , and by eleven o'clock the last visitor had wished us a friendly good night and our first day among the Victoria Land Eskimos had come to an end .  |
