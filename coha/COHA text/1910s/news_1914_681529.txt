txt Mr. CARNEGIE is an apostle of peace , but he believes with Polonius that , being in a quarrel , there should be no nonsense about it . Bear it that the  --  opposed may beware of thee . Lick the other fellow not merely until he is fain to quit , but until he is well resolved never to begin again . It is of extraordinary significance , as a proof of how men 's minds are working , that Mr. CARNEGIE , one of the world 's most notable and conspicuous men of peace , should apply this precept to the present war between the nations of Europe . In . the Magazine Section of THE SUNDAY TIMES there was published the report of a conversation with him in which he spoke of war and peace , how the one might be prevented , the other assured . In this notable interview , characteristic of the man and his well-known principles , and a most important contribution to the discussion of the issues of the European war , Mr. CARNEGIE spoke of the European Federation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Dr. BUTLER , saying that " nothing else could occur which would " he of such immense advantage to " Europe . " And then , some mention being made of an armistice , he continued : If I- were in the place of that great General , Lord KrrcHtsze , and should receive the news that such a request had been made by the commander of the opposing forces , I should say : " No armistice ! Surrender ! " But . then , if the surrender should be made . I should say , in effect : " Gentlemen , we have made up our minds that these terrible explosions must mark the end of war between our civilized nations . Our sacrifices in this war have been too great to permit us to be satisfied with less than this . " If we now can not feel assured of such a federation of nations as will result in the settlement of all future disputes by peaceful arbitration at The Hague , then we shall keep on fighting till the day comes when we can achieve that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That would be a day very different from that to which the men of the German military caste have so often raised their glasses . The day of wrath , the day of defeat for Germany , is what Mr. CARNEGIE means . And that is the thought that is in the mind of every man of sense and foresight , save only those who still cling to the hope that German arms may triumph . It is not that the German people must be crushed , the world has need of them . But the Prussian militarism that has made Germany an evil example and a terror to the nations must be crushed and stamped out once for all , as the Allies of a century ago crushed and stamped out that other scourge of Europe , NAPOLEON . As an indispensable preliminary , Germany must be defeated . When a man . like ANDREW CARNEGIE , fervent advocate of peace that he is , declares that the Allies must " keep on fighting till the day comes when we can achieve that end , " what , the German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolve of the British , the French , and the Russians now in the field against us ? There can be no assured peace in Europe until the military aristocracy of Prussia , of which the Kaiser is either the chief or , as Mr. CARNEGIE believes , the helpless instrument , is destroyed . They are the plague and pest of Germany . There can be no halfway measure with them , and an inconclusive peace could only bring a halfway cure , . which would be no cure at all , only a palliative and a postponement . Our interest is akin to that of Europe . The assurance of permanent peace is. the heart 's desire of the nations opposed to Germany ; without that assurance we on this side the ocean can have no tranquillity , no security . We know too well the spirit and the ambition of Germany . Our turn would come . In that bloody game we want no turn , no part . For that abundantly good reason the American people are of one mind with Mr. CAnsEete  --  the fighting must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assured . While their military chiefs are still battling vainly in their madness and their blindness the German people ought to see and acclaim the dawning of that day .
