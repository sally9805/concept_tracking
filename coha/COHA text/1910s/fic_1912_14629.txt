The scene shows a luxuriously furnished room . In the centre is a table with a lamp . To the right is the entrance into the front hall , the front door of the house being visible . In the corner is a cabinet of curios . In the rear is a large window opening on the street . Open fire-place . There are two entrances at the left . There are book-shelves , several easy-chairs , etc. , in the room . At rise : The stage is empty , and the room is darkened except for the fire in the grate . Sounds of breaking wood are heard at the window . JIM FARADAY A roughly-dressed young fellow with a patch over one eye , enters through window , stands gazing about nervously , looks into the hall , etc. , then flashes a dark lantern . This looks pretty good . Goes to mantel , takes silver cup and puts it into bag which he carries ; then exit left . HARVEY AUSTIN Enters at front door without much noise . Hangs up coat and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a smooth-faced young man in evening dress . All gone to bed , hey ? Takes out cigarette case and is about to light one , when a crash is heard off left , as of a vase falling . He starts , then runs to table , opens drawer , takes out revolver , and examines it , and steals off through the other entrance at left , saying , " That noise seemed to come from downstairs . " p. 3 JIM FARADAY Enters panic-stricken . God ! What a thing to do ! Gazes into hall and upstairs  --  long pause . Do n't seem to have waked them . Proceeds to examine room , stopping now and then to listen . After placing several articles in bag , he goes to cabinet and tries to open it . This takes some time , and while he is crouching in the shadow , with his back to the entrance right , MRS . AUSTIN appears . HELEN AUSTIN She is young and beautiful , and wears a night-robe and dressing-gown . She stands looking about anxiously , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sound from JIM , and starts wildly . Oh ! JIM FARADAY Leaps to feet , lifting revolver . Hold up your hands ! She starts back in terror . Hold up your hands ! HELEN AUSTIN Half complyingly . I 'm not armed . JIM FARADAY Never mind . Long pause while they stare at each other . I do n't want to hurt you , lady . HELEN AUSTIN Calmly , after first shock . No , I suppose not . You only want to get away . JIM FARADAY That 's right ! p. 4 HELEN AUSTIN Very well , you may go . JIM FARADAY And you yell for the police the moment I get out of the door , hey ? HELEN AUSTIN No , I do n't want the police . I do n't believe in sending men to jail . JIM FARADAY Humph ! Another pause . HELEN AUSTIN Why do you do this ? JIM FARADAY It 's the way I live . HELEN AUSTIN Is n't it a rather trying kind of work ? JIM FARADAY It ai n't all play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be hard on the nerves . After another pause . Is there no honest way you can earn a living ? JIM FARADAY I do n't know . Maybe so . I got tired of looking for it . HELEN AUSTIN I might help you if you would let me . JIM FARADAY I ai n't asking any help . HELEN AUSTIN No , but I 'm offering it . After a pause . Have you been doing this sort of thing very long ? JIM FARADAY No. p. 5 HELEN AUSTIN How long ? JIM FARADAY After hesitation . This is my first job . HELEN AUSTIN What ! You do n't mean that ? JIM FARADAY It happens to be true , ma'am . HELEN AUSTIN What made you do it ? JIM FARADAY It 's a long story . HELEN AUSTIN Tell it to me . JIM FARADAY It ai n't just a good time for story telling . HELEN AUSTIN You are afraid of me ? I have no quarrel with you . I do n't care anything for the things you have in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't take them now . I 'm only sorry to see a man going wrong , and I 'd like to help if I could . I 'll play fair , I give you my word of honor . JIM FARADAY There ai n't much honor in this business . HELEN AUSTIN No , I suppose not . But you can trust me . Put up that gun and talk to me . JIM FARADAY Surlily . It ca n't do any good . HELEN AUSTIN It ca n't do any harm . Put up that revolver , and tell me what 's the matter . JIM FARADAY You 'll let me go when I want to ? No tricks ! p. 6 HELEN AUSTIN I give you my word . JIM FARADAY All right . I 'm a fool , I guess , but I 'll trust you . Puts revolver in pocket . Sit down , ma'am . It must be cold for you . This is a queer kind of layout for a burglar . Sits opposite her . You heard that racket I made in the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JIM FARADAY Some kind of a jar . HELEN AUSTIN Oh , my Greek vase . Well , never mind it was an imitation . What were you doing ? JIM FARADAY I was looking for something to eat . HELEN AUSTIN Oh ! JIM FARADAY It would have been the first thing I 've had since the day before yesterday . HELEN AUSTIN What 's the matter ? JIM FARADAY No work . A pause . I suppose you 'll give me the old gag there 's plenty of work for a man that 's willing . HELEN AUSTIN No , I happen to have studied , and I know better than that . Else I should have fainted when I saw you instead of sitting here talking to you Do you drink ? p. 7 JIM FARADAY Yes , but I did n't use to . Any man would drink that went through what I did . HELEN AUSTIN Are you married ? JIM FARADAY Yes I was married . My wife is dead . HELEN AUSTIN Any children ? JIM FARADAY Two . Both dead . HELEN AUSTIN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ma'am . It 's a poor man 's story . HELEN AUSTIN Tell it to me . JIM FARADAY All right . It 'll spoil your sleep for the rest of the night , I guess , but you can have it . A pause . A year ago I was what they call an honest working man . I had a home and a happy family ; and I did n't drink any too much , and I did well even if the work was hard . I was in the steel works here in town . HELEN AUSTIN Startled . The Empire Steel Company ? JIM FARADAY Yes . Why ? HELEN AUSTIN Nothing only I happen to know some people there . Go on . JIM FARADAY It 's no child 's work there , ma'am . There 's an awful lot of accidents more than the world has any idea of . I 've seen a man sent to hell in the snapping of a finger . And they do n't treat them fair they hush things up . There are things you would n't believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AUSTIN Tell them . JIM FARADAY I 've seen a man there get caught in one of the cranes . They stopped the machinery , but they could n't get him out . They 'd have had to take the crane apart , and that would have cost several days , and it was rush time , and the man was only a poor Hunkie , and there was no one to know or care . So they started up the crane , and cut his leg off . HELEN AUSTIN Oh , horrible ! JIM FARADAY It 's the sort of thing you could n't believe unless you saw it . But I saw it . I did n't care , though . I was a fool . And then my time came . HELEN AUSTIN How do you mean ? JIM FARADAY A blast furnace blew out , and a piece of slag hit me here , where you see that patch . If it was n't for the patch you 'd see something that would make you sick . It was a pain you could n't tell about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was . And the first thing when I came to my senses in the hospital , it was there was a lawyer chap with a paper waiting for me . HELEN AUSTIN In agitation . A lawyer ? JIM FARADAY Yes , ma'am . Company representative , you know . And I was to sign the paper it was a receipt for the hospital expenses the operation and all that you see they had to take out what was left of my eye . And of course I could n't see I had to sign where he told me to . And when I got well , I found they had trapped me into signing a release . p. 9 HELEN AUSTIN A release ? JIM FARADAY I had accepted the hospital expenses as a release for all the company owed me . And I could n't get any damages and my eye was gone , and all the weeks without any wages . HELEN AUSTIN My God ! JIM FARADAY And they turned me out so weak I could hardly walk ; and HELEN AUSTIN Greatly excited . Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This lawyer ? JIM FARADAY I never heard his name . He was a young fellow handsome smooth-faced HELEN AUSTIN Whispering . Oh ! JIM FARADAY Ah , they do n't mind it they 're smooth . They do that all the time . It 's what they get their pay for . HELEN AUSTIN Covering her face with her hands . Oh , stop ! JIM FARADAY What 's the matter ? HELEN AUSTIN Looking up with white face . Nothing . Go on . JIM FARADAY It was two months before I could work at all . And the rent came due , and they turned us out it was winter-time , and my wife caught a cold , and it turned to pneumonia , and she died . That 's all of that . p. 10 HELEN AUSTIN Go on . JIM FARADAY And then , you see , the panic came and the mills shut down sudden as that . The lawyer told me the company would see I always had a job , but that was only to get me to sign . HELEN AUSTIN Feverishly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the office and tried ; but they would n't even let me see him . HELEN AUSTIN I see . And then ? JIM FARADAY Then I went out to look for work . I had the two babies , you know and God only knows how I loved those babies . I said I 'd fight and win out for their sakes . But Amy she was the little one she never had been very strong . When you 're a poor man , you ca n't get the best food , even if you know what it is . It ai n't fit milk they sell for the children in this city ; and the baby died I never knew what was the matter exactly . And there was only one left and me tramping the streets all day looking for a job . How was I to take care of him , lady ? How could I have helped it ? His voice is breaking with emotion . And oh , ma'am , he was the loveliest little fellow with hair like gold . And so well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ? p. 11 JIM FARADAY A street car killed him . HELEN AUSTIN Oh ! JIM FARADAY Run over his chest , ma'am . I came home at night , and they told me , and I near went out of my mind . Can you think what it was to see him with his eyes starting out of his head like , and his beautiful little body all mashed flat HELEN AUSTIN Wildly . Oh , spare me ! JIM FARADAY I told you it would n't be a pretty story . Do you think maybe you would n't take to drink if you saw a sight like that ? Sinking back . Since then I 've looked for work , but I have n't cared much . Only sometimes I 've thought I 'd like to meet that young lawyer HELEN AUSTIN Starting up . Oh ! JIM FARADAY Yes , it all began with him . But I do n't know they 'd only jug me . Anyway , tonight I was sitting in a saloon with two fellows that I had met . One of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fire-escapes . And I heard him telling about a haul he 'd made , and I said to myself : " There 's a job for me I 'll be a second-story man . " And I tried it but you see I did n't do very well . I 'm not good for much , I guess , any more . p. 12 HARVEY AUSTIN Enters left , revolver in hand ; stands watching , unobserved . Good heavens ! HELEN AUSTIN You ca n't tell . You may have better success than you look for . JIM FARADAY No there 's nothing can help me . I 'm for the scrap heap . HELEN AUSTIN Eagerly . Wait and see . You are a man you can be helped yet HARVEY AUSTIN Coming forward . What does this mean ? JIM FARADAY Starts wildly and reaches for revolver . Ha ! HARVEY AUSTIN Raising weapon . Holdup your hands ! HELEN AUSTIN Rushing forward . No . Stop ! HARVEY AUSTIN What do you mean ? HELEN AUSTIN I say stop ! I promised him his freedom ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . HARVEY AUSTIN Why HELEN AUSTIN Give it to me . Takes revolver . Now sit down . p. 13 JIM FARADAY Has been staring wildly at AUSTIN . My God , it 's the lawyer fellow ! HELEN AUSTIN Yes , it is he . HARVEY AUSTIN What does all this mean ? HELEN AUSTIN Look at this man ! HARVEY AUSTIN Staring . Why ? HELEN AUSTIN Do n't you know him ? HARVEY AUSTIN No . HELEN AUSTIN Look carefully . Turns up light . Have you never seen him before ? HARVEY AUSTIN Never that I can recall . What is his name ? HELEN AUSTIN I do n't know . To JIM . What is it ? JIM FARADAY Humph ! Hesitating . He could find out , anyway . Jim Faraday . HARVEY AUSTIN Faraday it sounds familiar . JIM FARADAY Grimly . You 've served the trick on a good many , I guess . HARVEY AUSTIN To Mrs. AUSTIN . What does he mean ? JIM FARADAY Do n't you remember the Sisters ' Hospital ? The fellow that had his eye burned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Startled . Oh ! JIM FARADAY Sneeringly . Ah , yes ! HARVEY AUSTIN You are the man ? JIM FARADAY I 'm the man . HELEN AUSTIN Harvey , you took this man some paper to sign . HARVEY AUSTIN Yes I remember . HELEN AUSTIN Did you tell him what was in it ? HARVEY AUSTIN Hesitates . Why HELEN AUSTIN Answer me , please . HARVEY AUSTIN Why , my dear HELEN AUSTIN Did you tell him what was in it ? HARVEY AUSTIN But , my dear , it was n't my business to tell him . HELEN AUSTIN Oh ! HARVEY AUSTIN I was representing the company . HELEN AUSTIN I see . HARVEY AUSTIN It was his place to see what was in it . HELEN AUSTIN Harvey ! This man with one eye burned out , and not yet over the accident ? p. 15 HARVEY AUSTIN My dear , you do n't understand JIM FARADAY Wildly . You did n't leave me to find out for myself . You lied to me ! HELEN AUSTIN At least you permitted him to be misled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the paper , and what would be the effect if he signed it . HARVEY AUSTIN My dear , you do not understand . I could not have done that . I was the representative of the interests of the company . HELEN AUSTIN And that is the sort of work you do for them ? HARVEY AUSTIN That is the sort of work that has to be done . I can not help it , much as I would like to HELEN AUSTIN Wildly . You have done that sort of thing before . And you will do it again ! HARVEY AUSTIN My dear HELEN AUSTIN And you take money for it ! You bring that money home to me ! And you never told me how you got it ! You make me sharer in your guilt ! HARVEY AUSTIN Helen ! HELEN AUSTIN This was how you earned your promotion ! This was what you came to me and boasted about ! This was what we married on . This money blood money that you get for cheating this helpless laborer out of his rights out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AUSTIN My dear , you are out of your mind . You do not understand business . HELEN AUSTIN I understand it all a child could understand ! It is only you the rising young lawyer that does n't understand ! Harvey , Harvey ! Do you know what you have done to this man what you and I together have done to him ? We have wrecked his life ! We have driven him to hell ! We have murdered his wife and his two children . We have turned him into a tramp and a criminal . We have climbed to success on top of him we have made our fortune out of his blood ! This house this furniture these pictures all this beauty and comfort all this we have coined out of his tears and agony out of the lives of his sick wife and his two little babies ! And you have done this for me you have made me the cause of it you have put the guilt of it upon my young life a thing that I must carry through the world with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Helen ! HELEN AUSTIN No ! Do n't touch me ! Speak to HIM ! It is with him you have to do ! What have you to say to him ? Do n't think about me ! HARVEY AUSTIN My dear , be reasonable ! HELEN AUSTIN What have you to say to him ? That is what I want to know ! Harvey ! Do n't you understand it is your character that is up for judgment ? p. 17 HARVEY AUSTIN It ca n't be as bad as you say . HELEN AUSTIN Why ca n't it ? Find out . HARVEY AUSTIN After a long pause , turns to Jim . Faraday . JIM FARADAY Well ? HARVEY AUSTIN Is what my wife says true ? JIM FARADAY It 's true . HARVEY AUSTIN You got no damages from the company ? JIM FARADAY Did n't you fix it yourself ? What do they pay you for ? HARVEY AUSTIN And had you no money saved ? JIM FARADAY My family had to live on it . HARVEY AUSTIN And did n't you get your job back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HARVEY AUSTIN Oh , that 's so . I forgot that . JIM FARADAY Humph ! HARVEY AUSTIN That 's too bad . I will have to do something for you . JIM FARADAY Will that bring my wife and babies back to life ? HARVEY AUSTIN Oh , your family died ! My God that 's terrible ! A pause . Faraday , I ca n't help that . What can I do ? Listen , man you see how unhappy my wife is you do n't want to make the thing impossible for me , do you ? p. 18 JIM FARADAY I ai n't doing anything . HARVEY AUSTIN Be reasonable , and let me atone for the mistake . We 'll say nothing about this about tonight . We 'll start over , and I 'll see that you get a good job , and a fair chance . JIM FARADAY Humph ! HARVEY AUSTIN Will you do that ? I 'm honestly sorry about it . And perhaps if I can give you some money for a start Takes out purse . JIM FARADAY Put up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much there as I 'd have got from the company . HARVEY AUSTIN Oh , is that it ? Well , maybe that is fair . I 'll fix it up with you on that basis . JIM FARADAY And what about the other fellows , hey ? HARVEY AUSTIN The other fellows ? JIM FARADAY That you 've done out the same way you done me . What about Dan Kearney , that lost his life the day after and you and the rest of the company sharks fixed it up so that his widow could n't prove how it was that he got hurt ! HELEN AUSTIN Harvey ! JIM FARADAY Yes , ma'am , they done that . And it ai n't the first time they done it , either nor the last . And they 've bought juries and judges , too , I reckon there ai n't much work of a dirty sort that the Empire Steel Company ai n't tried in this city and you can bet their smart young lawyers know all the game ! I 'm sorry for you , lady you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . But I 've seen too much of the company and its ways , and I wo n't lie down and lick its hand not for any money ! I ai n't so low I 've got the value of my wife and two little babies figured out and ready to hand . I reckon I 'll stay on the outside of the fence and take my chances . I 'll wind up in jail , I suppose ; but there 's many a better man than me done the same . So I guess I 'll go , and we 'll call it off . Starts away. p. 19 HELEN AUSTIN Harvey ! HARVEY AUSTIN My dear HELEN AUSTIN Is that all you can say to him ? You will let him go ? To JIM . Listen to me . You are right . We can never undo what we have done . We can not repay you . But at least we must do what we can . We can not let the evil go on . You yourself have no right to do it you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I see what you mean , lady ; and I 'm sorry for you . I 'd help you if I could . But it 's too late I know that . There ca n't anybody save me . I 'm rotten I 'm a boozer . I could n't stop if I wanted to . And I ai n't got any reason to want to . I ai n't in the running . HELEN AUSTIN Stretching out her arms . But what can I do ? JIM FARADAY You can look after them that ai n't down . Look after them that your husband and the rest of the company 's sharks will do up tomorrow . HELEN AUSTIN No ! JIM FARADAY Oh , they 'll do it ! I know what you mean you 'll make him stop but they 'll have another man in his place . It 's a machine it goes right on . Yes , and you wo n't do as much as you think you will , either you 'll think it over , and you wo n't go as far as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No ! JIM FARADAY Ah , but you ca n't help it you 're in the mill , too . It 's the class you belong to . You can talk and feel sorry but you ai n't made to do things . You have to have your houses and your fine dresses and you could n't live without them , and there 'd be no use your trying . And that means you have to live off my class you have to ride on our backs . And it do n't much matter which part you ride on , as far as I can see . You 'll make your husband get a new job , maybe ; but he 'll do the same thing in another way only you wo n't find it out . But any way he gets his money it 'll come out of me and my kind . D'ye see ? I do the work I 'm the man underneath . I make the good things , and you get them . A pause . Good luck to you . HELEN AUSTIN You are cruel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just told you the facts . I feel sorry for you . I 'd do anything I could for you . Stretching out his hands . See what I 've done ! I 've given you your husband 's life . HELEN AUSTIN Oh ! JIM FARADAY Yes , just that . You 've no idea how many times I swore it that I 'd kill him on sight that I 'd strangle the life out of him , if ever I laid eyes on him again . I used to sit when I was half drunk , and brood over it my God , I even swore it by the body of my little boy ! And I 've got my gun , and you 've taken his away from him . And I do n't shoot him . A pause . I leave him to you . Grimly . You punish him . Exit right . AUSTIN stretches out his arms to his wife . She sinks upon the table , burying her head.                @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
