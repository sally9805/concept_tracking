txt . What would be Gov . FORT 'S position If he should be asked to arbitrate a labor dispute within his jurisdiction ? He would discover that his public utterances had disqualified him to act impartially , through having prejudged the merits of labor 's differences with capital . His case will be useful if it should act as a caution to others in public places not thus to prejudice their usefulness . It is to be regretted , for mother example , that the President of this borough has expressed himself so sympathetically toward the Philadelphia dispute that he could hardly act i'judicially upon the merits of any dif , ferences between labor , and capital in this neighborhood . He is entitled to his personal preferences , for either personal or political reasons , but as an ? official he should be more cautious if he wishes really to serve his clients . Gov . Foal has done more than disqualified himself as a fair-minded official . He has disqualified himself as an economist . For example , he says : In all cases , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will discover that labor has been unfairly and unjustly treated . He reads in the newspapers that the corporation he works for has increased its capital stock $200.000.000 . But he does not hear that his twelve-dollar salary has been increased . As a citizen an employe may have views regarding capitalization , but why should his wages be more when the capital fund is larger , unless they ghould be smaller when it is smaller , and he thus be under obligation to work for nothing , perhaps , if his employer is poor , or perhaps to contribute to his employer 's support if he is bankrupt ? The plain reason is that wages are dependent upon the labor market . and not upon the money market . The capitalist is in relations with both markets , but the wage earner with only one . If he wants more wages he may earn more , if not from one employer then from another . That is his right and duty as an honest worker . To exact more than he is worth because his employer is supposed to berich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why should an employe grudge the enlargement of an undertaking 's capital ? If it is real capital it is entered in the concern 's books as a liability , something which eventually Must be repaid , and meanwhile must be set to work as much as any employe . Dollars can no more be allowed to remain idle than wage earners , and capital can only be employed in setting men to work . Cases have been known in which corporations have borrowed money to disburse as wages , and have been 13ankru  --  ted by doing so . Possibly th-e increase of capital may not be followed by an increase of wages , but it is altogether likely to be followed by the employment of more workers , or by Continuance of employment of workers who otherwise might be discharged . In either case how is labor as a class prejudiced ? Gov . FORT is all for arbitration , the third arbitrator to be named by the Governor . If he named the umpire he could enforce the award , for capital is responsible . How would it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor to be brought into court ? Unions are not employed as such , and could not be . even if they were incorporated . If a judgment of enforced labor were to be given to a Sheriff for execution against an individual , how would the result differ from slavery ? Is the Governor sure that his sympathetic words are really such as his beneficiaries de , sire ? Has he informed himself upon the theories or practice of labor leaders toward arbitration ? The right of free labor Is as jealously regarded by labor spokesmen as the right of free speech . And in this capital agrees with labor , only reserving that rights of any sort should be - adjudicated by the courts . The trouble is that the principals in a struggle , and partisan interveners , think more of rights than duties . Labor organizations altogether deny the right of every man to work for the wages acceptable to him , and they consistently oppose the full enforcement of wage earners ' duty to earn the wages imposed by collective bargaining .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
