txt From the United States Council of national Defense , composed of the ** of War , Navy , Interior , kgriculture , Commerce , and Labor , ! omen a statement in regard to the nigh cost of living that contains the narrow of the whole problem . " The nation 's productive powers have not been fully utilized since the armistice . " Too few goods , especially boo few of the necessaries of life , have been produced . The high cost of living has been caused by " war.waste " ; that is , in large part , the productive energies of the nation and *of other nations have been devoted to producing war material ; and by a great inflation of money and credit . We live by goods , and not money ; and to decrease the- cost of living the primary , ' precedent , and only effectual remedy is to increase production , increase the amount of goods . What the council says about profiteering , the enforcement of existing , and the enactment of new , laws to check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , profiteering and hoarding are incidental . The essential thing is to work , to produce ; to work as hard as we can , and to produce as much as we can . Saving is important . The increase of production , accompanied with rigid economy and saving , was strongly advocated by Mr. WiLsoN in his address to the country on Aug. 25 . " Produce and save , " / says the Federal IteEerve Bulletin for this month . But saving , too , is largely dependent upon increased production . That $25,000,000 lost in wages by strikes in the United States this year , according to the statistics of the Labor Department , is all lost , as is the $100,000,000 worth of goods not produced because of those strikes . It is not by clamoring for higher wages for ( I shorter and less productive day 's work ; it is not by the ' success of that clamor , wherever it is successful , that any real gain is made . On the contrary , that is the way to add to the increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Great Britain there have been tremendous activity and strife about the distribution of the profits of production . Labor seeks fatter dividends . A political economist of the first rank , Dr. KING of the University of Wisconsin , thinks it " im " probable that , with our present na " tional productive power , any fea " Sible system of distribution could j " increase the average wage earner 's " income In purchasing power by " more than one-fourth , and this Is j " an extreme rather than a moderate " estimate " ; and this addition is only theoretically possible , since , to make it , interest , rents , profits . would have to be confiscated , and there would be no fund from which Increases and improvements of industrial Plants could he made , save the doubtful savings from increased wages . " . The grim fact remains , " continues Dr. ' Ktzco , " that the quantity of goods I " turned out absolutely limits the in " come of labor , and that no reform " will bring universal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creasing the national income ? ? ? " Nature refuses to yield her bounty " except in retu ! n for effort expended . " Demands for higher wages have I " never yet unlocked her store " houses . " " Work , produce , co-operate , save . " That is the formula of the Council of ' National Defense . The preliminary , essential , and vital part of the process , to which all the other parts are ancillary , upon which all the other parts depend , is hard work and the production of more goods . American labor , says the Council of Defense , must " attain maximum production , " and maintain an uninterrupted dls " tribution of goods , if labor itself is " net to suffer from further rises in " the cost of living .
