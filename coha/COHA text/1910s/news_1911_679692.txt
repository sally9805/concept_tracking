txt The conclusions reached in the " investigation " made by Richard T. Crane , the Chicago multi-millionaire , relative to the amount of drunkenness and dissipation among college men do not pass unchallenged by men who , unlike Mr. Crane , have spent a part of their lives in colleges . In the college clubs in this city there was considerable discussion yesterday iof Mr. Crane 's charges , which had been stated without " detailed proof " - 1 for instance , that 90 per cent . of the students at Harvard drink in their freshman year and 05 per cent . in their senior year and that 15 per cent . go irretrievably to the bad . A few years ago a few members of the Illinois Legislature asked Mr. Crane 's advice on the question of increasing the appropriation for the University of Illinois . He replied by letter . and advised " that instead of . appropriating more money it would be a good deal better for the State to put a torch to tile buildings and burn them down and turn a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Presidents and professors dismissed his denunciation as a mass of unfounded absurdities . " We 'll continue to furnish college engineers for Mr. Crane 's factories as fast as we can turn them out , " said Dr. Frank W. Gunsalus , head of the Armour Institute of Technology . " The trouble with Mr. Crane , : ' said George E. , President of the University of Iowa , " is that he Judges the successes of life on a dollar basis . " Mr. Crane at one time called Andrew Carnegie 's technical schools of Pittsburgh " a twelve-million-dollar blunder . " At the same time it was said that he gave $200,000 annually for the furthering of manual training schools in Chicago . Dr. Royal S. Copeland , President of the University of Michigan Club and Dean of the New York Homeopathic Medical College and Flower Hospital , took objection to what he called Mr. Crane 's " generali-zations , " " The justice of Mr. Crane 's criticism depends on the source and reliability of his proof , " he said . " Regardless of actual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harm . To be convincing to the general public , and especially to anxsous parents - 6f prospective students , - tile answer to so positive an allegation must come from persons fully qualified to speak authoritatively on the subject . " Not only did I spend many years as a student in one of America 's largest colleges , the University of Michigan , but , after an absence from Ann Arbor of several years , I was called back to a Faculty position , serving in that capacity for thirteen years . During those years more than 10,000 individuals matriculated in the university . For several years I happened to be Mayor of the City of Ann Arbor , and , under the charter of that city , the Mayor is really Police Commissioner and chief conservator of the peace . Since leaving Ann . Arbor I have been executive officer of one of the medical Faculties here . All in all , then , I have had an unusually direct personal and official contact with college students for more than twenty years . " What a young man in college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would do anywhere else , away from his home and immediate family . A college boy is no different from any other boy ; he is simply a boy in college . If he played billiards in his home town , he will play billiards in nis college town ; if he visited saloons at home , he will do so away from home . If he attended church regularly or frequented the Young Men 's Christian Association at home , he will - seek the same sort of companionship at college . " The very nature of college organization makes for the good of the student body . All the new men come at a given time ; they are interviewed by a Faculty committee ; they are ' rushed ' by the fraternity ; they are corralled by the religious organizations , If one escapes to perdition it must be because he willfully prefers to go . " Personally I have known but two students who became notoriously intemperate . One of them was so bad that he was recommended to me by the Chief of Police for expulsion from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his drinting habits . Immediately on their return to their homes and families I am glad to testify , both these men reformed . " I am one of those who believe in the enthusiasm of college athletics , I ' have observed that since Yost gave Michigan a great football record the students no longer to downtown saloons to discuss athletics .
