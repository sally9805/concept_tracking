YOU can kill anything from an elephant to an epidemic with a touch of the little finger if you can only catch it young enough . The most furious pestilence that ever swept across the world started from invisible bacilli , thousands of which literally could have danced on the point of a needle . The courts have a motto , " De minimis non curat lex , " " The law does not concern itself with trifles , " but in medicine the rule could run , " Take care of the trifles and the tragedies will take care of themselves . " For life is made up of trifles , and the puzzle is to know which are the trifling trifles , and which the tragic . As Lewis Carroll explains in his " Hunting of the Snark , " the real difficulty is to know when your snark is a boojum and will bite , especially as all snarks look exactly alike . The first thing to realize in drawing the line between a foolish and morbid apprehensiveness , which does more harm than good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which will save us from many a serious mishap , is that it is not necessary to be anxious about slight variations in what might be termed the staple necessities of life and health , such as food , drink , sleep , work , and fresh air . It really is not going to make any vital difference whether we eat a few ounces more or less of any particular food at a meal , or have not quite enough vegetables one day , or quite enough meat the next , or sleep half an hour less than usual on some particular night , or change from summer to winter underwear a week later or earlier in November . In fact , frequent and constant changes in food , temperature , exercise and rest , climate and scene , are absolutely necessary to keep us in a condition of vigorous and bounding health . An equable climate and an unvarying life are things to be avoided instead of sought after . The " margin of safety , " as engineers call it , is a wide one in the healthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only see to it that you get enough ? and be sure that that enough is " a plenty " ? of the great necessities of life : food , fresh air , sleep , and play , and you need not dread occasional excesses or deprivations . A perpetual anxiety and fussiness about trivial dangers which may menace our precious health , turning molehills into mountains , is about the most unwholesome and unhappy frame of mind that can well be imagined . People who live stuffy , indoor , packed-in-cotton-wool sorts of lives , with mufflers round their throats and shawls over their shoulders and flannel next to their skins , who see seeds of pestilence in every mote that dances in the sunbeams and pneumonia in every puff of raw air , are simply turning themselves into fine feeding-grounds for bacteria , and inviting every wandering " bug " to come and roost on them . There is , however , a group of risks and strains to which the human constitution is exposed in respect to which we do well to exercise a fairly high degree of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and contacts , direct or indirect , with disease and its carriers . Strangely enough , and most fortunately , as our knowledge increases , these two classes of dangers are tending more and more to reduce themselves into one , while the line of protection against them is getting clearer and simpler . Indeed , it might be summed ap for both in one injunction , " Keep out the dirt : " Keep dust and filth with their surgical fever germs out of cuts and scratches ; keep foul air with its influenza , pneumonia . and tubercle bacilli out of the nose ; keep spoiled food and foul water with their typhoid bacilli and dysentery " bugs " out of the stomach . To take or suggest any measures that would cover the wide realms of both feeding and breathing certainly seems , in the language of the day , " a large order . " But here again the problem has rather unexpectedly simplified itself , and it is not too much to say that a policy of strict and rigorous simple cleanliness would save us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nose , throat , and lung troubles as it will in surgical injuries . Particularly is this true of digestive disturbances . Pure , sound , wholesome food , even though injudicious in amount , difficult of digestion , and moderately inappropriate , seldom causes serious digestive trouble save when there is not enough of it , or not a sufficient variety . In other words , colics and acute indigestion depend not so much upon injudicious or indigestible foods as upon dirty or spoiled foodstuffs . For , broadly speaking , all real foods are perfectly good and wholesome when fresh , though they differ widely , of course , in nutritive value and palatability . What is more to the point ? though at first it may be rather difficult to believe ? such foods will remain wholesome as long as they remain clean . They may wilt and fade and shrivel , or become overripe , simply by being kept too long , but they will not " spoil , " in the sense of becoming  | dangerous to eat , unless they become dirty ; that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months , and even years , in cold storage because by the freezing temperature the germs in them are absolutely put to sleep , and prevented from growing and producing poisonous changes . Even zero temperatures , however , will not render harmless poisons that were formed in a food before it was frozen . Much of the bad repute which " coldstorage chicken , " for instance , has acquired is due to the fact that the birds had begun to spoil before they were put into the refrigerator . Absolute cleanliness in the gathering , collecting , shipping , marketing , and handling of foods will produce all the good results of refrigeration without any of its drawbacks . Even so , ideal refrigerating conditions , that is , hermetic sealing with air-tightness , which would keep meats fresh for a long time , are practically impossible . Nor is it really desirable that this should be otherwise , for the fresher all sorts of foods can be eaten the better , and our problem as sanitarians today is to reduce the time between farmer and feeder to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two methods will give the best practical results . Keep as many " bugs " as possible out of your food by insisting on the cleanest of handling by farmers , dairymen , marketmen , shopkeepers , and cooks , and by seeing to it that it is kept constantly cool ? in railway , shop , and kitchen refrigerator and ice-chests ? so that what few bugs do get in will be prevented from growing and spoiling the food . Even so trivial and routine a procedure as washing the hands before eating , which is sometimes resented as a mere superfluity of fastidiousness , particularly by the young , will avert many an attack of indigestion for which the poor harmless food would otherwise have been blamed . The chief way in which typhoid fever , for instance , is spread to nurses or members of the family taking care of a case is by eating with unwashed hands and thus introducing the germs into the stomach , while the terrible results of lead-poisoning and painter 's colic are due almost solely to occasions when the workers eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or from benches or tables in the work-room , or even without removing their working overalls , smeared with paint or covered with lead dust which may easily find its way into their food . The pride of the model housewife in spotless linen , shining silver , and immacu late china , at which the mere crude male is apt to smile in a quizzical and , superior manner , has the soundest of biological bases . Any table-linen that " does n't show the dirt , " and will go for long periods without washing , is an enemy to public health . The more glossily snowy , shining , and spotless everything that enters into table-service can be kept , the more glaringly will shine forth any pos sible accidental contaminations . Any kind of vanity and pride which results in a competition in cleanliness is of genuine hygienic value , however superfluous and finicky it may appear . Suppose , however , that the mischief has been done ; the tainted food has been swallowed , and you arc made aware of the fact by an internal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though scarcely the happiest mode of relief , is for the stomach to reject its unwelcome contents , and at one time , both in professional and domestic medicine , drugs that would produce this reverse . action with neatness and despatch were much relied upon . An emetic , followed by a purge , was likewise in high favor as a remedy , but more careful study has shown that in the great majority of cases ? in fact , in all save those where the food was abso lutely putrid when eaten ? its contained germs do not increase to a sufficient number of millions to cause noticeable trouble until it has passed beyond the stomach . Most attacks of acute indiges tion , and of so called stomachache , or gas tric disturbance , really occur in the in testines , where rejection by reverse action is impossible . This compels us to fall back on other methods of  | attack , of which , roughly speaking , two general lines will be found of most value . One is the attempt to check the activities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hasten their expulsion from the body , together with the fermenting food . There are some remedies , like the good old-fashioned , mild chloride of mercury or calomel that combine both of these properties , acting by their antiseptic or germicidal effect to discourage the multiplication of the germs , and by their purgative action to hasten expulsion from the body . And , to a certain extent , the same is true of the other great class of household and professional remedies in these conditions , the alkaline laxatives and cathartics . The drawback to calomel is that , like all remedies that are powerful for good , it has almost equal possibilities for harm if carelessly or unskilfully used . Calomel is the mono-chloride , or mild chloride of mercury , while corrosive sublimate is the strong chloride , or bichloride of mercury . Under certain circumstances , it seems possible that the mild chloride may be converted into bichloride in the intestines . It is most desirable in using calomel to take at least the first doses under expert advice and supervision , until the degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The other great group of " old reliables " in these unpleasant intestinal conditions ? the alkaline laxatives , or so-called " salts " ? Glauher 's , Epsom , crab-orchard , Rochelle are much safer and more reliable than calomel . By their alkalinity they check the reproduction of the germs ? most of which flourish best in an acid medium ? and by the water in which they are taken they dilute the contents of the food-tube . Their purgative action , preventing absorption from the food-tube and at the same time probably increasing the flow of serum from the blood into it , sweeps the offending and now poisonous food-stuffs out of the body altogether . These salts have , however , the disadvantage of being inclined to add to the griping and colicky disturbances that are already present , and if for any reason there should be any inflammatory or spasmodic obstruction to the free passage of the fermenting mass through the bowels , by increasing its bulk and preventing its absorption , they may aggravate the seriousness of the situation .  | ' There is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brilliantly effective , is far safer ; that is the free use of diluents and simple alkalis in the form of hot water and bakingsoda or saleratus . Oddly enough , we are still somewhat in the dark as to exactly how these two remedies , either alone or in combination , act . It is known that by rapidly diluting the fluid in which germs are growing you can check their giowth , because through their microscopically thin membranes they take up water like so much blotting paper . As most poisonous or pathogenic germs , though not all , flourish best in an acid medium , the alkali of the soda checks their growth . However this may be , practical experience has shown that a glassful of hot water , with from one-fourth to one-third of a teaspoonful of baking-soda in it , drunk moderately slowly and repeated in thirty minutes , will give great relief in the milder cases of acute indigestion or colic . If the second dose does not bring about a marked improvement in the situation , it is pretty safe to conclude that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and alkaline internal baths can be made more effective by the addition to each glassful of a moderate dose of some aromatic , like peppermint , ginger , or capsicum . The one thing that by all means should be avoided in these cases is the hasty swallowing down of narcotics such as whiskey , opium , or chloroform , which do little or nothing but dull the sensibilities to - the pain , leaving the poisonous and putrefactive process to go on unhindered . You might just as well endeavor to prevent a railroad collision by putting out the red light that marks the open switch . In severe cases attended by acute inflammation or intense pain , some form of sedative is necessary , but a physician should prescribe this . With the other great group of prowling " bugs " that produce our so-called sore throats , colds , and bronchitises , the same general principles of defense obtain . The most effective as well as by far the most desirable remedies against them are those that prevent their entrance into the nose and throat . The second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , both of the whole body and of the nose , throat , and bronchial-passages , to such a pitch that they can either destroy and eat up or check the germs until they can be - entangled in mucus and swallowed . Both these desirable results can be obtained by one and the same method , the abundant bathing of the whole surface of the body , externally , internally , and eternally , in pure cold air . Get outdoors as much as you can , and bring the outdoors indoors as much as possible . Practically all colds and sore throats are infections , and are caught from some previous host and distributor of the particular " bugs " concerned . So far as we have been able to gather evidence , there is not a single known instance of a cold or sore throat having been caught out of doors , and very few in wellventilated and well-sunned rooms . Is there a " Cold-Cure " ? BUT if in spite of the utmost precaution , you have overworked or underslept or underfed so as to lower your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atmospheres long enough to breathe in too big a dose to be resisted , what assistance can we offer to nature in her fight against the intruders ? To be perfectly frank , comparatively little . Throw the windows wide open , go to bed if you have fever , drink each day at least three quarts of pure water , at any temperature which is most agreeable to you , keep yourself well ventilated , well covered , well irrigated , and comfortably amused for twenty-four , fortyeight , or seventy-two hours , for whatever length of time , in fact , the cells of your body take to produce an antitoxin against the " cold bugs , " and you may pretty safely trust nature to do the rest .  | We have little or no knowledge of any drug or remedy that will either markedly hasten the time of recovery or diminish the severity of an attack of " cold bugs " ; but when it comes to making the victim more comfortable during an attack and diminishing the danger of the germs or their poisons " settling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kidney , liver , heart , or nervous system , then there is more to be said in favor of medication . As your body cells are marine organisms , and need plenty of sea-way to maneuver in , flushing yourself out well with drinks of one description or another is nearly always helpful . It does n't make much difference what you put in the drinks , providing they are at least ninetynine and one-half per cent water . Lemon-juice , fruit-juice , or the acid salts of alkalis , such as citrates or acetates of magnesia , potassium , and soda ; ten or fifteen-drop doses of sweet spirits of nitre ? or , for prohibitionists who need a vacation , a teaspoonful or so of gin , for its effect upon the kidneys ? none of . these will do harm , and may increase the washing-out effect upon either kidneys , bowels , or skin . Mitigating the After-Effects AS a protection against the final parting shots of colds and sore throats , which , like the arrows of the Parthian horsemen , they let fly over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . there are a variety of internal antiseptics that act either by passing directly into the blood or by decomposing in the body into antiseptic substances , which are thence carried to the kidney . Chief among these are the various salicylates and other derivatives of salicylic acid and , of late years , hexamethylin , which has the curious trick of breaking down in the body into the well-known formalin or formaldehyde . The dose of all of these should be carefully adjusted , because , like most antiseptics , they are distinctly irritating to the stomach , alimentary canal , kidneys , and bladder , and if taken in excess may produce some discomfort . When it comes to " breaking up a cold , " that is to say , of taking any remedy that will help the body to throw off the disease , we are compelled to take a most decidedly agnostic attitude . Most of the remedies that have been relied upon for this alleged effect are those that diminish the excitement and action of the heart ? the so-called vasomotor depressants , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the coal-tar remedies . There can be no question that any of these , in its appropriate dose for each individual , can markedly diminish the discomfort of the patient ; but wherever careful tests have been made , such depressants have not been found to shorten the course of the disease or modify it in any important respect . Like all the heart-depressants , they are , in large doses , dangerous poisons to everybody , and even in small doses they are unsafe for those who happen to be susceptible to their action . Some of the most distressing cases of either aconite or coal-tar poisoning come from the indiscriminate use of these remedies upon the advice of some one who has happened either to have no susceptibility or to have gaged his or her dose accurately , and so feels sure that they are perfectly harmless to everybody if taken in the same amounts . . In some cases the direct inhalation of the vapor from formalin , holding the bottle a few minutes so as to let the warmth of the hand volatilize or evaporate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hugs " as may have been drawn into the nose , and thus help to avert or modify the severity of the cold . But the vapor is somewhat irritating , and must therefore be cautiously inhaled and not carried beyond the point of producing very slight smarting and sneezing . The effect of opiates and alcohol in breaking up colds and sore throats is precisely the same as in gastric and intestinal disturbances . In both cases they merely deaden the nerves to the effect of the poisons that are being formed , without doing anything to relieve or even improve the condition .  |
