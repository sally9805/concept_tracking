Tea DRAGOMAN of the American Embassy narrates . YES , it ' s a very decent old gun . The chasing of silver on the stock could n't be such better . And look at the line of that preposterous old hell mouth . It 's a Cesarini ? from Milan , you know ; sixteenth century . I know a museum or two that would get it from me if they could . But they never will ? while I 'm alive . I ca n't bear to sell my things , however much people offer for them . One has so much fun in getting them , and they become a part of the place ? of one 's self . I would as soon think of selling my children ! And one likes them for all the things that must have happened to them . Whom do you suppose Cesarini made that chap for ? And what wars did he fight in ? And how did he ever happen to end in the Bazaar of Broussa ? Not that he has ended yet . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . And it was quite worthy of him . Shall I really tell you ? Beware ! I have no mercy , once I get started on my yarns . However ? the thing happened during the Bulgarian war . It had nothing to do with the war , and yet it could not have happened if the town had been less upset . What a strange time that was ! At the outset everybody was perfectly sure that the business could end only in one way . Then , when the bottom was knocked out of everything , we did n't know where we were or what would happen next . For three weeks , between the battles of Liileh Bourgass and Chatalja , it looked as if the whole empire would go like a house of cards . At first people were stupefied ; then they got scared . How scared they got I do n't suppose the Bulgarians ever knew . I regret to say that one or two of the embassies were the worst . One of the dangers of being in the way to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too exclusive ? of the truth . I have often noticed that diplomats and journalists are the most convinced that the world is going smash , simply because it is their business to be there when it does go smash . However , there was occasion to be cautious . There would be in any capital that was threatened by a conquering host . And I still think that we might have had rather a bad quarter of an hour if a beaten and desperate army had come dashing back from Chatalja . But there was no occasion to increase the general uneasiness , as did the dean of the diplomatic corps , by asking the owners of neighboring houses to let him plant Maxims in their windows , and by ordering his colony on board a steamer in the harbor , one night . Nothing happened ? except that one poor old gentleman died of heart-disease in the flurry and was given a first-class funeral to make up for it . For us foreigners , of course , there were alleviations of the general gloom Different kinds of people came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be . fore , in the common excitement and in their common sympathy for the sick and wounded . And while none of the usual big parties took place , there was a good deal going on unofficially by reason of the presence of the international squadron in the harbor . Half the girls in Pera ended by getting engaged to naval officers . There was n't much fun for the natives , though , whether Christian or Turk . They were all in a tremendous funk , each side expecting to be cut up by the other , and waiting for the Bulgarians with different kinds of suspense . It must have been rather a new sensation for the Turks . I do n't know how many of them I heard of who begged Europeans to take care of their families or their valuables . As for the Palace people , steam was kept up night and day on the imperial yacht , and it was only some very plain speaking in high quarters that kept them from running away to Broussa . But they were all packed and ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Seraglio were put in order again , after that hasty boxing up . Well , the state of affairs was such that I thought nothing when a man came to me one afternoon at the end bassy with a small parcel , and asked me if I would keep it for him till the troubles ' were over . It was a little parcel , wrapped up in the Turkish way in a bit of stuff ? a figured silk shot with gold thread . As a matter of fact there it is ! A pretty bit , is n't it ? The man told me the parcel contained his savings and a few trinket , that belonged to his ' family ' ? otherwise his wife . These people never trust a bank , you know . He was a Turk of thirty or thirty-five , with nothing very distinguishable about him except thee he was plainly not an aristocrat , He seemed to be the sort of man who writ es in his hand in the anterooms of ministries . He had a pleasant dark face , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polite . I warned him that the embassy would be no safer than his own house if anything really happened . He smil-ingly disagreed . I therefore consent . ed to take his parcel . But I told him that I would accept no responsibility for it If there was a general bust-up , or if the house burned down or was broken into , 1 could n't be held for the value of what his parcel might contain . He was perfectly willing to let it be so . He said that God was great : if any house was spared , mine would be . He merely asked me to put the parcel in some safe place , and to give it to no one except himself . And when I proposed giving him a receipt he would n't have one . He said I did n't know him but he knew me , and he needed no paper . I was just beginning to expostulate with him , pointing out that something might happen to one or the other of us , when the ambassador came into my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man took leave at once , and for the moment I put his parcel in a drawer of my desk . My visitors brought me some new and rather startling rumor , and we talked over plans for the safety of the Anglo-American colony , if ? There was question of a boat to take refuge on , you know , and patrols to be landed from the men-of-war , and I do n't know what . There were a good many details to arrange and sensibilities to consider . We finally walked back with the secretary to his embassy , and then we went on to the Austrian , and the long and the short of it was that I did n't go back to my office that night . The first thing they told me there the next morning was that my old gun was gone from its place on the wall . i ' 01 .. IN- NO.1 The servants had missed it when they cleaned the room . I was much put about , and called everybody up to investigate . None of the cavasses had seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though there seemed to be a little haziness as to whether all the windows had been fastened . As for the servants themselves , I felt sure that none of them would take the gun . They had all been a long time in the place , like the gun itself . Why should they suddenly walk off with it ? Then I thought of my man of the day before . Might he , by any chance , have hung about till he saw me go away and then have managed to get the gun without any one noticing him ? Having remerabered the man , I bethought me of his parcel , which I had intended to stow in the safe , but which I had put in my desk and completely forgotten . 1 then discovered that the parcel was gone too ? or the contents of it . The silk cover was still there in the drawer , neatly folded up . I was disgusted enough with myself for having been so careless . And I could n't even let the man know . I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or anything about him . The only possible clue to him was that he had said he knew me , and that he looked like a government clerk . He might be an employee of one of the ministries where I was in the habit of going . His valuables were not likely to be very valuable , it was true , but he would probably be just as sorry to lose them as I was to lose my Cesarini . It was rather funny , though , that the thief should have taken those two things and nothing else . I was inclined to make a fuss about my Cesarini . The police , when they came , inquired very particularly as to my age , and my father 's name , and very carefully wrote down on a large piece of paper my answers to these and other pregnant questions . They also offered to arrest any or all of the servants ? several of whom were Montenegrins , and therefore persona non grate . But they were too much preoccupied with the more immediate questions of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stolen out of the house of a foreigner . In the afternoon I had occasion to go over to the Sublime Porte . And incidentally I looked over all the clerks I saw , in the hope of finding my man of the parcel . But there was no sign of him . When I was through with my business I drove on to the Bazaars . A good many of the things stolen in Constantinople end there , in the Bezesten . You know that murky old centre of the Bazaar , which opens later and closes earlier than the rest . 1 always like to go there ? because of the way the light strikes dustily down from the high windows , and the way silks and rugs and brasses and porcelain and old arms and every imaginable kind of junk are piled pellmell in raised stalls , and the way old gentlemen in gown and turban sit among them as if they did n't care whether you bought or not , but rather preferred to be saved the trouble of bargaining with you . One of them happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this day . He makes a specialty of medieval arms . I told him , over a cup of coffee which I drank sitting cross-legged with him on a rug , that a valuable old Italian gun had been stolen from me and that if he happened to see or hear of any such thing he was to let me know . I also bought an Albanian yataghan from him , which I did n't pay for , just to keep on good terms . After taking leave of Hassan Effendi I told my coachman to drive down to the Bridge and wait for me there . I thought I would walk down , to see how Stamboul was taking the war . I began my walk , as I am somewhat prone to do , by sitting down in the mosque-yard of Mahmoud Pasha . The time for that mosque-yard is summer rather than winter . But there was still sun in the air , and there were a few leaves on the trees , and people as usual were lounging on rug-covered benches and smoking hubble-bubbles . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine . As I sat there under the trees , adding the bubble of my water-pipe to the bubble that went on around me , listening to the scraps of talk that one hears in such a place , two soldiers came out of the mosque . They stopped a moment in the high old portico to pull on their boots , and then picked their way between the benches to one farther than mine from the main thoroughfare through the yard . One of them was a tall , thin , sullen-looking fellow with a frowzy red moustache and funny eyes . They looked as if they might be yellow . The other , I presently made out , was none other than my friend of the parcel . I watched them give their order and sit down ? my man with his back toward me , the red-haired one facing me . He caught me looking . What is more , as soon as I got up and went toward them he slipped away through the nearest of the arched gates of the yard . I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he stared at the arch , but he certainly looked not a little surprised when he saw me . It did not strike me that he looked too pleased , either ; nor was I delighted at the prospect of what I had to tell him . But I was also rather curious about his friend . And , naturally , I did not forget my gun . However . we exchanged the necessary greetings and I was invited to have a coffee . You will not wish to drink a coffee with me , ' I told him , ' when you hear that I have lost your parcel . ' I was right . His face changed instantly . ' Lost ! How lost ? ' he asked . ' Was it no ' in the embassy ? ' am very sorry , ' I said , but I was called away yesterday , as you saw . I did not go back till this morning , and then I found it was gone . Some one must have got in during the night . ' I looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get what he could from the other 's face . Have ? have you looked everywhere ? ' he stammered at last . ' The servants ? do you know them ? ' ' Better than I know you , ' I permitted myself to answer . ' And ? have you told the police ? ' ' Yes . They came , and asked questions , and made a djournal , and ? ' Before Iliad time to say anything else or tell the man about my own loss , ? and see how he would take it , ? he was MI in turn through the arch by which his friend had vanished . What is more , he neglected to pay his bill , as the coffee-house man reminded me when I started after him . I paid it , and my own too , and felt rather a fool for being so slow . But by that time there was no telling what had become of them , in that tangle of little streets . Besides , I have lived here so long that I have become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to change hands once inure in its long career , I told myself , I could not stop it . And if it was written that the Cesarini should collie hack , why come back it would ? as you see it . did ! And after all it was rather pleasant to have something to think about besides the eternal politics of the hour . I do n't know whether my friend found his friend . But I did , no later than that night . There was a dinner on board the Angry Cat ? as the English sailors amusingly called the French ( ' rouser Henri Quatre . We had a first- rate dinner of course , and chit-chat afterwards , and it was quite late when the Angry Kitten ? otherwise the motor launch of the Angry Cat ? started to put us ashore . We had still a good bit to go when shots cracked not far away , in the direction of the Bridge . We veered around to see what was up , for we all felt a certain responsibility . When we arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police boat ; but they softened down when they saw the French sailors . I spoke to them in Turkish , too , and told them who we were , and asked if we could do anything . The spokesman of the police boat thanked me politely and said no ; there was nothing ; lie would not trouble us to stop . By which he meant lie would trouble us to retire as promptly as we might . We accordingly did so . But as we stopped and put about we had time to take in a curious scene . The patrol boat lay to under the big black stern of a steamer . There was a buoy near by , and a covey of lighters , and the current slapped past them in the stillness . Beside the police boat was another rowboat , one of the sandals that ferry you back and forth across the harbor . In the light of an electric spark we saw a patrolman handcuffing the boatman of the sandal ? a big black Laz who evidently did not like it ? and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the light traveled up him and we s " thir he ? was lying flat , back across the stern thwart , dead . And I recognized him with a jump as the frowzy red soldier I had seen that afternoon at Mahmoud Pasha 's . It gave me something more to think about . I looked for the man of the parcel , but I did n't see him . What I did see was another parcel , a big one , which the patrolman turned his attention to when he had handed the Laz over to his companions . The bundle was done up in canvas , which the patrolman ripped open with his knife . In the gash appeared something green . Smuggling ? ' I asked , as we started back . ' Eh , ' answered the man who had spoken before , ' smuggling , deserting . It is nothing . ' And he turned to the man in the sandal . ' Never mind now what is in the bundle . We can attend to that when we get back . ' If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me know . We had a robbery last night . ' The Angry Kitten sputtered away toward Top Haneh . There was talk and speculation of course , and one Turkish soldier more or less made no essential difference to us . But I could n't get the scene out of my head ? the stern of the steamer half invisible in the dark , the huddled lighters , the two boats , the stooping figures , and the ghastly soldier with the frowzy red moustache . The next morning a messenger came to me from the Prefect of the Port and asked if I would be good enough to go to his headquarters . Under ordinary circumstances , of course , the Prefect would give himself the pleasure of corning to me ; but the circumstances were not quite ordinary , and if I could find it in me to waive ceremony , ? and so on . I was only too willing to go if the expedition would result , as I felt sure it would , in the recovery of my Cesarini . Moreover , I wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I might be able to contribute a thread or two . I went down at once to the Prefecture of the Port , where I was received with extreme courtesy , taken into an inner sanctum , put into an uncomfortable red arm-chair , and treated to coffee and a catechism on the latest and most fantastic rumors of the war . You may be sure it was with some impatience that I submitted to it . But I have discovered that it pays a diplomat to hi diplomatic . By conforming to the ens-toms of the country , especially in little matters of etiquette , you arrive at matters more essential sooner than by any Anglo-Saxon brusqueness . Well , when coffee and politics were disposed of at last and cigarettes were well going , the Prefect excused himself a moment and retired to a small inner cupboard of a room . From it he brought back , not my Cesarini , as I expected , but an old dagger , of which the gold haft was tipped with a stupendous emerald . It was so huge that it looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble to set green glass on such a dagger ? The gold of the sheath was beautifully wrought with little arabesques and flowers , and in the curved steel of the blade was a gold marquetry inscription ? a Persian distich , as I presently made out . Is that yours ? ' inquired the Prefect , politely handing me the dagger . Good heavens , no ! ' I replied . ' I only wish it were ! It was a gun I lost . Did n't you find it ? ' Ah ! ' he said , apparently disappointed . ' Unfortunately not . ' And he added , ' We heard it was a weapon . We thought , possibly ? ' Tableau ! It seemed to me delightfully characteristic of police in general and of Turkish police in particular . What they thought , heaven knows , Did they think that anybody connected with an embassy , and an American , was able to lose such treasures as that dagger ? I have always thought , at any rate , that I was an ass not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew what the thing was and where it came from . It stupefied me that they should not know too . It belongs much more to you than to me , ' I said . ' It came from the Treasury of the Seraglio . ' The Treasury ! ' he smiled . ' Im-possible ! ' ' Everything is possible in this world , my dear sir , ' I retorted ? even that a Turk should not know the dagger of Sultan Selim the First when he sees it . But if you do n't believe me , send for Said Bey . ' Said Bey is the curator of the Seraglio , and a charming old boy . My heart warmed to him from the day I saw him superintending the cutting down of a dead cypress near the library of the palace , in such a way that it should not injure the marble of the kiosque or the smallest twig of neighboring cypresses . And he instantly planted another one in exactly the same place . The Prefect of the Port sent , not for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gravely deliberated . Then they produced for my inspection an enormous piece of embroidery ? flowers in colors and gold on white satin . It was the sort of thing you see on good Bulgarian towels , but better than anything I ever saw or dreamed of . It was lined , I noticed , with a thick green silk . ' All ! ' I said . ' Is that what the things were wrapped up in ? ' ' Yes . Is it from the Treasury , too ? ' That particular piece I did n't remember , al though I had seen other things like it ; but I did remember a certain gold Greek coin that I had often envied , with a galloping quadriga on the reverse . There were a dozen or so fine coins . They also produced an aigrette set in rubies and diamonds , such as the sultans used to wear on the front of their turbans , and a robe or two of magnificent old stuff , and some gold filigree zarfs ? coffee-cup holders ? studded with precious stones , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of handfuls of loose jewels . Even if I had not been perfectly sore about the dagger and the coin , the other things would have left me with not the slightest doubt . They could have come only from the Seraglio ? though the merest fraction of a fraction of what is lost in that amazing place . How they got into a sandal in the harbor , however , remained obscure even when the Prefect of the Port and I compared our respective notes on the red-haired man and his dark friend . I only learned that he had been shot by accident , after the police hailed him and he refused to stop . Nor did the Treasury people , when they appeared on the scene , throw much more light on the subject . The red-haired man , whose body they were taken to look at , they knew nothing about . My man sounded like any one of several of their employees who had at different times enlisted or been drafted for the war . They asked me to see if I could identify him among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The only possible explanation of the robbery was that it had been committed during the hasty packing up of the treasures , against the arrival of General Savoff . Said Bey 's astonishment and chagrin were unbounded when he identified the loot at the Prefecture of the Port ; but it was nearly the end of him when he eventually found out that the loss was much greater than could be covered by the bundle of the sandal . And , worst of all , one of the missing objects was one of the glories of the Treasury ? the matchless , the priceless pearl-necklace of the Seraglio , the one picturesquely known as the River of the Moon . The like of it , I suppose , does not exist anywhere else in the world . Modern millionaires may have as much money as ancient emperors , but they have , after all , more conscience and less imagination . And certainly few necklaces have had such a history . The River of the Moon first came to light in Ispahan , where Shah Abbas the Great collected its seventy-seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his queens . A hundred years later Sultan Mourad IV brought it in triumph to Constantinople among the spoil of his Persian wars . Sultanas wore it and sighed for it in the Seraglio . In our own time Abd-ul-Hamid , that great lover and connoisseur of jewels , took it to Yildiz ? with a good many other things he had no personal right to . When his jewels were sent to Paris to be sold , the River of the Moon went with them , by mistake , and a special embassy was sent to bring it back ? to the no small disgust of the people in Paris . And now it was gone ? no one knew where . I believe Said Bey would have preferred that the empire had gone . He begged me to say nothing till the fullest possible investigation could be made . Of course I told him , too , my part of the story , and showed him my bit of figured silk . He said that , it was very good , but did n't come from the Treasury . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been a receiver of stolen goods , and if I had not held in my hand , without knowing it , the River of the Moon . IV So I did n't get my Cesarini back that time . That , to me , was the more important loss , though for the rest of them it was of course forgotten in the greater loss of the Treasury . But I did get it in the end , as you see . It was a long time afterwards , when the war was over , and the international squadron had gone and some of the young ladies in Pero were already married to their officers , and the rest of us settled down to the humdrum treadmill of life . I used to go over to the Bezesten every now and then and interview my friend Hassan Effendi . He never got wind of my gun . He was indefatigable , however , in trying to console me with other antiques , of one kind or another . And I ca n't say that I was always strong-minded enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' occasion ' he bad heard of . There was a refugee woman over in Scutari somewhere who had a few things to sell . They were quite good , he heard - if any of them were left . The lady 's husband had been a great man in his country , in Macedonia , and they had been ruined by the war . If I liked to go with him and see what there was to see , a man he knew would take us . I jumped at the chance . Some of my friends who did relief work among the refugees picked up very decent things ? embroideries chiefly ? at ridiculous prices . It was a charity to the poor creatures to take them off their hands ! Accordingly I arranged with Hassan Effendi to call his man and take use over on the next Friday , when the Ile. zesten would be closed . We had quite a time . The house was at the top of the town , near the big cemetery . Our guide made us leave the carriage before we got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too badly paved to drive through . When we reached the door we knocked an age before any one answered , and then there was discreet calling to know who we were and what we wanted , and much flipflapping of slippers , and finally the door opened six inches and we squeezed into a little court with a well and half a dozen chrysanthemum pots . We took off our shoes and walked up a clean little pair of stairs into a clean little room where there was a divan and a charcoal brazier and a cat ? not an angry one . We sat down on the divan and played with the cat , and presently the door opened far enough to admit a tray and three cups of coffee . In the course of time the tray was passed back and parley exchanged with a preternaturally high voice . Old-fashioned Turkish ladies affect that tone . And after hesitations , and assurances that there was nothing in the house worth looking at , what should I see poked through the crack of the door but my Cesarini ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As for me , I was so surprised that I had time to remember to hold my tongue . When Hassan Effendi put the gun into my hands I saw that it had been badly used . It was rusty and battered , and there seemed something unfamiliar about it . But there could be no doubt of its being my Cesarini . Before I had finished looking it over , our invisible hostess sidled into the room . She went to the brazier and poked it a bit with those funny little iron tongs they have , and then she flopped down on the floor . If there was to be a bargain I suppose she wanted to have a hand in it . All we saw of her was a pair of rather fine black eyes and a hand with henna'ed nails that held her shabby black charshaf in front of her mouth . This is rather an interesting old . piece of yours , Hanum , ' I remarked . ' May I ask where you got it ? ' ' It belonged to my husband , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to the war . ' And she jerked her charshaf up to her fine eyes , which filled with tears . They did not soften me too much . ' This does not seem to be Turkish work , ' I went on . I am a refugee , ' came from behind the charshaf . ' We lived in Uskiib . The work there is different . There are many Albanians . ' ' Ph ! ' I exclaimed . I knew the thing to do was to buy back the gun and go ( juicily away and call the police , but an irresistible temptation came to me . I got up as if to examine the gun in a better light . I stayed up , in front of the door . ' Excuse me , Hanum , ' I began , but did your husband have red hair ? I think I knew him a little . ' The charshaf descended far enough to reveal one of the fine eyes . No ! ' the owner of it , after a moment , very decidedly replied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the parcel to a house in Pera . He did not say he came from Uskiib . ' The fine eye regarded me very fixedly , and I regarded the fine eye . Perhaps you did not know , ' I hazarded , that this gun came from the same house , and was taken from it on the same night as the parcel . Perhaps you thought it came from the ? place where the other things came from . ' It seemed to me that the fine eye measured the relative distances of itself and myself from the door . At all events it presently disappeared behind the charshaf for inward consideration . But there are one or two things I do n't understand , ' I pursued ? ' such as how your husband got the gun . For he was not in the boat when the red-haired man ? died , and neither was the gun . ' Hassan Effendi and the other man began to show such signs of interest in this somewhat one-sided dialogue that I regretted having started it . As for the fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high voice finally vouchsafed , in defense , ' That was not the work of my husband . The other man threw it into a lighter just before ? ' ' Ah ! ' I exclaimed , a light breaking upon me . ' Then there were two bundles ! And fiat was what happened to the necklace ! ' Both eyes emerged from the charshaf . No , they got that . ' No , they did n't get that , ' I contradicted . ' They are still looking for it . ' The fine eyes stared so indubitably that I wondered if my light had been a false one . Then another light came into them . So he would have lost it after all , the dog-born dog ! It was all his work . My husband never would have thought of it without him . And afterwards he watched my husband go to your house , and he stole that too . And then he tried to run away ? ' The light in the fine eyes darkened to sudden tears , and this time sobs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well enough now what had happened ? though the woman had not told me all that it might be interesting to know about her husband and the red-haired man , and there were details of the history of the gun during its journey from the lighter to my hands that might be filled out in several ways . But I was an idiot to try the third degree myself ? and bungle it ; for it would be harder now to get the police , or for them to find out just who our guide might be . He sat there quietly enough while the woman cried on the floor and I stood in front of the door and wondered if the River of the Moon were around her neck all the time , or whether the red-haired man had got rid of it , and what I ought to do . I fingered the gun as I wondered , trying not to look as much of a fool as I felt . Incidentally I found out why the gun had seemed unfamiliar . It was heavier than I remembered it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At least , some kind of wadding had been rammed into the barrel . I started picking at it , as well as I could from the bell mouth . In the end , you know , it was n't pure nervousness , it was pure inspiration . When I could n't get my hand in any farther I took the tongs from the brazier . The last of the stuff was jammed in pretty hard . But those blessed little tongs were just the thing for it . And finally out rolled a prodigious pearl , and after it rolled a whole river of them ? the River of the Moon ! The sudden patter of the pearls on the floor made the woman look up . And what a look it was , as the poor wretch realized what had been in her hands and what she had lost ! To be sure she began grabbing up the pearls as fast as she could . And so did Hassan Effendi and the other man . You should have seen the scramble . Even the cat went for them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as soon as I could , and emptied the rest of the pearls into my handkerchief . Hassan Effendi put his there too . And you , ' I said , turning to our guide . Excuse me , effendim , ' he began , you bought the gun , not the pearls . ' I gave him a look and an answer . I have bought nothing yet . This is my own gun , which was stolen from my house . And these pearls were stolen too ? from the Sultan . And the Sultan 's arm is long . And if you say one word , or refuse to give back one pearl , Hassan Effendi has only to clap his hands and fifty men will break into the house . ' I do n't know whether he believed me or not . But he saw that I knew more than he had thought , and Hassan Effendi had the grace not to look astonished . The man put down his pearls . The woman did likewise . Now tell me , ' I said to her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she answered . I suppose you have sold the rest , eh ? ' No , vallah ! ' she insisted . If there was anything , the lightermen took it . We heard there was talk among them and we went to them . We knew ? And then my husband went away , ' she con-tinned hastily , ' and they brought me only this gun . ' She covered her face again and began to cry . There was something queer about it . lita I had found my Cesarini , and the Hirer of the Moon , and it seemed to me that the woman was punished enough ? and for what very likely was not her fault . Neither she nor her husband , at all events , had stolen my gun . Accordingly I offered her a tip , which she would n't take . So I put it down on the sofa , and patted the cat , and gave our guide a bit of a scare by making him come away with Hassan Effendi and me . But , really , you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collectors have no consciences , and will rob the fatherless and the widow without turning a hair , if so be they can cheat them over the price ? of an old print . I did it myself no later than last week , when I came across some Piranesis at the sale of the goods of a deceased Italian barber , whose family were going home . They were real ones , too , and not the reprints the Italian government has made from Piranesi 's plates . Not many other people thought it worth while to go to a barber 's sale , and the ones that did thought nothing of some black old pictures of an unfamiliar Rome . Our good Perotes , you know , are not very much up on that sort of thing . So I had the courage to march . away with the ten of them at five piasters apiece . But until I looked at those pearls by myself at home I never realized how shallow-rooted a virtue honesty may be . If I had not taken such a high moral tone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a cat had n't known I had them , I do n't believe I could have given them back . They were perfectly lovely in themselves , like great drops of crystallized moonlight . And it was so strange to hold them in one 's hand , and wonder what divers first brought them out of the Persian Gulf or the Indian Ocean , and by what extraordinary roads they had come together in Ispahan , and on what soft breasts they had lain , and what splendor and blood and mystery they had seen . Each one of them must have been fatal to some hand that had held it . And each one of them was the equivalent of so much release from struggle and anxiety , the equivalent of so much leisure , so much beauty , so much joy , so much of everything that people really want in this world ? each one ! While the whole lot of them ? It made one 's head turn . When I came to count them I discovered there was one missing . I could n't find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my gun , I could n't find it anywhere . I finally concluded that it must have rolled under the sofa in Scutari , and I nearly rushed back to get it . But then I remembered how the woman had looked when she saw the pearls dropping out of the gun . I had a fellow feeling for her . I knew in my heart that it was only an accident if I was any better than she was . I decided to give her and the cat the chance of finding it . The first thing the next morning , I took the River of the Moon back to Said Bey . It was not safe with me an instant longer . The old boy nearly went silly when he saw the pearls . He knew every one by its size and weight and some invisible individuality . He was so delighted to get the seventy-six that he made no bones about the seventy-seventh , or my cock-and-bull story of having promised on his behalf that no questions should be asked . I did drop a discreet hint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They made quite an international incident of it ? not the lightermen , but the Palace people . They gave me a decoration . But I thought the woman in Scutari had the best of the bargain .
