txt one of the two performers in the act , was dropped several hundred feet to the ground yesterday afternoon when his second parachute failed to open . He received injuries which may prove fatal . His partner , Thomas Moore of Jacksonville . Fla. , was compelled to wait on the roof of a house where he had landed until a neighbor had unlocked the doors , the family being away . He was kept there in forced inactivity for nearly half an hour . although he could see that his fellow-performer was injured seriously . Taylor was picked up by some bystanders and hurried in an automobile to St. Mary 's Hospital in Passaic , where it was said the shock had caused a blood tumor to form on the spire and the patient might not recover . Moore and Taylor have just come from the South , and were hired by the managers of the amusement park to perform their act . They tried it yesterday for the first time . Both men were to ascend in a large balloon and after a height of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut loose " in one parachute , to'which was attached another for use after he had gone half way to the ground . It was the failure of this second parachtite to open which caused the performer 's accident . Moore was to ascend still higher and then duplicate his partner 's performance . Both men Were friends of Fred Owens the young aeronaut who recently astonished lower New York by appearing over it in a dirigible , and fetched up disastrously among the branches of a tree in Brooklyn . His apparatus was stored in Hillside Park and Moore and Taylor used parachutes that belonged to him in their performance yesterday . The ascent was made shortly after 5 o'clock . The big balloon went up from a field in the park in good style with the two men clinging to its rigging . As it ascended it could be seen that it was drifting with the wind over toward Nut- ' ley . When it was so high in the air as to seem only a speck , a figure could be seen to detach itself and fall outward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then start downward easily . It was estimated that Taylor was nearly a thousand feet in the air when he made his jump . When he had reached an altitude of about five ' hundred feet the spectators could see that he was making ready to cast off the first parachute and drop in the second . The droa came , and every one looked for the second wind-umbrella to open and put an end to the speed with which he was falling . But it did not open . The performer squirmed and twisted on his ropes in an effort to jar the fastening loose , but he was helpless . The crowd gasped . Taylor was falling like a spent skyrocket . As he disappeared under the sky line the crowd rose and started on a run in the direction where he had been seen to fall . All thought of the second performer who was , about to duplicate Taylor 's feat was lost to most of their minds . Taylor ended his drop in a field on the edge of Nutley , about a mile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fell in a. heap on the ground . The parachute fell on him . tip to the last minute he had been struggling with it , but the only service it had done him was to offer sufficient resistance to the wind to keep him falling feet first . If he had lost his nerve and let go , he would have landed on his upper body or his head and probably would have been killed instantly . Several persons were near at hand when he fell , - and these rushed into the field. : To their surprise they found that Tay lot was not dead . He was not even unconscious , and between the groans that , he ccaild not-suppress they learned that ' his injury was in the back . He was car- , ried to an automobile owned by J. N. : Bartlett of ' NutThy and rushed on the : twenty-minute drive to St. Mary 's Hospital in Passaic . When the doctors examined him there they said that the sud- : den stoppage when he was in an 4. - rect position had sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it probably would , be found that a blood tumor had been ' formed . They set about relieving this , and last night it was said that he had a chance for recovery . Meantime , Moore . more than 1,500 feet in the air . had seen the accident to his Partner , whose course he had been following . He could not afford to wait . however . and see the outcome , as the balloon was not only drifting , but taking him higher . He cut loose and made the first drop in safety . When he came , within five hundred feet of the ground ho jumped with the second parachute . trusting for a better result than Taylor had m et with . His apparats did not fail him , and presently he landed half a mile from his starting place on , roof of a ' house in Whitford Avenue in Nutley : owned by Otto Bluhm , a stock broker. : After he had been let down through the : house he hastened to the hospital to see Taylor . DID @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30 Feet , but He Came Down Suddenly . Thomas Murphy of 168 Webster Avenue , an employe of the Edison Illuminating Company , was in the Brooklyn Subway excavation at Fourth Avenue and Tenth Street yesterday morning at 9:30 o'clock splicing cables . He had with him down there an acetelyne gas tank , and by his side were some tools and pieces of gas pipe . Murphy does n't know what offended the gas tank , but suddenly it exploded . Thomas Murphy came out of the hole suddenly . He rose up into the air some thirty feet . he thinks , and then came down again . The breath was out of him and he could not talk . Policeman Lush , who saw him go up , called an ambulance , which hurried him away to Seney Hospital , but there was nothing , the matter with Murphy . He told the dbctors that when he got his breath back , and went home . When Murphy rose from the hole in the ground there ' came up with him the gas pipe and his stray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ White 's home , on the third floor of the house at 463 Fourth Avenue , and landed among the family . They made considerable noise and something of a muss of broken glass , but they injured no one .
