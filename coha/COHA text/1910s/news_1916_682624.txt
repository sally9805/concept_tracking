txt Guardsmen and The Times . To the Editor of The New York Times : Shortly after the ' Wisconsin troops were called out and reached Camp Douglas , Wisconsin , the Wisconsin Military Reservation , Alexander L. Strouse , formerly of New York , in whose law offices I had been employed as stenographer and clerk , was kind enough to have TRH TOLES sent to me , because . when in Milwaukee , I read his TIMES daily and liked it so well . I am now receiving it regularly . and I write this letter to express to you my appreciation for your efforts in producing such a. good paper . I have never seen a paper whose news , editorial , magazine , and illustrated sections are better than yours , and I believe there is no better paper . I anxiously wait for It every day , here on the flats of Fort Sam Houston . and rearty worry if I do not receive it promptly . ELMER H. GROTH.              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
