Notes Macmillan will have ready shortly " The Philippines , " by Dean C. Worcester . Count Ilya Tolstoy has arranged for the publication on both sides of the Atlantic of an English translation of his recollections of his late father . The Rev J P Mahaffy has been appointed vice-provost of Trinity College , Dublin . Professor Dowden 's place in the same college has been filled by Mr William Fitz John Trench , formerly professor of English literature in Queen 's College , Galway . Henry Holt &; Company announce that they are about to publish the January issue of a new quarterly , to be called the Unpopular Review . In the mind of the editor " there is great need for the dissemination of some disagreeable truths " The prospectus states that Most of the fallacies now popular depend upon vague notions that the republic can prosper with one law for the rich and another for the poor ; that something can be had for nothing ; that it is unnecessary to better the man in order permanently to better his estate , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pace of the slowest ; that policies can rise higher than their source , and that wisdom can be attained by the counting of noses . Though fault-finding will be a necessary part of its policy , the Remote " will dwell upon remedies more gladly than defects , and . . . will be optimistic  --  spontaneously , though cautiously , optimistic . " The titles of the articles in the first issue will be : " The New Irrepressible Conflict , " " The Majority Juggernaut , " " The Democrat Reflects , " " The New Morality , " " Professor Bergson and Psychical Research , " " Two Neglected Virtues , " " The Unfermented Cabinet , " " A Needed Unpopular Reform , " " Our Tobacco : Its Cost , " " Our Alcohol ' Its Use , " " The Microbophobiac , " " The Standing Incentives to War , " " The Machinery for Peace , " " En Casserole ?

" It includes authors , titles , and subjects in a single alphabetical arrangement , the subjects being intended to meet requirements of the schools and to cover the range of children 's interest . There are about 4,500 entries in the list , the alertness of which is indicated by the fact that there are references to fourteen Boy Scout books . We have received from the Clarendon Press the twentieth edition of the " Oxford University Handbook , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1913 " The Complete Poems of Paul Laurence Dunbar " have been issued by Dodd , Mead &; Co. , in a single volume , with W. D. Howells 's introduction to " Lyrics of Lowly Life . " The poetical works of Oscar Wilde have been added to Crowell 's Astor edition of the poets , with a biographical introduction by Nathan Haskell Dole . The Oxford University Press announces the publication of " English Church Architecture , " by Francis Bond , author of " Gothic Architecture in England . " The work is of an introductory character , such as is required by the general reader with no previous knowledge of the subject . It is fully equipped with glossaries and indexes , and contains 1,400 reproductions of photographs , sketches , measured drawings , plans , and sections . It is in two volumes , demy quarto . It is not perfectly clear from the preface to the Highways and Byways volume , " In the Border , " just what portion , if any , of the actual writing was done by Andrew Lang and how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brothers had been gathering material together , but the composition is entirely the work of the survivor . This , however , is a matter of curiosity only . As it stands , the book is worthy of the unvaryingly excellent series which Macmillans have had the good fortune to carry through . Whether this account of the Borderland is as interesting to a particular reader as the other volumes have been , will depend on the attraction for him of the dour deeds of the Douglases and Percys and their like , compared with the more civilized literary traditions that prevail in the Southern counties . But there is humor , too , in Mr. hang 's pages , besides the romance of ruthless feuds . As an example of this we may cite the story of the exciseman from the Highlands who used to sit under the nose of the Rev. Mr , Ramsay of Kelso , and scribble notes during the sermon with a keel-o-vine ( pencil ) . Pausing in his discourse one day , and looking straight at the offender , the preacher cried : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ born again , it is as impossible for you to enter the Kingdom of Heaven as it is for a Hielander no to be a thief ! Man wi ' the keel-o-vine , do ye hear that ? " As might be expected , the book has much to say of trout fishing , but generally in a tone of lamentation for factory-polluted streams and glories that have departed . It may seem desirable on many accounts to include a life of Jane Austen in the English Men of Letters series ( Macmillan ) , but it is unfortunate that the author of this volume , Mr. Francis Warre Cornish , should have been so recently preceded by the excellent and official biography from the hands of Mr. William Austen Leigh and Mr. Richard A. Austen Leigh ( noticed in the Nation , October 2 , 1913 ) . There was really nothing left for Mr. Cornish to say in the way of biography , and he has , possibly for that reason , devoted most of his chapters to a running comment on the novels Here his criticism of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about people with whom one is intimately acquainted , but one can not take much interest iu the analysis of the plots . In attempting to reproduce the atmosphere of the country life which surrounded Jane Austen , it may be objected that Mr. Cornish rather overdraws . " The depth of Steventon leisure a vile phrase is indicated , " he exclaims , " by the fact that Mr. Austen used to read Cowper aloud to his family in the morning " Such leisure seems to Mr. Cornish , looking from the superiority of a generation accustomed " to enhance life by locomotion , " to be mere " vacuity " " London : An Intimate Picture " ( McBride ) , is an attractive title , but the author , Mr. H. J. Porma.n , unhappily fails to live up to its promise . As one reads , the dull conviction grows that this sort of thing has been done before , and done better . The author confesses himself an ardent lover of London , and we are glad to take him at his word ; but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passing rare And sing them to a lady fair , and we can only regret that Mr. Forman 's achievement should fall short of the excellence of his intentions . To be intimate , one must be sympathetic , and sympathy is the quality that appears to be especially lacking in Mr. Forman 's descriptions . He faithfully tells us who lived in such and such a house , and frequently adds some historical data concerning the place or the personage ; but this is not intimacy . Even when he comes to such a house of tragedy as Lady Hamilton 's he will hardly pause in his businesslike progress down Piccadilly . Despite the presence of a chapter devoted to the Atmosphere of London and tributes to London 's rains and fogs , " atmosphere " is exactly that which this book conspicuously lacks . That indefinable quality is only to be subtly conveyed and may not be consciously created So far as the author 's descriptions of London go , they are conscientious and accurate , but intimate they certainly are not . " I fear this is becoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account of St. Paul 's Cathedral . A similar apology might be made for other chapters . Intimate knowledge of the matters considered is evident on every page of " The Carolina Mountains , " by Margaret W. Morley ( Houghton Mifflin ) . The varying atmospheric effects in the " Land of the Sky " and the " Sapphire Country , " the customs and speech of the natives , the roads and the rivers , birds and flowers , Asheville and the moonshmers , are presented to the reader with a quiet enthusiasm that keeps the account of them from becoming either a catalogue or a mere exercise in rhetoric . In addition , glimpses are given of vanished or vanishing modes of life So wide is the range of things comprehended within the writer 's scheme that we are told of so exotic a development as Biltmore , with , however , much more attention to the effect of the estate upon the economic life of those in reach of its influence than we get from the ordinary travel book . The volume is a little larger than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that one finds oneself skipping . Mention should be made of the two dozen illustrations , almost all of which are from photographs by the author . Oliver Huckel 's " Through England with Tennyson " ( Crowell ) suggests by its title a not too serious or profound series of sketches Indeed , these visits to literary shrines were executed with admirable facility and dispatch , with the apparent object of " doing " the Tennyson country in one short summer . Naturally some places , such as Dozmare ( in this book called " Dozemary " ) Pool among the hills and bogs of Cornwall , were not visited at all . But such omissions can hardly perturb an author who cherishes no ambition of making an original contribution to knowledge . The quotations and accounts that fill the volume are largely taken from a single source , Hallam Tennyson 's " Memoir . " The reference is seldom more explicit than " I also remembered having read somewhere , " or " Some one has said . " Sometimes it is more definite but misleading . In describing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In this diary he Tennyson says of her his wife : ' I have known many women who were excellent , one in one way , another in another way , but this woman is the noblest woman I have ever known ' " Now Hallam Tennyson , from whose account the saying is taken without acknowledgment , quotes it from a MS of Aubrey de Vere as a remark of the poet to his friend while puffing a pipe in intimate converse . This holiday irresponsibility characterizes also Mr. Huckel 's discussion of Tennyson 's poetry . The influence of surroundings on his poetry is of course too exacting a subject of investigation to be entered upon The material of his poems must be dealt with in a romantic and nebulous manner Of the ruins at Tintagel Mr Mickel innocently remarks : " Some investigators contend that they can not be quite so ancient as King Arthur 's day . " Our author is an adept on subjects where mistakes are difficult . We read with wonder that Tennyson " was engaged on the ' Idylls of the King ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceeds to enumerate " The Lady of Shalott " and " Morte d'Arthur , " which certainly date from 1832 and 1833 respectively . He concludes : " In 1885 he completed the ' Idylls ' by publishing ' Balm and Balan , ' ' Geraint and Enid , ' and ' The Marriage of Geraint , ' which was really the first idyll of ' Enid ' divided in two and completed . " The facts are that " Balm and Balan " was published in 1885 , but " Enid " had been divided in two parts , numbered i and ii , in 1884 under the title " Geraint and Enid . " The titles for the separate parts were not introduced till 1888 . To achieve these inaccuracies requires no special ingenuity , but to make thirty years stretch from 1832 to 1885 is not an ordinary feat . Erroneous statements and misleading conceptions about the most popular poet of the nineteenth century might be viewed with a more tolerant eye if the narrative bore any special charm of personal experience or wholesome enthusiasm for the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnson ( Houghton Mifflin ) , is a sumptuous holiday volume intended as a souvenir of the much-admired performances of the Russian dancers There are numerous illustrations , many of them full page and colored , by Rend Bull . A brief history of the ballet introduces the volume , which includes the plots of seventeen of the most popular dances brought forward by Anna Pavlowa and the other Russians . With some recent additions to their repertoire the author is displeased , because of a tendency to " abandon discipline and to run riot , achieving nothing ? and arriving nowhere . " From San Francisco ( Paul Elder &; Company ) comes an exceptionally handsome volume , " The Old Missions of California , " intended to be " a book as fine as the printer 's art can make it . " The missions are described in the order of their founding , and the author , Paul Elder , has culled facts from the writings of the fathers themselves and from a score of volumes relating to them , including the exhaustive work , in several volumes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publication . Among the illustrations are more than fifty duo-tone reproductions of photographs taken by Western artists . In all parts of Africa the influences of civilization are such that the primitive life , customs , and beliefs of the natives are fast disappearing . The record of these matters , especially with reference to the negro , is found in Donald Fraser 's " Winning Primitive People " ( Dutton ) . A member of the Livingstonia Mission , he came in 1896 to West Nyasa , which was then almost unchanged by contact with the Western world . On the high plateau to the west of the lake Nyasa lived two typical races , the Ngoni and the Tumbuka . The one was a conglomerate of robust warrior tribes who had invaded the region from the south , the other was a weak and effeminate race whom they found there and had made their slaves . The sole occupation of the one was raiding , of the other to find shelter in the impenetrable forest . From his own experiences among them , Mr. Fraser is able to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we see communities passing from indolence , ignorance , superstition , and lawlessness into thrift , intelligence , and well-ordered life . Where twenty-five years ago no native had seen a book , or could count accurately beyond ten , there are now " 250 schools and 15,000 scholars . There are 500 natives engaged in the work of teaching , and thousands of others who can read They have schoolbooks , and pamphlets , religious books , and above all , the Bible in the Ngoni and the New Testament in the Tumbuka language " All this has been accomplished by the missionaries , aided since 1904 by the paternal oversight of the British Government . The book contains 27 reproductions of photographs and two maps . Marshall Monroe Kirkman 's " History of Alexander the Great " ( Chicago : Cropley Phillips Co ) is a large volume sumptuously bound and adorned with illustrations that are purely imaginary but enlivening . Fully a third of his narrative is mere panegyric , and the shade of Alexander , who sighed for a Homer , ought now to be appeased . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nowadays is popularly regarded as a " monster of blood and wine ? a man of degraded personality whose unbridged ( sic ) passions and gross appetites overcame in him all sense of reason and justice " ; or that his reputation for intemperance " has destroyed the interest the multitude would otherwise feel in his personality " Even in our abstemious age we have not come to that It is true that Niebuhr and Grote , with their . eyes fixed on the glory that was Greece , and the achievements of the Athenian democracy , devoted much space to proving that Alexander was a filibustering barbarian who crushed the liberties of Greece . But who reads Niebuhr ? And not even to Grote does the general reader turn for his conception , vague as it is of the surpassing personality of Alexander . The Alexander the Great of the popular imagination , however there enshrined , may be trusted to keep down the Alexander of critical historians who insist on permanence as a test of genuine achievement . Even President Wheeler 's scholarly book in the Heroes of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so different from Mr. Kirkman 's elephants and scenery , makes the best of such incidents as the murder of Cleitus . But he does not go so far as Mr. Kirkman , who declares that it was " an executive act , " coldly calculated and to be approved by prudent men . Mr. Kirkman will hardly admit that Alexander died too young , lest anything should seem imperfect in that " superhuman " and " godlike " career In spite of these absurdities , Alexander 's story is here well told , and while the average boy could not be induced to read President Wheeler 's book with its careful analysis of all the conditions in Greece and the East , he will read Mr. Kirkman 's rapid pages , and sympathize with his hero-worship . We greatly fear that Prof. Henry C. Emery 's " Politician , Party , and People " ( Yale University Press ) will be misunderstood by a good many of those who may happen to read it . The book , originally the Page lectures at the Sheffield Scientific School in 1912 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspects of political duties and activities . Doubtless , it is legitimate , especially in the discussion of current problems , to raise questions rather than to answer them ; but the way in which the thing is done , and the implications which the author 's statement of the case involves , are matters of some importance . Shall a member of Congress prefer the interests of his district or State to those of the country ? Shall the voter stay with his party when he does not agree with the party principles ? Is the opinion of a leader more to be relied upon than the opinion of the people ? The substance of Professor Emery 's answer to these and many other similar queries is that these are serious and perplexing questions ; that they often involve questions of conscience , that in dealing with them you have sometimes to act in one way and sometimes in another , and that , on the whole the balance of safety is on the side of party regularity . Perhaps , however , Professor Emery does not mean quite this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had stated his political philosophy with more precision . Incidentally , the text , which preserves the familiar form of the lecture ; ought to have been revised . There are numerous inelegancies , and on pages 42 and 58 are sentences that will not parse " Beyond the Old Frontier , " by George Bird Grinnell , is a new addition to Scribner 's Adventure and Exploration series : appealing particularly to the boy reader . Mr. Grinnell has not made the mistake of writing down with malice aforethought to an arbitrarily assumed level of boyhood intelligence . The adult who has carried along enough of youth to relish stirring tales of adventure with Indians , buffalo , and other incidents of frontier life will find this a very readable volume , and after all there could be no better test of its fitness for boys .

" Unruly Daughters : A Romance of the House of Orleans " ( Putnam ) is not a romance in the ordinary sense of the term , but an account of the doings of the six daughters of the Due d'Orleans , Regent of France The author , H. Noel Williams . has now to his credit a long list of books dealing with the Court of France in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries . He is familiar with the memoirs and with the best recent French literature on the subject . He is accurate enough , and fair. , minded enough , and knows his people well enough , and has written , in the present case , in a clear and sprightly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubtless prove entertaining to people who are interested in what Edmond de Goncourt called the " indiscretions of history " Mr Williams himself seems inclined to write about people with tarnished reputations , such as Pompadour , Du Barry , and the irresistible Due de Richelieu . People of that sort , however , may be important as well as notorious ; and some of Mr. Williams 's books were well worth the doing . The main objection to the present undertaking is that the Regent 's daughters scarcely merit so much attention ; and of the six , those who receive most attention from the author deserve it least  --  the ' Unspeakable Duehesse de Berry and Mlle de Valois Still , familiarity with the Court of the Regent has this advantage ? it makes the Court of Louis XV appear almost decent , and that of Louis XVI actually pu-ritanical !

In 1867 , when the shadows were still distant on the horizon , M. Felon was called from the Lycee at Grenoble to become tutor to the Prince Imperial In July , 1870 , the fourteen-year-old Prince started for the front with the Emperor , received his " baptism of fire , " and in a boyish letter to his tutor described the French success at Sarrebruck . But this success was swiftly followed by the crushing Prussian blows and the mouse-trap at Sedan . M. Felon , who had remained at Paris with the Empress , telegraphed to the aides in charge of the Prince to make for Belgium , though not in the punning brevity which Republican enemies have merrily alleged : " Filons sur " From Belgium the Prince crossed to England and joined his parents at Chislehurst .

Writing letters of condolence , harboring politicians , patting journalists on the back , hob-nobbing with them , and working with them to stir up social problems  --  that is what the headstrong call " making myself conspicuous .

While the party was off its guard , preparing supper , it was suddenly attacked by Zulus , who had crawled up stealthily in the long grass Most of the party managed to mount their horses and escape , but the Prince could not swing himself into the saddle of his frightened beast . He tried to defend himself with his revolver , but could not hold out against the overwhelming force of black spearmen . The spot ' where he fell , to which his mother made a pilgrimage the next year , is now marked by a simple cairn M.

In " Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha of the Old Testament " ( Oxford University Press ) we have for the first time a substantially complete collection , in English translation , of the non-canonical Jewish writings of the period extending from 200 E C to 100 A. ID The work is in two handsomely printed volumes , the first giving the Apocrypha , the second .. the Pseudepigrapha ; the general editor is R II . Charles , of Oxford , well known as a scholarly student of this branch of Jewish literature The first volume contains all the books commonly regarded as apocryphal ( those , namely , given in the Septuagint and the Latin Vulgate , but not in the Hebrew Bible ) except Second Esdras ( Fourth Ezra ) , which , as claiming a false authorship , is put in the second volume ; on the other hand , Third Maccabees , contrary to the usual custom , is inserted here . In the second volume are given Jubilees , the Letter of Aristeas , the Books of Adam and Eve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs , the Sibylline Oracles , the Assumption of Moses , Second Enoch ( the Secrets of Enoch ) , Second Baruch ( the Syriac Apocalypse ) , Third Baruch ( Greek Apocalypse ) , Fourth Ezra , and the Psalms of Solomon ; and , further , four books ( Fourth Maccabees , Pirke Aboth , the Story of Ahikar , and Fragments of a Zadokite Work ) , which , though not pseudopigrapha , are added as reflecting certain ideas of the time . In regard to this arrangement in the two volumes , it may be observed that the Wisdom of Solomon and the Epistle of Jeremy appear under false names , and it is not clear why they stand in the first volume , while Fourth Ezra is removed to the second . The few Apocryphal books omitted are of little or no importance for the religious history of the time .

The various views held by scholars are stated and examined , and extensive bibliographies are given Thus the student of the non-canonical literature may gain a knowledge of the questions to be solved , even the most recent , and of the material available for their solution He will find here also a view of the whole field , and will be able to compare book with book and critic with critic more conveniently than if he had to go to separate volumes devoted to the various books .

V. Treed , famed for playing with her food , are stamped both in pictures and verses for their coarse habits . As the author declares : In this Directory you 'll see Just what vou never ought to be . The illustrations are in accordance with the Goop curvatures , made famous in other volumes Three once-upon-a-time stories by Eva March Tappan have been gathered together in a volume bearing the title " The House with the Silver Door " ( Houghton ) . Silvery Girl and Silver Boy figure as characters in the first narrative . There are occasional drawings by Emily Hall Chamberlain .

A story by Annie Fellows Johnston , called " Miss Santa Claus of the Pullman " ( Century ) , is a mild narrative which seeks to reform young Will'm 's idea of stepmothers . At times the story borders on the sentimental , but it is a book well suited to youngsters five and six years of age . Some years ago Dr Headland gave us a " Chinese Mother Goose " ; this year we meet with Mary Fenollosa 's " Blossoms from a Japanese Garden " ( Stokes ) , a unique bouquet of child-verses The illustrations in color are by Japanese artists , delicately tinted and quaint in their interpretative spirit .

These publishers are to be commended for the biographical series of which this record of Bruce is one We can well imagine the delight with which the expectant youngster will receive Chelsea Curtis Fraser 's " Every Boy 's Book of Handicraft , Sports , and Amusements " ( Dana Estes ) , wherein every conceivable activity of youth is prescribed for : woodworking and electricity , printing and collecting , camping and gardening , to mention only a few .

" Nevertheless , this atlas presents the fundamental principles of economic geography in such compact and workable form that it is adapted to still wider use Though smaller in bulk and scope , Mr Allen 's work bears a resemblance to the excellent older " Handels-Atlas zur Verkehrsmid Wirtschaftsgeographie " of Scobel , and in one particular is superior , in that it contains a voluminous index The maps are arranged in two main divisions , of which the first contains such general maps as are necessary to lay the foundation for teaching the principles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ topography , ocean depths , the distribution of rainfall , ocean currents , drainage basins , and other similar factors in man 's physical environment .

The second main division of the book contains a number of plates of each of the continents , arranged in a consistent series , and exhibiting their subject-matter in sufficient detail to serve a variety of purposes , including regional study .
