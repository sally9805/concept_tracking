FACTORS IN ROWING WHEN one sits on an observation train in the hot June sunshine and watches the slender eight-oared shells sli smoothly along through the water of th Hudson at Poughkeepsie or of th Thames at New London , it all looks s simple and easy that it is hard indeed t believe that it has taken months , yes , even years , to perfect that easy , graceful swin and balance the result of which seems al most the poetry of motion . But when on looks beneath the surface appearances an studies the factors that are combined t accomplish that finished product , som idea may be obtained of why rowing ha interested many theorists and what i means to a man to represent his universit in the boat . Seated with a crowd of old rowing-men one hears the tales of the past and begin to feel a sense of a mysterious somethin unattainable in reality , but always tendin toward a greater perfection of what i known as the " stroke . " Belgian , English , or American , each has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is that each school is accused by the others of borrowing its only good points from the other types . Yet it is all only a halfdiscovered science , this art of eight-oared shell-rowing . For more than half a century men have been experimenting in boats , rig , and stroke . They evolved the sliding-seat and the swivel-rowlock . Conservatives long fought the sliding-seat and are still skeptical regarding the swivelrowlocks . Dr. Warre of Eton made some experiments in boat-building that for a time promised to revolutionize the shape of shells . But the snub-nosed shell in which a crew boated by him made remarkable improvement in time was found unfitted for another crew , and another chain of mysteries began . Here was a boat by means of which one crew , virtually without other adventitious circumstances , had at once quickened their time over the course by nearly a minute , and yet the  | next season the same boat , manned by a somewhat different crew , not only failed to increase their speed , but actually produced a slower recorded time . Had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfectly balanced stability for one set of men , and entirely lost that balance when holding another set ? Was there a harmony between the stroke of the first crew and the wave resistance of the shell which was entirely lost with the second ? Surely there is room for much experimentation in shells as well as in strokes , but when a boat in this country costs five or six hundred dollars , building for experimental purposes must necessarily be limited , or the exchequers of the boat-club associations must find some enthusiastic and rich patrons to supply the funds for such experiments . Speaking of experiments , the records show that for a time progress was supposed to be in virtually the opposite way from the lines along which Dr. A'Varre has been working . In 1865 , Yale 's six-oared shell was forty-nine feet long , while Harvard 's was three feet shorter . Yale 's had a beam of twenty-two inches , while Harvard 's had twenty-five . The Yale boat won , beating the best former time nearly a minute . The following year Harvard built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven feet longer than Yale 's , and the longer boat won . But that is to digress . Eight oarsmen and a coxswain sit in an eight-oared shell , a mere skin of cedar or paper , held in form by wooden braces . This shell is , roughly speaking , sixty feet long . The men who take their positions in the boat weigh in the aggregate approximately 1,100 pounds , while their oars and outriggers add another not inconsiderable measure of weight that the shell must carry . Then all these eight rowers gather into position at full reach ? that is , with their sliding-seats drawn up under them , their feet braced against the stretchers , their backs bent forward , and their arms extended like so many steel rods , ? and at the exact instant those eight oars catch the immovable anchorage of the water , and with the leverage of those outriggers give this human machine a chance to apply in most advantageous fashion all the energy of back and leg . No wonder that trim shell cuts through the water like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a mile in five minutes , a pace which the average man finds himself unable to hold in running , and which would mean good traveling for a horse . Many years ago a college professor hazarded the rash statement that an ice-boat could not travel with greater velocity than the actual speed of the wind that was blowing at the time . Similarly several years before a college professor had stated that the actual curving of a base-ball by a pitcher was impossible . Both of these gentlemen lived to learn , the former through actual tests on the ice , and the latter by setting up posts in line , between which the expert pitcher made the ball pass . Bearing in mind the error in judgment of these two learned men , theorists have hesitated to express themselves with decided definiteness as to the points involved in eight-oared shell-rowing with slidingseats . The question has been asked as to whether a man , placed in a boat on still water ( no tide or wind ) a certain distance from a pier , without oars or other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own weight forward or aft in that boat , could ever make it progress by such motions to the pier . This , in a nutshell , is one of the problems involved in eightoared shell-racing , and is a most interesting one . Here is a crew of men weighing , say , in the aggregate from 1350 to 1400 pounds sitting on seats so placed on rollers as to give a slide of from 12 to 17 inches . Now , when that weight is moved toward the stern , as it is when the men come forward to extend themselves for their full reach , they are supposed by all theories of good rowing to cause these slides to creep , especially toward the end of their journey toward the stern of the boat , not coming to a sudden stop against the chucks that stop the slides . Much is made of this point . Yet or aft , for the result must be the same , and no effect either way can be obtained upon the boat . In other words , a man placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the pier by jumping forward and back in the boat , whether he creeps forward very carefully and then jumps back suddenly , or vice versa . That the slide enables him to use his powerful  | leg muscles is indisputable , and that this adds speed is also now demonstrated . But how much slide to allow , how the slide should travel , and how be held , are still debatable points . But this is only one of the many involved points in boat-racing . In fact , there is no study in the realm of college athletics so interesting , and very few so complicated , as this one of boats , oars , slides , and strokes . Two men have been called inventors of the sliding-seat , a waterman named Captain J. C. Babcock and Walter Brown , the latter at one time the American chainpion single-sculler . Most authorities favor Brown . It is said that the idea came to him , in 1869 , from watching Renforth , the Tyne sculler , and his partner Taylor slipping or sliding on their seats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a race with Sadler . The sliding-seat was tried by Yale in her race with Harvard in 187o , and it was first used in England in November , 1871 , in a fouroared race for the championship of the Tyne . The value of these seats may be appreciated from the fact that Winship 's crew , rowing on sliding-seats , easily defeated Chambers 's crew , using fixed seats . Shortly after , these same crews met , both rowing on fixed seats , and twice in succession Chambers 's crew beat Winship 's . At the time , in a discussion between Mr. Knollys of Magdalen College , Oxford , and Mr. E. Warre , the latter claimed that the sliding crews would not always defeat those who used fixed seats , and concluded , " Until I see the Henley course done in seven minutes by a sliding crew , I will not be rash enough to augur that the pace of that fine London crew of 1868 and of the Oxford Etonians of 187o can be much improved upon by sliding . " But , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , said to the writer , " We have done all this . " And from what small beginnings and crude forms has this science of rowing been developed ! The original jolly-boat and , later , the lapstreak gig , have given place to the modern shell , with outriggers , adding leverage ; swivel-rowlocks , adding security ; sliding-seats , adding great power ; and a construction drawn to the finest lines consistent with holding out of water the 1400 pounds of muscular manhood . BEGINNING OF BOAT-RACING IN ENGLAND ANY consideration of the development of the science of rowing must inevitably go back to England , where , long years before there was any organized boat-racing in this country , the boatmen of the Thames and the Tyne were racing , soon to be followed by the universities . In 1715 , an actor named Thomas Doggett instituted a boat-race for the encouragement of good rowing among the Thames oarsmen , the course being from London Bridge to Chelsea , and the prize being a coat and badge . The race for this prize still bears the original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coat-andBadge Race . " In the beginning of the last century , the English universities , who had early taken up rowing , although their facilities were far from great ( Oxford preceding Cambridge somewhat in this early work at the oar ) , held their first university boat-race , and established a custom that led to the long series of races extending to the present day . The race was rowed at Henley on June Io , 1829 , and was easily won by Oxford . The competition then lapsed for seven years , but in June , 1836 , another race was rowed between the universities , this time from Westminster to Putney , Cambridge wiping out the old defeat by winning by a full minute . Three years later a third race was rowed , and again Cambridge won . After an intermission of a year or two , the race was continued up to 1856 , and from that time has been a constant annual feature . It was in 1846 that the first race was rowed with outriggers , the course being from Mortlake to Putney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceptions , the course has been from Putney to Mortlake . In 1857 the crews adopted the present style of eight-oared boats without keels , while in 1873 sliding-seats were first adopted by both boats . In March , 1877 , the only dead heat was rowed . It is also worthy of note that , though originally rowed in June , as are our races , the two universities proceeded to experiment regarding the time of year , rowing the race in 1848 in December , finally coming to the latter part of March or the first of April for their standard dates . In all , Oxford and Cambridge  | ' varsity crews have contended for supremacy upon the water no fewer than sixtysix times , Oxford winning thirty-five and Cambridge thirty , the race of 1877 resulting , as stated above , in a dead heat . What is known as the real blue-ribbon event of the rowing year is the English Henley . In 1839 , the Henley Royal Regatta Grand Challenge Cup for eight-oared shells over a course one mile and five hundred and fifty yards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that the crew be made up of amateurs who are members of any university or public school , or who are officers of His Majesty 's army or navy , or any amateur club established at least one year previous to the date of entry . This institution of the Henley Regatta has grown by the addition of other events until it is now generally recognized as the greatest rowing carnival in the world . The Grand Challenge Cup was won last year by a foreign crew , the Club Nantique de Gaud , Belgium . FIRST COLLEGE RACING IN AMERICA ON May 24 , 1843 , more than a dozen years after the first Oxford-Cambridge university races had been instituted , rowing at Yale had its birth . William Weeks , of the class of 1844 , together with seven men of his class , raised money enough to buy what was called a Whitehall boat , a four-oared construction , which arrived in New Haven on the day above mentioned . Very shortly after , other students clubbed together and purchased another Whitehall boat , as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boat-race chronicled in the annals of club rowing in America seems to have been one that took place on New Haven Harbor in the summer of 1844 . At that time there were four boats owned by Yale students , and these boats occasionally had scratch races on the harbor . Much rivalry existed between the crew of the dugout canoe and that of the eight-oared lapstreak gig . Representatives of the two crews met and formulated an agreement for a race to take place over a course from the pier to the lighthouse , a distance reekoned as about four miles . In the agreement , one of the conditions much insisted upon by the representatives of the dugout canoe was that the start should be made with the members of the crews on the pier . This was owing to the fact that , through skill and practice , the crew of the dugout were much more rapid in getting from the float to the boat and in readiness to row than were the crew of the lapstreak gib Further , as even in those days scraping of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not entirely unfamiliar , it was agreed that neither crew should do anything to the bottom of its boat before the race . On the day set for the contest , the two crews lined up on the pier , and at the word leaped into their boats and hastily got under way . The tide was running out , and a swift current went under the bridge from the boat-house pier . Both boats went swimming merrily out upon this current , but as soon as they were clear of it , the lapstreak gig , as the old records put it , " seemed to hang strangely between each stroke . The crew redoubled their efforts , but finding this of no avail , and apparently aware that some trick had been played upon them , put for the shore . Here it was discovered that a stout ring had been screwed into the keelson of the gig and a good-sized boulder attached . " The final comment was , " It was the universal belief that neither crew had broken any article of the agreement in doing anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BOAT-RACES THE first intercollegiate boat-race in America was rowed between Yale and Harvard at Lake Winnipiseogee in eightoared barges , over a two-mile course , and was won by Harvard . Some idea of the contrasting conditions between that time and the present may be gathered from accounts of the preparation for that race . The crews were very careful not to row very much before the race for fear of blistering their hands , and yet on the morning of the same day an informal , or practice , race was rowed between the crews over the regulation course ! Their idea of training was not to eat pie or cake on the day of the race . A little later , there seemed to be an impression that taking a raw egg and a glass of sherry just before a race was a good thing . As an old surgeon remarked to me once about this preparation and its effect upon a man in a race : " Sherry , yes ,  | if you please . But as for the raw egg , a man might just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days of intercollegiate rowing were marked by the use of a short , quick stroke . The boats were ordinary gigs , and the rowlocks were the old-fashioned tholepins fitted into the gunwale . Now imagine a crew getting into one of these boats and rowing a stroke of fifty or sixty to the minute . It was hard and killing work . After a couple of years of rowing , it was determined to establish an intercollegiate regatta , and in 1858 arrangements were made to hold such a regatta at Springfield , over a three-mile course , each college to enter as many boats as it pleased , with or without coxswains , the boats to have as few or as many oars as desired , and an allowance of eleven seconds for each extra oar being made in favor of the small boats . Only six days before the date appointed for this race , Mr. George E. Dunham of the class of ' S9 , and a member of the Yale crew , was drowned , and the contest was abandoned . By this time training diet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a man was fed on bread and meat , with the smallest possible quantity of liquids , even water being given in a very sparing degree . The next year , however , an intercollegiate regatta was held , and gradually the numbers entering were increased until , in 1875 , there were no fewer than thirteen colleges represented . The development of boats and oars had now advanced very materially , and the boats were six-oared shells , without coxswains , the bow oarsmen steering by means of ropes or wires which went back to the rudder and were moved by his feet . This year marked the end of the big intercollegiate regattas , Yale and Harvard taking up eight-oared shell-rowing and a four-mile straightaway course . For two years their race was held on the Connecticut River , from West Springfield to Longmeadow , but in 1878 this race was transferred to the Thames River at New London , from Gales Ferry to Winthrop Point , where it has been rowed ever since , with the exception of one year when Yale and Harvard went to Poughkeepsie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for one more year , but in 1877 only three colleges met to make arrangements for the race , and two of these desired a four-oared race , while the third wished an eight-oared race . These three colleges were Princeton , Cornell , and Columbia . Columbia was the only one who had a crew in training , and finding no one to compete with her , she disbanded the organization . The Rowing Association of New England Colleges , which was originated that year by Dartmouth , also fell through , not a single crew beginning to train . Several years later a new rowing association of American colleges was instituted , and after trials of other waters , this association has settled down to the Hudson River course at Poughkeepsie , so that the two chief events in the American college rowing world are known as the Poughkeepsie and the New London races . An American Henley has also been undertaken at Philadelphia , and this adds much to rowing interest . Since Yale and Harvard took up their eight-oared shell-racing , there have been thirty-one races , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beginning with the first race at Lake Winnipiseogee , there have been forty-three races , Yale winning twenty-three and Harvard twenty . Since 1900 , the four-mile races at Poughkeepsie have been won seven times by Cornell , twice by Syracuse , and once by Pennsylvania . DEVELOPMENT I STROKES As far as the stroke was concerned , there had been little real development in rowing since the very beginning of American college rowing until a lean , tanned youth named R. J. Cook , after a little boating experience at New Haven , in 1875 went over to England and studied the practical components of the English stroke . This man believed that a good deal better rowing could be done than American college crews were exhibiting , and that there were good and sufficient reasons why English rowing should be taken as an example . Rowing at Yale had been at a low ebb for years , and the writer well remembers , for he was then a prep . school-boy and heard more or less athletic talk , how little confidence the college placed in the methods brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ varsity and freshman crews the theories he had imported from the other side of the water .  | On the train going up to the regatta , which was held at Springfield , there was of course a great variety of opinions as to which crew would finish first , but there seemed to be perfect unanimity that Yale would finish last as usual . When Yale finished first in both events , R. J. Cook became the idol " Bob Cook " to every Yale man , and remained such for many years through his connection with Yale 's rowing interests . When Charles E. Courtney withdrew from the ranks of professional scullers and made the rowing interests of Cornell his own , he began a career of victories for the Ithacan institution that will be handed down for generations of rowing-men . It is due to his experience in strokes and rigging and his ability as a coach that the list of Cornell 's rowing triumphs stand out with such prominence . A RADICAL EXPERIMENT IN the spring of 1883 , a quiet-spoken man who the previous year had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a high stroke , and whose prediction had been verified by victory , came to the crew management with the startling statement that if they would permit him to rig an eight-oared shell according to his designs , before the first of May he would guarantee to reduce the harbor record over the four-mile course by at least one minute . Now , as this best record stood as the mark of many crews rowing over that course , it certainly looked like an impossibility . He promised to take his own chances on the results , and it was said that he even promised to take no pay in case he did not accomplish the feat . After considerable deliberation , the managers of the boat-club decided to try the experiment . " Mike " Davis , for the young man was no less a personage than this professional oarsman and boat-rigger , proceeded to equip a boat according to his plans . The crew , instead of being rigged in the usual way , each man virtually equidistant from the next , was arranged in pairs , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was eight feet longer than those in ordinary use . It was a strange sight when the crew were first boated in this shell , but there were still greater marvels to follow . The traditional stroke up to that time had settled down to something between thirty and thirty-six to the minute . This crew were trained almost from the beginning to row a stroke even above forty , and on spurts to carry it well up toward fifty . It was contrary to all the precedents of rowing at New Haven ever since the introduction of the so-called English stroke by Bob Cook in the seventies . But before the first of 11ay arrived Davis had demonstrated the fact that his crew , rigged in this extraordinary fashion and rowing a supposedly almost impossible number of strokes to the minute , had reduced the harbor four-mile course over a minute . The crew went up to New London with their novel boat , and rowed this high stroke . On the Thames course they continued their remarkable work . Many were the rumors before race-day , but the race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The foreboders of disaster , watching the crews practise , maintained that it was impossible to row so high a stroke and keep it up for four miles ; that the crew must eventually pump itself out and come to a standstill , or would lose pace with so extreme a number of beats to the minute . But from actual tests the crew themselves and iIike Davis knew better . When the eventful day came , there was probably never a crew to wear the blue that paddled up to the starting-point with more complete confidence . The race started , and at the end of a mile the Yale crew , rowing in the neighborhood of fifty strokes to the minute , led Harvard by a full length of clear water . The course , as then laid out , here ran for over half a mile over the flats , and it was from this feature that the old complaint of " eel-grass " first had its inception . The Yale boat had to pass over this shallow water , and in that half-mile , while Harvard was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harvard boat gained no fewer than eight full boat-lengths ! This is the most remarkable loss of lead ever noted in the history of these races . I give this without prejudice to or for the men who have always believed in the Davis stroke and rig . Whether it was the flats , the eelgrass , the disadvantage of the current , or a weakness in the stroke , no one will ever know conclusively , but the rest of the race would certainly indicate that the loss at that point was not due to the exhaustion  | incident to a high stroke ; for with Haryard leading over six lengths at the beginning of the fourth half-mile , Yale began to creep up , and steadily reduced that lead until in the last half-mile they were lapping Harvard and still gaining when the coxswain in the Yale boat , evidently losing his bearings , steered on the wrong side of a yacht , and Harvard won the race by less than a boat-length . Now , it should be remembered that on the record alone it stands that Yale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six lengths on Harvard , when both crews had already pulled two miles , Yale at a stroke of nearly fifty to the minute , the same rate which they continued through these last two miles . ANOTHER HIGH STROKE ANOTHER instance of the folly of contending that a high stroke in rowing must be either an exhausting stroke or a stroke that for the amount of physical expenditure does not produce a proportionate pace , was given by a crew which came out of the Northwest calling themselves the Showaecaemettes . They were generally called for short " the Shoes . " Their first public appearance in the East came at a regatta at Saratoga . This crew was a four-oared crew , and weird tales of their practice had percolated through the channels of gossip until every one was curious to know what they would accomplish . The crew was as extraordinary as their stroke . The youngest man was hardly over seventeen , and the oldest in the neighborhood of thirty-four years of age . The older man rowed with the bent back of the professional sculler . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amateur . Something of their appearance inboard may be gathered from this fact . When one looked at the crew and paid no attention to their oars , it seemed as if they were not in time at any period of their stroke . But if one could for the moment get out of his vision the bodies of the men and watch their sweeps , he found that those oar-blades were going in together and coming out together with really marvelous beat . Stories had gone abroad that this crew had the ridiculous habit of rowing as fast as they could strike the water with their blades ; in fact , a " donkey engine " stroke , as it was termed . No one expected them to cut any figure in the race , and they were generally expected to finish at the tail-end of the procession . The captain of the Shoes , being interviewed previous to the race as to the number of strokes a minute he expected his crew to row , said that they would go up to fifty , if necessary , and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at by the wise ones , who expected to see them break down or row themselves into disorder and confusion . But when the race came , the Shoes did what their captain had predicted . They went up to fifty , ? in fact , a stroke or two higher , ? and they got the lead that he was after , and nobody in that race saw anything but the rudder of their boat all the way down the course . This crew then went over to England and entered in the Henley Regatta , and once more , previous to the races , were the laughing-stock of rowing-men . But in their first heat they secured such a commanding lead over their opponents that they were able actually to drop down to a paddle when the course was only a little more than half covered , and then drew away as they pleased at the finish . The only thing that prevented their walking off with the honors in that regatta was the fact that one of their men was taken ill before their next heat , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that regatta , they were forced to scratch . VISIT OF LEHMANN WHATEVER may have been the effect upon the style of American rowing by the visit to this ' country of R. C. Lehmann when he came over and coached the Harvard crews , the result in the establishment of a greater and more understanding interest in boating through the medium of his personality can not be gainsaid . Never was there a finer sportsman or a better coach , and the only reason for his lack of immediate success in actual victories was probably the entire difference between the American climate and the English climate at the time of the rowing season . Any one who followed the work of the Harvard crew during Lehmann 's first visit must appreciate that only a short time before the Poughkeepsie race that crew were getting good pace and were able to last out even at what then seemed to American  | eyes an exaggerated body swing . But when the weather turned hot , his crew , not trained , as is the English " Wet Bob , " from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , began to go fine with a startling and depressing loss of weight , energy , and snap ; so that in this race Haryard rowed worse than they had been rowing at any time , and the very severity of their efforts rapidly exhausted them , and they made virtually no race with Yale and Cornell , who fought it out to the finish , Cornell winning . The influence of professional strokes and methods has always been apparent in college boating , growing to experiments at times , and then dropping away again . In the early days , when crews had first come to realize the advantages of training , several professionals coached college crews . Ward , the present Pennsylvania coach , was one of the famous Ward - Brothers whose elders coached college crews in the seventies . Hamill of Pittsburg also joined in this college coaching . The most ludicrous mix-up of all between professional and college coaching came in the year when Cook imported his new English ideas . He found , on his return , that these ideas were received with a great deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had trouble in getting his crew to follow out his instructions . The college itself viewed the new stroke decidedly askance . The newspapers joked about it a good deal , and finally the Yale freshmen entirely rejected it , and engaged Hamill to coach them . Then came the test . Those supporters of Cook predicted dire defeat for the freshmen , while Hamill , his freshman crew , and nine tenths of the college , expected to see Cook 's English crew badly beaten , and had no hesitation in saying so . But the ' varsity won , and the Freshmen won , and there you are . Harvard oarsmen tested themselves out against the professionals in two rather remarkable races which really left very much the same indefinite solution of strokes . Late in the seventies the Harvard crew , captained and coached by Bancroft , one of Harvard 's most successful oarsmen , decided to try themselves and their stroke against a first-class professional crew picked up about Boston . A good deal of interest was excited by the difference in views between amateurs and professionals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trial . In the professional crew sat Faulkner and several other well-known professionals , including Plaisted , Ross , and Gorkin . The start was to be at the Brookline Bridge , and the race was rowed over the two-mile course . The race was summarized by an old Harvard oarsman , who reported as follows : " When the ' varsity crew had reached the Union Boathouse , the professionals had already finished the course , carried their boat into the house , and were wiping her off . " In other words , the defeat was almost a disgrace to the amateur crew . However , this was pretty well wiped out in 1885 , when the professional crew , containing Faulkner , Hosmer , Casey , Gorkin , Kilrain , and others ( certainly quite as good , if not better , from the standpoint of physique and skill as was the one that had whipped Bancroft 's crew ) , were defeated by the Harvard crew not only in the twomile race , but in several half-mile spurts which they afterward tried . The only opportunity that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the Atalantas , an amateur crew , but with a professional style of rowing , having won the national championship at Peoria , Illinois , agreed to test the superiority of strokes with Yale in a four-mile race on the harbor . The day was a good one , and the water was in excellent condition . Before the end of the first mile , Allen , the Yale stroke , broke his oar while his crew were leading by some lengths . Waiting for the proper moment , when the oars were on the full reach and had just caught the water , Allen , himself an excellent waterman , sprang lightly overboard , and was picked up by the launch following the race . The Yale crew , with seven men in the boat and stroked by S. B. Ives ; while they lost ground for a short time previous to Allen 's getting overboard , soon gathered themselves together and maintained their lead after the coxswain and the crew had somewhat adjusted themselves to the new condition . WORLD 'S SCULLTNG CHAMPIONSHIP EVEN in the limited space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the single-sculler must have a place . The history of the single-scull cham- pionship has been one of great interest , and one indicative of the old saying that " Youth will be served . " For a man , no matter how skilful , must , in the course of years , yield his honors to new-corners . The world 's sculling championship was first contended for as far back as 1831 , when Campbell of Westminster defeated Williams of Waterloo over the Thames course from Westminster to Hammersmith . Campbell kept his power , for in 1838 , when challenged by Coombs of Vauxhall , he defeated him over the course from Westminster to Putney . Coombs , however , bided his time , and worked hard at his task for eight years . Then he challenged and defeated his former conqueror over the course from Putney to Mortlake . Coombs was later defeated by Cole , who in turn met defeat . Chambers of Newcastle and the Tyne oarsman Renforth , both remarkable scullers , were specially notable champions in the history of the sport . Later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ E. Trickett , who , in 1876 , defeated Sadler of Putney . E. Hanlan of Toronto defeated the redoubtable Trickett in 1880 . The following year Hanlan was called upon to defend his laurels against another Australian , Laycock . This he did successfully . Later , Beach , another Australian , lowered the colors of Hanlan on the Paramatta River . To-day the proud possessor of the title of champion sculler of the world is R. Arnot , and his latest victory was at Wellington , New Zealand , when , last summer , he defeated W. Webb . So now we find ourselves almost as far from a solution of rowing mysteries as ever . English rowing supremacy has waned . Australia has the champion single-sculler , and Belgium has come to England 's own waters and wrested from her best crews the eight-oared shell championship , the Grand Challenge Cup of the Royal Henley Regatta , for which Cornell , Yale , and Pennsylvania have tried in vain . Harvard crews have twice visited England , only to be defeated , and told that their stroke was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criticized , not only won two years ago against the English stroke , but repeated the lesson at last year 's Henley . Must we all now sit at the feet of the Belgians and begin all over again to learn the lessons of stroke and rig ? Perhaps , after all , the old English waterman was nearest right when he told Archibald 1laclaren , twenty years ago , " The crew that can bucket it the fastest will win , if they only hold out .
