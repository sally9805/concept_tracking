txt " The League of Nations appeals to the conscience of mankind , " in the opinion of Viscount BRYCE in a week-end cable . Either he does not include the American conscience or he spoke in ignorance of the " Battalion of Death " reservations . There are fifteen of them , supported by fifteen Senators on every vote and by a majority of Senators on several votes . Of the fifteen , fourteen were Republicans . Of the fifteen reservations , not one shows appreciation that Americans owe any duty to the rest of the world at the time of greatest distress ever known . Every reservation shows determination to protect American interests against pocketpicking by the rest of the world . And just one reservation shows perception that it is not possible for the United States to be in the world and not of the world . The ninth reservation assumes to say that the Reparations Commission shall not control the commercial relations of the United States with Germany . The Senate undertook to reserve tha ! , - right to Congress , as though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit of that reservation is secession from the world of trade , and the setting up of a German-American trade arrangement corresponding , no doubt , to the peace which Congress is to declare by resolution , with or without the President 's aid , advice , and consent . The President some time ago said that it was as hard to make peace as to make war , and the Senate is likely to find it so , if it proposes to make Germany and the United States partners against the rest of the League of Nations . That proposal lacks nothing of becoming abhorrent when its significance is understood . Inasmuch as the League of Nations becomes effective on Dec. 1 , without the United.States if necessary , Germany will have no power to accept the GermanAmerican peace if Offered to it by Congress . Germany can not secede from the League of Nations , and its commerce will fall under the control of the Reparations Commission . The situation then will be that trade between nations in the League will be promoted by the hundred billion marks indemnity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States will play a lone hand . It will be an unequal contest , for the United States can not alone equalize the ekchanges between nations , say about fifty billions a year . When conditions are normal the world 's money markets are like connected reservoirs which are kept at a level by free movement between them of either goods , services , money , or credit . Our market , if cut off from that free exchange , becomes like Europe in its present state of obstruction to access to our reservoir . Europe can not export unless it can import food and materials , and it can not import because it can not export the pay for its imports . The condition of Europe in the state of isolation which the fifteen reservations propose for us ought to appeal to the stoniest heart . According to Sir GEORGE PAISH , who confirms Mr. HOOVER and Mr. VANDERLIP , , " a large " part . of the German and Austrian " people must inevitably die OT starva " tion * * * If the German and " Austrian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nations of " Europe from destruction also . * * * " The problem now to be solved is how " to keep alive the peoples of every " nation of Europe . " That is an appeal to the conscience of mankind truly , and Americans can not absolve themselves by any sort of arrangement with Germany . Without the League of Nations- the distress in Europe will react upon us , for cur situation is the complement and re- verse of Europe 's . Exchanges with the world are as necessary to our prosperity as to Europe 's survival . We must export our surplus or go through the tortures of overproduction and arrest of countless activities . We can not ' select the reservoir with which we will connect ours and let the others go to destruction . Nor can we fill all reservoirs from ours alone . The cost of the war is put at $337,000,000,000 . The paper money of Europe totals $118,726,825,000 . On top of that are the funded debts . Into that morass we can not venture alone . Weshould drown ourselves and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nations , with its Reparations Commission . That has the capacity of uniting all the world 's reservoirs of goods in support of one another through their exchanges , facilitated by the German indemnity . Take Belgium for example . It is entitled to a share of the hundred billion marks gold indemnity which Germany is to pay . Germany 's bonds indorsed by Belgium would become " twonation paper , " aid would be the next thing to gold to any country within the League and trading with Belgium . The case is the same with all other nations in the League . They would trade with one another by means of a new sort of currency , exchanging goods , not currencies , and settling balances in the only security known with a general guarantee . The prospect of settling world balances in gold is hopeless . Neither can balances between nations be settled by domestic currencies of any sort . We must cease crying for what can not be had , and take our choice of playing a lone hand , and consuming goods with production decreased to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the world . It would be more agreeable to make other arrangements , but this is the best human ingenuity has provided , and no substitute can be improvised while millions are on their deathbeds . This is an appeal to conscience , a summons to duty . There is a promise of profit in it and a chance of loss , but the chance of loss is less inside the League than outside . But , come profit or loss , our only chance of a quiet conscience lies in this direction . It is a new sort of Americanism which shirks duty , or counts danger in its performance , or closes its ears to distress of the deserving . There is still an interval for second thought . If the " Battalion of Death " shall prevail , if we button our pockets and turn our backs , we shall be tagged with a dollar mark as a badge of shame , and shall not escape our own distress because we abandon our neighbors and partners . According to the current prints , the League project was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trial before the world , and nothing said in the Senate will relieve us from a verdict which we shall drag through future generations with distress coming next to Germany 's indemnity , unless we shall reverse our steps .
