txt In the vivacious and startAnother lingly frank letter from a Surgeon distinguished surgeon , printed on this page yesterday , On Fees . the writer denied that there was any " sliding scale " problem for him , since his charges were made on a whetly different principle . He puts a fixed price on each of the various kinds of operations , holding every one of a certain variety , for instance , to be worth $50,000 . He does not deny that particular service , however , to those who can not pay that particular sum ; instead , he.perfornie the operation and to the patient makes a present of the difference between waat it was worth and what he can " comfortably " give . , Of course , that is about what all doe1 tors do , and whether or not it shall be called a sliding scale of charges is obviously a mere matter of taste in nomenclature . At any rate there is adjustment to the patient 's financial resources and I therefore the inquiry as to the essential Justice or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The best and practically the only defense of it yet made is that of necessity , based on the assertion that in no other way can the doctor treat both rich and poor and still make a living . As we all want him to do that , the adequacy of the defense will have to be admitted , even by those obstinate enough still to think or feel that there is something wrong about it ? will have to be , that as , until they are prepared to suggest and prove the practicality of some Other system . The author of our letter confessed that while poor people usually paid his smaller bills in a way that made him happy ? adding to the money , that Is , grateful recognition of what he had done for them  --  the rich almost invariably disputed his larger charges and paid them at last grudgingly and resentfully , with intimations more or less explicit that he is a conscienceless extortloneia This he explained as due to the fact that from bitter experience the rich have come to believe that everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same notion is entertained by the poor themselves with regard to the rich , one can not but wonder whether both or either is right or wrong . In any case the social condition could not accurately be described as ideal . This correspondent said that another participant in this controversy , if really an eminent practitioner , had understated . not overstated , the truth when he declared that he would double his income were he to charge $50 for every important operation he performs . We can assure him that about the eminence of the man who made this assertion there is no doubt . There Is something Silence , Like decidedly startling In Suicide , the stern statement Is confession . addressed by Mr. Boman to a policaman called before the Aldermanic Investigating Committee ? " Your refusal to " sign a waiver of immunity was esarta " mount to a confession of guilt " That this statement startles is due , however , only to the fact that It wan made by lawyer and 171 the course of proceedings closely analogous to those existing in courts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applied in the case of every accusation . Commonly and aa a matter of course , in the informal trials of private life , the laboriously constructed rules of legal evidence and the sacred presumption of innocence until guilt has been proved are coolly ignored and the accused or suspected person is in effect required ? a ? establish his aneracity or ' honesty ' If lie can . Failure to do so , or any hesitation about facilitating investigation to bring out the facts , is almost invariably held to be confession , awl punishment of one sort or another Is promptly Inflicted . We do not feel that there is any injustice in this  --  oit of court  --  and while the plan is not infallible , while unquestionably It sometimes results in cruel wrong , on the whole it works so well that the incidental hardships are treated , if not as negligible , at least as paafeiable to an 1 evasion of their deserts We. , majority of wrongdoers . So accustomed are we to see a quite contrary policy followed in our courts that we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolute rightness in a " double standard " that until re cently has received almost no discussion . With naive faith we say , " You ca n't mike a man testify against himself , " and . that " You- ca n't deduce guilt from refusal to testify . " We really know better , and , . are not ignorant of , though we often forget , , the fae ? that , hi several : , of the Most , highly civilized countries of. ; the vicirldaa countries in innocentsirfferaiatil elite eteand , **31;803;TOOLONG 3ak1#1a ; conducted along just about the same lines as private ones . Of late , however , even in ' legal circles , it has been often and openly asserted that juries should be authorized , and not , as now , forbidden , to draw the natural inference from a defendant 's refusal to take the stand or from his refusal to answer questions when be gets there . The change , if it come , will begin a revolution of our whole system of criminal jurisprudence , for the presumption or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abolition of the right to stand silent under accusation . In the behavior after Informers their release of the lour formers whose testimony Paid Too Well , made possible the convictions of BECICER and the " gunmen , " one finds much reason for regretting that the law was forced to buy their assistance . They have , indeed , rendered , useful service to the State , but in doing so they earned no gratitude , Their motive was to save their worthless lives , not to punish or to ' prevent crime , and to attain their one object they ruthlessly sacrificed the lives of close friends and associates whose guilt of murder they fully shared . No word of repentance or convincing promise of reform has been uttered by any one of these wretches : and yet they all go free and are enjoying the notoriety which for such men is glory . They are strutting about in their familiar haunts , with full pockets and fine clothes , photographers minister to their vanity , and trips abroad " for rest " are talked about ! The spectacles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems that the price paid for the betrayals was I too high . That the testimony had M be bought can hardly be denied , and need not be , but the necessity for adding liberty to life in trading with men so little able to drive a close bargain and to make terms instead of accepting them Is not obvious . Merely to escape the chamber with the little door they would have told all they did tell . Now they are teaching every resident of the underworld an easy way to commit the most atrocious crimes with impunity . Their freedom could at least have been conditioned on instant disappearance and permanent avoidance of attention
