WHEN a few years ago Kipling published his poem entitled The Recessional , a violation of concord alleged to be found in it much disquieted the minds of many who had been nurtured mainly on the syntactical diet supplied by a certain class of school grammars . The error was said to occur in the opening line of the second stanza , which reads : " The shouting and the tumult dies . " This use of dies , we were told , was quite reprehensible . Occasionally even highly educated men could be met who , while admiring the poem as a whole , conceded , or rather assumed , that the use of the singular here could be defended only on the ground that grammar pure and undefiled must at times yield to the necessities of rhyme . It shows how much with us the study of syntax has been divorced from the study of literature , upon which every rule of syntax worth heeding must be based , that the fitness of the employment here of dies more than failed to be appreciated .. Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the rule that two singular nouns , united by the conjunction and , must have the verb in the plural . The principal difficulty with this view is that there is no such rule . It no more exists in English than it does , for instance , in German , or for that matter in Latin , from the grammars of which it has been foisted upon us . By this is meant that there is no rule which in such circumstances imperatively requires the verb to be in the plural . There would be little objection to stating it as a general principle , were ample allowance made for the cases to which it does not apply . In the majority of instances the construction with the plural is something more than the preferable one ; it is really the only one . But there is a respectableminority in which the use of the singular verb is more idiomatic and therefore distinctly more desirable . It is a consequence of this view that the number proper to be employed in any given phrase depends largely on the conception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It therefore can not be decided by any abstract cut-and-dried rule . Do the two or more words forming the subject blend into one idea in the mind of the speaker or writer ? Does he seek to make the fact of that blending prominent ? In such a case the singular verb should be chosen in order to cause the conception of oneness to be controlling . If , on the other hand , there is no such feeling of unity of impression ? as in four eases out of five there is not ? the plural number is the one to be employed . But the point , here to be made emphatic , is that in the large domain lying between the extremes the use of the particular number rests in the discretion of the writer and not at the dictation of the critic . The former may subject himself to just censure for resorting to the wrong one , if he lacks the sensitiveness to idiom which comes from the possession of genius or from intimate familiarity with the best usage . But far more likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a universal and indiscriminate application of a rule which is subject to manifold exceptions . This is a syntactical condition which many critics of speech ignore entirely and some are apparently unable to comprehend . To such extremes has this devotion to rigid grammatical rule gone , so fully has it at times perverted all sense of propriety of expression , that men have been found to stigmatize as bad English the passage in the Lord 's Prayer which reads , " Thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory . " One would think that they must have seen that the employment of is has here the effect of bringing out distinctly unity of impression . This the employment of are would have tended to impair , and as a consequence effectiveness would have been impaired . Exactly the same thing is to be said of the verbal form dies in the line cited from Kipling 's poem . Unquestionably the necessity of rhyme demands in this ease the use of the singular ; but the use of it was not due primarily to that fact . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensitiveness which is one of the most marked attributes of genius . The point can be brought out more sharply by taking a somewhat similar passage from the Lays of Ancient Rome . " Now by the yellow Tiber Was tumult and affright , " says Macaulay , in the poem of Horatills . Here it is manifest that the ideas conveyed by the two nouns tumult and affright are much more distinct than those of the two nouns found in Kipling 's line . Shouting may fairly be called a necessary accompaniment of tumult . The existence of the latter almost inevitably implies the existence of the former . But there is no such necessary oneness of thought between the two subjects found in the lines taken from Horatius . Manifestly tumult can prevail without affright . Even more can affright exist without tumult . The conceptions are essentially distinct . Yet Macaulay , uninfluenced by any necessities of verse , deliberately chose to give to the two connected nouns a verb in the singular . It may be conceded that this number is more often employed when the subjects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This fact , however , does not affect the correctness or incorrectness of the construction as a vital principle . Undoubtedly Macaulay could have here said were instead of was . This he manifestly did not choose to say , and no one appears to have had the courage to find fault with him for not doing it , or to suggest that in not doing it he had violated a rule of syntax . It is not likely that the most thoroughgoing stickler for what he considers correct grammar would take the ground that he knows more about the subject than the one writer of the nineteenth century who , whatever his other merits or defects , was unquestionably the most keenly solicitous of all about propriety of expression . Yet the quoted lines show that he went farther than Kipling in contravention of this assumed rule . Of the two authors , the usage of the latter is the more defensible , if defence be needed at all . It is further to be remarked that in the employment in such cases of the singular verb there is nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No observant reader of Lessing and Goethe and Schiller can have failed to notice the frequency of this construction in their writings . It is as common in these as it is in those of our early authors . For with us the best usage of the past sanctioned it on a large scale , as it still does on a much more limited one . Great freedom was once permitted in the use of the two numbers . But the outbreak of formal grammar in the eighteenth century had as one of its accompaniments the proclamation of the plural verb as the necessary predicate of two or more subjects . The war sincewaged against the use of the singular has been measurably successful . As a consequence the liberty formerly enjoyed by the author has been sensibly diminished . The belief in the plural as belonging in practically all cases to constructions of this sort has become part of the ingrained belief of the common mind . It inevitably affects the action of writers who may know or feel that in particular cases it is undesirable , if not unjustifiable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to defy it . One of the further results of the steadily growing influence of formal grammar over speech , which has been going on for nearly two centuries , is that not only has liberty of expression been abridged , but that men have largely forgotten their former state of freedom . Even writers who have protested against the despotism to which they are subject have shown themselves unaware of the privileges they once enjoyed . In the Imaginary Conversations of Walter Savage Landor occurs the following passage in the colloquy between Horne Tooke and Doctor Johnson : Tooke . What an outcry would be raised against you or me , if we applied a verb in the singular to several nouns ! Johnsoa. ? And justly . Tooke. ? Yet elegance sometimes requires it , even in our own language . Then Tooke is represented as giving illustrations of the construction from Metastasio and Petrarch . He adds that it can be found in the best poets and prose-writers of France , and that the Athenians cherished it . He finally meets the imaginary Johnson 's objection to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quintilian . It is often a question whether Landor 's comments on language evince more perversity of judgment or more ignorance of the practice of the great writers with whom he must have been familiar . Here Doctor Johnson is credited with saying that a man would justly be condemned for using the singular verb with two subjects . If that opinion could be thought to represent his views , he must have spent no small share of his life in self-condemnation . The construction itself is far from uncommon in his writings . To take two examples out of a score that present themselves , he observes that " the strength and unity of the alliance is not easily conceived " ; and again he speaks of " those whom the authority and avarice of parents unites without their consent . " Still there is no question that under the steady and prolonged pressure of grammarians the liberty once enjoyed by the writer has been sensibly curtailed . It had indeed been already curtailed in Johnson 's day . In the centuries preceding his own this liberty had prevailed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to decide whether much distinction was felt by many to exist . In the ninth chapter of Exodus , for illustration , we are told that " the flax and the barley was smitten " ; but in the verse following , that " the wheat and rye were not smitten . " The construction with the singular is indeed frequent in the authorized version of the Scriptures . As in it there is no employment of the verbal terminations of the Northern dialect , the examples taken from it are not subject to the doubt which besets those found in many of the writings of the Elizabethan age , especially the dramatic writings . The original Southern ending in - th of the plural of the present tense had then been generally abandoned . The occasional use of doth and hath was about all that remained to indicate that it had once existed . In speaking of England under the Tudors , Bacon , for illustration , observes that in that portion of time " there hath been the rarest varieties that in like number of successions of any hereditary monarchy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it here given , hath is not a singular form , but a plural of the Southern dialect , obsolescent even then . Far different is the case with the Northern plural in -s . This was at one time so common that inferences as to the number intended by the author can hardly be drawn with safety . It must have been heard constantly in colloquial speech from the frequency with which it appears in dramatic pieces during the Elizabethan and early Jacobean eras . The extent of its use can not indeed be gathered from modern editions . In them this characteristic of the language of the time is almost always silently suppressed whenever rhyme or measure does not interfere to prevent alteration . If retained , efforts almost agonizing have been put forth to account for its occurrence . This , too , even when the subject plainly indicates the number , as in the following passage from Richard II. , when Northumberland remarks to Bolingbroke : " These high wild hills and rough uneven ways Draws out our miles and makes them wearisome . " We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implied sense and not to the form . The idea denoted is that of journeying over these hills and ways . Hence draws and makes are properly in the singular . There is therefore , we are assured , no need of considering them as examples of a still surviving Northern plural of the present tense . This sort of explanation , carried out to its legitimate conclusion , would render unnecessary the use of any plural form whatever . But by the time the seventeenth century was well under way , this plural in -s had practically disappeared from the literary speech . In consequence we are thenceforward on safe ground . When the termination ending in -s or in - th appears in the third person , we know that it is the singular which the author has in mind to use . Accordingly what then will strike the attention of the observant student is the frequency with which this number is found with two or more nouns as its subject . Let us take , for illustration , Milton 's usage . It clearly never occurred to him that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , could be conceived of as improper , unlike our own time when , to use his own words on another subject , belief in it is for him only to hope whom true wisdom and the contempt of vulgar opinion exempts . " The construction is frequent in his prose . In his more finished poetical work it is far from uncommon . We need not delay on passages where the verb precedes its subjects , as , for instance , when in Paradise Lost mention is made of " the land where flows Ganges and Indus . " Milton 's grammatical views can be more adequately represented by the two following examples taken out of many . " Bitter constraint and sad occasion dear Compels me to disturb your season due , " are the lines in which at the beginning of Lycidas he addresses the plants symbolical of poetry . " Thy worth and skill exempts thee from the throng . " is the tribute he pays to the musician Henry Lawes . No one is likely to maintain that in these examples ? which could be largely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poet to use the singulars compels and exempts . Few , however , would be the modern writers to venture on such a liberty , as it would be deemed now . When , indeed , we contrast the frequency of this construction in a great classic like Milton and its comparative infrequency in modern writers . such , for instance , as one so scrupulous as Macaulay , we can discern how steadily the injunctions of grammarians have tended to lessen its use . It is , of course , still employed . Macaulay. for illustration , speaks of men asking " where the promised splendor and comfort is to be found . " But the comparative study of the usage of different centuries brings out distinctly the fact that , under artificial pressure , a construction once common has now become so rare that the employment of it almost invariably attracts attention and often excites censure . Here is an instance where a steady pressure , exerted for nearly two centuries , has sensibly limited the extent of the use of a particular syntactical construction . It , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It has certainly begotten the belief in the minds of many that there is something undesirable if not positively wrong in its employment . But this result has not been caused by the action of the general body of cultivated speakers and writers . It is mainly due to the agency of the special class of grammarians . It has accordingly been reached by conscious effort . The change effected has been in consequence an artificial one . It stands in sharpest contrast with those natural changes which are brought to pass by the general sense of the cultivated users of speech seeking to find for themselves relief from a linguistic condition which is felt to be unsatisfactory if not unbearable . In this case the innovations that come in are not the result of any direct conscious effort . Rarely , indeed , can we tell where they originated , and it is no easy matter to ascertain when . No better illustration of the methods which go on in such cases can be found than in the story of the way in which the idiom represented , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's came to establish itself in the language . The history of these expressions furnishes an interesting illustration of the conflict that constantly takes place between opposing tendencies which are operating upon usage . Not uncommon in our speech is a construction that chances to be one of the few survivals of the older inflection . A noun limiting another may be put in the genitive case ? or , as it is often called , the possessive ? instead of being in the objective governed by a preposition . But this construction demands that the limiting noun shall immediately precede the noun limited . It requires direct dependence . One exception to this rule it makes willingly ; but only one . It allows the intervention of an adjective , which adjective may be modified , if desired , by an adverb . No one feels any sense of repulsion in. the opening line of Paradise Lost , where Milton speaks " of man 's first disobedience . " But at the point here indicated toleration stops . No other part of speech is allowed to come in between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apply this principle to the ease of everybody else 's . Here the disposition seems to have existed at the outset to follow the prescribed grammatical path . Consequently men were at first disposed to Say everybody 's else . This is certainly found as early as the sixteenth century . But both then and afterward it occurs on the most limited scale . One reason doubtless of its rarity is the fact that it belongs to colloquial speech rather than to literary , and it is mainly the literary speech that is recorded in books . Consequently that neither everybody 's else nor everybody else 's appears in Milton , for illustration , is not at all surprising . But even in colloquial speech the expressions could not then have been common . How little headway , indeed , both these phrases must have made may fairly bo inferred from the fact that neither is employed in the numerous passages of Shakespeare which set out to represent the language of common life . The truth is that the disposition prevailed to avoid both . This could be easily accomplished by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of . Perhaps it would be better to say that one of the two phrases was not then known and that the other was disliked . It was certainly not till after the Restoration that the employment of either becomes at all noticeable . The earliest instance of the now regular form , given in the New Historical English Dictionary , is taken from our old friend , the diarist Pepys , and belongs to 1668 . Under December 9th of that year he remarks that " my pleasure was just the same as yesterday and no more , nor anybody else 's about us . " After that there is in this great work an ominous absence of quotations for nearly two hundred VOL . CXX I. ? No. 721. - 17years . In fact , so far as my own necessarily limited investigation can justify positive statement , everybody 's else was at the outset the preferred method of expression . " While I am nkv own or anybody 's else , that will never happen , " says Scandal in Congreve 's Love for Love , which came out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1714 called The Lover , recommends visiting a picture gallery , not merely to please and recreate the sight , " but also to yield satisfaction and pleasure to your mind and instruction enough to inform and improve everybody 's else . " " I confess I was your dupe as well as somebody 's else , " wrote Swift to Mrs. Howard in 1731 . But though this method of expression seems to have been the one preferred , it was manifestly one that was not liked . It was , in fact , distinctly avoided . One example of it has been given from Congreve ; it is the only one to be found in his five plays . An even worse showing is made in the comedies of his contemporary Wycherley . In them not an instance of it can be discovered . One example has been given from the forty essays constituting Steele 's Lover . It is the single example to be found in them . Still , though it was clearly not a favorite , had the employment of it been confined to the phrase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself permanently upon the speech . It was awkward and clumsy , to be sure ; but in spite of its lack of euphony it could have been made to pass muster . It would never , indeed , have been much used by writers sensitive to harmony of expression . These would have continued to prefer in the future , as they had in the past , such a phrase as " that of some one else " to a phrase so distressing to the ear as " some one 's else . " But in the further development of the usage a new complication set in . In the instances just given the limiting noun had in all cases been understood . Naturally the desire sprang up to spread still farther the domain of the idiom , to employ it when the limiting noun should not merely be understood but should be actually expressed . But any such extension brought it at once into conflict with the principle which permits nothing but the adjective to intervene between the limiting and the limited noun . One could say " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say was " everybody 's else conduct . " An expression of that sort men would feel to be intolerable . Accordingly to retain in such a case the sign of the possessive with one or body meant the denial of the further development of the usage . But the language would not be denied . It found itself , in truth , facing a problem similar to that which had previously led to the transfer of the possessive sign from the noun to which it strictly belongs to a noun connected with it and modifying its meaning . Here a distinct change of construction has taken place . For instance , the opening lines of Chaucer 's Troilus and Cressida , put in modern orthography , read as follows : " The double sorrows of Troilus to tellen . That was the king Priamus ' son of Troy . " This method of expression , though perhaps never common , lasted for at least two centuries . In our version of the Bible we are told in the ninth chapter of Exodus that " there shall nothing die of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a construction was almost as objectionable as everybody 's else . Accordingly it did not survive . To use the illustration just taken from Chaucer , the language abandoned the use of an expression like " King Priam 's son of Troy " and substituted for it " King Priam of Troy 's son . " So in the same way it took the words constituting the phrases under consideration and treated them as forming quasi-compound substantives in which the sign of the possessive was added to the last constituent , the adverb else . From that moment the doom of everybody 's else was sealed . The form which supplanted it seems hardly to have been in use on a scale worth mentioning until the beginning of the nineteenth century . But whenever or wherever it first appeared , its progress was henceforth rapid . Archdeacon Hare remarked in 1833 that " people more frequently say no body else 's ski than nobody 's else . " As soon as it came to be followed frequently by a noun limiting one or body , its general adoption in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . " Everybody slapped everybody else 's hack , " says Dickens in Nicholas Nickleby , published in 1839 . " Everybody else 's house as well as yours , " wrote Thackeray in The Adventures of Philip , which came out in 1862 . In St. Ives Stevenson speaks of " any one else 's lips , " and in the Love 's Cross Currents of Swinhurno mention is made of " every one else 's son . " Instances could be multiplied almost endlessly . It is in truth a singular illustration of the extent to which every one else 's has established itself as the exclusive form that the very existence of the other form has largely come to be forgotten . Certain it is , at any rate , that it is generally ignored . Our larger dictionaries can hardly be said to recognize the fact that such an expression as everybody 's else ever had any existence at all . Most of them do not even mention it . Webster remarks on the now common phrase that " it is usual to give the possessive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then follow quotations from George Eliot and Thackeray . The Century Dictionary says essentially the same thing . The Standard has a quasi-recognition of the fact that there are still persons who cling to the other method of expression . Of course the business of a lexicon is to deal mainly with the meaning of words and only incidentally with their grammatical construction . It shows how much the older form has passed out of thought as well as out of sight that the invaluable New Historical English Dictionary , a perfect storehouse of information on the history of words and phrases , does not even take the trouble to hint that such a method of expression as everybody 's else was ever heard of in English speech . The matter of importance here , however , is that the expression everybody else 's , in contradistinction to the change previously considered , is a perfectly natural development of usage . No grammarians recommended it ; no propaganda was set in motion to bring about its adoption . Its origin and growth were spontaneous . Its fitness and its sufficiency for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favor with the cultivated users of speech and led to its general acceptance .
