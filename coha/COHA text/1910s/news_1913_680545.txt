txt The Trustees of the National Academy Association held a meeting late yesterday afternoon in the Fine Arts Building and by unanimous vote the artists whohave been directing the association amended its charter to provide for seventeen additional non-artist Trustees , both men and women , to be selected according to their interest in art . As the first of the non-artist Trustees they elected yesterday Frank R. Lawrence , the lawyer , and President of the Lotos Club . In accordance with the provisions of their charter that one Trustee was to " be elected from Metropolitan Museum of Art , one from the Trustees of the New York Public Library , and one from the Chamber of Commerce , the Trustees of the association at their meeting yesterday also elected Henry- C. Frick of the Metropolitan Museum Trustees , Fairfield Osborn of the Public Library , and James Speyer of the Chamber of Commerce . On the principle that good artists were usually poor business men , it was decided to entrust all the financing of the National Academy to laymen , and an amendment to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of seven of whom only two were to be artists . However , to preserve the balance of power , the Trustees also voted to establish an Exhibition Committee of fourteen , of whom only twO were to be laymen . Yesterday 's meeting resulting in the important innovation of placing a fair quota of art lovers on the Board of Trustees and In handing over the purse strings of the Association to business men was regarded by the federation of artists as an important step toward realizing their dream of a new and adequate Fine Arts Building , large enough to allow of satisfying exhibitions . In pleading for adequate new accommodations , John W. Alexander , President of the National Academy of Design , who was in the chair , said : " Much has already been done for American art and artists under the leadership of men like the late J. P. Morgan . H. C. Frick , and others , firstly by bringing so many of the old masters over here and allowing people to see them , and secondly by endowing the American Academy In Rome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But , more remains to be done in facilitating American artists to properly exhibit their work . " The Trustees of the National Aced ! emy Association feel that with their combined efforts and the help of art lovers in New York they will be able to obtain the necessary funds for a fine and dignified exhibition building , large enough to satisfy the members of all the different art societies , as well as the public 's desire to see all kinds of work of the living artists . " What we want is a large and modern building with space enough so that all the various art societies exhibiting at one time can show what American artists can do . It would wake many people up . You must remember that the academy is practically the only place In the country managed by artists for artists , and whose exhibitions are not filled mainly by invitation . It is the ? only place in the country where the unknown artist can gain recognition . We need a building in which large and representative exhibitions of the individual societies or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loan exhibitions may be held . " New York , the greatest city in America , is far behind Philadelphia , Washington . Pittsburgh . Buffalo . Toledo . Springfield , and other small cities in the opportunity of displaying works of art . The limited space now available in the Fine Arts Building prevents a dignified and suitable exhibition of paintings , statuary , sculptures , and other works of art , and because of this limited space many of the most promising artists are deterred from exhibiting , preferring to send their work where it can be shown to advantage . The consequence is that in New York many small exhibitions are held , scattered along Fifth Avenue and side streets , which are not visited by as many people as one large exhibition would attract . , consequently the public has no adequate opportunity of seeing the work actually produced by our artists . e It Is a fact , for instance , that in the Spring exhibition of the academy , 1.100 pictures were sent in. and only about 300 could be hung for lack of space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as attractive here as they are made in the leading cities of Europe . The opening or varnishing day here should be made an event to attract the leaders in the social , artistic , and literary life of New York . " It is the plan of the Trustees to raise the necessary funds to buy the property adjoining the Fine Arts Building , provided it can be bought at a ? reasonable figure . but if it can not be so acquired . then the Trustees may decide to dispose of the present Fine Arts Building and use the proceeds and the new funds to be raised , which are estimated to be about $750.000 to $1,000,000 ? to acquire a new site and erect a new building . Various sites have already been suggested for that purpose. - Those present at yesterday 's meeting included James Speyer . John W. Alexander . Charles Dana Gibson , Edwin H. Biashfield , henry B. Snell . Donn Barber , Isador onti . Bert Hanson , Herman A. , William A. Boring , C. Zyant La Farge , Daniel C. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ielma.n , Harry W. Watrous , and Howard Russel Butler . The National Academy Association , which was incorporated last year and which is just being organized , embraces the National Academy of Design , the American Water Color Society . the American Institute of Architects , the Architectural League of New York , the New York Water Color Club , the 1.4 ' tional Sculpture Society , the Municipal Art Society , the Societe des Beaux Arte Architects , the Mural Painters , and the Society of Illustrators .
