THE first time I saw Mr. Lowell I dined with him at Longfellow 's house in Cambridge . I had brought a letter to Longfellow from Mr. William Cullen Bryant . I was somewhat surprised by Longfellow 's appearance . He was shorter than I had expected , and inclined to stoutness . But he was a handsome man , one of the most attractive that I have ever seen . That was what every one said of him . I remember particularly his voice , which was very musical . There was a certain agreeable deliberation in his way of speaking . Then the poet and scholar were so large a part of his nature , and he had such a feeling for the romance of knowledge and of literature . I remember the charming voice and manner in which he told me that the Italian wine which he gave me at dinner was , he believed , the Massic of Horace . The benignity and courtesy which were his characteristics bore , I fancy , some relation to his beauty . The world looks kindly upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a person should return the world 's amiable regard . This beauty and grace were no doubt qualities which had always been Longfellow 's . My old friend , George Ripley , the founder and head of Brook Farm , told me that he once saw Longfellow , then a young professor at Bowdoin , give some degrees to a class of young men at a Bowdoin Commencement , and how impressed he was with the grace , and especially with the good feeling , which he showed . As I came into the drawing-room at Longfellow 's house , when I went to dine with him , I saw a man sitting at one end of the room , whom I recognized as resembling the photographs of Lowell I had seen . He was a thick-set man , rather tinder middle height , with aheavy , red beard . Of course I knew the Biglow Papers almost by heart , as we all did in those days , and admired the introduction to the " Vision of Sir Launfal , " and some of his shorter poems . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writings . They seemed to be statements of trite and generally accepted ideas , expressed with an air of novelty and with much affectation . Until you got to know him there was something of this self-consciousness and affectation in his appearance and manner . I never afterward saw him so affected as I thought he was at this dinner . That may have been because I was expecting something of the kind . I remember he said to one of Longfellow 's daughters , You should read Vergil ; he 's the sweet fellow ! " in what seemed to me an affected and pedantic manner , although , of course , the advice and the sentiment were unexceptionable . After dinner I went with Longfellow and Lowell into the smoking-room . Longfellow was most agreeable and entertaining . I remember his telling this story : His brother-in-law , Tom Appleton , was a spiritualist ; he was rich , and I presume did a good deal for mediums and such persons , and was , as a consequence , highly regarded by them . Appleton had asked Longfellow to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Longfellow did go to see him , and was invited to put some questions to the man , which would test his ability as a medium . Longfellow asked him who was the author of a treatise written during the Middle Ages upon the capacity of spirits to move material objects , such as chairs and tables . It seems that such a treatise was written by Thomas Aquinas . As the medium was not very ready with his answer , Longfellow , in the goodness of his heart , tried to help him by propouncing slowly the letters T-h-o-m-a-s A ? " Tom Appleton ! " said the man , eagerly . Lowell had with him the poem which he was to read the next day at the Lexington Centennial , and which he had brought to read to Longfellow . He gave no intimation that he wished me to hear it ; so I joined the ladies . In a little while Longfellow came in and said that Lowell had gone home , and that he had written a beautiful poem . I fancy the somewhat affected manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to some extent his Cambridge manner , or rather his manner to strangers , especially to the young literary small-fry who came there as visitors . He was a good deal of a little god at Cambridge , I suppose . He knew but few people , and they were intimate friends or devoted admirers . He spent a great many of his evenings with these friends , meeting them several times a week for whist . I believe he scarcely went at all in Boston society . The next time I saw Lowell was in Cincinnati at the Republican convention which met there in 1R76 . He was a delegate to the convention from Massachusetts , and I was one of half a dozen New York men , who were mugwump &; or what a few years later would have been called mugwumps , who had come to Cincinnati hoping to be of some assistance in the nomination of the reform candidate , Bristow , Mr. Lowell was in sympathy with us and came to our room . He had always been the friend of truth and of honest and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposition to carpet-hag government in the South and in our hope for the reform of Civil Service . He had not the least bit of his Cambridge manner then , and showed himself to be just what he was , a friendly and kind-hearted man , who especially wished to he liked . When Mr. Hayes became President , Lowell was appointed minister to Spain . At about the same time I was sent back as a secretary of the Legation at London . I saw more or less of him in London , when he was on his way to Madrid . In 1879 he was transferred from Madrid to London . I was under him for four or five years from this time . I would see Vac . CXXXI1. ? No. 789. - 4shim daily for several hours at the Legation , and was a great deal at his house . The Legation consisted of the minister and the two secretaries , Mr. W. J. Hoppin , the first secretary , and myself . Later Commander , now Admiral , Chadwick was sent out as naval attache . Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go out in company , and about once a week Hoppin and myself dined with Mr. and Mrs. Lowell . I think Lowell 's idea in having us was that it helped to entertain his wife . He had , however , the virtue of hospitality to a high degree . At these dinners Lowell did most of the talking and was extremely entertaining and charming . When Mrs. Lowell 's health improved , Lowell 's spirits became brighter . In Spain he had been very unhappy , owing to his wife 's illness . How much he must have suffered at that time I gathered from a remark he once let fall . On despatch days , when there was often a good deal of work to be done at the Legation , he and I would be together for three or four hours and would lunch together . At such times he would become very communicative . In speaking of his life in Madrid , he said there were many times when his feeling was that it would be very pleasant to be lying upon his back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gravel . After his wife 's recovery the Lowells gave dinner-parties , mostly to his English friends . He would . however , often have two or three Americans who were going through London , and these were the evenings at his house which I most enjoyed , for if you live in a foreign country you crave the society of your own people when you can get it . I was so much younger than the other members of the Legation that , although a bachelor well on in the thirties , I think I must have represented youth to these older men . This incident , which I recall , will give an idea of the way they regarded me . A young lady from Boston had dined at Lowell 's house , and I had taken her down to dinner . Hoppin and I were with Lowell in the hall with our overcoats on , waiting to go . A hansom had been called for the young lady . Lowell said , " Hoppin , who is going home with this girl ? ' Hoppin did not seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , said , " As for you , you rascal , you sha' n't go with her . " I believe the young lady went home alone . Mr. Lowell was a very indulgent chief . I remember being late at some of his dinners ? once I think Iliad the meanness to lay it on the hansom ? and got nothing worse than , " Well , we are glad to see you , anyway , " which is considerably milder punishment than I now receive from my own relations for the same offense . Indeed , I scarcely ever knew him to make a complaint of any kind of either of his secretaries . Yes , I do recall this incident : He came into the Legation one morning and told us that the then Prince of Wales , later Edward VII. , had said to him the day before , " You give your secretaries a wigging . " It seems that we had failed to tell him something which he could not have been expected to know , and which we should have told him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in receipt of a wigging . " Mr. Lowell had to the full that dependence upon the good opinion and the friendly sentiments of others which is characteristic of artists . I think this was one of his attractions . I remember once talking with Mr. Roden Noel , a poet and a very agreeable man , about him . We were comparing him with a certain universally admired English literary man . Mr. Noel thought that Lowell was much the more attractive ? " winning " was the word he used -- a quality which was in part the result of his wish to be liked . Lowell 's friendships were chiefly with English literary men , between whom and himself there was that free-masonry which exists everywhere among scholars . I hardly think he had the same success in fashionable company . Lowell was a man of genius , and men of genius are rarely successful in that kind of society ; they have not the power of suiting their behavior and their conversation to other people , which is a condition of success in that world . I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a real gift for that kind of life . Napoleon , when in Egypt , just before a great battle , noticed that the Egyptian cannon were mounted upon wooden stands so fixed that they could shoot only in one direction . Sothat all that Napoleon whose guns were on wheels and could be pointed in any direction had to do was to move his troops to one side and out of the range of Egyptian guns . Men of genius are like those Egyptians ? their expressions have much more relation to their own conditions than to the conditions and locality of those at whom these expressions are directed . They shoot away , apparently quite careless whether they hit anything or not . It is different with practical men ; lawyers wish to win verdicts and business men want to make money , and the pursuit of these external objects is in their natures . Besides . geniuses are too egotistical for general society , too keenly sensitive to the opinions of others regarding themselves . Lowell , however , greatly enjoyed the position in London which his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him . He was really shy and easily abashed , as it is the nature of poets and artists to be . He told me one morning that he had spoken the night before at the Savage Club ? a club of literary men ? adding : " They are critics , you know , and I was afraid of them . But I did n't let ' em see it . " His official position helped to give him audacity . With the help of it I have known him now and then to do just a little bit of bluffing . He would in a whimsical manner , especially if he was feeling pretty well , express himself freely and confidently upon subjects of which he could not have known very much . An English acquaintance of mine told me that he had him one night to dinner , and that he had at the same time the celebrated authority upon classical antiquities , Sir Charles Newton . There was a difference of opinion between the two upon some point connected with this subject , upon which Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A discussion followed in which Lowell , who I dare say was feeling pretty well and in high spirits , went in and wiped the floor with Sir Charles Newton . 1 said to my friend that I did not suppose that Sir Charles Newton minded , that such an expert as he must of course have regarded Lowell 's talk as that of an amateur . " Not a bit of it , " said he ; " I assure you poor old Newton was dreadfully disturbed . " The other people there , knowing nothing about the subject , probably gave the victory to the smartest talker . When Lowell was in good spirits and in sympathetic company , he was an admirable talker . Gladstone told an American of my acquaintance that he considered him the best talker in London . When Lowell spoke upon subjects of which he had real knowledge he was apt to speak modestly and with hesitation . I remember once asking him something about Dante , of which subject he knew a great deal , and he spoke with the caution with which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is master . Many examples of his talk come to ray mind , from which it is not easy to make a selection . These occur to me at random . I remember once asking him if he did not think the passages in Lucretius about falling particles queer material to make poetry out of . He began talking about Lucretius , and made some striking remarks about the opening invocation to Love , which he thought one of the finest passages in literature . Again , I remember his saying ? and I thought his remark was meant for me ? that one important condition of success in literature was the wish to succeed . " If any one really wants to do something , " he said , " there may be a chance . But if you do n't care , you wo n't do anything . " Lowell was not himself the kind of writer to take his productions seriously . He was not like Tennyson , who could be made wretched by a disparaging remark about his poetry by a young girl . That is perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he may he in concealing it . Lowell told me that a young Englishman , on being introduced to him in Madrid , said , I never read your works , " to which he had replied , " Well , I never regarded them as necessary to a liberal education . " One evening he and I dined with Hoppin at the latter 's house . Mr. Henry James was with us . I had been reading Hazlitt 's Liber Amoris , the account which he wrote of his love-affair with the granddaughter of his landlady . Mrs. Procter , who was a friend of Hazlitt 's , had told me that her husband , Barry Cornwall , the poet , had thought that Hazlitt was so much in love with the girl that he had better marry her , and had gone to see her to do what he could to help the matter along . But he found that she had been so frightened by Hazlitt 's violence that she would have nothing more to do with him . I said that it was distressing to see a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of himself . But Lowell thought differently . He said , and he spoke seriously and impressively : " There is no telling what any one of us " ? meaning the four men at the table " may yet become through a woman . " He had spent his life as a teacher , but he had not the way of talking of men who have followed that profession . He had not in the least that way of talking down to people which teachers sometimes have . Artists and poets are never prigs , and Lowell was not . But he had to some degree the vanity of omniscience , which is said to be a quality of teachers . He really did know a great deal , and knew about a great many things . He did not like to be told anything , and he was glad to have a chance to exhibit his knowledge . I remember once at some evening party he came to me in high dudgeon and told me that a few minutes before he had encountered a certain notorious old bore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person had told him that kickshaws came from quelquechose . Lowell was very indignant . He was delightful when he was in this mood . I remember also an incident when his pride of knowledge betrayed him into an unfortunate remark . Who of us does not now and then make such mistakes , and worse ? I introduced to him the late Chevalier Wykoff . There can be few now who remember anything about WykofF . He was queer-looking enough , cross-eyed , clean-shaven , except for the little side whiskers of the pattern of two generations before , with an ' uncompromising black wig ; and wearing the dress of a revived dandy of about 1820 , a frock-coat with a high collar , a stock , and a silk hat with a broad brim very much rolled . He had a very deep voice ? almost a growl . In theory he was an utter cynic , firmly persuaded that every man and woman had his or her price ; but he was a good old fellow , with an excellent heart , and a practice entirely at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chevalier by some Italian potentate , I believe , and he liked to be called by that title . I was very careful , however , to introduce him as " Mr. Wykoff . " It would not have pleased Lowell if I had introduced him with a title . Lowell said , " Ah , Mr. Wykoff , I remember you in prison . " Wykoff had been in the galleys in Italy . Now it was not at all a case of Paul and Silas in chains , or of Galileo in the dungeons of the Inquisition . He really had done something ? just what , I do n't know . Wykoff was surprised , but he was a very self-possessed person , and , seeing at once that Lowell did not mean to be unkind , said , " Yes , yes ; so I was . " Lowell happened to know that Wykoff had been in prison ; indeed , Wykoff had told all about it in an autobiography , and Lowell was eager to show his knowledge of it . Lowell was quite the youngest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in part the result of several qualities . One of these was goodness , for good men keep their youth longer than men who are not good . He had always led a good life . He was a very honest man and a scrupulously honorable one . He was , I may say in passing , a very kind man , and a man of great charity . He was the least censorious and the least vindictive of men . It was very rare to hear him speak ill of anyhody . If he did criticize , it was done in the gentlest manner . The only person of whom I remember to have heard him speak with any degree of asperity was the Rev. Henry Ward Beecher , and his complaint against him was on the score of refinement . He said that upon one occasion he had been seated next to Beecher at the latter 's particular request . I can understand that Lowell might not have liked him . Beecher was a very powerful person ; quite overwhelming , indeed , and might easily have offended the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charitable of speech and opinion ; he was a man of much practical kindness as well , and was very ready to do anybody a good turn . I may add that there is one kind of charity which an American diplomat abroad has many opportuni ties of exercising . He is often called upon to help his countrymen who are in need of financial assistance , and Lowell did more of this than his limited means justified . One cause of his youthfulness was no doubt physical . He had rugged health and was a man of strong physique . He had that build which is said to be one of the best for strength and endurance ? deep chest and broad shoulders set on short , stout legs . I think you see physical strength in his poetry , in the introduction to " The Vision of Sir Launfal , " for instance . In a happy and hopeful period of time , take a high-minded young poet in the early enthusiasm of natural virtue and with something of the pride of that quality and in first-rate physical condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bobolinks of the sudden , transient , and brilliant spring of Massachusetts , and let him sing , and you may have poetry something like this . You see the same quality in that vital poem " The Courtin ' , " a production which has the true madness and gladness of poetry and humor . It is perhaps the most like Lowell of anything he ever wrote . These two poems bid fair to live as long as our language lives . During the period of my service under him he was in perfect health , although sixty to sixty-five years of age ; he would do things you would scarcely expect of a man of that age . I recall this incident : We had been at one of the balls at Buckingham Palace . The dress in which we had to attend these parties was an ordinary dress-coat and waistcoat , with knee-breeches and silk stockings . On coming away from one of these balls at two or three o'clock in the morning , the carriage was not to be found , and we walked home , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the knee downward but silk stockings and very thin pumps . I felt as if I were standing up to my knees in cold water . Lowell , on the contrary , did not seem to feel the cold in the least , but stepped along in the gayest of spirits . During Mr. Lowell 's term as minister , our government bought the Franklin manuscripts , which were in London . The State Department sent to the Legation the catalogue of the manuscripts with the request that either Mr. Hoppin or I should go to the British Museum , where the manuscripts were stored , and examine them and compare them with the catalogue . 1 accordingly spent three or four hours daily at the Museum for nearly a month , examining the papers . What I had to . do was to see that the government got what they had bought . It was most interesting work , particularly the examination of the papers relating to Franklin 's residence in Paris . Franklin was in daily intercourse with the great characters of that great age of France and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tuesday , " " Monday , " " March 12 , " " June 14 , ' , etc . I found myself keeping his engagement-hook for him . " No , he ca n't dine with Vergennes on Thursday ; he is engaged to Madame d'Houdetot for that day . " I noticed some of the papers were in the form of collars , cuffs , sleeves , etc . On asking why this was , I was told that they were in the possession of a descendant of Franklin , who lived in London in lodgings in St. James Street , and died there . These lodgings were over a taitorshop . The tailor took possession of the manuscripts and threw them on top of a chest , and , when he needed patterns , would have recourse to these papers . After I had made my report on the papers , a day was fixed for their formal transfer to the United States Government . Mr. Lowell thought the occasion sufficiently dignified to go to the Museum in his own carriage , and I went with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very much , but he could have a nice pair of bays and a good brougham , with which he made a rather smart appearance . I remember that drive very well . He was in boyish spirits , talked a great deal and was of course mighty good company . I remember , as I followed him into the room at the Museum in which the papers were kept , the somewhat grandiose expression of his back and shoulders . All there was to do was to see two or three people and to take over a few wooden boxes . It was a symptom of that incorrigible youthfulness and simplicity which were part of his character . Since writing the above paragraph , I have been shown the following postscript to a letter from Lowell to R. W. Gilder , in which Lowell thus relates a supposititious anecdote of himself : ' As Lowell was passing along the Edgeware Road with a friend two years ago , their eyes were attracted by a sign with this inscription , ' Hospital for Incurable Children . ' Turning to his companion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lowell said , quietly , There 's where they 'll send me one of these days . ' " A bit of self-knowledge which is perhaps unusual . I should not omit to say that no one could have been much with Lowell without hearing him talk a great deal about Jews , on which subject he was exceedingly well informed . He believed that a strain of Hebrew blood would dominate all other strains of blood in a man . He saw Jews everywhere . He thought , for instance , that Gladstone was a Jew . I believe , indeed , that Gladstone was of Jewish descent ; his brother , Sir Thomas Gladstone , was extremely Jewish in appearance . Lowell 's discovery of a Jewish descent in people , however , was not so much from an examination of their physiognomy as from their names . Vernon Harcourt he thought a Jew because he was from the Leveson-Gowers , Lord Granville 's family , who were Jews because their name was Leveson . " There 's where Harcourt gets his impudence , " he would say . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when a man I knew passed . I said , " That 's the new Russian secretary , Davidoff ; he succeeds Bartholomai . " Lowell answered , " Davidoff , Bartholomai ? both Jews . " He said that he himself was a Jew because he was descended from people named Russell ? Russell being a Jewish name . He said that I was a Jew because my name means Christmas , though he admitted , grudgingly , " You have n't got the nose for it . " The province of Natal was so named because it was discovered on Christmas day ; the " t " is softened into " d " in Spanish and in the Venetian dialect of Italian . Lowell insisted that my earliest converted ancestor wanted to show how good he was and took the most Christian name he could find . When I reminded him that there was a family of my name who had keen , from father to son , in the Gold Book of Venice since 124o , with their device ? the star of Bethlehem on a blue field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there was further chaff . I should explain that Lowell had no dislike of Jews , but a great interest in them . He had an abundance of curious and amusing information about them . The last few years of Lowell 's life ? those which he spent in this country after leaving London ? were , it appeared to me , sadder than they should have been . In the lives of some men there is toward the end a season like Indian summer ; at any rate , so it is said in novels and romances . I have indeed known men of whom that was true . But it did not seem to come to Lowell . I do n't see why he should not have had it . Until attacked by his last illness , he had been in fairly good health . He was comfortably off , I suppose . He had some private fortune , and he had other sources of income . He told me that his royalties brought him about twelve hundred dollars a year , which was a good deal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essays . He said that he could go back to his profiss-orship whenever he wished , and d &Ras; much work as he liked . His position before the country , moreover , was a most enviable one . From the time of his return from London till his death he was , with the possible exception of Mr. Cleveland , perhaps the most distinguished man in the country . But in spite of these advantages , his last years seemed rather desolate . It is our misfortune here that we have no great capital where every American may feel at home , as an Englishman may in London or a Frenchman in Paris . Of course , an American who lives in his own country must live in some place , and any place here is dull after London or Paris . Lowell returned to London once or twice after his connection with the Legation had ceased , but he was not happy there . A gentleman with whom he stayed after his return told inc that he seemed to feel the loss of his old position . When I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ official position would have been better placed there than anybody else with one , my friend said , " So should I , but that was not his feeling . " I have said that Lowell was the youngest man I ever knew . It is also true that I never knew any other man who had a greater dread of growing old than he . He would sometimes say to me ? I was twenty-five years the younger ? " Oh , you 'll begin to feel it pretty soon . " The last time I saw him he gave me a curious and somewhat pathetic indication of his interest in this subject . I happened to be in Boston for a day , and went out to see him in the teeth of a terrible March blizzard . I thought he seemed rather lonely . He told me that Hoppin had called upon him not lung before . He said that he looked well and seemed to he in good health , but he noticed that when he went out he was a little awkward in getting down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door with me and stood there , evidently waiting to see how I negotiated the front steps . At the age at which I then was , there was no reason why there should be anything the matter with my action . But the incident was characteristic of Lowell , and of his intense interest in the subject of youth and age . Recently in London on a hot Sunday afternoon in September , the city very empty and the air having that deadness which characterizes London hot weather , I turned southward from Albert Gate and found myself in a long parallelogram with a narrow grassplot in the middle , surrounded by an iron fence . I did not know it at first . " What is this ? " I thought . " Why , of course it is Lowndes Square , and over there is Lowell 's house . " The house had the silence which belongs to places we have known well in the past and have ceased to know . The bright and manly figure of the former occupant stood before me in a peculiarly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , admired , respected , and regretted .
