SCENE  --  The edge of the Arizona desert ; a plain dotted in the foreground with clumps of sagebrush . On the horizon a lonely butte is outlined , black and sinister against the lighter darkness of a sky with stars . The time is in the early hours of the night . In the foreground stands a ragged tent the flap of which is open . Leaning against it are some shovels and a pick or two . Two saddles are on the ground nearby . Before the tent is a smouldering camp fire at which an elderly man of about fifty is seated . He is dressed in miner 's costume ; flannel shirt , khaki trousers , high boots etc.  --  all patched and showing evidences of long wear and tear . His wide-brimmed Stetson hat lies on the ground beside him . His hair is turning gray and his face is the face of one who has wandered far , lived hard , seen life in the rough , and is a little weary of it all . Withal his air and speech are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him in spite of many hard knocks . On one side of the tent stands a rough stool and a gold-miner 's panning tub  --  a square box half filled with water . THE OLDER MAN  --  ( stirring the fire in a futile attempt to start it into flame ) I wonder what can be keeping him so long ? ( hears noise of someone approaching ) Hello Jack , I was just beginning to think you were lost . ( Old Pete enter . He is an old man dressed in rough miner 's costume but he wears spurs and carries a quirt in his hand . He is covered with dust and has evidently been riding hard. ) p. 3 OLD PETE  --  It ai nt Jack . It 's me . THE OLDER MAN  --  ( disappointed ) Hello Pete . What brings you around at this time of the night ? OLD PETE  --  ( taking telegram from his pocket ) I was just leaving Lawson when the operator stopped me and give me this for Jack . I seen your camp fire burning and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MAN  --  ( taking telegram ) Many thanks Pete . Wo n't you sit down and rest a bit ? OLD PETE  --  Much obliged but I reckon I 'll travel along . I ai n't slept none to speak of in the past few nights and I got to be up at sunrise . ( grinning sheepishly ) That fool town of Lawson sure does keep you up nights . ( He starts to go , then stops . ) Claim panning out as good as ever ? THE OLDER MAN  --  Better every day . This morning we took a sample from the upper end which we have n't touched so far . It looks good but we have n't panned it yet . OLD PETE  --  You-alls ought to get rich . You know how to keep money . Now me and money never could get on no-way. ( pulls out pockets ruefully ) They cleaned me out in Lawson this time and I reckon they 'll clean me again the next time . ( shaking his head ) Cities is sure hell that-a-way . Adios. ( exits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poor Pete . Same old story . Been bucking the faro bank again I suppose . ( looks at telegram ) Hmm . Wonder what this is ? Jack has had no correspondence in the five years I 've been with him . May be something important in connection with the mine . I guess I 'd better open it . He wo n't mind anyway . ( He opens the telegram and reads aloud ) " I am waiting . Come . " No name signed . It comes from New York too . Well it 's too many for me . I give it up . ( puts telegram in pocket ) Must be that fool operator got mixed up in his names . I would n't like to see Jack obey any summons like that . He 's about all I 've got now and I 'd hate to see him leave just when we 've struck it rich . ( dismissing the subject ) I guess this wire is all a mistake anyway . ( He looks around yawning and his eye lights on the panning tub @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claim is as rich as that we 've been working  --  ( The noise of someone approaching is heard . ) Here he comes now . Welcome wanderer ! Where have you been all this time ? ( Jack enters . He is dressed about the same as the Older Man but is much younger  --  in the early thirties . ) JACK  --  One of the horses slipt his hobbles and I had quite a hunt for him . I finally found him down by the spring wallowing around as if water were the commonest thing in this section of Arizona . Fool beast ! p. 5 THE OLDER MAN  --  ( forgetting all about the telegram ) It 's a strange thing we should run into water out here where the maps say there is n't any . It 's the one blessing we 've found in this land God forgot . We 're fools for luck for once . JACK  --  ( nodding ) Yes . ( then rather exultantly ) But we have small cause to kick about this lonely hole after all . Any place is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it and he finds it . There 's gold here and ( taking a small bag from his pocket and shaking it ) we 've found it . So long live the desert say I. THE OLDER MAN  --  Those are my sentiments . ( He rolls a cigarette paper and setting it afire in the flame lights his pipe . ) It sure looks as if our ship had come in at last here on the rim of the world . The luck was due to change . We 've had our share of the bad variety ; just missing a strike in every jumping-off place from South Africa to Alaska . We 've taken our hard knocks with the imitation of a laugh at any rate and ( stretching out his hand to the younger man who grasps it heartily ) we 've been good pals ever since that day in the Transvaal five years ago when you hauled me out of the river , saved my life , and our friendship began . ( as the younger man starts to speak ) No you need n't try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgotten that day and I never will . p. 6 JACK  --  ( to change the subject ) I 'm going to see what that prospect we took at the other end of the claim looks like . ( He goes into the tent and returns with a gold pan heaped with dirt under his arm and sitting down in front of the panning tub proceeds to test the prospect . He washes the heap of dirt down until there is but a handful of gravel left . The Older Man comes over and stands behind him looking over his shoulder . Finally after one quick flip of the pan Jack points to the sediment left in the bottom in which a small heap of bright yellow particles can be seen . ) What do you think of that ? THE OLDER MAN  --  ( reaching over and feeling them with his fingers ) O' course gold ; just as I expected . The upper end of the claim is just as rich as it is down here . JACK  --  ( with growing excitement ) There 's over a quarter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars a pan  --  better than we 've ever panned down here at any time since we made the strike four months ago . ( lays the pan aside ) I tell you this claim is too much for us to handle alone . One of us ought to go East and organize a company . THE OLDER MAN  --  Then it will have to be you . I 'm too old . ( Jack smiles and makes a deprecating gesture . ) Anyway I never could get along with civilization and ( laughing ) civilization never cared overmuch for me. ( goes over and sits down by the fire )  --  ( after a pause ) You 've seemed to be hankering after the East quite a lot in the last month or so . ( smiling ) Getting tired of the company here eh ? p. 7 JACK  --  ( quickly ) No you know that is n't so after all the years we 've been pals and all we 've been through together . THE OLDER MAN  --  ( jokingly ) Then what is the attraction the effete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman I suppose ? JACK  --  ( with dignity ) An angel rather . THE OLDER MAN  --  ( cynically ) They 're all angels  --  at first . The only trouble is their angelic attributes lack staying qualities . ( then half bitterly ) At any rate you 'd find them hard to prove by my experiences . JACK  --  ( shrugging his shoulders a little impatiently ) You 're a disgusting cynic and I refuse to argue . You know we 've never been able to agree on that subject . I 'm going to hunt out that bottle we 've carried about so long and we 'll drink to the mine and future prosperity . ( He goes into tent . ) Here it is . ( He returns with a quart of whiskey , opens it with a knife and pours out two drinks in the tin cups. ) ( laughing ) I think this is a proper occasion for celebration  --  the two Prodigals welcome the fatted calf . Let 's make it a christening also . Here 's to the Yvette mine ! p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turns suddenly grim . His hand trembles as he clinks cups and he almost spills some of the whiskey . He speaks in harsh jerky tones . ) Why the Yvette ? JACK  --  ( not noticing his agitation ) I know it sounds like rather a frivolous name for a mine but I have a hunch . There 's a romance back of it  --  my romance . That was her name . One rarely speaks of such things . I 've never told you but I will now if you care to hear it . It was over a year before I met you . I had just been out of mining school a short time and was prospecting around in the mountains of Peru hoping to hit a bonanza there . At the time I speak of I had returned to reoutfit at a small mining camp near the frontier of Ecuador . It was there I met her . She was the wife of a broken-down mining engineer from the States , over twenty years her senior . ( The Older Man who has been listening intently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and harsher . ) According to all accounts he was a drunken brute who left her alone most of the time and only lived from one drunk to another . Personally I never saw him . It was probably better that I did not . You see I fell in love with her on the spot and the thought of how he treated her made my blood boil . THE OLDER MAN  --  ( in stifled tones ) What was the name of the mining town you mention ? I 've been in that country myself  --  many years ago . p. 9 JACK  --  San Sebastien . Do you know it ? ( At the words " San Sebastien " the Older Man seems to crumple up . Nothing seems alive about him but his eyes , staring horribly , and his right hand which nervously fingers the gun in the belt around his waist . ) THE OLDER MAN  --  ( in a hoarse whisper ) Yes . I know it . Go on . JACK  --  ( dreamily , absorbed in his own thoughts ) I loved her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed like a lily growing in a field of rank weeds . I longed to take her away from all that atmosphere of sordid sin and suffering ; away from her beast of a husband who was steadily ruining that beautiful young life and driving her to desperation . I over-stayed my time . I should have been back in the mountains . I went to see her often . He was always away it seemed . Finally people began to talk . Then I realized that the time had come and I told her that I loved her . I shall never forget her face . She looked at me with great calm eyes but her lips trembled as she said : " I know you love me and I  --  I love you ; but you must go away and we must never see each other again . I am his wife and I must keep my pledge . " THE OLDER MAN  --  ( starting to his feet and half drawing the pistol from the holster ) You lie ! p. 10 JACK  --  ( rudely awakened from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angry and perplexed ) Why what do you mean ? What is it ? THE OLDER MAN  --  ( controlling his rage with a mighty effort and sitting down again ) Nothing . Nerves I guess . It 's my sore spot  --  the virtue of women . I 've seen but little of it in my mining camp experiences and your heroine seems to me too impossible . ( Wonderingly Jack sits down beside him again . ) JACK  --  ( early ) You would n't think so if you could have seen her . ( The Older Man covers his face in his hands and groans . ) Here 's a picture of her she sent me a year ago . ( takes small photo out of pocket of his shirt ) Look at it . ( handing him the photo ) Do you think a woman with a face like that could be the regular mining camp kind ? ( feels in pocket again and goes into tent as if searching for something ) THE OLDER MAN  --  ( looks at the photo with haggard eyes for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife ! ( Then staring into vacancy he speaks to himself , unconsciously aloud . ) She has not changed . p. 11 JACK  --  ( who has come back from the tent with a soiled envelope in his hand in time to hear the last sentence ) ( astonished ) Changed ? Who ? Do you know her ? THE OLDER MAN  --  ( quickly mastering his emotion and lying bravely ) No . Of course not . But she reminds me of a girl I knew here in the States a long time ago . But the girl I speak of must be an old woman by this time . I forget my grey hairs . JACK  --  Yvette is only twenty-five . Her parents were poor French people . In a fit of mistaken zeal for her welfare they forced her to marry this man when she was too young to know her own mind . They thought they were making an excellent match . Immediately after the marriage he dragged her off to San Sebastien where he was half owner of a small mine . It seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settled there . ( after a pause ) I 'd like to be fair to him . Maybe he realized that she could never love him and was trying to drown the memory of the mistake he had made . He certainly loved her  --  in his fashion . THE OLDER MAN  --  ( in a pathetic whisper ) Yes . He must have loved her  --  in his fashion . JACK  --  ( looking at the letter in his hand which he had forgotten ) Ah , I forgot . I have proof positive of her innocence and noble-mindedness . Here is a letter which she wrote and sent to me the morning I was leaving . It 's only a few words . Read it Mr. Doubting Thomas . ( hands letter to the Older Man ) p. 12 THE OLDER MAN  --  ( His hands tremble. ) ( aside ) Her writing . ( reading aloud ) " I must keep my oath . He needs me and I must stay . To be true to myself I must be true to him . ( aside " My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may send for you . Good-bye " signed Yvette . ( He folds the letter up slowly , puts it back in the envelope and hands it to Jack . Suddenly he turns to him with quick suspicion . ) What does she mean by that last sentence ? JACK  --  When I left I gave her my address in the States and she promised to let me know if she changed her mind or if conditions changed . THE OLDER MAN  --  ( with grim irony ) You mean if the drunken husband died . JACK  --  ( his face growing hard ) Yes . That 's what I mean . THE OLDER MAN  --  Well how do you know he has n't ? Have you ever heard from her since ? JACK  --  Only the one time when she sent the picture I showed you . I received the letter from her in Cape Town a year ago . It had been forwarded from the States . She said her husband had disappeared soon after I left . No one knew where he had gone but the rumor was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , refusing to believe in her innocence . ( grimly patting his gun ) I 'm sorry he did n't find me. p. 13 THE OLDER MAN  --  ( He has by this time regained control of himself and speaks quite calmly . ) Where is she now ? JACK  --  Living with her parents in New York . She wrote to say that she would wait a year longer . If he did not return to her by then she would become legally free of him and would send for me . The year is up today but ( hopelessly ) I have received no word . ( walks back and looks into the darkness as if hoping to see someone coming ) THE OLDER MAN  --  ( suddenly remembers the telegram he has . He takes it from his pocket as if to give it to Jack ; then hesitates and says in agony ) My God I can not ! ( as he realizes the full significance of what the telegram says . Mastered by a contrary impulse he goes to burn it in the camp fire but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camp fire he turns quickly and hands the telegram to him . ) Cheer up ! Here 's a surprise for you . Read this . Old Pete brought it from Lawson before you returned and I forgot all about it . I opened it by mistake thinking it might have something to do with the mine . ( He turns quickly away as if unable to bear the sight of Jack 's elation . ) ( Jack feverishly opens the yellow envelope . His face lights up and he gives an exclamation of joy and rushes to the Older Man. ) p. 14 JACK  --  It 's too good to be true . Tell me I am not dreaming . THE OLDER MAN  --  ( He looks at Jack steadily for a moment , then tries hard to smile and mutters ) Congratulations . ( He is suffering horribly . ) JACK  --  ( misunderstanding the cause of his emotion ) Never mind Old Pal I wo n't be gone long and when I come back I 'll bring her with me . THE OLDER MAN  --  ( hastily ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East for a while . We 'll need someone there when the work really starts . JACK  --  When can I get a train ? THE OLDER MAN  --  If you ride hard and start right away you can get to Lawson in time for the Limited at three in the morning . JACK  --  ( rushing off with saddle under arm ) My horse is hobbled at the mouth of the canyon . THE OLDER MAN  --  ( stands in front of tent ) So I have found him after all these years and I can not even hate him . What tricks Fate plays with us . When he told me his name that first day I noticed that it was the same as the man 's I was looking for . But he seemed such a boy to me and my heart went out to him so strongly that I never for an instant harbored the idea that he could be the John Sloan I was after . Of course he never knew my right name . I wonder what he would say if he knew . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what 's the use ? Why should I mar his happiness ? In this affair I alone am to blame and I must pay . As I listened to his story this evening until no doubt remained that he was the John Sloan I had sworn to kill , my hand reached for my gun and all the old hate flared up in my heart . And then I remembered his face as he looked that day in the Transvaal when he bent over me after saving my life at the risk of his own . I could almost hear his words as he spoke that day when death was so near : " All right , old pal , you 're all right . " Then my hand left my gun and the old hatred died out forever . I could not do it . ( He pauses and a bitter smile comes over his face as at some new thought . ) O what a fool I have been . She was true to me in spite of what I was . God bless him for telling me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only two beings I have ever loved . And I  --  must keep wandering on . I can not be the ghost at their feast . p. 15 JACK  --  ( entering hurriedly , putting on spurs , hat , etc . ) Good-bye Old Pal . I 'm sorry to leave you this way but I have waited so long for this . You understand do n't you ? THE OLDER MAN  --  ( slowly ) Yes . ( grasping his hand and looking deep into his eyes ) Good-bye and God bless you both . JACK  --  ( feelingly ) Good-bye . ( exits ) THE OLDER MAN  --  ( sits down by the camp fire and buries face in his hands . Finally he rouses himself with an effort , stirs the camp fire and smiling with a whimsical sadness softly quotes : )                                            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
