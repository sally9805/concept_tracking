Poetic Education and Slang ATEACHER who II Was humble toward the poetry in his pupils ' hearts might find a way to tell them what verbal poetry is , and all about the technique of its construction , without once opening a book or drawing them away for a moment from the fields of their own pleasure . For not only is the prevailing attitude of the senses poetic in childhood , but children are continually adopting and creating for their enjoyment poetic forms of speech . They surround themselves with an evolving paraphernalia of vivid and unnecessary expressions , by which they reinforce their joy in the strong flavor of life . It happens , however , that the finer discriminations of pleasure-quality which we call " taste , " and " the sense of beauty , " are not developed very early , and therefore this poetry of juvenile conversation is not usually exquisite , or even beautiful . It does not sound like the eloquent rendition of polite lyrics in a drawing-room . It sounds raw . It sounds like Shakespeare having a good time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to God , there is no sin against propriety equal to that of introducing on one 's own account some of Shakespeare 's ways of having a good time . For this reason the rich fruitage of poetry that ripens continually in the playground of the young is never harvested , and the rank color and power of it rarely stains the pages of polite literature . Educators look down upon it as one of the things to be eradicated in preparing a child to take his place in a society whose principal ideal is elegance . But I think we may say without exaggeration that current slang contains more genuine and compelling poetry than current verse . And if there is one place in the world where children 's appreciation of the motives which impel poets to use language as they do might appropriately begin , it is in this virile poetry of their own creation . Just as we distinguish two ways of experiencing or perceiving things ? the way of adjustment and the way of realization ? so we can distinguish two ways of naming things . Things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us what they are for , which classifies them for scientific or everyday purposes , or they may be named with a poetic name , which tells us what they are , what they feel like , which engenders in our sensibility a vivid awareness of their presence . An oriole , to take an extreme instance , may be called ; cirrus galbula , or he may be called fire-bird . And wherever anything is to be identified with words a similar alternative arises . The words may indicate only a handy classification , or they may convey the taste of a quality in experience . It is a custom for literary professors and professors of elegant virtue to tell their pupils that all slang is the result of indolence . We use a slang word , they say , merely because we are too lazy to think up the " correct " word . This casual and sweeping generalization is a result of indolence in these professors . A moment 's studious examination of the subject-matter would show them that even among practical slang words the expressions which fill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that fully half of the practical slang makes a new and valued discrimination in the child 's environment , and that moreover more than half of all slang is not practical at all , but vigorously poetic in its intent , supplying a new creative word for a thing , or a quality , or a mood . The words bluff and crib and flunk , for instance , are entirely practical . They are important items in the technique of school life . Muff and hunch are as ingeniously fitted into the mechanism of social life as any words . They are skilfully formed instruments . Pussyfoot , on the other hand , is a verb of poetic quality . Up-against-it is more subtly so . She 's a gloom , he 's a butter-fingers , a flannel-mouth , have a heart , start something , put your foot in these expressions are all keenly poetic , and they are strong. * Of course , like all poetry that becomes established , they lose after a time their original vigor and come to be used automatically and with stale perception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words , and the very fact that they are continually being changed bears witness to the power and prevalence of the motive which gave rise to them . Professors ought to warn their pupils against using any expressions without discrimination and too habitually . But this is not warning them against slang , it is warning them against deadness . Indeed in the evolutions of baseball slang is to be found a most perfectly magnified example of the lively-minded person 's determination not to use any expression after it has grown habitual . This poetic striving , mingled with a certain exaggerative humor , is what makes our baseball dialect grow more and more unintelligible to a layman. * Professor John Erskine , who teaches Shakespeare at Columbia University , said ( in reviewing my book , " Enjoyment of Poetry " ) that the expression zip it to the fence , used in baseball stories to mean a home-run , is not the result of an impulse to realize . Applying the same old dogma that misguided him when he was a child , he said that such expressions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only of feeling but of thinking . " I never could take this statement seriously , but I quote it here to show that English professors really can be as lazy and unpoetic in generalizing about this matter as I say they are . December 16 , 1916 THE NEW At first we say that the pitcher is nervous . But that is a worn-out expression . His feet are not on the ground ? that too , however , is stale . He 's up in the air . But that again becomes copied . He 's chasing the kite , he 's aeroplaning his emotions , and so on , until some perfectly unintelligible gibberish results , and we go back to the practical adjectives and begin the cycle again . The determination of certain restaurant clerks not to name any dish by its practical name is worthy of any poet 's emulation . " A dozen raw oysters , " orders the customer . " Twelve alive in the shell , " shouts the clerk . " An order of rump steak rare , " says another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Dante has just this manner of indicating the thing by its attendant circumstances . " I am one who left off singing hallelujahs , " is Dante 's way of saying , " I am a messenger from heaven . " For those who are not too refined to think , it must be evident that the technique of vividness here is the same , although the thing to be imagined is of so different a quality . And if the teachers of poetry would once recognize that everyone enjoys vividly realizing whatever he is interested in , and that poetry is the vivid realization through verbal agencies of anything , then they might consent to fall in with their pupils ' own interests , at least for a while , and the whole attitude of childhood towards poetry would be revolutionized . Certainly there is some risk that children will fail to appropriate the wealth of the established language , if they satisfy themselves too continually with these passing forms . But they will never genuinely appropriate any language , if every native impulse to vivid utterance on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indolent or vulgar . The other day I received from the principal of a girls ' boarding-school a list of four hundred slang exclamations which she had gathered among her pupils ; and though they were written down in wholly accidental order , it was impossible not to be reminded by their rhythms , as well as by the startling grammatic and pictorial figures they employed , of Shakespeare 's verse . If you can escape for a moment from the continual burden society puts upon you of proving that you are not vulgar , and if you can elude the even more . common misfortune of being unable to perceive what a thing is when it is familiar ? come freshly and na ? vely to these expressions as you do to those on the lips of Falstaff ? you will not fail to sense this similarity . Kiddo ! Kiddo ! Kiddo ! Come on , you big fat husk ! See if I care ! Dry up ! You poor It ! You crazy wop ! I 've got your number ! Dry up and bust ! Beat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caesar 's ghost ! I could spit ink ! Put that in your pipe and smoke it ! Go chase yourself ! Rave on , Lucy ! Do you get me , kid ? Button up your lip ! Get off the earth ! You Bonehead ! You Poor Boob ! The vigor of these utterances , I think , is what reminds us especially of Shakespeare ; each one is an intellectual surprise , and rhythmically a shot out of a gun . I can not see how any long-lecturing professor , once hearing these expressions ejected through the lips of a child , can have the audacity to call them indolent . They spring straight up from the fountain-source of all poetry ? strong love of the taste of life and impulse to convey that taste in words . fessors will be to remind them that some of Perhaps the best way to prove this to the protheir own worthiest and most classic and respectable words are themselves , if we go back to their origin , just the same slangy vagabonds as these. * Examine , for instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dignified term , fit to be incorporated in a President 's inaugural : " I will not at this time inveigh against the custom prevalent among my contemporaries ? " You can imagine how it would sound . And yetpoetically ? what does that word mean ? in means into . Pehi means to sail . " I will not at this time sail into my contemporaries " I Here is another Latin word ? insult . In its origin it meant to jump on ? exactly what is said everywhere by the school-children of America when the appropriate situation arises . Diatribe is a pretentious term . It implies something more thorough than an insult , a more lasting denunciation . You not only " jump on " somebody , but you " rub it in . " And the Greek verb rphice means to rub . * The word classic itself is a Latin equivalent of the slang word , classy . We used to say of a crazy person that he was " off his trolley . " And the word delirious meant substantially the same thing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Latin words de and lira , which mean of or out of your furrow . The word precocious means precooked , or , as we say , half-baked . Capricious means like a goat , and the slang correlatives here are innumerable . These are some of the parallels that may be drawn between the poetry of new-horn language which young people enjoy as slang , and the poetry of settled language which is reserved for the enjoyment of professors of etymology . Imagine some worthy , refined and graduated soul , being offended by a young upstart , and responding somewhat as follows : " It seems to me you are a trifle capricious . I would hardly expect any one to inveigh against me in this delirious manner , delivering such a diatribe . Is it essential to your precocity to insult your elders ? " And then suppose we translated this somewhat according to the etymological dictionary : " You goat ! You must be off your trolley to sail into me like that and then rub it in ! Just because you 're half-baked you need n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is indeed a long way from the emotions which attend these youthful images to the exaltations of rhapsodic poetry . But the verbal technique of vivid realization is the same all the way . It is the same throughout all conversation and literature , and it can be learned and appreciated in whatever field one 's interests wander . The true poet , moreover , is not altogether alien to any field , for he is characterized by a universal love of being . Just as the child is eager to taste the flavor of what is painful , or shocking , or disgusting , so the poet loves to explore and savor in his imagination every quality of sensation , or emotion , or action , or idea which presents itself to his attention . He drinks the whole universe . And his verbal art does not reside in the naming of any particular kinds of things , nor in any elegant delicacy in the naming ; it resides in discovering and applying to every thing the words that bring into focus its naively perceived nature . Poetry is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profanity and vituperation as truly and luxuriantly as in the sublimest ranges of the spirit 's aspiration . It is the art of staying awake all the time , of preserving , throughout the ravaging humdrum of business and custom and decorum , a spirit fresh and all alive to the world . Surely our education in this art ought not to put us to sleep .
