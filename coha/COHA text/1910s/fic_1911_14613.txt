THE entrance from the hallway is at the back in right ; the varnished door holds a heavy chain which , at rise of curtain , is fastened across . Upon the back wall there are many small pictures and photographs ; beneath them a long box-couch with a green covering . At the left , a double curtain drawn hides further rooms beyond . At the right , a bureau and some bookcases fill the space between the door and the window which opens out upon the fire-escape . There is a writing table in the center with chairs about . The room suggests the abode of a woman supporting herself , with its certain air of unspecified use coupled with touches purely feminine . There are some indications , however , that its owner is not without connections and sympathies more aristocratic than her present surroundings would imply . The stage is empty for a while , then a bell is heard off . The noise of some one behind the curtains is suggested evidently rising to open the downstairs front door . After a short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . EDITH SHERWOOD enters from the other room , and crosses , after portraying a sense of the importance of what is to happen . She is dressed in a neat , simple , closely fitting gingham gown which may have been made by herself . She is tall , well-lined , robust , and vibrant . There is authority and self-reliance in her personality , and the beautiful Greek regularity of her face does not entirely conceal its warmth and health . At present , though , there are traces of long vigil and mental suffering . She removes the chain , opens the door to discover Mrs. OLIVER WILLIAMS standing outside , her hands half folded before her as though having waited in patience . Mrs. WILLIAMS is middle-aged , her hair turning gray , her face pinched and bloodless . There is little indication of any vitality save in her restless eyes : her manner is calm though not without conveying some studied intention throughout . She uses few gestures , and speaks almost without emotion in an even monotone , yet with a subtle strength in spite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gowned , and her appearance at first would be always inconspicuous . She holds a letter in her hand to which she refers and then replaces in her handbag . MISS SHERWOOD is slightly embarrassed . MRS . OLIVER WILLIAMS Is this Miss Sherwood ? Edith Sherwood ? p. 3 EDITH SHERWOOD Yes . MRS . OLIVER WILLIAMS I am Oliver Williams ' wife . EDITH SHERWOOD Oh , to be sure . I  --  I did n't mean you should take all this trouble , Mrs. Williams . MRS . OLIVER WILLIAMS I thought we could talk better . My husband might have come in at home . You were not expecting him here , though , were you ? EDITH SHERWOOD No , not now . MRS . OLIVER WILLIAMS That would have been a pity , would n't it ? EDITH SHERWOOD Do come in . MRS . OLIVER WILLIAMS Thanks . ( Mrs. WILLIAMS comes in almost diffidently as MISS SHERWOOD , deeply moved and trying to gather herself together , slowly crosses the door , and mechanically fastens the chain . ) EDITH SHERWOOD Wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( She goes to a chair . ) You wrote wanted to talk to me . EDITH SHERWOOD Yes , yes , but  --  MRS . OLIVER WILLIAMS I suppose it 's about my husband . EDITH SHERWOOD Yes , Mrs. Williams , it is  --  but  --  p. 4 MRS . OLIVER WILLIAMS ( Calmly ) Well ? EDITH SHERWOOD ( With a little nervous laugh ) I knew exactly what I expected to say  --  but  --  but you 're not like I thought . MRS . OLIVER WILLIAMS Then you 've never seen me with him ? ( MISS SHERWOOD shakes her head slowly . ) We go out very little together : he has other places where he  --  EDITH SHERWOOD ( Interrupting ) Yes ; that 's what I want to talk of , Mrs. Williams  --  about myself and him . MRS . OLIVER WILLIAMS I thought so ; it was kind of you to write  --  first . EDITH SHERWOOD ( Temporizing ) Perhaps there was a little curiosity , too . MRS . OLIVER WILLIAMS To see what Oliver Williams ' wife was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't it ? And please you , too ! ( MISS SHERWOOD conventionally protests . ) Oh , people never look at me when I pass . I know . But I was n't always parched and sapless : once I was like you  --  and not so many years ago  --  like you , red and strong  --  but never so handsome  --  no ; yet inside I was alive and beautiful . That 's just as good , is n't it ? p. 5 EDITH SHERWOOD To be sure  --  to be sure . MRS . OLIVER WILLIAMS ( Eying her ) Well , now that you see I 'm not much of a rival ( MISS SHERWOOD turns abruptly toward her : they face each other )  --  suppose you tell me what you were going to . EDITH SHERWOOD It 's harder than I thought . But I felt I simply had to do it . He 's not aware I wrote you , is he ? MRS . OLIVER WILLIAMS I tell him nothing . EDITH SHERWOOD I 'm glad , though it seems somehow disloyal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't love him . ( Mrs. WILLIAMS starts slightly . ) Oh , you do n't , do you ? Oh , give me the truth and I 'll explain . MRS . OLIVER WILLIAMS ( After a moment 's deliberation as though calmly trying to measure the other woman ) Why should that concern you and him ? EDITH SHERWOOD Oh , it does , it does . I must know that before I speak further . I must . I must . Do you love him ? MRS . OLIVER WILLIAMS No . ( MISS SHERWOOD breathes easier , though the other scrutinizes her closely . ) But I watch him all the time in silence . I wonder if he feels my eyes on him . That 's how I knew there was somebody else , knew it was you . p. 6 EDITH SHERWOOD ( Slightly surprised ) He has spoken of me ? MRS . OLIVER WILLIAMS Once or twice , before he realized you were going to mean something to him . He 's been silent lately . People are so careless while they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EDITH SHERWOOD ( Indignantly ) Mrs. Williams , I 'm a good woman . I 'm straight . MRS . OLIVER WILLIAMS ( Slowly , as though satisfied ) Yes , I believe you . I wanted to be sure . Now there can be truth between us . EDITH SHERWOOD I intend to keep everything honest  --  honest or nothing MRS . OLIVER WILLIAMS How can I help you ? I 'm only his wife  --  Oliver Williams ' wife . ( Faintly smiling ) I wonder if you know what that means ? EDITH SHERWOOD I had my idea of what she would  --  should be like , but I ca n't make you out ; you 're different . MRS . OLIVER WILLIAMS I 'm not the woman he married : I 'm made over . He has changed , too , in fifteen years . Things are different in the spring . You feel you 're more his sort , eh ? p. 7 EDITH SHERWOOD He thinks so . MRS . OLIVER WILLIAMS Do you ? EDITH SHERWOOD He loves me . MRS . OLIVER WILLIAMS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him again ! ( After a pause ) Well , now that I 've seen you , there 's nothing surprising about that . And you ? EDITH SHERWOOD I care , too . I do n't bow my head when I say it . I love him . MRS . OLIVER WILLIAMS It 's in your eyes . EDITH SHERWOOD But I made up my mind he should n't look deep into them and see for himself till I was first sure you did n't love him . MRS . OLIVER WILLIAMS And now that you are sure ? EDITH SHERWOOD I can ask you , as I intended , without compunction , let us have our happiness . MRS . OLIVER WILLIAMS To marry you ? EDITH SHERWOOD Yes , of course that . MRS . OLIVER WILLIAMS Give him up ? Entirely ? EDITH SHERWOOD Yes . MRS . OLIVER WILLIAMS ( As though recalling ) How strange ! p. 8 EDITH SHERWOOD  --  in my seeking you , his wife , in this unusual , open way ? MRS . OLIVER WILLIAMS No ; I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fault in loving , understand me : so I give no excuse , but I must make an explanation . I sat here many nights puzzling over what was best , for I knew by doing the bravest thing I could keep my love most clean . When I first met him I did n't know he was married : no one of his many friends ever spoke of you . Oh , I did n't mean  --  Forgive me . ( Mrs. WILLIAMS motions her to continue . ) But I was n't on my guard , and then , as you said , it was all so unconscious and beautiful . Yet I soon sensed his interest : we women are never surprised when men love us , are we ? We sort of take it for granted . ( Enthusiastically ) But he was so unusual  --  such a wonderful , masterful man ! MRS . OLIVER WILLIAMS Yes ; masterful . EDITH SHERWOOD And I was flattered . I confess it ; why should n't I be  --  to have Oliver Williams pause and look ! Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been because he knew I was straight , and his feeling was the right kind . He saw it pained me , shocked me . From that moment I was a divided self . I 'm anxious you should see how everything was . I tried to draw away gradually , but that only led him on . Then , when I was about to go for good , to give up my little work here  --  for I felt I could n't escape him when he talked ( Mrs. WILLIAMS smiles knowingly )  --  he told me you did n't love him . Then , Mrs. Williams , I stayed deliberately , because I owed something to the thing I knew by now I felt . I wanted to share in his mastery , his career  --  before all . So I saw there could be no compromise in secrecy . ( She is silent a few moments. ) p. 9 MRS . OLIVER WILLIAMS Love dies of its own breath with the windows closed . EDITH SHERWOOD That 's why I struggled to find what was right ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a problem writhing in my brain as well  --  and that is n't good for love . I could n't have stood my burning mind much more , if he had n't finally said that  --  that , with you , there was another , too . MRS . OLIVER WILLIAMS ( Visibly moved for the first time ) Was ? EDITH SHERWOOD And had been . MRS . OLIVER WILLIAMS ( Poignantly ) He told you that ? EDITH SHERWOOD Yes . MRS . OLIVER WILLIAMS To bribe you he told you that ! ! Oh ! ( She bows her head in a long silence . ) EDITH SHERWOOD ( Somewhat at a loss ) I did n't mean to walk in on anything sacred or intimate . It 's yours and only mine so far as it might help us to some solution . But we must be naked , Mrs. Williams , in moments like these . Perhaps he thought it would be so much easier for us all if I knew . It did seem so to me  --  if only you and I quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 MRS . OLIVER WILLIAMS ( Slowly ) It does seem simple-like on the surface , does n't it ? ( She lifts her head and speaks very deliberately . ) But you ca n't have him , do you hear me ? You ca n't have him ! EDITH SHERWOOD ( Impetuously ) What 's to prevent him if I say  --  MRS . OLIVER WILLIAMS Not these frail arms of mine . No . They could n't keep Oliver Williams from having his own way . He 'd brush them aside and crush them like those who oppose him out in the world . But you alone can stop him  --  and you will . EDITH SHERWOOD Step in the way of my own happiness ? MRS . OLIVER WILLIAMS Are you so sure it would be happiness ? EDITH SHERWOOD Yes ; it 's everything . I ca n't do without him ; I 've tried to think of it : it 's terrible . I know now why one commits crimes . I feel sometimes as though I could  --  oh , no , no . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love each other , why should n't he be mine ? Did I come and steal him ? Was n't love dead between you before I came ? Why should n't I have him ? Is marriage for you a knot tied in Heaven to whip and bruise those others who come within its swing ? Why should those dry ideals of wifehood stand in the way of throbbing lives ? Mine and perhaps the man you love . Why ? p. 11 MRS . OLIVER WILLIAMS ( Calmly ) Do you believe it 's that which stands in your way ? Listen : if you and he had gone away together I think I would respect you almost as much as I do your coming to me now . You should have done what I had n't the strength to do and I would have understood . But you did n't ; so I treat you differently . Do n't think it 's my pride , my duty , or my religion that will keep me firm against you . No . No . I wish I had those excuses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OLIVER WILLIAMS No , it 's my absolute helplessness now . You ca n't have him , because I need him . EDITH SHERWOOD I need him , too . He needs me . MRS . OLIVER WILLIAMS Oliver Williams needs you ! EDITH SHERWOOD Yes , I can help him to achieve . MRS . OLIVER WILLIAMS You ! ( She smiles ; then shakes her head . ) You ca n't have him . He 's my habit of life ; I 'm too settled to change . EDITH SHERWOOD ( Leaning closer to her ) Even to go to the other one ? MRS . OLIVER WILLIAMS ( With a touch of indignation ) After a dozen years , go to him ? What ! Take to him , because of an opportunity , this sapless body ! Give this that belongs to the husband , to the man who loved me when I was like you ! No ! No ! The memory of the thing he loved is better for him to keep now ; that still warms the coldness . This I am to-day would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Yet you have starved him all these years . MRS . OLIVER WILLIAMS ( Quickly ) Not by taking from him something he had . EDITH SHERWOOD Yet perhaps he still hungers . MRS . OLIVER WILLIAMS You ca n't tempt me with that . The taste would destroy the need ; now , for him it 's an inspiration , a dream unpossessed . He is becoming something and I know it 's through me . ( Recalling ) He never married . He sends me presents , without a word , on the anniversaries  --  as if I needed reminders . But he gets no answer , expects nothing , for he never thought I cared . EDITH SHERWOOD Never ? MRS . OLIVER WILLIAMS If he had once seen my love I should have gone to him then . I would n't have let him suffer the other way  --  or I would have  --  ( she recoils slightly )  --  I nearly did it as it was ! Instead , instead I told my husband first , as you have told me first ; opened my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why you ca n't have my husband , for he did n't let me go : he kept me  --  kept me . EDITH SHERWOOD He loved you at the time . p. 13 MRS . OLIVER WILLIAMS He would n't let another have the thing he owned ! He called it love , but words are only masks and we all use many words . Yet stunned , bewildered , perhaps flattered , too , that I should be worth fighting to keep , I weakly submitted to his first wishes . EDITH SHERWOOD ( Struggling against the irony she begins to see ) It 's small , petty revenge you 're taking ; you 're making him and me pay for your own weakness . MRS . OLIVER WILLIAMS No ; life 's simply paying you both back for the weakness he made ! It was strength that made me go to him first  --  strength . I 've never known it since . There was something being born at that moment , a soul , a character , and he smothered it . It wanted to live . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight very much ; it had n't learned how . It died easily ; he closed the windows about it . EDITH SHERWOOD ( Impressed in spite of herself by the other 's manner , she shudders and is silent for a while . ) Mrs. Williams , you are speaking of the man I love . You are saying dreadful words . To plant in me doubts alone would be cruel . Do n't you realize , I 'm trying to be a decent woman , fair to you ? But you must be fair to me : he is mine , remember , while I care  --  mine here in me . You must let me understand what you mean . p. 14 MRS . OLIVER WILLIAMS Yes . We must be naked , you said : it chills , but I think you 're worth telling it to ; for it will save you from him . EDITH SHERWOOD ( Loyally ) You ca n't strip him . He 's too wonderful to me . You must n't try . MRS . OLIVER WILLIAMS Too bad he should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) I am waiting to be made sure that he must . MRS . OLIVER WILLIAMS ( Her voice gradually warms in color as she speaks ) Then look at me when I have finished telling you . Blame me , if you will ; I do myself , though it does n't seem to alter consequences . But remember , it was that he could do it , that he could rip me from the roots , take me away to isolation ; a lonely island in the Lakes where things were barren and the sands dry and burning and I had only him before me day and night . Then to strip me of all the garments I had worn , to put on the harness of daily service to his man 's needs , to do things I never had done before , to fetch and carry at his will . And you ask , why , why did I ? Because he talked to me the way you know he has ; he made me believe he was doing it for my good . And I kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  him who could n't keep my love  --  and that he might also see I was wiping out the fault . But he had other reasons than to clear myself in his sight ; he was doing something else deliberately all the time , methodically , carefully , studiously . But I did n't see it at first  --  pain dulled me too much to look outside . I only knew in the loneliness the days were growing longer after a while , and when I faltered , he came to me kindly and helped me with his own hands to fetch and carry . And all the days grew longer and he helped me more and more . And then I began to ask his help and he smiled . I knew why later . He gave it gladly . And then one day I was ill and I let him wait on me without the asking . From that moment I was lost  --  lost . Oh , I see every step of it now . If only the hand of him I loved could have touched me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel it and I was too numb and I was living in a fog . Then things lifted slowly as fogs do , and I saw what my husband was accomplishing . I began to watch to be sure I was right . That 's where I began to watch . I was right . I saw through his heart . I put tests : he always met them , did as I expected . It fascinated me to watch , as though I saw the gallows being built  --  interested me , eased the pain somehow , too . He was devoting himself to accomplish one end  --  with all his absorbing power , one end : to make himself necessary to me ; to make me see I was his dependent thing . p. 15 EDITH SHERWOOD ( Enthusiastically ) That was strength ! Wonderful strength ! If he had done that to me I should have loved him for it ! MRS . OLIVER WILLIAMS It would n't have hurt you . You 're that sort of woman ; made to live with steel . That 's maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You would have been his slave ! EDITH SHERWOOD Yes , to my glory ! MRS . OLIVER WILLIAMS And you could n't have left him ? EDITH SHERWOOD No ! MRS . OLIVER WILLIAMS Neither could I  --  neither can I ; but for a different reason . Do you think him so heartless to have kept it always like that ? Oh , no ; he knew his methods well . He came to me one day and told me I could go if I desired  --  leave him . He wanted me to credit his generosity , to bind me closer , to make me believe I was staying of my own free will  --  that strongest bond of all . He did n't know I saw through him and that I did n't dare wound his pride further by showing him I knew . But each time I tried to break I felt bound more and more by the sense of my own helplessness , my own limitations which he had planned to make me realize . Before , sheer love without thought and self doubt could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  now I doubted myself . And in that doubt I found my own unworthiness . I could n't take that to the other . I could n't , but my husband did not know I could n't . That 's why I stayed . That 's why I saw only too willingly the many obstacles for leaving him he used to throw in my way  --  finding eager excuses within myself for the crime against my love  --  ; that 's why more and more I slipped back , back upon that helplessness which at least obtained service from him . And as I took it more and more greedily , with the years I lost more and more the red blood of life , and , for sheer self-protection , I began , in turn , to bind him to me more and more by that helplessness until there was nothing of my own strength left  --  only the rut habit dragged me through , the rut I have never been able to escape from all these years . And that 's why you ca n't have him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've no strength to be alone . He 's my habit of life . I 'd be lost without him . I ca n't do things by myself . I 'm helpless  --  dependent . I 'm his . He tied me to him , bound me : I 'm round his neck : he must drag me on . You ca n't , with your love , untie that knot ; I ca n't . He tied it . He has got to keep the thing he made . I 'm his . He 's mine  --  mine  --  to the end ! ( There is a long pause . MISS SHERWOOD has bowed her head , completely overcome . Mrs. WILLIAMS , however , soon gains control of herself , covertly looks toward the other , and waits . They resume very quietly. ) p. 16 EDITH SHERWOOD If it only had been love I could forgive him . MRS . OLIVER WILLIAMS So could I  --  a little  --  but not myself . EDITH SHERWOOD It was n't honest of him to tell me of the other one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other deeper into my life . I did not know he realized it . That 's something to have learned . EDITH SHERWOOD ( Bitterly ) To bribe me ! It was n't honest ! MRS . OLIVER WILLIAMS ( Following up her advantage ) He 's not honest , I tell you . He has a way of stalking up and down , making you believe him in spite of yourself because his pride is in it . It 's his power . I gave him that power . EDITH SHERWOOD You ! MRS . OLIVER WILLIAMS Yes . I watched it come into birth there on the lonely island . Do n't you see his own strength was on trial ? He could n't afford to fail . So , through conquering me , a frail woman , he found the way out there to conquer in the world . EDITH SHERWOOD I wonder if he knows that ? MRS . OLIVER WILLIAMS ( Shaking her head and smiling faintly ) That 's my secret and why I sometimes smile . So you can teach him nothing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him something greater than you ! MRS . OLIVER WILLIAMS You 'd be like the others . ( MISS SHERWOOD looks up slowly . ) I can tell you . There have been others . He will remember you , for he forgets when once he has . EDITH SHERWOOD That strips everything . MRS . OLIVER WILLIAMS ( Calmly ) I must fight for what is mine . I watch him : I always know when they come . I take them away from him one by one : there 's a way . You are better than the others : I 've given you the truth . ( There is silence , then she rises . ) And if he should come here  --  and talk ? EDITH SHERWOOD ( Looking up ) I 'd see you clinging to his arm . MRS . OLIVER WILLIAMS ( Relieved ) Then go away . Do n't wait or hope for me . Dead trees stand long . What good you 've brought each other through the feeling will remain . ( Smiling grimly ) I do n't mind that since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go . Everything is over . MRS . OLIVER WILLIAMS Good-by. p. 18 EDITH SHERWOOD If only he valued you . MRS . OLIVER WILLIAMS ( Smiling enigmatically ) I do n't want him to : that would make it harder for me and him . EDITH SHERWOOD I see . ( She buries her head in her arms . ) MRS . OLIVER WILLIAMS ( After some hesitation ) I feel for you with what there is left in me . Memory just now made me live and suffer for a moment . It will be with you , too , a long while . Then some morning you will awake without his name on your lips ; that will cut deepest when you think of it , for it seems disloyal to forget . But that also will pass and you 'll find new reasons besides the ones I 've shown for doing what you must do . I know : we all fool ourselves so to make things easier . Good-by . EDITH SHERWOOD Good-by . MRS . OLIVER WILLIAMS ( At the door ) If he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SHERWOOD He would have been free and I might have  --  MRS . OLIVER WILLIAMS Strange how life works out . EDITH SHERWOOD ( Yearning ) I might have  --  p. 19 MRS . OLIVER WILLIAMS Who knows ? He might have been different if he had n't conquered me . EDITH SHERWOOD I must suffer for it . MRS . OLIVER WILLIAMS The best thing he has loved , too . Strange ! ( As Mrs. WILLIAMS is about to go out of the door which she has opened a sudden idea strikes MISS SHERWOOD . She rises and faces Mrs. WILLIAMS . ) EDITH SHERWOOD Mrs. Williams , did you tell the truth ? Did you tell everything ? Do you still love  --  ? ( She halts helplessly at the other 's silence . ) What difference would it make , anyway ? It 's over . Oh ! !  --  ( She comes slowly down and sits upon the chair again , her hands clasped before her . ) Yet it was masterful ! ! ( She seems to glow at the thought , but Mrs. WILLIAMS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door after her. )
