txt Proposed Automobile Taxes . It has been suggested that a tax of 50 cents for each horse power of the engine be imposed on automobiles by the Federal Government . If this tax is Imposed the car owner will be compelled to pay no leas than three direct taxes on one article : ( 1 ) The registration fee , which in New Jersey is $15 for 30 H. P. cars and over ; ( 2 ) the tax on personal property ; ( 3 ) the horse-power tax . If a tax of 1 cent a gallon Is imposed on gasoline . that will be a fourth tax on the car owner , while the $4 license fee to drive cars of 30 H. P. and over is practically a fifth tax . On a 30 H. P. car that might work out as follows : ( 1 ) $15 annual registration fee ; ( 2 ) appraising the car at $600 , with a tax rate of 82 per hundred on personal property , $12 ; ( 3 ) Federal horse-power tax of 50 cents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for driver 's license for 39 H. P. and over : total , $46 In fees for the privilege of owning and driving a SO H. P. car . Add to that 1 cent a gallon for gasoline and other expenses . On a 22 H. P. car ( appraising It at $200 ) the taxes per annum would be about $25.613 . Is It fair to impose three direct taxes on one article . not to speak of two indirect taxes ? I maintain that that would be unjust discrimination .
