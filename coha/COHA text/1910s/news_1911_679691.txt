txt Thomas 0 . Sopwith , the English avian tor , and Lee Hammond , another airman who was a passenger in Sopwith 's Wright biplane , . fell into the sea yesterday afternoon directly in front of the Brighton Beach Music Hall , in full view of thousands of bathers and spectators on the shore and in motor boats . Neither man was seriously hurt , and the machine , which was dragged ashore , was not damaged beyond repair . The flight in which the accident occurred was one of a number made during the afternoon at the old Brighton Beach race track . It was at 3 o'clock that Sopwith and Hammond went up . After circling the track a few times Sopwith headed out to sea , passing over the heads of those in the surf and steering in a southerly direction along the beach . Opposite the Manhattan Beach Hotel he made a wide turn and started back . Just at the end of the turn his engine began missing fire . He attempted to plane to the beach on an angle that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a safe landing Place . He was only 100 feet up at the start , and as he glided down he came too near the water . A wave caught the wing of his aeroplane and drew the machine down . Hammond tried to jump , but both men were caught under the machine . They managed to extricate themselves , while the crowds shouted and the motor boats crowded around . Lifeboats also put out from the shore as the two aviators supported themselves by grasping the biplane . Their weight pulled it further down in the water , and they let go and started to swim ashore . By this time the motor boat Evelyn was close at band . She picked Sopwith up first and then took Hammond aboard . Hammond was exhausted , but as soon ae he reached shore the life savers went to work on him and soon brought him around . Sopwlth remained on the motorboat t ) see that his biplane was brought ashore . It was taken in tow by the Evelyn and several other boats and dragged into shallow water , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liftedupon a raft . Once this had been accomplished , Sopwith explained how the accident had happened . " I was making the turn to get back to the starting point , " he said , " when I noticed that my engine was missing fire . I then decided to try to make the beach , but the plane dipped a bit too low . After the first bound from the water , Hammond jumped , and almost immediately afterward one of the planes struck the water , overturning the machine . " We were under the surface , and I thought that we were gone , as we were enveloped by the machine , and for a seeming eternity the planes held us there . I managed to get free , and after looking around for Hammond , saw him ' on the other side . " When I saw that Hammond was all right , I then gave thought to the machine . It was sinking , and after trying to buoy it up , I found it impossible . Thereupon we started for shore , swimming as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in time , and Hammond admitted that he was all in . I am very much pleased that the machine was saved , but it is very much on the bad side , as far as its use is concerned , and will be until it gets a thorough overhauling . " Claude Grahame-White also came to grief during the afternoon , and his machine was badly smashed . Just before Sopwith and Hammond began their flight Grahame-White started on a. trip that took him in a long curve around Coney Island Point and out over the Narrows , where the liner George Washington was just steaming in . Many thought GrahameWhite was off for his intended flight around the Statue of Liberty , but instead of going on at this time he swung around over the liner and returned to his starting place just after Sopwith and Hammond fell into the sea . An hour later Grahame-White began another flight . Starting from the midfield near the old paddock , he drove Ms machine across the field . The ground is somewhat uneven , and for a hundred yards the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a soft spot in the centre of the field and stuck there . The sudden stop threw the aviator forward as though shot from a catapult , and broke off the powerful blade in front of the machine . Aside from this the left wing was wrenched completely off , leaving the machine almost a complete wreck . Tilted at an angle of forty-five degrees , the machine was driven into the slough so deeply that it required some digging to get it out , which was eventually accomplished , and the machine brought back to the improvised hangars . White , an unusually careful handler of machines of any type , admitted that he was at a loss to know why the machine had failed to leave the ground when he had tilted the planes . He confessed to receiving an awful jam against the front of the machine When it struck , but aside from that he escaped unhurt . During this time the Sopwith machine was being brought back to the hangars piecemeal . The mechanicians confessed that a would take some repairing-to get . it in shape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever when they got through With it . George W. Beatty , in an attempt to scurry up the track , managed to put his machine out of commission by jamming it into ' the outside fence just above the old judges ' stand . The upper left plane was put out of business . Harry N. Atwood was another of the fliers who went through various evolutions during the afternoon . Eugene B , Ely performed some , daring evolutions . Four times during the afternoon he made e flights . Once he planed from a height of 700 feet to 100 feet . coming down at ' what- looked like a mile a. minute speed , only- to swoop up at . the danger point , and rise gracefully again .
