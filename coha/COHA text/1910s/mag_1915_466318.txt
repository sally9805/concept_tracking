? MNTIL the advent of - telegraphy the most dependable quick bearer of news was the now almost unnoticed bird , the homing - pigeon . Few of us realize the vast influence this bird exercised in irs day over the destinies of nations . Historical references show that the pigeon was known and used in very ancient times ( ioo B.c . ) . Even as early as A.D. rzoo the " pigeon post " had become a well-established institution over Persia , Servia , and Egypt . The cotes were owned by the government , and attached to each cote was an official post-office and postmaster . Probably the use of these birds in times of war , and especially in besieged fortresses , is best known . So important was their function in this respect that until 1850 almost every army post and fort had its cote and was supplied with pigeons from other military stations . Indeed , the French army extended the use of the homing pigeon to the field by equipping the cotes with wheels ( traveling-rotes ) and training the birds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ location . The French navy established cotes on board war-vessels , but the experiment was given up , largely because the pigeon does not home well over water from distances greater than two hundred miles . The commercial value of the pigeon post has been very great indeed . Practically ali of the boards of trade in the large cities of Europe were supplied with these pigeons . Their use in obtaining advance information concerning crops , local insurrections , rumors of war , etc. , can hardly be overestimated . Newspapers likewise were supplied with pigeon posts . After the introduction of the microscope and photography very long messagescould be sent . The material was written out and then micro-photographed . Some fifty thousand words could be sent in one despatch , and the total weight of the paper and the carrying-quill was less than 0.5 gram . The recipient of the despatch could read it with an ordinary low-power microscope . Although the telegraph and the telephone have robbed the homing-pigeon of his utilitarian value , the mystery of how he effects a return over mountain and valley , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibly as unsolved today as it was in the twelfth century , when his commercial value was highest . During the last few years many experiments have been tried which have had for their purpose the unraveling of the difficult and delicate problems connected with homing . In a previous number of Harper 's ( October , 1909 ) I gave a brief sketch of some work 1 had been doing on homing in Dry Tortugas , Florida , under the auspices of the Marine Biological Laboratory of the Carnegie Institution of Washington . The Dry Tortugas group of islands lies well out in the Gulf of Mexico , some seventy-eight miles due west of Key West , about four hundred miles south of Mobile , and nine hundred miles east of Galveston . To Bird Key , one of the tiny islands composing this group , a vast colony of noddy and sooty terns comes annually for its nesting season . These birds are quite similar to the gulls which one sees in almost every harbor . On account of its insular position Bird . Key is wonderfully suited for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been continued by Dr. K. S. Lashley and the writer . We have been primarily engaged in testing to what extent the visual-landmark theory " will account for the facts of homing . It may be mentioned that there are many theories of horning , such as the magnetic theory of Than-ales ; the contrepied ( " back-tracking " ) theory of Reynaud , and the inherited memory theory of Kingsley , as well as a host of others ; but to all of them , with the exception of the visual-landmark theory , there are fatal objections . The visual-landmark theory , on the other hand , has been widely accepted and is today the prevailing one . Possibly the best way to give a clear understanding of both the good and the bad points of this theory is to consider it in connection with certain experiments which are now going on . In all of the work on homing a distinction is made between what is called proximate orientation and distant orientation . Proximate orientation refers to the method the animal uses to get back to the goal ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cote , etc. ) when the goal itself , or objects in its immediate neighborhood , lie within the range of vision or of some other sense organ . This on first sight might seem not to involve any problem of return . It does not in the case of a homing-pigeon which lives in a large and visually prominent cote , hur if we consider other birds the problem presents difficulties . In the case of the sooty tern , one of the species of tropical birds nesting in Tortugas , proximate orientation is a lifeand-death matter . These birds dig a small round hole in the sand which they use as a nest . These holes are dug usually in the open stretches of the island . The nesting-areas are greatly congested ? one nest lying often less than ten inches from its neighbor . During the nesting season the birds arc quarrelsome and guard the small areas around their nests jealously . A given bird , having gone out for food , must , on its return , pick out its own nest from a thousand others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost impossible task , yet the birds do it with extreme accuracy and with great rapidity . At first sight there seem to be no guiding signs or landmarks which can aid the birds . In my preliminary study I was not able to find out how the birds accomplished it . I found that I could dig the nest up and then remake it without disturbing thebird . Yet if I obliterated the old nest and made another only a few inches to the right or left of the old one , the bird invariably went back to the original nest-site , and only by degrees learned to take the nest in its new position . Recently Dr. Lashley has made a thorough study of this problem . He finds that the birds do not necessarily use the objects immediately around the nest in proximate orientation . When the birds fly in from the sea they direct their flight by the more prominent features of the island , such as the buildings , prominent bushes , etc This leads them to the general area in which the nest is situated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the rest of the journey is made partly through using certain small , inconspicuous visual objects as guides , and partly through the use of the muscular sense . Thus in a crowded locality where vision could only lead it astray the bird relies upon the muscular sense somewhat as does the blind man , or as the normal man does in passing through a familiar room in the dark . These experiments of Lashley 's seem to show that in short flights the birds do not need any mysterious " sixth sense " to guide them . Vision , aided by the muscular sense , will account for the facts . Yet it may he asked what hearing such experiments have upon the more distant flights upon the factors in-volved in distant orientation . The bearing is very close indeed . Many investigators argue that since the birds can form habits of reacting to the nest itself , to proximate landmarks , etc. , and can be guided back in this way from short flights , the same process , elaborated , will account for the longer flights , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he gathered from this that there is in the minds of many a serious doubt as to whether there is any such thing as true distant orientation . The adherents of the visual-landmark theory maintain that the method of training the pigeons for long flights finally gives the bird as great familiarity with the whole country as the ordinary animal has with the surroundings of its home ; hence , that when a bird is trained and then sent one thousand miles away , on release it makes for the first familiar landmark , say a mountain-peak one hundred miles away . Arriving there , without breaking the flight , it goes toward the next landmark , say a large city . By following back these landmarks it finally arrives in a neighborhood where it can see the cote . To one familiar only with the flights of the homing-pigeons this theory seems eminently sane and reasonable on first sight ; more thorough examination of the flights of the homing-pigeon , however , leads us into difficulties . We are led into still deeper waters when we consider homing and migration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the present world-record flights of homers and at the way in which such birds are trained . In 1901 the world record for time and distance in the case of the pigeon was one thousand miles in about nine days . Since that time the fanciers in Fort Wayne , Indiana , have obtained some startling records . The present world champion is Bullet D-1872 , owned by Mr. 0 . W. Anderson of the above city . The bird was hatched in 1909 . When four and a half months of age , training was begun . She was taken first two , then five , eight , fifteen , twenty-five , forty , andthen seventy-five miles away and allowed to return . ( This training was distributed , of course , over several weeks . ) She was then entered in the one-hundred and two-hundred mile races . In 1910 she was again given the above preliminary training races , and allowed to compete in the two-hundred , three hundred , four-hundred , and five-hundred mile races . In 1911 and 1912 she was given the same amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she won the two-hundred and the five-hundred mile races , flying the five-hundred-mile race in about eleven hours . Shortly after this flight the bird was sent to Abilene , Texas , one thousand and ten miles ( air-line measure ) from Fort Wayne . The bird was liberated at 4.3o A.M. , July r1 , 1913 , and homed at 4 P.M. , July r2th , the flying time being one day , eleven hours , thirty minutes , and six seconds . In this same race a bird belonging to Mr. John Schilling homed at 11.3o A.M. the following day ( July 13th ) , and a third bird , belonging to Mr. F. Nahrwald , a half-hour later . All of the above races were flown under the rules of the American Racing Pigeon Union . The best previous record for one thousand miles was made by a pigeon belonging to II . Beech of Fort Wayne , in 1912 , the time being two days , nine hours , and some odd minutes . And this record lowered the time made in 1910 by a bird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time being three days , eleven hours , and some odd minutes . Such records will probably never be beaten except by happy combinations of strong favorable wind and clear , warm weather . Even in such amazing flights as these the supporters of the visual-landmark theory find nothing really more wonderful than what we see every day around a pigeon-loft ? viz. , the bird flying first to one familiar object of sight and then to the next one . Hachet-Souplet , one of the ablest supporters of this theory , has recently made some experiments with the homing - pigeon which lend some slight support to such a view . In order to test whether the birds can return over areas unknown to them he resorted to the use of traveling-cotes . Before any final tests were made , the birds , through experiments in other localities , were made thoroughly familiar with the outside of their own cotes . In a given test the cote was taken first into a strange locality and allowed to remain there for two or three days . We shall call this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and left at A , white the cote was driven on some four or five miles to a point B. The birds at A were then released . The birds , on release , mounted rapidly in the air and , spying the core , at once flew to it . Repeated tests showed that the distance between A and B could be increased up to about seven miles before the birds lost the ability to return . If the distance was increased to eight miles , none of the birds returned . After determining this distance , the experiment was modified : Upon arriving at point A , two birds at a time were tethered to the cote by means of a cord one hundred feet in length and allowed to fly to that height and survey the surrounding country . This was repeated for two or three days , then , as in the test above , these pigeons were left at A while the carriage was sent to B. It was found after many experiments that such birds as were allowed preliminary observation could return to the cote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ilachet Souplet believes that the birds ' view from the carriage at A gave them a set of " visual memories " which enabled them to fly to the cote even when the latter was not directly visible . The birds probably first flew to one distant familiar point , and then , if the cote itself was not visible , to another , etc. , until at some point the cote became visible . ' Theseexperiments were made only a short time ago and have not been confirmed by other experimenters . While they were inadequate to bring out the facts for which they were planned , they serve to show quite clearly the method by which the adherents of this theory would attempt to explain even the long flights obtained in the world records . Some of us , however , are not satisfied that such a theory will account for the facts of homing and migration . Even in advance of actual facts to the contrary , there happen to be obvious theoretical weaknesses in the theory of HachetSoupier . In the first place , our laboratory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forming visual habits of a kind to aid him in such flights . Certainly those of us familiar with the laboratory display of ingenuity in this bird can hardly convince ourselves that the few training flights such as we have already witnessed in the case of Bullet , the present world 's champion , can give the bird such a rapid command of so vast a territory as would be called for in her later performances . In the second place , convenient landmarks are not always at hand . When we consider the distance at which objects can be seen even by the sharpest human eye ( and the human eye is probably much keener than the bird 's eve ) we become still more skeptical . Mathematical considerations show that if the bird is at a given distance from its cote it must fly to a certain height in order to see it . To point out the difficulties in the way of this theory , Dr. Lashley and I have recently made a series of calculations to show the height to which the bird , at a given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the cote . We have made our calculation ( allowing for refraction ) to suit the conditions at Tortugas . The birds nest there on or near the ground , which is not much above sea-level . On one of the near-by islands , however , there is a lighthouse one hundred and fifty-one feet in height . In order to hefair to the theory we must suppose that the birds use the upper part of this as a landmark . As a result of this calculation we find that when the bird is one hundred miles away it has to fly approximately nine-tenths of a mile high ; when two hundred miles away , approxi-mately three miles high ; when five hundred miles away , twenty-five miles high ; and finally when nine hundred miles away , eighty-five miles high ! When we consider how rarefied the air becomes , and how low the temperature of the air is , at even two or three miles above the earth 's surface , we may be sure that few birds ( certainly few tropical birds ) ever reach even a height @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the homing-pigecn rarely rises above six hundred to nine hundred feet , and the terns at Tortugas usually fly at a height of less than three hundred feet . Certain investigators ( e.g. , Duchfitel ) , realizing the danger to the visual-landmark theory from this source , have been driven to the extreme position of main-taining the view that the bird does not use ordinary rays of light for vision ; but that its retina is sensitive to infra- luminous rays and sensitive especially to the long rays ( infra-red ) . They suppose , further , that the infra-red rays follow the surface of the earth . An animal using such rays could see its goal directly from great distances ? the curvature of the earth not interfering with the continuity of vision . Such a theory is based upon poor physical grounds . Had it been based upon the assumption that the bird is especially sensitive to the short , or ultra-violet , rays , , it would have been physically more defensible . The violet rays undergo greater refraction than the other rays by the earth 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a retina very sensitive to such rays might see its goal by rising to a slightly less height than man . We have recently entered into a somewhat elaborate test of the general question as to whether birds use rays of light to which the human retina is not sensitive . The experiment was carried out with the apparatus shown ( page 460 ) , which is used as follows : The apparatus is set up in a dark room ; through a small window one allows a beam of colored light ( monochromatic ) to fall upon the plaster-of-Paris surface . X ; the other plaster-of-Paris surface , XI , is not illuminated . The animal is kept in compartmeht H in darkness . The door E is then raised , and the animal allowed to go either toward X , the lighted side , or toward XI , the unlighted side . If he goes toward the lighted side he may pass on around through the door DI to food in compartment Fi . The door Di is then closed behind him . After a moment the animal is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If , on the other hand , the animal goes to the unlighted side , he finds the door D closed . Before obtaining food he must retrace his steps and finally pass through Di to the food . The apparatus is so arranged that the light may be made to fall either upon X or Xi . The animal must learn to go always to the lighted side . The homing-pigeon and the chick learn to do this very readily after a few trials , rarely making an error . We usually train the animal upon green . When perfect upon this we gradually c h an g e the wave-length of the light ? i.e. , pass successively through yellow , green , orange , red , etc. , until we come to the deep red . We finally reach a point where the animal " breaks down " ? i.e. , goes as often to the dark side as to the light side . This point gives us the limit of spectral sensitivity in the red . We next retrain our animal upon green until he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pass through the blue into the violets , etc . After a long series of such experiments we have found that the pigeon 's spectral range almost exactly coincides with man 's . Duchatel 's speculation therefore falls to the ground . If we are to explain horning in terms of the visual-landmark theory , we can not assume any superhuman powers of vision for the bird . Such unsatisfactory experimentation upon distant orientation as we have here set forth led us to consider possible ways of making a. crucial test as to whether birds can home from great distances over a territory which can offer no familiar landmarks . We decided that under the ordinary conditions of training and flying homing - pigeons we could never reach dependable results . If the pigeon could home over long stretches of water there would be no difficulty in making such a test . A moment 's consideration , however , will show that the pigeon can- not possibly home over water for a period longer than twelve or fourteen hours , and the distance covered in a day 's flight is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limitation is forced upon the pigeon by reason of the fact that it can neither sleep upon the water nor can it obtain food while flying over the water . To make such an experiment we must use birds which are as much at home upon the water as upon the land . Fortunately , as we have already noted , the conditions at Tortugas are almost ideal for making such an experiment . In the first place , the noddy and sooty terns are tropical , spending their winters along the shores of the Caribbean Sea . On or about the 25th of April they leave that region in a body and fly north to Bird Key . They remain there until the activities connected with nesting , brooding , and the rearing of the young are complete . While nesting they rarely leave Bird Key for distances greater than twenty miles . Consequently it becomes possible to send the birds anywhere north into a region never before visited by them . In the second place , Bird Key is the last point of land between Key West and Galveston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives us a magnificent opportunity to test whether the birds can home over a ninehundred-mile stretch of water which can offer apparently no possible visual landmarks . With these birds in this locality we can realize conditions which can not Von . CXXXL. ? No. 783. - 58 be realized in any homing-pigeon loft at the present time . In my previous article in Harper 's I gave the results of some successful test where the birds were sent one thousand miles north to Cape Hatteras . Three out of five birds sent to this point homed with ease and in a time which was then below the world 's record for the homing-pigeon . These results were found to be out of harmony with the visual-landmark theory . Several of the adherents of this theory wrote to me , however , and tried to explain the returns by assuming that the birds had been sent into a country colder than that to which they were accustomed , and that they instinctively flew along the shores of Florida toward a warmer region . Arriving in the neighborhood of Key West , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tortugas ( seventy-eight miles distant ) . Possibly such a theory of their return is correct , but it must be said that this explanation does not lend any support to the visual-landmark theory . At that time 1 had not been able to get any successful flights over the ninehundred-mile water stretch between Galveston and Bird Key . Our last season 's work in Tortugas was successful in this respect by reason of the fact that our early unsuccessful efforts led us to establish a better technique of capturing and marking the birds , feeding them en route , etc . In considering these experiments on the terns it must be remembered that we did not have to deal with a tame pigeon which is used to a shipping-basket and to being fed and watered by man . The terns are wild birds , wholly unused to man and to the ways of civilization in general . Furthermore , they are water-birds , drinking sea-water , and getting their food by picking up live minnows , which , when attacked by large fish , spring out over the surface of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially of caring for them on their long journeys , had to be learned by bitter experience . On a given day when we had made arrangements for shipping ( always a difficult task ) we began to capture the birds . As one passes over the island the boldest of them stay on the nests , or , if they do leave , they fly back while the experimenter is standing close to the nest . These bold birds are the ones always captured . Before passing over a given area for the purpose of capture , stakes about twelve inches long and one inch square are made . A large Dennison tag and a small tag are attached to the end of the stake , the small tag being attached loosely . The two tags bear identical legends . The large tag will have written upon it in waterproof ink , e.g. , " Sooty , Galveston , removed May i6th , marked with scarlet lake , 3 bars on head and neck . " When a sooty is captured the stake is pushed down into the sand ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a convenient twig . The small tag , bearing a duplicate of the above legend , is pulled off . The bird and small tag are handed to an assistant , who ties the tag around the bird 's neck and puts the animal into a portable cage . When enough birds have been collected the lot is taken hack to the house and the birds are marked with oil-paints as indicated by the card attached to each bird 's neck . The illustrations ( pp. 461 , 462 ) , show the clearness with **36;234;TOOLONG of the birds . The two birds shown in the photographs actually homed from five hundred and eighty-five miles over open water . After the birds are thus captured and marked they arc put into a shipping-cage and sent to Key West , where a large supply of minnows is obtained for feeding them en route . On the trip in which successful results were obtained Dr. Lashley took the birds in charge , and at Key West boarded the Mallory steamer which sailed directly for Galveston . The birds were released at two points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Galveston Harbor . Ten birds were released when five hundred and eighty-five miles alit ; eight of them returned to the nest . Two birds were released at night in a driving rain when seven hundred and twenty miles out . Both returned . Twelve birds were released in Galveston Harbor , eight hundred and fifty-fiv=e miles from Bird Key . Only three birds returned . That only three birds returned is not surprising , in view of the fact that by the time Galveston was reached the birds were in poor condition ? they had to be forcibly fed . When released they flew at once to the shore to rest , and many were doubtless captured by the hawks which line the Galveston shores . This is certainly the most astonishing record of returns ever obtained under experimental conditions . We have here large numbers of birds returning over open water from all distances up to approximately nine hundred miles . Here there can be no question of flying high enough to see Bird Key directly , nor of an instinctive following of a coast-line into a warmer climate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bird Key . Nor can there be any question of visual landmarks in the customary meaning of that term . That reasonable landmark theory which , if it were true , would explain all of the flights of hominglairds on the ordinary grounds of habit formation seems here to break down completely . We are left apparently with the inference that there is such a thing as distant orientation , but without any explanation of how it is effected . Strange as it may seem , this does not discourage us ; the mere establishment of the fact that there is a genuine problem in homing will give to scientific investigators a stimulus to further work which has been lacking before . It is unbelievable that the problems connected with homing and migration can long resist the combined attacks of scientific students .
