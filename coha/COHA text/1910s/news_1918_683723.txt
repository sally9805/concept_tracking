txt The House goes further than the Senate in giving the President power to fix railway rates , and will be supported in so doing . Whatever preference there might be for ' other methods in peace should be waived under conditions of war , and under the experience of other methods in peace . Congress and the Interstate Commerce Commission . have alike disqualified themselves to deal with the subject . Both must share the blame for the present railway embargo . The fault lies ' primarily with Congress , for it was the source of the Commission 's ' power , and it was its duty to see that the Commission used wisely the powers intrusted to it . The Commission 's disqualification is twofold . Its numbers prevent quick and unanimous action , under such an emergency as war , and its procedure has shown personal unfitness for the duty even in normal times . The making of rates requires foresight , since it is essentially an act of discretion regarding future conditions . Rates should be revised only to correct existing conditions , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work under conditions not known . The Commission was told plainly what the result of not raising rates would be . The result has followed , and can not be agreeable to the Commission . It is consistent to make the Executive of the country the executive of the railways as well as of the military forces . The two duties are related intimately during war , and can hardly be performed suitably otherwise . Rates are related to the efficiency of the railways , the finances of the Treasury , and the conduct of the war . These relations involve conditions requiring summary decisions not consistent with prolonged debate . The responsibility is great , but there is no man or body of men more fit to be trusted to deal greatly with great subjects than the President . The objections are many , but they should be waived , and emphasis should be placed upon the requirement that the functions . necessitated by the emergency shall cease with the emergency . It is plain that rates will be raised summarily , and raised more than would be necessary if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be an outcry , but only from those put in the wrong by the events . No one pays a fare or rate without receiving more than money 's worth . Few pay anything to the railways without getting It back with increase , either in profits from the service or in personal use of the service . There is no one who will not benefit directly or indirectly by generous treatment of the railways . The Government will profit more than all , for Liberty loans will be promoted more by making the railways profitable than by any other one thing . The depression of the railway security market must be corrected , not merely from tenderness for the railways but as first aid to the credit market . The best hope of keeping down the rate of interest on Liberty bonds is to make the yields upon first-class railway securities less attractive than they now are because of the low market price . The alternative to raising rates is raising taxes , as to which there should be neither doubt nor delay .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
