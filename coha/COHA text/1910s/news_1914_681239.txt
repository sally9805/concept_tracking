txt Mt . Vernon 's Garment of Roses . The Hanging Gardens of Babylon are a thing of the past , in fact many centuries Past , but today one may see on the outskirto of the city , a half mile billow of roses ? beautiful pink Dorothy Perkins ? tumbling down In glorious profusion along the north aide of the New York , New Haven d : Hartford Railroad cut in Mount Vernon . They are now In full bloom and present a Most pleasing sight as one journeys either on the New Haven trains or the trolley cars operating along First Street . Mount Vernon , between the New Haven Depot and the , New Tork City line . From the top of the high stone wall on the north side of the railroad cut , which they cover and overhang six to ten feet or more , they sway gracefully to and fro with each eddying breeze , refreshing the tired commuter on his way home with their beauty and filling Mount Vernonites with a feeling of pride In their picturesque little city . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see them .
