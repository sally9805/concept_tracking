Ax expert on Greek art chanced to describe in my hearing one of the engraved gems in the Metropolitan Museum . He spoke of it as ' certainly one of the great gems of the world , ' and there was something in his tone that was even more thrilling than his words . Ile might have been describing the Part henna , or Beethoven 's Mass , ? such was the passion of reverence that flowed out of him as he spoke . I went to SC ( ' the gem afterwards . It was badly placed , and for all artistic purposes was invisible . I suppose that even if I had had a good look at it , I should not have been able to appreciate its full merit . Who could ? save the handful of adepts in the world , the little group of gem-readers , by whom the mighty music of this tiny score could be read at sight ? Nevertheless it was a satisfaction to me to have seen the stone . I knew that through its surface there poured the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phidias and Aristotle , and not wit host the Parthenon , could it have come into existence . It carried in its bosom a digest of the visual laws of spiritual force ; and was as wonderful and as sacred as any stone could well be . Its value to mankind was not to be measured by my comprehension of it , but was inestimable . As Petrarch felt toward the Greek manuscript of Homer which he owned but could not read , so did I feel toward the gem . What is Education ? What are Art and Religion and all those higher interests in civilization which are alwaysvaguely held up to us as being the most important things in life ? These things elude definition . They can not be put into words except through the interpositionof what theGermanscall a ' metaphysic . ' Before you can introduce them into discourse , you must step aside for a moment and create a theory of the universe ; and by the time you have done this , you have perhaps befogged yourself and exhausted your readers . Let us be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take a general view of the externals of these subjects without losing reverence for their realities . It is possible to consider the forms under which art and religion appear , ? the algebra and notation by which they have expressed themselves in the past , ? and to draw sonic general conclusion as to the nature of the subject , without becoming entangled in the subject itself . We may deal with the influence of the gem without striving exactly to translate its meaning into speech . We all concede its importance . We know , for instance , that the admiration of my friend the expert was no accident . He found in the design and workmanship of the intaglio the same ideas which he had been at work on all his life . Greek culture long ago had become a part of this man 's brain , and its hiero-glyphs expressed what to him was re-ligion . So of all monuments , languages , and arts which descend to us out of the past . The peoples are dead , but the documents remain ; and these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tradition which also descends to us out of the past , ? a tradition so familiar and native to the brain that we forget its origin . We almost believe that our feeling for art is original with us . We are tempted to think there is some personal and logical reason at the back of all grammar , whether it be the grammar of speech or the grammar of architecture , ? so strong is the appeal to our taste made by traditional usage . Yet the great reason of the power of art is the historic reason . ' In this manner have these things been expressed ; in similar manner must they continue to be said . ' So speaks our artistic instinct . Good usage has its sanction , like religion or government . We transmit the usage without pausing to think why we do so . We instinctively correct a child , without pausing to reflect that the fathers of the race are speaking through us . When the child says Give me a apple , ' we correct him . You must say " an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fact , is an apple . All teaching is merely a way of acquainting the learner with the body of existing tradition . If the child is ever to have anything to say of his own , he has need of every bit of this expressive medium to help him do it . The reason is , that , so far as expressiveness goes , only one language exists . Every experiment and usage of the past is a part of this language . A phrase or an idea rises in the Hebrew , and filters through the Greek or Latin and French , down to our own time . The practitioners who scribble and dream in words from their childhood up , ? into whose habit of thought language is kneaded through a thousand reveries , ? these are the men who receive , reshape , and transmit it . Language is their portion : they are the priests of language . The same thing holds true of the other vehicles of idea , ? of painting , architecture , religion , etc. ; but since we have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language . Expressiveness follows literacy . The poets have been tremendous readers always , ? Petrarch , Dante , Chaucer , Shakespeare , Milton , Goethe , Byron , Keats ; those of them who possessed not much of the foreign languages had a passion for translations . It is amazing how little of a foreign language you need if you have a passion for the thing written in it . We think of Shakespeare as of a lightly-lettered person ; but he was ransacking books all day to find plots and language for his plays . He reeks with mythology ; he swims in classical metaphor ; and , if he knew the Latin poets only in translation , he knew them with that famished intensity of interest which can draw the meaning through the walls of a bad text . Deprive Shakespeare of his sources , and he could not have been Shakespeare . Good poetry is the echoing of shadowy tongues , the recovery of forgotten talent , the garment put up with perfumes . There is a passage in the Tempest which illustrates the freemasonry of artistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the mighty . Prospero 's apostrophe to the spirits is , surely , as Shakespearean as anything in Shakespeare and as beautiful as anything in imaginative poetry . he elve roo , fshills , brooks , standing lakes and And ye that on the sands with printless foot Do chase the ebbing Neptune , and do fly him , When he comes back ; you demi-puppets that By moonshine do the green sour ringlets make , Whereof the ewe not bites ; and you , whose pas-time Is to make midnight mushrooms ; that rejoice To hear the solemn curfew ; by whose aid ( Weak masters though ye be ) I have bedimm 'd The noontide sun , call 'd forth the mutinous winds , And ' twixt the green sea and the azured vault Set roaring war : to the dread rattling thunder Have I given fire , and rifted Jove 's stout oak With his own bolt : the strong-based promontory Have I made shake ; and by the spurs pluck 'd up The pine and cedar : graves , at my command , llave waked their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so potent art . Shakespeare borrowed this speech front Medea 's speech in Ovid , which lie knew in the translation of Arthur Golding ; and really Shakespeare scents almost to have held the book in his hand while penning Prospero 's speech . The following is from Golding 's translation , published in 1567 . There is , and is to be , no end of this reappearance of old metaphor , old trade secrets , old usage of art . No sooner has a masterpiece appeared , that summarizes all knowledge , than men get up eagerly the next morning with chisel and brush , and try again . Nothing done satisfies . It is all in the making that the inspiration lies ; and this endeavor renews itself with the ages , and grows by devouring its own offspring . The technique of any art is the whole body of experimental knowledge through which the art speaks . The glazes of pottery become forgotten and have to be hit upon over again . The knack of Venetian glass , the principle of effect in tiles , in lettering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tower , ? all the prestidigitation of art that is too subtle to be named or thought of , must yet be acquired and kept up by practice , held to by constant experiment . Good artistic expression is thus not only a thing done : it is a way of life , a habit of breathing , a mode of unconsciousness , a world of being which records itself as it unrolls . We call this world Art for want of a better name ; but the thing that we value is the life within , not the shell of the creature . This shell is what is left behind in the passage of time , to puzzle our after study and make us wonder how it was made , how such complex delicacy and power ever came to coexist . I have often wondered over the Merchant of Venice , as one wonders over a full-blown transparent poppy that sheds light and blushes like a cloud . Neither the poppy nor the play was exactly hewn out : they grew , they expanded and bloomed by a sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine arts blossom from the old stock , ? from the poppy-seed of the world . I am here thinking of the whole body of the arts , the vehicles through which the spirit of man has been expressed . I am thinking also of the sciences , ? whose refractory , belligerent worshipers are even less satisfied with any past expression than the artists are , for their mission is to destroy and to rearrange . They would leave nothing alive but themselves . Nevertheless , science has always been obliged to make use of written language in recording her ideas . The sciences are as much a part of recorded language as the arts . No matter how revolutionary scientific thought may be , it must resort to metaphysics when it begins to formulate its ultimate meanings . Now , when you approach metaphysics , the Greek and the Hebrew have been there before you ; you are very near to matters which perhaps you never intended to approach . You are back at the beginning of all things . In fact , human thought does not advance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scale is a key-note ; and every point in the universe is the centre of the universe ; and every man is the centre and focus of the cosmos , and through him passes the whole of all force , as it exists and has existed from eternity ; hence the significance which may at any moment radiate out of anything . The different arts and devices that time hands to us are like our organs . They are the veins and arteries of humanity . You can not rearrange them or begin anew . Your verse-forms and your architecture are chosen for you , like your complexion and your temperament . The thing you desire to express is in them already . Your labors do no more than to enable you to find your own soul in them . If you will begin any piece of artistic work in an empirical spirit and slave over it until it suits you , you will find yourself obliged to solve all the problems which the artists have been engaged on since the dawn of history . Be as independent as you like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every point ; you are a slave to precedent , because precedent has done what you are trying to do , and ah , how much better ! In the first place the limitations , the horrible limitations of artistic possibility , will begin to present themselves : few things can be done ; they have all been tried ; they have all been worked to death ; they have all been developed by immortal genius and thereafter avoided by lesser minds , ? left to await more immortal genius . The field of endeavor narrows itself in proportion to the greatness of the intellect that is at work . In ages of great art every one knows what the problem is and how much is at stake . Masaeeio died at the age of twenty-seven , after having painted half a dozen pictures which influenced all subsequent art , because they showed to Raphael the best solution of certain technical questions . The Greeks of the best period were so very knowing that everything appeared to them ugly except the few attitudes , the few arrange . ments , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has something to say is thus found to be in one sense a slave : but a rich slave who has inherited the whole earth . If you can only obey the laws of your slavery , you become an emperor ; you are only a slave in so far as you do not understand how to use your wealth . If you have but the gift of submission , you conquer . Many tongues , many hands , many minds , a traditional state of feeling , traditional symbols , ? the whole passed through the eyes and soul of a single man . ? such is art , such is human expression in all its million-sided variety . II I have thrown together these remarks in an elliptical and haphazard way , hoping to show what sort of thing education is , and as a prologue to a few reflections upon the educational conditions in the United States . It is easy to think of reasons why the standards of general education should be low in America . Almost every influ- // CI1CC which is hostile to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the maximum of destruct-be power in the United States . We are a new society , made of a Babel of conflicting European elements , engaged in exploiting the wealth of a new continent , under conditions of climate Inch involve a nervous reorganization for Europeans who come to live with us . Our history has been a history of quiet colonial beginnings , followed by a national life which from its incept ion has been one of social unrest . And all this has happened during the great epoch of the expansion of commerce , the thought-destroying epoch of the world . Let us take a rapid glance at our own past . In the beginning we were settlers . Now , the settlement of any new continent plays havoc with the arts and crafts . Let us imagine that among the Mayflower pilgrims there were a few expert wood-carvers , a violin-player or two , and a master architect . These men , upon landing in the colony , must have been at a loss for employment . They would have to turn into backwoodsmen . Their accomplishments would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the landing of the pilgrims there must have followed a decline in the fine arts , in scholarship , and in certain kinds of social refinement . This decline was , to sonic extent , counteracted in our colonial era by the existence of wealth in the colonies and by the constant intercourse with Europe , from which the newest models were imported by every vessel . Nevertheless , it is hard for a colony to make up for its initial loss ; and we have recently seen the United States government making efforts on a large scale to give to the American farmer those practices of intensive cultivation of the soil which he lost by becoming a backwoodsman and Vol .. irk ; NO. has never since had time to recover for himself . The American Revolution was our second serious set-back in education . So hostile to culture is war that the artisans of France have never been able to attain to the standards of workmanship which prevailed under the old monarchy . Our national culture started with the handicap of a seven-years ' war , and was always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizen was buffeting the waves of new development . His daily life was an experiment . His moral , social , political interests and duties were indeterminate . Nothing was settled for him by society . Was a man to have an opinion ? Then he must make it himself . This demands a more serious labor than if he were obliged to manufacture his own shoes and candlesticks . No such drafts upon individual intellect are made in an old country . You can not get a European to understand this distressing over-taxing of the intelligence in America . Nothing like it has occurred before , because in old countries opinion is part of caste and condition ; opinion is the shadow of interest and of social status . But in America the individual is not protected against society at large by the bulwark of his class . He stands by himself . It is a noble idea that a man should stand by himself , and the conditions which force a man to do so have occasionally created magnificent types of heroic manhood in America . Lincoln , Garrison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these very conditions which isolate the individual in America and force him to think for himself . Yet their effect upon general cultivation has been injurious . It seems as if character were always within the reach of every human soul ; but men must have become homogeneous before they can produce art . We have thus reviewed a few of the causes of our American loss of cult ure . Behind all these causes , however , was the true and overmastering cause , namely , that sudden creation of wealth for which the nineteenth century is noted , the rise all over the world of new and uneducated classes . We came into being as a part of that world-movement which has perceptibly retarded culture , even in Europe . How then could we in America hope to resist it ? Whether this movement is the result of democratic ideas , or of mechanical inventions , or of scientific discovery , no one can say . The elements that go to make up the movement can not be unraveled . We only know that the world has changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with all its experience , with all its refinement . In its place we have a crude world , indifferent to everything except physical well-being . In the place of the fine arts and the crafts , we have business and science . Business is , of course , devoted to the increase of physical well-being ; and science is , in all except its highest reaches of thought , a mere extension of business . Science is the theory of world-business , race-business , cosmic business . Science saves lives and dominates the air and the sea , science does a hundred wonders , and all of us are incredibly in debt to science , and we should not be ungrateful . But science does not express spiritual truth . It . neither sings nor jokes , it neither prays nor rejoices , it neither loves nor hates . It respects only its own language and its own habits of thought , and puts trust only in what is in its own shop-window . ' What is science ? ' you ask . Now , science is anything which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one decade science means the discussion of spontaneous variation , in the next of plasm , in the next of germs or of electrodes . I do not undervalue the accomplishments of science ; but I deprecate the contempt which science expresses for anything that does not happen to be called science . Imperial and haughty science proclaims its occupancy of the whole province of human thought ; yet , as a matter of fact , science deals in a language of its own , in a set of formulte and conceptions which can not cover the most important interests of humanity . It does not understand the value of the fine arts , and is always at loggerheads with philosophy . Is it not clear that science , in order to make good her claim to universality , must adopt a conception of her own function that shall leave to the fine arts and to religion their languages ? She can not hope to compete with these languages , nor to translate nor to ex. pound them . She must accept them . At present she tramples upon them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two influences which are hostile to education , ? the influence of business and the influence of science . In Europe these influences are qualified by the vigor of the old learning . In America they dominate remorselessly , and make the path of education doubly hard . Consider how they meet us in ordinary social life . We have all heard men bemoan the time they have spent over Latin and Greek , on the ground that these studies did not fit them for business , ? as if a thing must be worth less if it can be neither eaten nor drunk . It is hard to explain the value of education to men who have forgotten the meaning of education : its symbols con. vey nothing to them . The situation is very similar in dealing with scientific men , ? at least with that large class of them who have little learning and no religion , and who are thus obliged to use the formula of modern science as their only vehicle of thought . These men regard Int . inanity as something which started up Darwin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are mentioned ; and if they did they would not understand . When Darwin confessed that poetry had no meaning for him , and that nothing significant was left to hint in the whole artistic life of the past , he did not know how many of his brethren his words were destined to describe . We can forgive the business man for the loss of his birthright ; he knows no boner . But we have it against a scientist if he undervalues education . Surely the Latin classics are as valuable a deposit as the crustacean fossils or the implements of the stone age . When science shall have assumed her true relation to the field of human culture , we shall all be happier . To-day science knows that t he silkworm must be fed on the leaves of the mulberry tree , but does not know that the soul of man must be fed on the Bible and the Greek classics . Science knows that a queen he can be produced by care and feeding , but does not as yet know that every man who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a different species from the ignorant man . ND matter how lit tle it may have beer , it reclassifies him . There is more hindhip between that man and a great scholar than there is between the same man and some one who has had no classics at all ; he breathes from a different part of his anatomy . Drop the classics from education ? Ask rather , Why not drop education ? for the classics are ? duat ion . We can not draw a line and say , ? Here we start . ' The facts are the at her way . We started long ago , and our very life depends upon keeping alive all that we have thought and felt during our history . If the continuity is taken from us , we shall relapse . When we discover t hat these two t re- ness and science he not parts of the same interest ? have arisen in the modern world and are muffling the voice of man , we tremble for the future . If these giants shall continue their subjugation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may relapse into dumbness . By good fortune , however , there are other powers at work . The race is emotionally too rich and too much attached to the past to allow its faculties to be lost through disuse . New and spontaneous crops will soon be growing upon the mould of our own stubbly , thistle-bearing epoch . In the mean time we in America must do the best we can . It is no secret that our standards of education are below those of Europe . Our art , our historical knowledge , our music and general conversation , show a stiffness and lack of exuberance , a lack of vitality and of unconscious force , ? the faults of beginners in all walks of life . During the last twenty-five years much improvement has been made in those branches of cultivation which depend directly upon wealth . Since the Civil War there seems to have been a decline in the higher literature , accompanied by an advance in the plastic arts . And more recently still , there has been a literary reawakening , perhaps not of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If I may employ an obvious simile , I would liken America to a just-grown young man of good impulses , who has lacked early advantages . He feels that cultivation belongs to him ; and yet he can not catch it nor hold it . He feels the impulse of expression , and yet . Ile can neither read nor write . He feels that he is fitted for general society ; and yet he has no current ideas or conversation . And , of course , ? I say it with regret , but it is a part of the situation , ? of course , he is heady and proud of himself . genuous youth on whom the postponed expectation of the world , as Emerson called it , has waited so long ? We desire only to furnish him with true advantages . Let us take a simultaneous survey of the two extremities of the youth 's education , namely , of nursery training and the higher education . The two are more intimately dependent upon each other than is generally suspected . With regard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The focus of all cultivation is the fireside . Learning is a stove-plant that lives in the cottage and thrives during the long winter in domestic warmth . Unless it be born into children in their earliest years , there is little hope for it . The whole future of the world depends upon what is read to children before they can read to themselves . The world is powerless to re-convey itself through any mind that it has not lived in from the beginning , ? so hard is the language of symbols , whether in music , or in poetry , or in painting . The arts must expand with the heart , as a hot rod of glass is touched by the gold-leaf and is afterwards blown into dusty stars and rainbows of mantling irradiation . If the glass expand before it has been touched by the metal , there is no means of ever getting the metal into it . The age of machinery has peopled this continent with promoters and millionaires , and the work of a thousand years has been done in a century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some cost . An ignorant man makes a fortune and demands the higher education for his children . But it is too late : he should have given it to them when he was in his shirtsleeves . All that they are able to receive now is something very different from education . In receiving it they drag clown the old standards . School and college are filled with illiterates . The whole land must wait patiently till Learning has warmed back to life her chilled and starved descendants . Perhaps the child or grandchild of the fortune-builder will teach the children on his knee what he himself learned too late in life to stead him much . Hunger and thirst for learning is a passion that comes , as it were , out of the ground ; now in an age of wealth , now in an age of poverty . Young men are born whom nothing will satisfy except the arts and the sciences . They seek out some scholar at a university and aim at him from boyhood . They persuade their parents to send them to college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offers except this thing . Now , society does not create this hunger . All that society can do is to provide nourishment of the right kind , good instruction , true learning , the best scholarship which history has left behind . I believe that to-day there is a spirit of learning abroad in America , ? here and there , in the young , ? the old insatiable passion . I feel as if men were arising ? most of them still handicapped by the lack of early training ? to whom life has no meaning except as a search for the truth . This exalted famine of the young scholar is the hope of the world . It is religion and art and science in the chrysalis . The thing that society must beware of doing is of interposing between the young learner and his natural food some mechanical product or patent food of its own . Good culture means the whole of culture in its original sources ; had culture is any substitute for this . Let us now examine the higher departments of education , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the learned world in America . There is one function of learned men which is the same in every age , namely , the production of text-books . Learned men // shed text-books as the oak sheds acorns , and by their fruits ye shall know them . Open almost any primary text-book or school-book in America , and you will , on almost every page of it , find inelegancies of usage , roughnesses , inaccuracies and occasional errors of grammar . The book has been written by an incompetent band . Now , what has the writer lacked ? Is it grammar ? Is it acquaintance with English literature , with good models , with the Bible , with history ? It is all these things , and more . No school-room teaching can make a man write good English . No school-teaching ever made an educated man , or a man who could write a good primary text-book . It requires a home of early cult ure , supplemented by the whole curriculum of scholarship and university training . Nothing but this great engine will produce that little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you employ the nearest excellent young lady music-teacher to teach your boys to play the piano , she will bring into the house certain child 's music written by American composers , in which the rules of harmony are violated , and of which the sentiment is vulgar . The books have been written by incompetent people . There is a demand for such hooks , and they are produced . They are the best the times afford ; let us be glad that they exist at all , and that they are no worse . But note this : it will require the whole musical impulse of the age , from the oratorio society and the musical college down to the street-organ , to correct the grammar of that child 's music-book . Ten or twenty years from now a like book will perhaps be brought intoyour home , filled with better harmony and with truer musical feeling ; and the change sill have been wrought through the influence of Sebastian Bach , of Beethoven ,  --  of the masters of music . It i. t he same with all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , over the professional school , over the community . If you read the lives of the painters of Italy or of the musicians of Germany , you will find that , no matter where a child of genius was born , there was always an educated man to be found in the nearest village ? a priest or a schoolmaster ? who gave the child the rudiments himself , and became the means of sending him to the university . Without this indigent scholar , where would have been the great master ? It is familiarity with greatness that we need , ? an early and first-hand acquaintance with the thinkers of the world , whether their mode of thought be music or marble or canvas or language . Their meaning is not easy to come at , but in so far as it reaches us it will transform us . A strange thing has occurred in America . I am not sure that it has ever occurred before . The teachers wish to make learning easy . They desire to prepare and peptonize and sweeten the food . Their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading on great subjects ; but these books are filled with a pervading error ; they contain a subtle perversion of education . Learning is not easy , but hard ; culture is severe . The steps to Parnassus are steep and terribly arduous . This truth is often forgotten among us ; and yet there are fields of work in which it is not forgotten , and in such fields art springs up . Let us remember the accomplishments of our country . The art in which we now most excel is architecture . America has in it many beautiful buildings and some learned architects . And how he s this come about ? Through severe and conscientious study of the monuments of art , through humble , old-fashioned training . The architects have had first-rate text-books , generally written by Eu- ropeans , the non-peptonized , gritty , serious language of masters in the craft . Our painters have done something of the same sort . They have gone to Europe , and are conversant with what is being done in Europe . If they are developing their art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with consciousness of the past . I do not recommend subservience to Europe , but subservience to intellect . Recourse to Europe we must have ; our scholars must absorb Europe , without themselves becoming absorbed . It is a curious thing that the American who comes in contact with the old world exhibits two opposite faults : he is often too much impressed , and loses stamina ; or he is too little impressed , and remains a barbarian . Contact with the past and hard work are the cure for both tendencies . Europe is merely an incidental factor in the problem of our education ; and this is very well shown in the conduct of our law schools . The Socratic method of instruction in law schools was first introduced at Harvard , and since then it has spread to many parts of the world . This is undoubtedly one of our best achievements in scholarship ; and Europe had , so far as I know , no hand in it . The method consists in the viva race discussion of leading cases , text-books being used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sources for himself . Here we have American scholarship at , its best , and it is precisely the same thing as the European article ; it is simply scholarship . If we can exhibit this spirit in one branch of learning , why not in all ? The Promethean fire is one single element . A spark of this fire is all that is needed to kindle this flame . The glance of a child of genius at an Etruscan vase leaves the child a new being . That is why museums exist : not only for the million who get something from them , but for the one young person of intelli. gence to whom they mean everything . Our American universities exhibit very vividly all the signs of retardation in culture which are traceable in other parts of our social life . A university is always a stronghold of the past , and is therefore one of the last places to be captured by new influence . Commerce has been our ruler for many years ; and yet it is only quite recently that the philosophy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man is not a monster ; but he is a person who desires to advance his own interests . This is his occupation , and , as it were , his religion . The advancement of material interests constitutes civilization to him . He unconsciously infuses the ideas and methods of business into anything that he touches . It has thus come about in America that our universities are beginning to be run as business colleges . They advertise , they compete with one another , they pretend to give good value to their customers , They desire to increase their trade , they offer social advantages and business openings to their pat runs . In some cases they boldly conduct intelligence offices , and guarantee that no hard work done by the student shall be done in vain ; a record of work is kept during the student 's college life , and the college undertakes to furnish him at any time thereafter with references and a character which shall help him in the struggle for life . This miscarriage of education has been developed and is being conducted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adaptation of their own souls to the spirit of the age . The underlying philosophy of these men might be stated as follows : There is nothing in life nobler than for a man to improve his condition and the condition of his children . Learning is a means to this end . ' Such is the // current American conception of educaI ; on . How far we have departed from he idea of education as a search for truth , or as the vehicle of spiritual expression , may be seen herein . The change of creeds has come about innocently , and the consequences involved in it are , as yet , perceived by hardly a n v one . The skepticism inherent in the new creed is concealed by its benevolence . You wish to help the American youth . This unfortunate , benighted , ignorant boy , who has from his cradle heard of nothing but business success as t h e one goal of all human effort , turns to you for instruction . He comes to you in a trusting spirit , with reverence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this wise : ' Business and social success are the best things that life affords . Come to us , my dear fellow , and we will help you toward them . ' Your son asks you for bread and you give him a stone , for fish and you give him a serpent . It would have been better for t hat boy if he had never come to your college ; for then he might have retained a belief that somewhere in the world there existed ideas , art , enthusiasm , unselfishness , inspiring activity . in so far as our universities have been turning into business agencies , they have naturally lost their imaginative importance . Our professors seem to be of little more consequence in the community than the department managers of other large shops . If learning is a useful commodity which is to be distributed for the personal advantage of the recipients , it is a thing to be paid for rather than worshiped . To be sure , the whole of past history can not be swept away in a day , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rhetorical reverence for learning . A dash and varnish of education are thought to be desirable , ? the wash that . is growing every year more thin . Now , the truth is that the higher education does not advance a man 's personal influence except under special circumstances . What it gives a man is the power of expression ; but the ability to express himself has kept many a man poor . Let no one imagine that society is likely to reward him for self-expression in any walk of life . He is much more likely to be punished for it . The question of a man 's success in life depends upon society at large . The more highly an age is educated , the more highly it rewards education in the individual . In an age of indifference to learning , the educated man is at a disadvantage . Thus the thesis that education advances self-interest ? that thesis upon which many of our colleges are now being conducted ? is substantially false . The little scraps and snatches of true education which a man now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are finding this out year by year ; and as they do so , they naturally throw the whole conception of the higher education overboard . If education is to break down as a commercial asset , what excuse have they for retaining it at all ? They will force the colleges to live up to the advertisements , and to furnish the kind of education that pays its way . It is clear that if the colleges persist in the utilitarian view , the higher learning will disappear . It has been disappearing very rapidly , and can be restored only through the birth of a new spirit and of a new philosophic attitude in our university life . There are ages when the scholar receives recognition during his lifetime , and when the paths which lead to his lecture-room are filled with men drawn there by his fame . This situation arises in any epoch when human intellect surges up and asserts itself against tyranny and ignorance . In the past the tyrannies have been political tyrannies , and these have become well understood through the struggles of intellect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new thing , and as yet little understood . It lies like a heavy fog of intellectual depression over the whole kingdom of Mammon , and is fed by the smoke from a million factories . The artist works in it , the thinker thinks in it . Even the saint is born in it . The rain of ashes from the nineteenth-century Vesuvius of business seems to be burying all our landscape . And yet this is not true . We shall emerge , even we who are in America and suffer most . The important points to be watched are our university classrooms . If our colleges will but allow something unselfish , something that is true for its own sake , something that is part of the history of the human heart and intellect , to live in their classrooms , the boys will find their way to it . The museum holds the precious urn , to preserve it . The university , in like manner , stands to house the alpha- bets of civilization , ? the historic in. struments and agencies of intellect . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very name and function of the place imply . The presidents and professors who sit beside the fountains of knowledge bear different labels and teach subjects that are called by various names . But the thing which carries the label is no more than the shell . The life you can not label ; and it is to foster this life that universities exist . Enthusiasm comes out of the world and goes into the university . Toward this point flows the current of new talent that bubbles up in society ; here is the meeting-place of mind . All that a university does is to give the poppy-seed to the soil , the oil to the lamp , the gold to the rod of glass before it cools . A university brings the spirit in touch with its own language , that language through which it has spoken in former days and through which alone it shall speak again .
