Assistant Professor of History , University of Chicago similar to methods in the slave-trade ; the classes of people from which some servants were drawn ? convicts , paupers , and dissolute persons of every type ; the stormy life of many servants , and the troublesome moral and social problems which their presence engendered , such as intermarriage with negro slaves ; the runaway criminal servants , and their influence on moral standards and on oth- er phases of life in the colonies . White servitude developed rapidly because of favorable conditions ? a large demand for servants coupled with a large supply . The economic theory of European states in the seventeenth century called for a large population in their colonies , in order that trade and commerce might develop rapidly . The colonists were to supply food and raw materials , and the home country was to develop manufactures . Means , therefore , must be devised , first , to attract settlers who would develop the economic resources of the colonies , and , second , to provide them with an adequate supply of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which in the Southern and middle colonies were usually granted in a manner to promote rapid increase of population and extension of cultivated tracts . This method was known as the " head-right " system . Any one emigrating was rewarded with a gift of land ? about a hundred and fifty acres . Since labor was needed to clear and work this land , any one importing a servant was entitled to an additional allotment , a " head right . " To induce laborers to emigrate , a similar allotment was promised to them after each had served a term of years as a servant . Thus free land solved the two most pressing problems mentioned above . Fortunately , the enormous demand for white servants came when economic conditions had created a large supply . In the sixteenth century English agriculture was giving way to sheep-raising , so that a few herders often took the place of many farm laborers . As a result , the unemployed , the poor , and the criminal classes increased rapidly . Justices , who were land-owners , had the power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they made them very low , hardly a shilling a day ; for the lower the wage the greater the profits of the tenant farmer , and therefore the greater his ability to pay higher rents demanded by the land-owner . Thus , while wages remained practically stationary , wheat multiplied in price nearly four times in this period , i5oo-i600 . In other words , a man worked forty weeks in 160o for as much food as he received in 15oo by working ten weeks . To prevent scarcity of farm laborers , the statute of apprentices ( 1563 ) forbade any one below the rank of a yeoman to withdraw from agricultural pursuits to be apprenticed to a trade . Moreover , the poor laws passed in this period compelled each parish to support its poor , and provided penalties for vagrancy . Thus the farm laborer had no chance to better himself . Conditions were almost beyond description , and in dear years people pen-shed from famine . Sheffield in 1615 , with a population of 2,207 , had 725 relying on charity , 37.8 per cent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarded as a convenient dumping-ground for undesirable citizens . Velasco , the Spanish minister in England , wrote his sovereign , 1611 , " Their principal reason for colonizing these parts is to give an outlet to so many idle , wretched people as they have in England , and thus prevent the dangers that might be feared of them . " It is evident that if this surplus population could he transferred to the American colonies , both the mother-country and the colonists would profit . One of the earliest proposals was made by Sir George Peckham , 1582 . He declared that there were such great numbers living in penury and want that they might be willing to " hazard their lives and serve one year for meat , drinke , and apparell only without wages , in hope thereby to amend their estates . " It was natural for men and women , in order tosecure free transportation to America , to bind themselves by written contract , called an indenture , to serve some individual for a term of years . There were three main classes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an agent , often the shipmaster , was called an indentured servant . The shipmaster reimbursed himself , on arrival in America , by selling the time of the servant to the highest bidder . The second class included the " redemptioners , " or " free-willers . " They signed no contract beforehand , but were given transportation by the shipmaster with the understanding that on arrival they were to have a few days to indenture themselves to some one to pay for their passage . Failing this , the shipmaster could sell them himself . The free-wilier then was at a great disadvantage . He had to bargain in competition with many others , and was so much at the mercy of the buyer or shipmaster that laws were passed by several colonies limiting his time of service and defining his rights . The third class consisted of those forced into servitude , such as convicts , felons , vagrants , and dissolute persons , and those kidnapped or " spirited " away by the so-called " spirits " or " crimps . " Convicts were often granted royal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charles I. in 1635 gave orders to the sheriff of London to deliver to Captain Thomas Hill or Captain Richard Carleton nine female convicts for removal to Virginia , to be sold as servants . At an early date judges imposed penalties of transportation on convicted criminals and others . Thus Narcissus Luttrell notes in his diary , Nov. 17 , 1692 , that the magistrates had ordered on board a ship lying at Leith , bound for Virginia , fifty lewd women out of the house of correction and thirty others who walked the streets at night . An act of Parliament in 1718 gave judges still greater power by allowing them to order the transportation of convicts for seven years , known as " His Majesty 's seven-year passengers , " and , in case the penalty for the crime was death , for fourteen years . Those agreeing to transport convicts could sell them as servants . From London prisons , especially Newgate and the Old Bailey , large numbers were sent forth , the latter alone supplying not far from to , 000 between 1717 and 1775 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zo , 000 felons were imported into that colony before the Revolution . At least nine of the colonies are known to have received felons as servants , so that the total number sent was not far from 5o , o0o . Lists of felons ordered transported were often printed in the Gentleman 's Magazine ; one of May , 1747 , numbering 887 . Remembering this , perhaps , Dr. Johnson said in 1769 , " Sir , they are a race of convicts , and ought to be content with anything we may allow them short of hanging . " The colonists became alarmed as early as 1670 . At that date Virginia passed an act prohibiting the importation of convicts . The preamble speaks " of the great number of felons and other desperate villains sent hither from the several prisons of England . " Later , communications which appeared in the newspapers show great indignation . One writer speaks of the practice as a " vile importation " and comments particularly on the bad moral effects of such persons . Even at an earlier date Lord Bacon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as follows : " It is a shameful and unblessed thing to take the scum of people and wicked , condemned men to be the people with whom you plant . " And Benjamin Franklin , in reply to the arguments of British authorities that it was necessary to get rid of convicts , asked whether Americans for the same reason would be justified in sending their rattlesnakes to England ! For a brief period Great Britain listened to the complaints of the colonists , confirmed the Virginia Act of 1670 , and made it apply to other colonies . But in 1718 Parliament in effect repealed it by the act of that date mentioned above , and throughout the eighteenth century convicts were a never-failing source of supply for white servants . In this connection it has been suggested that American genealogists in search of missing data to complete their family tree would find a rich mine of unexplored material in the archives of Newgate and Old Bailey , the latter tilling one hundred and ten manuscript volumes ! The reasons for sending so many conYoe cxxvii ? No 761-93victs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly anxious to rid herself of this class of her population . Criminals were not only unproductive , but entailed a great expense on the country . Economists urged their transportation , while others argued that in a new country many criminals would forsake their old habits and become good citizens . Some of the colonists were certainly not averse to convicts as servants , since their term of service was longer . The committee of trade for New York even petitioned the authorities , 1693 , to send them all the prisoners who were to be transported from Newgate . It should be remembered , too , that the word felon in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries conveyed a different meaning from that at present . The penal code of England in 1600 provided a death penalty for four hundred offenses , many of which were of a trivial nature , and even lust before the American Revolution Blackstone states that there were one hundred and fifty capital crimes . Thus many persons called " felons " were less objectionable as servants than might be supposed , and there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when transported . One of the most interesting sources of supply was kidnapping . The profits gained by such practices were so great that this developed as a regular business in London and seaport towns like Bristol . " Spirits " would pounce on all classes of persons and entice them on hoard ships bound for the colonies , and even children were induced to go by offers of sweetmeats . The county court records of Middlesex give evidence of this practice . A record for Nov. 7 , 1655 , states that Dorothy Perkins accuses Christian Chacrert , alias Sacrett , " for a Spirit , one that taketh upp men and women and children and sells them on a shipp to bee conveyed beyond the sea , having enticed and inveagled one Edward Furnifull and Anne his wife with her infant to the waterside and put them aboard the shipp called The Planter to be conveyed to Virginia . " Parliament passed an act in 1671 providing a death penalty for this crime . Analogous to the spirits were the " newlanders , " or " soul-sellers . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developed this class of agents , who traveled up and down the Rhine valley , persuading peasants to sell their belongings and migrate to the colonies . They pretended that they were rich merchants from Philadelphia , dressed in costly clothes , and wore wigs and ruffles . They would seek acquaintance with a merchant in Holland and agree with him upon a sum for every person persuaded to remove . They described Pennsylvania as a land of Elysian fields flowing with milk and honey , where gold and silver could be picked up on the hills , and servants could become independent and live like noblemen . The simple German peasant would often sell his belongings and trust himself to the mercy of the soul-seller . Many were forced to become servants by indenture , because the excessive charges imposed for transportation from the Rhine valley to the port of departure used up their small capital . The voyage over often repeated the horrors of the famous " middle passage " of slavery fame . An average cargo was three hundred , but the shipmaster , for greater profit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small vessel . Picture to yourself several hundred people of all ages with only six feet by two allotted between-decks for one adult person , with no privacy whatever , wearing the same clothing for the whole voyage ? from four weeks to four months or even more ? and often lying flat For whole days at a time when the ship was tossed by terrific storms . Imagine the vile atmosphere in an unventilated space containing hundreds of people , many ill with all manner of contagious diseases , living and dead side by side , without medical attendance , moaning and shrieking , praying and crying , and perhaps crazed by famine and thirst . John Harrower , an indentured servant , describing in his diary a scene between-decks during a storm , says , " There was some sleeping . some darning , some blasting their leggs and thighs , some their liver , lungs , lights , and eyes , and for to make the scene the odder , some curs 'd Father , Mother , Sister , Brother . " When food ran short it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . Mittelberger , an eyewitness , says that spoiled biscuit were given the passengers , " dirty and full of red worms and spiders ' nests . " When such vile stuff called food was lacking , rats and mice were eaten . The mortality under such circumstances was tremendous , sometimes more than half of the passengers dying of hunger and privation . Children from one to seven rarely survived . Mittelberger says he saw thirty-two little children thrown into the ocean during one voyage . It must be remembered , of course , that a safe , short passage of thirty days was not uncommon . Still , conditions were so terrible that several colonies passed laws regulating food , the number of passengers to be carried , and care of the sick . Philadelphia and other ports were exposed to constant dangers from contagious diseases . Sickness continued after landing , so that much legislation was necessary respecting quarantine , inspection of vessels , and the building of pest-houses . When the vessel finally made her port , no one was permitted to leave unless the passage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fared worst , the very ' ones whose misery ought to have been relieved first . Parents were forced to sell their children to service , perhaps never to see them again . Husband and wife were often separated . Children under five were sometimes given away to serve until they were twenty-one . " Soul-drivers " would purchase fifty or more servants from the captain of one of these ships , and drive them through the country like a drove of cattle , offering them for sale to the highest bidder . They were protected in part , however , first by their indenture , which specified the term of service , lodging , food , and apparel ; and , second , by " freedom dues , " which were provided for by law , and included such things as clothing , corn , a gun , and sometimes a fifty-acre tract of land . Most of the servants were unskilled laborers , though many artisans and some in the professions bound themselves to service . The following advertisement in the Virginia Gazette for March a8 , I77-1 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived at Leedstown , the Ship Justitia , with about one Hundred Healthy Servants . Men , Women and Boys , among which are many Tradesmen ? viz , Blacksmiths , Shoemakers , Tailors , House Carpenters and Joiners , A Cooper , a Bricklayer and Plaisterer , a Painter , a Watchmaker and Glaizer , several Silversmiths , Weavers , a Jeweler , and many others . The Sale will Commence on Tuesday , the ad of April , at Leeds Town on Rappahannock River . A Reasonable Credit will be allowed , giving Bond with Approved Security to The advertisements for runaway servants are numerous , give descriptions of their appearance and dress , mention little peculiarities , and bring before us vividly the personality of these servants . Richard Kinnersley , an English servant-man , had " a pretty long visage of a lightish complexion , and thin-flaxen hair ; his eye tooth sticks out over his lower teeth in a very remarkable manner . " James Murphy , an Irish servant-schoolmaster , was " somewhat long visaged , with sharp nose , much pitted with the small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hair behind with a string , a very proud fellow , loves drink and when drunk is very impudent and talkative , pretends much , and knows little , was sometime in the French service and can talk French . " Then there was the fat pock-broken tailor with a " hard look , " the carpenter who wore his own black hair , the convict servant-woman who could knit and spin , the shoemaker and fiddler who " loves to be at frolicks and taverns and is apt to get in liquor and when so is subject to fits . " The variety of dress was astonishing . We read of cinnamon- colored vests , blue , green , and yellow coats , with brass buttons , and breeches with silk puffs . Shoes were of all styles , square-toed and pecked - toed , with buckles and without . An Irish runaway servant-man , Daniel Macdonald , had " a double-breasted cape-coat , with white metal buttons , a little flowered on the top , an ozenbrigs shirt , tow-linen trousers , and an old jacket of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had no stockings except he stole them . " The general character of the servants varied in different colonies according tothe class from which they came . Of course , not much could be expected of the criminal classes . On the other hand , there were honest artisans and German peasants , seeking a new home for wife and children . The runaway servants represented the worst element , and frequently had stolen horses , clothing , or silver . One was described as " so prodigious a lycr that if observed he may easily be discovered . " A tract published in London in 17oS , entitled " The Sot Weed Factor or a Voyage to Maryland , " is a poem by a tobacco agent , Ebenezer Cook , describing the manners and customs of the ruder elements of Maryland society at this date . In picturing a coarse group of female servants who had gathered about the fireside to play games , he says : " To fire-side I did repair ; Near which a jolly Female Crew , Were deep engag 'd at Lanctre-Lone ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are scarce in England seen ; I thought them first some Witches bent , On Black Designs in dire Convent . ? ? ? " We scarce had play 'd a Round shout , But that these Indian Foes fell out. ? D ? m you , says one , tho ' now so brave , I knew you late a Four-Years Slave ; What if for Planter 's Wife you go , Nature designed you for the Hoe . " The main work of the servant was to clear the land and cultivate the crop , though artisans , of course , worked at their trades . Boucher asserts that two-thirds of the persons employed as schoolmasters in Maryland just before the Revolution were either indentured servants or convicts . A letter from ' Washington 's overseer complains of the fact that his servants were difficult to manage because of a liking for liquor . The " Sot Weed Factor " makes one of the female servants " who passed for a chamber maid " speak thus : " In better Times , e'er to this Land I was unhappily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As any Lord or Lady here , Not then a Slave for twice two Year . My cloaths were fashonably new , Nor were my Shifts of Linnen Blue ; But things are changed , now at the Hoe , I daily work , and Barefoot go , In weeding Corn or feeding Swine , I spend my melancholy Time . Kidnap 'd and Fourth I thither fled , To Shun a hated Nuptial Bed , And to my cost already find , Worse Plagues than those I left behind . " Interesting phases of the institution of white servitude appear in the laws regulating their status . Unlike the slave , the white servant could bring suit for justice . The court could order his freedom or lessen his term of service . It could require the master to provide the servant with medical attendance , see that freedom dues were paid , and that he had sufficient food and clothing . On the other hand , his time belonged to his master , and severe work could he exacted . His privileges and freedom of movement were restricted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . lie could be whipped for disobedience . He was not allowed to buy or sell anything without leave . Tavern-keepers could not entertain him or sell him liquor . He could neither marry without his master 's consent , nor could he vote or hold office , but he could be sold or seized to satisfy an outstanding debt . The treatment and condition of servants varied widely in different colonies and at different periods , depending on the nature of the work and the character of the servant and the master . In general , their treatment was better in New England and the middle colonies than in the Southern . Harrowing tales of cruelty and abuse of white servants are common , but the same kind of treatment was meted out to servants in England during this period . In the court records of Middlesex County , England , 1673. we find that Thomas Tooner was cited to answer to the charge of inhumanly beating his female servant with knotted whip-cords , so that " the poor servant is a lamentable spectacle to behold . " The lash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Eddis , writing in 1769-77 , declares that servants in Maryland groaned beneath a worse than Egyptian bondage . Runaway servants were severely punished , and elaborate laws were passed to secure their arrest and punish all who aided them to freedom . Some perplexing moral problems w ere caused by white servants . The question of intermarriage between servant and slave arose , as well as that of restraining looser relations between these classes . Nearly all the colonies were forced to pass laws to prevent such relations between servants , between free men and servants , and between negro slaves and servants . A great increase of illegitimate mulatto children in the eighteenth century is one evidence of low moral standards . In Virginia the parish vestry books record large sums expended for the support of such children . Laws were passed to prevent intermarriage of black and white . For example , the preamble of the Virginia Act of 1691 states that it w as enacted " for the prevention of that abominable and spurious mixture which hereafter may increase in this dominion as well by negroes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlawful intercourse with one another . " A Maryland act provided that the children of a servant-woman re-sultin from intermarriage with a negro slave should be slaves to her master for life . landed aristocracy in the South , because he made possible the cultivation of extensive areas of land . But in the course of a few years he became a free citizen and owner of a small estate . Thus was developed a yeoman class , a much-needed democratic element in the Southern colonies , while at the same time settlers were secured for the back-lands , where they were needed to protect the frontier . Nevertheless , they did not form a distinct class after becoming freedmen . Some were doubtless the progenitors of the " poor white trash " of the South , but it is likely that environment rather than birth was the main factor in producing this class . While comparatively few rose to prominence , yet there are some notable examples to the contrary . Two signers of the Declaration of Independence , George Taylor and Math- ew Thornton ; Charles Thompson , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Revolutionary War fame , had all been white servants . It is certain also that many became successful planters , and perhaps the majority respectable and desirable citizens . On the whole , the effects of the institution were beneficial . Great Britain was relieved of her undesirable citizens ; many German peasants were given the opportunity to better their condition ; the colonies were supplied with laborers for the rougher work , and servant-artisans supplied wants impossible to meet in any other way . That the white servant was useful , even after the Revolution , is seen by the fact that large numbers continued to come to Pennsylvania , where the institution existed until 1831 . By that time various causes were leading to its abolition . Opposition developed in Europe because of the drain of the labor supply to America . In the South the negro slave had tended to supplant the white servant , while in the North labor-saving machinery was doing so much of his work that he was no longer needed .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
