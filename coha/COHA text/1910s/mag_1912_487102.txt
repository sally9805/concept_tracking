In the very active discussion concerning the construction and usages of the Elizabethan stage which has been in progress during the last ten years or so , the author of the present work has taken a prominent part , and students of the drama will welcome this ingathering of his most important contributions to this thorny subject . The first article is the best summary yet published of our information in regard to the stage conditions of the time ; the remaining articles deal with special questions , as appears from their titles " The Situation - of the Lords ' Room , " " Title and Locality Boards on the Pre-Restoration Stage , " " Music and Song in the Elizabethan Theatre , " etc The chronological list of Elizabethan playhouses at the end of the first article was printed before the announcement of Professor Feuillerat 's discoveries in the Loseley MSS , and accordingly requires correction in regard to Blackfriars , which , under its earliest management , we now know to have been the third in date of the Elizabethan theatres . Fortunately , before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Datly Chronicle a preliminary communication embracing the main points of his discoveries , so that at the end of his work Mr. Lawrence has been able to give us a discussion of these matters . In this final article we note especially the proof of the occasional employment of multiple setting ( in certain dramas of Lyly 's ) on the Black- , friars stage , also a suggested explanation as to the origin of the puzzling term " private " which came to be applied to that theatre , as to some other Elizabethan theatres According to this view , Farrant , who was the first to give dramatic performances in the old monastic building of Blackfriars ( in 1577 ) , evaded - the " Act of Common Council " for the regulation of acting within the city by living himself on the premises and avoiding the collection of money at the theatre itself . By pursuing this course , he could call these performances " private " and so escape the penalties of the above-mentioned act Hunnis , the next manager , was able to throw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " private house " stuck to the place , and was later on applied to still other theatres whose stage conditions and terms of admission were similar . In connection with these Blackfriars matters , one is surprised to find Mr. Lawrence . earlier in the volume , accepting without question Professor Wallace 's theory that this theatre in the period of its greatest importance  --  under the management of Evans wassubsidized by the Queen . As regards the author 's general views concerning the Elizabethan stage , one may say that he is altogether uninfluenced by recent writers who are inclined to claim for Elizabethan staging a larger element of pictorial illusion than was once thought possible , and who in other respects minimize to a certain extent the archaic features of the stage of the period . So far as the public theatres are concerned , we have no doubt that Mr. Lawrence is right . The stage in such theatres was essentially a platform stage and so afforded little opportunity for pictorial effects . To be sure , there was a rear stage , hut , as Prof. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convenience would require that where there were two stages ( to say nothing of the third one aloft ) , the acting should be mainly on the front stage , which fact excludes pictorial illusion as an element of any importance . It seems to us , however , different with the so-called private theatres , from which , and not from the public theatres , the modern theatre is undoubtedly nescended In these cases the stage did not project out into the middle of the audience , and the conditions from the first invited more elaborate furnishings and to a certain degree scenic illusion Neither Lawrence nor Reynolds appears to consider the possible influence of court performances on the staging of the private theatres , at least The documents relating to the Office of Revels , published some years ago by Feuillerat , show that the staging in court plays was as elaborate as anything known to our modern Shakespeare " revivals , " and hence it is natural that this same French scholar , in his more recent treatise , " Le Bureau des Menus-Plaisirs et la raise en @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should ask whether Shakespeare , after having seen one of his plays , e. g. , " Love 's Labor 's Lost , " acted in this manner , would not be likely to seek an improvement of his own stage in the same direction , as far as the resources of his company permitted Among the conclusions relating to the Elizabethan stage which the author ar rives , at in this volume , we note the following : That the title of the play of the day was commonly announced on a board set up in sight of the audience , but that boards indicating the locality of the scene were only sparingly used Indeed , the Elizabethans did not shrink from wholly unlocated scenes . Furthermore , there were normally intervals be , tween acts , though brief ; inter-act song , dance , and even music seem confined , however , to the private theatres  --  only in regard to music were there occasional exceptions . Mr. Lawrence lays stress , moreover , on the multiple or simultaneous setting , which was common on the court stage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Middle Ages . Feuillerat had already recognized this principle , but by neglecting it , R Warwick Bond , the editor of Lyly , has seriously misrepresented the staging of that writer 's plays . We have only touched on the more important articles in the work before us , but there are a number of others , like that on the mounting of masques in the reign of Charles I , the early history of French players in England , which deserve attention The volume is beautifully printed , and its value is enhanced by a series of admirable illustrations . Israel Zangwili 's play , " The Next Re1.gion , " which was treated with a good deal of deference by the English critics when it was produced in London some months ago , now appears in book form ( Macmillan ) , but 1 , , not likely to prove more impressive in print than it did upon the stage It contains much witty and satirical writing , several effective situations of a dramatic and pathetic kind , some vigorous assaults upon dogmatic theology , but is strangely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evident sincerity of purpose , without which a work of this kind can have no substantial value That it should offer nothing new in the way of argument on one side or the other is not particularly surprising , for the themes chosen for discussion have been debated along almost every imaginable line , but the fact that it might have been written by an agnostic , a Hebrew , or a professing Christian constitutes a serious dramatic and artistic defect . Mr Zangwill 's hero is- a liberal-minded clergyman of the Protestant Episcopal Church  --  the story , though ingenious , calls for no detailed analysis  --  who has lost all faith in his professional creed , and even in the possibility of a future existence Being honest , he refuses to cherish his flock upon fond delusions , resigns his post , and starts out as the prophet of a new religion , based on the facts of science and aiming at the establishment of a heaven upon earth through the agency of brotherly love and universal altruistic endeavor , By the aid of an agnostical millionaire , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sumptuous ritual of his own invention , which attracts crowds . He is encouraged to believe that his most comprehensive ideals are about to be realized , when his only son , whom he had trained to be his successor . is murdered by a crazy fanatic . His stoical faith in his own convictions is proof even against this blow , but his wife , a religious devotee , who has followed his fortunes with self-sacrificing fidelity , rebels when he denies to his dead son the hope of resurrection , and , although he remains steadfast , the play ends upon a note of triumphant evangelical inspiration In her case , at least  --  and from first to last she is the theatrical antidote to herhusband 's chill philosophy  --  the next religion is a hollow fallacy Possibly Mr Zangwill meant to imply that woman 's faith is less intellectual and more emotional than man 's , or that superstition is proof against the light of reason , or that the craving after immortality is deeply rooted in human nature Or , again , he may have wished to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A fable capable of so many interpretations is of small account in the theatre . Moreover , the play , with all its cleverness and occasional eloquence , is often shallow , tricky , and theatrical , and in places ill-informed Some of the dogmas ascribed to modern Episcopalianism are utterly fantastic Mr Zangwill evidently knows little of the elasticity of the later theology . Even the arguments of his skeptics are sadly old-fashioned No sutor supra crepidant is a proverb of which a scholar should be heedful , and even in the heat of argument the skilful disputant will hesitate to wound the religious susceptibilities of his opponent . Some of Mr Zangwill 's utterances may or may not be pertinent , but they are in execrable taste Such raw crudity defeats its own object One of the most flagrant sins recently committed in the way of dramatic adaptation is Porter Emerson Browne 's transformation of the " Chains " of Elizabeth Baker , produced in the Criterion Theatre The original piece attracted much attention in London , as a study of the hopeless condition of millions of the lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corporation , feels that he is doomed to lifelong servitude , without any hope of independence , and longs to emigrate to some newer country where his energies may have wider scope But his wife , whom he can not afford to take with him , and all her relatives oppose his desire bitterly Finally he decides to get away secretly , but he learns that his wife will soon be a mother , and he , therefore , abandons all idea of escape and resigns himself to a life-time of dreary routine These domestic and social responsibilities are the chains , according to Miss Baker , which bind men to slavery . Mr Browne 's comedy , purporting to be founded upon Miss Baker 's , is a clumsy travesty of it , with an inverted moral . The conversion of the characters into Americans , with a corresponding change of scene , inevitably plays havoc with the quality and design of a piece dealing exclusively with British conditions , but the climax of Mr. Browne 's artistic offence is that , for the sake of a happy ending , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the impending birth the beginning of a new era of happiness , instead of  --  as the author intended  --  a crowning calamity Moreover , he has vulgarized a serious work by much trite and foolish humor The philosophy of Miss Baker 's play is not , perhaps , impregnable , but thatis no reason why it should be exposed to such utter misrepresentation . Next season Mabel Taliaferro and her sister , Edith Taliaferro , will be joint stars under the management of Joseph Brooks They will be seen early in September in New York in a drama now being written for them According to a statistician , there have been since 1875 no fewer than 171 women composers in the larger forms . The number of women who compose songs and piano ? pie  --  es is not given The number of pianos imported last year into the United Kingdom was 18,508 , valued at $2,733,712 .

At the conclusion of the London Philharmonic Society 's last concert , in the course of which Mr Harold Bauer played the solo part of Beethoven 's concerto in G major and subsequently Brahms 's " Walzer " ( op 39 ) , the artist was presented , at a gathering of the members of the Society , with the Beethoven gold medal . Mr J C Ames made the presentation on behalf of the committee , and Mr. Bauer , in returning thanks , told how deeply he was moved by having attained the ambition of his boyhood .
