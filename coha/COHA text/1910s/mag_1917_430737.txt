Why have we failed to equip our Navy with enough of these efficient and economical loth Century weapons ? England has for centuries owed the security of her national existence to her control of the seas ? and England has stopped building battleships and is building under-sea boats and merchant vessels by the hundreds . It is epochal . Britain , who for the sake of her very life has long been forced to maintain naval supremacy , has at last found that in order to continue mistress of the seas she must abandon plans for super-dreadnoughts and battle-cruisers and devote herself exclusively to commerce carriers and submarines . France has done the same . Russia likewise . And authentic reports from Germany say her U-Boat fleet is not under i , 000 . All the belligerents have had the lesson driven home to them : an inexpensive submarine , manned by a crew of but 25 , can send the costliest battleship to the bottom in two minutes ? with its entire complement of 1,500 men . England 's problem , however , is not our own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases . For we have three miles of seacoast to her one , and our lack of colonies allows us a naval concentration of which she is incapable . The problems with us are not what to do and how to do it , but how speedily and how efficiently and how economically we can do it Clearly the continued construction of super- dreadnoughts and battle cruisers is neither tl-e speediest not tl-e ellirientest nor the - cost economical way . Up to a certain limit , these huge floating fortresses ( a single one of them requires three years to build and houses a power plant greater than that which drives all of New York 's subways ) are a good investment for Uncle Sam . But we have more than reached that point . If the big Naval Bill is ever completed , we will be prodigally supplied with these Goliaths of the seas . But this modern David , this youth with the might of navies , the submarine ? that is what we want . A dreadnought requires three years to build . A submarine , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five months . Moreover , a dreadnought costs about $19,000,00C and a battle-cruiser $22,000,000 , whereas from 15 to 25 submarines can be constructed for those figures , according to their size and power . And one submarine carries in itself the destruction of a dozen of the most costly men-of-war . A single modern under-sea boat could send to the bottom in twenty minutes $200,000,000 worth of Invincibles and Invulnerables . It is a well-known fact that many of our ships are still under-manned . Some of them are even temporarily out of the service because crews for them have not been yet obtained . The trouble is that these huge vessels of modern navies require whole communities to operate them . Nearly all battleships man the best part of a thousand men apiece , and the latest super-dreadnought and battle-cruisers man a thousand and a half . Think of it ! Fifteen hundred men on board a single ship that cost $22,000,000 and required three years to build ? and the ship torpedoed and sunk in two minutes by a tiny torpedo from a submarine with a crew of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S i , 600,000 , and requires less than four months from the day the keel is laid to the day she hits the water . There is economy for you ? economy of time , of material , and of men . WAR TEACHES QUICKLY For years America had cried Preparedness . East and West had outdone each other in championing it . The press had fairly seethed with it . We had heard talk of increasing the Army , of expanding the Navy , of universal training , and so forth and so on ? until we no longer knew where we stood or for what we stood . Everybody seemed to want something different !  | Meanwhile the Middle -- West had refused utterly to join the discussion . It was busy raising crops and selling them to the Allies , and was n't interested . Eastern and Western congressmen warned and threatened , but they might as well have talked to hills of beans . Then something changed the whole situation . The European War came . Everybody knows what happened next . Things snapped shut like a steel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cotton became a drug on the market . Wheat could n't find a buyer . Ruin stared farmers and middlemen and dealers in the face . What was the reason ? The sea lanes were closed ! Then something else happened . The Middle-West began shouting Preparedness . They literally howled for it . They had been made aware at last what sea-power meant . They wanted a merchant marine to carry their crops across the Atlantic and Pacific . They wanted a Navy , to see that their crops got safely to their destination . And they wanted these things right away . They were in a terrible hurry . They were losing as much money each twenty-four hours by embargo as England and France were spending to wage the War . Suddenly something still stranger happened . Stock exchanges opened again . Ship sailings were resumed . Cotton soared . Wheat skyrocketed . Prosperity fairly burst upon farmers and middlemen and dealers , dispelling all thought of ruin . What was the reason ? The sea lanes were open ! Sea-power ? that is the magic word which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sent pouring into the country a flood of gold . A great Navy was patrolling the lanes of the seas , keeping sub- marines and commerce raiders away . Not our Navy ? England 's Navy . No very flattering thought , is it ? But it is something to be exceedingly thankful for ! Yet circumstances are not always going to be such that the British sea-lion will roar for us . No self-respecting citizen would have them so . And there are a lot of self-respecting citizens in our country . Some of them are in Congress . The Middle-West has its quota . So when the Middle-West woke up , Congress woke up ? emphatically . Very emphatically ! It jumped right out of an uneasy sleep and landed on both feet with a billion-dollar thud . Landed with the biggest naval budget the country ever has voted . This vast sum , when the program is complete ( including ten battleships , six battle cruisers , ten scout cruisers , fifty torpedo-boat destroyers , sixty-eight submarines , two gunboats , and twelve auxiliary craft ) will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vessels , of various types . Quite an army of ships . Their total displacement is 813,000 tons . Add this to our 1915 naval strength of 436 ships ? with a combined displacement of 1,317,000 tons , making 592 ships with a grand displacement of 2,130,000 tons ? and it would seem that our sea strength were indeed formidable . But just a moment . The building program authorized by Congress at its last session can not possibly be completed until 1921 , and by that time a heavy normal depreciation will have taken place in our present personnel , even provided there are no battle losses . Moreover , the Atlantic fleet , although unquestionably a first class fighting machine , is seriously hampered by lack of submarines , and other auxiliary vessels ? such as provision ships , hospital ships , fuel ships , mine layers , mine sweepers , etc . The Pacific fleet , which consists largely of small cruisers , is hampered even more seriously and could not hold out long against a modern enemy squadron . While the Asiatic fleet , a bric-a-brac shop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fighting machine at all . Unmolested , it serves well its purpose of looking after American interests in the Far East . But an up-to-date hos- tile destroyer force could sink it like so many cardboard boats upon a dish-pan sea . Thus it becomes evident that our paper naval strength of 2,130,000 tons must be taken with a pinch of salt . With a whole shaker-full ! For not only will its fighting force never , unless we take further steps , be much over half its listed tonnage ? or a maximum of 1,065,000 tons ? but by the time 1921 comes around it will be found that still further depreciations have taken place . Assume for the moment , however , that we were really to have 2,130,000 tons of battle fleets four years hence . Where would we be with regard to the other great nations ? In 1914 , England had a naval displacement of 2,713,756 tons , and Germany one of 1,304,640 tons . What these two powers now have in the way of fighting tonnage , in spite of their losses , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will have by 1921 , Heaven alone knows ? though they have both stopped building battleships , and are confining themselves solely to submarines and armed merchant ships . And the biggest part of the work is ? submarines ! GETTING DOWN TO BUSINESS We are at war . Let us get down to dollars and cents . Let us put Preparedness on a business basis . What corporation would last a year if it undertook to run its affairs as the United States Government does ? Would the Standard Oil Company , The Bethlehem Steel Corporation , the Pennsylvania Railroad System , the Ford Automobile Concern , ever have reared their monuments to modern industrial organization if they had kept books like Uncle Sam ? Not much ! Do we want to go right on paying $400,000,000 a year for our Navy ? No ! Not only do we fail to fall in with the idea from a can-we-afford-it standpoint , but we veto it as a scheme crassly lacking in the qualities of good business . On the other hand , do we want to abandon the idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The solution of the problem is ? submarines ! Because  | they are economical to build . Because they are economical to operate . I ; cause they are the last note in modern naval efficiency . They have revolutionized warfare . There should be ten submarine bases on the Atlantic Coast and ten on the Pacific , at strategic points ; and each base should have a complement of twenty submarines of various types , including mine-layers . This would make 400 . Then , the great fighting ships of our fleets , in conjunction with our Allies , should be backed up by two submarines apiece . This would require another 200 , making 600 in all . And lastly a final loo should be distributed among our outlying possessions , dependencies , and interests ? the Philippines , Hawaii , the American West Indies , the Panama Canal . This would make 700 . What are they going to cost us ? Well , as the price of submarines runs from $60o,000 to $1,60o,000 per vessel , according to whether they are of the coast-defence or fleet type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the coastdefence type , graded by size and speed and torpedo capacity . And we need 400 of these to protect our coasts . Therefore , let us secure 200 of the largest type of this variety , which cost $1,300,000 apiece , and 100 of each of the other two , which cost respectively S$oo , 000 and $60o,000 ? at a total outlay of $400,000,000 . Then let the rest of the 700 be of the fleet type , which , with its additional size , speed , torpedo capacity , armament , cruising radius , etc. , is ideally adapted for cooperation with our super-dreadnought and battlecruiser fleets , and for guarding our outlying interests . This type of sub-surface boat costs $1,60o,000 per vessel . Thus 300 of them will amount to S48o,000,000 . Add this to the $400,000,000 which was the cost of the 400 coast-defence vessels , and the grand total becomes $88o,000,000 . A lot of money ? Yes , but not so much as Congress has saddled us to for naval purposes in the 1916-1918 Naval Bill , not so much as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year or so , not so much as is spent for alcohol and tobacco every year ? and not so much as the stoppage of commerce would amount to in a single month , provided some  | unlucky turn in the war should cause a repetition of those um forgotten days of July and August , 1914 ? with no English fleet to help us . A lot of money ? Yes , but it is a bill you pay and are through with , which can by no means be said of the recent dreadnought building program , as I have already explained . For the point is this : A submarine costs very little beyond the original outlay . The crew is small , the fuel expense is slight , the depreciation is low . At the very maximum , taking all possible expenses into consideration , the future outlay per vessel per annum would not exceed S1oo,000 . Multiply that by 700 , the total number of submarines , and the figure is 570,000,000  - -  the total yearly expense our under-sea boat squadrons would possibly be to us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the other hand , take the case of a big-ship program , where the yearly upkeep per vessel is $3,000,000 . For a fleet of loo dreadnoughts and battlecruisers , the annual drain on our pocketbooks even after the first heavy outlay would be something like $200,000,000 . Compare that with the figures above . Then there is the matter of men . A fleet of Too battleships of the newest type would require a complement of 1,500 men apiece , or 150,000 men in all . Whereas a fleet of 700 submarines manning a crew of 25 men apiece would require only 17,500 men ? or less than an eighth as many . And to carry the comparison one step further , a fleet of 700 up-todate battleships would cost $14,000,000,000 to build , $1,400 , - 000,000 per annum to keep in commission , and would require a crew of 1,050,000 men ! Mr. Taxpayer , there are the figures . And we are engaged in what will probably be a long war . What are we going to do ? Are we going to take steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go on building terrifically costly super-dreadnoughts and battle-cruisers ? Or are we going to do neither the one thing nor the other , but sit tight and await the possibility of disaster ? It is up to you . Mr. Taxpayer .  |
