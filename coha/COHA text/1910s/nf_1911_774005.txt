txt 60 English Seamen in the Sixteenth Century pursued their melancholy way . They parted company . The Judith , being the better sailer , arrived first , and reached Plymouth in December , torn and tattered . Drake rode off post immediately to carry the bad news to London . The Minion 's fate was worse . She made her course through the Bahama Channel , her crow ( lying as if struck with a pestilence , till at last there were hardly men enough left to handle the sails . They fell too far south for England , and at length had to put into Vigo , where their probable fate would be a Spanish prison . Happily they found other English vessels in the roads there . Fresh hands were put on board , and fresh provisions . With these supplies Hawkins reached Mount 's Bay a month later than the Judith , in January 1569 . Drake had told the story , and all England was ringing with it . Englishmen always think their own countrymen are in the right . The Spaniards , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accused of abominable treachery . The splendid fight which Hawkins had made raised him into a national idol , and though he had suffered financially , his loss was made up in reputation and authority . Every privateer in the West was eager to serve under the leadership of the hero of San Juan de TJlloa . He speedily found himself in command of a largo irregular squadron , and even ( ' evil recognised his consequence . His chief and constant anxiety was for the comrades whom be had left behind , and he talked of a new expedition to recover them , or &I; John Hawkins and Philip //l r S. , , , 41 l i t revenge them if they had been killed ; but all things had to wait . They probably found means of communicating with him , and as long as there was no Inquisition in Mexico , he may have learnt that there was no immediate occasion for action . Elizabeth put a brave face on her disappointment . She knew that she was surrounded with treason , but she knew also that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alva 's money , and was less than ever inclined to restore it . She had the best of the bargain in the arrest of the Spanish and English ships and cargoes . Alva would not encourage Philip to declare war with England till the Netherlands were completely reduced , and Philip , with his leaden foot ( pie de plomo ) , always preferred patience and intrigue . Time and he and the Pope were three powers which in the end , he thought , would prove irresistible , and indeed it seemed , after Hawkins 's return , as if Philip would turn out to be right . The presence of the Queen of Scots in England had set in flame the Catholic nobles . The wages of Alva 's troops had been wrung somehow out of the wretched Provinces , and his supreme ability and inexorable resolution were steadily grinding down the revolt . Every port in Holland and Zealand was in Alva 's hands . Elizabeth 's throne was undermined by the Ridolfi conspiracy , the most dangerous which she had ever had to encounter . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be entirely depended on was in the privateer fleet , sail62 English Seamen in the Sixteenth Century ing , most of them , under a commission from the Prince of Orange . This fleet was the strangest phenomenon in naval history . It was half Dutch , half English , with a flavour of Huguenot , and was commanded by a Flemish noble , Count de la Mark . Its headquarters were in the Downs or Dover Roads , where it could watch the narrow seas , and seize every Spanish ship that passed which was not too strong to be meddled with . The cargoes taken were openly sold in Dover market . If the Spanish ambassador is to be believed in a complaint which he addressed to Cecil , Spanish gentlemen taken prisoners were set 111 ) to public auction there for the ransom which they would fetch , and were disposed of for one hundred pounds each . If Alva sent cruisers from Antwerp to burn them out , they retreated under the guns of Dover Castle . Roving squadrons of them flew down to the Spanish coasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the captains drank success to piracy at their banquets out of chalices . The Spanish merchants at last estimated the property destroyed at three million ducats , and they said that if their flag could no longer protect them , they must decline to make further contracts for the supply of the Netherlands army . It was life or death to Elizabeth . The Ridolfi plot , an elaborate and far-reaching conspiracy to give her crown to Mary Stuart and to make away with heresy , was all but complete . The Pope and Sh John Hawkins and Philip Uir &(; H ( / f.3 Philip had approved ; Alva was to invade ; the Duke of Norfolk was to head an insurrection iii the Eastern Counties . Never had she been in greater danger . Elizabeth was herself to be murdered . The intention was known , but the particulars of the conspiracy had been kept so secret that she had not evidence enough to take measures to protect herself . The privateers at Dover were a sort of protection ; they would at least make Alva 's crossing more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the details of the treason . Nothing was to be gained by concession ; the only salvation was in daring . At Antwerp there was a certain Doctor Story , maintained by Alva there to keep a watch on English heretics . Story had been a persecutor under Mary , and had defended heretic burning in Elizabeth 's first Parliament . He had refused the oath of allegiance , had left the country , and had taken to treason . Cecil wanted evidence , and this man he knew could give it . A pretended informer brought Story word that there was an English vessel in the Scheldt which he would find worth examining . Story was tempted on board . The hatches were closed over him . He was delivered two days after at the Tower , when his secrets were squeezed out of him by the rack and he was then hanged . Something was learnt , but less still than Cecil needed to take measures to protect the Queen . And now once more , and in a new character , we are to 64 English Seamen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had passed since the catastrophe at San Juan de Ulloa . He had learnt to his sorrow that his poor companions had fallen into the hands of the Holy Office at last ; had been burnt , lashed , starved in dungeons or worked in chains in the Seville yards ; and his heart , not a very tender one , bled at the thoughts of them . The finest feature in the seamen of those days was their devotion to one another . Hawkins determined that , one way or other , these old comrades of his should be rescued . Entreaties were useless ; force was impossible . There might still be a chance with cunning . He would risk anything , even the loss of his soul , to save them . De Silva had left England . The Spanish ambassador was now Don Guerau or Gerald de Espes , and to him had fallen the task of watching and directing the conspiracy . Philip was to give the signal , the Duke of Norfolk and other Catholic peers were to rise and proclaim the Queen of Scots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in England itself ; and the ambassador 's business was to welcome and encourage all symptoms of discontent . Hawkins know generally what was going on , and he saw in it an opportunity of approaching Philip on his weak side . having been so much in the Canaries , he probably spoke Spanish fluently . He called on Don Guerau , and with audacious coolness represented that he and many of his friends were dissatisfied with the Queen 's service . Ho said he had found her Sir John Hawkins and Philip the 8 , ru ) nl f ; : ) faithless and ungrateful , and he and they would gladly transfer their allegiance to the King of Spain , if the King of Spain would receive them . For himself , he would undertake to bring over the whole privateer fleet of the West , and in return he asked for nothing but the release of a few poor English seamen who were in prison at Seville . Don Guerau was full of the belief that the whole nation was ready to rebel . He eagerly swallowed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alva , he wrote to Philip 's secretary , Cayas , expatiating on the importance of securing such an addition to their party . It was true , he admitted , that Hawkins had been a pirate , but piracy was a common fault of the English , and no wonder when . the Spaniards submitted to being plundered so meekly ; the man who was offering his services was bold , resolute , capable , and had great influence with the English sailors ; he strongly advised that such a recruit should be encouraged . Alva would not listen . Philip , who shuddered at the very name of Hawkins , was incredulous . Don Guerau had to tell Sir John that the King at present declined his offer , but advised him to go himself to Madrid , or to send some confidential friend with assurances and explanations . Another figure now enters on the scene , a George Fitzwilliam . I do not know who he was , or why Hawkins chose him for his purpose . The Duke of Feria was one of Philip 's most trusted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a 5 66 English Seamen in the Sixteenth . Century maid of honour to Queen Mary . It is possible that Fitzwilliam had some acquaintance with her or with her family . At any rate , he went to the Spanish Court ; he addressed h i m s e l f to the Ferias ; he won their confidence , and by their means was admitted to an interview with Philip . Ile represented Hawkins as a faithful Catliolic who was indignant at the progress of heresy in England , who was eager to assist in the overthrow of Elizabeth and the elevation of the Queen of Scots , and was able and willing to carry along with him the great Western privateer fleet , which had become so dreadful to the Spanish mind . Philip listened and was interested . It was only natural , he thought , that heretics should be robbers and pirates . If they could be recovered to the Church , their bad habits would leave them . The English navy was the most serious obstacle to the intended invasion . Still , Hawkins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be . He asked Fitzwilliam if his friend was acquainted with the Queen of Scots or the Duke of Norfolk . Fitzwilliam was obliged to say that he was not . The credentials of John Hawkins were his own right hand . He was making the King a magnificent offer ; nothing less than a squadron of the finest ships in the world ? not perhaps iin the best condition , he added , with cool British impudence , owing to the Queen 's parsimony , but easily to be put in order again if the King would pay the seamen 's wages and advance some money for repairs . The release of a few poor prisoners was a small price to ask for such a service . Sir John Hawkins and Philip the Second 67 The King was still wary , watching the bait like an old pike , but hesitating to seize it ; but the duke and duchess were willing to be themselves securities for Fitzwilliam 's faith , and Philip promised at last that if Hawkins would send him a letter of recommendation from the Queen of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done . The Ferias were dangerously enthusiastic . They talked freely to Fitzwilliam of the Queen of Scots and her prospects . They trusted him with letters and presents to her which would secure his admittance to her confidence . Hawkins had sent him over for the single purpose of cheating Philip into releasing his comrades from the Inquisition ; and he had been introduced to secrets of high political moment ; like Saul , the son of Kish , he had gone to seek his father 's asses and he had found a kingdom . Fitzwilliam hurried home with his letters and his news . Things were now serious . Hawkins could act no further on his own responsibility . He consulted Cecil . Cecil consulted the Queen , and it was agreed that the practice , as it was called , should be carried further . It might lead to the discovery of the whole secret . Very treacherous , think some good people . Well , there are times when one admires even treacherynec lox est justior ulla Quam necis artifices arte perire sua . King Philip was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his sovereign . Was it so wrong to hoist the engineer with his own petard ? 68 English Seamen in the Sixteenth Century Was it wrong of Hamlet to linger the packet of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern and rewrite his uncle 's despatch ? Let us have done with cant in these matters . Mary Stuart was at Sheffield Castle in charge of Lord Shrewsbury , and Fitzwilliam could not see her without an order from the Crown . Shrewsbury , though loyal to Elizabeth , was notoriously well inclined to Mary , and therefore could not be taken into confidence . In writing to him Cecil merely said that friends of Fitzwilliam 's were in prison in Spain ; that if the Queen of Scots would intercede for them , Philip might be induced to let them go . He might therefore allow Fitzwilliam to have a private audience with that Queen . Thus armed , Fitzwilliam went down to Sheffield . He was introduced . He began with presenting Mary with the letters and remembrances from the Ferias , which at once opened her heart . It was impossible for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was delighted at receiving a visitor from the Court of Spain . She was prudent enough to avoid dangerous confidences , but she said she was always pleased when she could do a service to Englishmen , and with all her heart would intercede for the prisoners . She wrote to Philip , she wrote to the duke and duchess , and gave the letters to Fitzwilliam to deliver . Ho took them to London , called on Don Gerald , and told him of his success . Don Gerald also wrote to his master , wrote unguardedly , and also trusted Fitzwilliam with the despatch . Sir John Lfcttvkitts mid Philip /hi , ill The various packets were taken first to Cecil , and were next shown to the Queen . They were then returned to Fitzwilliam , who once more went off wit lc them to Madrid . If the letters produced the expected effect , Cecil calmly observed that divers commodities would ensue . English sailors would be released from the Inquisition and the galleys . The enemy 's intentions would be discovered . If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had suggested , and assist in the repairs of the ships at Plymouth , credit would be obtained for a sum of money which could be employed to his own detriment . If Alva attempted the projected invasion , Hawkins might take the ships as if to escort him , and then do some notable exploit in mid-Channel . You will observe the downright directness of Cecil , Hawkins , and the other parties in the matter . There is no wrapping up their intentions in fine phrases , no parade of justification . They went straight to their point . It was very characteristic of Englishmen in those stern , dangerous times . They looked facts in the face , and did what fact required . All really happened exactly as I have described it : the story is told in letters and documents of the authenticity of which there is not the smallest doubt . We will follow Fitzwilliam . He arrived at the Spanish Court at the moment when Ridolfi had brought from Rome the Pope 's blessing on the conspiracy . The final touches were being added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; all 70 English Seamen in the Sixteenth Century was the credulity of enthusiasm ! Mary Stuart 's letter satisfied Philip . Tho prisoners were dismissed , each with ten dollars in his pocket . An agreement was formally drawn and signed in the Escurial , in which Philip gave Hawkins a pardon for his misdemeanours in the West Indies , a patent for a Spanish peentgo , and a letter of credit for 40,0001. to put the privateers in a condition to do service , and the money was actually paid by Philip 's London agent . Admitted as he now was to full confidence , Fitzwilliam learnt all particulars of the great plot . Tho story reads like a chapter from Monte Cristo , and yet it is literally true . It ends with a letter which I will read to you , from Hawkins to Cecil : My very good Lord , ? It may please your Honour to be advertised that Fitzwilliam is returned from Spain , where his message was acceptably received , both by the King himself , the Duke of Feria , and others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with great expedition and great countenance and favour of the King . The Articles are sent to the Ambassador with orders also for the money to be paid to me by hint , for the enterprise to proceed with all diligence . The pretence is that my powers should join with the Duke of Alva 's powers , which he loth secretly provide in Flanders , as well as with powers which will come with the Duke of Medina Celi out of Spain , and to invade this realm and set up the Sir John Hawkins and Philipp the Second 71 Queen of Scots . They have practised with um for the burning of Her Majesty 's ships . Therefore there should be some good care had of them , hut not as it may appear that anything is discovered . The King has sent a ruby of good price to the Queen of Scots , with letters also which in my judgment were good to be delivered . The letters be of no importance , but his message by word is to comfort her , and say that he hath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own . It were good also that Fitzwilliam may have access to the Queen of Scots to render thanks for the delivery of the prisoners who are now at liberty . It will be a very good colour for your Lordship to confer with him more largely . I have sent your Lordship the copy of my pardon from the King of Spain , in the order and manner I have it , with my great titles and honours from the King , from which God deliver me . Their practices be very mischievous , and they be never idle ; but God , I hope , will confound them and turn their devices on their own necks . Your Lordship 's most faithfully to my power , JOHN HAWKINS . ' A few more words will conclude this curious episode . With the clue obtained by Fitzwilliam , and confessions twisted out of Story and other unwilling witnesses , the Ridolfi conspiracy was unravelled before it broke into act . Norfolk lost his head . The inferior miscreants were hanged . The Queen of 72 English Seamen in the Sixteenth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accentuated the Protestant character of the Church of England by embodying the Thirty-nine Articles in a statute . Alva , who distrusted Ridolfi from the first and disliked encouraging rebellion , refused to interest himself further in Anglo-Catholic plots . Elizabeth and Cecil could now breathe more freely , and read Philip a lesson on the danger of plotting against the lives of sovereigns . So long as England and Spain were nominally at peace , the presence of De la Mark and his privateers in the Downs was at least indecent . A committee of merchants at Bruges represented that their losses by it amounted ( as I said ) to three million ducats . Elizabeth , being now in comparative safety , affected to listen to remonstrances , and orders were sent down to De la Mark that he must prepare to leave . It is likely that both the Queen and he understood each other , and that De la Mark quite well knew where he was to go , and what he was to do . Alva now held every fortress in the Low Countries , whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The duke 's great statue stood in the square at Antwerp as a symbol of the annihilation of the ancient liberties of the Provinces . By sea alone the Prince of Orange still continued the unequal struggle ; but if he was to maintain himself as a sea power anywhere , he required a harbour of his own in his own country . Dover and the Thames had served for a time as a base of operations , but it could not last , and without a footing in Holland Sir , h ) /nn Hawkins and th Second 78 itself eventual success was impossible . All the Protestant world was interested in his fate , and De la Mark , with his miscellaneous gathering of Dutch , English , and Huguenot rovers , were ready for any desperate exploit . The order was to leave Dover immediately , but it was not construed strictly . He lingered in the Downs for six weeks . At length , one morning at the end of March 1572 , a Spanish convoy known to be richly loaded appeared in the Straits . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seized two of the largest hulks , rifled them , flung their crews overboard , and chased the rest up Channel . A day or two after he suddenly showed himself off Brille , at the mouth of the Meuse . A boat was sent on shore with a note to the governor , demanding the instant surrender of the town to the admiral of the Prince of Orange . The inhabitants rose in enthusiasm ; the garrison was small , and the governor was obliged to comply . De la Mark took possession . A few priests and monks attempted resistance , but were put down without difficulty , and the leaders killed . The churches were cleared of their idols , and the mass replaced by the Calvinistic service . Cannon and stores , furnished from London , were landed , and Brille was made impregnable before Alva had realised what had happened to him . He is said to have torn his beard for anger . Flushing followed suit . In a week or two all the strongest places on the coast had revolted , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Repub74 English Seamen in the Sixteenth Century lie , which at England 's side was to strike out of Philip 's hand the sceptre of the seas , and to save the Protestant religion . We may think as we please of these Beggars of the Ocean , those Norse corsairs come to life again with the flavour of Genevan theology in them ; but for daring , for ingenuity , for obstinate determination to be spiritually free or to die for it , the like of the Protestant privateers of the sixteenth century has been rarely met with in this world . England rang with joy when the news came that Brille was taken . Church bells pealed , and bonfires blazed . Money poured across in streams . Exiled families went back to their homes ? which were to be their homes once more ? and the Zealanders and Hollanders , entrenched among their ditches , prepared for an amphibious conflict with the greatest power then upon the earth . LECTURE IV DRAKE 'S VOYAGE ROUND THE WORLD I SUPPOSE some persons present have heard the name of Lope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s time . Very few of you probably know more of him than his name , and yet he ought to have some interest for us , as he was one of the many enthusiastic young Spaniards who sailed in the Great Armada . He had been disappointed in some love affair . He was an earnest Catholic . He wanted distraction , and it is needless to say that he found distraction enough in the English Channel to put his love troubles out of his mind . His adventures brought before him with some vividness the character of the nation with which his own country was then in the death-grapple , especially the character of the great English seaman to whom the Spaniards universally attributed their defeat . Lope studied the exploits of Francis Drake from his first appearance to his end , and he celebrated those exploits , as England herself has never yet thought it worth her while to do , by making him the hero of an epic poem . There are heroes and heroes . Lope de Vega 's epic is called The Dragontea . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Apoc76 English Seamen in the Sixteenth Century alypse . We English have been contented to allow Drake a certain qualified praise . We admit that he was a bold , dexterous sailor , that he did his country good service at the Invasion . We allow that he was a famous navigator , and sailed round the world , which no one else had done before him . But ? there is always a but - of course ho was a robber and a corsair , and the only excuse for him is that he was no worse than most of his contemporaries . To Lope do Vega he was a great deal worse . He was Satan himself , the incarnation of the Genius of Evil , the arch-enemy of the Church of God . It is worth while to look more particularly at the figure of a man who appeared to the Spaniards in such terrible proportions . I , for my part , believe a time will come when we shall see better than we see now what the Reformation was , and what we owe to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subject of a great English national epic as grand as the Odyssey . ' In my own poor way meanwhile I shall try in these lectures to draw you a sketch of Drake and his doings as they appear to myself . To-day I can but give you a part of the rich and varied story , but if all goes well I hope I may bo able to continuo it at a future time . I have not yet done with Sir John Hawkins . We shall hear of him again . Ile became the manager of Elizabeth 's dockyards . He it was who turned out the ships that fought Philip 's fleet iii the Channel in such condition that net a hull leaked , not a Drake 's Voyage Round the IVoi 1,1 ? 4 spar was sprung , not a rope parted at an unseasonable moment , and this at a minimum Of costs . He served himself in the squadron which he had equipped . He was one of the small group of admirals who met that Sunday afternoon in the cabin of the ark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of his anchorage at Calais . He was a child of the sea , and at sea he died , sinking at last into his mother 's arms . But of this hereafter . I must speak now of his still more illustrious kinsman , Francis Drake . I told you the other day generally who Drake was and where he came from ; how he went to sea as a boy , found favour with his master , became early an owner of his own ship , sticking steadily to trade . You hear nothing of him in connection with the Channel pirates . It was not till he was five-and-twenty that he was tempted by Hawkins into the negro-catching business , and of this one experiment was enough . He never tried it again . The portraits of him vary very much , as indeed it is natural that they should , for most of those which pass for Drake were not meant for Drake at all . It is the fashion in this country , and a very bad fashion , when we find a remarkable portrait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it at random after some eminent man , and there it remains to perplex or mislead . The best likeness of Drake that I know is an engraving in Sir William Stirling-Maxwell 's collection of sixteenth-century notabilities , representing 78 English Seamen in the Sixteenth Century him , as a scroll says at the foot of the plate , at the age of forty-three . The face is round , the forehead broad and full , with the short brown hair curling crisply on either side . The eyebrows are highly arched , the eyes firm , clear , and open . I can not undertake for the colour , but I should judge they would be dark grey , like an eagle 's . The nose is short and thick , the mouth and chin hid by a heavy moustache on the upper lip , and a close-clipped beard well spread over chin and cheek . The expression is good-humoured , but absolutely inflexible , not a weak line to be seen . He was of middle height , powerfully built , perhaps too powerfully for grace , unless the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his breadth . I have seen another portrait of him , with pretensions to authenticity , in which he appears with a slighter figure , eyes dark , full , thoughtful , and stern , a sailor 's cord about his neck with a whistle attached to it , and a ring into which a thumb is carelessly thrust , the weight of the arms resting on it , as if in a characteristic attitude . Evidently this is a carefully drawn likeness of some remarkable seaman of the time . I should like to believe it to be Drake , but I can feel no certainty about it . We left him returned home in the Judith from San Juan de Ulloa , a ruined man . Ile had never injured the Spaniards . He had gone out with his cousin merely to trade , and he had met with a hearty reception from the settlers wherever he had been . A Spanish admiral had treacherously set // upon him and his kinsmen , destroyed half their vessels , and robbed them of all that they 11 , u1 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for whose fate they might fear the worst . Drake thenceforth considered Spanish property as fair game till he had made up his own losses . He waited quietly for four years till he had re-established himself , and then prepared to try fortune again in a more daring form . The ill-luck at San Juan de Ulloa had risen from loose tongues . There had been too much talk about it . Too many parties had been concerned . The Spanish Government had notice and were prepared . Drake determined to act for himself , have no partners , and keep his own secret . He found friends to trust him with money without asking for explanations . The Plymouth sailors were eager to take their chance with him . His force was absurdly small : a sloop or brigantine of a hundred tons , which he called the Dragon ( perhaps , like Lope de Vega , playing on his own name ) , and two small pinnaces . With these he left Plymouth in the fall of the summer of 1572 . He had ascertained that Philip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Panama , carried across the isthmus on mules ' backs on the line of M. de Lesseps ' canal , and re-shipped at Nombre de Dios , at the mouth of the Chagre River . He told no one where he was going . He was no more communicative than necessary after his return , and the results , rather than the particulars , of 80 English Seamen in the Sixteenth Century his adventure are all that can be certainly known . Discretion told him to keep his counsel , and he kept it . The Drake family published an account of this voyage in the middle of the next century , but obviously mythical , in parts demonstrably false , and nowhere to be ( ( ( Tended on . It can be made out , however , that he did go to Nombre de Dios , that he found his way into the town , and saw stores of bullion there which he would have liked to carry off but could not . A romantic story of a fight in the town I disbelieve , first because his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been absurd , and next because if there had been really anything like a battle an alarm would have been raised in the neighbourhood , and it is evident that no alarm was given . In the woods were parties of runaway slaves , who were called Cimarons . It was to these that Drake addressed himself , and they volunteered to guide him where he could surprise the treasure convoy on the way from Panama . His movements were silent and rapid . One interesting incident is mentioned which is authentic . The Cirnarons took him through the forest to the watershed from which the streams flow to both oceans . Nothing could be seen through the jungle of undergrowth ; but Drake climbed a tall tree , saw from the top of it the Pacific glittering below him , and made a vow that one day he would himself sail a ship in those waters . For the present he had immediate work on Drake 's Voyage Round the Mold sl hand . His guides kept their word . They led him to the track from Panama , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard of the mule bells as they were coming up the pass . There was no suspicion of danger , not the faintest . The mule train had but its ordinary guard , who fled at the first surprise . The immense booty fell all into Drake 's hands ? gold , jewels , silver bars ? and got with much ease , as Prince Hal said at Gadshill . The silver they buried , as too heavy for transport . The gold , pearls , rubies , emeralds , and diamonds they carried down straight to their ship . The voyage home went prosperously . The spoils were shared among the adventurers , and they had no reason to complain . They were wise enough to hold their tongues , and Drake was in a condition to look about him and prepare for bigger enterprises . Rumours got abroad , spite of reticence . Imagination was high in flight just then ; rash amateurs thought they could make their fortunes in the same way , and tried it , to their sorrow . A sort of inflation can be traced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even Hawkins ? the clear , practical Hawkins ? was infected . This was not in Drake 's line . He kept to prose and fact . He studied the globe . He examined all the charts that be could get . He became known to the Privy Council and the Queen , and prepared for an enterprise which would make his name and frighten Philip in earnest . 6 82 English Seamen in the Sixteenth Century The ships which the Spaniards used on the Pacific were usually built on the spot . But Magellan was known to have gone by the Horn , and where a Portuguese could go an Englishman could go . Drake proposed to try . There was a party in Elizabeth 's Council against these adventures , and in favour of peace with Spain ; but Elizabeth herself was al ways for enterprises of pith and moment . She was willing to help , and others of her Council were willing too , provided their names were not to appear . The responsibility was to be Drake 's own . Again the vessels in which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pelican , or Golden Hinde , which belonged to Drake himself , was called but 120 tons , at best no larger than a modern racing yawl , though perhaps no racing yawl ever left White 's yard better found for the work which she had to do . The next , the Elizabeth , of London , was said to be eighty tons ; a small pinnace of twelve tons , in which we should hardly risk a summer cruise round the Land 's End , with two sloops or frigates of fifty and thirty tons , made the rest . The Elizabeth was commanded by Captain Winter , a Queen 's officer , and perhaps a son of the old admiral . We may credit Drake with knowing what ho was about . He and his comrades were carrying their lives in their hands . If they were taken they would be inevitably hanged . Their safety depended on speed of sailing , and specially on the power of working fast to windward , which the heavy square ) re1v ' 8 1'u//rrr/r , Eotoia the 11 ' rlrl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 160 men and boys . Drake had his brother with Among his officers were the chaplain , Mr : Fletcher , another minister of some kind who spoke Spanish , and in one of the sloops a mysterious Mr. Doughty . Who Mr. Doughty was , and why he was sent out , is uncertain . When an expedition of consequence was on hand , the Spanish party in the Cabinet usually attached to it some second in command whose business was to defeat the object . When Drake went to Cadiz in after years to singe King Philip 's beard , he had a colleague sent with him whom he had to lock into his cabin before he could get to his work . So far as I can make out , Mr. Doughty had a similar commission . On this occasion secrecy was impossible . It was generally known that Drake was going to the Pacific through Magellan Straits , to act afterwards on his own judgment . The Spanish ambassador , now Don Bernardino de Mendoza , in informing Philip of what was intended , advised him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship , and the execution of every English sailor , that appeared on either side the isthmus in West Indian waters . The orders were despatched , but so impossible it seemed that an English pirate could reach the Pacific , that the attention was confined to the Caribbean Sea , and not a hint of alarm was sent across to the other side . On November 15 , 1577 , the Pelican and her consort sailed out of Plymouth Sound . The elements 84 English Seamen in the Sixteenth Century frowned on their start . On the second day they were caught in a winter gale . The Pelican sprung her mainmast , and they put back to refit and repair . But Drake defied auguries . Before the middle of December all was again in order . The weather mended , and with a fair wind and smooth water they made a fast run across the Bay of Biscay and down the coast to the Cape de Verde Islands . There , taking up the north-east trades , they struck across the Atlantic , crossed the line , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They passed the mouth of the Plate River , finding to their astonishment fresh water at the ship 's side in fifty-four fathoms . All seemed so far going well , when one morning Mr. Doughty 's sloop was missing , and lie along with her . Drake , it seemed , had already reason to distrust Doughty , and guessed the direction in which he had gone . The Marigold was sent in pursuit , and he was overtaken and brought back . To prevent a repetition of such a performance , Drake took the sloop 's stores out of her , burnt her , distributed the crew through the other vessels , and took Mr. Doughty under his own charge . On June 20 they reached Port St. Julian , on the coast of Patagonia . They had been long on the way , and the southern winter had come round , and they had to delay further to make more particatlar inquiry into Doughty 's desertion . An ominous and strange spectacle met their eyes as they entered the harbour . In that utterly desolate spot a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clean by the vultures . Drake 's Voyage Itmih ( t the Wort , / It was one of Magellan 's crew who had been executed there for mutiny fifty years before . ' 1 ' 110 sit I , , fate was to befall the unhappy Englishman who had been guilty of the same fault . Without the strictest discipline it was impossible for the enterprise to succeed , and Doughty had been guilty of worse than disobedience . We are told briefly that his conduct was found tending to contention , and threatening the success of the voyage . Part he was said to have confessed ; part was proved against him ? one knows not what . A court was formed out of the crew . He was tried , as near as circumstances allowed , according to English usage . He was found guilty , and was sentenced to die . He made no complaint , or none of which a record is preserved . He asked for the Sacrament , which was of course allowed , and Drake himself communicated with him . They then kissed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his comrades , laid his head on the block , and so ended . His offence can be only guessed ; but the suspicious curiosity about his fate which was shown afterwards by Mendoza makes it likely that he was in Spanish pay . The ambassador cross-questioned Captain Winter very particularly about him , and we learn one remarkable fact from Mendoza 's letters not mentioned by any English writer , that Drake was himself the executioner , choosing to bear the entire responsibility . This done , ' writes an eyewitness , the general made divers speeches to the whole company , persuading us to unity , obedience , and regard of our 86 English Seamen in the Sixteenth Century voyage , and for the better confirmation thereof willed every man the Sunday following to prepare himself to receive the Communion as Christian brothers and friends ought to do , which was done in very reverend sort ; and so with good contentment every man went about his business . ' You must take this last incident into your conception of Drake 's character , think of it how you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the year , and they remained for six weeks in Port St. Julian . They burnt the twelve-ton pinnace , as too small for the work they had now before them , and there remained only the Pelican , the Elizabeth , and the Marigold . In cold wild weather they weighed at last , and on August 20 made the opening of Magellan 's Straits . The passage is seventy miles long , tortuous and dangerous . They had no charts . The ships ' boats led , taking soundings as they advanced . Icy mountains overhung them on either side ; heavy snow fell below . They brought up occasionally at an island to rest the men , and let them kill a few seals and penguins to give them fresh food . Everything they saw was new , wild , and wonderful . Having to feel their way , they were three weeks in getting through . They had counted on reaching the Pacific that the worst of their work was over , and that they could run north at once into warmer and calmer latitudes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stormiest they had ever sailed on . A fierce westerly gale drove them 600 // miles to the south-east outside the horn . It had been supposed , hitherto , that Tierra del F zi , go It u4 solid land to the South Pole , and that the Strait s were the only communication between the Atlantic and the Pacific . They now learnt the true shape and character of the Western Continent . In the latitude of Cape Horn a westerly gale blows for ever round the globe ; the waves the highest any-where known . The Marigold went down in the tremendous encounter . Captain Winter , in the Elizabeth , made his way back into Magellan 's Straits . There he lay for three weeks , lighting fires nightly to show Drake where he was , but no Drake appeared . They had agreed , if separated , to meet on the coast in the latitude of Valparaiso ; but Winter was chicken-hearted , or else traitorous like Doughty , and sore , we are told , against the mariners ' will , ' when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where he reported that all the ships were lost but the Pelican , and that the Pelican was probably lost too . Drake had believed better of Winter , and had not expected to be so deserted . He had himself taken refuge among the islands which form the Cape , waiting for the spring and milder weather . He used the time in making surveys , and observing the habits of the native Patagonians , whom he found a tough race , going naked amidst ice and snow . The days lengthened , and the sea smoothed at last . He then sailed for Valparaiso , hoping to meet Winter there , as he had arranged . At Val88 English Seamen in the Sixteenth Century paraiso there was no Winter , but there was in the port instead a great galleon just come in from Peru . The galleon 's crow took him for a Spaniard , hoisted their colours , and beat their drums . The Pelican shot alongside . The English sailors in high spirits leapt on board . A Plymouth lad who could speak Spanish knocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perro ! " Down , you dog , down ! ' No life was taken ; Drake never hurt man if he could help it . The crew crossed themselves , jumped overboard , and swain ashore . The prize was examined . Four hundred pounds ' weight of gold was found in her , besides other plunder . The galleon being disposed of , Drake and his men pulled ashore to look at the town . The people had all fled . In the church they found a chalice , two cruets , and an altar-cloth , which were made over to the chaplain to improve his Communion furniture . A few pipes of wine and a Greek pilot who knew the way to Lima completed the booty . Shocking piracy , ' you will perhaps say . But what Drake was doing would have been all right and good service had war been declared , and the essence of things does not alter with the form . In essence there was war , deadly war , between Philip and Elizabeth . Even later , when the Armada sailed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the important part of the matter . It was but stroke for stroke , and the English arm proved the stronger . Still hoping to find Winter in advance of him , Drake 's Jo/aye Iir , rrx l th , II ' , . , t , t sl Drake went on next to Tarapaca , where silver from the Andes mines was shipped for Panama . At Tarapaca there was the same unconsciousness of danger . The silver bars lay piled on the quay , the muleteers who had brought them were sleeping peacefully in the sunshine at their side . The muleteers were left to their slumbers . The bars were lifted into the English boats . A train of mules or llamas came in at the moment with a second load as rich as the first . This , too , went into the Pelican 's hold . The bullion taken at Tarapaca was worth near half a million ducats . Still there were no news of Winter . Drake began to realize that he was now entirely alone , and had only himself and his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but to go through with it , danger adding to the interest . Arica was the next point visited . Half a hundred blocks of silver were picked up at Arica . After Arica came Lima , the chief depot of all , where the grandest haul was looked for . At Lima , alas ! they were just too late . Twelve great hulks lay anchored there . The sails were unbent , the men were ashore . They contained nothing but some chests of reals and a few bales of silk and linen . But a thirteenth , called by the gods Our Lady of the Conception , called by men Cacafuego , a name incapable of translation , had sailed a few days before for the isthmus , with the whole produce of the Lima mines for the season . Her ballast was silver , her cargo gold and emeralds and rubies . 90 English Seamen in the Sixteenth Century Drake deliberately cut the cables of the ships in the roads , that they might drive ashore and be unable to follow him . The Pelican spread her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in pursuit . ITo would know the Cacafuego , so he learnt at Lima , by the peculiar cut of her sails . The first man who caught sight of her was promised a gold chain for his reward . A sail was seen on the second ( lay . It was not the chase , but it was worth stopping for . Eighty pounds ' weight of gold was found , and a great gold crucifix , set with emeralds said to be as large as pigeon 's eggs . They took the kernel . They left the shell . Still on and on . We learn from the Spanish accounts that the Viceroy of Lima , as soon as he recovered from his astonishment , despatched ships in pursuit . They came up with the last plundered vessel , heard terrible tales of the rovers ' strength , and went back for a larger force . The Pelican meanwhile went along upon her course for 800 miles . At length , when in the latitude of Quito and close under the shore , the Cacafuego 's peculiar sails were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was , freighted with the fruit of Aladdin 's garden , going lazily along a few miles ahead . Care was needed in approaching her . If she guessed the Pelican 's character , she would run in upon the land and they would lose her . It was afternoon . The sun was still above the horizon , and 1 ) ra , ke meant to wait till night , when the breeze would be off the shore , as in the tropics it always is. // The Pelican sailed two feet to the Cacafuego 's one . Drake filled his empty wine-skins with water and trailed them astern to stop his way . The chase supposed that she was followed by some heavy-loaded trader , and , wishing for company on a lonely voyage , she slackened sail and waited for him to come up . At length the sun went down into the ocean , the rosy light faded from off the snows of the Andes ; and when both ships had become invisible from the shore , the skins were hauled in , the night wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pelican 's bows . The Cacafuego was swiftly overtaken , and when within a cable 's length a voice hailed her to put her head into the wind . The Spanish commander , not understanding so strange an order , held on his course . A broadside brought down his mainyard , and a flight of arrows rattled on his deck . He was himself wounded . In a few minutes he was a prisoner , and Our Lady/ of /he Concept ion and her precious freight were in the corsair 's power . The wreck was cut away ; the ship was cleared ; a prize crew was put on board . Both vessels turned their heads to the sea . At daybreak no land was to be seen , and the examination of the prize began . The full value was never acknowledged . The invoice , if there was one , was destroyed . The accurate figures were known only to Drake and Queen Elizabeth . A published schedule acknowledged to twenty tons of silver bullion , thirteen chests of silver coins , and a hundredweight of gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sixteenth Century besides in indefinite quantity , and a great store ' of pearls , emeralds , and diamonds . The Spanish Government proved a loss of a million and a half of ducats , excluding what belonged to private persons . The total capture was immeasurably greater . Drake , we are told , was greatly satisfied . He thought it prudent to stay in the neighbourhood no longer than necessary . He went north with all sail set , taking his prize along with him . The master , Sall Juan de Anton , was removed on board the Pelican to have his wound attended to . He remained as Drake 's guest for a week , and sent in a report of what he observed to the Spanish Government . One at least of Drake 's party spoke excellent Spanish . This person took San Juan over the ship . She showed signs , San Juan said , of rough service , but was still in fine condition , with ample arms , spare rope , mattocks , carpenters ' tools of all descriptions . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men-of-war , the rest young fellows , ship-boys and the like . Drake himself was treated with great reverence ; a sentinel stood always at his cabin door . He dined alone with music . No mystery was made of the Pelican 's exploits . The chaplain showed San Juan the crucifix set with emeralds , and asked him if he could seriously believe that to be God . San Juan asked Drake how he meant to go home . Drake showed him a globe with three courses traced oil it . There was the way that he had come , there was the way by Drab 's I'rrrinyr /i ? rrnrl Phr Woad ti:t China and the Cape of Good Hope , and there was a third way which he did not explain . San Juan asked if Spain and England were at war . Drake said he had a commission from the Queen . II is captures were for her , not for himself , He added afterwards that the Viceroy of Mexico had robbed him and his kinsman , and he was making good his losses . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I know the Viceroy will send for thee to inform himself of my proceedings . Tell him he shall do well to put no more Englishmen to death , and to spare those he has in his hands , for if he do execute them I will hang 2,000 Spaniards and send him their heads . ' After a week 's detention San Juan and his men were restored to the empty Cacafuego , and allowed to go . On their way back they fell in with the two cruisers sent in pursuit from Lima , reinforced by a third from Panama . They were now fully armed ; they went in chase , and according to their own account came up with the Pelican . But , like Lope de Vega , they seemed to have been terrified at Drake as a sort of devil . They confessed that they dared not attack him , and again went back for more assistance . The Viceroy abused them as cowards , arrested the officers , despatched others again with peremptory orders to seize Drake , even if he was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flown . They found nothing , perhaps to their relief . 94 English Seamen in the Sixteenth Century A despatch went instantly across the Atlantic to Philip . One squadron was sent off from Cadiz to watch the Straits of Magellan , and another to patrol the Caribbean Sea . It was thought that Drake 's third way was no seaway at all , that he meant to leave the Pelican at Darien , carry his plunder over the mountains , and build a ship at Honduras to take him home . His real idea was that he might hit off the passage to the north of which Frobisher and Davis thought they had found the eastern entrance . He stood on towards California , picking up an occasional straggler in the China trade , with silk , porcelain , gold , and emeralds . Fresh water was a necessity . He put in at Guatulco for it , and his proceedings were humorously prompt . The alcaldes at Guatulco were in session trying a batch of negroes . An English boat 's crew appeared in court , tied the alcaldes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pelican , there to remain as hostages till the water-casks were filled . North again he fell in with a galleon carrying out a new Governor to the Philippines . The Governor was relieved of his boxes and his jewels , and then , says one of the party , Our General , thinking himself in respect of his private injuries received from the Spaniards , as also their contempt and indignities offered to our country and Prince , sufficiently satisfied and revenged , and supposing her Majesty would rest contented with this service , began to consider the best way home . ' The first necessity was a complete overhaul of the ship . Before the days of copDrake 's // per sheathing weeds grew thick under water . Barnacles formed in clusters , stopping the speed , and sea-worms bored through the planking . Twenty thousand miles lay between the Pelican and Plymouth Sound , and Drake was not a man to run idle chances . Still holding his north course till he had left the furthest Spanish settlement far to the south , he put into Canoas Bay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forge and workshop , and repaired and rerigged her with a month 's labour from stem to stern . With every rope new set up and new canvas on every yard , he started again on April 16 , 1579 , and continued up the coast to Oregon . The air grew cold though it was summer . The men felt it from having been so long in the tropics , and dropped out of health . There was still no sign of a passage . If passage there was , Drake perceived that it must be of enormous length . Magellan 's Straits , he guessed , would be watched for him , so he decided on the route by the Cape of Good Hope . In the Philippine ship he had found a chart of the Indian Archipelago . With the help of this and his own skill he hoped to find his way . He went down again to San Francisco , landed there , found the soil teeming with gold , made acquaintance with an Indian king who hated the Spaniards and wished to become an English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ territories . Avoiding the course from Mexico to the Philippines , he made a direct course to the Moluccas , and brought up again at the Island of Celebes . Here the Pelican was a 96 English Seamen in the Sixteenth Century second time docked and scraped . The crew had a month 's rest among the fireflies and vampires of the tropical forest . Leaving Celebes , they entered on the most perilous part of the whole voyage . They wound their way among coral reefs and low islands scarcely visible above the water-line . In their chart the only outlet marked into the Indian Ocean was by the Straits of Malacca . But Drake guessed rightly that there must be some nearer opening , and felt his way looking for it along the coast of Java . Spite of all his care , he was once on the edge of destruction . One evening as night was closing in a grating sound was heard under the Pelican 's keel . In another moment she was hard and fast on a reef . The breeze was light and the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Francis Drake . She lay immovable till daybreak . At dawn the position was seen not to be entirely desperate . Drake himself showed all the qualities of a great commander . Cannon were thrown over and cargo that was not needed . In the afternoon , the wind changing , the lightened vessel lifted off the rocks and was saved . The hull was uninjured , thanks to the Californian repairs . All on board had behaved well with the one exception of Mr. Fletcher , the chaplain . Mr. Fletcher , instead of working like a man , had whined about Divine retribution for the execution of Doughty . For the moment Drake passed it over . A few days after , they passed out through the Straits of Sunda , where they met the great ocean swell , // Homer 's /. eya xi , ? a BaXdvvns , and they knew then that all was well . There was now time to call Mr. Fletcher to account . It was no business of the chaplain to discourage and dispirit men in a moment of danger , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An English captain on his own deck represents the sovereign , and is head of Church as well as State . Mr. Fletcher was brought to the forecastle , where Drake , sitting on a sea-chest with a pair of panto21es in his hand , excommunicated him , pronounced him cut off from the Church of God , given over to the devil for the chastising of his flesh , and left him chained by the leg to a ring-bolt to repent of his cowardice . In the general good-humour punishment could not be of long duration . The next day the poor chaplain had his absolution and returned to his berth and his duty . The Pelican met with no more adventures . Sweeping in fine clear weather round the Cape of Good Hope , she touched once for water at Sierra Leone , and finally sailed in triumph into Plymouth Harbour , where she had been long given up for lost , having traced the first furrow round the globe . Winter had come home eighteen months before , but could report nothing . The news of the doings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Spanish ambassador had been furious . It was known that Spanish squadrons had been sent in search . Complications would arise if Drake brought his plunder home , and timid politicians hoped that he was at the bottom of the sea . But 7 98 English Seamen in the Sixteenth Century here he was , actually arrived with a monarch 's ransom in his hold . English sympathy with an extraordinary exploit is always irresistible . Shouts of applause rang through the country , and Elizabeth , every bit of her an Englishwoman , felt with hersubjects . She sent for Drake to London , made him tell his story over and over again , and was never weary of listening to him . As to injury to Spain , Philip had lighted a fresh insurrection in Ireland , which had cost her dearly in lives and money . For Philip to demand compensation of England on the score of justice was it thing to make the gods laugh . So thought the Queen . So unfortunately did not think some members of her Council , Lord Burghley among them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spoils disgorged , or else that he would force Elizabeth upon the world as the confessed protectress of piracy . Burghley thought that , as things stood , some satisfaction ( or the form of it ) would have to be made . Elizabeth hated paying back as heartily as Falstaff , nor had she the least intention of throwing to the wolves a gallant Englishman , with whose achievements the world was ringing . She was obliged to allow the treasure to be registered by it responsible official , and an account rendered to Mendoza ; but for all that she meant to keep her own share of the spoils . She meant , too , that . Drake and his brave crew should not go unrewarded . Drake himself should have ten thousand pounds at least . Drake 's Vogaye Ronud Ow IV , . w rl 4,1 ! 1 Her action was eminently characteristic of her . On the score of real justice there was no doubt at all how matters stood between herself and Philip , who had tried to dethrone and kill her . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ untouched . She directed that it should be landed and scheduled . She trusted the business to Edmund Tremayne , of Sydenham , a neighbouring magistrate , on whom she could depend . She told him not to be too inquisitive , and she allowed Drake to go back and arrange the cargo before the examination was made . Let me now read you a letter from Tremayne himself to Sir Francis Walsingham : To give you some understanding how I have proceeded with Mr. Drake : I have at no time entered into the account to know more of the value of the treasure than he made me acquainted with ; and to say truth I persuaded him to impart to me no more than need , for so I saw him commanded in her Majesty 's behalf that he should reveal the certainty to no man living . I have only taken notice of so much as he has revealed , and the same I have seen to be weighed , registered , and packed . And to observe her Majesty 's commands for the ten thousand pounds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was landed secretly , and to remove the same out of the place before my son Henry and I should come to the weighing and registering of what was left , and so it was done , and no creature living by me made privy to it but himself ; and 100 English Seamen in the Sixteenth Century myself no privier to it than as you may perceive by this . I see nothing to charge Mr. Drake further than he is inclined to charge himself , and withal I must say he is inclined to advance the value to be deliv ered to her Majesty , and seeking in general to recompense all men that have been in the case dealers with him . As I dare take an oath , he will rather diminish his own portion than leave any of them unsatisfied . Aiid for his mariners and follow ers l : have seen hero as eye-witness , and have heard with my ears , such certain signs of goodwill as I can not yet see that any of them will leave his company . The whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great valour ; but my hap has been to see some particulars , and namely in this discharge of his company , as doth assure me that he is a man of great government , and that by the rules of God and his book , so as proceeding on such foundation his doings can not but prosper . ' The result of it all was that deductions were made from the capture equivalent to the property which Drake and Hawkins held themselves to have been treacherously plundered of at San Juan do Ulloa , with perhaps other liberal allowances for the cost of recovery . An account on part of what remained was then given to Mendoza . It was not returned to him or to Philip , but was laid up in the Tower till the final settlement of Philip 's and the Queen 's claims on each other ? the cost , for one thing , of the rebellion in Ireland . Cwn nissioners met and Thake 's Voyage Ilnun ( l the 11 ' , , l , l Is ) 1 argued and sat on ineffectually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the talk of restit lanai was over . Meanwhile , opinion varied about Drake 's own doings as it has varied since . Elizabeth lis-tened spellbound to his adventures , sent for him to London again , and walked with him publicly about the parks and gardens . She gave him a second ten thousand pounds . The Pelican was sent round to Deptford ; a royal banquet was held on board , Elizabeth attended and Drake was knighted . Men doza clamoured for the treasure in the Tower to be given up to him ; Walsingham wished to give it to the Prince of Orange ; Leicester and his party in the Council , who had helped to fit Drake out , thought it ought to be divided among themselves , and unless Mendoza lies they offered to share it with him if he would agree to a private arrangement . Mendoza says he answered that he would give twice pawn in the game , and so in fact it remained after the de ductions which we have seen had been made . Drake was lavish of his presents . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coronet set with splendid emeralds . He gave Bromley , the Lord Chancellor , 800 dollars ' worth of silver plate , and as much more to other members of the Council . The Queen wore her coronet on New Year 's Day ; the Chancellor was content to decorate his side-board at the cost of the Catholic King . Burghley and Sussex declined the splendid temptation ; they 102 English Seamen in the Sixteenth Century said they could accept no such precious gifts from a man whose fortune had been made by plunder . Burghley lived to see better into Drake 's value . Meanwhile , what now are we , looking back over our history , to say of those things ? the Channel privateering ; the seizure of Alva 's army money ; the sharp practice of Hawkins with the Queen of Scots and King Philip ; or this amazing performance of Sir Francis Drake in a vessel no larger than a second-rate yacht of a modern noble lord ? Resolution , daring , professional skill , all historians allow to these men ; but , like Burghley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much better , if at all better , than the later exploits of Morgan and Kidd . So cried the Catholics who wished Elizabeth 's ruin ; so cried Lope de Vega and King Philip . In milder language the modern philosopher repeats the unfavourable verdict , rejoices that he lives in an age when such doings are impossible , and apologises faintly for the excesses of an imperfect age . May I remind the philosopher that we live in an age when other things have also happily become impossible , and that if he and his friends were liable when they went abroad for their summer tours to be snapped by the familiars of the Inquisition , whipped , burnt alive , or sent to the galleys , he would perhaps think more leniently of any measures by which that respectable institution and its masters might be induced to treat philosophers with greater consideration ? Again , remember Dr. Johnson 's warning , Beware // of cant . In that intensely serious century men were more occupied with the realities than the forms of things . By encouraging rebellion in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor English seamen and merchants in fools ' coats at Seville , the King of Spain had given Elizabeth a hundred occasions for declaring war against him . , Situated as she was , with so many disaffected Catholic subjects , she could not begin a war on such a quarrel . She had to use such resources as she had , and of these resources the best was a splendid race of men who were not afraid to do for her at their own risk what commissioned officers would and might have justly done had formal war been declared , men who defeated the national enemy with materials conquered from himself , who were devoted enough to dispense with the personal security which the sovereign 's commission would have extended to prisoners of war , and face the certainty of being hanged if they were taken . Yes ; no doubt by the letter of the law of nations Drake and Hawkins were corsairs of the same stuff as Ulysses , as the rovers of Norway . But the common-sense of Europe saw through the form to the substance which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave them a place among the fighting heroes of England , from which I do not think they will be deposed by the eventual verdict of history . LECTURE V PARtiES IN THE STATE ON December 21 , 1585 , a remarkable scene took place in the English House of Commons . The Prince of Orange , after many attempts had failed , had been successfully disposed of in the Low Countries . A fresh conspiracy had just been discovered for a Catholic insurrection in England , supported by a foreign invasion ; the object of which was to dethrone Elizabeth and to give her crown to Mary Stuart . The Duke of Alva , at the time of the Ridolfi plot , had pointed out as a desirable preliminary , if the invasion was to succeed , the assassination of the Queen of England . The succession being undecided , he had calculated that the confusion would paralyse resistance , and the notorious favour with which Mary Stuart 's pretensions were regarded by a powerful English party would ensure her an easy victory were Elizabeth once removed . But this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last that so long as Elizabeth was alive Philip would not willingly sanction the landing of a Spanish army on English shores . Thus , among the more ardent Catholics , especially the refugees at the Seminary at Rheims , a crown in 1'aarlirs iar . Ilir Hh$ ( r 1a15 heaven was held out to any spiritual knight-errant who would remove the obstacle . The enterprise itself was not a difficult one . Elizabeth was aware of her danger , but she was personally fearless . She refused to distrust the Catholics . Her household was full of them . She admitted anyone to her presence who desired a private interview . Dr. Parry , a member of Parliament , primed by encouragements from the Cardinal of Como and the Vatican , had undertaken to risk his life to win the glorious prize . He introduced himself into the palace , properly provided with arms . He professed to have information of importance to give . The Queen received him repeatedly . Once he was alone with her in the palace garden , and was on the point of killing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by the likeness to her father . Parry was discovered and hanged , but Elizabeth refused to take warning . When there were so many aspirants for the honour of removing Jezebel , and Jezebel was so easy of approach , it was felt that one would at last succeed ; and the loyal part of the nation , led by Lord Burghley , formed themselves into an association to protect a life so vital to them and apparently so indifferent to herself . The subscribers bound themselves to pursue to the death all manner of persons who should attempt or consent to anything to the harm of her Majesty 's person ; never to allow or submit to any pretended successor by whom or for whom such detestable act should be attempted or committed ; but to pursue 106 English Seamen in the Sixteenth Century such persons to death and act the utmost revenge upon them . The bond in its first form was a visible creation of despair . It implied a condition of things in which order would have ceased to exist . The lawyers , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary Stuart 's interest , vehemently objected ; yet so passionate was public feeling that it was signed throughout the kingdom , and Parliament was called to pass an Act which would secure the same object . Mary Stuart , at any rate , was not to benefit by the crimes either of herself or her admirers . It was provided that if the realm was invaded , or a rebellion instigated by or for any one pretending a title to the crown after the Queen 's death , such pretender should be disqualified for ever . In the event of the Queen 's assassination the government was to devolve on a Committee of Peers and Privy Councillors , who were to examine the particulars of the murder and execute the perpetrators and their accomplices ; while , with a significant allusion , all Jesuits and seminary priests were required to leave the country instantly , under pain of death . The House of Commons was heaving with emotion when the Act was sent up to the Peers . To give expression to their burning feelings Sir Christopher Hatton proposed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Queen 's preservation . The 400 members all rose , and knelt on the floor of the House , repeating Hatton 's words after him , sentence by sentence . // Jesuits and seminary priests ! Attempts have been made to justify the conspiracies against Elizabeth from what is called the persecution of the innocent enthusiasts who came from Rheims to preach the Catholic faith to the English people . Popular writers and speakers dwell on the executions of Campian and his friends as worse than the Smithfield burnings , and amidst general admiration and approval these martyred saints have been lately canonised . Their mission , it is said , was purely religious . Was it so ? The chief article in the religion which they came to teach was the duty of obedience to the Pope , who had excommunicated the Queen , had absolved her subjects from their allegiance , and , by a relaxation of the Bull , had permitted them to pretend to loyalty ad illud tempos , till a Catholic army of deliverance should arrive . A Pope had sent a legate to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bloody insurrection there . But what these seminary priests were , and what their object was , will best appear from an account of the condition of England , drawn up for the use of the Pope and Philip , by Father Parsons , who was himself at the head of the mission . The date of it is 1585 , almost simultaneous with the scene in Parliament which I have just been describing . The English refugees , from Cardinal Pole downwards , were the most active and passionate preachers of a Catholic crusade against England . They failed , but they have revenged themselves in history . Pole , Sanders , Allen , and Parsons have coloured all that 108 English Seamen in the Sixteenth Century we suppose ourselves to know of Henry VIII . and Elizabeth . What I am about to read to you does not differ essentially from what we have already heard from these persons ; but it is new , and , being intended for practical guidance , is complete in its way .

An Oxford Church of England education is an excellent thing , and beautiful characters have been formed in the Catholic universities abroad ; but as the elements of dynamite are innocent in themselves , yet when fused together produce effects no one would have dreamt of , so Oxford and Rome , when they have run together , have always generated a somewhat furious compound . Parsons describes his statement as a brief note on the present condition of England , ' from which may be inferred the ease and opportuneness of the holy enterprise . England , ' he says , contains fiftytwo counties , of which forty are well inclined to the Catholic faith . Heretics in these are few , and are hated by all ranks . The remaining twelve are infected more or less , but even in these the Catholics are in the majority . Divide England into three parts ; two-thirds at least are Catholic at heart , though many conceal their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of two sorts ? one which makes an open profession regardless of consequences , the other believing at the bottom , but Purfies in the Stye 1()9 unwilling to risk life or fortune , aud so submitting outwardly to the heretic laws , but as eager as the Catholic confessors for redemption from slavery . The Queen and her party , ' he goes on , more fear these secret Catholics than those who wear their colours openly . The latter they can fine , disarm , and make innocuous . The others , being outwardly compliant , can not be touched , nor can any precaution be taken against their rising when the day of divine vengeance shall arrive . The counties specially Catholic are the most warlike , and contain harbours and other conveniences for the landing of an invading army . The north towards the Scotch border has been trained in constant fighting . The Scotch nobles on the other side are Catholic and will lend their help . So will all Wales . The inhabitants of the midland and southern provinces , where the taint is deepest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what war means . The towns are more corrupt than the country districts . But the strength of England does not lie , as on the Continent , in towns and cities . The town population are merchants and craftsmen , rarely or never nobles or magnates . The nobility , who have the real power , reside with their retinues in castles scattered over the land . The wealthy yeomen are strong and honest , all attached to the ancient faith , and may be counted on when an attempt is made for the restoration of it . The knights and gentry are generally well 110 English Seamen in the Sixteenth Century affected also , and will be well to the front . Many of their sons are being now educated in our seminaries . Some are in exile , but all , whether at home or abroad , will be active on our side . Of the great peers , marquises , earls , viscounts , and barons , part are with us , part against us . But the latter sort are new creations , whom the Queen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and therefore universally abhorred . Time premier peer of the old stock is the Earl of Arundel , son and heir of the late Duke of Norfolk , whom she has imprisoned because he tried to escape out of the realm . This earl is entirely Catholic , as well as his brothers and kinsmen ; and they have powerful vassals who are eager to revenge the injury of their lord . The Earl of Northumberland and his brothers are Catholics . They too have family wrongs to repay , their father having been this year murdered in the Tower , and they have placed themselves at my disposal . The Earl of Worcester and his heir hate heresy , and are devoted to us with all their dependents . The Earls of Cumberland and Southampton and Viscount Montague are faithful , and have a large following . Besides these we have many of the barons ?

With such support , it is impossible that we can fail . These lords and gentlemen , when they ; gee efficient // Bell coming to them , will certainly rise , and for the following reasons : l . Because some of the principals among them have given me their promise . 2 . Because , on hearing that Pope Pius intended to excommunicate and depose the Queen sixteen years ago , many Catholics did rise . They only failed because no support was sent them , and the Pope 's sentence had not at that time been actually published . Now , when the Pope has spoken and help is certain , there is not a doubt how they will act . 3 . Because the Catholics are now much more numerous , and have received daily instruction in their religion from our priests . There is now no orthodox Catholic in the whole realm who supposes that he is any longer bound in conscience to obey the Queen . Books for the occasion have been written and published by us , in which we prove that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty , to fight against the Queen and heresy when the Pope bids them ; and these books are so greedily read among them that when the time comes they are certain to take arms . 4 . The Catholics in these late years have shown their real feeling in the martyrdoms of priests and laymen , and in attempts made by several of them against the person and State of the Queen . Various Catholics have tried to kill her at the risk of their own lives , and are still trying . 5 . We have three hundred priests dispersed 112 English Seamen in the Sixteenth Century among the houses of the nobles and honest gentry . Every day we add to their number ; and these priests will direct the consciences and actions of the Catholics at the great crisis . G. They have been so harried and so worried that they hate the heretics worse than they hate the Turks . Should any of them fear the introduction of a Spanish army as dangerous to their national liberties , there is an easy way to satisfy their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is undertaken in the name of the Pope , and there will bo no more hesitation . We have ourselves prepared a book for their instruction , to be issued at the right moment . If his Holiness desires to see it we will have it translated into Latin for his use . Before the enterprise is undertaken the sentence of excommunication and deposition ought to be reissued , with special clauses . ' It must be published in all adjoining Catholic countries ; all Catholic kings and princes must be admonished to forbid every description of intercourse with the pretended Queen and her heretic subjects , and themselves especially to make or observe no treaties with her , to send no embassies to her and admit none ; to render no help to her of any sort or kind . Besides those who will be our friends for religion 's sake we shall have others with us ? neutrals or heretics of milder sort , or atheists , with whom England now abounds , who will join us in the inParties // terest of the Queen of Scots . Among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shrewsbury , Derby , Oxford , Rutland , and several other peers . The Queen of Scots herself will be of infinite assistance to us in securing these . She knows who are her secret friends . She has been able so far , and we trust will always be able , to communicate with them . She will see that they are ready at the right time . She has often written to me to say that she hopes that she will be able to escape when the time comes . In her last letter she urges me to be vehement with his Holiness in pushing on the enterprise , and bids him have no concern for her own safety . She believes that she can care for herself . If not , she says she will lose her life willingly in a cause so sacred . The enemies that we shall have to deal with are the more determined heretics whom we call Puritans , and certain creatures of the Queen , the Earls of Leicester and Huntingdon , and a few others . They will have an advantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stores , and the army and navy , belt none of them have ever seen a camp . The leaders have been nuzzled in love-making and Court pleasures , and they will all fly at the first shock of war . They have not a man who can command in the field . In the whole realm there are but two fortresses which could stand a three days ' siege . The people are enervated by long peace , and , except a few who have served with the heretics in Flanders , can not bear their arms . Of those few 8 114 English Seamen in the Sixteenth Century some are dead and some have deserted to the Prince of Parma , a clear proof of the real disposition to revolt . There is abundance of food and cattle in the country , all of which will be at our service and can not be kept from us . Everywhere there are safe and roomy harbours , almost all undefended . An invading force can be landed with ease , and there will be no lack of local pilots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Catholic English , though , of course , the larger the force , particularly if it includes cavalry , the quicker the work will be done and the less the expense . Practically there will bo nothing to overcome save an unwarlike and undisciplined mob . Sixteen times England has been invaded . Twice only the native race have repelled the attacking force . They have been defeated on every other occasion , and with a cause so holy and just as ours we need not fear to fail . The expenses shall be repaid to his Holiness and the Catholic King out of the property of the heretics and the Protestant clergy . There will be ample in these resources to compensate all who give us their hand . But the work must be done promptly . Delay will be infinitely dangerous . If we put off , as we have done hitherto , the Catholics will be tired out and reduced in numbers and strength .

The Queen of EngParties in the b/we I 15 land may herself die , a heretic Government may be reconstructed under a heretic successor , the young Scotch king or some other , and our case will then be desperate ; whereas if we can prevent this and save the Queen of Scots there will be good hope of converting her son and reducing the whole island to the obedience of the faith . Now is the moment . The French Government can not interfere . The Puke of Guise will help us for the sake of the faith and for his kinswoman . The Turks are quiet . The Church was never stronger or more united . Part of Italy is under the Catholic King ; the rest is in league with his Holiness . The revolt in the Low Countries is all but crushed . The sea provinces are on the point of surrendering . If they give up the contest their harbours will be at our service for the invasion . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England . I need not urge how much it imports his Holiness to undertake this glorious work . He , supremely wise as he is , knows that from this Jezebel cud her supporters come all the perils which disturb the Christian world . Ile knows that heretical depravity and all our other miseries can only end when this woman is chastised . Reverence for his Holiness and love for my afflicted country force me to speak . I submit to his most holy judgment myself and my advice . ' The most ardent Catholic apologist will hardly maintain , in the face of this document , that the English Jesuits and seminary priests were the innocent 116 English Seamen in the Sixteenth , Century missionaries of religion which the modern enemies of Elizabeth 's Government describe them . Father Parsons , the writer of it , was himself the leader and director of the Jesuit invasion , and can not be supposed to have misrepreseuted the purpose for which they had been sent over . The point of special interest is the account which lie gives of the state of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there that wide disposition to welcome an invading army in so large a majority of the nation ? The question is supposed to have been triumphantly answered three years later , when it is asserted that the difference of creed was forgotten , and Catholics and Protestants fought side by side for the liberties of England . But , in the first place , the circumstances were changed . The Queen of Scots no longer lived , and the success of the Armada implied a foreign sovereign . But , next , the experiment was not tried . The battle was fought at sea , by a fleet fourfifths of which was composed of Protestant adventurers , fitted out and manned by those zealous Puritans whose fidelity to the Queen Parsons himself admitted . Lord Howard may have been an Anglo-Catholie ; Roman Catholic he never was ; but he and his brother were the only loyalists in the House of Howard . Arundel and the rest of his kindred were all that Parsons claimed for them . How the country levies would have behaved had Parma landed is still uncertain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gained a first success , there might have been some who would have behaved as Sir William Stanley Parties iar. lb ( ' Stab 9 ' 17 did . It is observable that Parsons mentions Leicester and Huntingdon as the only powerful peers en whom the Queen could rely , and Leicester , otherwise the unfittest man in her dominions , she chose to command her land army . The Duke of Alva and his master Philip , both of them distrusted political priests . Political priests , they said , did not understand the facts of things . Theological enthusiasm made them credulous of what they wished . But Father Parsons 's estimate is confirmed in all its parts by the letters of Mendoza , the Spanish ambassador in London . Mendoza was himself a soldier , and his first duty was to learn the real truth . It may be taken as certain that , with the Queen of Scots still alive to succeed to the throne , at the time of the scene in the House of Commons , with which I began this lecture , the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were looking forward to the accession of a Catholic sovereign , and as a consequence to a religious revolution . It explains the difficulty of Elizabeth 's position and the inconsistency of her political action . Burghley , Walsingham , Mildrnay , Knolles , the elder Bacon , were believing Protestants , and would have had her put herself openly at the head of a Protestant European league . They believed that right and justice were on their side , that their side was God 's cause , as they called it , and that God would care for it . Elizabeth had no such complete conviction . She disliked dogmatism , Protestant as well as 118 English Seamen in the Sixteenth Century Catholic . She ridiculed Mr. Cecil and his brothers in Christ . She thought , like Erasmus , that the articles of faith , for which men were so eager to kill one another , were subjects which they knew very little about , and that every man might think what he would on such matters without injury to the commonwealth . To become head of the name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War meant war taxes , which more than half her subjects would resent and resist . Religion as she understood it was a development of law ? the law of moral conduct . You could not have two laws in one country , and you could not have two religions ; but the outward form mattered comparatively little . The people she ruled over were divided about these forms . They were mainly fools , and if she let them each have chapels and churches of their own , molehills would become mountains , and the congregations would go from arguing into fighting . With Parliament to help her , therefore , she established a Liturgy , in which those who wished to find the Mass could hear the Mass , while those who wanted predestination and justification by faith could find it in the Articles . Both could meet under a common roof , and use a common service , if they would only be reasonable . If they would not be reasonable , the Catholics might have their own ritual in their own houses , and would not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years of Elizabeth 's reign . No Catholic , she could proudly say , had ever during that time been moParties in the Stab 1 . ' 19 lestod for his belief . There was a small til ) for non-attendance at church , but even this was rarely levied , and by the confession of the Jesuits the Queen 's policy was succeeding too well . Sensible men began to see that the differences of religion were not things to quarrel over . Faith was grow ing languid . The elder generation , who had lived through the Edward and Mary revolutions , were satisfied to be left undisturbed ; a new generation was growing up , with new ideas ; and so the Church of Rome bestirred itself . Elizabeth was excommu nicated . The cycle began of intrigue and conspiracy , assassination plots , and Jesuit invasions . Punish ments had to follow , and in spite of herself Eliza beth was driven into what the Catholics could call religious persecution . Religious it was not , for the seminary priests were missionaries of treason . But religious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wished to remain loyal , without forfeiting his faith , was taught to see that a sov sovereign under the Papal curse had no longer a claim on his allegiance . If he disobeyed the Pope , he had ceased to be a member of the Church of Christ . The Papal party grew in coherence , while , opposed to them as their purpose came in view , the Prot estants , who at first had been inclined to Lutheran-ism , adopted the deeper and sterner creed of Calvin and Geneva . The memories of the Marian cruelties revived again . They saw themselves threatened with a return to stake and fagot . They closed their ranks and resolved to die rather than submit again 120 English Seamen in the Sixteenth Century to Antichrist . They might be inferior in numbers . A plebiscite in England at that moment would have sent Burghley and Walsingham to the scaffold . But the Lord could save by few as well as by many . Judah had but two tribes out of the twelve , but the words of the men of Judah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistake had been made by Parsons . He could not estimate what he could not understand . He admitted that the inhabitants of the towns were mainly heretic ? London , Bristol , Plymouth , and the rest ? but he despised them as merchants , craftsmen , mean persons who had no heart to fight in them . Nothing is more remarkable in the history of the sixteenth century than the effect of Calvinism in levelling distinctions of rank and in steeling and ennobling the character of common men . In Scotland , in the Low Countries , in France , there was the same phenomenon . In Scotland , the Kirk was the creation of the preachers and the people , and peasants and workmen dared to stand in the field against belted knights and barons , who had trampled on their fathers for centuries . The artisans of the Low Countries had for twenty years defied the whole power of Spain . The Huguenots were not a fifth part of the Frolic ! ) nation , yet defeat could never dishearten then . Again and again they forced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the same in England . The allegiance to their feudal leaders dissolved into a higher obligation to the King of kings , whose Parties in the Slate I21 elect they believed themselves to ho . Elect ion to them was not a theological phantasm , but an enlistment in the army of God . A little flock they might be , but they were a dangerous people to deal with , most of all in the towns of the sea . The sea was the element of the Reformers . The Popes had no jurisdiction over the winds and waves . Rochelle was the citadel of the Huguenots . The English merchants and mariners had wrongs of their own , perpetually renewed , which fed the bitterness of their indignation . Touch where they would in Spanish ports , the inquisitor 's hand was on their ships ' crews , and the crews , unless they denied their faith , were handed over to the stake or the galleys . The Calvinists are accused of intolerance . I fancy that even in these humane and enlightened days we should not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burn every European visitor to his dominions who would not worship Mumbo Jumbo . The Duke of Alva was not very merciful to heretics , but he tried to bridle the zeal of the Holy Office in burning the English seamen . Even Philip himself remonstrated . It was to no purpose . The Holy Office said they would think about it , but concluded to go on . I am not the least surprised if the English seamen were intolerant . I should be very much surprised if they had not been . The Queen could not protect them . They had to protect themselves as they could , and make Spanish vessels , when they could catch them , pay for the iniquities of their rulers . 122 English Seamen in the Sixteenth Century With such a temper rising on both sides , Eliza . beth 's policy had but a poor chance . She still hoped that the better sense of mankind would keep the doctrinal enthusiasts in order . Elizabeth wished her subjects would be content to live together in unity of spirit , if not in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not hatred , in righteousness of life , not in orthodoxy preached by stake and gibbet . She was content to wait and persevere . She refused to declare war . War would tear the world in pieces . Sho knew her danger . She knew that she was in constant peril of assassination . She knew that if the Protestants were crushed in Scotland , in France , and in the Low Countries , her own turn would follow . To protect insurgents avowedly would be to justify insurrection against herself . But what she would not do openly she would do secretly . What she would not do herself she let her subjects do . Thousands of English volunteers fought in Flanders for the States , and in France for the Huguenots . When the English Treasury was shut to the entreaties of Coligny or William of Orange the London citizens untied their purse-strings . Her friends in Scotland fared ill . They were encouraged by promises which were not observed , because to observe them might bring on war . They committed themselves for her sake . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owrio ? into bloody graves . Others took their places and struggled on . The Scotch Reformation was saved . Scotland was not allowed to open its arms to an invading army // to strike England across the Border . But this was held to be their sufficient recompense . They cared for their cause as well as for the English Queen , and they had their reward . If they saved her they saved their own country . She too did not lie on a bed of roses . To prevent open war she was exposing her own life to the assassin . At any moment a pistol-shot or a stab with a dagger might add Elizabeth to the list of victims . She knew it , yet she went on upon her own policy , and faced in her person her own share of the risk . One thing only she did . If she would not defend her friends and her subjects as Queen of England , she left them free to defend themselves . She allowed traitors to be hanged when they were caught at their work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fleets , to defend at their own cost the shores of England , and to teach the Spaniards to fear their vengeance . But how long was all this to last ? How long were loyal citizens to feel that they were living over a loaded mine ? throughout their own country , throughout the Continent , at Rome and at Madrid , at Brussels and at Paris , a legion of conspirators were driving their shafts under the English commonwealth . The Queen might be indifferent to her own danger , but on the Queen 's life hung the peace of the whole realm . A stroke of a poniard , a touch of a trigger , and swords would be flying from their scabbards in every county ; England would become , like France , one wild scene of anarchy and civil / . 124 English Seamen in the Sixteenth Century war . No successor had been named . The Queen refused to hear a successor declared . Mary Stuart 's hand had been in every plot since she crossed the Border . Twice the House of Commons had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life nor allow her hopes of the crown to be taken from her . The Bond of Association was but a remedy of despair , and the Act of Parliament would have passed for little in the tempest which would immediately rise . The agony reached a height when the fatal news came from the Netherlands that there at last assassination had done its work . The Prince of Orange , after many failures , had been finished , and a libel was found in the Palace at Westminster exhorting the ladies of the household to provide a Judith among themselves to rid the world of the English Holofernes . One part of Elizabeth 's subjects , at any rate , were not disposed to sit down in patience under the eternal nightmare . From Spain was to come the army of deliverance for which the Jesuits were so passionately longing . To the Spaniards the Pope was looking for the execution of the Bull of Deposition . Father Parsons had left out of his estimate the Protestant adventurers of London and Plymouth , who , besides their creed and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might talk of peace , and perhaps in weariness might at times seriously wish for it ; but between the Englishmen whose life was on the ocean and the Spanish Inquisition , which had burned so many of them , there Parties in the l was no peace possible . To them , Spain was the natural enemy . Among the daring spirits NFL() ) ei , I sailed with Drake round the globe , who had w ay laid the Spanish gold ships , and startled the world w ith their exploits , the joy of whose lives had been to fight Spaniards wherever they could meet with them , there was but one wish ? for an honest open war . The great galleons were to them no objects of terror . The Spanish naval power seemed to them a Colossus stuffed with clouts . ' They were Protestants all of them , but their theology was rather practical than speculative . If Italians and Spaniards chose . to believe in the Mass , it was not any affair of theirs . Their quarrel was with the insolent pretence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cannon . The spirit which was working in them was the genius of freedom . On their own element they felt that they could be the spiritual tyrants ' masters . But as things were going , rebellion was likely to break out at home ; their homesteads might be burning , their country overrun with the Prince of Parma 's army , the Inquisition at their own doors , and a Catholic sovereign bringing back the fagots of Smithfield . The Reformation at its origin was no introduction of novel heresies . It was a revolt of the laity of Europe against the profligacy and avarice of the clergy . The popes and cardinals pretended to be the representatives of Heaven . When called to account for abuse of their powers , they had behaved precisely as mere corrupt human kings and aristoc126 English Seamen in the Sixteenth Century racies behave . They had intrigued ; they had excommunicated ; they had set nation against nation , sovereigns against their subjects ; they had encouraged assassination ; they had made themselves infamous by horrid massacres , and had taught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The hearts of the poor English seamen whose comrades had been burnt at Seville to make a Spanish holiday , thrilled with a sacred determination to end such scenes . The purpose that was in them broke into a wild war-music , as the wind harp swells and screams under the breath of the storm . I found in the Record Office an unsigned letter of some inspired old sea - dog , written in a bold round hand and addressed to Elizabeth . The ships ' companies which in summer served in Philip 's men-of-war went in winter in thousands to catch cod on the Banks of Newfoundland . Give me five vessels , ' the writer said , and I will go out and sink them all , and the galleons shall rot in Cadiz Harbour for want of hands to sail them . But decide , Madam , and decide quickly . Time flies , and will not return . The wings of man 's life are plumed with the feathers of death . ' The Queen did not decide . The five ships were not sent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But in spite of herself Elizabeth was driven forward by the tendencies of things . The death of the Prince of Orange left the States without a Government . The Prince of Parma was pressing them hard . Without a leader they were Parties ' in the b'latr 1 ' 27 lost . They offered themselves to hlizabott. , incorporated in the English Empire . Tiwy halt ( that if she refused they must either submit to S ii ti n or become provinces of France . The Netherlands , whether Spanish or French , would be equally dangerous to England . The Netherlands once brought back under the Pope , England 's turn would come next ; while to accept the proposal meant instant and desperate war , both with France and Spain too ? for France would never allow England again to gain a foot on the Continent . Elizabeth knew not what to do . She would and she would not . She did not accept ; she did not refuse . It was neither No nor Yes . Philip , who was as fond of indirect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The harvest had failed in Galicia , and the population were starving . England grew more corn than she wanted , and , under a special promise that the crews should not be molested , a fleet of corn-traders had gone with cargoes of grain to Coruna , Bilbao , and Santander . The King of Spain , on hearing that Elizabeth was treating with the States , issued a sudden order to seize the vessels , confiscate the cargoes , and imprison the men . The order was executed . One English ship only was lucky enough to escape by the adroitness of her commander . The Primrose , of London , lay in Bilbao Roads with a captain and fifteen hands . The mayor , on receiving the order , came on board to look over the ship . He then went on shore for a sufficient force to carry out the seizure . After he was gone the captain 128 English Seamen in the Sixteenth Century heard of the fate which was intended for him . The mayor returned with two boatloads of soldiers , stepped up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told him he was a prisoner . The Englishmen snatched pike and cutlass , pistol and battle-axe , killed seven or eight of the Spanish boarders , threw the rest overboard , and flung stones on them as they scrambled into their boats . The mayor , who had fallen into the sea , caught a rope and was hauled up when the fight was over . The cable was cut , the sails hoisted , and in a few minutes the Primrose was under way for England , with the mayor of Bilbao below the hatches . No second vessel got away . If Philip had meant to frighten Elizabeth he could not have taken a worse means of doing it , for he had exasperated that particular part of the English population which was least afraid of him . He had broken faith besides , and had seized some hundreds of merchants and sailors who had gone merely to relieve Spanish distress . Elizabeth , as usual , would not act herself . She sent no ships from her own navy to demand reparation ; but she gave the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determined to read Spain a lesson which should make an impression . They had the worst fears for the fate of the prisoners ; but if they could not save , they could avenge them . Sir Francis Drake , who wished for nothing better than to be at work again , volunteered his services , and a fleet was collected at Plymouth of twentyfive sail , every one of them fitted out by private enParties in the State ferprise . No finer armament , certainly no 1 ) ( . t terequipped armament , ever left the English shores . The expenses were , of course , enormous . Of seamen and soldiers there were between two and three thousand . Drake 's name was worth an army . The cost was to be recovered out of the expedition somehow ; the Spaniards were to be made to pay for it ; but how or when was left to Drake 's judgment . This time there was no second in command sent by the friends of Spain to hang upon his arm . By universal consent he had the absolute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ports into the meaning of the arrest . Beyond that he was left to go where he pleased and do what he pleased on his own responsibility . The Queen said frankly that if it proved convenient she intended to disown him . Drake had no objection to being disowned , so he could teach the Spaniards to be more careful how they handled Englishmen . What came of it will be the subject of the next lecture . Father Parsons said the Protestant traders of England had grown effeminate and dared not fight . In the ashes of their own smoking cities the Spaniards had to learn that Father Parsons had misread his countrymen . If Drake had been given to heroics he might have left Virgil 's lines inscribed above the broken arms of Castile at St. Domingo : En ego victa situ quam veri effeta senectus Arma inter regum falsa formidine ludit : Respice ad haet . LECTURE VI THE GREAT EXPEDITION TO THE WEST INDIES QUEEN EI , izAnirnH and her brother-in-law of Spain were reluctant champions of opposing principles . In themselves they had no wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and circumstance  --  Philip by the genius of the Catholic religion , Elizabeth by the enthusiasts for freedom and by the advice of statesmen who saw no safety for her except in daring . Both wished for peace , and refused to see that peace was impossible ; but both were compelled to yield to their subjects ' eagerness . Philip had to threaten England with invasion ; Elizabeth had to show Philip that England had a long arm , which Spanish wisdom would do well to fear . It was a singular position . Philip had outraged orthodoxy and dared the anger of Rome by maintaining an ambassador at Elizabeth 's Court after her excommunication . He had laboured for a reconciliation with a sincerity which his secret letters make it impossible to doubt . Ho had condescended even to sue for it , in spite of Drake and the voyage of the Pelican ; yet he had helped the Pope to set Ireland in a flame . He had encouraged Elizabeth 's Catholic subjects in conspiracy after The Great Expedition to the 1:31 conspiracy . He had approved of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Prince ef Orange . Elizabeth had retaliated , though with half a heart , by letting her soldiers volunteer into the service of the revolted Netherlands , by permitting English privateers to plunder the Spanish colonies , seize the gold ships , and revenge their own wrongs . Each , perhaps , had wished to show the other what an open war would cost them both , and each drew back when war appeared inevitable . Events went their way . Holland and Zeeland , driven to extremity , had petitioned for incorporation with England ; as a counter-stroke and a warning , Philip had arrested the English corn ships and imprisoned the owners and the crews . Her own fleet was nothing . The safety of the English shores depended on the spirit of the adventurers , and she could not afford to check the anger with which the news was received . To accept the offer of the States was war , and war she would not have . Herself , she would not act at all ; but in her usual way she might let her subjects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in excuse for the Inquisition , that she could not restrain them . And thus it was that in September 1585 , Sir Francis Drake found himself with a fleet of twenty-five privateers and 2,500 men who had volunteered to serve with him under his own command . He had no distinct commission . The expedition had been fitted out as a private undertaking . Neither officers nor crews had been engaged for the service of the 132 English Seamen in the Sixteenth Century Crown . They received no wages . In the eye of the law they were pirates . They were going on their own account to read the King of Spain a necessary lesson and pay their expenses at the King of Spain 's cost . Young Protestant England had taken fire . The name of Drake set every Protestant heart burning , and hundreds of gallant gentlemen had pressed in to join . A grandson of Burghley had come , and Edward Winter the Admiral 's son , and Francis Knolles the Queen 's cousin , ILIA Martin Frobisher , and Christopher Carlile . Philip Sidney had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philip Sidney was needed elsewhere . The Queen 's consent had been won from her at a bold interval in her shifting moods . The hot fit might pass away , and Burghley sent Drake a hint to be off before her humour changed . No word was said . On the morning of the 14th of September the signal flag was flying from Drake 's maintop to up anchor and away . Drake , as he admitted after , was not the most assured of her Majesty 's perseverance to let them go forward . ' Past Ushant he would be beyond reach of recall . With light winds and calms they drifted across the bay . They fell in with a few Frenchmen homeward-bound from the Banks , and let them pass uninjured . A large Spanish ship which they met next day , loaded with excellent fresh salt fish , was counted lawful prize . The fish was new and good , and was distributed through the fleet . Standing leisurely on , they cleared Finisterre and came up with the Isles of The Great Expedition to tilt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ la ' how . They dropped anchor there , and it was a gre , Lt matter and a royal sight to see them . ' The Spanish Governor , Don Pedro Bemadero , sent off with some astonishment to know who and what they were . Drake answered with a question whether England and Spain were at war , and if not why the English merchants had been arrested . Don Pedro could but say that he knew of no war , and for the merchants an order had come for their release . For reply Drake landed part of his force on the islands , and Don Pedro , not knowing what to make of such visitors , found it best to propitiate them with cartloads of wine and fruit . The weather , which had been hitherto fine , showed signs of change . The wind rose , and the sea with it . The anchorage was exposed , and Drake sent Christopher Carlile with one of his ships and a few pinnaces , up the harbour to look out for better shelter . Their appearance created a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their boats , carrying off their property and their Church plate . Carlile , who had a Calvinistic objection to idolatry , took the liberty of detaining part of these treasures . From one boat he took a massive silver cross belonging to the High Church at Vigo ; from another an image of Our Lady , which the sailors relieved of her clothes and were said , when she was stripped , to have treated with some indignity . Carlile 's report being satisfactory , the whole fleet was brought the next day up the harbour and moored above the town . 134 English Seamen in the Sixteenth Century The news had by this time spread into the country . The Governor of Galicia came down with all the force which he could collect in a hurry . Perhaps he was in time to save Vigo itself . Perhaps Drake , having other aims in view , did not care to be detained over a smaller object . The Governor , at any rate , saw that the English were too strong for him to meddle with . The best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go away on the easiest terms . Drake and he met in boats for a parley . Drake wanted water and fresh provisions . Drake was to to be allowed to furnish himself undisturbed . He had secured what he most wanted . He had shown the King of Spain that he was not invulnerable in his own home dominion , and he sailed away unmolested . Madrid was in consternation . That the English could dare insult the first prince in Europe on the sacred soil of the Peninsula itself seemed like a dream . The Council of State sat for three days considering the meaning of it . Drake 's name was already familiar in Spanish ears . It was not conceivable that he had come only to inquire after the arrested ships and seamen . But what could the English Queen be about ? Did she not know that she existed only by the forbearance of Philip ? Did she know the King of Spain 's force ? Did not she and her people quake ? Little England , it was said by some of these councillors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of half the world . The old Admiral Santa Cruz was less confident about the swallowing . Ile observed that England // had many teeth , and that instead of boasting of Spanish greatness it would be better to provide against what she might do with them . Till now the corsairs had appeared only in twos and threes . With such a fleet behind him Drake might go where he pleased . He might be going to the South Seas again . He might take Madeira if he liked , or the Canary Islands . Santa Cruz himself thought he would make for the West Indies and Panama , and advised the sending out there instantly every available ship that they had . The gold fleet was Drake 's real object . He had information that it would be on its way to Spain by the Cape de Verde Islands , and he had learnt the time when it was to be expected . From Vigo he sailed for the Canaries , looked in at Palma , with intention to have taken our pleasure there , ' but found the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He ran on to the Cape de Verde Islands . He had measured his time too narrowly . The gold fleet had arrived and had gone . He had missed it by twelve hours , the reason , ' as he said with a sigh , best known to God . ' The chance of prize money was lost , but the political purpose of the expedition could still be completed . The Cape de Verde Islands could not sail away , and a beginning could be made with Sant Iago . Sant Iago was a thriving , well-populated town , and down in Drake 's book as specially needing notice , some Plymouth sailors having been recently murdered there . Christopher Carlile , always handy and 136 English Seamen in the Sixteenth Century trustworthy , was put on shore with a thousand men to attack the place on the undefended side . The Spanish commander , the bishop , and most of the people fled , as at Vigo , into the mountains with their plate and money . Carlile entered without opposition , and flew St. George 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Drake came in , landed the rest of his force , and took possession . It happened to be the 17th of November ? the anniversary of the Queen 's accession ? and ships and batteries , dressed out with English flags , celebrated tho occasion with salvoes of cannon . Houses and magazines were then searched and plundered . Wine was found in largo quantities , rich merchandise for the Indian trade , and other valuables . Of gold and silver nothing ? it had all been removed . Drake waited for a fortnight , hoping that the Spaniards would treat for the ransom of the city . When they made no sign , he marched twelve miles inland to a village where the Governor and the Bishop were said to have taken refuge . But the village was found deserted . The Spaniards had gone to the mountains , where it was useless to follow them , and were too proud to bargain with a pirate chief . Sant Iago was a beautifully built city , and Drake would perhaps have spared it ; but a ship-boy who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order was given to burn . louses , magazines , churches , public buildings were turned to ashes , and the work being finished Drake went on , as Santa Cruz expected , for the Spanish West The Great Expe ( iifuont to the II ' , st hot " , . , Indies . The Spaniards were magnificent in all that they did and touched . They built their cities in their new possessions on the most splendid models of the Old World . St. Domingo and Carthagena had their castles and cathedrals , palaces , squares , and streets , grand and solid as those at Cadiz and Seville , and raised as enduring monuments of the power and greatness of the Castilian monarchs . To these Drake meant to pay a visit . Beyond them was the Isthmus , where he had made his first fame and fortune , with Panama behind , the depot of the Indian treasure . So far all had gone well with him . He had taken what he wanted out of Vigo ; he had destroyed Sant Ingo and had not lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to deal with than Spanish galleons or Spanish garrisons . He was in the heat of the tropics . Yellow fever broke out and spread through the fleet . Of those who caught the infection few recovered , or recovered only to be the wrecks of themselves . It was swift in its work . In a few days more than two hundred had died . But the north-east trade blew merrily . The fleet sped on before it . In eighteen days they were in the roads at Dominica , the island of brooks and rivers and fruit . Limes and lemons and oranges were not as yet . But there were leaves and roots of the natural growth , known to the Caribs as antidotes to the fever , and the Caribs , when they learnt that the English were the Spaniards ' enemies , brought them this precious remedy and taught them the use of it . The ships were washed and ventilated , 138 English Seamen in the Sixteenth Century and the water casks refilled . The infection seemed to have gone as suddenly as it appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at St. Kitts , which was then uninhabited . A council of war was held to consider what should be done next . St. Domingo lay nearest to them . It was the finest of all the Spanish colonial cities . It was the capital of the West Indian Government , the great centre of West Indian commerce . In the cathedral , before the high altar , lay Columbus and his brother Diego . In natural wealth no island in the world outrivals Espinola , where the city stood . A vast population had collected there , far away from harm , protected as they supposed , by the majesty of the mother country , the native inhabitants almost exterminated , themselves undreaming that any enemy could approach them from the ocean , and therefore negligent of defence and enjoying themselves in easy security . Drake was to give them a new experience and a lesson for the future . On their way across from St. Kitts the adventurers overhauled a small vessel bound to the same port as they were . From the crew of this vessel they learnt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so many others in the West Indies , by a long sandspit , acting as a natural breakwater . The entrance was a narrow inlet at the extremity of the spit , and batteries had been mounted there to cover it . To land on the outer side of the sandbank was made impossible by the The Great Expedition to thr West Indies 130 surf . There was one sheltered point only where boats could go on shore , but this was ten miles distant from the town . Ten miles was but a morning 's march . Drako went in himself in a pinnace , surveyed the landingplace , and satisfied himself of its safety . The plan of attack at Sant Iago was to be exactly repeated . On New Year 's Eve Christopher Carlile was again landed with half the force in the fleet . Drake remained with the rest , and prepared to force the entrance of the harbour if Carlile succeeded . Their coming had been seen from the city . The alarm had been given , and the women and children , the money in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all kinds , were sent off inland as a precaution . Of regular troops there seem to have been none , but in so populous a city there was no difficulty in collecting a respectable force to defend it . The hidalgos formed a body of cavalry . The people generally were unused to arms , but they were Spaniards and brave men , and did not mean to leave their homes without a fight for it . Carlile lay still for the night . He marched at eight in the morning on New Year 's Day , advanced leisurely , and at noon found himself in front of the wall . So far he had met no resistance , but a considerable body of horse ? gentlemen and their servants chiefly ? charged down on him out of the bush and out of the town . He formed into a square to receive them . They came on gallantly , but were received with pike and shot , and after a few attempts gave                 @ @ @ @
