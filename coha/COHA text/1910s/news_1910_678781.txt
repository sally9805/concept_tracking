If the charge Can be proved it stamps two members of the Senate as unfit tti sit in that body . If it is untrue It stamps one Senator as unfit . " The statement ' Which has given rise to the trouble was made by Senator Conger at a conference held at the Hotel Ten Eyck , is this attn. on the evening of Jan. 4 , in - which seven of the eight Republican Senators who refused to support Senator AllcIs for President pro tern , took part .

Conger Regrets He Caine Ont . Senator Conger made a statement this evening in which he explained that when he made the charges against Senator Ands he believed that the implied pledge of secrecy under which men speak their minds freely at a caucus . would be respected in this Instance . He charged that the publication or what he had said involved a direct breach of confidence on the part of some one among the six other Senators . Nobody regrets this publication as much as I do , " said Senator Conger . " It was not my intention to make any trouble ' for Senator Allis . Joe is a pretty good fellow . Nor did I intend to reflect on the Republican organization . What has happened in connection with this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confidence , " We were assembled at our little conference where we were drawing U13 a report in which our reasons for not support .. ing Senator Allds were to be set-forth . Each one of us had something to say about the Senator We talked about him for some time with perfect freedom , and some pretty-hard and pointed things were being said against him . When it came to , me I stated my reasons . I did so with the distinct understanding that . we were in secret conference and that not a word of what was said was to be made public . It never occurred to me that any one of the six other men would take it upon himself to violate his pledge . Nevertheless I learned the very next day that Senator Allds had full knowledge of an that occurred at the conference . says Re Could Tell Worse Things . " Now , the whole thing , to my mind , does not amount to a great deal . Further than that , it all occurred eight or nine Years ago , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We knew each ' other - very ' well . We were on committees together . I knew just what sort of a man he was . Why , that matter between ' us was a mere drop in the bucket in coin-. parison with some of the things that were being pulled off at Albany in those days . " The Black Horse Cavalry was in the saddle then-you know that as well as Iand very little got by them . Those days were different from the present . The . performance of the famous Black . - Horse. is a matter of inside legislative history . suppose ovn9 -- entrO4herek is a hearing . Strike bills Were being introduced on all sides . It was blackmail all along the line . It was a question of Pay . pay , Pay " It was thoroughly understood . Nobody thought anything particular of that in those days . Now it is all different . " It was not easy to find Senator Conger o get the statement from him . After e learned that the charges had been published he left his quarters in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some time before he was located this evening in the office of , the Canton laridge Company , in which he is financially interested . The office found was at the rear of a downtown office building . and was reached through a dark and devious corridor . At first the Senator declined to make any statement . " If the accounts which have appeared are garbled , wo n't you tell just what you said at the caucus ? " the Senator was asked . No , I prefer not to . " he replied . " ' What I have said for publication has been with a view of setting myself right In this matter and in order that my motives should not be misunderstood . The stories which were in circulation here in Albany to-day concerning our caucus were all garbled and exaggerated , and I made Public my side of the case to-day for : he purpose of preventing publication of these misstatements . Nothing can be gained front our point of view by making public the accusations . Senator Allds is the President pro tem of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ends the matter . " Fears He , Not 4 " Joe : . WIR Staffer . " What action do you think the Senate will take ? " he was asked . " Why , I presume a committee will be appointed to investigate , and that Joe will be exonerated . I am the goat all right . The informer always gets the worst of it . And , yet I am neither a squealer nor a knocker . You should have heard what some of the other fellows at the conference said . As I said . I never intended that this should become public . I told it to men who , I assumed , were my friends , and who , I thought . could be trusted . I ant greatly surprised that any of thorn betrayed that confidence . " " ' What do you think the effect of this accusation will he on you , in case Senator Ands is exonerated ? " " Well . I suspect whatever hack fire there is will strike me . Oh . I guess may as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ended . " When the Senate convened for the week last evening . there were rumors that an explosion eef same sort was imminent . Rumors with ref .. e. , rise to the allegations made by Senater Conger at the conference of the insurgents have been eurrent about the Capitol for the last ten day. , but none of the Si imams who attended would admit any knowledge of the matter , though the y had been frequently approached . Senator Allds shrugged his shoulders wip the subject was broached to hirn , but dialined to make any statement . Others Refuse to Tollt . The attitude of the insurgents with reference to the Allds-conger episode had not changed tee-day . All were exceedingly reticent . " I knot " nothine about it and have nothing to say . " said Senator Davenport . " At the present time there is nothing I can say- regarding the matter , " said Senator e'eweemee . " Whatever I learned at the conference , " said Senator Rose of Orange . " came to me in strictest confidence and I shall keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formal statement by anybody haying authority to make such a demand . " Senator Brackett of Saratoga declined point-blank to make any statement with reference to the episode . Senator Agnew of New York said lie had not been feeling well on the night in question and did not have an opportunity to follow closely what was said . Senator Hinman of Itroome ( lid not come to the Capitol this week . At his committee room it was said that he was attending to some important legal business in Binghamton . The old line leaders in the Senate who are closely affiliated with the machine . and the insurgents . too . are awaiting to- , morrow lend its developments with anxiety and foreboding . To the Republican machine . already weakened by differences within the organization on the eve of a State election . this new and sensational attack comes with stunning force . No matter whether or not Senator Allds should be exonerated. the machine leaders admit-that a condition where allegations of this nature can be launched against a Man chosen to direct his party 's policy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Panic has prevaled to-day about the legislative precincts , and wherever legislators and politicians lace met in the lobbies of hotels or the lounging rooms at the Capitol . It is said that State Chairman Woodruff will i-e here to-morrow to attempt to clear the muddle . Albin Mire Retire Temporarily . It is said that to-morrow some other Senator will he called upon to take the leadersnip pending an investigation of the Conger charges . In the absence of Senator Allds no step has been taken with a view of arranging for the investigation he is expected to demand . It . was intimated . however , that it would be within the power of the Senate to order an enquiry behind closed doors . If precedent is followed , however , the hearings will be open . The most recent investigation of its kind occurred in 1895. when Senator Raines demanded . an investigation in regard to an article printed in The New York Press . The article was written by Lemuel Ely Quigg , and contained bribery charges in connection with a firemen 's bill . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counsel . Sanator Raines was vindicated . This has been the history of nearly all bribery investigatio:a , in the Senate from those in connection with the Erie Railroad contest , the Bank of America , and the metropolitan Fire Department bills in the sixties until the present time . Antis May Show Platt ILettersFriends of Senator Alids in the upper house declare that he w ill be abundantly able to show his innocence of the accusation brought e gaiitst him . Senator Allds , it was said , had had his files at his law office in Norwich examined and would come to the investigation prepared to prove that if money was paid to anybody In connection with the bridge bills it was not to him . It was intimated that correspondenee bet ween him and ex-Senator Platt . who was leader of the Republican State organization when Allds w ' is majority leader of the Assembly , might figure in the inquiry . Senator Ands has . intimated to his friends that he would have the record of fete man who is making the charges against him looked into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name had appeared in connection with the payment of money to affect legislation in other States . Senator Conger denied that this was the case . He admitted that he had been financially interested in bridge companies that had been indicted by the courts in Massachusetts and ih Ohio . How Conner Made 81s Revelation . The Conger statement was not made openly to the conference at first . Senators Brackett and Newcomb were busy drafting the statement which subsequently was given to the press in explanation of their failure to support Senator Allds . Senator Agnew was reclining on his bed , as he did not feel well . The other four Senators were lounging about the room , and there was a hum of general conversation . " All of a sudden . in the buzz of conversation that was going on in the room , " said . the Senator who was telling the story . " I felt the grip of the Senator seated next to me on my wrist . ' Keep quiee ' he said , ' Conger is talking about ... Mids. and what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that time the others , too , were aware that Conger was saying something interesting in conversational tone to a member of the conference with whom he was talking . A hush fell on the room at once . We were all ears . " After Conger had finished talking we were completely flabbergasted . We could hardly realize the meaning of what he had said . The silence hung heavy over the room for a full minute at least . Finally one asked Senator Conger some questions in order to remove all doubt as to his statement . Then somebody changed the subject , and Senators Brackett and Newcomb , having completed their work of drafting . the report was read and adopted . We made no reference to the Conger allegations in it , and we did not even stay long enough to sign it before - we dispersed . so sick were we from what we had heard and so anxious were we to get away from the room . " To Show Secrets of Ninow 's Day . It is believed here that if the investigation be , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when S. Fred Nixon was Speaker of the Assembly will be brought out . There are many survivors from the Nixon legusao in Me Lesislature Speaker Nixon was the Czar of the lower house at the time Mr. Ands was majority leader . The fate of legislation . in those days was virtually decided by the Speaker , with a little group of Senators , including Ellsworth , Coggeshall , aialby , and Raines . In the Assembly Allds cast in his lot with the clique that clustered about Speaker Nixon . The Nixon " ring . " as it was called , became notorious in its day , not through its power alone , but through its subservience to the machine , then ruled by Platt . It was during those days the bills , which figure in the Conger. allegations , were introduced . There was a series of them running through the years from 1900 to 1903 . These bills , according to Senator Conger , and as the records of the Legislature show , deprived the local boards of townships and villages of the power to authorize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a system of public bidding and contract letting and involved advertising for long periods and supervision by the State Engineer . HOW THE CHARGE WAS MADE . Account of Conger 's Revelation Given by The Evening Post . Revelation of the there of bribery made by Senator Conger against Senator Allds was made yesterday in The Evening Post . It told of the conference in the Hotel Ten Eyck of the seven Senators ? Agnew and Newcomb of New York , Hinman of Broome , Rose of Orange , Davenport of Clinton , Brackett of Saratoga , and Conger of Tompkins  --  who refused to go into the Republican Senate caucus on the evening of Jan : 4. and said that in the course of their conversation one said to Senator Conger : " Bean , do you personally know that Jo Allds took the stuff ? " " Yes , " came Conger 's unhesitating reply , " I personally know he received money for aiding in the defeat of legislation , when he was Republican leader of the Assembly . " The Evening Post 's account of Conger 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested for years in some bridge companies doing a legitimate business in building and repairing highway bridges , said Conger . One day came menace in the shape of a bill introduced in the Legislature to take front town boards throughout the State the right to order new bridaes and repair work which should cost more than $500 . " There had been no demand for the rneasuro by the people of any town , declared Conger . The very backers of the bill , as far as lie knew , had not adduced any convincing- reason for the new law , which was to put additional power into the hands of the State engineers and to require towns to vote upon all outlays above the $500 limit . Apprehension on the part of the bridge builders had been aroused . " By his own influence Conger , then Assemblyman , had held back this highway end bridge bill in committee that first year , lie told the listening six . But the reposing year his influence was not sufiteirlit . " He heard more or less directly that the measure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it meant to Conger and his associates a loss of 60 per cent . Of a business they had built up from small beginnings ; it would frustrate their efforts to make invested capital pay dividends and would throw laborers out of employment it meant a setback for the good-road movement , he said ; there would be bridge accidents because of the failure properly to repair bridges . " So , in self-defense , ' to prdtect themselves against legislative injustice . as Conger put it . money was paid not merely to one of the leaders . but to more than one , some of whom are now dead . " Apparently a sense of injury ? he and his associates paid bribe money for some year : , and then saw the bill go through , despite their cash ( GO per cent . of their business vanishing precisely as they had foreseen ) ? prevented his realization of the full significance of what he was saying . But the six listeners in the Ten Eyck zoom realized this  --  realized it all . " It stirred the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After a hot discussion , flavored by wonder and crossquestioning , seven names were signed to a manifesto announcing that they would not stand for Allds for Senate leader . They put nothing in the manifesto about thousand-dollar bills and legislative corruption . The revelation had come too suddenly for incorporating this . But there had been no secrecy agreed upon . And as they went to their homes  --  the Senate adjourned the next day  --  they talked this thing over among themselves , and , gradually , with others . " Finally a Senator took the story to Allds himself . Then the murder was out ; no further concealment was possible . " In order to verify the story of Senator Conger 's charge a report of the alleged conversation was submitted to Senator Conger in Albany on Sunday . According to The Evening Post he said : " The report you show me is in some respects erroneous , and , rather than permit a mistaken account to be published , 1 will explain my refusal to vote for Senator Alids for President pro tem. of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reiterated the expression of the sentiment drawn up by the seven bolting Senators as published . He was then asked : " Did you not have further reasons ? " His answer was : " I did . I had personal knowledge that when Republican leader of the Assembly he received money for aiding in the defeat of legislation before that body . " Question  --  What was the history of that bill ? Answer ? It was an amendment to the highway law . It was first introduced in 1900 and was referred to the Committee of Internal Affairs in the Assembly of which I was a member . I believed that the bill was not in the best interests . of the State , and that the people behind the bill a-ere not sincere In their desire to pass it . I knew that if it passed it would - uin the business in New York State for several companies in which I was interested . and that there was no demand on the part of town boards for the passage . In 1900 the bill was held in committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus became exposed to attack ; In 1901 the bill was again introduced and the threat was made that it would be passed unless certain persons were " retained . " Leader Allds , it was declared , was one of those " retained . " Question  --  Who were the others besides Allds ? Answer  --  Some are dead , others are out of public affairs , and I will not name them . Quests in ? Howdo you come to have personal knowledge of the transaction ? Answer ? My company was one of the victims of the hold-up . I will be ready to state the facts , - the exact truth , before any regularly constituted committee of the Senate . ALLDS MADE A PROTEST . Wanted Opportunity to Prepare a Re . ply Before Charges Were Printed . II A protest against the publication of the charges against him was made yesterday by Senator Allds . He sent the following letter by early mail from Albany : Mr. 0 , G Villard . President of The New York Evening Post Company . My Dear Sir : I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favor under date of Jan. 17 , which was left at the club where I live last evening at midnight , and I desire to avail myself . ' of the suggestion that you would be happy to rereceive from me by 10 o'clock any statement which I desire to make . Likewise , referring to our personal conversation on Saturday morning last , I beg to say that I understood distinctly that yOu would personally be in Albany bn Monday . and would either call yourself or have your representative call on me in my office in the Capitol . I was in the office from 10 o'clock in the morning until 10 o'clock last evening . except only during the dinner hour from 6:30 until 8 , and during the time of the session from 8:30 until 9:15. when I was , of course , in the Senate Chamber . I understood distinctly that before you would give any credence to what you yourself regard as a serious charge , and which I pointed out to you must have been a hasty angry remark on the part of Senator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full statement both of my record on bridge and highway legislation by an examination of the journal , and , likewise , an examination of the record of Senator Conger as bearing upon what must have been his motive in making any statement which you advise me be made . You not having shown me the statement which you advise me in the letter you propose to publish , I can not , of course , reply at this moment to the same ; but I can assure you that , speaking for myself , any statement implying either the offer of or ' the acceptance of money to influence my action at the time when I was leader in the Assembly Is absolutely untrue : that whoever utters the same is , in legal language , a slanderer , and certainly it would he libelous to publish it . If any such statement which has been made to you , such as you convey in your letter , is true , it is evident that there are two Senators now serving in the Senate who ought not to be representing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that sort is made . I shall embrace the first opportunity when the Senate is in full legislative session to take prompt steps to determine what are the actual facts , because he being at that time an Assemblyman , as I was , it will occur to any thinking man that each was guilty , if there is any foundation for the allegation . I am at present engaged in preparing a definite history of all action which I have taken during my entire legislative career on highway matters , and ' I am , also , endeavoring to trace the record of the other Senator , both while he has been in public , life and also the record of himself and his companies in this State and three adjoining States . I , therefore . beg to suggest that , before any publication is made , such a conference and examination , either by yourself or your representative . as you assured me in your office would be had , should take place , and that , pending such examination , it is bitterly unfair to the writer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unwise and not in accordance with the general policy of the paper of which you have the honor to be controlling owner and editor . Should you , after reading this letter , accept the suggestion that we ought to carry out the agreement we made the other day of careful examination , please consider this letter strictly confidential and personal . If , however , you are determined to follow the line indicated in your note of last evening , you may print this in a parallel column with whatever statement you have in mind . and , later , you will have an opportunity to print my definite reply . Yours very truly , JOTHAM P. ALLDS . Albany . Jan. ' 18 . In a note by the editor of The Evening Post on this letter it is said that senator Allds " is in error in assuming that any extended conference with him was suggesed at the meeting in New York on Saturday to which he refers , or that there was any such agreement as he alleges . The Evening Post made its own investigation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as by letter , of Senator Conger 's charge , just as soon as this was given to The Evening Post in Albany last evening . The general nature of the charge was discussed with him last Saturday . and lie was then asked for any statement he cared to make . "
