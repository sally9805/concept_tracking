The action begins in semi-darkness , out of which sound invisible choirs . The scene is the cave of SETEBOS , whose stark-colored idol  --  half tiger and half toad  --  colossal and primitive  --  rises at centre above a stone altar . On the right , the cave leads inward to the abode of SYCORAX ; on the left , it leads outward to the sea , a blue-green glimpse of which is vaguely visible . High in the tiger-jaws of the idol , ARIEL  --  a slim , winged figure , half nude  --  is held fettered . In the dimness , he listens to deep-bellowing choirs from below , answered by a chorus of sweet shrill voices from within . THE VOICES FROM BELOW Sing . Setebos ! Setebos ! THE VOICES FROM WITHIN Sing . Ariel ! ARIEL Calls aloud . O , my brave spirits ! THE VOICES FROM BELOW Setebos ! Setebos ! Over us which art , and under : &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fang of fireFrom mouth of thunder ! &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hungering goad &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and toad  --  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Setebos !

Thou art Setebos ! THE VOICES FROM WITHIN Seald in a starless cell , &nbsp; &nbsp; We are shut from dawn and sky.Ariel !  --  Ariel ! &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Why ? ARIEL Setebos knows , but his jaws Fetter me fast : he is dumb  --  Answering never . THE VOICES FROM WITHIN We , who parch for dew and star  --  &nbsp; &nbsp; Ariel !  --  Ariel !  --  Must we perish where we are ? &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tell ! ARIEL Sycorax knows , but she sits There in the cave with her son  --  Mocking us ever . THE VOICES FROM WITHIN Ariel ! p. 3 ARIEL Call me no more , Lest they torment us . I hear them Coming now . SYCORAX Caliban ! ARIEL Hush ! Gigantic , the twisted form of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sea . Come , fish-fowl ! Leave thy flapping in the mud And keep thy father 's temple . Call his priests . Thy father Toad 's a god , hath double teeth In his two heads . The Tiger loins of him Begot thee in my belly for a cub To lick his paws and purr , else he may pinch thee Behind an eye-tooth , like yon flitter mouse That hangs there wriggling . CALIBAN So , so Sycorax !  --  Coming ! SYCORAX Aye , so so : crawling still ! Malformed and hissing , CALIBAN enters on his belly and arms . CALIBAN Syc-Syco- Sycorax ! See ! SYCORAX What hast thou got thee ? CALIBAN Laughs , half rising , and holds up a wriggling creature . Got A little god  --  a little Caliban . Ha !  --  make him out of mud . See : Squeezed it round And slipped him through my fist-hole . Am a god : Rising. p. 4 See Sycorax  --  her grandchild ! SYCORAX ' T is an eel-worm . Fling him to the white bat yonder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idol . Ariel , Here 's food for thee : a wormling for thy beak . So , my trapped bird :  --  How sayst , ha ? ARIEL Sings . " Where the bee sucks there suck I. " CALIBAN Laughing . Bee , sayst thou ? Still buzzest of thy wings , and eatest  --  air ! ARIEL Sings . " In a cowslip 's bell I lie . " CALIBAN My father 's gullet is no cowslip 's bell . Shalt lie in the belly of Setebos . Tossing away the eel.  --  What waitest for ? ARIEL I am waiting for one who will come . CALIBAN Aye ? Who will come ? ARIEL One from the heart of the world ; and he shall rise On tempest of music and in thunder of song . CALIBAN Gaping. p. 5 Thunder and tempest  --  so ! ARIEL With ecstasy . I see him now . CALIBAN Crouching back . See him ! Where , now ? ARIEL In my dream :  --  He bears A star-wrought staff and hooded cloak of blue , And on his right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moon ; and these he makes his masks Of joy and sorrow . CALIBAN Where ? Mine eye seeth naught . ARIEL Before him comes a maid  --  a child , all wonder  --  And leads him to this blighted isle . CALIBAN What for , here ? ARIEL To set me free , and all my air-born spirits Whom Setebos holds prisoned in this earth . CALIBAN Free ? What 's that  --  free ? ARIEL What thou canst never be Who never shalt dance with us by yellow sands . SPIRITS OF ARIEL Sing within . " Come unto these yellow sands , &nbsp; &nbsp; And then take hands:Courtsied when you have and kiss 'd &nbsp; &nbsp; The wild waves whist.Foot it featly here and there "  --  CALIBAN Ho , blast their noises ! Stop thy spirits ' squealing . Their piping itcheth me like hornets ' stings . SPIRITS OF ARIEL Sing on , within. p. 6 " And , sweet sprites , the burthen bear "  --  CALIBAN Screaming . Setebos ! Squash ' em ! POWERS OF SETEBOS Sing below with strident roarings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Setebos ! Thou art Setebos ! CALIBAN Exulting grotesquely . Who 'll dance by yellow sands ?  --  Who 's free now , spirit ? Ho , Caliban can squash their music . Free ? Are n't I a god , bitch-born , the son of Setebos Can howl all hell up ? Worship me , thou wings ! Praise my toad-father in his temple ! ARIEL The priests Of Setebos are Lust and Death and War . Not Ariel  --  nor Ariel 's Spirits ever  --  Shall do them honor . One shall come hereafter Whom we now worship , waiting . CALIBAN Roaring . Sycorax ! SYCORAX Reappearing . Swallow thy croakings , bullfrog . Call the priests , And fill this spirit 's nostrils with the reek Of Setebos , his blood-rites . SPIRITS OF ARIEL Cry out piercingly . Ariel ! ARIEL Peace , my brave hearts ! Be dumb  --  but still be dreaming ! CALIBAN Powers of Setebos !  --  Lust , Death , War ,  --  ho , now ! Hither , and do my father worship ! ARIEL Stifling a cry. p. 7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrayed as priests of Setebos . SYCORAX To Caliban . Come , toad-boy : watch with me , within . CALIBAN Going within the cave , as Sycorax disappears . Free , saith ? Will dance by yellow sands ?  --  Now , Spirit , dance ! As Caliban goes within , the powers of Setebos come forth . At the altar beneath Ariel , the three Priests lead them in ceremonial rites of primeval pageantry and dance  --  the sacrificial worship of Setebos . Above them Ariel suffers , with closed eyes . In their rites , Lust pours his libation , and lights the altar fire , which  --  when War has made there his living sacrifice  --  Death extinguishes in darkness . Through the dark , which gradually changes to a glowing dusk , Ariel speaks aloud . ARIEL O Spirits , I have dreamed , but Death has closed My sight in darkness . Spirits , I have begotten Sweet Joy , but Lust hath drowned her in his wine . Yea , I have wove Love wings , but War hath robbed &nbsp; them And riven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Setebos . My Spirits , I your master am unmastered . Speak to me ! Comfort me ! Is there no joy , No love , no dream , that shall survive this dark ? Hath this our isle no king but Caliban ? Are there no yellow sands where we shall dance To greet the master of a timeless dawn ? Or must there break no morning ?  --  Ah , you are dumb Still to my doubtings . Yet the dark grows pale , And , paling , pulses now with rosier shadows ; And now the shadows tremble , and draw back Their trailing glories : hark ! All little birds Wake in the gloaming : look ! What young Aurora Walks in the dusk below , and like a child Turns her quick face to listen ?  --  Ah ! Below , against the light from the sea , has entered the dim Figure he descries. p. 8 THE FIGURE Who calls ? ARIEL Spirits , ' t is she ! O , we have dreamed her true At last  --  Miranda !

MIRANDA Here : His cloak is round us now : he holds us now In his great art , revealing each to each Though he be all invisible . Rentering , Caliban comes forward , sniffing and peering at Miranda . CALIBAN Hath feet And hair : hath bright hair shineth like a fish 's tail ; Hath mouth , and maketh small , sweet noises . ARIEL Crying out . Beast , Go back ! MIRANDA Staring , amazed .

MIRANDA O Ariel , is this sight A true thing , and speaks truly ? ARIEL What you hear And see  --  ' t is my master . MIRANDA ' T is so wonderful I know not how to be sad . CALIBAN In puzzled fascination , staring at Miranda. p. 10 The moon hath a face And smileth on the lily pools , but hath No lily body withal : thy body is All lilies and the smell of lily buds , And thy round face a pool of moonbeams !

Pauses at a glowing thought , then cries with sudden exultance : So shall us twain Caliban all this world ! He crouches , then rolls over at her feet.  --  Laugh , Spring-i ' - the- air ! Lift so thy lily-pad foot and rub his ear Where the fur tickleth , and let thy Caliban Tongue-lick its palm . He lies , dog-like , on his back , and laughs loud . MIRANDA This wonder grows too wild . ARIEL Go , go ! O flee away ! CALIBAN Leaping up. p. 11 Away ?  --  Aye , so ! He approaches Miranda , who recoils , half fearful . Wist where salt water lappeth warm i ' the noon And shore-fish breed i ' the shoals .  --  Wist where the sea-bull Flap-flappeth his fin and walloweth there his cow And snoreth the rainbow from his nostrils . He begins to dance grotesquely about her . Ho , Spring-i ' - the- air ! shalt leap , shalt roll in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race wi ' the gulls ! Shalt laugh , and call  --  Come , Come !

ARIEL Calling shrilly . Prospero ! SPIRITS OF ARIEL Sing within . Prospero ! Hail ! A clap of thunder strikes , rolling , in sudden darkness . Lightnings burst from the idol of Setebos . From the flashing gloom , choruses of contending spirits commingle the roar of their deep bass and high-pitched choirs. p. 13 SPIRITS OF ARIEL Prospero !

PROSPERO The will of Setebos is matched with mine To rule our world . Time shall award the prize  --  Mine own Miranda  --  to his power or mine . His might is awful , but mine art is deep To foil his power and exalt mine own . Ariel , thy spirits shall help me . ARIEL Master , how ? PROSPERO Thou , long time artless , now shalt learn mine art To win my goal  --  Miranda 's freedom . Never Till this immortal Caliban shall rise To lordly reason , can Miranda hold Her maiden gladness undismayed . For that I will release thee from those fangs Of Setebos . ARIEL For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dreaming . PROSPERO So , wilt give thy promise To learn of me , and teach this monster here ? ARIEL O set me free to be thy servant ever . Master , I promise ! PROSPERO Fly ! Run free !  --  Unfang him , Setebos ! Prospero raises his staff . Slowly the tiger-jaws of the Idol open their fangs . Ariel , with a joyous cry , slips into the air , and  --  as he floats fluttering to the earth  --  his unseen choir of Spirits sing with shrilly gladness : SPIRITS OF ARIEL Prospero ! Prospero ! Hail ! ARIEL Dancing on the earth. p. 16 Free ! Free ! MIRANDA Eagerly . O , now his fettered Spirits : Free them too !

Singing as they rush forth , the Spirits dart with Ariel swiftly about the grovelling Caliban and chase him , dodging and whining , down the steps to the ground-circle , mottled with its shadowy continents of the world , and rimmed with its long , yellow wave-lines .

I charge thee , Spirit , Not to torment , but teach him  --  for which task Thou wilt require mine art . So by its power We will transform this cave of Setebos To be a temple to Miranda . Now Let these thy Spirits lead her to her shrine Yonder , where all her maiden Muses wait To make her welcome . Prospero points to where , on the right , appears Miranda 's shrine . From its portals come forth the Nine Muses , bearing lutes and pipes . Prospero , turning to Miranda , rises and gives her into Ariel 's care . Child , go with them now And tarry till I summon . MIRANDA Sir , I will . I thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Setebos . ARIEL Sweet Mistress , follow ! To a melodious luting and piping played by the Muses , Ariel and his Spirits escort Miranda to the centre , where the Muses meet and conduct her into the shrine , while Ariel 's Spirits  --  at a gesture from him  --  dart through the centre of the Cloudy Curtains and disappear . PROSPERO Calling. p. 18 Now hither , bird , and perch ! ARIEL Running to him , on the throne . Beside you , Master ! PROSPERO Pointing to the ground-circle . Seest yonder Yellow Sands ? There sleep the shores , The cloudy capes and continents of time ; There wane and wax eternal tides , that mark The ebb and flow of empires with their foam . There shalt thou see the million-colored skein Whereof I weave mine art . Look well and learn ! For this my art is of no only land Or age , but born of all  --  itself a world Snatched from the womb of History , to survive Its mortal mother in imagination .  --  Dost thou attend me ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth of Caliban 's cell are now visible Lust , Death , and War , who in pantomime indicate to Caliban their conspiracy against Prospero and Ariel . PROSPERO ' T is well , for thou must prove my pupil . Look ! Even now the priests of Setebos conspire With Caliban against us . They will compass My fall , Miranda 's ruin , and thy bondage Unless mine art can foil them . Therefore , now Thou shalt behold the pageant of mine art Pace from antiquity . First , while yon glass Lets flow its yellow sands , behold appear My rites of ancient Egypt , Greece , and Rome , And , while they pass , I will instruct thee how To use them .  --  Pageant , appear ! A deep gong sounds. p. 19 @x As the Roman Interlude closes , the light passes from the ground-circle to the middle stage , where Prospero  --  descending his throne with Ariel  --  moves toward the centre . While they speak together there , Caliban  --  coming from his cave  --  crawls part way up the steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . PROSPERO So , Ariel , I have harvested for thee These orchards of mine art , and let thee taste Their varied fruitages , some that have ripened In climes auspicious , some that are part decayed . Now from three vineyards  --  Egypt , Greece , and &nbsp; &nbsp; Rome  --  I will distill a varicolored wine For Caliban to drink . So , steeped in spirit , Haply he also shall see visions . Hast Thou learned by heart all that I whispered to thee ? ARIEL All , Master . PROSPERO Tell me part . ARIEL You will create Out of this world of art three scenes of vision . PROSPERO And who shall act them  --  say ! ARIEL My Spirits shall ; And I will be their Prologue . PROSPERO For what purpose ? ARIEL To tutor this beast . p. 21 PROSPERO And why ? ARIEL That he may grow To reverence Miranda , and forswear Setebos . PROSPERO So ! and to dispel the Powers Of Setebos , I have transformed his cave To be her temple and my theatre .  --  Look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the background . As he does so , increasing light reveals the rude , irregular contours of the cave of Setebos transformed to the architectural lines of a splendid proscenium , in the oblong of which the Cloudy Curtains shut off the inner stage . The idol of Setebos has vanished . While this transformation is taking place , the Spirit Choirs of Ariel appear above the proscenium , singing . SPIRITS OF ARIEL In the same abode and cellWhere the Toad was wont to dwell , And the Tiger stretched his claw , We have built a shrine of Law:We have chosen the lair of hateTo love , imagine and create . Out of blood and dross , Out of Setebos , We are risen to showThe art of Prospero:Here within his head and heartOur souls are servants of his art . Their appearances vanish above. p. 22 ARIEL Most noble Master ! Show me now behind Those cloudy curtains : How have you transformed The cave within ? PROSPERO Come ; I will show thee how .

Restore thy father 's temple . CALIBAN Yea , but my father had no feet to dance . Curse on their yellow sands ! They sting my eyes Still wi ' their blindings . Blast ' em ! He springs part way up the steps again . LUST Caliban ! Restore the priests of Setebos ! CALIBAN His priests ! Nay , what if the cock sang  --  their chanticleer His Diddle-diddle-dow !

If thou obey him And learn mine art , thou shalt go free like him . If not , thou shalt be spitted on a tooth More sharp than Setebos . What sayest ? CALIBAN Cringing . Lord , Art Cock o ' the world , and Caliban thy worm ; Yea , only beggeth thee crow no more , nor set Thy dancing dogs to bark at him . PROSPERO Tush , fool : Wilt thou obey ?

Ariel retires within through the curtains , which then  --  to the melodic dirge of flutes within  --  draw apart , disclosing the inner stage , which depicts a scene of vivid Egyptian coloring . FIRST INNER SCENE Against a background of deep blue sky , the barge* " The barge she sat in , like a burnish 'd throne , Burn 'd on the water : the poop was beaten gold ; Purple the sails , and so perfumed thatThe winds were love-sick with them .

The charm and splendor of this description applies here only to the beauty of the barge and those it bears : otherwise Cleopatra and her attendants are , in their appearance , distraught and fearful , and the barge shows signs of recent perilous escape from the scene of Antony 's seabattle with Octavius Csar . Being here conceived as a plastic vision in the mind of Prospero , this Inner Scene  --  an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's play  --  has , by dramatic license appropriate to this masque , been laid in a scene suggested by the above description of the barge.of Cleopatra lies moored at an ancient wharf : From the left , along the wharf , enters Mark Antony , attended by Soldiers and Populace in Roman and Egyptian garb. p. 25 ANTONY Hark ! the land bids me tread no more upon ' t ; It is ashamed to bear me !

Canst thou , then , taste my vision , slave ? He descends the throne toward Caliban . CALIBAN Staring about him . O dazzle-blue , gold-shine , hot lotus smell ! Blood-root in bloom , and scarlet water-weed !  --  O silver sight and tinkle-tickling sound !  --  Spurteth my body with joy  --  burst in my brain Enormous moons of wonder !  --  Float , still float , You purpling sails ! Blaze , thou flame-woman ! Speak Sparkles of kissing fire ! PROSPERO Approaching him . Nay , art thou touched Beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord Chanticleer , unswallow from thy gorge The world thou hast devoured ! PROSPERO Pointing toward Ariel , who comes forth again as Prologus through the curtains . Ask of thy tutor ; He hath revealed that world to thy brute ken .  --  Ariel , this lump of earth hath dreams within ' t , That now begin to sprout . Send it more sun And watering . p. 29 ARIEL Sir , your art is rain and sun : I am but air , to carry its wet or warmth Whereso you list . PROSPERO So let it fall on him Till he shall wax to a more worthy plant For Miranda 's temple-garden.  --  Here is my Staff : This wields my power . Here keep it in thy charge Till I return . So , use it as a rod To instruct this bungling cub of Setebos . ARIEL As Prospero goes . I will , sir .  --  Go you far ? PROSPERO No farther than The frontiers of mine art . Farewell a while ! Prospero passes within through the curtains . Half confiding , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . CALIBAN Art , saith ! What 's that  --  his art ? ' ARIEL ' T is that which burns Now in thy blood : the same which conjured hither Bright Egypt and the kiss of Antony . CALIBAN The woman and the kiss ! Nay , saidest now ' T is rain and sun ! ARIEL ' T is so . CALIBAN Where falleth his rain ? Where shineth his sun ? ARIEL Yonder on the Yellow Sands . CALIBAN Nay , show me this art ! Is ' t hidden in thy hand ? Here , let me hold the staff . Caliban reaches for the staff ; Ariel raises it warningly. p. 30 ARIEL Stay ! Touch it not Lest it shall scorch thy fingers and set fire To the building world . The staff of Prospero Is for his servants , not for slaves , to wield . CALIBAN Drawing back from it , in fear . Scorcheth my fingers , ah ?  --  So wield it , thou ! Show me once more the snake-bright queen . ARIEL Nay , Egypt No more ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play master now . Here thou shalt sit And watch the battlements of eternal Troy Where Troilus woos inconstant Cressida . CALIBAN Showest me once more  --  woman ? ARIEL Even so ; For many kinds of woman make mankind . Rising , Ariel points toward the inner stage and speaks chantingly . Now , from out Time 's storied sphere , Homer 's Troy I summon here , On a dawn when Hector seeksBattle with the besieging Greeks:There , while heroes throng the gates , Cressida her lover ' waits , Casting from a height apartTangling hooks for Troilus ' heart .  --  Behold her now , by Prosper 's art ! Ariel raises his staff . SECOND INNER SCENE* During this scene , Caliban  --  watching intently  --  slides from the steps of the throne and crawls slowly forward on his stomach to the centre , where he lies prone , with head lifted  --  his body pointed toward the Inner stage  --  kicking at times his lower legs from the knees in the air . The Cloudy Curtains draw back , revealing the battlements of Troy . Above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning , CRESSIDA appears , with a maiden Attendant . Below , murmuring crowds are looking toward the outer gates . Among them pass the aged Trojan Queen , and the Greek Helen , in her younger beauty . p. 31 CRESSIDA Peering below . Who were those went by ? ATTENDANT Queen Hecuba and Helen . CRESSIDA And whither go they ? ATTENDANT Up to the eastern tower To see the battle  --  Hector , Before the sun uprose , was harnessed light And to the field goes he . Enter behind them Pandarus . CRESSIDA Hector 's a gallant man .  --  Turning to greet him . Good morrow , Uncle Pandarus . PANDARUS Smiling . Good morrow , Cousin Cressid . Trumpets are sounded , off left . Hark ! They are coming from the field . Shall we stand up here and see them as they pass toward Ilium ? CRESSIDA At your pleasure . They move to a better vantage . At a gesture from Cressida the Attendant departs . PANDARUS Here , here 's an excellent place . I 'll tell you them all by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Troilus above the rest . CRESSIDA With a reproving laugh . Speak not so loud . Below , from the left , Trojan warriors , in battle gear , begin to pass by , through the admiring populace who cheer them occasionally . Among them NEAS PASSES p. 32 PANDARUS That 's neas : is not that a brave man ? He 's one of the flowers of Troy , I can tell you . But mark Troilus ; you shall see anon . ANTENOR PASSES CRESSIDA Who 's that ? PANDARUS That 's Antenor : he 's one o ' the soundest judgments in Troy . But when comes Troilus ? I 'll show you Troilus anon . If he sees me , you shall see him nod at me . CRESSIDA Archly . Will he give you the nod ? PANDARUS You shall see . CRESSIDA If he do , the rich shall have more . HECTOR PASSES PANDARUS That 's Hector : that , that , look you , that ; there 's a fellow ! Go thy way , Hector ! There 's a brave man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Swords ! anything , he cares not ; an the devil comes to him , it 's all one . Yonder comes Paris  --  Paris ! PARIS PASSESWho said he came hurt home to-day ? He 's not hurt . Why , this will do Helen 's heart good now , ha ! Would I could see Troilus now ! You shall see Troilus anon . HELENUS PASSES p. 33 CRESSIDA Who 's that ? PANDARUS Searching with his eyes , grows impatiently expectant . That 's Helenus.  --  I marvel where Troilus is.  --  That 's Helenus  --  I think he went not forth to-day .  --  That 's Helenus . CRESSIDA Can Helenus fight , uncle ? PANDARUS Helenus ? no . Yes , he 'll fight indifferent well .  --  I marvel where Troilus is . Hark ! do you hear the people cry " Troilus ? " TROILUS PASSES As he approaches , the populace cheer him . His eyes , however , search about till they rest on the battlement , where Cressida , returning his look , starts back , trembling . Noting both their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hero . ' T is Troilus ! There 's a man , niece . Hem ! Brave Troilus ! CRESSIDA Peace ! For shame , peace ! PANDARUS Mark him : note him . O brave Troilus ! Look well upon him , niece ; look you how his sword is bloodied , and his helm more hacked than Hector 's . O admirable youth ! Go thy way , Troilus , go thy way ! Had I a sister were a grace , or a daughter a goddess , he should take his choice . O admirable man ! Paris ? Paris is dirt to him . While he is speaking , Cressida has taken from her hair a flower , knotted its stem to an arrow , and dropped the arrow beneath the rampart , where Troilus lifts it with a smile and happy gesture , bearing it away with him , right . As Pandarus now turns to her , Cressida looks away left and points to others below. p. 34 CRESSIDA Here comes more . MORE FORCES PASS PANDARUS Asses , fools , dolts ! Chaff and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die i ' the eyes of Troilus . Ne'er look , ne'er look ! the eagles are gone ; crows and daws , crows and daws ! I had rather be such a man as Troilus than Agamemnon and all Greece . Enter , above , Troilus ' Boy , who speaks to Pandarus . THE BOY Sir , my lord Troilus would instantly speak with you . PANDARUS Where ? THE BOY At your own house ; there he unarms him . PANDARUS Good boy , tell him I come . Exit Boy . Fare ye well , good niece . He goes off , above . CRESSIDA Adieu , uncle ! Below , the last of the soldiers and populace have passed off , right , where Cressida gazes after them , speaking aloud to herself : O more in Troilus thousandfold I see Than in the glass of Pandar 's praise may be ; Yet hold I off . Women are angels , wooing . Things won are done ; joy 's soul lies in the doing . Below , from the right , Troilus hastens back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the links in his chain armor on his left side . Pointing to it , he calls up toward the battlement. p. 35 TROILUS Cressida ! CRESSIDA With a glad cry . Troilus ! Unwinding her long wine-red scarf , she ties it to the battlement , whence it flutters down to Troilus . Seizing it , he mounts by its aid toward the rampart , where the face of Cressida peers luringly above him . TROILUS Calling upward as he mounts . Cressida ! Just as he is about to reach Cressida , THE CLOUDY CURTAINS CLOSE . At the centre Caliban now leaps up in loud , excited laughter . Clapping his hands in the air , he strides toward Ariel on the throne . CALIBAN Aha ! Troy , Troy ! Lips of Troyland and Egypt ! Lovers in links of gold ! Ho , wine of woman Bubbling in vats of war !  --  drinketh you all Caliban , Caliban , son of Setebos.  --  Ariel , Learnest me Art ? Lo , now : I am his Artist ! Tell him , Lord Prospero , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ho , ' t is God 's play ! But me ? Am God i ' the mire : can make me Troy And purple Egypt out of the mud i ' my palm ; Giveth me only that  --  his little play stick Pointing to the staff in Ariel 's hand . To stir in the mud withal . ARIEL Not yet !  --  This staff Is wrought to stir the spirits of the air , Not dabble i ' the slime . p. 36 CALIBAN Why so ? From bog-slime bloometh The lotus , and the sea-lark feedeth her young Along the salt flats .  --  With childish wheedling . Prithee  --  the staff ? ARIEL Descending the throne . ' T ' would burn thee . Touch not till thou art free . Yet patience , monster , For thou hast learned to answer well , and growest Rarely in thought and speech . CALIBAN Tickled to laughter . Yea , clever monster Soon groweth monstrous clever . More art , fine Ariel ! Let Caliban speak thy Prologue . ARIEL Hush !  --  Miranda ! From her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two , she pauses astonished . MIRANDA Nay !  --  Is this Ariel ? ARIEL ' T is I  --  Prologus . Will you hear me , Mistress ? MIRANDA As Caliban approaches . Thou !  --  thou , Caliban ! ARIEL My pupil . CALIBAN With confiding assurance . Liketh well thy father 's art , Spring-i ' - the- air. p. 37 MIRANDA God speed thy learning , monster ! I am more fain to help thee in that task Than all else in the world . CALIBAN Astonished and eager . Wouldst help me  --  thou ? MIRANDA How happy , if I could ! CALIBAN Yea , canst thou !  --  Hark : Glancing from his garb to Ariel 's . Let me wear glory , too ! What booteth me To be his Artist , if I wear no cloth To show my glory ? He there talketh no Prologue Without his toga . Tog me , too , in brave Colors ! MIRANDA Well thought on . To one of the Muses . Quick , Euterpe : Fetch Bright vesture forth . ARIEL For Caliban ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lies Most near to them who lack it . Euterpe returns , bringing bright garments , which she and the other Maidens help now to put upon Caliban . So , dear Muses : Lay on ! CALIBAN Delightedly tries to survey himself . Ha , Sycorax , an thou wert here now To look on this thy son ! He parades , with swelling pleasure , before the Muses . Gaze well , good Spirits ! Now , Ariel , thy pupil soon shall teach thee What thing this Art is : yea , teach Prospero A lesson in ' s own lore . p. 38 MIRANDA To Ariel , who is about to protest . Pray , let him tarry This time with us . He is too full of dreams To act us harm . Speak on thy Prologue . CALIBAN Still parading . Prologue ! Aye , good : my Prologue shall come after . ARIEL Mistress , Keep here , this staff for your protection . Accepting the staff from Ariel , Miranda takes seat on the shrine , where the Muses range themselves about her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CALIBAN Moving to the shrine steps , speaks to Ariel . What showest now ? ARIEL At centre , before the curtains . Now , in Time 's emblazoned tome Egypt , Greece , turn page for Rome . CALIBAN Mutters aloud . Rome , ha ! I 'll show you Rome ! ARIEL Rocked by mighty Csar 's fallGlooms the world in battle pall , Where by midnight , worn and spent , Weary Brutus , in his tent , Watches ' mid the Roman host.There the pallid Csar 's ghostRises from his candle-flameAccusing.  --  Who shall bear that blame ? Can Brutus wake a world from shame ? Ariel disappears through the curtains . Miranda raises the staff . THIRD INNER SCENE The Cloudy Curtains part , disclosing the tent of Brutus , by moonlight . Brutus  --  his outer armor laid aside  --  sits on a couch : near him Lucius , a boy , nods drowsily over a stringed instrument . After a brief pause , Brutus  --  gazing at him  --  speaks wistfully : p. 39 BRUTUS Bear with me , good boy : Canst thou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strain or two ? LUCIUS Aye , my lord , a n't please you . BRUTUS It does , my boy : I should not urge thy duty past thy might ; I know young bloods look for a time of rest . LUCIUS I have slept , my lord , already . BRUTUS It was well done ; and thou shalt sleep again ; I will not hold thee long . If I do live I will be good to thee . LUCIUS Tuning his instrument , sings dreamily : Fear no more the frown o ' the great ; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thou art past the tyrant 's stroke.Care no more to clothe and eat ; &nbsp; &nbsp; To thee the seed is as the oak . &nbsp; The sceptre , learning , physic , must &nbsp; All follow this and come to dust . Lucius falls asleep . BRUTUS This is a sleepy tune . O murderous slumber , Lay'st thou thy leaden mace upon my boy That plays thee music ? Gentle knave , good-night ; I will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the leaf turned down Where I left reading ? Here it is , I think . The Ghost of Csar appears . How ill this taper burns !  --  Ha ! Who comes here ? I think it is the weakness of mine eyes That shapes this monstrous apparition . It comes upon me . Art thou anything ? Art thou some god , some angel , or some devil , That makest my blood cold and my hair to stare ? Speak to me what thou art . In the darkness , dark ghostly shapes , hardly visible , appear to urge forward the dead Csar , who alone is luminous. p. 40 THE GHOST Thy evil spirit , Brutus . BRUTUS Why comest thou ? THE GHOST To tell thee thou shalt see me at Philippi . BRUTUS Well ; then I shall see thee again ? THE GHOST Aye , at Philippi . BRUTUS Why , I will see thee at Philippi , then . The Ghost and the dim Shapes disappear . Brutus rises . Now I have taken heart , thou vanishest : Ill spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Calling aloud . Boy , Lucius ! Romans , Romans ! Awake  --  awake ! THE CLOUDY CURTAINS CLOSE Instantly , in the semi-darkness without , Caliban  --  with a great cry  --  springs among the Muses , snatches from Miranda the staff , and rushes with it to the centre of the middle stage , shouting aloud : CALIBAN Awake , Romans , awake ! Low thunders growl , and sharp flashes glimmer about him . MIRANDA Cries out , appalled . The staff ! His staff ! Touch not its power , lest thou lay waste the world ! CALIBAN Grasping the staff , staggers and sways wildly with it , as though being shocked by an invisible force . Rome ! Now do I hold the roof-beam o ' the world . Now am I lord of lightnings : Lo , mine art Shaketh the throne of Prospero . He strides upon the throne , raising the staff . Awake , Imperial Rome ! Return , ye snake-bright women Of Troy and Egypt ! Stain these yellow sands Wine-red with spillings of your wreathed bowls , And let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be crowned by Setebos ! Caligula ! Caligula ! Caligula ! While he cries aloud , the Powers of Setebos come forth from the cell beneath , clad as Roman men , women , and slaves and , joined by the Roman Interlude Pageant on the ground-circle , raise the Emperor on a palanquin upon their shoulders , and bear him up the steps to the middle stage , shouting " Caligula ! " Here a scene of mingled riot and orgy follows : Women dancers with golden bowls , slaves shackled and driven with whips , rabble groups scrambling for bread loaves flung them by heralds , armed soldiery , and gorgeous patrician lords : these swarm in a sordid saturnalia , from the midst of which the masked form of Caligula rises dominant in splendor . At his gesture , slaves tear the Muses from their shrine , and give them over to the revellers . High above all , clutching the staff , his huge limbs rioting grotesque from his silken garments , Caliban dances on the throne of Prospero . Below , bass voices of invisible choirs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thou art Setebos ! " Seized from the throne with the Muses , Miranda  --  at the centre  --  is borne in faint dread to the reaching arms of Caligula , who is about to place upon her his crown , when a sudden pealing of silvery trumpets strikes silence over all . In awe the revellers gaze upward , and turn toward the background , listening . Above them there , from the darkness , appears a colossal CROSS , burning with white fire . Caligula drops his crown . Shadow falls on the colorful pageantry , and all sink slowly to their knees , as the Spirits of Ariel appear again above  --  their luminous wings outspread like seraphim . At either end one blows a slim tapering trumpet . High and clear , then , their choirs chant in Gregorian unison : p. 41 SPIRITS OF ARIELVexilla Regis prdeunt ; Fulget Crucis mystrium , Quo carne carnis CnditorSuspnsus est patbulo . Quo vulneratis nsuperMucrne diro lance , Ut nos lavret crimine , Manavit unda et snguine . O Crux , ave , spes , unica:Hoc Passinis tmpore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Collaudet omnis spiritus:Quos per Crucis mystriumSalvas , rege per scula . During this chant , the dim revellers beneath bow their bodies more low . And now , to faint organ music , the Cloudy Curtains , parting , reveal the INNER STAGE hung like an early Christian shrine in a catacomb  --  with primitive tapestries of dusky blue and gold . Against these in the glow of candles , an image of haloed Saint Agnes holds a white lamb , which silent shepherds are adoring . This group remains motionless as a tableau . Then silently from either side two priests come forth with swinging censers . Passing forward and down the steps to the ground-circle , they are followed in the dim light by the Roman revellers , who rise and pass off through the Interlude gates . Last of all rises Caligula , who pauses hesitant , looking back where Miranda still kneels , now grouped about by her Muses . As he stoops to lift his crown from the earth , two Figures in the INNER SCENE  --  a Shepherd Boy , and a Shepherd wrapt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and come forward in a circle of light , while THE CLOUDY CURTAINS CLOSE behind them , and above the white cross vanishes . Speaking from the place of light to the Emperor 's form in shadow , the Shepherd calls to him : THE SHEPHERD Caligula ! p. 42 THE EMPEROR Who calls ? THE SHEPHERD Reveal thyself  --  What thing thou art . Stepping slowly into the light , the EMPEROR bows himself before the SHEPHERD , holding up his crown which the Shepherd takes and says with a gesture : Lay off thy mask . Rising , the Emperor puts off his mask , revealing himself as the PRIEST OF SETEBOS . Hail , Lust ! LUST To the Shepherd . Hail , Prospero ! PROSPERO Putting off his sheepskin cloak , which the boy takes from him . Return to Setebos . To the Shepherd Boy . Ariel , lead him below . ARIEL So , Master ! Ariel leads Lust away to the cell beneath . MIRANDA Rising , goes to Prospero 's arms . Father ! From the outer dimness , Caliban  --  who , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flat on the throne steps  --  now grovels forward trailing his silken garment by one sleeve and flings the staff of Prospero into the light space. p. 43 CALIBAN No more ! Will never touch it more ! PROSPERO Staring at the staff . A thousand years To build , and build for beauty , yet in one flare Of riot lust , a lubber idiot Confounds time and my toil .  --  Ah , daughter , daughter ! How shall mine art reclaim this lapsing ape From his own bondage ? MIRANDA Sir , my heart is shaken ; Yet the sweet sight of Agnes and her lamb Hath shown new comfort . Stooping , she lifts the staff and holds it toward him . Therefore , even as a Shepherd , Take up thy staff in patience , and urge still onward This poor sloughed sheep . PROSPERO Yea , patience ! Sun , moon , stars , And all that waxes hath its waning-hour ; But patience is the night behind the stars , Steadfast through all eclipse . With his staff , he touches Caliban where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and god-spittle ! Let thine atoms thaw To mud , where Prosper may imprint once more His blurrd seal . CALIBAN Hoarsely , half rising . Mud : yea , methought to be His Artist , and make dream-things of mine own Like Ariel his spirits , yet now  --  am mud . MIRANDA Pitifully . Nay , star-dust ! p. 44 ARIEL Returning . Master , from those far frontiers You visited , have you not brought us back More pageants of your art ? PROSPERO Yes , Ariel : Back from the dim bourns of the Middle Age Of Germany , France , Spain , and Italy . And now , for this slave 's tutelage , I 'll show you Their quaint moralities and mad-cap mirth . Come hither , and watch : Lo , olden Germany ! Pageant of the north , appear . SECOND INTERLUDE* For fuller description of this Interlude , See Appendix , pages 184-194 . Once more , through the community gates of the ground-circle , appear , in contrasted ritual , successive Folk-Groups , that perform now episodic phases of the dramatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each group departs . First comes the Germanic , in part grimly austere , in part navely grotesque . On a portable , three-tiered stage this group enacts both audience and players of a popular morality play : a pantomime scene depicting  --  in heaven , earth , and hell  --  the tragic , romantic HISTORY OF DOCTOR FAUSTUS . This Action is followed by the contrasted splendor of a medival French scene . Here , in presence of the Kings of France and England , on THE FIELD OF THE CLOTH OF GOLD , is performed a colorful tournament on horseback . Last follows a fusion of the Spanish and Italian groups in the Third ction : a light-hearted dramatic Scherzo , full of laughter , knavery , and romantic love , performed  --  in the midst of a festa  --  by the pied actors of the COMMEDIA DELL ' ARTE . During this last Action , Prospero and Ariel above have withdrawn through the Cloudy Curtains , leaving Caliban alone , staring spellbound at the many-hued festival below him. @x Now , when the Italian Interlude is concluded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at centre the lone figure of Caliban , where he squats above his cell . Gazing out over the ground-circle , he calls aloud his yearning thoughts : CALIBAN O Sands  --  Yellow Sands ! Falleth on you his rain , Shineth his sun ! Yea , there his breeding dews Quicken your blind rock-seeds , till wondrous live things Burst ' em with flame-bright petals ; and where his light falls You blossom with stars and flowers : But me  --  me saith , Am mud ! Calleth me a bubble of black ooze Can breed but only mine own belly-kind  --  Bog-fish and moles.  --  Lieth ! Rising with a great gesture . He lieth ! ' T is lies ! Sands !  --  You wild , yellow sands ! I , too , I , too , Am born to dance by your eternal waves And build brave temples there . I , too , shall bring you Shoutings of life-song , like those Spirits .  --  Lo , I come to you  --  I come now ! Running down the steps , he rushes out upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shining earth . Behind him , at the entrance of the cell , Death appears , holding a great gray cloak . He comes forward , speaking in a thin monotone. p. 46 DEATH Caliban ! CALIBAN Raising his head . What calleth me there ? DEATH Death : priest of Setebos . CALIBAN His temple is fallen : will build no more like his . DEATH Thou shalt restore his temple , Caliban . CALIBAN Rising . Nay , will not ! DEATH None can say me Nay . I am The will to not be which denies all wills . Through the Cloudy Curtains  --  slowly  --  Prospero enters , in troubled meditation . CALIBAN And I am Caliban : Pointing toward Prospero. will be his servant . DEATH Caliban , thou shalt fail . Thyself art failure , Setebos ' son . CALIBAN Myself am done with Setebos : Wear now Miranda 's cloth . DEATH Thou shalt wear mine . Behold ! CALIBAN Looking at the gray cloak . What 's that ? DEATH My cloak , where thou shalt hide To snare Miranda unto bondage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dirgeful choir sounds from the cell behind the figure of Death. p. 47 THE DIRGE Gray  --  gray  --  gray : Joy be unholy and hidden ; Wan be the rainbow of wonder , frozen the tide ! Blind  --  blind  --  blind : Passion be pale and forbidden ; Dumb be the lips of the soul to Beauty denied ! PROSPERO Speaks to Ariel , who comes running from behind the Cloudy Curtains . Blithe bird of mine , my heart is boding ill . Hast thou heard ? ARIEL Nay , Master , what ? PROSPERO His dirges . ARIEL Whose ? PROSPERO Setebos ' . Ha , ' t is not his lust I dread , Nay , nor his tiger tooth , nor belly on fire : ' T is when his fever cools : when the gray ash Covers the life-flame , and the boiling senses Skim with thin ice , and the rank bloom wears hoar-frost : Not savage souls , ' t is dead souls that defeat us . Not red , but gray  --  gray . While Prospero and Ariel have spoken together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hypnotized by Death toward the cell . DEATH To Caliban . Follow me . CALIBAN I follow ! DEATH At the cell 's mouth , lifts the gray cloak to put upon Caliban . Wear now my color . p. 48 CALIBAN As Death touches him , springs back . No , no ; thy hand-touch freezeth . Fearfully he leaps up the steps , crying aloud : Prospero ! I will serve thee . DEATH Disappearing within the cell . Thou shalt fail . CALIBAN Bowing before Prospero . Master , raise up thy servant . PROSPERO Raise thyself . CALIBAN Slowly rising . So  --  while thou lookest on me , I can rise . PROSPERO Nay , look once more on what I now create For thee to rise by . ' T is mine art , not me , Reigns as thy master . Master it , and go free . The Three move toward the throne , where they soon group themselves on the steps . CALIBAN What wilt thou show me now ? PROSPERO A mind distraught  --  Grasping at realms invisible  --  like thine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of mine old Gothic meditations , bid Thy spirits blazon now a glimpse of Hamlet . He hands to Ariel his scroll. p. 49 ARIEL Your will , great Master , we revere it .  --  Lo where , to meet his father 's spirit , Pale Hamlet watches now , beforeThe parapets of Elsinore ! Ariel raises the scroll ; then , unrolling it , bends his looks upon it , while the Cloudy Curtains part , revealing the FIFTH INNER SCENE . On a platform at Elsinore , by blazing starlight , three Figures are seen pacing the cold . HAMLET The air bites shrewdly ; it is very cold . HORATIO It is a nipping and an eager air . HAMLET What hour now ? HORATIO I think it lacks of twelve . MARCELLUS No , it is struck . HORATIO Indeed ? I heard it not : then it draws near the season Wherein the spirit held its wont to walk . A flourish of trumpets , and ordnance shot off within . What does this mean , my lord ? HAMLET The King doth wake to-night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swaggering up-start reels ; And , as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down , The kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray out The triumph of his pledge . p. 50 HORATIO Pointing . My lord , it comes ! Enter Ghost . HAMLET Angels and ministers of grace defend us !  --  Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn 'd , Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell , Thou comest in such a questionable shape That I will speak to thee : I 'll call thee Hamlet , King , father , royal Dane : O answer me ! What may this mean , That thou , dead corse , again in complete steel Revisit'st thus the glimpses of the moon , Making night hideous , and we fools of nature So horridly to shake our disposition With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls ? Say , why is this ? Wherefore ? What should we do ? The Ghost beckons Hamlet . HORATIO It beckons you to go away with it , As if it some impartment did desire To you alone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more removed ground : But do not go with it . HORATIO No ; by no means . HAMLET It will not speak ; then I will follow it . HORATIO Do not , my lord . HAMLET Why , what should be the fear ? I do not set my life at a pin 's fee ; And for my soul , what can it do to that , Being a thing immortal as itself ?  --  It waves me forth again : I 'll follow it . p. 51 MARCELLUS You shall not go , my lord . HAMLET Hold off your hands . HORATIO Be ruled ; you shall not go . HAMLET My fate cries out , And makes each petty artery in this body As hardy as the Nemean lion 's nerve . Still am I call 'd .

Death hath beckoned And yet thou didst not follow ? CALIBAN Hither I fled To serve thee , but he said that I should fail ; Yet  --  yet , and thou wilt help , I will not fail ! PROSPERO And what wouldst have of me ? CALIBAN Pointing to Ariel . Thy wonder scroll : Nay , not thy staff again ! Will never more Botch with thy lightnings . Nay , but this littler thing Lend me , and let me bear it against Death To free my father 's spirit from his gray pall . Lettest Ariel : let now thy Caliban Conspire to serve thee . He reaches for the scroll. p. 52 PROSPERO Why , thou wheedlest well , And I must hope in thy self-weening . Yet Beware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him : Gray hath arsenic More keen than scarlet or the corroding blood That sered the flesh of Hercules . CALIBAN Eagerly . Wilt lend me The scroll ? PROSPERO With a gesture to Ariel . Here ! Ariel hands the scroll , which Prospero then gives to Caliban . Use this token of mine art Less blindfold than the last . Caliban bounds away with the scroll . ARIEL Half protesting . Will trust him , Master ? PROSPERO Yea , though he fail me yet again , for only Trust can create its object . CALIBAN Joyfully kissing the scroll and raising it . Now , now , Setebos , Thy son shall wean thy Powers from Death , thy priest ! Descending the steps , Caliban hastens to the mouth of the cell , where  --  as he is about to enter  --  Death reappears and hails him . DEATH Welcome , Caliban ! Death beckons within . Pausing momentarily , Caliban seems about to draw back , but recovering his purpose cries out hoarsely : p. 53 CALIBAN Go on ; I 'll follow thee . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vanished , when Miranda comes from her shrine , followed by the Muses , who are accompanied by a troop of Fauns . The classic hides of these are partly concealed by gay medival garments Florentine and French , and some bear in their hands great vellum books and parchments , which they stack in a pile near the shrine . MIRANDA Calling joyously . Muses , sweet friends to mirth ! Come forth again And fetch your little Fauns , that drowsed so long In mildew 'd vaults of antique vellum , through all The winters of dark ages . Come , sad Clio , Unpucker your frown ! You , pale Melpomene , Blush to a lovelier time . Yond yellow sands , That ran blood-red with orgies of old Rome , Shine golden now with young renascence . The ages Renew their summer .

At her command , Terpsychore and the Fauns  --  to instruments played by the Muses  --  perform a joyous dance before Prospero . As they conclude , he greets them with a smile. p. 54 PROSPERO Thanks , you hearts upleaping ! After long ominous hours , thanks for your festa ! And you , dear child incorrigible for joy , Come now , I will requite you  --  not in gold , But golden fantasy , wrought all one glow Of shadowless shining . MIRANDA Ah , another vision ?

Lifting Prospero 's staff , Ariel makes a gesture toward the Cloudy Curtains , which part , discovering the SIXTH INNER SCENE Here , to an opening fanfare of golden trumpets , takes place a PANTOMIME , all of gold , depicting to the eye , as in a glowing fantasy , the meeting of the Kings and their Retinues : the alighting of the Kings from horseback , their embracement and their clasping of hands . During this enactment of the pantomime , the choirs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OF ARIELGlory and serenity , &nbsp; &nbsp; Splendor of desire , Blend where golden lilies bloom &nbsp; &nbsp; Mid St. George 's fire : &nbsp; &nbsp; Lilies of France !  --  beholdHow they glow on the Field of the Cloth of Gold , And the battle-captains curb their bands &nbsp; &nbsp; Where the kings of earth clasp hands .

At the climax of the meeting of the Kings , THE CLOUDY CURTAINS CLOSE PROSPERO Smiling , to Miranda . This glowing taketh thee . MIRANDA O , my good father !

PROSPERO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning messenger And wake the world with beauty . Now my plans Wait on a vast result , for Caliban Himself hath gone to deal with Setebos His gray priest , Death . p. 56 MIRANDA What , Caliban ! O glad Hope for us all ! Your art begins to triumph , And Ariel 's Spirits to conquer . PROSPERO That still waits : Meanwhile mine art drinks from this renaissance Deep draughts against a dark to-morrow .  --  Hither , You Fauns ! Come , bear my gold-emblazoned scrolls And silver-claspd books before me ! Lifting the scrolls and volumes from their pile by the shrine , the Fauns come forward with them to Prospero , who turns affectionately to Miranda . I Will leave you now , and pore awhile on these For further conjurings . MIRANDA Detaining him . Yet conjure once Again before you go ! PROSPERO What wouldst thou , dear ? MIRANDA Hardly I know : but something high , serene , And passionately fair : some vision 'd glimpse Of fadeless youth , and lovers rich through love .

Accompanied by the bright-clothed Fauns , bearing the great books and scrolls in quaint procession , Prospero departs through the throne-entrance . Meantime , the Muses and Miranda gather at the shrine , where Ariel approaches Miranda. p. 57 ARIEL Mistress  --  MIRANDA Hark , Muses ! Ariel , speak on ! ARIEL Ear and eye , now , list and lo : Mirth of mad Mercutio , Juliet 's sigh for Romeo ; Dim Lorenzo 's murmur 'd " Ah ! " For moon-dreaming Jessica ; Dance of flower-soul 'd Perdita Wafted to her Florizel Like a wave o ' the sea : List well ; Lo , their night renews its spell ! At Ariel 's last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the SEVENTH INNER SCENE In the glow and gloom of Italian night , as high clouds intermittently obscure the moon , a palace garden lies in deep shadow . Emerging only partly into view , where soft light-floodings fall on moss-stained statue , marble bench , and balcony , there is revealed at first on the left nothing but a glimpse of garden wall , before which flash in the dimness two pied figures Benvolio and Mercutio . Calling shrilly , their young voices rain showers of fluting laughter . BENVOLIO Romeo ! My cousin Romeo ! He ran this way , and leap 'd this orchard wall : Call , good Mercutio . MERCUTIO Nay , I 'll conjure , too : Romeo ! humors ! madman ! passion ! lover !  --  I conjure thee by thy true love 's bright eyes , By her high forehead and her scarlet lip , By her fine foot , straight leg , and quivering thigh And the demesnes that there adjacent lie , That in thy likeness thou appear to us !  --  He heareth not , he stirreth not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hath hid himself among these trees , To be consorted with the humorous night : Blind is his love and best befits the dark . MERCUTIO If love be blind , love can not hit the mark Romeo , good-night : I 'll to my truckle-bed ; This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep : Come , shall we go ? They disappear , swallowed up in black shadow . And now the shadow , shifting , leaves bare in mellow moonshine a glimpse of the garden and the balcony , where Juliet , bending forward , calls mysteriously into the dark below : JULIET Hist ! Romeo ! hist ! O for a falconer 's voice , To lure this tassel-gentle back again ! Bondage is hoarse , and may not speak aloud ; Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies , And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine With repetition of my Romeo 's name . ROMEO Emerging , below , from the shadow . It is my soul that calls upon my name : How silver-sweet sound lovers ' tongues by night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ROMEO My dear ? JULIET At what o'clock to-morrow Shall I send to thee ? ROMEO At the hour of nine . p. 59 JULIET I will not fail : ' t is twenty years till then . I have forgot why I did call thee back . ROMEO Let me stand here till thou remember it . JULIET I shall forget , to have thee still stand there , Remembering how I love thy company . ROMEO And I 'll still stay , to have thee still forget , Forgetting any other home but this . JULIET ' T is almost morning ; I would have thee gone : And yet no further than a wanton 's bird , Who lets it hop a little from her hand. Good-night , good-night ! Parting is such sweet sorrow That I shall say good-night till it be morrow ! Once more deep shadow engulfs the scene ; and now , out of the dark , harmonious music sounds in strains of passionate wistfulness . So , as the music sounds , on the right , beams of the moon reveal a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LORENZO How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank ! Here will we sit and let the sounds of music Creep in our ears : Soft stillness and the night Become the touches of sweet harmony . Sit , Jessica . Look how the floor of heaven Is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold : There 's not the smallest orb which thou behold'st But in his motion like an angel sings , Still quiring to the young-eyed cherubims , Such harmony is in immortal souls ; But whilst this muddy vesture of decay Doth grossly close it in , we can not hear it . Swift shadow sweeps over them in darkness . Waning from its visionary theme to a hint of the " muddy vesture of decay , " the music flows onward then into a dance melody ; moonlight touches the garden again on the left with its liquid glow , wherein  --  whirled into light from a group of shadowy dancers outside  --  Florizel and Perdita are disclosed. p. 60 FLORIZEL As Perdita withdraws shyly her hand from his , speaks to her ardently . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak , sweet , I 'd have you do it ever . . When you do dance , I wish you A wave o ' the sea , that you might ever do Nothing but that ; move still , still so , And own no other function : each your doing So singular in each particular , Crowns what you are doing in the present deed , That all your acts are queens PERDITA O Doricles , Your praises are too large : but that your youth , And the true blood which peepeth fairly through ' t , Do plainly give you an unstained shepherd , With wisdom I might fear , my Doricles , You woo 'd me the false way . FLORIZEL I think you have As little skill to fear as I have purpose To put you to ' t . But come ; our dance , I pray : Your hand , my Perdita ! PERDITA Giving her hand confidingly . My Florizel ! Together they dance away into the dark and the luring music , as THE CLOUDY CURTAINS CLOSE Still , after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more faint , changing the idyllic strains of the dance rhythm to a minor sadness , which gradually takes form as a drear , monotonous processional . Through the faint music , Miranda speaks to Ariel. p. 61 MIRANDA Too brief ! too brief , sweet bird ! O Ariel , be Time 's nightingale , and charm these lovers back To yearn immortal youth . Methinks already Their absence leaves us age 'd : Dost thou not feel A waning of high powers ? Doth not a pallor Creep on the glowing world ? ARIEL Yea , so I have felt After the equinox  --  November coming on . MIRANDA Starting , as she gazes at one of the Muses . Euterpe dear ! What lock of gray is this In thy bright hair ?  --  Quick , Ariel : fetch my father , For sudden my heart aches , and I wish him near . ARIEL Straight I will bring him , and my Spirits , too . Be merry , mistress : they shall soon restore us . Ariel hastens off , left . As he does so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right into the shrine . MIRANDA Nay , darling Muses ! do not leave me , too . What , must you all go hence ? Still I must tarry To greet my father . Friends , good-bye ! They depart . Ah me ! What voices make their dirge within my heart ? While she has spoken , the mouth of Caliban 's cell , emitting a ghastly glow , fills with dim Shapes , which pour outward , and swarm slowly upward over the steps , covering the stage with a moving , huddled grayness , out of which two cloaked Figures rise distinct in the dusk . As they come forth and hover nearer to Miranda , a cold dirge issues with them from below. p. 62 THE DIRGE As before . Gray  --  gray  --  gray : Joy be unholy and hidden ; Wan be the rainbow of wonder , frozen the tide ! Blind  --  blind  --  blind : Passion be pale and forbidden ; Dumb be the lips of the soul to Beauty denied ! Slowly the gray hosts surround Miranda , who stares at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dusk , growing lighter , reveals their long Puritan cloaks and peaked hats , and the two muffled Ones in Gray towering before her . Then faintly she speaks to them : MIRANDA What are you ? Why are you come ? Ah , you  --  ' t is you : Priest of Setebos !  --  Caliban ! She sways and falls . CALIBAN Ha , she swooneth.  --  O Death , unfasten thy spell ! DEATH Nay , thou hast failed . Lifting the scroll of Prospero , which he has taken from Caliban , Death makes a gesture to his followers . Bear her to Setebos ! Then , laying his hand upon Caliban , he turns with him backward , as a group of the gray-cloaked Shapes raise the limp form of Miranda to a cloth-draped bier , and thus bear her downward toward the cell 's mouth . In dim processional , as they go , they raise again their dirge : p. 63 THE DIRGE Gray  --  gray  --  gray : Love , be sin-born of Misgiving ! Life , be a garment of dullness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Death , Death is lord of the living : Not in the clay but the heart of man lies the tomb . Disappearing in the cell below , their chant dies away . Above them , from the left , Ariel returns , alone . Searching in the dusk , half fearfully , he calls : ARIEL Miranda  --  mistress : He hath vanished . Nowhere Can I find trace of him . Yea , and my Spirits They , too  --  they , too , are gone , lost in the grayness : All have deserted us ! Miranda  --  mistress ! Where art thou ? Gone , thyself ?  --  and I alone ! O gray , that hast engulfed a world of beauty , Where shall I find them ever more  --  my master , My star-bright mistress ? Hear me , Yellow Sands ! If you have beheld them , answer now my prayer ! Outstretching his arms toward the Sands . Prospero ! Prospero !  --  Master ! From far across the Sands bursts a mellow radiance , and the rich voice of Prospero calling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bird ! Springing into light upon the farthest wave-lines of the Yellow Sands , Prospero comes returning , surrounded by the Spirits of Ariel , clad all in green and bearing in their midst a garlanded May-pole . Marching joyously across the circle toward Ariel , all in radiant glow , they come shouting a choral song : THE SPIRITS OF ARIEL " Sumer is icumen in , &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lhude sing cuccu ! Groweth sed , and bloweth med , &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And springth the wude nu .  --  Sing cuccu ! " Awe bleteth after lomb &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lhouth after calve cu ! Bulluc sterteth , bucke verteth , &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Murie sing cuccu ! " Cuccu , cuccu , well singes the , cuccu : &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ne swike the naver nu ; Sing cuccu , nu , sing cuccu , &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sing cuccu , sing cuccu , nu ! " Leaping up the steps , they plant the May-pole at the centre , where Ariel greets them. p. 64 ARIEL Dear Master ! O blithe hearts : Have welcome home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thy mistress ? ARIEL Startled . Alas ! You know not ? PROSPERO Reassuringly . Nay , I know . But cheerly , My birdlings ! Now that ye are flocked once more Round this enchanted tree , I 'll conjure you Out of mine art such joyous rites , that they Shall draw your Mistress even from the tomb To join our revels . Come now , gather round And watch my antic rites of Merry England ! THIRD INTERLUDESee Appendix , pages 196-204 , for more detailed description . Now through the Interlude gates , and from all sides , a jocund festival pours into the illumined space of the ground-circle : the folk festival of Elizabethan England . Simultaneously , in different parts , as in a merry rural fair , various popular arts and pastimes begin , and continue together : Morris dancers and pipers , balladists and play-actors , folk dancers , fiddlers , clowns , and Punch-and-Judy performers romp , rant , parade , and jingle amongst flower-girls and gay-garbed jesters spangling by the bright venders ' booths . Central , at a point of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Noah 's wife harangues the heavens from the old play . So they pursue their merriment , till the low rumble and lowering of a thunder-cloud disperses them with its passing shadow. @x At the conclusion now of the English Interlude , out of the shadow a roseate glow suffuses the cell of Caliban , from which the green-clad Spirits of Ariel come running forth , bringing in their midst Miranda . Leading her in daisy chains , they mount with her the steps toward Prospero , singing in glad chorus : THE SPIRITS OF ARIEL " Spring , the sweet Spring , is the year 's pleasant king ; Then blooms each thing , then maids dance in a ring , Cold doth not sting , the pretty birds do sing , &nbsp; &nbsp; Cuckoo , jug-jug , pu-we , to-witta-woo ! " The palm and may make country houses gay , Lambs frisk and play , the shepherds pipe all day , And we hear aye birds tune this merry lay : &nbsp; &nbsp; Cuckoo , jug-jug , pu-we , to-witta-woo ! " The fields breathe sweet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old wives a-sunning sit , In every street these tunes our ears do greet : &nbsp; &nbsp; Cuckoo , jug-jug , pu-we , to-witta-woo ! &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Spring ! the sweet Spring ! " PROSPERO Greeting her . Welcome , most dear ! p. 66 MIRANDA Once more you bring me home , And the gray world wears green ! CALIBAN Calling , beneath . Ho , Spring-i ' - the- air ! MIRANDA Hark ! From his cell , bare-headed , with gray cloak unbound and flapping behind , Caliban bursts forth and hastens toward them . CALIBAN Spring-i ' - the- air ! Ah , leave me not alone ! Take me forth with thee , too ! Not Death can hold me When thou goest forth from him . MIRANDA It was thyself That led'st me unto him . CALIBAN With thee  --  with thee Would I lie even with Death . But when thou leavest , Thy life-song prickleth his sod , and maketh my sap To leap , and lick the sun again . Kneeling before her . O , whither Thou goest , let Caliban go , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Darkly . Keep from her , slave ! Touch not her hem . Her Muses garbed thee once Gay in her colors . Thou soiled'st them with shame . Next time thou worest drab , and lured'st thy Mistress Deathward in gray . Now  --  now thou darest crave Once more to wear her cloth ? CALIBAN Yea , do I ! See : This cloak  --  so I forswear it ! He puts off the gray cloak , tears it , and tramples upon it ; then turns to Miranda . Give me now Thy green to wear ! p. 67 PROSPERO Insolence infinite ! Ariel , my staff ! MIRANDA Stay !  --  What to do ? PROSPERO About to raise the staff . To teach This unwhipt hound  --  to howl . CALIBAN Starting back . Great Master ! MIRANDA Grace , Dear Father ! Patience needs no quick compulsion . Thine art is wondrous patient , and this poor Slow climber needs thine art . PROSPERO Why , once again Thou art my wiser self . To Caliban . Go , lick her hand , And feed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand weeps , with great sobs . Spring  --  Spring-i ' - the- air , thy dew Dabbleth my face . O wonder , what art thou That fillest so mine eyes with rain-shine ? MIRANDA April , Not I , can conjure spring i ' the air , and April Plies rarest art in England .  --  Ariel , Fetch us , from out my father 's dreamery , Nature 's spring-charm and echo of English song ! To the Spirits of Ariel . Our greenwood cloth ! Come , busk him , merry men all : Aye , both of us ! p. 68 CALIBAN Rapturously . This time I will not fail thee . MIRANDA To Prospero , indicating Caliban . Have faith in this fellow-creature , and let these spirits Clothe him anew . PROSPERO As you like it , dear , be it so ! The Spirits clothe Caliban and Miranda in green , while from within the Cloudy Curtains an unseen chorus sings : THE CHORUS " Under the greenwood treeWho loves to lie with me , And tune his merry noteUnto the sweet bird 's throat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he seeNo enemyBut winter and rough weather . " ARIEL Spirits within , ho ! The Spirits run through the curtains , at centre , and disappear within . Prosper 's hood Broods now a dream of Arden wood , Where young Orlando , daring fight For succor of old Adam 's plight , Defies the greenwood company  --  But meets there with no enemy . CALIBAN By the throne with Miranda and Prospero , murmurs aloud : No enemy ! As Ariel raises his staff , the Cloudy Curtains part , disclosing THE EIGHTH INNER SCENE A place of dappled shine and shadow in the forest . No boughs or trees are visible , but only a luminous glade of color , where falling sunlight filters a swaying glow and gloom from high , wind-stirred branches above . On the edges of the scene , the semi-obscurity half conceals forms of the forest company . Jacques , the Duke , etc. who , seated about their noon-time meal , sing their chorus : THE CHORUSWho doth ambition shunAnd loves to live i ' the sun , Seeking the food he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come hither , come hither:Here shall he seeNo enemyBut winter and rough weather . Enter Orlando , with his sword drawn. p. 69 ORLANDO Fiercely . Forbear , and eat no more ! JACQUES Why , I have eat none yet . ORLANDO Nor shalt not , till necessity be served . THE DUKE What would you have ? Your gentleness shall force More than your force move us to gentleness . ORLANDO I almost die for food ; and let me have it . THE DUKE Sit down and feed , and welcome to our table . ORLANDO Speak you so gently ? Pardon me , I pray you : I thought that all things had been savage here ; And therefore put I on the countenance Of stern commandment . But whate'er you are That in this desert inaccessible Under the shade of melancholy boughs Lose and neglect the creeping hours of time ; If ever you have looked on better days , If ever been where bells have knoll 'd to church , If ever sat at any good man 's feast , If ever from your eyelids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pity and be pitied , Let gentleness my strong enforcement be : In the which hope I blush , and hide my sword . THE DUKE True is it that we have seen better days , And have with holy bell been knoll 'd to church , And sat at good men 's feasts , and wiped our eyes Of drops that sacred pity hath engender 'd : And therefore sit you down in gentleness And take upon command what help we have That to your wanting may be minister'd. p. 70 ORLANDO Then but forbear your food a little while , Whiles , like a doe , I go to find my fawn And give it food . There is an old poor man , Who after me hath many a weary step Limp 'd in pure love : till he be first suffic 'd I will not touch a bit .

ADAM So had you need : I scarce can speak to thank you for myself . THE DUKE Welcome : fall to ! Give us some music ; sing ! Once more , as the chorus resumes the song " Under the Greenwood Tree , " THE CLOUDY CURTAINS CLOSE The music dies away within . With a strange , dawning reverence , Caliban turns to Miranda and speaks : p. 71 CALIBAN " I scarce can speak to thank you for myself . "  --  Like him there you have furnish 'd me food of pity And a new world with no enemy ! MIRANDA You have none , Save the blind storms of your own nature . CALIBAN Those Tempests are still now . PROSPERO Approaching . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good : now the time is ripe Methinks to rest awhile , for I am happily Weary , and will take rest from thought .  --  Miranda , Wilt come within ? Unhood me for brief slumber , And smooth my couch ? MIRANDA Rising . Right gladly . PROSPERO To Ariel . And thou , too , One moment : I 've more for this tutelage . Prospero passes off , right , by the throne exit , accompanied by Ariel . Miranda , about to follow , pauses at Caliban 's entreating voice . CALIBAN Stay ! What your pity hath made me cries to you  --  Leave me not ! Let me be yours ! MIRANDA Wonderingly . How mean you  --  mine ? CALIBAN Your Caliban , your creature , your bond slave To fetch and bear for you . p. 72 MIRANDA I want no bonds ' Twixt me and any friend . Nay , we are friends And free to serve each other . CALIBAN Yet I yearn For more : I know not what . MIRANDA What more could be More happy ? CALIBAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where now I stand And pray  --  with Prosper 's tongue .

' T is simple , then : I love you , Caliban . CALIBAN In a splendor of amazement . Lovest me  --  thou ? thou !  --  Wilt be mine ? MIRANDA Nay , truly You know not how . Love knows not mine and thine , But only ours ; and all the world is ours To serve Love in . I am not thine , good friend . She goes within . CALIBAN Stay yet !  --  She loveth me ! Yet Love , she saith , Love knows not mine and thine . A VOICE FROM BENEATH Calls deeply . She shall be thine , Caliban ! p. 73 CALIBAN Starting . Mine ! Who saith that word ? THE VOICE She shall Be thine ! CALIBAN How mine ?  --  Say ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the Cloudy Curtains . Shall fight ? Nay , there  --  the youth put by his sword , For the other said : " Your gentleness shall force More than your force move us to gentleness . " THE VOICE Yet thou shalt fight ! CALIBAN Springing forward above his cell . What art thou ? From the mouth of the cell a flame-colored Figure strides forth and replies : THE FIGURE War : thy father 's Priest .  --  Caliban , remember Setebos ! CALIBAN Ha , Setebos ! Com'st thou once more with priestcraft To lure me back to him ?  --  Begone ! WAR Yet not Without me shalt thou win Miranda . CALIBAN Fiercely . Go ! WAR Returning within the cell , disappears as his voice dies away . Remember War ! Miranda shall be thine ! p. 74 CALIBAN Hoarsely . Miranda  --  mine ! ARIEL Comes running from the throne entrance . Ho , pupil , now be merry ! Great Prosper sleeps , and from his slumber sends thee A dream of fairy laughter . CALIBAN Darkly , amazed . Laughter ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merry wives , to douse the lustful fire Of old John Falstaff , lured to Windsor Forest .  --  Our Master deems thou hast learned art enough To laugh at apings of it . CALIBAN Still amazed , but curious . Laugh ? ARIEL Aye , list ! Caliban stands on one side , with arms folded and listens . To Windsor 's magic oak now turn:There  --  his fatty bulk in guiseOf the hornd hunter Herne  --  Big Sir John in ambush liesWhere the counterfeited faysTroop along the forest ways:How his lust will cease to burnFor the Merry Wives  --  now gazeYonder by the oak , and learn ! Ariel raises his staff . Parting , the Cloudy Curtains disclose THE NINTH INNER SCENE The gigantic trunk of an oak rises in moonlight , surrounded by the glimmering purple of the obscure forest . Trooping from the left , enter the disguised Fairies , following their leader Sir Hugh Evans. p. 75 SIR HUGH EVANS Trib , trib , fairies ; come ; and remember your parts : be pold , I pray you ; follow me into the pit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do as I pid you : Come , come ; trib , trib . They conceal themselves . A distant chiming sounds as Falstaff enters , disguised as Herne , wearing a stag 's head with great horns . FALSTAFF The Windsor bell hath struck twelve ; the minute draws on . Now , the hot-blooded gods assist me ! Remember , Jove , thou wast a bull for thy Europa ; love set on thy horns . O powerful love ! That , in some respects , makes a beast a man , in some other a man a beast . CALIBAN Listening intently near the edge of the scene . A man a beast ! FALSTAFF Think on ' t , Jove : Where gods have hot backs , what shall poor men do ? For me , I am here a Windsor stag ; and the fattest , I think , i ' the forest . Send me a cool rut-time , Jove ! Who comes here ? My doe ? Enter Mistress Ford and Mistress Page . MRS . FORD Sir John ! Art thou there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the black scut ! Let the sky rain potatoes , let it thunder to the tune of green sleeves ; I will shelter me here . p. 76 MRS . FORD Mistress Page is come with me , sweetheart .

FORD Heaven forgive our sins ! FALSTAFF What should this be ? MRS . PAGE AND MRS . FORD Away ! Away ! They run off . FALSTAFF I think the devil will not have me damned , lest the oil that 's in me should set hell on fire ; he would never else cross me thus . Enter Sir Hugh Evans , disguised as before ; Pistol , as Hobgoblin ; Mistress Quickly , Anne Page , and others as Fairies , with tapers . MRS .

FALSTAFF Rising and pulling off his buck 's head , cries out : Oh ! Oh ! Oh !

THE VOICE OF WAR Calls deeply from below . Hail , Caliban ! CALIBAN Pausing , releases Ariel , and listens . Callest me , War ? THE VOICE Miranda shall be thine ! CALIBAN Mine !  --  Yea , now I am mocked to know myself What rutting stag I am ! And her , the doe I mate , my horns shall battle for , and be Mine own  --  mine , mine ! Miranda ! MIRANDA Coming from within , right , raises her hand in gentle warning . Hush thy tone ; My father slumbers yet . Showing Prospero 's hood , which she carries .

So you may learn , good friend , how noblest natures Are moved to tiger passions  --  by a painting Called Honor , dearer than their brothers ' lives . CALIBAN Why will he show me this ? MIRANDA Perchance that you , Born of a tiger 's loins , seeing that picture , May recognize an image of yourself And so recoil to reason and to love . CALIBAN So , mocketh me once more ? MIRANDA Nay , never that . But let us look thereon , and learn together . CALIBAN Starts toward her , but curbs himself , trembling . Together ! MIRANDA To Ariel . Hold his magic hood and conjure .

Standing above on a parapet , the King is exhorting them with vehement ardor. p. 81 KING HENRY Once more unto the breach , dear friends , once more , Or close the wall up with the English dead ! In peace there 's nothing so becomes a man As modest stillness and humility : But when the blast of war blows in our ears , Then imitate the action of the tiger ; Stiffen the sinews , summon up the blood , Disguise fair nature with hard-favor 'd rage ; Then lend the eye a terrible aspect . Hold hard the breath and bend up every spirit To his full height . On , on , you noble English , Whose blood is fet from fathers of War-proof ! Be copy now to men of grosser blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , good yeomen , Whose limbs were made in England , show us here The mettle of your pasture ; let us swear That you are worth your breeding , which I doubt not. I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips , Straining upon the start . The game 's afoot . Follow your spirit , and upon this charge Cry , " God for Harry , England , and Saint George ! " THE SOLDIERS With a great shout . Ho , God for Harry , England , and Saint George ! As they leap forward , to the blare of trumpets , and begin to scale the ladders , THE CLOUDY CURTAINS CLOSE Instantly Caliban , seizing from the staff the hood of Prospero , shakes it aloft and shouts : CALIBAN Ho , God for Caliban and Setebos ! War , War for Prosper 's throne ! Miranda 's shrine ! A booming detonation resounds , and a roar of voices from below. p. 82 THE VOICES Caliban , Caliban , hail ! From the throne-entrance Prospero  --  unhooded  --  hastens in , surrounded by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swiftly the throne and joined by Ariel and Miranda , Prospero calls to Caliban , who  --  wearing his hood and lifting his staff  --  strides toward him . PROSPERO His unhooded features revealing their likeness to Shakespeare 's . Who wakes my sleep With these usurping thunders ? CALIBAN War and I ! Now Setebos returns , and thou art fallen ! A second detonation booms . Red glare bursts from Caliban 's cell , and War rushes forth with the Powers of Setebos , clad in his flaring habiliments , followed by the groups of Lust and Death . Bearing lighted torches , amid the roaring of Setebos choruses , flashing fireworks and bombs , they swarm upon the half-obscure stage . Led by War , the flame-colored hordes clash with the Spirits of Ariel , overcome them , and take captive Miranda , Prospero , and Ariel . As War holds Miranda in his power , Prospero confronts Caliban who  --  wearing his hood and raising his staff  --  exults before him : Hail , Prospero ! Who now is master-artist ! Who wieldeth now the world ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me thou robb'st my hood and staff Which wield my power ; yet not mine art they wield Without my will : my will thou canst not rob Nor ravish . CALIBAN With eyes gleaming . But Miranda ! PROSPERO Nay , nor her : For she is charmed against thy body 's rape By chastity of soul . Thy will and War May break , but can not build the world : And One , Who bore us all within her womb , still lives To stanch our wounds with her immortal healing . CALIBAN Where ? PROSPERO Pointing. @x Where Prospero points , the light passes from the pageant of War to the centre of the Yellow Sands . There , in mellow splendor , a serene female Figure , rising majestic from the altar , calls to the thronging shadows . THE SPIRIT OF TIMEChildren of men , my passionate children , hark ! To-day and Yesterday I am To-morrow : &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Out of my primal dark &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You dawn  --  my joy , my sorrow . Lovers of life , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lightnings riven : &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yea , on my flux and flow , &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Like sea-birds tempest-driven . Yet from my founts of life , fecund , divine , Still dauntless lovers dare my dark tribunal , &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Building a common shrine &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To hold their love communal . So out of War up looms unconquered Art : Blind forces rage , but masters rise to mould them . Soldiers and kings depart ; Time 's artists  --  still behold them ! As the Spirit of Time ceases to speak , the light passes to the entrances of the Greek ground-circle , where now  --  from either side  --  enters a Pageant of the great Theatres of the world  --  from the ancient Theatre of Dionysus to the Comedie Francaise  --  in symbolic groups , with their distinctive banners and insignia . The names of these are blazoned on their group standards , and the groups themselves like those that follow are announced from either end of the high balcony above the inner stage by two spirit Trumpeters , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other beneath a sickle moon . p. 85 While these , below , have ranged themselves on the ground-circle and steps above  --  the groups of War , Lust , and Death have dwindled away in the background darkness  --  leaving only Prospero , Miranda , and Ariel , grouped in light at the centre . Then on either wing of the stage , at right and left , appears luminous a colossal mask  --  the one of Tragedy , the other of Comedy . Through the mouths of these , now come forth , in national pageant groups , * For details of these Epilogue groups , see Appendix , pages 205-216. the creators of the art of the theatre from antiquity to the verge of the living present : the world-famed actors , dramatists , producers , musicians , directors , and inventors of its art . First come the great Actors , in the guise of their greatest rles  --  from Thespis and Roscius of old to Irving , Salvini , Coquelin , Booth , of modern times , the comic actors tumbling forth from the Mask of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are followed by national groups of the great Dramatists from schylus to Ibsen , who pass in review before Prospero . Among these , with the Elizabethan Dramatists , grouped with Marlowe , Green , Jonson , Beaumont , and Fletcher , and others , appears the modest figure of Shakespeare , at first unemphasized . For one moment , however , as Shakespeare himself approaches Prospero , he pauses , Prospero rises , and the two figures  --  strangely counterparts to their beholders  --  look in each other 's eyes : a moment only . For Prospero , slipping off his cloak , lays it on the shoulders of Shakespeare , who sits in Prospero 's place , while Prospero moves silently off with the group of Dramatists. p. 86 Finally , when these pageants of Time have passed , and the stately Spirit of Time vanished in dark on the Yellow Sands , the only light remains on the figure of Shakespeare  --  and the two with him : Ariel tiptoe behind him , peering over his shoulder ; Miranda beside him , leaning forward , with lips parted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dimness , comes forth Caliban . Groping , dazed , he reaches his arms toward the dark circle , where the stately Spirit has vanished . In a voice hoarse with feeling , he speaks aloud . CALIBAN Lady of the Yellow Sands ! O Life ! O Time ! Thy tempest blindeth me : Thy beauty baffleth.  --  A little have I crawled , a little only Out of mine ancient cave . All that I build I botch ; all that I do destroyeth my dream . Yet  --  yet I yearn to build , to be thine Artist And stablish this thine Earth among the stars  --  Beautiful ! Turning to the light , where the Three are grouped.  --  O bright Beings , help me still ! More visions  --  visions , Master ! With gesture of longing , he crouches at Shakespeare 's feet , gazing up in his face , which looks on him with tenderness . With Caliban , Miranda too appeals to the Cloaked Figure . MIRANDA Wistfully.  --  Master ? To her raised eyes , he returns a pensive smile. p. 87 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ended . These our actors , As I foretold you , were all spirits and Are melted into air , into thin air : And , like the baseless fabric of this vision , The cloud-capp 'd towers , the gorgeous palaces , The solemn temples , the great globe itself , Yea , all which it inherit , shall dissolve , And , like this unsubstantial pageant faded , Leave not a rack behind . We are such stuff As dreams are made on , and our little life Is rounded with a sleep . " Then , while the light focusses and fades in darkness on the pensive form of Shakespeare , the choirs of Ariel 's Spirits repeat , unseen , in song : THE SPIRITS OF ARIEL
