txt // which combine to form what is called the literary instinct . A very similar phenomenon is found in music : just as a living word calls up not one idea but a series of related ideas , so a living note calls up not one but a series of related sounds ; the presence of these secondary sounds can not be discovered by introspection ; we are only made aware of them by a vague sense of dissonance which results when they form discordant combinations one with another , marring the cited of chords which are in other respects harmonious . In like manner there are overtones of speech , t he presence of which we are unaware of and could not discover by deliberate analysis of the content of consciousness , yet which make themselves felt so soon as we attempt to combine words in such a way as to give pleasure to ourselves and others . Hence the joy of " le mot juste , " which strikes some harmonious chord in the lower depths of consciousness ; hence that mild annoyance will ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writers who are content to thump out their meaning , neglecting the finesse of harmony and orchestration . The matter ? ill be - made clearer by examining a type of language in which the overtones of speech are not only negligible , but proper to be neglected : we mean the language of science . For // in science a word means one thing and one thing only . When a writer on medicine states that " the heart is situated immediately above the stomach , " he does not mean by the word " heart " " the tender emotions , " as when we speak of " a man without heart , " nor does he mean " that part of anything which is farthest from the circumference , " as when we speak of " the heart of London , " but he means simply a certain organ on the left side of the thorax . But when Swinburne writes " I hid my heart in a nest of roses , " he means all that the word " heart " is capable of meaning . In short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art is inclusive . The words preferred of science are those which connote least , those preferred of art are those which connote most . This is one of the reasons why science has always shown such a marked predilection for the use of Latin and Greek words in its nomenclature ; for the words of a dead language can be used as the words of no living language can be used , simply as signs of one thing without prior or posterior signification , and therefore without capacity to excite attraction or repulsion , emotions foreign to the spirit of scientific research . These same words , so useful to science , are utterly repugnant to art . What poet , for example , could // incorporate such words as " liypermsthesia , " " polygamy , " " chloride of sodium " into the texture of his verse ? Even Browning 's omnivorous Muse could hardly digest them ; yet there is nothing unpoetical in the ideas which they convey ; take , for example , the last-named clement : we have only to call it " salt " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerations we can see in what consists the difficulty of translating a work of literary art . Benedetto Croce , the Italian philosopher , in his remarkable treatise on aesthetics , boldly asserts that translation is impossible , for , as he holds , the act of intuition and the act of expression are but two aspects of a single fact ; hence the intuition can not possibly be separated from the form of words in which it is expressed . This view seems to be corroborated by the fact so often observed , that the most beautiful and telling phrases of one language seem to be despoiled of all their virtue or charm when rendered into another ; nevertheless , this view is unacceptable because it assigns to the mere sound or physical vibration a virtue which it can not possibly possess . We may admit that the charm of a phrase or a line of verse is inseparable from the individual words in which it is embodied , but we must consider the individuality of the words to consist // not in the particular form of their sound , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are moving . Translation , then , of a work of art is possible only when there are to be found words which are at the same point of transition along the same series of ideas in the one language as in the other . Hence , we may say that translation is sometimes possible between languages closely allied to one another , but rarely , if ever , possible between languages which have developed on wholly independent lines . Hence we may infer that an artificial language , such as Esperanto , can never acquire any literary value , although it may possibly provide a useful vehicle of scientific or philosophic thought ; for , as we have shown , the literary instinct consists in a fine sensitiveness to the ulterior signification of words , and the literary art consists in choosing words with due regard to every overtone of meaning ; but the words of a language artificially created can have no more ulterior signification than the signs of algebra : a language which has no past can have no future ; it is doomed to exist , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another important inference to be drawn from the foregoing data . When a name is transferred from one idea to another , it is always by virtue of some element common to // both that the transference is made ; e.g. when the name " pedigree " ( " pied de grue " ) is transferred from the foot of a bird to a genealogical diagram , it is by virtue of a shape common to both that the name is transferred from one to the other . When , however , a name has been twice transferred , there may be nothing common to the extreme terms between which the transference occurs ; e.g. if a name is transferred from A to B and from B to C , there may be nothing common to the notions A and C. ; or , again , if a name is transferred from A to B and from A to C , there may be nothing common to the notions B and C. For example , the word " gentleman " means originally a man of noble birth , i.e. born of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commonly the inheritance of two things : firstly , of a temperament zealous of honour and fearful of dishonour , and secondly , of the wealth by which the community is accustomed to recompense those who have served it by illustrious deeds . The word " gentleman " has been transferred from its first meaning " nobleman " to each of these characteristics of nobility , so that it means on the one hand a man of whatever rank who is zealous of honour , and on the other a man of whatever character who possesses hereditary wealth . Ideas such as those conveyed by the // word " gentleman " are what Aristotle calls homonymous , that is to say , different in kind yet bearing the same name ; and it is these homo nymous = ideas which are the most frequent cause of philosophic error and of vain metaphysical enquiry . For one of the favourite pursuits of philosophy is to seek the definition of common names , e.g. to ask , What is the beautiful ? What is art ? What is humour ? What is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the names whose definition is sought is applied homonymously , the search is a hopeless one , for it is to seek the common element in ideas which have nothing in common , except a common ancestry . Such are the theoretical results of our study of name-transference ; we will now turn to the practical conclusions to be drawn from the same data . If it be true , as we have striven to show , that the individuality of a word consists in the // sum of its past and present significations , in so far as these are present to the consciousness of the hearer , and if the art of the literary craftsman consists in using each word in such a way that it does not obscure but rather illuminates the individuality of its neighbours , it must follow that the same words will not have the same individuality for the educated and for the uneducated ( since the former alone will be conscious of the full signification of the imported elements of English ) , and the same language will be the same in sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ; hence those verbal felicities which thrill the one will leave the other unmoved , and what in literature appears excellent to the former will appear worthless to the latter , and conversely . Now , this is exactly what we may observe to be the case : the appreciation of English literature both past and present is a monopoly of the few , and though we English regard ourselves as one nation , we lack the strongest bond of national unity ? a common language and a common art . But not only are the uneducated excluded from the enjoyment of their own nation 's literature , they are equally debarred from participation in its science and philosophy ; in order to understand how this is so , we must consider again the way in which words first become significant of // Ideas and how the language of science and philosophy is developed . The only way in which a sound can be made significant of an idea is to bring the sound and the idea simultaneously into the mind of the hearer ; and the only way in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by indication , by representation , or by signification . Thus , if I wish to make the word " hat " significant to a Frenchman ignorant of its meaning , I must either show him a hat or a picture of a hat , and then utter the sound " hat , " or else without showing him anything say " Hat means chapeau . " In this case I am dealing with one who has already mastered one language , and so I can employ signification ; if , however , I am dealing with a child who has not yet mastered one language , signification is useless , since by hypothesis the sign " hat " signifies nothing as yet ; there is no use telling it that " hat means hat . " It is clear , then , that the meaning of words in the first place can only be taught by indication or representation . Now , the only ideas which can be indicated or represented are ideas of sense ; how then is it possible that words can be made to signify ideas not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? This can be done by analogy , or , as mathema68 THE PHILOSOPHY OF SPEECH ticians call it , proportion . Let us suppose that I wished to convey to some one the notion of the number 20 , but had no name for this number , and no means of indicating it Lo his senses ; yet if I could convey the notion of the relation of z to io , and also the notion of 2 , I could convey the notion of 20 . So if I can convey the notion of a workman and his work and of the universe , all of which can be seen and touched , I can convey the notion of a Creator who can not be seen or touched or in any way perceived . If I can convey the notion of a letter and of a word and of the world , all of which can be seen and shown , I can convey the notion of an " element " which can not be seen or shown . It appears , then , that every name must convey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing , and no man knows the meaning of any word unless he knows what sensible image it conveys or formerly conveyed . " lints no man knows the meaning of a " crude " work of art , unless he knows that crude formerly meant raw , or of a " coruscating " style unless he knows that coruscating formerly meant sparkling ; or of " evolution " unless he knows that evolution formerly meant unrolling . It is utterly impossible to apprehend the ideas which these words convey without the mediation of some sensible // image ; once a word becomes disconnected with the sensible image with which it was formerly connected it becomes useless , a mere encumbrance to the language , a piece of dropsical verbiage , a pitfall for the careless thinker , a cloak of sham learning , pseudo-science , and all manner of imposture . Ideas , then , are related to each other as the rungs of a ladder , of which the higher can only be reached by those who have ascended the lower . Now , as we have shown elsewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we desire to convey a sensuous idea we commonly use a native English word , but when we wish to convey an extra-sensuous idea we use the corresponding word in Latin or Greek ; thus , when we wish to speak of looking with the eyes we call it looking , but when we speak of looking with the mind we call it speculation ; when we wish to indicate that food is tasteless we call it tasteless , but when we wish to indicate the analogous quality in literature we call it insipidity . Tn other words , tile ladder of ideas conveyed by the English language is broken short , half-way up , and the higher altitudes of thought are only reached by another ladder , the Latin tongue . In order , therefore , that an English-speaking person may ascend this ladder , he must start again at the bottom // and climb its lower rungs ? that is to say , he must master the elements of the Latin tongue ; otherwise the upper reaches of thought will remain for ever inaccessible to him . CHAPTER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the door of the grammar-school there hangs a curtain , yet is that curtain the shroud of falsehood , not the veil of mysteries. ? ST . AUGUSTINE . I THE " science " of English Grammar begins with a series of definitions . Let us examine them in order . " A noun is the name of anything . " Now , noun and name are two forms of the same word . This definition , then , transgresses the first rule of definition ; it repeats the word which it seeks to define . We are left , then , to suppose that this is not a logical definition of a term , but a gloss upon an alien word . In that case the words " of anything " are not wanted . Name is a relative term and implies the co-existence of something named ; but in translating the word noun it is not necessary to expound its logical bearings . If I look up the word filius in the dictionary , I do not expect to be told that flius means the 71 // " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say that filius means " son . " As a definition of a term , then , the above statement is inadequate , as a gloss upon a word it is redundant . " Nouns are divided into common nouns , proper nouns , abstract nouns , and collective nouns . " This is as though we should say , " Animals are divided into sea animals , land animals , American animals , and tame animals , " or " Scotland is divided into Highlands , Lowlands , West Scotland , and Argyll . " The subdivisions of a genus should be mutually exclusive ; these divisions overlap in all directions . Three principles of classification are here confused , one grammatical , one logical , and one metaphysical . First , there is the distinction between common and proper , which is a distinction of names ; then the distinction between abstract and concrete , which is a distinction not of names but of ideas ; thirdly , the distinction between individual and dividual , i.e. collective , which is a distinction not of names , nor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three genders , masculine , feminine , and neuter . Names of males are masculine nouns , names of females are feminine nouns , names of sexless things are neuter nouns . " This is as though we should say , " Nouns are of three political sects , Liberal , Conservative , // and Non-party . Names of Liberals are Liberal nouns , names of Conservatives are Conservative nouns , names of non-political things are Nonparty nouns . " The facts of gender are these . Greek names were divided into three gene , or kinds , according to certain peculiarities of form . As the majority of the names of males were of one form , this received the name " the male kind , " arsen genos . As the majority of the names of females were of another form , this received the name " the female kind , " thelu genos . The third kind was called in early times " the between kind , " metaxu genos , and later the " neither kind , " oudeteron genos , which in Latin became neutrum genus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English names , the statement that English nouns are of three genders is utterly pointless . " A verb is a word by means of which we make an assertion . " Now , definition is per genus et propriunz ; that is to say , we define a thing by stating its " kind " and some property which belongs to it and no other member of that kind . Thus a man can be defined as " an animal which laughs . " We know that this definition is true because the definition and the term defined are convertible . Every man is an animal which can laugh , and every animal which can laugh is // a man . If then the above is a true definition of a verb we can say , " Every word by which we make an assertion is a verb , and every verb is a word by which we make an assertion . " Each of these statements is glaringly untrue . Consider the following sentences : " Come into the garden , Maud . " " If I were king @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentences contains a verb , yet none of them makes an assertion . Consider again the following : " Great Liberal Victory at Preston . " " Wet Paint ! " Yes . " " The more the merrier . " ' In vino veritas . " Each of these sentences makes an assertion , yet none of them contains a verb . Moreover , the distinction between a verb and other parts of speech is only found in languages belonging to the same structural type as our own . If then every word by which we make an assertion is a verb , and verbs are unknown to the majority of the human race , the majority of the race are incapable of making assertions . Furthermore , assertions can be made without speech at all . If I glance at my neighbour , indi- // sate a third person and tap my forehead , I assert that the third person is soft-witted , just as well t ! - ; if I employed spoken language . In this connection it is worthy of note that the word assertion originally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Asserere manuin means to lay hands on a piece of property ( especially a slave ) in token of laying claim to it . It is true , of course , that we do use verbs in making assertions very frequently , but we also use most of the other " parts of speech . " If we begin by saying that a verb is a word by which we make an assertion , we can continue , " a noun is a word by which we ask a question ; an adjective is a word by which we give a command . " All these statements are equally true and equally inane . " Verb is derived from the Latin word verbum , ' a word , ' and is so called because it is the most important word in the sentence . " Now , the Roman grammarians may have been stupid , but they were not so stupid as this remark would lead us to suppose . No word in a statement is by nature more important than any other , although any word may be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Socrates is mortal , " all three words are essential parts of the statement , and none is , by its own right , more important than any other . If , however , there is any prefer // ence to be given , we must say that nouns and adjectives are more important than verbs , for the verb is the part of speech which can be most often omitted without loss of clearness . The facts of the matter are these . The Greeks called a verb rhema , which means " something said . " This term is not inapt , because most forms of the Greek verb contain both " subject and predicate " and are complete statements ; grapho means not " Write , " but " I write . " The Romans , having no form corresponding to the Greek word rhema , translated it very inadequately by the word verbum . The term is doubly unsatisfactory in English Grammar . First , because the Latin verbum does not translate the Greek rhema , and secondly , because the Greek rhema does not correspond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word which is used to limit the meaning of a noun . " This statement appears at first sight to contradict the most evident facts , for to limit means to restrict , and the effect of placing an adjective against a noun is not to restrict , but to expand the meaning conveyed . The matter becomes clear , however , when we discern in the wording of this definition some dim and muddled recollection of the logical statement that an adjective increases the content of a name , but limits its extent . The word meaning , // however , comprises both content and extent . If asked the meaning of the word metal , I might reply " a hard shiny substance , " or else , " gold , iron , silver , etc . " The definition , therefore , as above worded is ambiguous and pointless . If , however , we restrict the word meaning to denote the extent of a name , the definition becomes untrue . It may be granted that the effect of placing an adjective before a name is often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not the purpose for which it is used . The purpose for which we use the adjective is to extend the content of the name . When I say that " Solomon was a wise king , " my object in using the word wise is not to limit the potential applicability of the word king , but to increase its actual content . How has it come about that the English nation has no better intellectual food to offer to its children than this parody of science , this amazing concatenation of explanations which obscure , of definitions which confound , of statements which either state nothing or state what is patently untrue ? The question may best be answered by dividing it into two , and enquiring severally , Why are English children taught this science ? and How has this science come into existence ? The adoption of English Grammar as a subject of instruction in our national schools is an out78 THE PHILOSOPHY OF SPEECH come of the same fallacy which has sterilised our national education from the root upwards . In the early part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universal education was at length embodied in a series of legislative Acts , it became necessary to decide more precisely than the philosophers had done what were the chief constituents of this wonder-working charm , which conferred such advantages on those who possessed it and such disabilities on those who lacked it . Now , from the Middle Ages down to that time , education had been identified with the study of Latin ; for no other purpose were founded all our public schools and universities . Many circumstances , however , conspired to defeat the claims of Latin as a subject of national instruction . The Victorian was an age not of scholarship , but of science . It was in this direction that new worlds of thought and new fields of action were being opened up . The wave of classic culture that burst over Europe in the fifteenth century had spent its force , and a new wave was gathering strength in its make . " I'lie Pctrarchs of this period were to be fuund , not in the library , but in the laboratory ; and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scholarship fell . Huxley , Herbert Spencer , and others had written vehemently protesting against the regard // still paid to the study of Greek and Latin , maintaining that the elements of physical science were of more universal interest than those of any other , and were better fitted than the dead languages of Greece and Rome to form the basis of a national education . Moreover , the decay of Latin teaching ( the causes of which we shall examine in a later chapter ) was already far advanced . The aim of our public schools was no longer to impart an easy and copious Latinity , such as our forefathers took pride in , nor yet the gift of readily translating the best classical authors ; but to develop a curious exotic and sterile species of accomplishment , a faultless Ciceronian prose style . For the accomplishment of this end , not less than ten years were required , of which the first five must needs be devoted to preliminary labouring of the soil , by means of syntactical exercises Naturally , therefore , it was felt that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quit study for ever at the age of fourteen years . So it came about that the ship of national education was launched , but its chief cargo was left behind . The play of " Hamlet " was enacted , but to save time the character of the Prince of Denmark was omitted . It was felt , however , that some such discipline as that afforded // by the study of Latin Grammar was an essential ingredient of education . This need was supplied by taking the current textbooks on Latin Grammar and , after abstracting the Latin , reprinting them under the title " English Grammar . " The same decision was reached by another process of reasoning . It is a peculiarity of this country that the wealthier classes throughout the country speak a tongue distinct in idiom and intonation from that of the poorer classes . In the most distant and secluded village of the king , dom , you will find a small knot of more or less well-to-do persons , including the parson , the squire , and the doctor , who speak a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dwell , but identical with the dialect of a similar small knot of persons in every village of the kingdom . This uniformity of speech among the wealthy in all parts of the country is an outcome of our university system . To the centres of Oxford and Cambridge the sons of the gentry and the professional classes congregate year by year and live together for a short time in close intimacy . During this period every . trace of native accent and local idiom is rubbed away by constant social intercourse and a perfect uniformity of speech is established . From Oxford and Cambridge these men are scattered once more into every part of the king- // ( loin , and wherever they are found their speech is accepted as the standard of correct English . Through the Public Schools , where they are employed as teachers , their influence is most widely felt ; in fact , the dialect in question is acquired by all whose parents are wealthy enough to give them a public-school training . Now , where teachers trained in our universities or by university men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classes , they observed that the speech of these children differed in many respects from their own , and with an egoism such as we can easily understand and pardon , they took for granted that their own forms of speech were right ' and those of the poor wrong and , knowing that the errors which they themselves had made in writing Latin or French were corrected by learning Latin and French Grammar , they inferred that errors in speaking English were to be corrected by learning English Grammar . That this inference is based upon wholly false premises we shall endeavour to show elsewhere . There is nothing grammatically wrong in the dialects of the poor , or grammatically right in the dialect of the rich . " The grammatical correctness or incorrectness of an expression , " says Professor Sayce , " depends upon its intelligibility , that is to say , upon the ordinary use and 6 // custom of a particular language . Whatever is so unfamiliar as not to be generally understood is also ungrammatical . In other words , it is contrary to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consent . . . . Thus , in the dialect of West Somerset , thee is the nominative of the second personal pronoun ; while in cultivated English the plural accusative you has come to represent a nominative singular . Both are grammatically correct within the sphere of their respective dialects but no further . You would be as ungrammatical in West Somerset as thee in classical English , and both would have been equally ungrammatical in Early English . Grammatical propriety is nothing more than the established usage of a particular body of speakers at a particular time in their history . " ' Im and me 's next , " cries the London schoolboy , claiming his turn at the wicket . " What should you have said instead of that ? exclaims the schoolmaster , standing near . " He and I are next , " replies the boy promptly . " Why ( lid you not say it then ? " " Because they 'd all laugh at nee , if I talked like that , sir . " Now , it is evident that " within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressions // in question were grammatically correct ; that is to l say , both were intelligible and agreeable to t he habit of the language as determined by common usage and consent . The only grammatical impropriety was committed by the master who expected the boy to use a form of speech in addressing his companions so unfamiliar as to render him ludicrous in their eyes . he history of Grammar , if it came to be written , would make pleasant reading for the cynic . It would be a story of the march of mind from light to darkness , of the decline of philosophy from vigorous manhood to doddering senility . The first treatise on the subject is to be found in the writings of Aristotle : This philosopher distinguishes eight parts of speech , which he defines in order , with ' characteristic exactness and penetration . Considered as an analysis of the parts of Greek speech , his exposition could not be bettered . It is worthy of note that the phrase " parts of speech " and the terms " conjunction , " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " case , " which he defines , are all in use to-day , but none of them in the sense which he assigned to them . As the names " Punch " and " Judy " still survive in the show so-called , bearing witness to the great drama from which it originated , so these grammatical terms still survive in the schoolroom , bearing // witness to the great intellect who first investigated the facts of speech . The next extant treatise on this subject is by Dionysius the Thracian . Dionysius is the worthy founder of the long line of grammarians who have made it their chief business to misunderstand , mistranslate , and misapply the distinctions laid down by their predecessors . They are remarkable only for the skill with which they combine two seemingly contrary vices : slavish imitation with wanton perversion of their models . Dionysius begins by enumerating eight " parts of speech , " which are the same as those in use to-day , except that he includes the article and the participle and does not recognise the adjective or the interjection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " but he means not " parts of speech , " but " kinds of words . " These he subdivides into numerous " schemes , " or classes . Thus he distinguishes twenty-four classes of names and twenty-six classes of adverbs . Nevertheless , his exposition is terse and lucid ; many of his definitions are excellent ; however far he may fall short of his model in philosophical insight , he shines in comparison with his successors , and his book is one of the best treatises on grammar in existence . The Romans borrowed their grammar from the Greeks , and the English borrowed theirs from // the Romans . What the Greek grammarians had preserved intact of the original , the Roman grammarians effaced . What the Romans left discernible of the likeness of truth , the English grammarians obliterated . Corruptio optimi pessima . I f English Grammar is a subject repulsive alike to learn and to teach , this is because it is a noble science in the last stage of decay Its decline is partly due to the incompetence of those who from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of language to the practical needs of language-teaching , and partly to the difficulties inherent in the subject itself . The difficulty of many sciences is to distinguish things from the names by which we signify them . The difficulty of grammar is to distinguish names from the things which they signify . All writers on grammar , except Aristotle , have stumbled over this obstacle . They mix up differences in names with differences in things . For example , when we speak of " common " and " proper names " we make a correct distinction between two species of names . If we say that " Jones " is a " proper " name , or " gold " is a " common " name , we mean what we say ; we do not mean that Jones is a proper person , or gold a common thing . On the other hand , when we say that " virtue " is an " abstract // name , " we mean that it is the name of an abstract quality ; we do not mean that the name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of abstract things " abstract names , " we may call the names of tall things " tall names , " and so on ad infinitum . This is how Dionysius arrives at his twenty-four classes of nouns and his twenty-six classes of adverbs ; but there is no reason why he should have stopped there . If he distinguishes adverbs of time from adverbs of place , he is entitled to distinguish adverbs of quickness from adverbs of slowness , and adverbs of moderate quickness from adverbs of great quickness , and so on till he has a separate class for every adverb in the language . How far men may stray in this direction may be shown by the case of certain grammarians , mentioned by Quintilian , who distinguished a vocabulum , a name of that which can be touched and seen , such as " house , " " bed , " from an appellation , which can not be so perceived , such as " God , " " wind , " " virtue . " There is , of course , good reason for making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in Latin , navies of abstract qualities are usually feminine . In order to formulate this fact as a grammatical rule , it is permissible to distinguish a class of " abstract names . " In the same way , if we were concerned to teach Chinese , // and it happened that the names of all tall things in the Chinese language were distinguished by a certain termination , it would be excusable to invent a class of " tall names " in order to formulate a rule concerning them . What is not excusable is to jumble all these distinctions of practical language-teaching together , label them " English Grammar , " and expect English children , who are not learning Latin , Chinese , or any other foreign language , to understand what they mean . II Grammar , the theory of speech , is a department of philosophy . Grammar as usually understood is a part of Linguistic , the practice of teaching languages . The relation of theory to practice may best be seen by taking a parallel case . There is a science , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an art , the classification of books . The distinctions of knowledge drawn by epistemology will be recognised and utilised in the classification of books . Many other distinctions , however , such as the size , age , and authorship of books , will be recognised and utilised by the practical librarian , distinctions of which epistemology knows nothing . In the same way grammar will draw certain distinctions of speech , // which linguistic will utilise . Linguistic will , however , make as many more distinctions as experience may prove serviceable . With these grammar will have no concern . Grammar is the business of the philosopher ; linguistic of the schoolmaster . We do not go to the library assistant for our theory of knowledge . Why , then , should we go to the schoolmaster for our theory of grammar ? On the one hand , then , grammar must be distinguished from those sciences which lie beneath it ; on the other , it must be distinguished from those which stand above it . Speech is a similitude of thought , and thought is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grammatical difficulties can only be reached by referring them to logic and metaphysic . The questions which schoolboys are whipped for being in doubt about are the same which have baffled the greatest sages since the dawn of philosophy . The close relationship of the problems of grammar to those of metaphysic is well seen in the abovementioned definition of an adjective as " a word which limits the meaning of a noun . " It is said that a sceptic once entered a church and , addressing himself to the preacher , asked : " Do you say that God is good ? " " Yes . " " Do you say that God is infinite ? " // Yes . " " Do you admit that an adjective limits the meaning of a noun ? " " Yes . " " How , then , can God be infinite , if He is limited lw the adjective good ? ' " The flaw in this sophism , if such it be , is by no means easy to expose . It lurks , doubtless , iii the word limit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perplexing in the language ; for without changing its meaning , it seems to involve two notions which differ almost to contrariety . Omnis determinatio est negatio , wrote Spinoza  --  " All limitation is negation . " This view is reflected in a dozen words and phrases in common use to-day . We speak of " finite intelligence , " meaning weak and imperfect intelligence . By our " limitations " we mean our " deficiencies . " We speak of a " limited monarchy , " meaning a monarchy which has lost all but its name . In the same way all our strongest superlatives are negatives of limitation . Boundless , infinite , immense ; by such words we indicate the greatest magnitudes and the most perfect excellences of which we can conceive . The Ancients , however , assigned an almost opposite value to this word . To them the " unlimited " was equivalent to the negative , the // non-existent . Horismos , " a limiting , " was the word chosen by Aristotle to designate that form of words which states the essence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " was the Greek word for perfect . Aristotle , indeed , denies that there can exist an " unlimited " in any direction . To be unlimited , he says , is to be nothing at all ; it is not even to be unlimited ; for the attribute unlimited is in itself a limit , since it excludes the limited ; the unlimited , then , is under a unique disability : it can not even be itself . The change which has taken place in the philosophical value of this term can best be explained by tracing the metaphor to its source . The word limit , the Greek laoros , means originally a territorial boundary . Now , the people who first used this word philosophically were a small nation , inhabiting by isolated communities part of the coast of a continent of which the interior was largely unreclaimed desert . To men so situate the earth would appear as divided into the enclosed and the unenclosed , the boundless desert and the bounded field ; the one shapeless , barren , inhospitable , the other orderly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; reek , the boundary was the token of man 's power and mastery over nature ; the extent of each man 's boundaries was the extent of his riches ; so the bounded became a symbol // of the full , the shapely , the positive ; whilst the unbounded symbolised the void , the shapeless , the negative . But for us who live in a land where every square foot of soil has long since been occupied by man , the fence or boundary is more often a token of our impotence than of our power ; it marks not the breadth of our domain , but its narrowness . Hence , for us , the boundary has become a symbol of restriction , and so of negation . I t is rather in those few regions where the barren rock and steep mountain have defied the efforts of man to enclose and cultivate that our pulses quicken with a sense of power and possession ; it is there , in the waste , the void , the immense , that we find the most apt similes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else appears to us of surpassing magnitude or excellence . Again , the distinction between singular and collective nouns involves the question of the one and the many . The schoolboy who is set to translate the sentence : " A large number of soldiers was led into the camp , " and is in doubt whether to make the verb plural or singular , is face to face with one of the most venerable problems of philosophy . By one we mean an indivisible quantity ; but all quantities known // to us are divisible ad infinitum . There is , then , no true one , and if there is no one there is no many , for every many is a many of ones . The only way of escaping from this dilemma is to turn our attention from the world of sense to the world of spirit , whence alone comes the notion of unity and individuality , for the soul alone is composed of parts which are divisible in thought , but indivisible in fact . The notion so derived is applied by transference to those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present , and again by transference to other aggregations which resemble these in having one motion , or by co-existence in adjacent space . Thus we speak of a limb as one , inasmuch as it has one motion , or we speak of it as two , if it is jointed and capable of two motions . In the case of what are called " collective unities , " the two notions of unity and plurality seem to balance each other precisely . Thus an army may he thought of now as one , inasmuch as it is capable of one motion , and now as man , since it is capable of many motions ; such is the ultimate source of the schoolboy 's grammatical perplexity // III The man who first built a fence round a certain portion of the earth 's surface and laboured solely within that fence , neglecting all that lay beyond , was the first husbandman ; and the man who first circumscribed a certain field in the orb of experience and laboured this field alone , forgoing all others , however closely neighbouring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state of a man 's husbandry may be known by the state of his fences and the state of a science may be judged by the same criterion . Where the boundaries between one science and its neighbour have never been firmly established , or have crumbled into ruin , you will find neither the fruit of laboured knowledge nor the beauty of spontaneous nature , but merely the deformity of neglect and decay . In other words , every science deals with some one fact or class of facts , and the truth and accuracy of its results will always be proportionate to its success in excluding all other facts from the field of observation . The fact which grammar deals with is signification ? the transference of ideas from man to man by means of spoken signs . It is the business of grammar to distinguish the various means by which signification is effected among the various societies of mankind , to dis94 THE PHILOSOPHY OF SPEECH tribute these into classes , and to secure them there by means of appropriate denominations ; it is not the business of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logic , but only the means by which differences of ideas are conveyed . An idea can be conveyed in three ways ? indication , representation , or signification . If I wish to convey to your mind the idea of a hat , I can do so by showing you a hat , or a picture of a hat , or by saying the word " hat . " The picture conveys the idea of a hat by its similarity to a hat . The word conveys the idea solely by the force of past association , and is simply a sound-wave of a certain shape , or , if written , is an irregular broken line of ink . Neither aspect of the word bears any formal resemblance to a hat . " To signify , " then , is to convey an idea by means of another which bears no resemblance to it , but is connected with it simply by past association . Grammar does not deal with all forms of signification , but only with signification by spoken signs . For example , it does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of numbers by figures . Neither does it deal , at least primarily , with the signification of speech by means of written letters ( grammata ) , as its name suggests . In all these forms of signification , however , the same principles will be found in operation . We will , then , // begin by examining the fact of signification in general . Let us take a simple numerical proposition expressed in the current European notation : 3 X 7 = 21. f t will be found that three means of signification are here employed . Firstly , we have the signs ; ; , 7 , 2 , I , each of which signifies a certain number . These we will call self-significants . Secondly , we have the signs x , = . These signs mean nothing by themselves , and no idea can be conveyed by combining them together . They become significant only when used in combination with selfsignificant signs , as in the above proposition ; so we may call them cosignificants . Thirdly , we have signification by position : 21 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one ; this is signified not by the signs themselves , but by the order in which they are put : We will call this " significant order . " In language the same three methods of signification are employed . Firstly , we have self-significants , e.g. man ; secondly , we have cosignificants , e.g. the s in man 's ; thirdly , we have significant order : e.g. of the phrases , " this black shoe , " " this shoe-black , " " black this shoe , " each bears a different meaning . // The invention of significant order in speech and notation may be compared to the invention in mechanics of the type of engine in which the function of the flywheel was performed by the engine itself in rotation , a discovery which made possible the conquest of the air by reducing the weight of the engine to a minimum . In like manner modern speech has found a way to make the words themselves signify what the ancients signified by means of complex and cumbersome appendages , and by lightening the mechanism of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to greater distance . In the current system of signifying sounds by letters , many letters will be found to signify no sound ; for example , we represent the sound of " taut " by " taut , " but the sound of " cant " by " caught . " It is clear that the characters gh in " caught " signify no sound . Such we will call " dead signs . " The same thing is found in language . Thus we say " I love , " " They love , " but " He loves . " The s in " loves " does not here signify anything . " He loves " signifies no more than if we should say " Ile love . " It is usual to compare the form " loves " with the Latin " amat " ; this is wrong , because the t in " amat " is a living sign and signifies " that man . " // The s in " loves " is a dead sign , signifying nothing . I n the French word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The characters nt signify no sound , and if they signified a sound , this sound would carry no meaning . In a ready-made system of signification the same idea will always be conveyed by the same sign . In many actual systems , however , we find the same idea conveyed by different signs in different places . Thus the sound which is signified by c in " cool " is signified by k in " kudos " and by q in " queen . " The same thing is found in language . Thus we say " I am , " " Thou art , " " He is . " We mean the same as if we said " I is , " " Thou is , " " He is . " These we will call " lazy signs , " because two or more signs are found to be doing the work of one . Again , we say " He loves me , " but we do not say " Me loves he , " . but " I love him . " The change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing signified . It is often said that " he " and " I " are the nominative and " him " and " me " the accusative case of the pronouns . If this statement means anything , it can only mean that " I " and " he " differ from " him " and " me " as the Latin " ego " and " ille " differ from " me " and " ilium . " This is quite untrue . 7 // If I say in English " Me loves he , " I mean that " me " is the lover and " he " the loved . That is what the words in this order signify in English , though this is not the customary manner of signifying it . On the other hand , " Me amat ille " signifies that me is the beloved and idle the lover . Hence it is untrue to say that me in English is the " accusative case " of I , since this can only mean that it bears the same signification as the accusative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea which a sound conveys always among people who speak the same language we call its signification or meaning . The idea which a sound carries sometimes over and above its meaning when used in combination with others we will call its adsignification or by-meaning . Thus the by-meaning of the compound phrase " cake pan " is quite different from that of " pan cake , " although the elements compounded are the same . In short , the by-meaning of any group of words is that which the hearer supplies himself and is not given by the words taken separately . The nature of adsignificaiion or by-meaning can best be seen by observing an important difference existing between speech and thought , between the sign and the significate , namely , that language is discrete , thought is continuous . For example , // when we say " John 's head , " the meanings of " John " and of " head " are two notions which can be thought separately , and are conveyed to the mind at two separate moments of time . In the thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head , " John and his head are continuous , for the head would not be a head without John , and john would not be John without his head . Now the discrete can approximate nearer and nearer to the continuous by receiving fragments of smaller and smaller dimensions into the space ? which separate its component parts . So the engineer who desires to construct a road with a continuous surface commences by laying down a number of large stones ; over these he spreads a layer of smaller ones , and these again he overlays with gravel or sand . Yet perfect continuity is not achieved , for even the smallest particles have a determinate form of their own , and therefore can not enter into perfect proximity one with another . It is only by treating the whole with some liquid matter , such as tar or molten bitumen ( and by liquid we mean that which possesses no fixed shape of its own , but is susceptible of the form of whatsoever environs it ) , that perfect continuity is achieved . In like manner the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actual speech to .100 THE PHILOSOPHY OF SPEECH approach the continuity of actual thought . To the large stones we may compare the self-significant signs of speech ; between these fall the signs of lesser signification which we have called co significants , and that derive their signification less from themselves than from their environment . ' Even so perfect continuity would not be achieved but for the final admixture of pure thought , which , like a perfect fluid , is susceptible of every form and receives its character wholly from its environ ment . This we have called the by-meaning of speech . By this alone the separate notions which language conveys are welded into a concrete whole . // That there is something more in real speech than a mere synthesis or juxtaposition of ideas may be shown in a very simple way . If the content of a phrase were no more than the content of its constituent elements , we should understand any utterance so soon as we knew the meaning of all the words uttered . But every one who has studied a foreign language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a passage without having the least understanding of the whole . To understand is , as the Romans expressed it , " to read between , " intelligere , i.e. " inter legere , " to apprehend not only the signification but also the adsignification , or , as we might name it , the intersignification of the signs uttered . // We have seen that when we combine two ideas by speech we often bring into the mind a third idea , or some modification of one of the ideas conveyed . Now it often happens that we find a sign used not to signify its own meaning , but this third idea or this modification . Thus , the e in French " jugea " signifies not the sound of e but that the g is soft . " To " in " to come " signifies not any of the meanings of " to , " but that the action is thought of as a thing . " Will " in " I will come " signifies not " will " = desire , but simply that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trans-signification . The by-meaning of any combination of significants is either the natural or a conventional by-meaning . Thus if the signs V and I when put together mean " five " added to " one , " we say they carry a natural by-meaning , since this can be inferred from the placing together of the signs . If , however , when put together as in the Roman sign IV , they signify " one " taken from " five , " we say they carry a conventional " by-meaning , " since this can not he inferred from a knowledge of the signs themselves . The natural by-meaning of any combination of words is the first and most natural way in which the ideas brought together coalesce in the mind . Thus , if we bring together the ideas signi- // lied by " shoe " and " black , " they naturally coalesce into the notion of a " black shoe . " If , however , they bring up the additional notion of " a person who makes shoes black , " this is not by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) That natural adsignification must have existed before conventional adsignification , since that which is by nature necessarily precedes that which is by convention . ( 2 ) That dead signs were once living , since in order that there may be a dead body there must have been a living one . Thus the nt in French portent once signified a sound , and this sound once signified an idea . ( 3 ) That cosignificants were once self-significants , since we know no other way in which cosignificants can have come into existence except by the decay of self-significants . Thus if was once " gyf , " i.e. give . The earliest form of language , then , must have consisted of self-significant signs , which in conjunction bore a natural adsignification . Language in its earliest stage may be conceived to have been something like the following . God make heaven-earth ? earth all dark ? God say-come light ? light come ? God see light ? say good light ? God put light there  --  dark there . // It will be seen that language in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the term . A foreigner desiring to know the meaning of the above needs only to know the meaning of each word and he will know the meaning of the whole . Whatever by-meaning these words convey is their natural and not a conventional by-meaning , and will therefore be apprehended as well by a foreigner as by a native . In the earliest stage of language many kinds of by-meaning will be conveyed by gesture and tone , which in the later stages will be conveyed by cosignificants or by significant order . Thus in a primitive speech the difference between " Cesar dead , " a question , and " Caesar dead , " an affirmation , will be shown by the tone of the voice . In Latin the interrogation would be conveyed by a cosignificant Num Cesar mortuus est , and in English by significant order ? Is Casar dead ? Now , as gesture and tone can not be represented in writing , we may conclude that no language can develop a written literature of great expressiveness until it has developed the capacity to // convey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or by significant order . Since the only purpose of language is to signify , t lie only fault in language is the failure to signify , i.e. the failure to convey the thought which is in our minds . Thus , if we translate " This shoeMack " into French by " ce soulier noir , " we should fail to signify what we desired ; or , if we wished to ascertain from an ancient Roman whether Cmsar was dead , and addressed him with the words " Est Caesar mortuus ? " we should equally have failed to convey our meaning . This is the first kind of grammatical error . There are , however , two other things commonly classed under the name " grammatical error " or " bad grammar . " The first is the result of what we have called lazy signification . When there exist two signs for the same idea it is customary to use one in one connection and one in another . Thus we say , " I am , " but " He is . " I f we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is laughable , because unusual , even though it is perfectly significant . This is the second kind of grammatical error . The third is when we use a form of signification which is both significant and customary in one society of men , but is not // so in another . This is called by members of the other society " bad grammar . " It is clear , then , that , both logically and historically , the first and most important elements of a language are its self-significants , or its vocabulary ; and that the secondary and less important elements are its cosignificants , its dead signs and lazy signs . The former are the essence of a language , and the latter , as they are sometimes called , its " accidence . " The study of any language , then , should begin with the study of its essence , since when we are in possession of this we have the means of understanding and being understood in that language , even though in doing so we render ourselves ridiculous . On the other hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not enable us either to understand or to be understood in that language . In practice , however , the natural order is commonly reversed . We spend years inculcating the " grammar " of French or German , but teach as much only of the vocabulary as is necessary to exemplify the grammar . H , however , we began by inculcating the vocabulary , the grammar would be acquired spontaneously , by force of habit and with little special study . The practical results of these reflections may be summed up as follows : The purpose of speech // is to signify . Hence there is only one fault of speech , failure to signify ; there is only one virtue of speech , success in signifying ; there is only one reform of speech , increase of significance . From these premisses we can derive a criterion by which to decide the difficult question of the Reform of English Spelling . CHAPTER VI THE REFORM OF SPELLING I THE two chief dates in the history of English spelling are the year 1755 , the date of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our spelling upon a historical or retrospective basis , and the year 1912 , which witnessed the first organised attempt to demolish Johnson 's time-honoured edifice and to set up a purely modern and utilitarian system in its place . The scheme of " rational " spelling promulgated by the Simplified Spelling Society has been opposed by a great variety of arguments . Some critics attack it on . esthetic , some on philological grounds . One writer maintains that our present spelling is not difficult ; another that its difficulties provide a useful educational discipline . Some object that the new spelling is too simple , others that it is not simple enough . Such arguments X08 // may be sound or unsound , but none of them gives he real reason of our hostility to the new system -a reason so simple and homely that no one cares to express it in plain English . In our heart of hearts , we dislike the prospect of reforming our spelling for the same reason that we dislike getting out of a warm bed on a cold winter morning ? because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of extreme discomfort . On such occasions the mind is always ready with a host of excellent reasons against making the projected plunge , as that one 's watch is probably fast , that insufficient sleep is harmful to the system , that the time between waking and rising is that most conducive to quiet meditation and the forming of good resolutions , and so forth . Such arguments are well enough when whispered to one 's own indulgent conscience . But if a friend , who has already risen and dressed , assures us that the watch is not fast , but slow , describes the delights of being up and about , and taunts us with moral cowardice for not following his example , it becomes necessary to discover the exact time and to ascertain whether we , in fact , are the fool for being in be , or he for being out of it . The S.S.S. have recently assumed the role of the strenuous friend towards English letters . It behoves us , therefore , to dispense for the time // being with all arguments inspired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contentions in the light of pure reason , in order to discover whether we , or they , are the deluded victims of prejudice and preconception . In the first flush of annoyance which most of us feel on seeing the English language for the first time in its new apparel , the real merits and defects of the proposed changes are equally obscured . Now it is not possible that all the ability and learning enrolled under the banner of the Simplified Spelling Society have been concentrated on a single object for several years without achieving some noteworthy result . What , then , are the tangible fruits of their labours ? For many years a respectable minority of thinking persons in England and America have been convinced that our system of spelling is far from ideal , that it is getting farther from the ideal every year , and that some changes must sooner or later be introduced . To arrive at this position was easy , but it inevitably led to the proposition that we should forthwith set about reform , and here the difficulty began ; for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had any claim to be preferred before its competitors . Even the most moderate reformers , who advocated merely the abolition of a few // individual anomalies , were at a loss to decide how any particular word was to be represented if the ( present spelling were discarded . The publication of Simplified Spelling has changed all this . Now for the first time the reformer can say exactly what reform means . Now for the first time the layman is in a position to estimate how much alteration is necessary to bring our system to complete uniformity , and to decide whether this is an end to be pursued or one to be hindered . To this it must be added that the S.S.S. have had some very difficult problems to face , and have solved some of them in a very praiseworthy manner . The decision , for example , to represent the long a , in doubtful cases , by the digraph aa , as in faather , is agreeable alike to old English usage , to reason , and to the genius of the language . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " hyuemor is a conspicuous failure . Considered from this point of view , Simplified Spelling can not fail to have a certain amount of interest for any thinking person , and deserves a more respectful handling than it has received in some quarters . It is not , however , as an exercise in speculative phonetics that the new system has been put forward , but as a serious proposal of practical reform , and as such we propose to examine it . 1.12 THE PHILOSOPHY OF SPEECH Sophistry , like legal fraud , has two main tactics . One is to represent a simple issue as a complex one , and by a variety of intricate arguments to confuse the victim 's better judgment . The other is to represent a complex issue as a perfectly simple one , and so gain his assent to a proposition he has never even considered , which logically involves the abandonment of some of his dearest and most vital convictions . The latter is the method adopted by the S.S.S. with no small effect in their recently published pamphlets . It will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their arguments with considerable minuteness . One of the first features we notice with surprise in the new spelling is that some of the plurals are formed in s and some in z . The reason of this is as follows . All true consonants are divided into two classes , the voiced and the unvoiced . Thus b , g , z are voiced , and 5 , k , s are unvoiced . ' The voiced consonants are so-called because in forming them we start the vocal chords vibrating before releasing the closure of the mouth ; in the unvoiced we do not . Now , it is a law of speech that when a voiced consonant is followed by a sibilant , the latter will also be voiced . Thus the plural of cub is sounded cubz . In like manner an unvoiced consonant will be followed by an // unvoiced sibilant . Thus the plural of cup is cups . The reason of this is very simple . When the vocal chords are vibrating on the first conso nant they will , unless silenced by a special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of time , thus giving to the succeeding sibilant the charac teristic sound of a voiced letter . What advantage is gained by representing this fact of phonetics in our spelling ? None whatever . On the contrary , great disadvantages are en-tailed . We make this distinction in speech because ( at least in rapid enunciation ) we can not help doing so . To observe it also in writing is to involve ourselves in the needless inconvenience of considering every time we form a plural whether the word ends in a voiced or an unvoiced consonant . On the side of retaining the present form of the plural in every case are also ranged all arguments from sentiment and old association . Not only in our own language , but in Greek , Latin , and French , the letter s and not the letter z has always been connected with this function . It will be seen , therefore , that the dictates of utility and sentiment , so far from conflicting , unite in condemning the proposed innovation . This feature of the new system deserves special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which lies behind nearly all // the arguments put forward , namely , that the essence of a word is its sound , and that the spelling exists merely to represent the sound in writing . This proposition is nowhere explicitly stated , yet it will be found to be the major premiss of the great majority of their arguments . How false this assumption is may be seen at once by considering the position of deaf-mutes . To them a word is simply a combination of letters associated with an idea , but with no audible impression , and our present system of forming the plural presents little difficulty because the letter s is used to represent not only the sound of sibilation , but the idea of plurality , while the new system would be both difficult to master and impossible to understand . It is true , of course , that letters are symbols of sounds . But it is equally true that they are , in many particular cases , symbols of ideas ; and , historically speaking , this function is the older . The earliest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now the most important , neither must be ignored . Nor can a scheme which consistently suppresses this dual aspect of orthography have any practical value . Spoken language is full of letters which can not be clearly articulated , although an integral part of the word to which they belong . For example , the // second c in sackcloth , the second 1 in wholly , t he Greek iota subscript . These silent letters are , however , clearly visualised by the mind every time the word is spoken , and are properly represented in the spelling . The same is true of the s in French plurals , which is silent except before a succeeding vowel . Another example of the same dialectical device is to be found in the argument which the reformers oppose to those who maintain that the existing spelling helps us to a knowledge of the origins of words . " The scholar , " they reply , " does not need these indications to help him to the pedigree of the words with which he deals , and the ignorant are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are profitable for nothing . " The major premiss of this argument is clearly that humanity is divided into scholars and ignorant persons . Such a proposition needs only to be stated in order to be at once rejected . Most of us are neither perfect scholars nor perfect ignoramuses : we are something between the two . There is probably no one so ignorant that he has not learnt something about the words cupboard and forehead by seeing them spelt in the orthodox way , which he would not have learnt if they were spelt cubord and forid . There is probably no one so learned that he does not feel the force of such words // as schism or hygiene , spelt as they are , more easily than if they were spelt sizm and haijyeen . Furthermore , the spelling of many English words conveys useful information even to the most ignorant , not only about their origin , but about their affinity to other existing words ; it reveals their relationship not only to their dead ancestors , but to their living relatives . Thus , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be obscured ; if sign and resign were spelt sien and rezien , the words signatory and resignation would no longer explain themselves ; in removing one difficulty from the path of knowledge , we should have created another . From this we may see that those old scholars of the Renascence who restored in spelling the h which had been lost in the sound of " honest , " " heir , " " hour , " etc. , were not guilty of a piece of aimless pedantry , as is commonly said , for the recovered h served a useful purpose : it revealed to all the connection between these words and the new Latin forms of cognate meaning which the New Learning had recently introduced into the language ; thus the spelling of " heir " shows its relation to " inherit " and " hereditary , " which was not to be discovered in the older spellings " eir , " " eyer. " // Moreover , it is these very discrepancies between the sound and the form of words which start t fie mind reflecting about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all departments of thought ; it is the apparent irrationality in the institutions of the present which starts the mind on a journey of enquiry into the past ; it is the apparent contradictions in the phenomena of the senses which lead us to probe below in search for the thing in itself ; it is the seeming purposelessness which we find in the universe which compels us to meditate till we arrive at a belief in immortality and God . If all institutions were perfectly adapted to present needs , if all effects could be instantly equated with their causes , if all the dispositions of destiny were manifestly for the best , there would be neither history nor science nor philosophy ; for all speculation starts from the discovery of some apparent contradiction in things as we see them . We well remember the beginning of our own interest in philology ; it was the spelling of " though " and " rough " ; long and deeply we pondered the mystery , till an intelligent senior explained that the gh in each case was the relic of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the keenest satisfaction . It will be said that this line of argument amounts // to a defence of all existing anomalies and is a negation of progress . We reply that , for the moment , we are not defending anomalous spellings , but simply showing that they have a real educational value , inasmuch as they stimulate curiosity in regard to the origins of speech . The main object of reform is to save the time which children spend in learning to spell and apply it to more instructive studies . The reformers insist that it is a question of sweeping away something useless , in order to make way for something useful . This is not the case in spelling reform , nor , indeed , in reform of any kind ; if it were , the path of progress would be easy . It is because all change in our institutions entails the destruction of something in itself excellent that the task of the reformer is so complex and difficult . " If the York or Townley Mysteries had been preserved to this day , " writes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reformed spelling , " not merely on the printed page but as a living art-form ? if the plays had never ceased to be acted , but had been handed down from generation to generation with their language , their staging , their costumes , their conventions all unchanged ? what a wonderful and priceless survival we should have thought them . " Why , we ask , is a survival of ancient drama to be considered // priceless , but a survival of ancient spelling to be reckoned valueless ? The reformers go on to accuse the " derivat ionists " of inconsistency . " If those who think that ph in phantom ' ought to remain because it shows the derivation from the Greek were consistent , they would write phrenzy , phancy , not frenzy , fancy . " This argument hardly reaches the level of sophistry , because it has not even the appearance of logic . These ancient spellings are valued because they link the present to the past . Now , let us suppose that there were a question of destroying some other relic of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit of old London , whose demolition was required to make way for some new scheme of urban sanitation . All who were imbued with the antiquarian spirit would oppose the demolition , but the promoters of the scheme would argue ( and perhaps rightly ) that the claims of historic sentiment must give way to those of national health ; but they would not say to the would-be conservers : " You are inconsistent ; if you wish to preserve these ancient buildings , why do you not commence demolishing the rest of modern London and start rebuilding the London of an earlier age ? " The suggestion would be both useless and impossible . On the other hand , if // it transpired that certain of these ancient buildings were not ancient at all , but were modern imitations of antique structures , and if , moreover , it could be shown that as imitations they were inaccurate and misleading , yet were frequently mistaken by the ignorant for genuine antique structures , then the lovers of old London would say , " By all means let them disappear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Such is the case with not a few of our English spellings , and it is against these that the attacks of the reformers should be directed . We willingly grant ? indeed , we have granted ? that much of the opposition to reform springs from the dislike which most men feel for change , as such , irrespective of whether it is good or bad ; this , however , does not prove that our dislike for change in this case has no deeper roots . " Just try to imagine , " say the reformers , " that you had been differently accustomed ; that you had learned to spell the language by some system that really represented the sounds . How would you have received the suggestion that del. ' and Bout ' should be written with b , because the Latin words , from which the French words are derived which gave us the English words , contained a b ? two thousand years ago ? " To this we reply : The proposal would seem to us // by no means absurd . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lost s in " exude " and spell it " exsude , " to show its connection with the Latin " sudor , " we should think the proposal an excellent one ; in the same way " execute " would be better spelt " exsecute , " to show its connection with " persecute " ; " fantastic " would be better spelt " phantastic , " to show its connection with " phantasy . " The same principle might even be applied to words derived from English roots ; for instance , " net " would be better spelt " knet , " to show its connection with " knit " and " knot " ; " rickets " would be a better word if it were spelt " wrickets , " because in this form it would show its connection with a number of other words which convey the notion of distortion , e.g. " wring , " " wrong , " " wriggle , " and others . The reformers accuse the derivationists of inconsistency , yet they themselves are far from achieving the virtue which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their scheme of language reform would be far more sweeping than it is . For if it is desirable to simplify our system of signifying sounds by letters , it is equally desirable to simplify our system of signifying ideas by sounds ; if it is wasteful to have two letters to signify one sound , it is equally // wasteful to have two sounds to signify one idea ; why then do they not exhort us to abolish from the language all synonyms and superfluous forms ? Thus we have the words " decay , " " decadence , " " decomposition , " " disintegration , " " putrescence , " " putrefaction , " " sepsis , " where one word alone , " rot , " would suffice ; would not the abolition of all these superfluous signs simplify study and economise the time spent in learning to read even more than the phonetisation of our spelling ? We were once involved in an argument with a Canadian on the question of roads , which in some regions of that country are , not approximately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is possible to see an approaching object many miles distant . Moreover , they are all drawn either parallel or at right angles to one another , and intersect at fixed distances . We objected to the ugliness and monotony which this feature imparted to the landscape . The Canadian replied by demanding how else a road should be built , except by the shortest distance between two points , and ridiculed the circuitous roads of England . lie went on to point out that the perfect rectangularity of all boundaries was a great economy of land and labour ; for , he said , in a perfectly rectangular field every inch // of land can be brought under cultivation , and no time is wasted in manipulating those awkward " headlands " which tax the ploughman 's skill in this country of irregular boundaries . These arguments appeared at first sight unanswerable , but a short experience of the facts proved that they were not so . As long as one happened to be travelling between two points on the same road , this system provided the most expeditious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened ) lay in a diagonal direction , it was necessary to describe two sides of a rectangle in order to reach it . And even in the former case , the small economy of physical energy was more than counterbalanced by the mental fatigue induced by plodding along a seemingly interminable straight road which offered no variety of prospect to the eye and no distraction to the mind . Nor was the boasted saving of land and labour gained without some sacrifice . To plough straight in a straight field demands no skill and arouses no zeal . To plough straight in a crooked field is the test of a ploughman 's ability and the pride of his craft . Our winding English roads may be compared to our irregular spelling . Both have grown up in rather a haphazard way , and would be improved if certain extreme irregularities were // removed . The proposals of the S.S.S. may be compared to the proposition that we should resurvey the whole country and lay down a complete new system of rectilineal and parallel roadways , using the ancient ways only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system . Such a proposition would , of course , be fiercely resisted on sentimental grounds . What we wish to insist upon is that we should be justified in opposing both propositions on purely practical grounds alone . Lc cceur a ses raisons vie la raison nc connail pas , says Pascal ; and these , it may be added , have often more reason behind them than those which parade in the livery of logic and common sense . II The Greeks had a charming system of determining the penalty in criminal cases ; the accuser had to name one penalty and the condemned man another , and the jury had to decide between the two . English Spelling has been arraigned and condemned before the bar of Reason ; the Spelling Society , the chief accuser , demands the extreme penalty of phonetisation ; it behoves us , therefore , who are for the defence , to propose an // alternative penalty in order that the English public may have an opportunity to choose between them . The starting-point of reform must be a recognition of the truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor its spelling , but both together , and that where a discrepancy exists between the two , there is often a better case for adapting the sound to the spelling than for adapting the spelling to the sound . The truth of this is most strikingly apparent in the case of words which we have received from the Greek . Words of English origin , when represented phonetically , either suffer no change or such changes as do not impair their efficiency as thought-tokens . Words of Greek origin , however , often become impaired almost beyond recognition . Thus ( in the system of the Simplified Spelling Society ) " cynosure " appears as " sienosyuer , " " psychology " as " siecology , " the " Muses " as the " Myuezez , " " physique " as " fizeek , " " cycle " as " siecel . " They become , in short , sheer monstrosities , mere agglomerations of letters , signifying nothing . The reason of this is clear . The modern pronunciation of these words has strayed so far from that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ link by which they are connected with their root . If , then , we // phonetise the spelling , this last link is severed and the significance of the word is destroyed . The Greek " kunosoura " is still discoverable in " cynosure , " but is quite effaced in " sienosyuer . " The reformers , it is true , are of opinion that it is no part of the duty of a word to show its origin . This appears to us one of the most extraordinary fallacies which ever bore witness to the danger of blind adherence to a theory . Language is not merely a system of conventional signs ; it is a living spontaneous growth . Now , all growth implies continuity . Language grows when old words are applied , in a modified form , to new meanings . The principle of continuity in language , then , is the connection in form between the new word and the old , and anything which helps to keep this connection clear helps to keep the word alive . The contention of the Spelling Society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relation to a certain class of words , those , namely , which in form and content are simple and primary . It may be plausibly maintained that the origin of such words concerns no one but the student of philology . Yet even this view rests upon the assumption that philology is a domain of knowledge existing by itself , exerting no influence on other domains of knowledge , and possessTHE // ing no interest or value except for its own students , instead of being , as we hold , a most valuable aid to clear thinking , and therefore to clear expression , in all spheres of intellectual activity . Such words , however , although the most important in the language , are not the most numerous . The majority of English words are derivatives and express derivative ideas . The force and efficiency of such words depends upon their power to maintain connection with the root from which they are derived . When this connection is weakened , the word is weakened ; when it is completely severed , the word dies . As an example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This , like cenotaph and cenobite , is derived from the Greek koinos and means " common , " especially of properties common to both sexes . The connection with the Greek , however , has been so obscured by the traditional spelling , that it is only discoverable by the aid of a dictionary . This word , therefore , which might have enjoyed a useful and active life , maintains only a bare existence by the favour of a few writers addicted to the use of obscure and unusual modes of expression . An example of the latter is the word accidie . This is derived from the Greek akedia , meaning " listlessness " or " indifference . " It was // borrowed in medieval times by certain religious writers to express that causeless languor and discontent with life which we call " the blues . " This state of mind was considered by these writers to be due to the direct influence of the Evil One , and was classed among the " seven deadly sins . " It appears in Chaucer as accidie . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was always hard , that i had the sound it bears in French , and that the final e was sounded like short a , we see that the Chaucerian spelling is an exact phonetic transcription of the Greek sound . Accidie was pronounced " akeedia . " Since Chaucer 's time , however , one of the consonants and two of the vowel sounds have become greatly altered . Accidie came to be pronounced axidy . In this way the word became severed both in sound and form from the Greek original , and though once popular among moral and religious writers , it has now passed into complete disuse , its place in the assembly of " deadly sins " being very inadequately filled by the word sloth . The corruption of such words is due to the influence of the Latin tongue , through which they reached our own . When the Romans began to receive Greek words into their language , they met with two difficulties . The Greek language had several sounds which were not used by the Romans , and // several sounds which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These difficulties were met in different ways at different times . An example of the first difficulty was the Greek u . This letter was pronounced in Greek as in modern French , or as the German " u modified . " When the Romans first came in contact with the Greeks their intercourse was chiefly oral . At this period they represented the Greek u by its nearest phonetic equivalent , the Latin i . Thus , " dakruma " became " lac rima . " When , however , Greek literature became widely read among the Romans , the appearance of this letter became more familiar than its sound , so that it came to be represented by its nearest literal equivalent , the Roman u . Thus , kubos became cubus . Later still , when Athens became the university of the world and a conversational knowledge of Greek was possessed by every cultured Roman , this method was considered unsatisfactory , and the peculiar form of the Greek U , which was that of our modern Y , was introduced into the Roman alphabet to express @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Latin typos . Similar difficulties resulted in the various other transliterations of Greek words which we find in Latin . The Romans modified the spelling of Greek // words in order to represent the sound of them as accurately as possible to Roman ears . We have clung pedantically to the Roman system , although it has now exactly the opposite effect to that which the Romans intended , owing to changes in the value of many of the symbols . This adherence to the letter and not to the spirit of Roman tradition has affected our pronunciation , so as to destroy the last link of affinity between these words and their parental Greek . It is these decadent children of pedantry that the reformers would have us acknowledge as affording a true and legitimate standard of English orthography . But it is not merely their decadence to which we object . Decadence is of two kinds . Milk which decays naturally turns first into curd , and then into cheese ; in each successive stage it is an excellent article of food . Milk which is mixed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remains stable a short while longer , and then becomes putrid , in which stage it is of no use whatever . Language , too , has a natural decay , which is harmless and even useful , and an unnatural decay which is offensive . In the fate of the Greek word kulindros we have an example of both processes ; this word has reached the language in two forms , // cylinder and calender : a cloth-roller , as in John Gilpin , " My good friend , the calender will lend his horse to go . " The first is the learned form , introduced by scholars and men of science ; the second is the popular form which has come to us through Low Latin and French . The popular form would still sound familiar to Greek ears , and would not be impaired by phonetisation ; the learned form would be unrecognisable after such treatment . It is this artificial corruption of Greek words which we refuse to perpetuate in our spelling . The process which has changed paralysis into palsy we acquiesce in , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not . The fact is that our spelling and our pronunciation have got into an intricate tangle ; the problem is to unravel them ; this can only he done by leading them back step by step , by the way they have come . It is easy enough to cut the knots , that is , to phonetise our spelling , but this leaves us with something in our hands which is useless , or at least greatly impaired for the purpose we have in view . The reform of Greek words can be effected without much difficulty by encouraging a practice which is already coming into favour , that of using the Greek lettering in place of the Roman , and so // restoring the visible connection of such words with their originals . This visible connection is far more important than the aural , because the words of a dead language are seen a hundred times by the eye for once they are heard by the ear . It so happens that by restoring the Greek lettering we can partially restore the Greek pronunciation . The English k @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still bears more affinity to the Greek u than the letter y . Therefore , if we write hudrokcfihalous for hydrocephalous there is no possibility of its being pronounced hicdrosephalous . Public opinion to-day is undoubtedly favourable to this reform . One of the first to break with tradition in this matter was Browning , who scandalised the critics of his day by using the Greek spelling for Greek names in his " Balaustion 's Adventure . " Andrew Lang followed suit in his translation of Homer , and many subsequent writers on Greek mythology have done likewise . Moreover , several words which have only recently been taken into the language have been allowed to keep their Greek dress , e.g. paidcutics , kinetics . The most remarkable of these is kudos . It is to be noted that if this word had come into English through the Latin it would have been spelt cydus and pronounced siedus , and its // connection with the Greek would have been completely effaced . Several words of recent formation seem to be in a transition stage . Thus in criterion we keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ c . This word should be either criterium or else kriterion . In the same way , kinematoscope and kaleidoscope are usually spelt as here , the second k being Romanised , the first not . These words mark the turning of the tide . The only other alternative would be to reject such compounds of Greek or Latin elements from our language , and make new ones from English elements . " I met this morning on my daily walk a fair friend not yet well stricken in months , who beamed and chuckled inarticulately ( being still by necessity an inarticulate poet ) at sight of me from the depth of her pushwainling ( I hope you never use the barbaric word perambulator ' ) . " So wrote Swinburne to a friend . It is not often , however , that new formations are as pleasing as this . Swinburne would certainly have found it hard to discover an attractive substitute for " inarticulate . " Nor must it be forgotten that the elements of Greek and Latin have one unique advantage over the elements of our living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that for this reason they are // peculiarly fitted to express the unchanging facts of science . It should be observed that our method of spelling Greek derivatives is full of inconsistencies , and that the principles which we profess are but lamely followed . For example , " aneurism , " Greek " aneurusmos " ? widening , should be spelt " aneurysm " ; " baritone , " Greek " barutonos " = heavy-toned , should be " barytone " ; " trepan , " Greek " trupanos " =awl , should be " trypan " ; " acrostic , " Greek " akrostichion " =end of line , should be " acrostich , " like " distich " ; " stratagem , " Greek " strategema , " should be " strategem , " like " strategy . " Beside these may be set a number of words which under the influence of assimilation have assumed the appearance of Greek derivatives . " Tyre " =a thing which ties , is spelt like Tyre , the Phoenician city ; " scythe , " Anglo-Saxon " sithe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anglo-Saxon " anker , " is spelt like " anchorite . " Therefore , with regard to the general question of reform , we would welcome any measures which would help to undermine the reverence now paid to the dictionary as a standard of orthography and diminish the importance commonly attached to correctness in spelling , and we would commend the adoption of a simpler spelling of many // individual words , simply as a matter of literary style . At present it is so widely believed that to spell incorrectly is a mark of vulgar ignorance , that no one can afford to be unorthodox in this matter . We desire to see it universally acknowledged that to spell correctly is often a weak concession to error , and that to spell incorrectly is to dispute the authority of folly and to assert our spiritual independence of fashion . We would have individuality apparent in an author 's spelling , as in all details of his mental apparel . In this matter our poets should give the lead . This relaxation would be a welcome boon to all ; at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recourse to a dictionary . This is a recurring nuisance ; for dictionaries are not always to be had where inspiration finds us . Education is no help ; indeed , it is a hindrance ; the most difficult words to remember are those which are spelt similarly but differently in English and French or some other tongue , such as apartment , marriage , literature , address . Here the difficulty conies from having too much knowledge , and the unlearned , who have never seen these words spelt in more than one way , are at an advantage over the learned . Possibly this is the reason why so many eminent philologists are // spelling reformers . We can well understand that a scholar like Professor Skeat , who in the course of his researches has seen every common word in the language spelt in a score of different ways , finds considerable difficulty in remembering which of these happens to be in use in England to-day . CHAPTER VII THE ORIGIN OF COSIGNIFICANTS Tx English language of to-day is comparatively free from attached cosignificants , so that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Latin . We will , however , begin by considering two which are found in English but not in Latin , " - ly " and " - some , " as in the words " lonely " and " lonesome . " The first meaning of " - ly " ( originally " lick " ) seems to have been " a dead body , " i.e. something which lies ( compare Latin " cadaver , " a corpse , from " cado , " I fall ) . In this meaning it still survives in " lich-gate . " After that it came to mean " an effigy , " hence " that which resembles , " as in God-like , which was shortened into God-ly . " Some " appears to have traversed a similar series of ideas . " Soma " in Greek means a body , " sama " =image . " Sam " in Russian means " self . " Once sama pribeela , " she arrived 137 // herself , " i.e. in body . Bog est sanm premudrost , " God is incarnate wisdom . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " similis " in Latin means " like hence " lonesome , " i.e. lonelike . Its meaning " some " may also be derived from the meaning " body " ; compare the use of " a body " for " some one , " e.g. " gin a body meet a body . " This word is also seen in the ending of the Latin superlative form , e.g. " fortissimus . " In Russian the idea of superlativn is expressed by prefixing " samo " ==self , the very , to the adjective , e.g. " sami novi " ==the newest ; the same word we find suffixed in Latin , " novis-sumus " or " novis-simus " the newest . The Latin cosignificant " ivus , " as in " dativus , " may be referred to the Sanskrit " iva " =like . We will next consider what are called the inflexions of the verb in Latin . These are for the most part not hard to explain , as they are evidently remnants of familiar words cohering with the stem . " Regain " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the person speaking ; compare Greek " kalemi " I Call ; Sanskrit " sunomi " =I push . Note that English and Russian have each one word in which this form is preserved : English " I am , " Russian " ya dam " - =I shall give . " Amas " =thou lovest , ends in the sign of the // Pierson spoken to , found detached in Greek " su " thou . " Amat " =he loves , ends in the sign of the person spoken of , seen detached in its simplest form in the Russian " to , ta , to " = that . The endings in " amamus " =we love and " amatis " =ye love are signs of the persons speaking and of the person spoken to ( in another form ) , with the sign of plurality added .. Note that in folk-speech " you-s " is employed as the plural of " you . " The termination in " amant " ==they love may be considered the same as in " amat , " but prolonged by nasalising in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - =I love is perhaps only a prolongation of the stem vowel , in compensation for the lost i , as in the dative case , " logy " ? logo-i . Note that some words in Latin end in i in the present tense , e.g. " odi " =I hate . In view of the fact that both ti and si are used to signify sometimes the second , sometimes the third person ( e.g. Greek- and that the sound ti has a natural tendency to change into the sound s ( compare the Greek collateral forms " tattein " and " tassein , " " temeron " and " semeron " ) , we may perhaps consider
