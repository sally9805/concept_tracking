txt MANUAL OF SUCCESSFUL STOREKEEPING IF YOU FIRST SHOW HER how handsome the goods are when made up , and THE EASY WAY TO MAKE THE DRESS , you make it VERY EASY TO SELL DRESS GOODS AND SILKS . This is why the Paper Pattern Department should ALWAYS BE AN ADJUNCT OF THE DRESS GOODS DEPARTMENT . It is hiding its possibilities under a bushel to make it stand on its own feet and make its own profits ; and it is simply to be ignorant of its uses to put it in some other section of the store where it will only be valued for the few dollars of direct sales that it makes . Paper Patterns should be valued FOR THE DRESS GOODS AND SILKS THAT THEY SILL but how few merchants realize it ? Perhaps you have a competitor who has a bigger reputation for Silks and Dress Goods than you have , and it may not be easy to buy bigger stocks , or sell for lower prices , OR TO GET IT PUBLICLY KNOWN IF YOU r DID 1 ) 0 THIS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ startling Sale of Notions or to a unique demonstration of what can be done with Paper Patterns , and thus MULTIPLY YOUR SALES OF FABRICS . BRAINS are vastly more valuable than Big Stocks in getting bigger sales ; and the merchant who gets filled with CONFIDENCE in his own store and his own goods , and who is ALIVE TO THINK AND ACT , does n't need to worry about a bigger competitor , who has larger stocks and a liner store . Right at this moment PuSH NEW GOODS TO THE FRONT . Of course there must be a constant play of 50 IO START WITH CONFIDENCE bargains to keep the bargain hunters coming ? for you ca n't have a busy store without them : but do n't forget that THE BEST PEOPLE IN YOUR CITY are most eager at this time TO SEE AND TO GET THE NEW THINGS . Do n't hide them under the counter or keep them carefully in boxes for fear they lose their freshness , for THEY WILL NEVER BE SOLD AT ALL unless people see them . And it will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of good by having people admire them , than to have them turning yellow while nobody sees them at all . Do the BIGGEST AND STRONGEST thing that you can RIGHT NOW . Make your store a veritable Exhibition of New Merchandise . Have your special counters for bargains and cheap goods , but show , in the most lavish way you can , the FINEST GOODS IN YOUR STORE . Primarily , to SELL IT WHILE IT IS NEW and bearing FULL profits . Secondly , to make people ENTHUSE over the fine goods that you are showing . Get your Advertising Man enthused about the New Things , so that you may have live stories about them in the Newspapers . Let bargains take a back seat for a little while . Let people know that you sell something that is not out of date , down and out , and begging for buyers at a bargain . Show them that you have goods that can COMMAND FULL PRICE , and which they must HURRY FOR before their more lucky and prompt neighbors have bought them all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SOMETHING FAR BETTER THAN BARGAINS to sell . // Get out of your RUTS now . If you are in the habit of going into your store through a certain door every day , change your habit and come in by some other door ? you may discover something you have n't seen before . If you have always come in the door with a fierce scowl on your face , stop deepening the wrinkle , and see how things look when your eyes are part of a smile . Looking pleasant at your salespeople may so cheer up some of the scared ones that they will DOUBLE THEIR DAY 'S SALES . I have seen tears of overwhelming happiness roll down the cheeks of merchants when demonstrations of loyalty and affection have been evidenced by their people - hours worth living for . I have seen the crabbed kinds going on down to a nerve-racked and friendless old age of diminishing business ? with nothing left but the power to scold . Create I-lappiness . Arouse Ambition . Stimulate Energy . Teach your people , by practice and precept , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IT BETTER , and PEOPLE WILL LIKE YOUR STORE BETTER . Start the New Season with Courage and Confidence , and with a loyal and Ambitious Organization , and neither panics nor competitors can stop you from greater success and larger profits than ever before . // THE IMPORTANCE OF HARMONY AND ENTHUSIASM THROUGHOUT YOUR ORGANIZATION Nothing else is so important , especially at the opening of the season , as the creation of the proper " esprit de corps " ? the enthusiastic and harmonious " spirit of the hive " ? among all your busy workers . See that there is HARMONY EVERYWHERE . And fill every worker with ENTHUSIASM . What a frightful handicap to success is carried by the scores , perhaps hundreds of stores , that suffer from FRICTION . Somebody standing in the way ? to stop a rival from making a notable success that would be for the good of all . It would seem incredible that any man would stand in the way of his own profits for fear another man would feel too much gratified with what he had accomplished . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are rival members of the firm . The next greatest are rival managers . I know of stores where it is the firm 's policy to inspire this sort of rivalry ? thinking that it is best to have one man holding down another for fear either may go too far . Each man controlling a brake on the // other man 's machine ! Or secretly putting " sand in his gear-box . " The condition is awful to contemplate , but it is far more common than many merchants realize . In the retail business to-day it is plenty hard enough to keep up the speed , if every energetic worker and manager is AIDED In every effort made . It is vital that the MOST THAT IS IN ALL should be brought out to the full . Jealousies that are fought out by killing or reducing the successful work of a rival in the store are frightfully costly to the owners . It would he vastly better to have an employee lift a hundred dollars from the cash drawer every week , than to have him kill a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be secured by adopting a rival 's ideas , which may be killed by his opposition . But one man who is conservative gets hooked up in business with a younger and more energetic man , and mein say that is an ideal combination , for the conservative man will hold down the young man , while the concern will profit by the energy of the young fellow . That is false logic . What farmer would ever hitch up such a team ? The singletrees would be snapped by the youngster , and the tongue would be wobbling all over the road , shaking the wagon to pieces , making the old horse nervous while keeping the young one in a lather . That is always the result . But take two young men ? each full of energy and enthusiasm ? and give them their heads . Put no // handicaps in their way , and they 'll make mistakes ? plenty of them ? but they 'll accomplish so much that they will pay for all the mistakes many times over . And who does not make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are making them every day , while they lack the speed and enthusiasm that would make up for them . Of course , all men can not be young . But all old men may have young partners , or they can employ young managers , AND THEN GIVE THEM A CHANCE . The most pitiable man in business is the one that made a success before he had real competition , and has grown old to find his business going to his competitors , while his young assistants , who could continue to keep his business to the front , are tied hand and foot by a fretful old man who wo n't do a new thing because he did n't do it in the old days . I know men who have made fortunes , and have well earned a long vacation , who are sticking to their declining businesses , and seeing them lose money year after year , when , if they would get out and enjoy the balance of their lives , they would also see their businesses grow profitable again by giving the young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have managers who are not competent and can not be trusted to ( 10 things right , get rid of them . But if you have good , capable men in charge of your business , for goodness ' sake take the handcuffs off them , and give them a chance TO DO THINGS . Do n't permit one man to // stand in the way of another . Give each a specific duty , and have no conflict ? have every man attend to HIS OWN BUSINESS . Wherever you discover rivalry , watch that it does not become bitter and cause friction that affects the business . Be sure that you have COMPLETE HARMONY to start the Fall Business . Then create ENTHUSIASM ? first among your Managers and Buyers . Call a meeting and tell them what you want to do . Tell them about the splendid possibilities for the Fall and Winter business if ALL WORK TOGETHER and if every man does THE BEST THAT IS IN HIM . Offer a Prize of $100 to $1,000 , according to the size of your business , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either in sales or profits , and get them to put in every ounce of effort they have . Then work with them and for them . Do n't discourage any good effort that is made , or any good suggestion . For goodness ' sake do n't say to a man who is eager to do something different , to make more business : " We never did THAT before ? I guess we ca n't do that . " Get your people " keyed up , " and KEEP THEM KEYED business will come , whether times are good or had . Even in the worst times there is big business to be gotten if you are smart enough to take it from your competitor . Next you must get your SALESPEOPLE STIMULATED . Two other chapters dealing with this vital problem should be re-read by merchants : " Ways to Keep Salespeople Interested , " and " An Equitable Bonus // System . " The former tells the value of pleasant words and personal interest by the firm directly to the salespeople , with commendation for good things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appreciated . It also gives suggestions for weekly prices that would cost little , and yet would create continuous interest and enthusiasm . Most wide-awake merchants have accepted the policy of Bonus Systems , and nothing works more strongly for positive RESULTS than a bonus paid on extra sales secured . A meeting of the salespeople should be called at once , and they should be stimulated to the fullest degree . They should be told of THEIR IMPORTANCE to the success of the new season 's business ? how the firm iS DEPENDING UPON THEM , how success is impossible without their energetic and intelligent work . They should be made to feel proud of DOING THEIR WORK WELL , and they should be offered definite rewards for making good . Great importance should be placed on the matter of showing new goods to the salespeople , and explaining them to them ? telling them why they were bought , why they are good , and giving them all the best selling arguments , and not relying upon the salespeople to be mind readers in order to discover the character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ INFORM YOUR SALESPEOPLE . Fill them full of ENTHUSIASM . Give them SOMETHING TO WORK FOR besides their salaries . Let them know that you SEE // THE GOOD THINGS THEY DO and that you are more eager to commend good work than anxious to cuss them out for the mistakes that will be made by the best of people at times . Secure complete HARMONY throughout your entire organization . Take the stumbling-blocks out of the way of your people who want TO DO THINGS . Get all the sand out of the gear-box and bearings . Pour the oil of enthusiasm and encouraged ambition into all the working parts ? Do IT NOW ? RIGHT AT THE START OF TILE SEASON ? and every effort that you make will bring far bigger results than can otherwise be possible . With a store force of WELL-INFORMED , AMBITIOUS , ENTHUSIASTIC WORKERS , yOU will get sales volume that will surprise you , and you 'll make the biggest prestige for your store that it has ever known . // THE PSYCHOLOGY OF A CROWD The bargain sale that attracts great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mere piling up of the day 's sales . Also , the value of the crowd is not merely measured by the additional goods that these people buy elsewhere in the store . And yet , that is the usual assessment of value that merchants place on crowds ; and often their real value is tremendously discounted . The REAL value of a Crowd comes from the impression that it makes upon the public . When people see a store crowded with customers they think that it must be a good store , or that the merchandise offered at that time must be extraordinary . People are just like flies , or ducks , or chickens , or sheep . They follow the crowd . " To him that hath shall be given , " was a great world truth . The philosophy of that truth covers many phases of human life ; but nowhere is the fact more strongly shown than in the assembling of human beings . We are social animals , and we all lock where the biggest number of other human beings are to be found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judgment of the majority . We think that if so many thousands of people believe a thing or a store to be good that it MUST be good . And so the world accepts the verdict of CROWDS . Hundreds of stores are merchandised with the one object in mind of making the store always look busy . Some merchants arrange for small aisles in their store , so they will always seem to be crowded . Others fill their aisles with bargain counters , so that the aisles will always actually be filled . It is one of the great facts of retailing that the busy store attracts more business . Just as " Nothing succeeds like Success , " so nothing makes business like business . One stray duck in a swamp will soon find the flock , even if the flock is a bevy of decoys . So the crowds crowd in where the crowds are . While the fact of the positive of this statement is true , we must not overlook the fact that the negative of this truism is no less positive . The store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is something dead and forbidding about the dull , quiet store . We can almost recognize the musty smell about i t. when we go in . We would never think of finding anything NEW in the deadly dull store , and we WOULD expect to find the HIGHEST PRICES there . If I were to take over the management of such a store , that had got ten so dead that the owners despaired of ever reviving it , I would create some bargain sensation that was so strong and startling that it would impel the bravest bargain-seekers to hazard // a journey through the formerly repellent doors just as far as the first aisle . Then I would fill those counters with goods so tempting that those who came could not resist buying , and simply by dynamic power I would create CROWDS in my aisles , until people who looked in would see that the ghost of the dead past was gone . Only by such drastic action could new life be created for such a store . But , a great deal of judgment must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the dull seasons you will need to use artificial means , such as bargains , or popular-priced goods , to keep your aisles busy ; but , at Christmas time , you would need to study your merchandising quite as carefully TO PREVENT CONGESTION ill your front aisles . When the real , physical crowds are pouring through your doors , jostling each other uncomfortably , to get to other sections of your store , you SHOULD N'T HAVE A BARGAIN COUNTER On your aisles . And , if you are selling popular merchandise , that makes crowds that congest your front aisles , you should MOVE THOSE BUSY SECTIONS TO THE REAR OF THE STORE , SO that they wo n't impede traffic through your aisles , and also to take the big crowds back to where they can be more comfortably served . Storekeeping requires generalship of the highest type , and the commanding officer must be much in the field . The bureau general in a store is of little more use than an admiral on shore when the naval battle is going on . // The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the director stands ready to change the goods after the first hour if it fails to gather its crowd . This is because one frost-bitten counter can tremendously damage the business of the whole store ; because it makes the store look dull . People often get their impression of an entire store from a single section of it . Many a customer , who rushes eagerly to a store after reading the advertising , loses all her enthusiasm as soon as she gets to the store , if she finds nobody but herself has answered the advertisement . THAT is one of the chief reasons why too conservative advertising fails . It may be true , artistic , dignified ; and the facts may be quite as extraordinary as those of another store . But , if the other store puts more ginger into the story , and makes , not one customer , but hundreds come quickly to buy the goods , the selling will be infinitely easier and more rapid , because the CROWDS that come will carry a strong public endorsement . of the bargain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conservative store . The progressive merchant will give a lot of thought and study to this vital subject of CROWDS , and then he will ACT to-day , to-morrow , and every day that he is in business . So this then is the Great Secret ; " Crowds crowd in where the CROWDS are . " Go get CROWDS and your store will succeed . // BLOUSES : FASHION 'S QUICKEST SALES WINNER How are your sales of Blouses , or Shirt Waists ? No other garment in your store can bring such continuous results as Shirt Waists or Blouses . The Blouse is a really beautiful and stylish garment . It has as much character in the make-up of the apparel worn by women as the complete dress or the suit . The Blouse can totally transform a woman 's appearance . For this reason , a woman can always be tempted to buy a new one , and there is scarcely any limit to the possibilities for sales . One of the fundamental principles of Advertising is to exploit merchandise that has LARGE DRAWING POWER ? to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that any advertising which does not make enough profitable returns from the goods advertised to pay the bill for that advertising , is bad business . That is short-sighted reasoning , yet quite common , I find . Of course , the BEST advertising is the kind that not only brings many people to your store , but also PAYS IN DIRECT RESULTS . But what store can find enough such merchandise to continuously advertise // only that kind ? And how long would it take to provide all of it that the public would buy ? Advertising is ALWAYS GOOD , if it brings many people to your store , and much VERY VALUABLE ADVERTISING simply makes people THINK WELL OF YOUR STORE , without bringing them to buy goods at that time at all . Blouses provide THE BEST MERCHANDISE I KNOW with which to secure EVERY KIND OF VALUABLE ADVERTISING RESULTS . They bring very gratifying DIRECT SALES . They ATTRACT LARGE NUMBERS OF WOMEN to come to your store . If well advertised and artistically illustrated , they give a woman the impression that your store has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to visit your store the next time she goes shopping , BECAUSE OF ' 1 ' 11E GOOD IMPRESSION MADE . For these reasons , BLOUSES SHOULD BE FREQUENTLY ADVERTISED . But you must have THE RIGHT KINDS to show , to illustrate , and to sell . There should be special effort made to secure splendid offerings of Blouses for One Dollar . Wonderful values are procurable at $7.50 to $9 a dozen , and a little more can be paid to add to the selection . But do n't forget that many of your BEST CUSTOMERS are far more interested in securing UNUSUALLY BEAUTIFUL Styles and entirely ORIGINAL MODELS than they are in paying little prices . This is especially true at the beginning of the season . The season should be started with a fine large EXHIBITION OF THE NEW STYLES IN BLOUSES , and // the Event should be prepared for by collecting a liberal selection of the MORE ELABORATE and exquisitely trimmed Blouses , to give the genuine FASHION EXHIBITION effect . As I have said several times before , and must continually repeat ? because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CERTAIN GOODS IN MUCH FINER QUALITY THAN IT EXPECTS TO SELL AT A PROFIT . This is because it creates the impression of class and quality for your store , and creates a feeling of betterness for your more popular goods . Then there are always many BEST PEOPLE who are only too anxious to discover things that are FINER THAN USUAL , and you will be surprised to find how easy it is to SELL FINER GOODS THAN YOU THOUGHT YOU COULD . Then , the having of such fine goods on exhibition gives you a splendid Advertising story , and creates a fascinating display for the best-dressed women of your city to see . Do n't be afraid to buy FINE THINGS . But be sure to ADVERTISE THEM when you have them . I had an experience one Spring that taught a New York merchant a good lesson . He believed in advertising bargains and " special values " all the time . I wanted to exploit his FINEST THINGS . He was afraid that the high prices would frighten people away . A choice little group of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $28.50 and $32.50 ? pretty high prices for Parasols . I insisted on advertising them ? in a very small space , and six OF // THEM WERE SOLD THE NEXT DAY ! Women were EAGER for the NEW things . And they will be just as eager in YOUR City . Have the fine Exhibition . Decorate your windows beautifully . Make a fine Display throughout the Blouse Department . Prepare Signs to go all over the store , telling about the Event to people in all sections . 1lave a very beautifully illustrated Advertisement , and the effect will be tremendous ? in Sales in Drawing crowds of Women ? in creating Prestige for your store . Then , lay your plans for Sales at Popular Prices  --  to follow the big exhibition ? and pick up results that will 1 ) e so easy to gather after the prestige that the line exhibition has made . Advertising and Merchandising are very Psychological . The Impression that is made on people 's minds is VITAL to the working out of the largest success . The Sale that follows a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly . Even a piece of pie is tasteless after you have had all the pie you want to cat . The Farmer must study the scientific rotation of crops to get best results from the soil . If he plants the same vegetables time after time in the same place , he will soon get disastrous results . It is exactly the same in Merchandising and Advertising , and this fact should be recognized . After one Sale excitement is over , do n't rush in , to have another " sale , " because the last one was such a success , or your results will grow smaller each time , // and soon nobody will come to your sales . But use judgment in alternating the fine with the low-priced ; ' and have sales of high-priced but greatly reduced goods in between your little-priced sales , and your results will keep on coming ? for they wo n't tire out your readers and customers . Plan for your bargain sales of Blouses with special purchases made at definite reductions from regular , prices . Do n't cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices of your regular lines . Have " special " goods for special events , and MAKE MONEY ON YOUR BARGAINS . Take advantage of the manufacturers ' offerings . Also get special lots for bargain days , at the same time as you buy your regular stocks ? so that the maker will be in the humor of giving you a " plum " ; and you wo n't have to work so hard to get it . I believe in making a Sale at ONE PRICE AT A TIME . The advertising is much stronger than when you have several prices to exploit . Start with a Sale of $1.95 Blouses that are genuine $3 values . Put in a window of them that may be open to view the day before the Sale , with a card stating what the price is. to be , and when they go on sale . Place one or more show cases on the Main floor , in which several styles are shown , and have the ticket tell the story . Get up u handsome advertisement , with the best pictures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are to he sold at $1.95-and you will have a big selling-provided you give exceptional merchandise . // Then you must plan a bigger and stronger offering of Dollar Blouses . Do n't do it at all , unless you can give exceptional value . Do n't think so much about - profit in this Sale ; because it must be done to make a sensation that will make one woman show her bargain to another , until the whole town is talking about your Dollar Blouse Sale . Do n't make an offering that it will be easy for your competitor to beat the next day . Give him something TO WORRY ABOUT . Then , if he comes back at you , do n't go into a cutprice war  --  but swing around to another display of the most beautiful and most expensive Blouses that you have in stock , or can quickly get . When he gets to shrieking about 89 cent Blouses , let him have the street ; but double discount all his antics by compelling public ADMIRATION for the exquisite Blouses that ( ill your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if you have them . When you have done the utmost with Blouses , you have increased your Sales , won Public Attention , Drawn Big Crowds , and made women do a lot of talking about your store . The Blouse is one of the best friends of the retail merchant , and a wonderful asset to the Advertising Manager . // THE EARLY OCTOBER BLANKET SALE How I used to love to sell Blankets ! I do n't know whether it was the soft , rich pink , yellow , or blue of the border , the warm , fluffy wool of the blanket itself , or the good , fat check that usually followed the sale ; but Blanket selling always had a fascination for me . The arguments for the sale are all so simple and wholesome . The Blanket appeals to creature comfort , and it is so easy to get the human nature into the selling talk that appeals to the customer . But how few take the advantage of this condition when making the window display or when writing the advertising . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exploit on the first cold day of October . The regular stocks will be ready , of course . But have you prepared special lots to offer at very low prices , to GIVE A BIG SENSATION TO THE OPENING SALE ? If they are not provided for , get busy to-day . Buy three lots under price , so that you do not have to cut the profits on your regular stock to make the bargains . Then get your Advertising planned and written : " The Annual October Blanket Sale Presenting the // Complete Winter Stocks and Three Price Groups for Earliest Corners . " Give plenty of space to the Announcement , and write the copy about the delights of wide-open windows , the health-giving FRESH AIR , and the little cost of LUXURIOUS WARMTH when the right Blankets are bought at such low prices as you offer in your Sale . Then get up -a unique Window Attraction to carry out the satire idea ; for instance , build a dummy house in the store window . Show on the inside of it a doll , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have another doll standing at the window of the house , as if in the act of raising the window for the night . This mother doll should be wearing a filmy nightgown , and a hidden electric fan should be arranged to he blowing a gale into the window that would make the nightgown flutter in the breeze . A dummy thermometer , heroic in size , with large figures , should be fastened to the window casing , showing to the street , and should show a temperature of ten degrees above zero . Another thermometer ? also of magnified size ? should be shown with the bulb tucked under the blanket , and the upper part exposed to sight to show the temperature of 90 degrees UNDER TILE BLANKET . If the house is shown half buried in snow ( made of cotton , of course ) , with snow on the window sills , the effect will be all the stronger . Do n't get the idea that the only way to put in a Blanket Window // is to fill the window with blankets , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with AN IDEA back of it , will be better than a hundred without it . Another effect for a window would be to show a modern " sleeping porch , " with four or five beds made up , and dolls tucked in each . This plan would be simpler to arrange , and the Mother Doll could be shown walking along the porch , with a high wind blowing her nightgown to create the blizzard effect . The thermometers could be arranged in similar manner , to show the frigid air of the porch and the warmth under the blankets ? " Which will be sold , while the lot lasts , at $3.50 a pair instead of $4.75 , " etc . The whole window effect depends only on the skill of the decorator to make the scene realistic ; and the whole city will start talking about the odd display . If a toy dog is tucked in beside a little girl , in cunning manner , it will add another touch of nature . Doubtless many things of interest-attracting nature may be added ? to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connection with your store , and particularly about the Sale that is NOW IN PROGRESS . Then the Blanket Department should be made to look LIVE AND INTERESTING , so that there will be no anti-climax or loss of interest when the prospective customer comes to buy . Plenty of the bargain blankets should be in evidence , with plain cards on them ? telling about the bargain ; but there should be the most tempting displays of the REGULAR BLANKETS at FULL PROFITS shown right beside the bargains 71 . MANUAL OF SUCCESSFUL STOREKEEPING so that most people will be tempted to pay a little more for the warmer , more attractive , and MORE LUXURIOUS KINDS . There should be no sign of any lack of desire to sell the bargains : but there should be such true admiration of the finer kinds that they would be shown to the customer out of a very honest desire that their beauty and excellence should be seen by the customer . " While you 're here , " the salesman should say ? even after the cheap blanket has been bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just to see how fine they 're making them now . " Even the woman who never would think of paying such a price will be impressed , and will probably talk to her friends about the magnificent blankets that she saw at your store . A sale is often made to an entirely different person when you are showing goods to people who are " just looking " ; for that person may go out to her neighbors AND do the : SELLING FOR YOU . And you may never know why the woman came in to buy the fine blankets that were not even advertised . Every minute when the good salesman has his customer 's attention , he can be doing valuable work , if he is bright and tactful ; but salespeople must be taught and helped . They can not know these things by instinct , and there are few schools where they can be learned . A little instruction and help from merchants and buyers will produce trained salespeople in a few weeks that can not be matched in years of self-effort by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all important sales and openings , notices of the Sale should be printed on big cards and posted all over the store ? so that every customer that comes into the building will be informed about the Big Blanket Sale . People always size up an occasion to be as big as the merchant shows that it is , by his own advertising and displays . If the store makes little of it , the public will do the same . If the store acts as if something BIG was going on , the public will get the big impression , and act accordingly . Then the firm , or the manager , should make a direct appeal to all the salespeople ? whether they sell blankets or not ? to tell their customers to go and see the Special Blankets that are on sale . If there is a unique window display , the opening of the subject to the customer will be all the easier , for a word can be said about the window in the most casual way . This is one of the reasons why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible in your business . It gives your salespeople something definite to talk about to send customers to other departments when they have sold them all they can in their own section . It gives the Advertising Manager something of new interest to write about . And it gives the Public something unique to make them TALK ABOUT YOUR STORE . Make your plans for the Blanket Opening NOW . Have the Window Decorator get his background all ready for the cold Winter scene ? with the house // front , or the porch front , all finished and ready to put in for the first cold snap . Have your Advertising all written , and ready to print . Then you will be ready to spring a real sensation just at the moment when people are ready to buy their early Blankets ? and you 'll have just that much start on the new season . And the EARLY Sales are always the most profitable : and many of them will be taken from your competitors . // PROTECTING YOUR PROFITS What boots it , if you have done a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books on the 31st of December , or at the end of your fiscal year , and you find that you have made no money ? Exactly this condition is discovered by a vast number of merchants on a great many inventory days . This is the eternal problem : " flow can the expenses of doing business be kept at 5 to 10 per cent . below the gross profits ? " And so , year after year , the merchant tries to get BIGGER GROSS PROFITS and CUT DOWN HIS EXPENSES . This short-sighted policy is limiting the success of many merchants who ca n't see why they CA N'T RUN BOTH WAYS AT ONCE . If there is any way that it is possible to get BIGGER profits , it is ONLY by having bigger advertising , better salespeople , better store service , better stocks , and the other things that people who buy expensive goods are always willing to pay for . On the other hand , if there is any way that you can compensate the public for enduring the cheapening process of cutting down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SMALLER.PROFITS. // It is absolutely impossible to get away with it in any other manner . The attempt has been made continuously , by hundreds of merchants , but has inevitably met failure , as it always must . The line of DIMINISHING RETURNS is as fixed as the phases of the moon , but it is not so easy to determine with scientific accuracy . There is a very definite LIMIT to the profits that may be made on mere merchandise . If you ADD something to the merchandise that has definite value to the customer , THAT ALSO will be paid for , and may bear a profit of its own . That additional thing may be service , or it may be only a LABEL that gives prestige .

The NAME has a definite value , because people know that IT COSTS MORE . Such is human vanity . The shrewd merchant does not commit the folly of GETTING TILE BIGGEST PROFITS HIS PUBLIC WILL STAND . For he may be out of business when he discovers that they wo n't stand it . If he is wise , he will limit his profits ? BUT CONSERVE THEM . It is not the lack of sufficient " mark-up " profit that brings a bad showing at the end of the year . It is because of carelessness , lack of system , and // absolute WASTE ? the failure to PROTECT the profit that you DO get . The greatest avenue of WASTE for profits comes from unwise buying of large lots of goods that do not sell and have to be reduced in price . This always makes a BIG cut into the percentage of average profits . One great opportunity for continuous waste is in reducing FAR TOO MANY KINDS OF GOODS , in the same stock , for advertising purposes . It is far better to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use as leaders in the advertising , and leave full profits on the other goods , so as to be sure of selling napkins at a profit when you sell table linen for little more than cost . And apply this same policy to all lines of merchandise . The clever buyer will manage to get most of his bargain offerings at reduced prices from the manufacturers or jobbers . It is very bad policy to be continuously cutting down profits on your regular goods . This makes people suspicious about buying your regular lines , for they never know when they are buying them at the right time . So it is doubly bad , destroying public confidence in your prices and making it absolutely impossible for you to maintain your required percentage of profits . You MUST reduce goods when they are bad and must be closed out . It should be a rare occasion when you reduce prices on your regular lines for any other reason . BUY your bargains AT A BARGAIN . Let the manufacturer or jobber stand the loss of // profits . But DO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either way . Do n't be continuously wasting your own profits . Do n't rob your store of its life and interest by giving less bargains . Be shrewd enough to get a good supply of genuine bargains AT THE OTHER FELLOW 'S COST . Then you will have no worries over volume of sales , and you will not fear to face your balance sheet at the end of the year . Of course , it takes a fine sense of touch , almost the instinct of genius , to know just how far to go in marking prices on bargains , in holding on to goods , at their full prices . And it takes rare courage and nerve to cut prices deep enough to get SOMETHING out of bad goods when that action Is necessary . But THAT is what makes the great merchant . It is a sad thing to be in a business that you do not KNOW . And it is the lack of this sense , this instinct , this knowledge , that makes the failures in storekeeping . For the real merchant MUST @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NET PROFIT . While the superficial thinker would say that one sacrifices the other , the exact opposite is true . Nothing BUT volume of sales can overcome the inertia of Fixed Expenses , and provide the surplus profits . And volume of sales is unthinkable , and would soon vanish from sight , if there were not Net Profits to support them . Maintain continuously your aggressive campaign of // special offerings procured on the market at the other fellow 's cost . PROTECT YOUR PROFITS on all regular goods . Then you will have a satisfactory Volume of Sales , and a gratifying balance of NET PROFITS at the end of the year . // GETTING THE MOST OUT OF MANUFACTURERS A great many merchants lose a great deal in store interest , in volume of sales , and in direct profits , by their failure to accept or secure the always available and tremendously valuable cooperation of progressive manufacturers . The average merchant feels toward the manufacturer as the agile cow does toward the farmer who wants to drive her home , to get the milk , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protect her from an approaching storm . The cow may not want to go home ; and not knowing what is best for her , runs away . The farmer loses the milk ; the cow is unhappy with it , and may get sick from being out in the cold storm . Many merchants have this feeling against being cajoled into doing the thing that would be valuable to them , because they SUSPECT that the manufacturer may also make some money out of them . Of course , the manufacturer MUST make money out of the merchants ; but he CA N'T make money unless the merchant SELLS his goods and makes ins profit on all of it , also . But , while the manufacturer is getting attention to his particular line of goods , he is BRINGING , // PEOPLE TO THE STORE , where they will see other goods , and where they will come again , if they get right treatment . Nothing in retailing is so valuable to a store as the ability to profit by GOOD TRADE-MARK NAMES . Known trade-marks not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the owners of the trade-marks are working with all their brains every day and spending vast sums of money to SEND PEOPLE INTO THE STORES THAT SELL THE GOODS BEARING THEIR TRADE-MARKS . Not to have those goods in stock means that the merchant is losing a lot of business . Building up your own trade-marks is a policy that SOUNDS well but it is a mighty slow and expensive policy ; and all the time your customers are resenting the fact that you are always trying to sell them " something just as good , " which they do n't believe is half as good , and usually is n't . Pick up any great magazine and you will see the advertising of the thousands of articles that thousands of people are going to buy . Yes , they are GOING TO BUY THEM . You ca n't stop them buying those goods , no matter how hard you fight . There is a fixed law of returns from all good advertising , and the fact that these trade-mark goods are being continuously advertised means that THEY ARE BEING @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else it would cease . If You are not selling these goods that are in such big demand , WHO IS GETTING THE BIG BUSINESS ? // It IS MIGHTY BAD STOREKEEPING to ever say to a customer who asks for well-known goods , " Madam , we do n't keep those goods . " For she always thinks there is something wrong with your store , or you WOULD keep them . It pays to follow the line of least resistance , and sell goods that are EASY TO SELL . Let your competitor wear his heart out trying to fight business from coming into his store , while you sell people what they ask for , and what was sold to them before they came near your store . This thing of trying to sell some nameless goods , that you want to make people think are just as good as articles bearing a great trade-mark , is like the cashier in your bank offering to give you gold pieces without any mark on them . He tells you that they are exactly the same weight and fineness as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an honest man so why do n't you take them ? Why do you insist on the government 's trade-mark when the other is just . as good ? Why do you begin to doubt the cashier 's honesty ? Because you WANT the certainty of the government 's trade-mark and you have a right to have it . And YOUR customer has just as much right to have the goods she wants , with the great trade-mark on it that she respects , and the standard of value which SHE KNOWS . And you have NO RIGHT to expect her to take something else because of your SUPERSTITION that manufacturers are always trying to beat the retailer , and therefore you refuse to sell goods bearing his trade-mark. // If you have been struggling AGAINST the stream of cooperation with the manufacturers who do big advertising , TURN YOUR BOAT AROUND and see how much MORE MONEY YOU WILL MAKE , resting on these particular oars , and taking the money from the thousands of customers that the same big manufacturers will drive into your store . INVITE COOPERATION @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Store . Get into correspondence with twenty or fifty manufacturers who are big advertisers . Ask them when it will be convenient to send an exhibition and demonstration of their goods for your store . Then ask them to spend some advertising money in your own newspaper columns . This will produce live store interest and give you a lot of free publicity ; and incidentally create the valuable impression on your public that the best place in your city to buy those well-known and much wanted goods is IN YOUR STORE . You do NOT HAVE A COMPLETE STORE while you refuse to sell these great trade-mark goods , and if yOU MUST Sell them , why not get THE MOST OUT OF THEM ? I have watched the biggest stores in America try to FIGHT against the trade-mark goods , and they have ALWAYS LOST by it . I have seen the Toilet Goods business go to third-rate stores because they WOULD sell to their customers the great trade-mark articles , even at cost and below it , and the big stores would not handle them at all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a LOST BATTLE . // Is n't it better to accept a little less profit , when necessary , for goods that the manufacturers SELL FOR YOU , than it is to TURN THESE CUSTOMERS AWAY FROM YOUR COUNTERS by not having the goods in stock that they want and WILL BUY ? Is n't it better to sell several times as much goods than to make a slightly larger profit , while spending your own money , and a tremendous lot of effort to get your little sales of unknown kinds of goods that make people suspicious about your store ? For many years I was like Saul of Tarsus , and I " kicked against the pricks , " as thousands of merchants are kicking to-day . But I got converted , and to-day I say to you , " Open up the big magazines , and see what tremendous selling there is bound to be of these great trade-mark articles . Then , put them in stock and out on show . Let people know that you are wide-awake , and REAP THE HARVEST that the big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ STORE . Sell people WHAT THEY WANT . Get fullest benefit of BIG NATIONAL ADVERTISING . DO whatever you wish with your own goods that does n't mislead your customers ; but let that be a separate story . As soon as you show a disposition to cooperate with the big manufacturers they will do many favors for you . Do n't fight the great current of advertising . Go with the stream . Get the business that it will send you . And make the EASY MONEY . // MAKING " BOOSTERS " OUT OF " KICKERS " Many a store loses valuable opportunities for the best possible sort of advertising by carelessness , or worse , about handling complaints . I have heard managers say , again and again , " Oh , she 's an old grouch ? always kicking about something . I wish she would never come in the store again . " And THAT is the spirit in which a great many complaints are handled . Now , we all know that the person who makes a particularly ugly complaint is usually a great gossip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and although we may not like them , we CA N'T KILL THEM , and also , WC CA N'T MAKE THEM QUIT TALKING . But we CAN DIRECT THE SORT OF TALKING THEY ARE GOING TO DO . We KNOW that if we give scant courtesy to their complaint ? no matter how unreasonable it is ? that our store is going to get all the worst of it , in that person 's conversation , for months to come . So it will pay us to make an investment . THAT is why Marshall Field said , " The customer is ALWAYS RIGHT . " He did n't want this bad talk to go around // when he would n't be there to prove that the talker was a liar . So he paid to get the other kind of talk going . What if he DID get imposed upon very frequently ? Is n't it better to have people think you are " EASY " than to say that your store is a " Trap . " The woman who " gets the best of a store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brag about it . And the more she brags about it , the more good she is doing your store . When the complaint comes , you are " facing a CONDITION , and not a theory . " Then , if you decide to accede to the customer 's demand , for goodness ' sake DO IT WITH KIND WORDS AND A SMILE . Do n't spoil it all by having a grouch of your own . Do it QUICKLY . Do n't wait a month , or a day . Do n't let the kicker get out of your store to say a word against you . She is a talker , remember , so give her something mighty GOOD to say , and she will be out saying it , and bringing back all the money you invested in her , and much more , BEFORE THAT DAY IS OUT . I remember standing beside Mr. John Wanamaker , one day , with several other managers of his New York store , where we were discussing some important change of the floor arrangements , when a woman passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , I am never coming into this store again , " and she hurried toward the door , which was just a few steps away . Yet it happened so quickly that she was some distance away before it was possible to act ; and it took 86 MAKING " BOOSTERS " OUT OF " KICKERS " mighty quick action as well as thought . I started toward her , and almost had to run to catch her ; but I was able to intercept her just before she reached the door . I said : " Madam , I beg your pardon , but I am one of the managers of the store , and I overheard what you said to the aisleman just a moment ago . I am sure that there has been some blunder made by some one who is ignorant of our policy , and I want to apologize , and , if possible , correct it . I am sure that there can never be a cause for your leaving this store feeling as you do , for which the store policy can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hap-pened ? " She explained that she had bought a wash suit for her boy two months previously , and had gone away to some summer resort , finding , after she arrived , that the suit did not fit . She supposed that she could bring it back any time , and get it credited . She said that the head of the department had told her that the season for wash suits was over , and that he could allow her only a dollar for it , as the suits had been reduced . She had paid $3.50 for it . And THIS was why she was leaving Wanamaker 's never to come back . And they say it costs about a thousand dollars to get each charge customer for a big New York Store . Well , I took the woman back to the department , and got-her credited with $3.50 for the suit . Then she bought a $7 suit for her boy . She also bought // many other things for her own account , and made purchases amounting to about $150 for a sister out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bee line for the front door ? with thousands of dollars ' worth of future business from her . All for $2.50 refused ( perhaps justly ) in credit . When I got back to where Mr. Wanamaker was ' still standing , he said , " How in the world did you do it ? " ( I lc had witnessed the entire action . ) I said , " By merely stating your store 's policy of satisfying every customer . " He replied : " Well , that is the best piece of work that you will do to-day . " There was a woman mad enough to do a lot of bad talking about Wanamaker 's , for she would have needed to go a mile to the next store , and then stand the loss of the suit . Instead , I 'll warrant that she is still talking every now and then about that manager at Wanamaker 's who settled that man who would n't credit the suit . And thereby scores of her friends are being continuously made to know that John Wanamaker never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OR ANY OF HIS MANAGERS , HEARS THE COMPLAINT . Customers of that character are too hard to get to lose any . And they are never permitted to go out to say bad things about the store , even if it does cost a little now and then to keep them saying good things . GOOD WILL is the chief asset of any store , and Good Will is the " sensitive plant " of business . It suffers from the slightest touch . Even an untruth 88 MAKING " BOOSTERS " OUT OF " KICKERS " does enormous damage , for you can never catch up with the lie . Where bad things are constantly ' being said about a store , the loss to the concern is almost incalcuable But , where the store , by its policy and management , can so please its public and so handle complaints as to get nice things constantly said about it , there is an asset growing , in GOOD WILL that has a cash value , of many MILLIONS in New York , or other city of the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smaller cities . And so , when a serious complaint is heard in your store , or comes to your store by letter , it may be YOUR OPPORTUNITY tO SO handle it that it will add tremendously to the GOOD WILL of your business . " Entertain these strangers , for they may be angels unawares . Too many merchants leave the matter of complaints to cheap clerks to handle . They consider this work merely as an expense , and want to get it handled as cheaply as possible . And these cheap clerks may have only brains enough to want to beat the customer into keeping something she does n't want , or making her believe that the store could n't possibly have given her better service than it did ? which PROVES to her that it is not a sufficiently good store for her to deal with again . Beware of turning over such a vital and priceless thing as your store 's GOOD WILL to the care of cheap and ignorant clerks . Seize upon every Kicker t hankfully as the opportunity to create another BOOSTER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this vital thought in mind , your business will grow bigger and more profitable . If you leave this important matter in poor hands , you may begin to wonder why your trade is falling off , and the public going to a store that does n't seem to you to be as good as yours . CHAPTER XV PUTTING EMPHASIS ON BARGAINS WITHOUT USING BIG SPACE During the past dozen years Advertising has grown tremendously in volume . Stores that were then using one column regularly and two or three columns for one big splurge each week , are now using full pages EVERY DAY . And most stores are how leaving out the advertising of several departments every day , because there is n't any space left in which to print these excess items . BIG SPACE has come to be the only measure of importance about an advertised event , because the public has been led to believe that the store always uses great big space for any announcements that are of exceptionally large interest . In the big stores that I have advertised for there has always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need the thought that many other stores must give to it . And yet , I have discovered and many times proven that a very small space could be given tremendous importance by the manlier in which the items were introduced . When a Big Sale is planned , where ALL depart- // ments must provide very strong items , they all expect big space in which to print their individual offerings . But right then is the chance to place each announcement in a small box , in small type ; yet , by the strength with which the general heading is written , EACH OF A HUNDRED OFFERINGS iS given all the strength and emphasis that it would have IF THE ENTIRE HEADING WAS WRITTEN FOR IT ALONE . And THAT is what makes a tremendous day 's sales , , with only a normal day 's advertising . The chief thing to be accomplished is to CHANGE THE FACE OF THE ADVERTISING , and make it look entirely different from the way it looks every other day . Both women and printers call it , " Putting on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . The next time it will be best done with small type . Variety and striking CHANGE ? novelty of , arrangement  --  - are the effects required . All , of this is much easier to accomplish when you have a Big Sale to exploit . The more perplexing question is , " 1 How to gain the largest EMPHASIS , without resorting to Big Space , for DAILY BARGAINS ? " This can he ( lone only by establishing a policy of " trade-marking " your strongest items each day . And it may require a year of this method before the public begins to thoroughly understand what you are doing . But it is like the most valuable kind of life insurance , and is WORTH INFINITELY MORE THAN IT COSTS TO DO IT TEN YEARS , if you DO IT RIGHT , and have then created an asset that will be of untold // value all your life , and which will be the most valuable legacy you leave to your heirs . This is the method that I suggest : have especially designed a Monogram of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade-mark , if one exists , in some such form as is here suggested : If the Monogram is drawn good and strong , and an artistic border surrounds it , it will make a striking trade-mark , which can be reproduced in a cut about one inch square , and a dozen or so of these trade-mark cuts can be made for use . Then , when you have a very strong offering ? GENUINE , desirable , and one worth putting REAL EMPHASIS upon , INSERT THE TRADE-MARK CUT in the body of that paragraph to identify it . In inaugurating this system it will be necessary to make a LARGE and imposing ANNOUNCEMENT of the Policy in your Advertising ? reproducing the TradeMark Cut , and telling HOW you are going to use it I11 future . State EMPHATICALLY that this cut will NEVER BE SEEN except in connection with an exceptionally strong and decisive Bargain that is GUAR-93 MANUAL OF SUCCESSFUL STOREKEEPING ANTEED to be extraordinary value by the FIRM . Then , in using the Trade-Mark Cut , it should be the duty of the buyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representative , EVERY TIME THAT IT IS ASKED FOR , that the goods to be offered is a GENUINE , NEWLY ADVERTISED BARGAIN , worthy of the Firm 's Guarantee . The Advertising Manager should never insert the Monogram Bargain Cut without the Firm 's O. K. on the Monogram Bargain MERCHANDISE . This Policy should he established with the most jealous care and protection , and should become one of the prides of the Firm , and it would grow to become a marvellous power in the advertising , NO MATTER HOW SMALL THE TYPE THAT WAS USED IN PRINTING THE BARGAIN . ) uring the first six months the Policy was being introduced , there should be printed , under each Monogram Bargain announcement , the following " Note , " in 10-point Italics : " It is a Law of our Advertising that our Monogram Bargain Trade-Mark shall he printed only in connection with an offering of merchandise of GENUINE extraordinary value , INSPECTED and GUARANTEED by the Firm , or their representative . " The space that will be taken for the constant repetition of this paragraph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size of the space that will be required for the entire advertisement when printed in this manner and under this policy . And it will be building an asset of marvellous value for the future . // But this whole plan depends for its success UPON THE FIRM themselves . It MUST be inaugurated in a STRONG , whole-hearted way . It MUST be HONEST , through and through , month in and month out . And it must have the backing and the personal watching of the Firm . But after a year of honest effort , it will do wonders in your Advertising . You can throw away your dictionary of adjectives . Or , better still , you can keep all your adjectives and all your Big Space for the better use of ADVERTISING YOUR REGULAR GOODS AT REGULAR PRICES , WITH FULL PROFITS . You 'll find a marvellous difference in the selling of your goods when you are able to turn the old advertising cart around and take SMALL SPACE for advertising Bargains , and are able to use the BIG SPACE for real money-making advertising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for telling your public more about your store and your service . Bargains should tell their own story in mighty few words , but the public has been educated the wrong way . This method will help bring the advertising appropriation back to its proper use . And it may help you to SPEND LESS FOR ADVERTISING , though primarily , it is intended to BRING TREMENDOUSLY GREATER RETURNS FROM THE ADVERTISING THAN YOU ARE NOW DOING . // USING JIU-JUTSU IN MERCHANDISING The Japanese Science of Self-Defence has been one of the physical marvels of modern times to the Western world . The little Jap takes advantage of the savage thrust of the big pugilist opposing him , and . turns all the power of the blow that is aimed at him into an invincible force to overwhelm his antagonist . The same methods may be applied in Merchandising to gather part of the harvest of the price cutter ? leaving the cost of the advertising to your competitor , while giving him the worst of the con test . I n its simplest state , this policy means that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a boastful advertisement of cut prices on trade-mark articles , or other well-known goods , YOU QUIETLY MARK YOUR GOODS AT THE SAME PRICES OR LESS . Do n't rush into the papers with still lower cuts , to smash profits still more , and DO N'T SHOW THE PUBLIC THAT YOU HAVE BEEN STUNG . ACT AT ONCE , SO that when customers come into your store they will find the advertised goods marked at the low prices WHILE YOU ARE NOT MAKING ANY FUSS ABOUT IT AT ALL . // Thus the public will see that your competitor 's big boast has been made about something that is quite the ordinary thing in your store . One case of the successful use of jiu-jutsu occurred twenty years ago in Altoona . The big department store started to cut prices on school slates at the time schools were opening . The little bookstore on the next block put the same folding slate in its window for a cent less . ( It was a 10 cent slate . ) The department store finally got its price down to ONE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he sent home the body blow by a card in his window which read : " Our big competitor is selling these slates for 1 cent . Come to us and WE WILL GIVE YOU THE CENT ! " Of course , nobody asked him for the cent , but he got the whole town talking about his store , and they also came to realize that the stationer 's prices were always watchfully low . His expenses were small , and he let the big store do the advertising while he got his money from the crowds that went to the big store by his clever window cards and his shrewdly priced merchandise . But the jiu-jutsu method is quite as valuable to the large store as it is to the small one . It frequently enables the big store to defeat the efforts of a little competitor without sacrificing its dignity by advertised recognition . As soon as a merchant comes to realize that , his competitor is going to cut his prices the moment that his own cut-price advertisement appears , he is // going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of thing . The game of Slam-Bang price cutting is rather out of date . It is bad for the manufacturer , and it is getting to be futile for the store ? and it has always been very destructive of profits . To-day the cost of doing business calls for more scientific ways of getting customers . The War of Frantic Competition is too costly . There will always be legitimate bargains , and a demand for them , and they must be used to bring business ; but smashing prices on brand-new breadand-butter stocks is a losing game ? especially when you are burning up your money to exploit goods that you do n't want to sell . Let the other fellow spend ins money to exploit such bargains , and sell at his cut prices , AT HIS EXPENSE . // REDUCING COMPLAINTS AND EXPENSES IN YOUR DELIVERY DEPARTMENT Here is one of the biggest problems of Storekeeping , and it is growing bigger and harder of solution every day . What merchant has not looked with envy upon the 5 &; 10 cent store , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no delivery problem at all ? In your store , after the sale is made , half of the expense and worry is just begun . The goods may be lost or damaged ? it may go to the wrong address ? the wrong goods may be sent ? it goes C.O.D . when it should be charged ? or the boy may be impolite when he brings it to the customer 's door . Who has not spent days and nights worrying about the Delivery Department ? Surely the Advertising Manager should be permitted to escape these troubles . But it was n't so with me . I discovered that the " Delivery Department , " with its trouble-breeding ally , the Packing Department , sometimes killed oil customers as fast as the Advertising could bring new customers in , and it was always piling up figures of Expense that tore a deep gash in the Net . Profits . , 99 ? MANUAL OF SUCCESSFUL STOREKEEPING So I could n't escape : for my mind was always working for the whole business . Fundamentally , two great principles are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why nobody can discover the cure under present conditions : 1 . I t is economically unsound for each store to build up and maintain its individual Delivery System , and have either six or sixty concerns covering the same routes each day , with independent deliveries . That is definite and costly WASTE . 2 . The Packing method of to-day seeks to protect every article , from all other articles , by thick and expensive wrapping , so that a piece of glass may be thrown in a wagon with furniture and not get broken . This wastes the time of packers and costs frightfully for packing material . Yet no store that I know of has ever accepted the idea of dissecting its merchandise for delivery ? except , in the largest stores , where furniture and pianos have their own deliveries . Let me suggest that you start just one wagon , or car , in charge of your most careful driver and helper , for the delivery of FRAGILE merchandise ? and DO N'T PACK THE PIECES AT ALL . Have trunks in the wagon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blankets laid between . Pad the trunks and the trays , and make additional padded compartments . 100 r . COMPLAINTS AND EXPENSES What you save in packing material and packing TIME will quickly pay for the cost of the trunks and blankets . Address tags are simply tied to the pieces of China or Glass . Then there is no nasty litter for the customer to bother with when goods are delivered . There is no chance for either driver or customer to break the wares when unpacking . The driver always knows that the goods are fragile , and he does n't lay the responsibility on a bushel of excelsior to save the glass bowl or the lamp . This an will reduce the cost and the Complaints from the delivery of fragile wares FIFTY PER CENT . You can start with ONE wagon for Fragile Wares , as an experiment , and increase the number of vehicles as conditions suggest . Reduce the quantity of packing material RADICALLY ? get as near to the UNWRAPPED idea as possible , and develop protective COMPARTMENTS in your delivery wagons for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more satisfying to customers , while it will reduce your Expenses enormously . Turn the old boat around ? run with the stream ? and you 'll get twice ' as far with half the cost and trouble . Local Retail Associations are doing wonders for the betterment of store keeping conditions . One thing they should do to REDUCE THE COST OF LIVING ? the cost of doing business , and the troubles of merchants ? is to create a cooperative Delivery System , or rather to develop a local Express business that will efficiently deliver the merchandise sold by ALL STORES . 101 . MANUAL OF SUCCESSFUL STOREKEEPING It has been a superstition with merchants that individual Delivery Wagons were stupendously valuable Advertising . But , after giving many years of thought to the question , it is my unqualified opinion that most Store Delivery Wagons Advertise a Store 's WEAKNESS rather than its strength : for the BEST delivery service makes frequent errors , and ONE ERROR makes a stronger and more lasting impression than a hundred deliveries perfectly made . Whatever the Advertising value may be , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of money it requires would do infinitely more good for the business if spent in legitimate advertising channels . This is a matter that local Retail Associations should study and develop . Do n't judge the matter from the equipment or efficiency of your present existing local deliveries : for the Cooperative Merchandise Delivery or Express would be equipped and managed under the supervision of the most efficient and able Delivery knowledge and experience existing in ALL the local stores , and with all the ideas that could he gathered from other cities , from express companies , and from the Parcel Post . In reducing complaints from your Delivery Service it is important to realize what kind of a man or boy hands your goods to the customers , and HOW it is done . Too many stores feel that Delivery Service is rough work , and that rough men must be accepted in this work . A successful Delivery Service may not demand the l 02 COMPLAINTS AND EXPENSES immaculate uniform and the perfect manners that are the standard of B. Altman &; Co. , but neither will it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driver that is so often seen dragging a large package along the ground , to throw it in the door of the customer 's house , with the remark , " Gosh , missus , I ai n't got time to take it upstairs and unpack it ? I 'd never get done workin ' for everybody . " The customer never realizes the amount of work that the striver has to do , or how far he must go to cover his route . She only knows that she buys a lot of goods from your store , and that she will have to go and get a man to take the bundle or box upstairs if your man does n't do it , and she thinks she should be given the two-minute service as part of the good will that she earns by being your customer . It is just as important that the delivery boy should be polite and helpful as it is for the salesman . And it will reflect just as disastrously upon the store if he is not . Every unit of your organization stands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store is no better than the worst act of your worst employee . That is why the standard of service must be maintained at every point . That is why the work of EDUCATION must be followed every day , throughout every division of your entire organization . Every driver and delivery boy must be made to realize that the store 's reputation DEPENDS UPON HIM and the way he performs his work . There should // be constant instruction and help for the delivery employees , and there should be records of work and complaints , and there should be monthly prizes for those that give best service . The more you take your Delivery men into your confidence , the better service they will render . If you ignore them be , cause they have rough work and are so far away from the counters , they will go from bad to worse , and do your business harm all year round . With proper attention , oversight , and recognition , and prizes for good work , the Delivery organization will become less of a menace to your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CARRYING TOO MANY COMPETING LINES There are two things that a progressive store knows it should do , and yet few stores , however well merchandised , are able to accomplish doing in anything like the manner that they know they should . First , always have COMPLETE stocks to supply everything that the customer has a right to expect . Second , operate on the smallest amount of Capital that will properly conduct the business . It has long since been recognized as extreme folly to use larger capital than necessary just because you have it . Not only is it a sheer waste of interest on the money , but too much liberality on this point leads to definite CARELESSNESS in both financing and buying . The actual loss of interest on the unnecessary money is far the least damage done by unscientific merchandising . It produces a condition in the store 's merchandise that is just like a man accumulating a vast amount of FAT . It reduces activity of turnover . It creates a deadly sluggishness . It fosters and generates disease . For there can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this fact has caused the evolu- MANUAL OF SUCCESSFUL STOREKEEPING tion of the modern Merchandise Manager as a restraint on careless buying . The Merchandise Manager and the Buyer are usually in conflict . The latter is always inclined to overbuy , and the former is apt to starve stocks that need vital merchandise . The ideal condition is very hard to arrive at . Too much restraint is liable to bring the croak of the ravens , " Out of stock . " Too much freedom brings dangerous obesity of stocks . Hence the Firm must hold a guiding hand over the two conflicting forces . This brief presentation of the matter is made to lead up to the most fertile field for stock improvement . Most stores carry in stock representative assortments of goods from three or four , or maybe more , sources of supply . For instance , the store may show lines of rugs from Bigelow , Whittall , Hardwick &; Magee , andHartford Co . In the endeavor to show some of ALL of these famous makes , the store may NEVER have a COMPLETE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customer sees a 9 x 12 ft . Hartford Rug that she likes , but later decides that she needs it in the 10 ft. 6 in. by 12 ft. size , and you do not have the pattern in that size . Then you have to do all your selling over again , with the deadly feeling in the customer 's mind that she does n't like anything but the pattern that she saw in the smaller rug . So she finally decides to drop the matter for the present ? which means that she is going to your competitor to try and find the rug she likes , in the size she wants . You may be very sure that she wo n't find it there , // but she will probably find a good salesman there , and when she learns that she ca n't get the exact rug she wants in either store , she will usually buy at the last store she is in , because she does n't want the bother of coming back to you , or even admitting to you that she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LOST THE SALE OF A RUG that was sold by you if you had had the right size in stock . The other disadvantage of having competing lines is that you leave too much to the judgment of the customers It is always better to rely on her having confidence in YOUR judgment . Make up your mind as to which of these great lines of rugs is best : buy that line , and then endorse the line . Do n't decide until you do honestly believe in the line you select , then You can make the decision for the customer , and you can keep FOUR TIMES AS GOOD AN ASSORTMENT of sizes and colorings in the ONE line as you could keep of the four competing lines on the same capital . Thus you eliminate indecision in the customer 's mind , and you have four times as good a chance to have the right size in the wanted pattern . You can change the word " Rugs " to any other merchandise you sell , from men 's collars to pianos ? shoes , gloves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock-keeping is CENTRALIZINGYOUR STRENGTHI . The store that eternally has ONE GOOD LINE COMPLETE is going to win always from the store that has a VAST ASSORTMENT OF JOB LOTS . Any good store has a // constituency that depends upon it for advice and recommendation of goods just as definitely as patients depend upon the advice and instructions given them by their favorite physician . People who believe in a store want to be told definitely by that store , or by the salesman that waits on them , just which goods is BEST . And how dare the salesperson say which of four lines of rugs is best when expert opinion is absolutely divided , or indefinite , and when HE DOES N'T KNOW IN WHICH LINE THE CUSTOMER MAY FIND THE PATTERN THAT SHE WILL LIKE ? If this vital question is decided BEFORE THE LINE IS PUT IN that store has a policy , and the salespeople can honestly live up to it . Then can they say in all sincerity : " We carry this line because we believe it to he the best on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a right to expect to be told . There MUST not be any uncertainty about the statement if the sale is to be satisfactorily and promptly made , and the goods are to STAY SOLD . Think of going to your Doctor and having him say to you : " Now there are several things that will fix you up all right , and I am prepared to let you select any of them that you like best , for any of them will bring the result that you want . Here are some quinine pills , here is a strychnine tonic , here is asperin , here is castor oil , which is always good . Or you can use a mustard foot bath . Even a hot toddy , before you go to bed , would probably knock the // trouble out of you . " What would you think of that doctor ? In scientific storekeeping it is just as weak and silly to mix up your customers with TOO MUCH TO SELECT FROM , and having your stocks complex and confusing , as it would seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pick your own poison . If you believe in yourself and your store , LET THE PEOPLE KNOWS IT in no indefinite words . If you convince them that you believe in yourself , they will believe in you . If you are in doubt about yourself , how can you expect the public to believe in you ? SIMPLIFY your stocks . Maintain the stocks you have in ABSOLUTE COMPLETENESS . Always be able to say definitely , " We believe this to be THE BEST . " Thus you conserve your capital . You strengthen your salespeople . And you CONVINCE and SATISFY your customers . // PLANNING A BIG FEBRUARY OCCASION WITH MANUFACTURERS ' HELP February is a month when you must fight hard for business . Winter remains , but people are supposed to be supplied with most of the necessaries , and often weather is so bad that people stay at home . Then it is too early to get spring things selling without some tremendous stimulus to create public interest . This chapter should help you to prepare , A FULL MONTH AHEAD , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or even a little later , according to your special conditions and the geographical location of your store . All through January manufacturers and jobbers are showing you goods for the Spring Trade . This is the time to SET YOUR TRAP FOR THEM . This year you must get more out of them than you ever have gotten before , and something that should help mightily with boosting your whole Spring business as well as adding prestige to your store . EVERY TIME YOU BUY A BILL OF GOODS insist on getting with them one , two , or three SPECIAL LOTS OF FINE MERCHANDISE AT A VERY BIG REDUCTION // for your February Event . Do n't accept seconds , or undesirable goods , for this occasion Of course , you will not demand trade-mark goods:or such staples as have a fixed price ; but , since old goods and clean-up lots have been offered by you all the month of January , you can only arouse new enthusiasm on the part of the public by being able to announce NEW AND DESIRABLE GOODS at liberal reductions from regular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get away from the necessity of such violent stimulation to promote business during the dull months . Perhaps , some day , manufacturers will not have surplus lots of really desirable merchandise . But to-day they still have them , and certain big stores are being made very special offerings for their mid-season events , in goods that , to the public , have all the attractiveness of the very latest patterns or styles . And so long as this policy is in force ? so long as manufacturers and importers are meeting the demands of big retailers , and even suggesting such offerings to them , so long the progressive merchant in the smaller city should demand like treatment and equal bargains . It has been made a crime for railroads to give rebates to big corporations whose traffic by its volume formerly tempted railroads to adopt that form of solicitation . Some time , doubtless , the same ethical standard will be legally applied to the dry goods business ; but UNTIL THAT HOPED-FOR TIME ARRIVES // the most effective way to force fairly uniform treatment for large stores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for himself all the favors , discounts , rebates , and special prices that are offered or allowed to any store anywhere . By January every manufacturer knows of certain patterns among his new goods that , for some unknown reason , have not sold as well as others , and , under special pressure , he will cut the price several weeks early , on his surplus quantity , at least . But you must supply the manufacturer with a reasonable EXCUSE , for cutting his price , and your FEBRUARY OCCASION supplies the excuse . It is also to his interest , as well as yours , to make your sale a success ; for we all know that the majority of the goods sold in any special event are sold at regular prices . So , the more goods you sell , the more quickly you will be able to send another order to the manufacturer who has cooperated with you for your February Event . If the manufacturer , or his salesman , does not accept the opportunity to cooperate , you are certainly justified in saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man who gets my regular orders is going to show a little more interest in helping me promote my business than you have shown . You have goods that I want , for which I am perfectly willing to pay your regular prices . But I need some help to pull through February , and I must get it from the man who sells me regular goods . That is why there is // nothing doing if you have n't enough interest in my store to do me this little favor . " Well , he will take the order . And you will get the goods . Apply this method to EVERY PURCHASE YOU MAKE this Spring , whether from a salesman on the road or when you make purchases in the market yourself or through your buyers . You will be amazed to see what can be done . And when all the SPECIAL GOODS arrive for your Big Event you will be ready to buy double pages of space in the newspapers to tell a story that will be the most extraordinary that you ever printed : for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OF THE COMING SEASON for MUCH LESS THAN THE SAME GOODS WILL COST LATER ON . THAT will make a genuine sensation that will grow bigger when people come and ACTUALLY FIND THE CONDITIONS TRUE AS STATED . THAT will induce people to BUY IN ADVANCE , and so wear things early , and BUY THEM TWICE OVER , thus increasing the possibilities of your Spring business immensely . Buying these extra goods should not cut down your regular orders at all , for the stimulus from this Event , instead of cutting into your regular business , WILL INCREASE IT ENORMOUSLY if the plan is rightly carried out . Of course , it MAY cut into your competitor 's business , and it will very probably not only take away a lot of his immediate sales , but it should secure a lot of his customers for you PERMANENTLY if you LIVE UP TO THE REPUTATION YOU WILL MAKE . // CREATING DAILY STORE INTEREST The larger events for promoting store interest and prestige must not come too often and become commonplace , else they eventually lose their drawing power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sales have large value , but if the store attempts to use them four times a year , or every other month , they get so common that they do not bring the old response when their real occasion arrives . The clever merchant must protect his periodic events and yet keep people interested EVERY DAY IN ' 1 ' 11E YEAR . And THAT becomes a serious problem . Most merchants fail for the old reason of crying " Wolf , wolf , " every day . Words used , and the manner of statement , are all important . For daily use nothing is so good as the " bargain counters . " Most stores use their main aisles for this purpose , and the public always expects to find bargains there . A much better plan ? bringing infinitely greater good to the whole store ? is to use the most prominent aisle counters for the display of new things sold at full profits . // The handsomest goods you possess should be placed out where everybody can see them WHILE THEY ARE NEW . Counters that possess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goods that you most desire to sell . On the other hand , bargains , especially when sold at little profit , should be USED TO DRAW PEOPLE RIGHT INTO THE REGULAR DEPARTMENTS OF THE STORE . If people come into the store to find the bargains , they will go to the section where they are sold when they come . No store can be a success if people are not well distributed throughout the ENTIRE BUILDING . What is the use of having a large building IF YOU DO BUSINESS ONLY ON THE MAIN FLOOR ? It has always seemed to me to be a TREMENDOUS WASTE OF REAL POWER to sell on the main aisles goods that had the attractiveness to pull crowds of people to the BACK of the store , or up to other floors that would not otherwise be busy . Then , in justice to the particular department that produced the bargain , that section should have the advantage of getting into it the crowds that the bargain brings . People who come to buy bargains always buy other goods , and the department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have the best possible chance to sell its regular merchandise , AT FULL PROFITS , to those who find they do n't want the bargain , or who require other items from l lie same stocks . If the bargains are sold on the main aisles and the regular stocks are on the fifth floor , the bar- // gain customers are rarely of any use to the regular department . A merchant in the far West devised one of the best plans I ever heard about for arousing daily bargain interest in his great new store ? one of the finest in the country . His plan is to have special offerings in one section and another , EVERY DAY ? well distributed throughout the entire store . These daily specials are identified by portable GREEN LIGHTS ? moved daily , as the bargains change their character and location . The advertising merely arouses public interest by saying " Watch for the Green Lights . " And wherever a green light is seen there is always a NEW and GENUINE bargain offering . The green lights are NEVER used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offering . Hence they never lose their drawing power . In addition to the light being GREEN , this merchant had the electric lights put on an eccentric connection that made the lights go up and down , producing a recurring flash effect . The green light appears , then disappears  --  thus catching the eye more quickly than a steady light would do . Of course , all stores would not care to go to this expense , but all stores can have portable electric lights with GREEN globes , or some other distinctive color . And if this smaller expense is not desired , another simpler way is little less effective . Cards in a bright shade of green , or other selected color , 116 . CREATING DAILY STORE IN'I ' 1 ? REST may be used , and by proper advertising be brought to identify the daily bargain offerings . If this is done , there should be no confusing cards used . All others should be white , and the green cards should be promptly removed each day - as the whole plan loses its force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most important that the same bargains shall not be repeated day after day . People must be kept curious as to what will be the new bargains at your store each day , and THAT curiosity will cause them to visit it as often as possible if the plan is intelligently worked and honestly and cleverly merchandised . This plan may be worked either with or without the bargains being specifically advertised . But the advertising should remind the public EVERY DAY to " Watch for the Green Cards : for big bargains changed every day . " The whole plan depends for its success upon the character of the bargains that you give . They MUST be good and HONEST . They need not be in large quantities , because they are " for ONE day only , " which justifies selling out quickly ; and this is especially true if they are not specifically advertised in the papers , for you can place OTHER bargains under the cards , and have new cards made when the bargain goods sell out . The loss need not be large . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the day , would make an ideal offering . One dollar Dress Goods , at 92 cents for the day , might be good enough IF REAL . But dress goods that had been selling for // 95 cents could never be called $1 goods at 92 cents , and bring successful business . One-day bargains should ALWAYS be most desirable STAPLE goods . The old stock , that can never go back to its former price , should not be put under the green cards as one-day bargains , but should be marked for what it is , and left at its bargain price until sold , and the card used to describe it should be white . If you institute this Green Card plan , and have a LIMITED number of strong , GENUINE bargains , changed EVERY DAY , you will find it a wonderful tonic to your business . But it must be handled INTELLIGENTLY . It must NOT become a perfunctory duty . It must not . be left to the half-hearted or half-honest effort of department heads . The firm , or the firm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day for no one else will realize the importance of what is being done ? not only for the one day , but for the permanent good of the entire business . // PLANNING FOR CHRISTMAS The Christmas season is the merchant 's Harvest . Once each year the purse strings of every living being are loosened . And if the being is half human , the purse is opened wide . And the other fact must not be forgotten : MOST OF THESE SAME POCKETBOOKS ARE SHUT UP TIGHT aS soon as Christmas is over . " Strike while the iron is hot , " means TO You : SELL FAST WHILE THE PEOPLE ARE BUYING . Christmas plans should all be made before Thanksgiving Day . If all of your Christmas goods are bought , your study now is how to display them and arrange them for easy seeing and QUICK BUYING . The well-arranged Store is ELASTIC . This means that you should be able to move your fixtures around to meet Holiday conditions . Perhaps this is impossible in your store . Then you will need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stocks should be condensed into the smallest possible space . Of course , nothing should be done that will actually inconvenience customers , but a little thoughtful planning will enable you to do the needed thing without upsetting regular business . 119 a MANUAL OF SUCCESSFUL STOREKEEPING One thing you MUST DO to create the best possible effect , and make the strongest possible impression on your public : you must make your place LOOK LIKE A TOTALLY DIFFERENT STORE . That is the great secret of creating public enthusiasm . You must create the CHRISTMAS ATMOSPHERE in your store , because it makes people breathe the Christmas Spirit , and then they are ready to buy your merchandise more freely . So all staple departments must be set . back , and ALL HOLIDAY STOCKS ENLARGED TO THE LIMITS OF STORE POSSIBILITIES . The fullest results can only be secured when you are able to make your entire building over into a vast CHRIS'T'MAS STORE . This gives you fine talk for your advertising , and it gives the vital impression to the public when they come to the store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give the store the finest dress that it has ever known . They should make it radically different from what it has ever been before . You should secure beautiful store and window cards to express the Christmas thought in connection with ALL your merchandise . But your chief thought must be as to what goods you will put on each shelf and on each counter . Prepare your counters for SELLING . Arrange every counter and table so that it will literally pull the money out of people 's pocketbooks . Make a diagram of all your counters and aisle tables . Then indicate , far ahead , what you are going to put on each one . Do n't waste a single counter on common- // place goods. , You may think I am asking a good deal . But remember that you can take away the commonplace look from most goods by adding the right Christmas touch . No matter how staple the goods is that you wish to put on the counter , it deserves careful thought as to what would make it more attractive and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing . DO N'T DO THINGS THE OLD WAY . There are thousands of other ways . Study them up . Big success comes more from thoughtful study than from genius , or being told just what to do . Arrange your entire store for the Holiday displays , but remember that the greatest power in bringing people to your store at Christmas time is the CHILDREN . Make big plans to entertain the Children . Santa Claus is forever the Children 's idol . his popularity never grows less . The cleverest idea for interesting the Children that I have ever known was the Christmas Store at Gimbel 's run by Bear Brothers . How the children loved those big Polar Bears , and how their eyes snapped in wonder as to what prize the bears would give them . The Prize Package held marvellous fascination for the little folks ? and it was a wonderful money maker for the store . Think of selling many thousands of ready-wrapped packages ? containing articles that THEY HAD NEVER SEEN . No waste of time in making the selection . All wrapping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best of all , // the SURPRISE for the youngster ? and the joys of anticipation ? for the package was rarely opened until the youngster got it home . This was done at Gimbel 's with a $1,000 vending machine , but YOU CAN DO THE SAME THING AT PRACTICALLY NO COST AT ALL . Arrange your own little Prize Store in a space 10 x 15 feet , or more , if your store permits . Then have one of your clever salespeople dress up as Santa Claus or Father Bear , as you prefer ; or , if you prefer to use a woman , dress her up as Mother Hubbard or Mrs. Santa Claus . As soon as your toy stocks come in start wrapping up the prize packages . Select articles for boys and wrap them in white paper . Articles for girls wrap in pink paper . You should also arrange them in groups for various ages ? so that each youngster gets an article that will be suited to him or her . The Gimbel price was 25 cents each package . In London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wisest , I think , to have only one price , as that saves time and makes it simpler . But some fathers and mothers want something better for their youngsters , and it might be worth while to have a shelfful of " Prizes de Luxe " at $1 each , to fill such a demand , but not displayed so as to spoil the full appreciation of the 10 cent or 25 cent packages sold by thousands . You will be gratified to discover that this very profitable " Prize Package Store " will delight the little folks far more than a Punch &; Judy show , or any other attraction that you might put in , which // would be only an expense . They will be fascinated by the actions of Santa Claus or Father Bear , and the mystery of what may be in the prize package is the greatest temptation of all . Every parent who brings a child to see it simply MUST buy one or more packages . This store feature can be quite as effectually used at Easter time ? selling eggs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have charge of the store . KEEP YOUR ENTIRE STORE BRIGHT . It is wonderful what a decorative effect LIGHT has on a store . It makes your merchandise worth more because everything looks so much better . Then it has a cheering effect on the customers . Do n't be stingy with the light during the Christmas season . Keep your merchandise MOVING . If something is n't selling where it is-do n't let it get stale . Move it to some other table . Arrange it differently . If it proves to be a poor seller CUT THE PRICES . DO N'T KEEP ANY HOLIDAY GOODS TO SELL AFTER CHRISTMAS . Keep your eyes open all the time and sell your goods while the crowds are coming . Sell them at a profit if possible ? BUT SELL THEM . Watch your counters . Do n't let the goods sell out without filling in promptly . Get things out of the stockrooms and down on the counters as quickly as you can . Thousands of dollars ' worth of goods do not sell because they have never been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgot them // altogether . Buyers and managers get too busy , and salespeople do n't know . Make plans early for your newspaper Advertising . Get bright , attractive pictures , full of the Christmas Spirit , and with tempting gift suggestions . Command public attention by your striking announcements and the REAL NEWS that you print . If you do not have original drawings for your advertising , there are good cuts to be had , and you should have your supply ready for a good live campaign on the first day of December . Never take it for granted that people know your store , or that you have Holiday Goods . For goodness ' sake do n't advertise " Full Line of Holiday Goods Now Ready . " Nobody on earth wants " holiday goods . " But a statement like " We have the most interesting collection of really desirable Gift Things that we have ever shown , " is likely to arouse a lot of interest IF TRUE . And you must MAKE IT TRUE . And your advertising should tell , every day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the attractive goods ? just what it is , what it is good for , why it is attractive for gifts , and every really interesting fact about it . Of course it takes ability and skill to write advertising , but thoughtful , earnest effort will develop ability . THINK . Start EARLY and talk over each individual stock with the buyer . Sec how much space can be given up for holiday goods . Ask him , or her , what can be done this year that has never been done before to // sell more Christmas goods . Get a definite working plan adopted by every one . Get them THINKING , and keep them at it . Get them out of last year 's rut ? and KEEP THEM OUT . Do every good thing that was done last year . Then do a lot more . The chief thing is to make plans that will provide a fine display space for all the Special Holiday Goods . Plan for fine window displays that will give people a sensation to talk about to their friends . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holly decorated cards for your merchandise all over the store . Call a meeting of all your people . Tell them what big things you want to do this Christmas , and how much you are depending upon them , individually , to help you . Ask for suggestions . Get some of your people to talk right up in meeting , and ask others to write their suggestions and send them to you . Get everybody ENTHUSIASTIC about the Christmas business . Get everybody THINKING and WORKING for big things . Encourage their ideas ? good or bad ? if given with best intent and real thought . Then use the good ones . You 'll be amazed to see how much REAL SOUND HELP you 'll get . I do n't believe there is a store anywhere , employing from a dozen people to several thousand , that has n't got real bright minds in it that only need opportunity to bring them out . It 's up to you TO BRING THEM OUT . Start RIGHT NOW ? and See how much bigger your Christmas business will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CHRISTMAS Toy STORE We have just two weeks to make plans for the great Holiday Opening and the Harvest Time of Gift Selling . Of course , you have your toy stock ready . Now we must prepare an Occasion that will set the whole town talking ? ESPECIALLY THE CHILDREN . What wonderful salesmen the children are ! When you can make their eyes pop open with delight , and quicken their imaginations , filling them with desire for your goods , you are BOUND TO SELL THEM , for they will TALK AND TALK , and plead with their parents until they buy the things they crave . The great problem always is : how to create a store feature that will draw all the children of the city to your store , and so fill them with delight with what they have done and seen that they will forget that any other store exists . Here is my Plan : the Toy Store should be ready to open the day after Thanksgiving . Certainly not later than Tuesday , December 1st . The first day ? or better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be devoted to a Reception , or " Party , " for the 12G THE CHRISTMAS TOY STORE children of your city . They should be invited by large newspaper advertising , with striking illustrations to catch the youngsters ' eyes . The Party may be given by Santa Claus , or by a fine big Doll ? the " Queen of Christmas , " and a dozen big dolls should be on the " Reception Committee . " The Toy Section should be handsomely decorated , and all the Christmas things put out where the children can see them and get their hearts set on them . For the Reception Days , a large section of the store in , or alongside of , the Toy Department should be devoted to the Buffet Banquet Table , where real refreshments should be served to the children . This table should be attractively decorated , and on one side the dozen Dolls of the " Reception Committee " should be seated , while the other side of the table is used for a buffet service to the children , who , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( if the crowds are great ) will take their refreshments a few steps aside to eat and drink them ? bringing the cup and saucer back afterward . The Buffet Banquet Table should be arranged as follows : MANUAL OF SUCCESSFUL STOREKEEPING The refreshments should be a : small cup of chocolate , with two small cakes ( Nabisco or lady fingers ) , and two or three pieces of candy laid on the side of the saucer . This will be a complete , dainty , and perfect service , and yet the cost will be quite insignificant , and anybody can serve the children from the far side of the table . A Serving Table , somewhere at the side , can be arranged to receive the soiled cups and saucers if the crowds are too great to have them set back on the Banquet Table . In order to avoid giving more than one service to each child , tickets for refreshments may be provided and given out as each child enters the store . The idea of the " Party , " so impressively brought out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will leave an infinitely stronger effect on the mind of the children than souvenirs costing many times the price ; and the mother who would think a ten-cent souvenir too mean for the trouble of bringing her child , will be delighted with such a dainty and wholesome " treat " for her little one . The " Party " idea will prepare the minds of the little folks to carry home a pleasantly exaggerated impression of your Holiday Store , and they will not only talk about it for days at home , but they will discuss the " Party " and your store at school and at Sunday school and everywhere they go ? producing for you , at very small cost , the most valuable and lasting advertising that your Toy Store could possibly get in your city . And , of course , THEY WILL // INSIST ON HAVING THEIR CHRISTMAS PRESENTS BOUGHT AT YOUR STORE ? and their mothers will be equally grateful for your having given their darlings a delightful treat and a unique and happy day . The DIRECT result will be that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawn to the " Party , " and WILL HAVE SEEN THE TOYS and other gift things WITH THEIR OWN EYES ? and many will have brought their parents with them . And THAT is the most that you can hope for any advertising to do . The goods must do the rest ? with the help of rightly educated salespeople . All arrangements should be made EARLY in November for the " Children 's Buffet Banquet Party , " so that you will not find that the needed space has been taken , or that something needs to be done that can not be done in a hurry . If this Party is given in a fine , liberal manner , and enthusiastically advertised , your store 's reputation for the coming Christmas business will be magnificently established . But , if you are mean with your refreshments , or not tactful ill handling the children when they accept your invitation , you had better not do it at all . 129 // THE BIGGEST SALES-MAKING FACTOR OF THE CHRISTMAS SEASON In November you are adding many more people to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be clone is to EDUCATE these new people . The next important thing is to put new ginger and selling force into your regular salespeople . Do n't put new salespeople behind your counters to find their own way and pick up knowledge from their fellow clerks . Do n't risk big holiday selling and your store 's prestige by such costly oversight . Yet that is exactly what THOUSANDS of stores will do . Perhaps you think you are TOO BUSY to bother with such work now . Your Manager is head over ears moving counters and stocks . The buyers are working nights to get the Christmas goods out . NOBODY has a minute to teach salespeople anything . Such is ALWAYS the condition at this time . That is why the most vital thing that requires doing at Christmas time is rarely done . Of course , you ca n't give HOURS to this educational work ; but you can , and you MUST , give fifteen minutes EVERY DAY next week , or you may lose thousands of dollars and offend hundreds // of good customers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one third of your salespeople each morning a half hour after your people get to work . In this way you will be able to talk to your entire force TWICE during the week . Do n't attempt to teach them everything about SALESMANSHIP in twice fifteen minutes . Confine yourself to the VITAL things of the moment . Let the Superintendent or the aislemen teach your people the technical things . You must STIMULATE them , and get them in THE RIGHT ATTITUDE of mind toward their work and their customers . Impress them with their IMPORTANCE to the whole season 's success . The goods all bought , everything ready for THEM to sell . On their work depends the success or failure of the whole holiday season . Teach your people to SMILE . Do you , yourself , fully realize the CASH VALUE OF A SMILE ? Do you understand how a smile CREATES a friendly feeling even for a total stranger ? Do you realize how a customer warms up and becomes receptive to the words and suggestions of the salesperson who SMILES ? I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laugh or smirk . They are a different sort of cattle . I mean the SMILE that shows friendliness and welcome to the customer ? expressing an EAGERNESS to serve her , and a genuine PLEASURE for the opportunity to show her the merchandise in which she is interested . Some people call it a GIFT to be able to smile in this 131 N MANUAL OF SUCCESSFUL STOREKEEPING delightful manner . It is NOT a gift ? it is disposition , and its opposite , a frown , is PURE CUSSEDNESS . The smile is simply a matter of cultivation . It must be possessed by , or TAUGHT To , all salespeople who are expected to do successful work . Teach your salespeople to SMILE when approaching and serving every customer . The crosser the customer is , the more persistent should be the courtesy and the smile of the clerk . The clerk worth while Is the one who can smile when everything goes dead wrong I know how hard it is to smile sometimes . I have stood on the other side of the counter from hundreds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been licked by them ? but I was NEVER BEATEN when I could remember to SMILE . The Smile is the BUFFER that makes the sharp remarks of the grouchy customer roll off like water off a duck 's back . The Smile is the only thing that can SAVE THE SALESPERSON 'S FEELINGS . 1 t is one of the most valuable assets of the successful salesman . TEACH YOUR SALESPEOPLE TO SMILE . Then teach them ENTHUSIASM . TELL THEM EVERYTHING YOU KNOW about the excellence and attractiveness of the Christmas stocks . Have your pad written full of facts about interesting goods in your stocks , to use as illustrations of what your people have to sell to their customers . Have samples of some of the new things to hold up right there in the // meeting , and tell how they should be sold . Then tell them about your BONUS PLAN to give them an opportunity to make some EXTRA CHRISTMAS MONEY by doing extra fine selling . Take the copy that follows , and have enough cards printed to hand one to every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those that attend . They will help back up what you have said . Have several of the maxims printed in big type on large cards , and tacked up in the salespeople 's lockers and washrooms . When your people take these things to heart they will sell more goods and make people like your store more than they ever did before . BE A WINNER ! Be proud of your profession , and develop your ability in it . Do n't permit anybody to do his or her work better or more thoroughly than you do yours . Always be glad to feel that you are earning more limit you are getting , because the man most to be pitied in the world is the one who realizes that he is not earning what he is being paid . Always wear a pleasant SMILE ? it is more valuable to the successful salesperson than the most attractive apparel . Never show annoyance or indifference under any circumstances , for it destroys your professional ability and selling power . // No community is big enough for any salesperson to afford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel that you are INTERESTED in helping her to find EXACTLY THE THING SHE DESIRES and you increase your own value as a salesman while doing valuable service for your store . Establish CONFIDENCE in your earnestness and intelligence in the mind of all your customers , and impress them with the pleasure it gives you to serve them , and people who have money to spend will wear a path to your counter . And success is yours . // GETTING MONEY OUT OF CHRISTMAS CROWDS Several chapters back we talked over this matter of getting the utmost possible out of the Christmas crowds . Now you are right in the midst of the year 's greatest rush and hurry , and your daily problem is NOT how can I coax the people into my store , but HOW CAN I REAP THE FULLEST POSSIBLE HARVEST from the people that fill my store ? Part of the day ? when the crowds are thickest ? you must spend right on the firing-line . The rest of the day you must put in searching the stockroomS . GET EVERYTHING THAT CHRISTMAS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let anything hide away , to be discovered and worried about at stock-taking time . Do n't depend upon anybody else to do this . John Wanamaker , Isaac Gimbel ? all good merchants who KNOW human nature ? Go RIGHT INTO THE STOCKROOMS THEMSELVES . They spend days and nights DIGGING RIGHT INTO THE MERCHANDISE with their own hands . They have $10,000 buyers and energetic merchandise men , too , but they consider this matter TOO VITAL to trust to anybody 's eyes but their own . // They must KNOW FOR THEMSELVES that the goods are being sold . They want to have their year 's profit in MONEY ? not in stale goods that have been hidden away and not discovered until they have TO BE REDUCED TO HALF PRICE at inventory time . GET OUT YOUR GOODS ? Stack the counters up high ? give the goods a chance . Get them out from under the counters . Those FINE THINGS that you love so much that you have locked them up in a showcase , in the front of the store ? up on some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hands of your salespeople , and give them a chance to sell them . CHANGE THE SHOWCASES OFTEN . Do n't let them be burial vaults for your fine merchandise . WATCH TILE COUNTERS . Wherever you find goods holding important space ? and NOT SELLING ? move them away for better-selling goods , or CUT THE PRICES QUICK . The DEAD COUNTER is not only wasting valuable space , but it is A CANCER on your whole business . It makes people say : " Why the store is n't very busy . Maybe we 'll find better things down street . They say they 're crowded down there . " Make a QUICK SURGICAL OPERATION On that DEAD counter . I t is as much a menace to your business health and LIFE as the inflamed appendix is to your own body . GET IT OUT . PLACE A CLEVERLY WORDED CARD on every table . It is businesslike to simply mention the price , but it is far more clever to use a few words that will catch attention and stimulate desire . For instance , here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store will simply place a card on the table marked with the bare price ? $1.95 . The conventional merchant will say : " There is the Blouse , and here is the price . What more do you want ? " Well , in MY business I want a great deal more . Perhaps ? if the fact is true , as it is likely to be ? I want to say : The New Callot Blouse , $1.95 , with the fashionable elephant sleeve . I'lll get the attention of ten women where the plain price catches only one . I give them something to think about , and something to discuss with each other . Probably they never saw " The Elephant Sleeve " before . Then I 've multiplied their interest in those Blouses by ten , at least . Dignity is all right in its place ? I have a great affection for it . I try to practise it always . But Dignity that means deadness has nothing to do with the successful store . EVERY COUNTER ? EVERY DISPLAY OF MERCHANDISE ? Should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can present about the goods . And every ticket should have SELLING PUNCH to it . I ca n't tell you WHAT to put on each ticket , but I can tell you now to go about it . First : what is NEW about the goods ? Give that fact a word or two . Is there any other use than the obvious one ? State it . Is there some BIG idea back of the article ? Was it originated by some BIG DESIGNER ? If it is staple goods that everybody knows about ? tell why // it iS GOOD Or BETTER . Suggest its use in some unique way . Or put some crisp wording to brighten even its everyday use . As : Are you ready for NEW Dish Towels ? 8 cents a yard . Now do this with ALL your Christmas goods . I have used commonplace goods to show you how to do the hardest things . There is snap and inspiration in the Christmas goods that makes card writing EASY . Cover your whole store with snappy holiday suggestions , and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the READY-WRAPPED parcel idea . Nothing else helps so much , to serve people quickly , as being able to hand the article right to the customer , without waiting to wrap it up . You probably sell candy that way . Why not Books ? the ones that are in constant demand ? Have a stack on the counter  --  all wrapped up , to hand to the customer , excepting enough on top for customers to look at . The monicnt the sale is made the amount is rung up on the cash register and the bundle is handed to the customer , and the clerk is ready for the next customer , and does n't have to watch out for the package from the bundler or wrap it herself . Exactly the same thing may be done with hundreds of items all over the store . Find the things that you are selling in big quantities . Have enough for several days selling wrapped up at night to save the busy daylight hours for work that MUST be done at the time . A lot of people will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have to wait to have them wrapped . Everywhere that you have a counter filled with one particular article have an abundant quantity of them READY WRAPPED to save time . Six sales can often be made in the time it would otherwise take for one . And QUICK SELLING is the secret of getting money out of crowds . Hundreds slip by if the article is not ready to hand directly to the purchaser . Eliminate the tedious check writing for these quick-selling articles . Use a cash register if you have it . If not , PICK OUT YOUR HONEST PEOPLE ? YOU have plenty , of COURSE ? AND TRUST THEM . You 'll lose less by dishonesty by trusted salespeople than you 'll lose by slow selling . The big stores have proved this fact . And more and more they are simplifying the check-writing process , or supplying check writers to help the salespeople and give them their whole time for selling ? so that slightly interested customers do not slip away . EFFICIENCY requires the cutting of red tape ? shortening processes . Nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wait while a salesperson is tediously writing out a voluminous sales slip . And EVERYBODY is in a hurry just before Christmas . MAKE ALL THE SHORT CUTS YOU CAN to turn over the goods to the customer QUICKLY , and take the money without fuss and red tape . CALL A FIVE-MINUTE MEETING OF YOUR PEOPLE  - -  preferably in the morning ? just after the store // opens . Give them an inspiring talk on the necessity of quick work for the next two weeks . Ask them to tell you how you can help them to make short cuts . They know what takes the time ? what is tedious about selling and getting goods into the hands of the customers . GET THEIR ADVICE . Of course , you ca n't follow it all , but you 'll find a lot of it quite valuable . Encourage them . Enthuse them , and they 'll go at the day 's business just like a football team goes into the game . It is awfully hard for salespeople who have been working hard day after day , and perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and enthusiasm every day . But you can help them mightily ? you can fill them full of your own enthusiasm ? by a personal word or talk . Do IT . // MAKING FRIENDS WITH NEWLY-WEDS One of the most important factors in building up a retail business is the securing of new customers among newly married couples . In every case there is a new home to furnish , and the store where the goods are purchased for the first home is usually the place that retains the patronage of these people as long as the store deserves it . For this reason the shrewd merchant will plan a continuous campaign to win newly married people as his customers . The important thing is to have a thoroughly good method , and then to have a system organized by which each marriage notice will be followed up with a watchful eye every day of the year as long as the store is in business . Of course , a lot of valuable work can be done previous to the wedding day , after engagements are announced , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the marriage ceremony . In cities where newspapers publish all the marriage notices it is very easy to secure the names of the newly married people every morning . In smaller cities and towns , where the names may be published only 141 . N MANUAL OF SUCCESSFUL STOREKEEPING once or twice a week , it is easy to find some other means of securing the names ; sometimes it may be by making arrangements with each of the clergymen and aldermen in the town or city . Of course , this plan would cause you to miss the names of any couples who were married outside of that city and come back there to reside ; but the newspaper columns , either in the regular marriage notices or in the local news , will keep you well informed and provide a very complete list . I t should be made the duty of one individual to watch for this list , and one person can very easily take care of this matter in connection with his or her other duties . Immediately , when the name is secured , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services of the store should be tendered to the newly married couple . At the end of this chapter is my suggestion of exactly how this letter should be worded , and it might be used as a form letter for a long time , but should be changed before the children of the married people grow up ! A card list of the names of married people with the dates of their weddings should be very faithfully kept , and other letters should be mailed to this list from time to time , suggesting the new things that may be required in the home at that particular season . Of course , in addition , any printed matter of any sort that you get out should be mailed to this list . It also would become a very valuable list from which // to mail letters to the man of the family a month before the wedding anniversary , suggesting to him the fact that his wedding anniversary is approaching and he is perhaps thinking of some appropriate gift for his wife . Then you can make suggestions , also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the home as well as things for her individual use . Such letters will show that you are interested in the home and are watching anniversaries , and there is a subtle compliment about this very thoughtfulness . Of course , the death notices must also be carefully watched and notations made on your list so that it is always properly kept up , and no inappropriate letters are mailed after a death . In addition to the list of Newly-Weds there should be a list of Birthdays ? whenever a birth notice appears the name and date should be put on a card index , the names of the mother and father , and the name of the child , so that letters may be written preceding the birthday anniversary , of course using such a mailing list to interest the parents in children 's apparel from the first moment of birth on through the years as long as the list is maintained . Always suggest apparel or other articles suited to the age of the child . No more valuable advertising work can be done than what goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enables you to write more direct letters , keeping you in close personal touch with valuable customers all over your town or city . I have never 143 4 , MANUAL OF SUCCESSFUL STOREKEEPING found a woman who did not appreciate the compliment of having a store notice the birthdays and anniversaries of the family . Everybody appreciates the fact that his or her patronage is considered of sufficient value to be solicited in this personal and thoughtful way . It also indicates a wide-awake policy in the store that does things in this manner , and this sort of efficiency in soliciting patronage indicates carefulness and thoughtfulness in serving customers in a manner to keep their trade . It is a valuable part of a thoroughly good retail store 's policy , but some stores attempting this policy carry it out so badly , and with such a lack of tact in the way let ters are written , that it sometimes does more harm than good . Letters should always be dictated by a person who can write an interesting and tactful letter . ? A bookkeeper can very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and others can not . The merchant , or the general manager , should take pains to discover a bright man or woman somewhere in the store who could undertake to do this work in a manner that would win a multitude of friends . Every store has at least several such people in its organization if they are hunted out . Of all the advertising that goes out of the store nothing is of quite as much importance as the personal letter on the store 's stationery , signed with the individual name of a member of the firm , the general manager , or of some popular salesman or saleswoman. // Even in the rush of New York City business there are few customers of the big stores who do not try to be waited on by a salesperson who knows them by name , and whose name the customer also knows . I consider it most valuable for a store to cater to this building up of customers ' acquaintance by their salespeople because there is no more powerful factor in making a woman decide to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a competent , tactful salesperson in that particular department of your store . If such a salesperson personally writes a letter about new merchandise that has been received , or about special bargains that are to be offered , the customer is most powerfully drawn to the store .

Faithfully yours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . // THE MONTH-END SALE The " Red Letter Days , " which I inaugurated at Wanamaker 's , and the " Month-End Sale , " which carried out the same idea , at Gimbel 's , are features of great value which I believe should be installed as the policy of every aggressive store . There are two chief reasons : 1 . The last two days of the month are always likely to be poor business days in any store , and especially so in a store that has charge accounts , and the good Storekeeper will want to inaugurate some policy that will build up a good business on those otherwise dull days . 2 . The well-merchandised store should have its slow-selling goods , cleaned out promptly at the end of every month . This prevents dangerous and undesirable accumulations of poor-selling stock , and it also provides material for BARGAINS which tempt and tickle the bargain seekers while giving you hack practically all the money invested in the bad stock at the same time . The " Red Letter Days " at Wanamaker 's brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because even in the Panic of 1907 they brought in a tremendous amount of CASH , which was needed at that time when charge customers were asking for extended time . The " Month-End Sales " at Gimbel 's not only assured the store of good business for the last two days of every month , but they provided a time and a good excuse for cutting prices on goods that were not selling well , and they gave splendid opportunity to get rid of odd lots and remnants . They kept the stocks cleaned up better , made a mighty good reinforcement to the month 's volume of sales just when wanted , and brought in cash for disbursement on the first of the next month . I do not know of any single feature of merchandising that contributes so much to good healthy storekeeping as this Month-End Sale feature . Of course , it must be done intelligently and HONESTLY . One half-hearted effort ? one attempt to fool the people into believing that mere words are all you have to offer will kill the success of the movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honestly merchandised and offering genuine bargains . It must also be broad enough in its scope and variety of goods to interest and attract a very large and diverse constituency . A great many stores fail of full success because they draw back at the very point where they might establish a valuable reputation for this store feature . Strawbridge &; Clothier , Philadelphia , have made the 148 ? THE MONTH-END SALE " Clover Sale " famous . Whenever it is announced the store is sure to be packed with enthusiastic people . Of course , they plan for this monthly event in a very large way . They buy special merchandise on which they make full percentage of profit , and this is what your " Month-End Sale " may develop into . But , no matter how popular it grows , or what you may purchase to place on sale at that time , you should never abandon the opportunity it provides to get rid of all your slow stock and your odds and ends . For this riddance is most vital to prevent your capital being tied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even if a sacrifice has to be made once in a while . Far better to get even HALF of your money out of bad stock , and get the money at work , than to keep it tied up for a year or more , with the loss growing greater all the time , and the bad goods doing you actual damage every time they are shown . Undesirable goods at full prices do you DAMAGE all the time . But these same goods , WHEN REDUCED , will make friends and prestige for you . And the money goes to work again . Is n't it a wonder that so many merchants ca n't see this ? Can you understand why they fail to do the heroic thing when they have everything to gain by doing it , and EVERYTHING TO LOSE by NOT doing it ? And yet how few are doing it ? And the vital question is : " What , are you doing about it ? " // It is a fine plan to begin the Month-End policy with a big YEAR-END Sale , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the time that business drops off with such a crash that something mighty drastic has to be done to stimulate the jaded shopper who has been rushed to death every minute during the strenuous month of December . The real bargain impulse is the only thing that will work , and even the bargain must have a NEW NAME . This novelty is supplied by the " Year-End Sale , " which must be exploited as though you had never offered a bargain before in your store history . After all , THAT is one of the greatest secrets of successful Advertising . Each new offering must be presented as the Sunrise of a New World . The clever advertiser never remembers what he has done before , and he makes the public forget the past and become enthused and often really excited over the new feature that perhaps is merely presenting GOOD merchandise in a different manner , and with the use of different word 's . By this I am suggesting nothing that is deceptive . It is simply catering to human nature 's demand for originality of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being equal , the store with " ideas " will win out always over its more conservative rival . People know far less about real values than they are credited with knowing . You must keep on showing your goods and presenting your case in the strongest possible manner , or the people will either not know what you have or they will forget . 150
