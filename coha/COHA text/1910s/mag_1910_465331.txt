A FEW decades ago we heard much of the new science of experimental psychology . The " new psychology , " as it was called , flourished vigor ously and supplanted its rival , the older , speculative or metaphysical type . In its infancy this science had as its province the experimental analysis of the human mind . As time went on it became evident that the human mind , like the human body , had passed through developmental stages before reaching its present relatively high stage of perfection . If this is true ? and there can no longer be a doubt of it ? it becomes as necessary to study the minds of animals as it is to study the human mind . This new branch of experimental psychology is called animal psychology or animal behavior , The latter term is probably the preferable one , since many biologists are studying the behavior of animals , and some of them , being ignorant of the aims and methods of experimental psychology , object to any naming of the field which would imply that its workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough , however , for both the psychologist and the biologist . The goal of both is the same ? the right understanding of all the factors which enter into the development of human life . Not later than ten years ago our knowledge of the behavior of animals consisted largely of the chance observations made by naturalists and of the anecdotes which the lovers of animals had recorded about their own pets or the pets of their neighbors . The status of animal psychology at that time was similar to that of physics when the latter science concerned itself with the question as to whether the sun revolved daily around the earth . The older naturalists , by the mistaken way in which they carried on their observations , gave us what has aptly been called a supranormal psychology of ani mals . If a cat , which has been shut up in a room while its mistress is away , goes to the window and turns a button , thereby permitting the window to swing open , what more natural on the part of the mistress when she returns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exit than to assume that the cat understood the relation existing between the button and the window and reasoned that if it turned the button the window would swing open ? And when this anecdote comes to the ear of the naturalist , why does he not have the right to generalize upon this single incident And conclude that " reasoning " is a part of the cat 's mental equipment ? Or , if the squirrel during the time of plenty buries a store of nuts , and when the time of scarcity comes goes and scratches them up , why not assume that the squirrel " remembers " that he buried the nuts in such and such places , and realizes that if he goes to these spots he can again find food ? Again , if one of these naturalists were asked whether or not animals have color vision , the reply would be : " Certainly . Is not the bull angered by the flaunting of a red rag ? Does not the female bird select her mate by reason of his attractive plumage ? Why else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their gaudy plumage in the mating season ? " Gradually , in the course of time , after a sufficient number of such observations were at hand , there appeared numerous hooks , which took as their subject-matter the mental life of animals . Animals high and low in the zoological scale were accredited with all the sensations which man possesses , and with many which man does not possess . It was affirmed in these books that animals consciously remember their past acts ; that they have emotions similar in most respects to those displayed by man . It was even affirmed that the sentiments of justice , chalky , religion , and other social virtues are not wholly wanting . These books are of no value to the science . They consist simply of tabulations of clever acts , which , if performed by man , would presumably call for the exercise of conscious processes . It is impossible to find in these publications a single carefully conducted experimental test of the acts in question . As fit companions to this type of books , we have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the literary naturalists exist even at the present time . These men spend a day or two in the woods watching the animals at work and at play . They may or may not make written notes of the results of their observations , but when it comes time to write up the story their mental notes are rounded into beautiful literary form . If there arises a conflict between the fact observed and what the author really wants to say , so much the worse for the fact . It is easy now to point out the mistake which the early naturalists made and which the untrained man makes today in observing the behaVior of animals . In our example the cat probably did turn the button , but this part of the observation is not the whole story ? by what tedious and long-drawn-out process did the animal first stumble upon the right movement ? To complete the observation , it would be necessary to take a number of such animals , put them in the same situation , and observe the whole process of learning the net @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to experiment . It was the recognition of the need of experiment which led Principal Lloyd Morgan of Bristol College , England , to separate himself some twenty years ago from the " anecdotal " school and begin an experimental investigation of the behavior of higher animals . Time and laboratory facilities were not at his disposal , but he made many tests upon chicks and upon his pet dog , which usually accompanied him on his morning walks . Morgan 's work did not attract many followers until some ten years ago , when Thorndike of Columbia University took up the study in the United States . Since then many other American and Continental students have begun studies upon animals , and to-day , in this country at least , the field of animal behavior is one of the most active in the whole of science . The work is now no longer confined to the study of higher vertebrates . It has been extended until it includes the study of all living organisms . How do we make a laboratory study of the mind of an animal ? It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for ourselves the drama of mental events which is taking place there , consequently how is it ever possible to get any clear insight into the working of its mind ? At first sight we seem to have here an insuperable obstacle to the study . A little reflection , however , will show that we are forever debarred from studying the mind of our human neighbor in this direct way ; yet surely no one in this day would be hardy enough to deny that we can and do get a very definite and scientific notion of the way our neighbor 's mind works . We study our human subject in two ways ? by watching what he does under given and controllable conditions , and by attending to what be says under those conditions . Still further reflection will show that speech is only R refined and highly organized way of acting or behaving . Instead of reacting with the arm or leg our human subject when speaking reacts with the muscles of his throat . If it is admitted that speech is only a refined mode of behavior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are forced to the conclusion that all of our knowledge of the minds of others comes from our observation of what they do . If we control the conditions under which a human subject reacts , and record such reactions , as is done in the psychological laboratory , we get that body of knowledge which is called " human , experimental psychology . " In a similar way we take our animal subjects into the laboratory , preferably when they are young ( very often at birth ) , and watch the gradual way in which their instinctive life develops . This gives us a key to what all animals of a particular species naturally and instinctively do ? i. e. , the acts which they perform without training , tuition , or social contact with their fellow animals . It teaches the psychologist , too , the way to go about the animal 's education-i. e. , gives him a notion of the problems which the structural peculiarities of the animal will permit him to learn . He would not give a starfish the same problems that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lowest form of animal life ) the same problems as the monkey But it is very desirable before the detailed work of any animal 's education is begun to know something about the way his sense organs work . We must know the avenues through which we may appeal to him . Is our animal normal iu his color vision ? If not , what are the defects ? Is be totally calor-blind , or only partly so ? How keen is his ability to discriminate between two equally illuminated circles when they differ only in size ? Can he discriminate between a circle and a square , a square and a triangle , or between a circle and an ellipse ? Is he more sensitive to differences in the intensity of white light than a human being , or less so ? It sometimes takes months or even years for an investigator to answer accurately a single one of these questions ; yet every sense organ ? smell , hearing , touch , etc. ? should be tested in this careful way before it can be said that we know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How can we answer the question , for example , whether an animal has color vision ? I have already said , " by watching what he does . " Let me illustrate , from some of my own experiments upon the color vision of monkeys , how the psychologist makes the animal tell whether it has color vision or not . Two colors ( obtained by passing sunlight through a prism ) , red and green , or yellow and blue , are made to illuminate two small metal food-boxes , set flush with the floor of the apparatus , the whole being placed in an otherwise dark room . In the food-box ( closed by a hinged lid which the animal must pull open ) illuminated by the red we place a single grape ; in the box illuminated by the green we also place a grape , but arrange the conditions so that the animal can open only the box illuminated by the red light . The grape is kept in the other box so that we may he sure that the animal is not being guided by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room to get food by pulling open these little boxes . What happens when we take him into the dark room and confront him with the two boxes illuminated by the two different lights ? Obviously he can choose either of the two boxes ; lie does not know which one to open , no association has as yet been established between red light and food and green light and no food . As a matter of fact , he is just as likely to go to one as to the other ? i. e. , make as many wrong choices as right . H we leave the red color on the same side always , the animal will learn to go to that side even though it is color-blind , by merely forming the habit of going always to the right or left a so-called position habit . We must guard against this by having our apparatus so arranged that we can present the red now on the right , now on the left . The animal must learn to follow the red light regardless of its position . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ established between red color and food . It required about twenty-five days for Jimmie , a rhesus monkey of mine , to form this simple association . At the end of this time he would choose the red ( color with food ) about ninety times out of a hundred on the average . It began to look as though be might have color vision , but our test had not been carried far enough . So far we have said nothing about the difference in the brightness or intensity of the two colors . We know that colors as they are seen in the sunlight spectrum differ to our eyes quite . a little in their brightness . A color-blind person could learn to distinguish between red a n d green in the above test by reason of the fact that they differ so in brightness . The apparatus must be so constructed that we can easily and immediately change the brightness of either the red or the green , and the monkey must be able to choose the red always if he has color vision , under these several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red very dark , green very bright ; both red and green dark ; both red and green bright . Many such changes were introduced into my tests in order to confuse the monkey if possible , but without much success . The monkey apparently possesses to a very high degree the ability to choose between colors . Only a few of the animals have been tested in this careful way . When the results are all in , we will know as much about the animal typo of vision as we do about the vision of a human being . The results , so far attained , seem to indicate that monkeys have color vision . The common cat is apparently defective or wholly lacking in it . Opinion is divided about dogs ? the evidence seems fair , however , that the Russian hunting-dog is without it . The dancing mice ( tests made by Professor Yerkes of Harvard ) and white rats are very defective in color vision . We know very little about the color vision of birds , but there is some evidence that they possess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen that when we have carefully studied the color vision in all the main types of animals , we will have a set of facts giving us the complete evolutionary history of color vision . That human color vision has h a d such an evolutionary history comes out very clearly from the fact that studies on the human cup-shaped retina ( the sensitive coat or lining of the eye ) have shown it to be almost if not totally color-blind upon the . periphery ; sensitive only to yellow and blue in the middle region , and sensitive to all the colors of the rainbow only in a very small region near ? its gbometric centre . When we consider this atavistic condition of our own retina the need of such studies upon the color vision of animals is fully apparent . The students of behavior are as busily engaged in testing the other senses of animals as in testing vision . The dog has been shown to have a wonderful power of analyzing musical chords and of detecting very slight differences in pitch . Other animals have been shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developed animals seem to be almost , if not wholly , lacking in hearing . Apparatus and methods are at hand for forcing the animal to tell us about the kind of world he lives in . If it is a smell world , we shall find it out . If it is a world of vision in which there are no colors , we shall not long remain ignorant . When all such evidence is in , we shall have an invaluable body of facts which will all but revolutionize the present popular way of looking upon mind as the proud possession of the human race . Having found by our previous studies what sense organs of our animal may be appealed to , our next step is to find out how he learns . Learning is the great problem in all human psychology , and any facts we can gather about the way the animal learns will be helpful to us . We can find such facts only by resorting to experiment . We choose some problem for the animal to solve : Ile must raise a latch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thread a maze , before the goal is reached-s. e. , before food can be obtained . The animal , like the human being in this respect , will work at a problem only so long as it compels his interest . We must keep his interest by providing a stimulus , This stimulus may be food , escape fromand over the box , gnawing the wires , pushing . into every mesh of the wire with its nose , clawing , etc . This random instinetive exercise of energy results early in the knowledge of the fact that the door of the box is tho only movable portion . The rat 's activity becomes centred here . Since the latch is attached to the small door , the chance has rapidly become better that some movement of the rat , such as butting or clawing , may raise the latch from the socket . In a period of time , which may vary from two minutes to twenty . or even longer , this happy accident will occur , the door will then fall open , and the rat get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run immediately to the latch and raise it ? I have hundreds of records , not only upon the rat , but upon other animals as well , which show that ecmfinernent , punishment for wrong action , etc . So long as we keep t he stinmius constant , the animal will work steadily at the task from day to day . By such experiments we have established the fact that when animals learn to open doors , run mazes , etc. , by their own unaided efforts , they achieve the first success in nearly all cases by some happy accident . If a rat is hungry and is confined in a large cage . with a small box containing food which it can get access to only by raising a latch , it begins its task by the display of a repertoire of instinctive acts , common to every member of the rat race . It runs around CXX.  - -  No. 717. - 44 l i t e r ? DR . YOAKUM 'S TEMPERATURE APPARATUS The tunnels , A and A are surrounded by water-jackets so that the temperature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will . Food is placed in the warmer tunnel , and the animal following the arrow most turn either to the right or to the left according to the position of the warmer tunnel which by previous trials he has found contains food such is not the case . The individual animal may take longer on the second trial than upon the first , but the average of the second trial of a number of animals will be shorter than the average of the first . On successive trials the time of success gets shorter and shorter , until finally the animal will open the latch as soon as confronted with the box . This is the type of hundreds of similar experiments which have been made upon animals ranging in development from the monkey to the mouse . Most of the munerous acts of the trained animals on the vaudeville stage are acquired in this laborious way ( as the trainer well knows , would he but confess it ) . Such a. mode of learning is the rule , and any higher method ( so called " reasoning " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it exists . The question immediately arises , Can not the animal be aided in its learning ? Can not instruction be given by the experimenter , or by another trained animal ? Students of animal behavior are more or less unsettled in their minds about this question . Thorndike was not able to impart instruction to his monkeys , dogs , and cats . They were likewise unable to profit by watching a trained animal perform the act . or by being " put through " the act ? i. e. , by having the experimenter make their limbs go through the act . My experiments upon monkeys agree with those of Thorndike . I was not able to get them to imitate such simple acts as lifting a latch , pushing a banana from a large glass cylinder by means of a large , light , stick , or dragging in grapes beyond their reach by MUMS of a light wooden rake . In the Harvard psychological laboratory results confirmative of imitation in animals have been obtained . Berry has found that the white rat . has some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is somewhat better equipped in this respect . Latterly , Haggerty , whose article appeared in a recent number of The Century , finds a fairly well advanced stage of imitation in monkeys . It is unfortunate in one sense that this conflict of evidence exists . Fortunate in another , in that interest has been so aroused that more work will be undertaken upon the problem . This much has been unquestionably established : Animals do not possess the function of imitating in anything like the degree which they were formerly supposed to . The function is certainly rudimentary . The fact that animals learn by such a " trial-and-error method " as that just described for the rat duet not mean that its methods are far different from those of a small child . Nearly all of the early co-ordination of infants , from the proper manipulation of the milk - bottle onward , are formed in this laborious way . Imitation appears as an actual new method of learning only after the proper control of the various separate muscles of the arms and legs has been learned by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tenth month ; it develops slowly , reaches its maximum in the third and fourth years , when the elementary social habits , language , personal , etc. , are forming , and then declines . Reasoning in the older use of the term appears much later . It is a very much overrated psychological process , even in adults . The amount of actual reasoning going on in the minds of most of us , after the pattern of the old conventional type All men are mortal ; Socrates was a man ; Therefore , Socrates was mortal ? is just about nil . What we do is to - Past connections and associations will appear in the mind when we are i II a situation which demands some action . If the situation is wholly new , no proper action will take place . It is only when our memory can supply the separate steps in the act demanded by the present difficult situation that we find the proper ( and new ) combination springing at first haltingly and then boldly into our mind . We can reason about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not play the Spring Scng until we have learned to control each separate movement by the slow and very same process that the animal employs . The point that I would make in all this is that there is no royal road to habit and knowledge . Man gets his first steps in exactly the same way as does the animal . Studies in animal behavior , while not fulfilling the hopes of the early students of evolution in showing that animals have exalted types of intellect , nevertheless are forcing us to reconsider our extravagant notions of the all-sufficiency of the human mind . Continuity between the mind of man and brute , the idea of the early students , will still be shown to exist , not by exalting the mind of the brute , but rather by the reverse process of showing the defects in the human mind . It is a far cry from such theoretical questions ? questions , however , which always have interested the human race and always will ? to that of the practical value of animal psychology . It is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ import to the study . At present the routine of studies in the secondary schools , high schools , and even in the colleges , is based upon custom and tradition and not upon experimental studies which show its fitness . If the question were asked why we have four fifty-minute periods each day , each devoted to one topic ? for example , to algebra , literature , Latin , physiography , respectively -- there would be no answer , unless it were that it is customary . No explanation could be vouchsafed as regards the time allotted to each subject , nor as to why these specific subjects were chosen . Experimental studies may sometime show that quite a different routine is desirable . Certain types of study may be found to be antagonistic , certain others mutually supplementary . Educational systems dealing with that most precious article , the human child , are necessarily conservative , and are slow to introduce changes and to have resort to experiment . Fortunately , there is no such sentiment in regard to the courses of study prescribed for animals . We may vary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desired that our animals learn five problems in the shortest time ; do we get our best results by forcing them to work intensively upon one problem at a time , then , when it is learned , by putting them to work upon another , and so on until all five are learned ; or shall they be allowed to work at regular intervals on all five each day until all are learned ' ? Which is the more economical as regards time , and which method fixes the problem more firmly in memory ? Or again , if the animal has to learn one problem at a time , shall he work upon it once each day for sixty days ( assuming that he can learn it perfectly in sixty trials ) , or four times each day in rapid succession for fifteen days ; does he learn it better by doing it a larger number of times each day for a shorter number of days , or by the other method ? Which method enables the animal to retain ( " remember " ) the act better ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be answered by actually carrying out the experiment . That the reply the animal psychologist returns to such and similar questions has an intimate bearing upon instruction in schools can readily be seen . The ability to cope with such problems gives to the study of animal behavior its practical raison d'etre.
