txt Col. Theodore Roosevelt is being urged to take President Taft and his Administration for his text when he speaks at the State Fair in Syracuse on Saturday . There was every reason to believe , one of those who are urging the Colonel said yesterday , that he would comply ; that he would deal with this subject at length . and that he would make his attitude toward President Taft and his policies very clear . If he does , the speech at Syracuse on Saturday is likely to be one of the most interesting and important utterances of Col. Roosevelt , since his return from Africa , and friends and political foes alike will look forward to the occasion with the keenest curiosity . The news reached Republican State Headquarters , where the Old Guard leaders held forth yesterday afternoon . Soon afterward it was learned that Republican State Chairman Timothy L. Woodruff. who is booked for a speech at a complimentary dinner to be given to him by the officials of the State Fair to-morrow night , would stay . over in Syracuse to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit on the lid here while Chairman Woodruff is away . The Old Guard leaders are looking forward to the Syracuse speech with thrills of happy anticipation . The stern features of Mr. Barnes relaxed in a joyful smile when the news reached headquarters . Chairman Woodruff chuckled. -N National Committeeman Ward of Westchester winked his eye . Col. " Lafe " Gleason whistled softly , and the tune was " Every little movement has a meaning of its own . " From the very beginning of the fight the Old Guard leaders have realized that the impression so forcibly conveyed by President Taft in his letter to Lloyd C. Griscom , President of the Republican County Committee , that he frowned on the Old Guard programme and that the programme of the Roosevelt forces in this State had his approval was a mighty obstacle in the way of an Old Guard victory . Now they believe that if the Colonel follows the advice of his friends and speaks out he will forfeit the good will and support of President Taft in the carrying out of his plans . Those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the Taft Administration in advance of the State convention have done so to take the wind out of the opposition 's sails . The statement made on Tuesday night by William Barnes . Jr. , of Albany as leader of the Old Guard forces , left no doubt but that this issue would be forced on the Colonel at the convention . This new line of attack on the Colonel had been planned by the Old Guard leaders shrewdly and with the burning of much midnight oil . It will place the Colonel between the devil and the deep sea , they argue . They plan insisting on the insertion of a plank in the Republican State platform indorsing the Taft administration in its every detail and proposing the renomination of President Taft in 1912 . Should Col. Roosevelt give his . assent , and they do n't care whether hp does or not , they argue that it is difficult to tee how he Ca n square himself with his insurgent following in the Middle West . Should he oppose the plan it will give the anti-Roosevelt leaders an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Taft . This , they believe , will alienate every Federal office holder who comes to the convention with a delegation and make control of the convention by the Roosevelt forces impossible . It has been plain from the beginning of The Roosevelt-Old Guard conflict that only with the 1 support of President Taft for this Rousevelt programme in this State can the Roosevelt forces win . It was very apparent yesterday that the anti-Roosevelt leaders felt they had a winning hand and that , to use the recent expression of one of these leaders . " the cards were stacked " against the Colonel and his friends . - " ix ' ' , 1 have neon in polities for half a lifetime , most of us. " said one of the Old Guard leaders yesterday . " and if we I could n't play the bunch of amateurs that are managing the Colonel 's campaign clear off the board , we wouid't be much use to ourselves or anybody else . " It is very.evident that not a single trick is being overlooked by Mr. Barnes and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confidence yesterday . It is asserted now by those who are managing the anti-Roosevelt campaign that nothing can prevent them from having a majority of the delegates in the State Convention . The claim put forth yesterday was 51.5 delegates , seven more than a majority . " We are not giving our hand away , and are not prepared to state ' where our support will come from , but for the bone- I fit of Brother Griscom we 'll let it be known that at least twenty-five members ' of his own delegation will vote with us bosses at Saratoga. - said one of the anti-Roosevelt lcaders . Much of tilt ! confidence at Republican State headquarters is due to a feeling that Col. Roosevelt 's utleranc.s during his Western trip have turned against him many Republican business men among the delegates elected prior to the RooseveltOld Guard fight , who under ordinary circumstances would be arrayed against the bosses . The speeches in the Middle ' 1 est. it is apparent from the talk of the anti-Roosevelt leaders , are relied upon by them as their strongest weapon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shown Roosevelt leanings they use this argument : Suppose Col. Roosevelt and his friends should control this convention ; it would only be a question of two , or at most four . years before the Republican organization would be compelled to return to conservatism , and then where will you be if you tie up to the Roosevelt bunch of amateurs now ? They declare that this argument is proving effective . President Griscom of the Republican County Committee said yesterday that he did not expect to have another conference with Col. Roosevelt before to-morrow , when the Colonel will come to town on his way to Syracuse . Mr. Griscom is still confident that , with the ezrception of the delegation of Col. Abraham Gruber of the Seventeenth Assembly District , all the delegates from New York County will vote for Roosevelt for Temporary Chairman of the Republican State Convention . Estimates on the comparative strength of Vice President Sherman and Col. Roosevelt , crediting the former with twenty delegates from New York County , 109 in Kings . the twenty-four delegates from Queens , and the eight from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 307 of the delegates already selected , 508 being a majority . Broome , Cayuga , Chemung , Erie , Lewis , Nassau , Orange , Rensselaer , Schuyler , Suffolk , and Tompkins , where the delegates have not 1 yet been elected , are claimed by the pro , gressives and practically conceded by the other side . Giving the Old Guard the benefit of all doubtful counties would place the Roosevelt strength at 470 delegates . But in many of these the progressives are claiming the whole or part of the delegation . ! In Queens , for instance , the Fourth As , sembly District is claimed by the Roose , velt forces , and it is intimated that the 1 thirty-three delegates from Kings , con : ceded to the progressives by the anti-Roosevelt leaders , is not by any means ' all the Roosevelt strength in Chairman Wroodruff 's bailiwick . The delegates in Kings will be selected to-night and interesting developments are looked for in some districts .                 @ @ @ @
