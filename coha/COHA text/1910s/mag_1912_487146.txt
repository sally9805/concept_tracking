Is Mr. Wells headed straight for re -- action ? That is a question which will have to be answered in definite form by the future biographer of Mr. Wells when he deals with the latest book by the most modern of contemporary English novelists . A definite answer at the present time is hazardous . A writer of - the modern temperament changes rather than evolves Consistency being a rather outworn virtue , it does not follow that a man 's opinions to-morrow must be in harmony with his opinions - of to-day . But whether " Marriage " is a spiritual conversion or merely a spiritual caprice , it may be set down at once that in this book Mr. Wells has written an old-fashioned novel . It does not matter that our author insists - upon describing his problem as a modern problem and , his characters as modern men and women . In spite of fre quent allusions to Albert Hall meetings , Mr. Asquith 's troubles with the suffragists , and other actualities of the morning newspaper , the story harks back in its essentials to a literary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obsolete . When Mr. Wells 's Marjorie lets her thoughts drift back , in curious archanlogical speculation , to the dim , dead past when Russians and Japanese were battling in Manchuria  --  almost seven years ago  --  she is at one with the modern young lady in Punch who can not abide Bernard Shaw because he is so " Edwardian . " But this is just mannerism . The story of Marjorie Pope 's love and marriage is old-fashioned in theme , outlook , and treatnient . If Mr. Wells , as a student of social phenomena , stands for anything in the public mind , it is for the thorough reconstruction of this lumbering , creaking , utterly irrational world of ours into a neatly-mortised , water-tight , and strictly hygienic place to live in . In ' Marriage " he pokes fun at the world-builders . The scientific reason was to make a clean rsweep of old habits and prejudices . To-day Mr Wells 's attitude is much more charitable . He does not say it in so many words , but it is plain that old habits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He has almost attained that conservative temperament which respects facts and institutions whose roots lie deep down in time . Formerly , Mr. Wells used to be very impatient with the devil of inertia . In the present book he is exceedingly impatient with the kind of people that are always inaugurating Movements and Programmes . He loses his temper utterly when he speaks of the Gawdsakers , the people who jump up and scream " For Gawd 's sake , let 's do something ! " without thinking things out . It is quite evident that Mr. Wells is not one of the moderns who regard themselves as points pressing forward into apace . When he insists upon stopping and finding out where and how far he is going , Mr. Wells reveals a state of mind that is almost Victorian . This is a cruel thing to say , but the truth must be told . Marjorie Pope , in " Marriage , " is a clear-eyed , clean-limbed , healthy , intelligent modern young woman . We call Marjorie a modern young woman because that is what Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precisely that of any girl in any century who stands wondering on the threshold of the unknown . She likes pretty clothes and slim-built young men , entertains vague notions on religion , detests her father 's boorish manners , and dreams of a lover . He comes in the person of a brilliant young chemist who tumbles out of a monoplane on Marjorie 's lawn . They elope , marry , and rent a small house in Chelsea which Marjorie furnishes in exquisite taste and complete disregard of the size of Trafford 's income . They are happy . Children come . Trafford must give up his researches in the chemistry of molecules and go in for popular lectures , but the money difficulty persists . Trafford gives up lecturing before suburban women 's clubs and goes in for synthetic rubber . He grows rich and his life grows empty . Marjorie ' life is empty , too . She takes a larger and more expensive house and then a still larger and still more expensive house , and the larger the house the wider is the space between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corner in which Marjorie sits unhappy ; until Trafford can bear it no longer . What tortures him is that in London there is no opportunity for thinking things out and talking things over . He decides to go to Labrador  --  alone , if necessary ; but Marjorie goes with him . Then , , through several months of northern twilight , Trafford thinks and talks ; and the conclusion at which he arrives is this : Husband and wife must be comrades ; but since the male is the pioneer of the race , in the work of civilization , he must not let himself be hampered by the female 's natural appetite for beauty ( including fine clothes and excitement ) . They come back to London and their children , Trafford to perfect his message and bring it before the world , Marjorie to help him with her sympathy instead of giving dinners and running up bills . Whether they put their plans into effect Mr. Wells does not tell us . Probably they do not . The mere fact that Mr. Wells has written a novel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficiently interesting in itself , would not necessarily call for extended comment . As we have said , there is no safe predicting which way Mr. Wells will face in his next book . - We may find him still further on the road towards the old standards and the old moralities , or we may find him holding an advanced outpost far ahead of " Ann Veronica . " What does arrest , one 's attention in " Marriage , " is that in breaking away from the modern conception of marriage and love in marriage , Mr. Wells remains faithful to certain characteristic dogmas of modern writers on the subject . He has kept the old turns of phrase . The book in its total effect is old-fashioned , but it has pages that are very advanced indeed . Thus we know that whereas the conservative mind prefers to regard the ideal marriage as a condition of peaceful beatitude , the modern mind is obsessed with the curse of placidity that follows upon marriage . Here Mr. Wells is quite modern still . He deplores the fading of romance that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the first golden days of wedlock . The burden of his song is familiar enough : With marriage the emotional climax is attained ; soon the walls of the enchanted garden fall to the ground ? and the real world outside forces its way in . At all times men have recognized the emotional calm that follows courtship , when Romeo forswears moonlit balconies and warms his slippers at the fire . Women have revolted at the fact . Men have accepted it with resignation . Recall Sardou 's Cyprienne , and how she protests against the stagnation of married life . Des Prunelles asks whether she would have him dress up as a Calabrian bandit and climb in at her window on a rope ladder . And no one would accuse Sardou of being modern . But whereas the old world , accepting the fact that men are April when they woo and December when they wed , has attempted to go behind the fact and work out a reconciliation between the real and the ideal , the modern temperament refuses to be comforted . And so in countless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage to the never-failing stimulant of art . Your extreme modernist does not hesitate to return a verdict of guilty on the indictment . Marriage ceases to be true marriage when romance ceases ; accordingily , it stands condemned . And now note one of those essential contradictions that the modern soul adores . In one breath wedlock stands condemned of bovine placidity . In the next breath marriage is a failure because the sexes are in perpetual conflict and because woman is an eternal mystery . How a perpetual conflict can be tame , how an eternal mystery can be conducive to lassitude , how one can live in slippered ease with a sphinx about the house , we find it rather hard to understand . Mr. Wells tumbles into exactly this contradiction . Having assured us that in love one fails or wins home , and there 's an end of it , Mr. Wells devotes three hundred closely-printed pages to showing how Marjorie and Trafford labored to find out whether their love is actually a failure or whether they have in fact won home . It takes them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupies one for ten years argues a fairly difficult and absorbing puzzle There is certainly no spiritual or emotional stagnation in the married life of the Traffords . In the course of their . search after their own souls , what tense situations Mr. Wells compels thorn to face , what emotional storms they must weather , what adjustment and readjustment they attempt ! They ponder , they debate , they analyze their own attitudes towards each other and to the world , they indulge in regrets , they flame up with renewed hopes , they quarrel , they , flee for refuge to their children , they flee to the silence of their own souls in Labrador , they starve , they face death , they face the greatest thing in the world  --  which is Truth . How can a condition which makes such demands upon heart and brain and character conceivably be described as monotonous ? There are modern critics of marriage who are not altogether blind to this weakness in their case . The more careful and conscientious observers among them recognize that this business of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the period after the honeymoon is not one dead level of satiety . There are emotional revivals . The sacred flame leaps up again . Romance returns to its throne . ' The modern writer , taking cognizance of this well-established phenomenon , describes it as a process of falling in love again . That is the way Mr. Wells speaks of it . In his peculiar use of the word love to describe not a permanent ' state but a recurrent emotional condition , he still holds fast to the new school . Let us put the case crudely . Under the old-fashioned con ception , if husband and wife are in love on Sunday and are found to be in love on the Sunday following , the assumption was that the two have been lovers during the six days intervening . Under the new conception , husband and wife may be in love on Sunday , out of love on Monday and Tuesday , in love again on Wednesday and Thursday . Take the case of Marjorie and Trafford . Their marriage is a love marriage , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has painted with truly admirable skill and insight the glow , the exaltation , and the tenderness of first love . But upon the Traffords ' marriage follow disillusion , bewilderment , misunderstanding , tribulation . Trafford , as we have seen , succumbs to the lure of scientific research . Marjorie drifts into frivolous interests . They recognize the danger , and as a spiritual cure they decide to revisit the scenes of their honeymoon joUrney in the Italian Alps . The cure succeeds : Trafford seemed to have forgotten all the strain and disappointment of the past two years , to be amazed but in no wise incredulous at this enormous change in her and their outlook He was now deeply in love with her again The influence of Alpine scenery and the luxuries of a millionaire 's villa where the Traffords find themselves guests for a time continue the softening process . Away from suburban lectures and the fear of debt , Trafford begins to understand : He had judged her fickle , impulsive , erratic , perhaps merely because her mind had followed a different process from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constructive truth , her guide was a more immediate and instinctive sense of beauty . ? He ' was very much alive to her now , and deeply in love with her . Here you haVe a pretty complete statement of what we may call the spasmodic theory of love in marriage ; and when you come to analyze it , an oppressively vulgar theory it is . Our elders , after their commonplace , Philistine fashion , were not in the habit of exalting romantic love as the only foundation and justification of marriage . But in their own commonplace way they " worked out a theory of love which for-sweep and poetry renders the teachings , of the modern romantics utterly cheap . They thought and spoke of love b husband and wife as a continuous process which , like every other process in the physical and spiritual world , is subject to the law of ebb and flow . They were not blind to the facts of life . When they wrote the history of a pair of married lovers they took into account the ? upheaval and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts s temporary disillusionment , misunderstanding , hostilities , temporary regrets . But all these they viewed as isolated manifestations of a single rhythmic process which in. its . unity they called love . Is it a mere question of difference in terminology , or is there a real difference-of mind and heart indicated when people speak of love as a harmonic law of Iife or speak of it as a temporary appetite ? To us it seems that the difference is a very real one . At any rate , that is our quarrel with Mr. Wells . In essentials , he seems to be returning to-the older and deeper view of love in marriage ; but he can not rid himself of-the formulas and phrases he has gathered in the field of modern speculation ..

George Palmer PutnaM : A Memoir . Together with a Record of the Earlier Years of the Publishing House Founa , ed by Him . By George Haven Putnam , Litt.D . New York : G. P. Putnam 's Sons . $2.50 . The subject of this memoir died forty - years ago . He was an important figure in his day , and it is strange that a full generation should have passed before these records were got together .

He was not among - the great ones of his time , but he was - among the good and useful ones , and ' his private character and public ser-vices should not be forgotten . The basis of the book is a memoir printed some ten years ago for circulation in the fam-ily . Such parts have been taken from the narrative as were of more general interest , and the personal story is sup-plemented by various letters and papers . George Palmer Putnam was born in. and was destined to be a New Yorker , but he came of Massachusetts stock on both sides . His father was a Bostonian and a Harvard man , who broke down soon after his admission to the bar and retreated with his young wife to Brunswick , Me . Thereafter it seems to have been her duty not only to bear his children , but to support them . At eleven years , the fourth child , George , was apprenticed to a distant connection in Boston , a dealer in carpets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Without prospect of finding anything in particular at the end of the voyage , he took passage on a fast schooner which made the journey round the Cape in a week . Chance and the Want " columns gave him his first job in a little Broadway bookshop . The rest is the'familiar story of the poor boy pushing steadily on against the tide towards an achievement far beyond the ordinary . At that time ( the early thirties ) Boston was already somewhat in the lead as a publishing centre . The predecessors of Lippincott were established in Philadelphia , the Harpers were laying the foundations of their prosperity in New York ( not always in the most scrupulous way , according to the present chronicler ) , and there was a considerable number of minor firms which existed largely by the issuance of reprints . In Boston , the chief houses were Allen &; Ticknor , the forerunners of Ticknor &; Fields , and Little &; Brown , now Little , Town &; Co . The Jonathan .

With him Daniel Appleton , founder of the firm of Appleton , was associated at . the time ; and when he presently set up for himself , among the stock to be divided was a book called " Chronology , an Introduction and Index to Universal History , " by G.P. Putnam . The young clerk 's salary was $4.00 a week , but his duties kept him at the shop from early morning till nine or ten at night ; his spare time , such as it was , he spent in reading . History especially interested him , and he began the " Index " at the age of fifteen , as an aid to his own studies . Three years later it was published , almost the first work of its kind in English . But that little manual of dates was the first step in a long career of hard work and solid product . G. P. Putnam was one of the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every community  --  whom everybody counts on to do more than his share in whatever business he may be induced to connect himself with . He had a habit of being the working member of the- numerous committees upon which such a man is bound to find himself . At twenty-three he became secretary of , the first American association for the establishment of an international copyright law ; and his son dwells with special pride upon the fact that " in all the subsequent movements that were made on behalf of international copyright between 1837 and the time of his death in 1872 , my father took an active part , while a considerable proportion of these copyright undertakings were initiated at his own instance and were conducted largely through his efforts . " His zeal in this cause was plainly due to his sense of justice rather to than to self-interest . Publishers of that day , both in America and in England , were incredibly indifferent to the principle involved in copyright . Publishing was a cutthroat game , and it was generally understood that the devil might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when ( in 1840 ) the firm of Wiley &; Putnam entered the field , the junior partner declined to have anything to do with stolen books . " Irrespective of the protection or lack of protection afforded by the law , he held that authors should be left in full control of their own productions , and that political boundaries had no logical connection with the property rights of the producer . " Against the less scrupulous usage of his rivals Mr. Putnam stuck to this principle to the end of his career as a publisher . The same extreme conscientiousness ? whether or not it derived from his New England blood  --  determined his attitude in all matters , public or private . Moral obligations involved in a business failure brought about by the , crisis of 1857 were discharged as if they had been legal . The many philanthropic and political movements which engaged his interest were submitted to rigorous tests of right and wrong . On the other hand , it is clear that there was nothing forbidding or self-righteous in his nature . The long list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witness to his human charm . His one act of clairvoyance as a publisher seems to have been his taking up of Washington Irving 'S works when the Philadelphia publisher judged them to be of no further value as an investment ; and the affectionate relation between author and publisher which resulted , and which grew warmer with the years , was among the chief rewards of a useful life . The Posthumous Essays ' of John Murton Collins . Edited by L. C. Collins . New York : E. P. Dutton &; Co. $2 net . The late Professor Collins , Iike many greater men , paid the penalty for his versatility . He was a brilliant popular lecturer , a broad and thorough scholar , an intelligent - and sometimes acute literary critic . 33'ut two tendencies which no doubt strengthened him as a popularizer vitiated a good deal of his criticism , and sometimes led even his scholarship astray . One is his passion . for seeking the moral everywhere ; the other is his delight in the never-ending guest of the literary parallel . The pursuit of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in developing a sort of literary strabismus which sees parallelism in the sides of a right angle . A striking example of these faults  --  a highly moral and entirely false parallel between the attitudes of Sophocles and Shakespeare towards suicide , from Professor Collins 's ' " Studies in Shakespeare , " has just been pointed out by J. H. Hanford in Publications of the Modern Language Association . The core of the " Posthumous Essays " is a series of papers on great writers of the last century ? Wordsworth as a Teacher , Emerson , Arnold , Browning , and Tennyson . Both of the faults which have been mentioned are conspicuous in these essays . The phrase " as a teacher " might appropriately have been affixed to all the titles instead of to one , for Professor Collins is constantly concerned with the didactic qualities of his subjects . The few literary judgments in the essays on Wordsworth and Emerson are taken over bodily , in some cases almost word for word , from Matthew Arnold . In the very essay from which Professor Collins borrows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philosophy is poetically of small account ; yet Professor . Collins can say , " It is difficult to understand Matthew Arnold 's silence about the significance of Wordsworth 's metaphysical philosophy " ; and he , after expounding this philosophy , can predict that on account of it Wordsworth will ultimately be ranked above Milton and on an equality with Shakespeare . Tennyson interests Professor Collins because he grapples with - the problem , " How are the grand central doctrines of Christianity to be reconciled with the facts of science ? " Browning interests him because , like Bishop Butler , he teaches that " the moral government of God implies that we are in a state of trial with reference to a future world . " The parallel with Butler is worked out in ' detail , and there are similar extended parallels with Lessing , and  --  save the mark ) ? with Montaigne . Professor Collins 's parallel-hunting at its worst , however , can be more briefly illustrated by a quotation from the essay on Wordsworth : ' When Chrysippus tells us that all ethical inquiries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world , and ' that it is only by a study of Nature and of what God is that anything really satisfactory can be stated about good and evil , we see how near we are to Words*worth ; it is exactly One impulse from a vernal wood May teach you more of man , Of moral evil and of good , Than all the sages can . The vision of a critic who sees parallelism , much less identity , in these two lines of thought is indeed strangely distorted . Besides these nineteenth-century essays , the volume contains a group of miscellaneous papers of very uneven value  --  a sympathetic sketch of Dr. Johnson , a rather commonplace defence of Burke 's consistency , a lecture on Shakespearean theatres , an admirable study of William Godwin and Mary Wollstonecraft , and a collection of " Curiosities of Popular Proverbs " in which Professor Collins 's delight in parallelism finds legitimate scope . Beginning with Lord John Russell 's happy definition of a proverb , " One man 's wit and all men 's wisdom , " this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular sayings . It may be remarked that " to make a virtue of necessity " is much older than Matthew Paris , the earliest source referred to by Professor Collins ; it is used twice by St. Jerome , and was evidently proverbial in his time . The lecture on " Shakespearean Theatres " is picturesque , but rather inaccurate . It would be unfair to hold Professor Collins responsible for slips in the statement of fact , since his son tells us in the preface that part of his task was " to put into shape passages which were little more than rough notes . " But it is unfortunate that an author who was so severe upon others for such inaccuracies should be represented as saying that " the ' Fortune ( Theatre ) was erected about 1598 , " or that James Burbage " played all the great parts in Shakespeare . " Besides such obvious errors , the essay contains a good many dogmatic assertions on disputed matters . Its inclusion in the volume seems a mistake . The essay on Godwin and Mary Wollstonecraft is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Professor Collins skilfully outlines the characters and story of this remarkable pair , and gives an excellent summary of their doctrines . It is interesting to see in how many ways they anticipated movements which have grown powerful in our own time . Mary deserves more credit than she often gets as a pioneer of the woman 's rights movement . Besides Go.dwin 's revolutionary political teaching , his'position with reference to marriage is almost identical with that of the most " advanced " modern theorists , such as Ellen Key . It is less generally known that he anticipated Mrs. Eddy . " He would contend , " Mrs. Shelley tells us , " that death and disease existed only ' through the feebleness of man 's mind , and  --  happy man ! ? that pain had no reality . " As a whole , although the " Posthumous Essays " will add nothing to Professor Collins 's reputation , they will not seriously detract from it . With all their perversities Of moralizing and parallel izing , they contain much that will interest every lover of literature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pratt . New York : D. Appleton &; Co. $1.75 net . This work has a large scope . The author describes it as " an account of the functions , methods , and history of the New York money and stock markets . " It is all that , and more . For Wall Street , like Saint Germain , is not a place , but a state . The term has both an objective and a subjective connotation . It implies the whole American field of material production and distribution , on the one side , and the whole American philosophy with reference to the largest utilization of that field , on the other . Wall Street represents things and the ways those things are regarded by the people who handle them . Mr. Pratt discourses entertainingly and instructively on both of these aspects . He does not possess  --  few persons do  --  the broad vision , the capacity for subtle distinctions , the fluidity and flexibility of language , displayed by Walter Bagehot in " Lombard Street . " He has , however , brought together a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and many-sided observation , and has given them a relevancy which most persons unaided are quite likely to overlook . - The present work is an amplification and a recasting of a treatise on Wall Street issued in 1903 . Much has happened since then , both in the way of industrial and economic transformation and in the way of public agitation for a new philosophy of speculation , to furnish a reason for this revision . The nation has passed through a great financial panic ; the New York trust companies have been admitted to the Clearing House , and the Clearing House methods have been improved in various ways ; improvements have been made in the New York Stock Exchange rules , among them one involving the abolition of the unlisted department ; the question of combination or competition in the conduct of industry has been vigorously debated in and out of Congress ; many important court decisions , notably by the United States Supreme Court , have been rendered in connection with the Sherman Anti-Trust law ; the Monetary Commission has made a laborious study of the banking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valuable literature. ; the . Railroad Securities Committee , headed by President Hadley of Yale University , has made an elab- , orate report on the principles which , should govern the issuance of railway securities . No decade in American history has been more transforming than that which has elapsed since Mr. Pratt produced the first edition of the work before us . This period has furnished much food for the reflection which has been put into the chapter on Investment , Speculation , and Gambling . If we restore the true meanings of these terms , we shall , says Mr. Pratt , promote sound thinking on some important subjects . Even the report of the Hughes Commission , admirable as it is in most respects , is , he adds , not altogether clear in the distinctions it makes between investment and gambling . While it shows conclusively the economic advantages of speculation , it reveals some confusion of thought which is likely to do harm in befogging the issues at stake . In saying that speculation may be wholly legitimate , or pure gambling , or may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far less accurate than in declaring that a distinction exists between speculation which is carried on by persons of means based on intelligent forecast and that which is carried on by persons without these qualifications . Speculation , contends our author , is never gambling , though the machinery , which is created to facilitate the operations of speculation , may be used by gamblers . Speculation has no stancher defender than Mr. Pratt . Speculation , he declares , is a part of the great system of distribution to which credit and transportation belong  --  it performs in its way the same service for the world that credit and transformation do . It facilitates the process of distributing products to consumers . It is , in fact , a balance-wheel . That is , when it is the right kind of speculation , for while most Of us must , with President Hadley , deplore the extent to which speculation is carried at the present day , we must also agree with him that there is a right kind of speculation which seems to be an absolute necessity for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are we to conserve this kind and destroy the other ? Is it worth while to enact laws to prevent speculation in order to make gambling impossible ? If it is not . worth while , is it possible by new rules and regulations to destroy the opportunities for stock gambling while preserving the opportunities for speculation ? The Hughes Commission frankly admitted the impossibility of distinguishing what is virtually gambling from legitimate speculation , and acted on the principle that exchanges can accomplish more than Legislatures . It recommended a number of changes in the New York Stock Exchange system , nearly all of which have been substantially adopted ; but gambling goes on . Yet there are those who propose to enact laws to make speculation in stocks impossible , the consequences of which must , in Mr. Pratt 's judgment , be disastrous .
