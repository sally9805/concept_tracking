" The Practical Book of Early American Arts and Crafts , " by Harold Donaldson Eberlein and Abbot McClure , is announced by J. B. Lippincott Company . The following volumes of the Cambridge University Press are announced by G. P. Putnam 's Sons : " The Anthocyanin Pigments of Plants , " by Muriel Wheldale ; " The Commentaries of Isho'dad of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) in Syriac and English " ( Rom Semiticm , No . XI ) , edited and translated by Margaret Dunlop Gibson ; " The Rhesus " of Euripides , edited by W. H. Porter ; " The Earliest Voyages Round the World ( 1519-1617 ) , " edited by Philip F. Alexander . Two new volumes ( Holt ; 50 cents net each ) in the series called Writers of the Day are as good as their predecessors : that is , they are first-rate pieces of informal and thoroughly journalistic criticism . Harold Child writes of " Thomas Hardy " with undue emphasis upon Hardy 's poetry , to which he gives one-third his volume , and with a fatuous attempt to show that Hardy 's philosophy of the control of life by an impersonal , heedless , Immanent Will is sure to supplant in the generation following the war what he calls the present belief in a dualism of good and evil . But he discusses the novels , which he classifies under Hardy 's own heading of novels of character and environment , novels of ingenuity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound and well put , if by no means profound , is his insistence upon the element of optimism in Hardy , as witnessed by the novelist 's evident belief in mellorism . As he remarks of " Tess , " if homespun humanity can be so beautiful , can so love and endure and trust , may we not feel joy and pride ? When we contemplate suchbeauty slowly ruined by causes that man himself has power to remove , what results but a determination to remove them , and to let no stupidity or timidity stand in the way of the virtues and happiness that human nature may realize ? Hugh Walpole on " Joseph Conrad " is similarly excellent in discussing his author 's novels , though when he strays into comparative criticism his verdicts on general tendencies in fiction and on the novels of other English and American writers are to be distrusted . He comes near the heart of the subject when he observes that Conrad is of the resolute conviction that life is too strong , clever , and remorseless for the sons of men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characters , he most definitely admires , among the qualities in the human soul , blind courage and obedience to duty . The " case method , " which has been made famous by the Harvard Law School and which has found a more or less wide acceptance throughout the country , is peculiarly well suited to that branch of law which governs the relations between nations . A quarter of a century ago Dr. Freeman Snow published an admirable case-book for this purpose . The cases were so well selected and condensed that the underlying principles stood forth clearly for the student ; and the general subject was outlined in a very helpful syllabus of references to cases and textbook writers . Dr. Snow 's volume was later edited and greatly expanded , though not in every respect improved for the student 's use , by Prof. J. B. Scott . There has been a need for another case-book , especially in view of the rapid advance in the matter of arbitration and the accepted principles of International Law . Is this need met by the new " Internatione/ Cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Practiced by Independent States , " Vol . I , edited by Ellery C. Stowell and Henry F. Munro ( Houghton Mifflin ; $2.50 ) ? This first volume on Peace , presumably to be followed by one on War , contains only about two hundred selections , whereas the corresponding part of Scott 's volume deals in about the same number of pages with some five hundred cases . Scott 's Cases are nearly all real " cases , " that is , decisions of the courts declaring actual law , at any rate for the parties to the suit . A considerable number of Stowell 's selections are not cases at all , but are narratives of international episodes and arbitrations or summaries from Moore 's " Digest of International Law . " The volume is more like a book of " readings " to accompany a textbook of International Law , than a Simon-pure casebook meant to stand by itself . It might have been improved if some of the selections had been more condensed ; if references had been made to more cases , particularly where there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that given in the selection chosen ; and if the index had been made more complete and analytical . We may add , however , that these readings are often more spicy and dramatic than the solemn decisions handed down from the bench in Scott 's Cases . They are in large part recent and fresh , and wisely give prominence to controversies decided by arbitration . Whether , however , the book will make a satisfactory substitute for Scott 's Cases may be doubted . It is not sufficiently comprehensive , and it does not adequately indicate either the progress made in the development of International Law or the conflict of opinion which still obtains in regard to many phases of the subject in different countries . J. S. Machar ( born in 1864 ) is a Bohemian poet who has won fame by a revolt from the " poetry of boudoirs and marble halls , " as that of Vrchlicky and his school has been termed , to a realistic and satiric style akin to that of prose fiction . Were it not for Professor Wiener 's introductory note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; $1.25 net ) , one would hardly suspect that the original was in verse . The book tells the story of a girl rescued from a brothel by a wealthy young dilettante , more from a sentimental whim than from any real desire to help her in her misery . In the world of respectability she meets only scorn and insult . At last , when even her rescuer , his sentimental philanthropy having lost its zest , shows his hidden brutality , the poor girl meditates suicide , but , her courage failing , returns to the house from which she has been taken . The strength of the book is not in the vague and sketchy portrait of the heroine , but in the picture of the world of petty interests and raging hatreds into which she is set free . Except for the shadowy Magdalen , the kindly old aunt of her rescuer is the one sympathetic and appealing figure in the tale . Particularly virulent satire is visited on the Bohemian " patriots , " with their wordy appeals to a dead past . The volume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Professor Wiener , which one may hope will continue as excellently as it has begun . In the title of his book , " England and Germany . 1740-1914 " ( Princeton University Press ; $2 net ) , Prof. Bernadotte Everly Schmitt , of Western Reserve University , promises to extend the perspective of European events much farther back than 1870 ; he implies that he will trace the course of AngloGerman relations methodically from 1740 to 1914 . Unfortunately he does not fulfil this promise . He follows up his general Introduction with a chapter on Modern England and reaches his discussion of Gladstone 's policies on the seventh page of the chapter . The third chapter , the German Empire , begins with events of 1848 ( ! ) and hardly mentioning anything before that year discusses chiefly events of the reign of William II . German Expansion and Commercial Rivalry deal , of course , with the same period , and it is not until the sixth chapter that Professor Schmitt makes an effort at a logical presentation of Anglo-German relations prior to 1850 . Even at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more might have been made of the relation between Frederick the Great and the two Georges , II and III , and not a word is said about Prussia and England in 1804 and 1805 . In short , it is not at all clear why 1740 is named as a starting-point . Professor Schmitt is well informed , but bias in favor of England leads him more than once to a false perspective of German affairs , to inconsistencies of statement , and even to direct errors . This is true especially of his chapter on the German Empire . The Reichstag has not been dissolved five times ( p. 38 ) . It is certainly over-bold to assert ( p. 40 ) that three of the four millions who voted for the Social-Democratic ticket in 1912 would have voted with one of the national parties if the realization of the Social-Democratic programme had seemed probable . Frederick William IV did remark that a sheet of paper should never thrust itself between the Lord God and his country ( p. 42 ) , but he said it in fear lest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not as a threat after a constitution had been adopted . Why is opposition to the Government on the part of the Conservatives " a thing unthinkable " ( p. 43 ) ? The Conservatives opposed the Government very vigorously in the early seventies ; they hampered the Government seriously in the first half of the nineties , and indirectly they forced the resignation of Billow in 1909 . In the nineties William II was goaded by the opposition of the Conservatives to the angry outburst quoted by Professor Schmitt ( p. 68 ) : " an opposition of the Prussian nobility to their King is a monstrosity . " Has William II really rid himself " of each Chancellor , from Bismarck to Billow , at the least sign of insubordination " ? By no means . Bismarck was dismissed after several differences of opinion with the Emperor , Hohenlohe retired of his own volition on account of old age , and there is no evidence to prove that the Emperor even suggested the resignation of either Caprivi or Billow . Overstatement and bias are faults of Professor Schmitt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make the above points against it if the book had no merits . The second half of the book is far better than the first half . Professor Schmitt discusses events of the last few years before the war with well-founded confidence , and he states the German side of recent Anglo-German rivalry and controversy with care and accuracy . His chapter on the Near East is an admirable piece of work . Also , with a fine sense of the dramatic , he describes the clearing sky of the spring of 1914 and , in sharp contrast with this , the sudden bolt from the blue which shattered European diplomacy . If all of Professor Schmitt 's book were on the high level of his last chapters , few faults could be found in it . That Professor Schmitt has not given his best throughout the book , that the book therefore falls short of what it might have been , is cause of genuine regret . Students of history will welcome the new ( fifth ) edition of J. H. Rose 's " The Development of the European @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is a reprint , identical as to paging and maps with the original edition of 1905 , but contains three supplementary chapters and is published as two volumes in one at a reduced price . These supplementary chapters , The New Grouping of the Powers , Teuton versus Slav , and The Crisis of 1914 , bring the narrative down to the beginning of the present war . They add little to what has already become familiar from the published diplomatic correspondence and from the studies of Headlam , Stowell , Rachfahl , and others , but they do explain in a brief , clear , unbiassed way the complex diplomatic moves which have been taking place since the epoch-making establishment of the Anglo-French Entente in 1904 . Mr. Rose emphasizes the Kaiser 's purpose of championing Islam by his relations with Abdul Hamid , the Bagdad project , and the Tangiers speech ; all this , he thinks , was preparatory to stirring a hostile fanaticism among the millions of Moslem subjects of England and France . Though shaken for a moment by the Young Turk revolution , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " the Ottoman Empire remained the despair of patriotic reformers , a hunting ground for Teutonic concessionnaires , a Hell for its Christian subjects , and the chief storm-centre of Europe . " The main part of Mr. Rose 's book needs little comment , as it has been favorably known for a decade . While it can not be said to reach the high level of originality nor to rest on the solid foundations of documentary evidence ( since the documents are mostly still secretly guarded ) which distinguish his valuable studies on Napoleon and Pitt , it is nevertheless one of the most convenient summaries in English of European diplomatic history since the Franco-Prussian war . For it is of international relations which it mainly treats , not of the internal development of the nations , as the title might suggest . In particular , it gives a relatively full account of the two subjects which have caused most friction among the Powers  --  the partition of Africa and the Near Eastern crises arising from the decay of the Ottoman Power . " The Hague Conventions and Declarations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different pamphlets by James Brown Scott for the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace , have been brought together in a single convenient volume ( Oxford University Press ; $1 ) . Arrangement in parallel columns , marginal reference notes , a full index , and an introduction all tend to facilitate reference to these documents which have become so important because of the war . One wants to know what are the exact obligations of each nation . For this purpose the most valuable feature of the volume is the careful table showing precisely what nations have signed , adhered to , or ratified the various conventions and declarations , and precisely what reservations have been made in each case . The volume is thus less extensive than the similar one of Mr. A. Pearce Higgins ( 1909 ) , in that it gives no commentary on the documents , gives only the English translation instead of adding the original French text , and does not contain the Declaration of London ; but it is more up to date , the table of adhesions and ratifications having been verified by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ December , 1914 ; it also gives in more complete form the text of the reservations . Ray and Oliver Strachey have added an illuminating chapter to the History of the English East India Company by their account of " Keigwin 's Rebellion " ( Oxford Historical and Literary Studies , ed . C. H. Firth and Walter Raleigh , Vol . VI ; 7s. 6d . ) . Sir William Hunter , in his " History of British India , " gives only a page or two to this curious Bombay mutiny of 1683 , by which Capt . Keigwin expelled the Honorable Company 's civil officials , seized the island in the name of his Majesty the King , and so held it for nearly a year , in spite of all the company 's efforts to regain it . This was the period when , according to Hunter , " two remarkable brothers obtained an . ascendency in the company 's counsels ? Sir Josia Child at home and Sir John Child in India . " In his account of " the Child brothers " Hunter reiterates some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violent partisan , Alexander Hamilton , an old " interloper , " whose " New Account of the East Indies " is a perfect storehouse of scandalous libels against the company 's officials . We are apt to regard Hunter as an unquestioned authority on the F4 1.4t India Company , but the authors of " Keigwin 's Rebellion " show that his generally admirable bird's-eye view suffers at this point from the defects inevitable to an historian who attempts a general r  --  sum ? before the ground has been sufficiently worked over . From their researches in the Herald 's office in London they show undoubtedly that " the Child brothers " were not brothers at all ; they were not even relatives , and never saw each other . It was a mere coincidence in names that Sir Josia Child , whose appearance as a London merchant instead of as Emperor of China or the Great Mogul seems an error of Providence , exercised his despotic rule over the company in Leadenhall Street during the same years that Sir John was trying to rule at Surat and Bombay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hunter describes , was the weak and subservient agent of Josia . He was forced to pursue an unwise tradesman 's policy of retrenchment in disarmament quite incompatible with what a vigorous captain like Keigwin knew to be necessary for the prestige and security of the English in the crumbling Empire of the Moguls . The rebellion , of which the authors are the first to give the correct details , is an episode which supports the dictum that India must be governed from India , and not from England . The volume also contains a lively picture of the English settlement and trade on the west coast of India in the second half of the seventeenth century  --  the powerful but corruptible Mogul Governor , the troublesome interlopers from England , and the dangerous neighboring Mahrattas , Siddees , and Sanganye pirates . Recent works on the hope of Immortality show divergencies from the ordinary arguments on the subject . Thus , " The Gift of Immortality " ( Houghton Mifflin ; $1 ) , by Rev. Dr. Charles Lewis Slattery , dwells on the beneficent influences of the expectation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ author , gives largeness to one 's view of life , and promotes peace , the vigor of action , and devotion to the highest ethical ideal . This is the " pragmatic " argument  --  the truth of the belief is known by its results . As to the fact that God has not chosen to enlighten men concerning the nature of the future life , Dr. Slattery observes that this divine decision doubtless involves a wise purpose  --  perhaps we are not prepared to profit by such disclosure . This unpretentious little volume is marked by good judgment and a good spirit . A quite different line of thought is pursued in " The Meaning of Personal Life " ( Scribner ; $2 ) , by Rev. Dr. Newman Smyth . The results of recent biological discussion are here given in considerable detail for the purpose of asking whether there is any causal connection between man 's individual mental lite and the bodily conditions that accompany it . His painstaking examination of the biological facts has convinced him that no such causal connection exists . Dr. Smyth has occasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , and he shows everywhere wide reading and a judicial habit of thought . He is mainly concerned to set aside scientific objections to the conception of a future life . Such life , he holds , must have some sort of bodily framework ; as to the nature of this framework he does not commit himself , but is content to state the possibilities in the case . The highest development of personality he finds in Jesus of Nazareth , to whom he ascribes not only what is given of Jesus 's words and acts in the Gospels ( including the Fourth Gospel ) , but also whatever of high spiritual life has emerged in Christian history and experience . A good deal of the biological material here adduced is of a technical nature and its bearing on the question at issue can hardly be properly estimated by non-specialists , but the author 's general line of argument is clearly set forth , and will awaken serious consideration of the great questions discussed . The character and aims of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America are set forth by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volume , " Seminary Addresses and Other Papers " ( Cincinnati : Ark Publishing Co . ) . The Seminary , as its charter states , is devoted to the study of the Old Testament and the Talmud , the maintenance of the Jewish religion and Jewish ideals , and the training of Jewish ministers of religion . The scheme of study , according to Dr. Schechter 's view , does not exclude attention to modern non-Jewish literature and science ; these , he holds , may be intellectually broadening , and they will naturally be used in illustration of Jewish thought . The Zionist movement is not endorsed by the Seminary , which leaves its students free in their attitude towards the movement ; but the president himself is wholly in sympathy with it , believing that a main duty of Jews , at the present time , is to work for the development of the Jewish nationalistic snirit. and in sranPrni fen , la , o of the traditional Judaism . This volume is dedicated to Dr. Cyrus Adler , President of the Philadelphia Dropsie College , which also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jewish ancient and modern literature . Dr. Schechter cordially dislikes the methods of the Cincinnati Hebrew College , which represents the temper of the Reform movement now visible throughout the Jewish world , and particularly in this country . With individual members of the Reform he appears to have no quarrel , but he opposes their results with the same ardor that he shows in speaking of the scholars who presume to reconstruct the text of the Old Testament and the advocates of the doctrine of Evolution , who , he thinks , are in danger of pushing that theory to an extreme unpleasant to a conservative mind . The articles in this volume are well written  --  they are enthusiastic in support of their theme , but generally kindly in tone , as kindly at least as can be expected in a work directed against what the author believes to be an attempt to destroy the foundations of a cherished national life . Besides the articles dealing with Jewish thought and life , there are three of a general character , among them an excellent study of Abraham Lincoln . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Knox 's " Historical Journal of the Campaigns in North America , " edited by Arthur G. Doughty , the Dominion Archivist . This volume contains the appendix , list of works consulted , and a very full index . In the appendix Dr. Doughty has brought together a number of documents bearing on the campaigns of 1757-1760 , from the Public Record Office , the Dominion Archives , and other sources . Among these documents are the Journals of Amherst , Murray , and Vauquelin ; the Memoires of Moiatcalm , and de Levis ; MacKellar 's Report on Quebec , Sir William Johnson 's private diary ; Letter of a French officer of the garrison of Louisbourg ; and various papers relating to the capitulation of Fort Frontenac , Murray 's expedition above Quebec in August , 1759 , the surrender of Quebec , etc . Altogether , Dr. Doughty has produced an admirable piece of editorial work , accurate and scholarly . He has spared no pains to include in this volume every document essential to a full understanding of the events described in Knox 's Journal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notes , finding the difficult mean between inadequacy and overloading . The illustrations include several facsimiles of rare documents and five maps . The last two numbers of the American Journal of International Law ( those for April and July ) contain , as usual , a large amount of valuable material . The opening article of the April number is of particular interest , being Mr. Root 's presidential address at the tenth annual meeting of the society whose organ the Journal is . The subject of this address was the declaration on " The Rights and Duties of Nations " of another society , newly founded , the American Institute of International Law . The composition of the new society is interesting and holds in it the promise of much valuable work , for it consists of delegates selected , to a limited number , from societies of all the American countries . The Institute was founded , Mr. Root explained , with no idea of competition wifin +ha inctitnt AP TIrnit Tntprnational. which selects its members from all civilized countries , but for the discussion of those international @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ postulate laid down by the Institute , commonplace of international law though it be , is a good augury for the aims of the new society : each individual nation has the same right as every other nation , and no state is justified in seeking any national object , however desirable , by the commission of an unlawful act against other states . Other topics discussed in this number are our Mexican relations , the negotiations between China and Japan in 1915 , the treatment of enemy vessels in belligerent Ports at the outbreak of war , and the duty of nations not involved to protest against violation of the rules and principles of international law generally accepted . In the July number special interest attaches to the separately printed supplement of 110 pages . Here are printed in great detail regulations of several countries governing the visits of men-of-war to foreign ports , and correspondence , reproduced from texts furnished by the Department of State , between Mexico and the United States regarding the punitive expedition and Villa 's attack on the American garrison at Columbus . The correspondence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ March 9 , the date of Carothers 's notification of the raid on Columbus , to June 20 , when Mr. Lansing returned a negative reply to Aguilar 's long communication of May 22 requesting the withdrawal of the American troops . In view of recent oratory from both parties , it is interesting to note the form of Mr. Lansing 's refusal , towards the end of his communication : " If the Government of Mexico can not protect the lives and property of Americans exposed to attack from Mexico , the Government of the United States is in duty bound , so far as it can , to do so . " In the Journal itself we have two careful articles on the sale of munitions of war by the subjects of neutral countries , and an elaborate paper , translated from the Spanish of Salvador Rodriguez Gonzales on the " Neutrality of Honduras and the Question rf the Gulf of Fonseca .

Another editorial , by the editor-in-chief , considers in illuminating fashion proposed amendments to the neutrality laws of the United States .
