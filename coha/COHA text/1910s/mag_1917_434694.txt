AFTER the fall of Nish my division had retreated on the right bank of the Morava River ; its task was to prevent the Bulgarians from crossing , and to keep open for traffic the high road toward the south on the left bank . The combined army of fifty thousand men had to pass along this road . South of Nish , on the left hank of the river , stretched the valley of the Morava for twenty miles ; in front of Lesko-vats this valley became undulating and ascending . Around the town the mountains rose like a gigantic amphit heat re . In order to enter the town one must pass through a wide , natural gateway between two beautiful romantic hills which ended the amphitheatre . This pass faced the river , beyond which was the mountainside on which my division was intrendied . The highway from Nish and Kruschevatz went through the central part of the valley and turned to the left near Leskovatz , leading on through the pass and the town into the mountain fastnesses . If the whole combined army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then my division could take positions around the town in natural fortresses , where they could easily defend the place and hold the enemy back until the combined army had time to escape beyond the mountains . But could this be done ? The Bulgarian army had not attacked us for some time with infantry , but had discharged their wicked shells , which exploded high above us , staining the pure blue of the skies with smoke . I took advantage of this respite to look through my field-glasses at the valley below me . Thousands and thousands of human beings were creeping along the valley ! Here and there one could see masses moving very slowly . These masses were composed of men , women , and children , oxen , cows , sheep , goats , dogs ? all jammed together , painfully pushing forward . I could see that they tried to hurry their slow march , but it seemed as if they stumbled at each stopover invisible obstacles , and it seemed too as if some great force ? the spirit of their native land , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go forward . The homes of these people had been burned and destroyed without pity . The fields had been trampled and their fruits ruthlessly crushed into the earth . The rivers were flowing turbid with blood . The songs of the brooks had been drowned by the scream and crash of shot and shell . The forests had been uprooted , broken , ruined , enveloped in smoke and stench . The cemeteries were demolished and desecrated , andthe flowers on the tombs were trampled by the hoofs of horses . The bells would never ring again from the white towers of the churches . The grandfathers and grandmothers had been killed amid the ashes of their homes . Song and happiness were replaced by weeping and wailing , the crash of artillery , unspeakable ferocity and cruelty . It was now a land of horror from which they fled ? this country which they thought would always be a land of happiness and love , a flowery corner where one could live as in Paradise . Always to be the good mother ? their clear native land ! And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fright had stiffened their limbs and horror had palsied their minds . My glasses showed me dreadful pictures . A mother carried her infant bound on her back . She clasped the next younger one to her breast , and the older ones , holding to her skirt , ran after her , barefooted , half-clothed , weeping and crying from fear , cold , and hunger . When one of these little ones grew so weak ; when his little heart began to beat so slowly ; when his little feet , wounded , cut , bloody , and exhausted , could no longer carry his tired body , and his tiny hand , which had held fast to his mother 's skirt , was no longer able to hold on , then he let go of the skirt , which was his only shelter ; his mother was lost to him and he stood alone . The poor woman could not hear his appealing cry ; there were five others around her who were weeping . Suddenly a flock of frightened sheep rushed by , and the child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cows and wagons . Some one among the refugees , who had not yet lost his heart amid this horror , picked up the little body and threw it into a ditch near the road that it might not be crushed any more . In such times , unhappy is every woman who bears the name of mother ! THE GRAVEYARD I saw young girls carrying white bundles in which were all the wedding garments , which they had spun and woven in happiness of heart , always with songs on their beautiful lips . Shame , fear , and horror were marked upon their young faces , for the victors had no pity . I saw men and old women loaded with things saved from the fire , or wrested from the bloody hands of the enemy . Oh , how they staggered , those old people , under the weight of these precious burdens , all that remained of their former riches , and the remnant of life 's labor ! Before them were driven the weary and starving cattle . They begged these poor creatures to ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little farther . ' No one knows the number who died in that grim valley , or the heartrending scenes there . When an only child fell , its mother would lie beside it and with her last strength gather the child to her breast and wait for their black fate . I saw also the long , dark lines of infantry . How they.staggered , wavered and broke , but quickly gathered themselves in order and marched on ! Blackened , ragged , bloody , bearing many wounds , yet , with resolute looks and clenched teeth , carrying in their hearts faith in strength and justice , marched these men , stronger than death ? the last defenders of their native land . Everywhere along this valley one could see hundreds and hundreds of wagons . Some turned aside from the thronged roads into the fields , where they tried to go on ; but the horses were worn out , the wagons overloaded , the men had made their last efforts . They could go no farther : they remained there , sunk in the sleep mud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mingled weeping , screaming , and crying of children , the groans of men , and the lowing and bellowing of the animals . // I leaned my head against the cold stone to shut out this horrible scene , and held both hands over my breast that my heart should not break . II At two o'clock in the afternoon the colonel called all the officers of my regiment . As my captain had been wounded ten days before , I , being the next oldest officer , had replaced him and gone to the colonel to take his orders . In a small narrow cup of the hills , shut in by gray rocks , I found him with the other officers around him . I was frightened by the looks of these men . They were pale , dirty , bloodstained , ragged , exhausted , and unshaven . Some of them had bandaged bands , others had bandaged heads . Most of them had no caps ; some were shivering with fever ; others could hardly stand because of intolerable pain . God ! did I look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young men who went into the struggle two months ago ? As the youngest I took the last place . We were all standing motionless , waiting for orders from the colonel , who stood before us . He looked tenderly upon us ; his eyes dimmed , and a shadow seemed to pass over his face . His glance fell ; he sighed deeply . Suddenly he straightened himself and threw out his chest ; and , looking upon us again with a firm resolute gaze , thus spoke the ' Old Lion ' : ? ' Gentlemen , I could have sent a written order to you , but 1 summoned you to say that our efforts have been rewarded . We have saved the combined army . Also I wish to say that the Vojvoda sends congratulations to you . And I , I admire you , gentlemen ! This is not flattery . You know that I can not flatter , nor do I wish to , for it would be an insult to your efforts and your bravery . Gentlemen , I simply admire you with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have done and I know what you must do . Officers , it is demanded of us to defend Lescovatz ; Serbia demands . that you die in order to MVO her other children ! ' The colonel was silent for a Moment . A deathly hush fAupoN. us , I ? looked upon the men auonnti me . A young lieutenant b ( Aide me grupt4 cotkvul-sively at my hand to . kay .. front t filing .

A captain beside hint had a wounded arm which was slung from his neck in a colored shawl , beneath which could be seen the hand , red and swollen ; slowly he drew up his other hand and placed it over the wounded one , that the ot hers might not look upon it . Another , a captain , clenched his teeth to prevent their chattering from the racking fever which shook him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Farther on stood a young major who was without a cap ; his face was red , his hair wet , and from his forehead great drops of sweat ran clown . One could see that he was consumed by raging fever . But in spite of all this , when the colonel spoke hislast words , every man straightened up . Their looks showed that they had understood the colonel and were ready to make this last sacrifice . The colonel continued : ' I have received orders from headquarters . During this day and the coming night , the combined army will pass through the pass of Lescovatz . You know that the main attack of the Bulgarians was against this army . It has fought for a month and withstood all these attacks , surviving superhuman efforts , and , at last , has marched day and night without rest . The men are exhausted . Beyond Lescovatz are the mountains , through which the advance is very difficult , and for these worn men it will be still more trying . This means that they must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them by defending Lescovatz . Here is the plan . The Twentieth , Eighteenth , and our regiment will cross the Morava at once , and take the positions around the town . The Fourteent h regiment will remain ' here With , a detachment of mountain artillery and check the enemy during the clay and following night until three o'clock in the morning , when they will cross the river , blowing up the bridge behind them . Meanwhile we must make all possible preparations for the fight of the next day . My regiment will defend the position at the right of the town . To every company I give its section . ' Then the colonel told the commanders their sections , and gave the precise information . Presently he came to me : Second company of the fourth battalion ? ' he asked me . Yes , sir . ' How many soldiers have you in your company ? ' About one hundred and fifty , sir . ' That means that you have lost more than a hundred . Take better care of your children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I smiled bitterly . One hundred and fifty ! ' continued the colonel . " Ilia is a fine number . Others do not have half as many . Because of this I have decided to give you a very important position . You will occupy the position at ? lirno Brdo Peaceful Hill , which is at the right side of the pass . You will dig trenches toward the pass and the valley . I will give you two field-cannon and three machine-guns . Do you see how I take care of my children ? Remember ? dig the trenches deep as possible and as soon as you can . Do you understand ? ' ' Yes , sir . ' I was the last one to receive orders . Meanwhile the other commanders Are nt to places where they could examine the valley and the position of Lescovat.a . Some used field-glasses and all had amps . I took my map to locate my ' Peaceful and quickly found it . I felt as if I had been struck : I saw the mark of a cemetery on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my Reid-glasses to make sure that I was right . It was true ; I distinctly saw the crosses , the graves , and the white monuments , A cemetery ! I did not know what to thin k . The colonel was moving away . I ran over to him . ' There is a cemetery , sir , over the whole of my position ! ' The colonel looked at ne with surprise and smiled bitterly . ' I know . Well ? ' firing line goes along the crest of the hill and I shall have to dig my trenches through the middle of the cemetery among the graves ? ' I know ! Well ? ' ' I low can I dig up the graves ? ' ' How ? With pick ? with pick and shovel , my boy ! Listen ! I do not defend the dead , but the firing . I do not defend cemeteries , but our native land . 1 ) o you understand ? ' Yes , sir , ' I whispered . ' How right he is ! ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company . My company still had four platoons . The sergeants of these were good men and very brave . Two of them I was especially fond of , Bora and Cheda . Bora was a lad scarcely t.NNTrl t y years old . He was a student in the University of Geneva , where I had met hint two years before . He was a handsome , well-built fellow ; smiles and songs were always on his lips . In the most terrible battles he had sung . Ile used to say that when a man sings he has no time to think about fear , suffering , fatigue , or pain . And so he sang and sang . He was always cheerful and never complained . We all loved him . Many times I have heard the soldiers say , ' We would die to save a hair of flora 's head . ' Checks was the opposite of flora ? an older man , small , bent , always serious and quiet . Ile was a peasant , but naturally very intelligent , with a big heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ braver man . I 11 the most dreadful battles he would put his hands in his pockets and give commands to his soldiers with marvelous coolness and calmness ; he never sought to shelter himself . Ile ss'as a married man , with three children . I loved him , too ! To Cheda aml flora I was not a commander , but a real brother . The time came for my company to cross the bridge . The weary and careworn soldiers went , silently . Perhaps they were ( miet because of fatigue , pain , and hunger , or perhaps it was because I was very sad , worried and anxious , for I usually talked and joked with them . Bora , too , was quiet for a while , but presently he came to me , asking in a worried tone , ' Why are you so gloomy , ? ' I could not answer him ; I could not speak . Aly head dropped . But the lad continued , ' Where are we going ? ' " ro the cemetery , ' I replied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have been walking in a cemetery ! Joking aside , where are We go-ing ? ' ' To the cemetery , to ( Ise real cemetery , to dig up the graves ! ' Bora grasped my sleeve and looked in my face , his fine eyes wide with consternation and fright . I saw that he was much overcome , and spoke quietly to bins . I have received orders to take the positions at Peaceful Hill . And that is the cemetery of Lescovatz . We are obliged to dig up the graves in order to make the trenches . Do you understand now ? ' 850 THE GRAVEYARD BY THE MORAVA ' So it is true , after all , ' he said . Then wit bout wailing for my answer he ran to t ell Cheda the news . In a short time the whole company knew where we were going . As I went On ahead of my company , I could hear an angry murmur and now and then an exclamation : ' This is sacrilege ! ' ' It will bring misery to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Must we dig up the dead ? ' ' Must we lake out the hones of the dead ? ' Every sent ence came like a blow on my head . At the same time we fell in with the throng in t he valley . We saw those who were unable to go on , who were weeping , or writhing in pain . We saw the wagons mired to the hubs in the deep mud , and it seemed to me that the men clustered round them had lost their reason , for t hey were shouting madly , and cruelly beating the poor exhausted horses . And then we came to those who were ( lying , and the dead lying in the ditches . Three regiments had crossed the river . They were trying to move on across the valley , but t he confusion and disorder in the throng was dismaying. could not endure it any longer . ' Bring me my horse ! ' I called to my orderly . After I had mounted I said to Cheda , ' I am going ahead to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cemetery . Take care that no one stays behind . ' spurred my horse so as to leave that hell as quickly as possible . lit I Iow beautiful was the cemetery ! How quiet it was there at Peaceful At the crest of the hill was a large rounded plateau , quite level . The old cemetery was on this plateau . It was like a park . Wide straight paths , strewn with yellow sand , went in all directions , and above them great linden trees formed beautiful arches . Between the paths were the graves , surrounded by low borders of evergreen , or old iron fences , with monuments of black or white marble , and a low seat of stones near each grave . At each grave there was a tiny lamp , in many of which red and yellow flames burned . And everywhere were many flowers and sweet odors . The citizens of Lescovatz had thought this hill-top would always be large enough for their comet ery ; but death had been busy in poor Serbia the last five years . Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all directions ; in this new part were hundreds and hundreds of ' new graves . There were no wide paths between these , nor high monuments of marble , nor iron fences . They were low mounds with simple wooden crosses ? the graves of soldiers . But still each grave had its lamp , and many of the flowers which grow so quickly from tears . I got off my horse , hitched him to a tree , and went to examine the locations where the trenches must . be dug . I went first . to t he south side where the trenches must face the pass . When I reached this place I wanted to cry out in great . joy . A wide path ran along the crest just where I must dig the trenches . Never in my life had I felt greater joy and relief . ' If only it would be the same on the other side ! ' I said aloud to myself , as in prayer . It was easy to establish the points where the trenches were to be dug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear ; the little wooden crosses at the new graves of soldiers below were almost innumerable . Lower down were vineyards and the little cabins of the vine-growers . It was a fine place for my trenches , Afterwards I rode across to the east side , facing the valley ; there all my joy THE GRAVEYARD BY THE MORAVA i 851 and hopes vanished . Not . only were there no paths , but the old and new cemeteries overlapped . While I was riding to the cemetery I had made up my mind that I In 118/ ( lest roy the graves . But now , when t he moment came that I must really do this I felt stunned , and my brain refused to act . A cold sweat broke out upon my body ; drops trickled clown my forehead into my eyes and stung them . Then the words of the colonel came to my mind : do not defend the dead but the living . ' I grasped this reason as a drowning man clutches at a straw . I examined t he ground where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would have to destroy five old graves and two new ones ; there , would have to dig up seven new and three old ones . But , after a while , I found a line between the graves , which , though not very strategic , would not cross many graves . Only four would have to be destroyed ; and of these three were old ; two were very old ? sunken , and so covered with grass as to be scarcely recognizable . The other old one was surrounded by a black iron fence , and a white marble monument stood near the mound , on which was chiseled in golden letters , " l'o our good Mama . ' l'here were many dead roses on the grave , but the beautiful crowns of the chrysanthemums were open . The new grave was that of a soldier . On the mound were many flowers , and a lamp which burned in its tiny white church . On the left side the earth was pressed down by being knelt upon . At the head of the grave was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Died of Wounds Received in the Battle of Kosmaj October 5 , 1515 I looked upon these two graves sadly . In one was lying a son , a soldier , a warrior , a defender of his native land . In the second a mother ? the dearest being , the most holy person to her children . It came over me that I must kneel before these graves and pray . But , suddenly I looked upon myself . I was dirty , disheveled , bloodstained . Men like me can not pray to God ! ' 1 said aloud . And I felt that it did not pay to live . By this time my company had arrived at the cemetery . The many experiences which thew men had known in their unending fighting had taught them where to go and what to do as soon as they came to a new situation . But.now they went hesitatingly , they stopped , they hid behind each other , and all sought to be in the rear line . They were frightened . ' Third and fourth platoons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t he south side . When we came to the path I said to them , ' You are lucky . You will not have to dig up the graves . The t reaches will go along the edge of this path . You will start at this monument and end beyond that tree . You must begin work right away and try to finish before dark . Go on , men , go on to work ! ' Afterwards I came back to the first . place . Some of the soldiers were going from grave to grave , reading the inscriptions and whispering among themselves . Many had laid down On the grass . Some were asleep . When I came , they all rose , and stood silently awaiting my order . It seemed to me that they stood before the last judgment . Bora and Cheda came to me . Listen ! ' I said to them . You will begin at this fence , dig over this new grave and those with white monuments , and end beyond the two old graves . Begin at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on ! ' The soldiers , with shovels on their shoulders , advanced slowly and hesitatingly and stood near each other on the line I marked out . A great hulloing fellow , tanned almost black , with bandaged head , the stock of whose gun bore more than thirty scratches ( each scratch meant that he had killed a man ) , stood over the soldier 's grave and with his heavy boot kicked at the earth or the mound and trampled the flowers . I would rather he had trampled on my heart . When the soldiers were all in line , Cheda said , Begin ! ' Each man bent and began to dig at . his place . Cheda came to the big soldier and quietly said to him , ' You must . not throw down the cross ! ' No fear , Sergeant , it ' s not in my way , ' replied the giant , and struck his shovel into the mound . I went a little farther and sat down on a bank , that I might not see . The sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crowns of the lindens whose yellow and faded leaves covered the paths and the graves . ' I'he trees and monuments made long shadows on the leaf-strewn ground , which looked like a beautiful carpet of a thousand colors , rosy with the gleam of the sunset . The little lamps on the graves began to shine more brightly and weirdly . At first . I heard only the strokes or picks and shovels behind 11W ; then the soldiers began to murmur , to talk , then to call to each other , to swear , and finally to laugh . I heard a voice . ' It is not so terrible to dig here . ' ' Surely , it is not .. The sexton does this all his life ! ' I recognized the voice as that of the giant who dug into the soldier 's grave . Eh ! How easy the shovel goes in this wet earth like into a cheese , ' said another . ' fit a cemetery the earth is always wet ? with tears ! ' I heard Bora 's voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a low , serious tone . ' Oh , yes ! dig ! dig ! ' replied Bora . It 's all the same . If we dig in the fields , pastures , vineyards , rocks , mountains , forests , or cemeteries , it is all the same ; everywhere we destroy human toil and God 's works . In every case we are sinners . In other places we throw out only stones , but here a skull . But . it is all the same anyway ; neither can speak , neither can feel . Dig ! dig ! ' Presently I saw an old man Who was trying to hurry toward us. lie was tillable to run , but he cried out something and made signs with his hands . I rose ( till met him at the trench . Ile was very , very old , his hair was all white , his eyes were wide with horror . Ile tried to speak , but he had lost his breath from hurrying and no words came . Ile gasped for breath a few moments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make them stop , then cried ,  --  ' What are you doing here , men ? ' Ca n't you see ? We 're digging trenches ! ' said ( lecla in a low angry voice . Ile hated to be interfered with . But in the cemetery ! ' exclaimed the poor old man . ' In nty cemetery ! Do n't you know that I have taken care of this cemetery more than forty years ? I swore before God that I would keep forever his holy things . I do not permit this . Do you understand ? I do not permit you to ( lig here ! It is impossible ! From a thousand other places you choose just , this to destroy ! ' ' Hey , eheecha , as far as you can see the t renches are dug everywhere round the town . Now understand ate , everywhere they ? ' began flora . ' I do n't care ! ' broke out the cheecha , angrily , to Bora . ' You can dig everywhere , you can destroy everything , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ' For a moment t here was silence . The soldiers stopped their work and watched to see what happened . The old sexton , seeing this , thought . that we had given up and said more gently , Thoide , ha/de dobri ? none . Fly from here ! ' " That 's impossible ; we are not birds , ' laughed a soldier . What ! you will not go from here ? YOU Will not leave toy graves in peace ? ' I beg of you , cheecha , go away , ' said Cheda sternly ; go , go at once , and get out of our way . ' And turning to the soldiers , he said , ' GO on digging . ' The men , who were amused at this scene , began to dig , laughing . When the poor old man saw this , he screamed as if he had been wounded , and rushing to the giant who was digging at the soldier 's grave , grasped his shovel with both hands , trying to take it away front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you shall not dig here while I am alive ! ' The big soldier , from whom the devil himself could not wrest anything , held the shovel in one hand ; with h the other he brushed away the old man , saying , Let me alone , checelm . Let me alone , I tell you If I had to defend such as you , certainly I would not destroy these graves ; but , ' pointing to the valley , for those down there , I would do anything ; for those I would die ! ' And , knowing that he was right , in his excitement he pushed the old man so hard that he fell to the ground . I hurried to them , crying , What are you doing , you fools ? ' Then , for the first time , the old man saw me . Ile crept to me , clasped my feet with his arms , and weeping , begged me : ? ' 0 sir ! sir ! I beg of you , if you know God , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't let them commit , a terrible sacrilege ! God will punish them ! ' I bent over him and said , 13e reasonable , cheecha , we have to dig here . This place is a very important strategic point . If we do not defend it , the Bulgarians will enter quick-ly into the town and do frightful things . Serbia is dying , cheecha , her people are perishing . NN'e have to do everything in order to save them . We must tal:e every help . The time is coming when we must take help of the dead too . Understand , the dead have to help its DOW ! ' The old sexton looked at me in amazement , as if he did not understand me . Suddenly his head drooped ; he fell to the ground and wept like a child . Cheda looked at me . I gave hint a sign with my head and he went to the soldiers . ' Two men here ! Take that old man and carry him to his home , and say to his wife , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once . ' Two soldiers lifted the old man , taking him under t he arms , and went on ' . The old sexton looked as if he were dead . After going a little distance , he jerked himself away from the soldiers , straightened up and cried in a solemn you 'd ' , - You have to know that you dig your own grave . God will punish you ! lie will bury you to-morrow ! ' Then suddenly he collapsed and fell into the arms of the soldiers , an inert mass . The men were laughing and calling , Oh , we know that ! ' We came here for t hat ! ' At least , we know that we will have a good sexton ! ' Be silent ! Work ! ' said Cheda , grily . Toe soldiers became quiet and began to work again . It seemed as if I had dreamed all this , that I was not alive . I felt as if the heart and soul had gone out of me and I had neither nerves nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The sun had set but it was still light . It was one of those beautiful last clays of autumn , which tell us that Nature will soon die , but also give promise of a new springtime , Alas ! the springtime will never come again to poor Serbia ! For a while I he soldiers worked quietly . They saw the night cooling , and as they knew that the trenches must be finished before dark , they used their last . strength hurriedly . Occasionally I heard a sad , tired sigh , the sigh of a loan who can no longer move . Then I would hear the voice of his friend : Go , go on , bale little brothed , Only for a little longer . We will have the whole night to rest ! ' Then I heard a st range noise of ninny voices calling ,  - -  - Roues ! ' How black and yellow they are ! ' Mow large I hey are !

Have you forgotten the days of CernaBarn , when we had to remain for fifteen days in our trenches , and around its lay the corpses which had rotted in the summer sun , because we could not . bury them ? Do you remember that ? ' I remember , but it was not . as ? ' It was worse , ' said Cheda angrily . ' It is not worth your while to complain . Better work ! Dig ! ' Again they were silent . Again only the stroke of the picks . Auhr cried a frightened voice . ' Bora , look here ! A skull ! ' A skull ! Throw it up here .

No actor would wish a bet ter stage . 13ut instead of applause , it is t he thunder of cannon . It is more magnificent ! And instead of laurels , perhaps I will get a bullet through my forehead . But it is all the same . This scene is worth death ! The story is , that a khedive , throwing away his loran and his ingiales , gave liberty to all his slaves and the wives of his harem . He stood before a window and saw how these unhappy ones joyfully breathed t he beautiful air of liberty . Never khedive saw a more magnificent picture ! Later , he committed suicide in the great delight of his heart , with these words on his lips , " These scenes will not happen every day . " A skull !

And yet , in these dark sockets were once eyes , like those of my mother , which wept with happiness when I smiled , or with pain when I but cut my little finger . Oh ! clear mother 's eyes !

It seemed to me that I wanted to listen to his words , to drink them in , ttml yet , at the same time , to close my ears to them . All the feelings which I had hidden and kept deep in my heart , this good boy , in his honesty and youth , had drawn out without pity . Never , never should one speak of mollwr in the war !
