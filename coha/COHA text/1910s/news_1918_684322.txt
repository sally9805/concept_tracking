txt Maud B. Booth 's Christmas Appeal . For years your readers have shown me a very kindly and generous interest in the little children of my boys in prison , and I want this year especially to appeal to their sympathy , for the need is as great as ever . The prison-shadowed homes are very sad places at what should bo the children 's happiest season . From his prison cell the father is powerless to help them . The mother has all she can do to buy food and pay rent . Often the little ones go poorty clothed and the , toys and joys that childhood covets are denied them . Every Christmas I have tried to play Santa Claus 's partner in these homes ; and in this way we have been able to lift the burden from the mothers ' shoulders and to bring real Christmas gladness to hundreds of little ones . May I ask your readers to remember this work and to send their gifts of money . clothing , or toys addressed to Mrs. Bailington Booth , Volunteers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want my plea to have special urgency , because I Alban be far away in France striving to bring a message of cheer to the boys of the American Expeditionary Forces . I do not want to feel that my work for the prisoners ' faint1163 has to suffer in my absence . I have a splendid staff of workers ready to do their part if the financial aid is forthcoming . I wish it distinctly understood that the Volunteers of America is a duly incorporated society , with our books all properly audited , and that our treasurer will send a receipt for every dollar received and will hold vouchers for every dollar expended . " Believe me , very cordially vows for God and country . MAUD B. Boum . New York , Dec. 1 , 191S.
