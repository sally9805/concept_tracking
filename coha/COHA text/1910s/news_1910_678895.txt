txt Instead of a decision of the Supreme Court on Monday regarding the Tobacco Trust the country got something " equally as good , " in the opinion of trust haters , an indictment of the Beef Trust . It was odd that on the same day prices of meat should have advanced , but that was a mere coincidence . The case is too serious for bravado . since it is not necessary to prove that the trust has done any harm to anybody . It is only necessary to show that it exists , and the law makes it guilty independently of its intentions or its acts . Its counsel puts out a statement that it controls only a small portion of the country 's meat trade , and that instead of restraining trade the business done shows that it has stimulated trade. , The indictment is not for these acts , but for restraining competition , although It was their own competition among themselves which they restrained . The trust might never have been formed if its members had been allowed to make agreements in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combined , and are in risk of punishment for combining , regardless of what they did as a " combine . " It is said that the effect of the trust 's punishment will be the contrary of that popularly desired . For economic reasons the trust has wished to shut some of its most expensively operated plants , but has not felt free to do so in the state of public opinion . This will now be done under compulsion of law , and the economies will more than meet any fine . The effect upon the price of meat is left obscure . so that some of the impatient may exclaim , " What 's the use ? " It is another coincidence that the highest court in Canada has rendered final judgment in a case on all fours with the Beef Trust case . The indictment of the Wholesale Grocers ' Guild covered acts running back to 1S98 . It was alleged that it had combined and conspired in restraint of trade , to limit production , and maintain prices , and lessen competition . No less than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in our Oil Trust case . There were over a thousand pages of evidence , 112 exhibits , countless letter books , and no suggestion that the ultimate facts were not uncovered . The course of business disclosed was such as is familiar to all business men . The conditions of the trade being unsatisfactory , they were remedied by getting together . Price cutting was the rule , and it was stopped , with the effect that business in staples  --  tobacco , starch , cereals , sugar , canned goods , and so on ? was made a source of profit instead of loss . Hence the prosecution . ? Will it be believed that the wicked - trust was discharged with a clean bill of health ? Chief Justice FALCO:IN/BRIDGE found that there was no intention to violate the law , and that the acts ware without malice . ' Missal was done was simply In pursuance " of a bona-fide desire to protect their own interests , and that of the wholesale grocery trade In general . " He remarked that the proceeding was not upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and spoke unfavorably of those persons who promoted the indictment by alleging oppression and driving out of trade , although their motive was to disorganize trade by selling at retail and claiming privileges as wholesalers . The trade had a right , ' the Chief Justice ruled , to organize itself , and to establish rules , and to equalize prices with reference to freight rates , and the effect was beneficial to the buyer in small quantities . There is no novelty in this . It was the law in all places living under the common law until the ' Sherman antitrust law was enacted . It is still the law in Canada , and is sustained as good business and good morals . The acts alleged were not denied , but It was set up that they were " reasonable , " that the effect was not to raise prices " unduly . " Those words are used repeatedly , both in the indictment and in the judgment , and the reasoning Is sustained by abundant citations of American opinions . American precedents relied upon to acquit the Canadian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People 's Gas Company of Chicago , and a California case . All are in line with the reasoning of the Beet Trust counsel , but they are not applicable to the defense of his clients . They are guilty because they are a. trust ? if they are a trust  --  and that is all there is about it . The Canadian reasoning is applicable to many other American cases than thel Beef Trust . People dearly love a price cutter , but the decision upholds the principle and practice of selling upon fixed prices , and other conditions imposed by the producers . They have their rights , and while consumers have their rights , a cut price is not one of them , or at least not a right to be enforced by indictment , and public prosecution . The building trade imbroglio reported yesterday is also within the reasoning asserted as Canadian , and sustained by American decisions quoted against ourselves . The men combined against the bosses complain that the bosses are combined against the men.i It would seem that both combinations are equally good or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It would seem that the men have no complaint if the bosses combined merely with respect to their own business , and without malice. , That would not be the case if they combined to prevent the men from finding employment in their trade In general , but it would seem otherwise if the lack of employment were . only that resulting from the rule regarding the employers ' own shops .
