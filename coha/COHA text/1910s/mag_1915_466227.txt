T must have occurred to many to explore the background ? of the 4 Freshman 's mind , but - in the midst of endless .71.4.11C discussions of preparatory schools , entrance examinations , and all the vast and creaking machinery of American secondary education I find little mention of it . Perhaps the results have seemed too confused for publication . Perhaps ? and this , as I sit and look at my Freshman class , I feel to be the true reason ? a fear of the blank and empty stretches which may be behind their agreeable faces , a dread of discovering just how little background the undergraduate does possess , has silenced the timorous pedagogue . Occasionally I nerve myself to overcome this hesitancy , prepare for shocks and disillusionments , apply my probe , and proceed to reach the minds of that Freshman class , which squirms and writhes as I proceed . They are not alto-gether discouraging , the results of that operation . I find much valuable and interesting material , even when I can not discover the intellectual equipment that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and doggerel has well-developed opinions on morality . He who describes the Puritans in terms of the Salvation Army is nevertheless a shrewd judge of human nature . And that quiet fellow in the corner , who belongs to a new and more intellectual America , names an opera , or a symphony , or a good hook with a familiarity which makes me blush for the crude rawness of my own days as an American undergraduate . But he is only one , and well-nigh everywhere else I find a bleak ignorance ? redeemed , sometimes , by shrewdness , persistence , and business ability , but lacking the sympathetic interest in knowledge and the arts whichshould he found in a boy who is ready to enter college . When we declare , after examination in a number of definite subjects , that a boy is ready to enter our institution , and then are displeased with the result , it is this deficiency in background , I think , i this poverty in intellectual interests , that makes the trouble . It is this that explains why so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strewn upon a hare and barren hinterland , and , finding no warmth to sprout in , no soil to root in , dries up and blows away . And if a liberal education dis-plays itself in so many college graduates as neither liberal nor an education , here is one cause that it is folly to neglect . I never fully appreciated the importance of the Freshman 's background until the exigencies of bachelor life lodged me for some years in the midst of a college dormitory . In those years I made what was , for me , a great discovery in undergraduate psychology . / learned that many a boy had gone through a long and expensive preparation for college with no perceptible effect on his interests ; nterests ; and this made me realize that a college course must possess and fructify those desert regions where the Freshman intellect pursues its nomadic way , or be a waste of time that might as profitably be spent at the movies " or the ball-game . It was a discouraging conviction for a young and hard-worked teacher ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so of us living in a kind of prairie-dog settlement about a great central living-hall on which all our rooms opened . I was proctor , but under the influence of a common living-room the rigid barriers which separate the teacher and the taught weakened , and sometimes broke down . There were talks while we shaved , informal calls in dressing-gown or sweater , and ( for better evidence ) conversations outside my closed door , where the Freshman revealed himself to the reflective instructor with startling clarity : It was a highly differentiated gathering : West , East , South , and many schools had contributed to my family . One is a writer of rising distinction now , another a mining-engineer , a third a successful business man , a fourth ( 1 should judge ) one of the pillars of the Tenderloin . As their divergent careers indicate , they differed as much , one from another , as boys can differ , which is only a little less than men ; and yet one statement could he made for nearly all : the sympathies , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among their schoolmates had little to do with the things they had learned at school . It was the first that made their background . It was there that they were living . The second ? their formal training ? was held in suspension , waiting , and often waiting vainly , to pass into the life processes . The gulf between their thought and i their so-called education showed itself only too clearly . Sometimes the talk would go for hours after endless hours of trivialities of " prep-school " gossip , second-hand comment on college athletics , wearisome disputes as to who said this or who said that , in which no one was interested ? without a suggestion of the new ideas that college was supposed to be giving them . But this was merely the reticence or the fatigue of active spirits . Often enough , if personality came into the discussion , or prejudice , or achieve-. ments that touched their imaginations , they would take fire ; and when I talked with them alone , it was seldom that some vitality of interest did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , commercial , for I tried them all ? they were not interested . i It was in these talks that I came to understand the magnitude of the teacher 's problem . Thanks to the narrowness of their interests , the subject-matter of civilization ? history , literature , science ? was not at home in their minds . They received instruction as the Eskimo receives the arts of the white man ? politely , but with some suspicion and not a little contempt . And yet , unless our teaching entered into and became a part of their backgrounds it did not livebeyond the cooling of the breath . I quickly discovered that the lesson which touched no chord of previous sympathy had to fight all the forces of youthful indifference , and speedily dropped away . I soon learned that a quickening appre-ciation was due as much to some old influence which time had welded into the brain as to the teacher who awoke it . And when there was nothing to work upon we worked in vain . The banker 's son from New York was clear- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his life amid ideals of profit and physical pleasure.The moral philosophy of English literature shed from his brain like water from a roof . The son of the Montana miner had a heart of gold and common sense worth millions , but he had come from an over-practical world which recognized the abstract only when it was sentimental . Thought about religion or atoms or politics or poetry passed through his head and left never a path behind it . And there was one youth , by no means the most intel-lectual , or even the most likable , who seemed to clinch the argument . He , it seemed , had lived in a family where food , business , reprimand , and complaint had not been the only topics of conversation . His mind was stored with vague inter-ests in politics , science , art , vague ambitions toward knowing " why things were so , " and how to control them ; interests and ambitions worthless in themselves because of their very vagueness . He knew nothing definite , he could do nothing well , he had always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so he thought , and with justice , mediocre . Nevertheless , that boy was getting educated while the rest of them were merely being trained . From his position of inferiority he was advancing , and he advanced , abreast of and then beyond them . It may have been delayed ability . I do not think so . It was rather that , thanks to the sympathies which had been rooted in his mind , his thoughts were hospitable to education . I doubt whether he . has made as much money as the rest of them . He lacked shrewdness for that . But I know that he got more from his education ; and I think that he is doing more with his life . That boy had background ? a background not so much of knowledge and experience , though all that he had was valuable , as of awakened intellectual desires . The others , with slight exceptions , had not . It did not make them less excellent fellows to know and to live with . It did not affect their common sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting to talk to : for once outside a narrow range of athletics , travel , or mutual acquaintances , they did not react . And , oh , what a difference when it came to educating them ! It was painful to know that , failing to reach the distant background where the boy was living , our ardor was flung away for trivial results . But at least it explained the many , many disappointments , and nerved one to assault more intelligently the well-guarded citadel where lurked the minds of the Freshman class . I had been too recently an undergraduate myself to feel rancor . It seemed the established order that a boy should come to college keenly alive to its social possibilities , and indifferent to ideas and to culture . It seemed a notable triumph for the university when I considered how many men of my college generation had emerged with minds that were sweetened , made liberal , filled full of useful interests , and ready to discriminate among the values of life . I praise my university a little less now that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not , perhaps could not , do for us . But against the " established order " and its self-satisfied indifference I am in revolt . Why should the universities have to take over from good schools and comfortable homes so much sodden clay into which only a new creation could put the breath of intellectual life ? Why should they have to press their wares upon the unwilling student like patent-medicine venders ? Ts it fair , is it honest , is it wise to send them boys who might want education , yet do not ; who might be interested in knowledge , yet are not ; whose habit of mind is opposed to all cultivation not directly associated with elementary pleasure or dollars and cents ? The critics say , If you gave them an education adapted to modern life they would not be indifferent to it . Alas ! if in the intellectual loafers among our undergraduates I could discover an interest in any kind of education , I should be more optimistic . I am not complaining of the preparation of our undergraduates , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is our problem . I freely admit that the schools might teach them more , and I know , of course , that better educational methods would enrich their backgrounds as well as increase their knowledge . Indeed , I see a dozen instances in my Freshman classes where this has been true , especially among boys who have been sub- . jected to the superior discipline and richer education of a European school . The trouble fundamentally is not here ? . it is in the home . In an earlier essay I pointed out , with as much restraint as the ruffled spirit of a weary teacher would permit , that the parents who sent their boys to college to " make a society " and become " good mixers " were unjust , then and afterward , to the boys and to the college . They are also chiefly to blame , these parents , for the weak and pallid background of the undergraduate . And it is in the home that children learn a bad philosophy of getting educated . To speak of a " philosophy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foolish as it sounds . The Freshmen , consciously or unconsciously , have a very definite attitude toward " learning things , " and that attitude is their philosophy . Try them and you will quickly find that they have taken their stand already as regards " culture " and " mental discipline , " just as they have taken their stand in moral matters . I do not refer to what they say . The undergraduates will maintain as one man that " culture " is desirable . The most flagrantly epicurean and wilfully Philistine members of my class will cheerfully assert in writing , and over their signatures , that from the bottom of their hearts they believe " a man ought to broaden his mind by studying a number of subjects " in college . And the laziest Senior , after an evening at a cafe " or the " movies , " will stroll over to the class polls next morning , humming " In this college life there is rest , " and cheerfully vote that Phi Beta Kappa was what he most desired in college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as indicated by what they do . And it is not usually the school that makes the striking differences which will appear ? differences ranging from a warm and fruitful appreciation to a dull and indifferent spirit . It is the philosophy which they drew from their background ? which is to say , from their environment , and most of all their homes . American parents might echo the regretful words of King Lear , who had " ta'en too little care " of the social errors ripening before his unseeing eyes . Like " big business , " and the exploiters of our natural resources , they let the period of excessive individualism now drawing to a close lead them into serious errors of omission and commission . In the nineteenth century religious education in the home , with the incidental culture that accompanied it , began to decline . Its place was taken by an almost superstitious faith in the power of the college and the school . Thousands of American parents , who professed to desire cultivation for their sons and daughters , chose ? through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shifted their responsibility upon formal education . The mother was busy learning the ways and means of the new luxury which in the ' 8o 's began to be obligatory for socially ambitious Americans ; the father was still busier , earning the wherewithal for the process . Both , in many instances ? I judge by results ? gladly welcomed these insidious theories of individualism in education . Let us put the boy in a good school , they said , where of course he will become educated . Then , having spared no expense in the effort to give him the best in the market , they washed their hands of the whole affair , and , unless he was dropped or expelled , concerned themselves no more with the matter . The result is the college problem of to-day ? a profusion of well-dressed , well-mannered boys , fairly well-trained , fairly well-stocked in mind , but devoid of any active interest whatever in their education . The mistake was to suppose that a school alone could give them background . By what miracle of education could these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be endowed in the schools with the thingthat all their early environment had taught them to neglect or despise ! It was too late . Instruction , like a thunder-storm above rocky summits , rumbled and burst upon their impervious heads , and only the mental habits of their boy companions , with minds as immature as their own , really influenced their ways of thinking . Thus at school they lived in a barbarous age of their own and their friends ' creating , where light , learning , and scientific truth were viewed much as the Crusaders , who stamped Greek bronzes into coin and burned marbles for lime , regarded the beauty and the civilization of ancient Constantinople . The laissez-faire method , as I have described it , may have increased self-confidence , favored manliness , and saved time and worry for the American parent , but as a cultural process it was thoroughly inefficient . Well , what is to be done about it ? Let us suppose that we want culture , by which I mean no mere affectation of knowledge , nor any power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of art and literature , but , rather , an intelligent interest in the possibilities of living . Indeed , there is no raison d'ilre for the college of liberal arts if there is no such desire . Well , what is to he done ? Buy a library , redecorate the living-room , adopt the broad a , enter the whole family in the nearest summer school , and take the boys to " GattereUmmerung " instead of to the ball-game ? Such a method of providing a background in a hurry has been tried , with results that our native playwrights have failed to grasp only because their fondness for melodrama has dulled their sense of humor . And yet even a college professor can see remedies ? partial , to be sure , yet remedies that will bring relief . The first is to be honest . If you are content with an education for your children that gives a certain amount of superficial information , to be acquired while they are making friends , advancing socially , and preparing to come out of college good " mixers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then , be honest about it , teach them to be honest , and do not deceive yourself or them into supposing that it is culture you are after , or culture that they have got For some undergraduates this is the best , indeed it is the only course , though for most it is perdition . Some minds can absorb , and some will absorb , no more than a certain measure , even though deans and j faculties and educational journals rage . Once they get into college , one must make the best of them . The college will suffer . But then education has always had to carry dead weight , and will continue to do so until some new economic order makes it necessary for every one to work for a living . If the lazy-minded are honest , they are not dangerous ? one learns to accept them , like humidity and flies . It is the men who are not honest that corrupt college life , the men who wish to turn college into a social institution and call that culture , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or into a mold of character or good manners , and call that intellectual training . If they were honest with themselves , if you were honest with them , they could not be so deluded . They would either frankly admit that their goal was not intellectual development , and so become less dangerous ; or turn more of their admirable energies into training the mind , and so become really valuable ; or stay away from college . I do not believe that many men are the worse for their college course , since our undergraduate life has a wonderful vigor and sweetness , which enriches often where it does not educate . It is the colleges that suffer . Of course there are many fathers ? especially among business men ? who frankly do not believe in culture , and who are quite willing that their children should get the associations of college life with the modicum of cultivation which can not be escaped . I have another and equally serious quarrel with them , which demands more space than this essay can afford . They at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distrust of the intellectual fops and dryas-dust pedants who will sometimes develop as excrescences upon the cultural process . Or , if not prejudice , it is a wilful ignorance of what the colleges mean by culture that misleads them , and a wilful blindness to the kind of intellect which will be required of the next generation . But my quarrel here is with the parents who profess to believe in college education . If , being such a parent , you are not content with the ambiguous training desired by the advocate of " country-club i colleges " ; if you belong to the new generation which has begun to realize that the complexities and competitions of modern life are crying for intelligence to master them , and that even millions are growing difficult to spend ; if you demand a training for your children that will stir the inner virtues of the mind ? why , then , two courses are open . Granted schools and colleges as good as one can provide ? and they are not yet good enough for the splendid material that America is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addition , either i background , with all it implies , or a heartfelt desire for education . Now it should not be difficult to give the current Freshman a proper background.Colleges in America have spread with incredible rapidity . Rut they have spread no faster than the homes where all the appliances of civilization are at hand . The background of culture , thanks largely to our women , is available in many , if not in most , families of moderate means . But , unfortunately , it is not yet our background . We are a little restive before it ? suspicious of its refinements , contemptuous of its luxuries . It is like a new fashion , worn awkwardly , scornfully , by practical men , if worn at all . And the hearty young barbarians , who always imitate those they love best , magnify our suspicions , our contempts , and go off i to school and college with that for their intellectual and esthetic philosophy . It is hard at middle age to broaden tastes , to become interested in thought , to learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living that a good income and the twentieth century put before us . And yet , if the children are to be given a fair start in the more intellectual period that is certainly coming , the effort must be contemplated . Unless they are strong enough to break away from their first environment ? and many are not ? school alone will never bring culture with it , nor will college . The families who lack the apparatus and the atmosphere of fine living , whether through the hampering poverty of a tenement flat or the distracting riches of a new-made million , are handicapped , perhaps , but in no sense deprived of the opportunity to give education a fair chance . They may nor he able to insure for their children a background rich in experience of the arts of life , but they can inculcate the desire for one ; and in youth , desire is even better than possession . There may be bad pictures on the wall , cheap hooks on the shelves , narrow talk or none at all at table , and yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surer of awakening his intellectual being than the son of an art-collector or a patron of symphony concerts ? if he really wants to be educated . Neither poverty nor riches is the determining factor . In either case , the wish to know truly and to feel truly can be instilled , if there is the will to instil it . And such a longing wins against any odds . In one respect , at least , the youth who must fight his way out of utter Philistinism , or the barren environment of the poor , is better off than he who enters college already acquainted with the liberal arts . He has rubbed , and rubbed hard , against the basic necessities of life  - -  need of food , need of clothes , need of money ? or at least his parents have made him familiar with those incorrigible realities which came before the arts and will stay after them . And the saving practicality that comes with hard-earned sustenance , and remains when the stress and the pinch are past , will save him from the poses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily won , and make it ? what all culture seems to many Americans ? an ornament , rather than an aid to a richer and more purposeful life . There is no getting round it . If we wish the colleges to instil culture , we must either become cultivated ourselves , or by some other means make our children desirous of culture . Even so , the problem will not be solved . Inefficient teachers will remain to be reckoned with , especially since we shall probably continue to refuse to give them enough income to keep what culture they possess at the boiling-point . And there are few schools and few colleges in which outworn , ineffective methods do not here and there hold back even the willing mind from a full measure of accomplishment . The sociologist will remark that there is also heredity . It is still true that you can not make a silk purse out of a sow 's ear , and as there are boys who would become educated in Greenland or Nigeria , so , as I have already admitted , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , strive as we may . But the psychologists and anthropologists now give us reason to believe what common sense has long taught ? that the power of environment , if not absolute , is at least greater than any other shaping influence upon the mind . Environment can not make , though it may mar , genius or even talent ; but a bad heredity will not prevent a boy in a favorable environment from acquiring an adequate education . A far more serious problem is to determine just what true culture is going to be for the next generation , so that the bewildered parent may adequately prepare for it . Few will agree as to its probable nature , and in the particular forms of education and environment by which we try to instil it there is abundant room for legitimate differences of opinion . But no one will deny , I think , that a mind eager to get at the truth and willing to enjoy the best is a chief requisite in any conceivable educational programme .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
