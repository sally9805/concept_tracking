Harvard Studies in Comparative Literature . Vol . IV : Medieval Spanish Allegory . By Chandler Rathf on Post . Cambridge : Harvard University Press . $2.50 net . When Mrs. Malaprop referred to " an alwhat constituted an allegory were only a little more confused than those of most writers who attempt to deal with the subject to-day . It is gratifying , then , to feel that this baffling literary type , at least in a portion of its history , has at last received competent treatment . Hard as it may be for us , in the midst of these stirring times , to turn our minds back to a subject which seems as remote as " Medieval Spanish Allegory , " we must needs give to this book of Professor Post 's the importance that attaches to a pioneer in a new field . For in spite of the impulse lent in late years by Bruneti  --  re and others to the study of the " dvolotion des genres , " this is really the first book to trace in any country the evolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to refer to as " allegory or worse . " Besides giving us for the first time a survey of the special field of Spanish allegory , this new book succeeds also in quite revolutionizing our ideas of the relation of Spanish literature in general to French and to Italian . Hitherto , scholars have almost invariably spoken of Spanish literature down to the time of " Don Quixote " as chiefly under the influence of Italy . Wherever they found allegory , for example , they would exclaim at once , " imitation of Dante . " But now comes Professor Post to show that this allegorical strain was due not so much to Italian influence as to the vast reservoir of French allegory which was the common source for the allegory of Italy and Spain alike . If Italian imitation there is in Spain , it comes rather from the later Renaissance as a subsidiary influence . This is shown not merely in the case of allegory , but also in other forms of literature , and even in architecture , sculpture , and painting . So that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of importance to all who are interested in the larger aspects of the comparative study of the three chief Romance literatures . In the section of his book entitled The Evolution of Medieval Spanish Allegory , Professor Post attempts the very difficult task of tracing the gradual growth of allegory in Spain through a period covering some twelve centuries . He declares " the tendency to allegorize is as deep-rooted in the Iberian peninsula as in any other district of Europe . " The earliest attempts at Christian allegory are to be found in that mystical poet of the fourth century , Prudentius , the Spanish contemporary of Saint Augustine . Throughout the Middle Ages , we see in the Spanish peninsula , as well as in the rest of Europe , examples of those curious visions of the other world . Thus in the seventh century the Spaniard Paulus Emeritanus gives an account of the vision of a young acolyte who is borne up to the garden of paradise . Among other such visions , Saint Valerius relates one of a monk who images himself plunged into the cavern of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where Satan sits enchained. followed by the earliest of Spanish writers in the vernacular , Berceo . In his " Vida de Santa Oria , " for example , he tells us how the maiden Oria was borne up in a. vision to heaven , where she saw a throne prepared for her . Such journeys to the other world suggest Dante , but as Berceo died at the very time of Dante 's birth , his visions , as well as the medieval Latin ones , are an indication that no influence of the " Divine Comedy " from Italy is necessary to account for such visions on Spanish soil . By the fourteenth century , various allegorical personifications have gradually grown up within the setting of these visions . In his journey to Hell and to Heaven , the visionary sees , on the one hand , the Seven Deadly Sins , and , on the other hand , the Seven Virtues  --  which those who are not fond of this sort of allegory may be tempted to entitle similarly the Seven Deadly Virtues . In another vision , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear . Elsewhere it is Love that is personified , as in the famous " Libro de Buen Amor " of Juan Ruiz , that extraordinary Archpriest of Hita , who in some of the satirical touches of his allegory shows himself a Spanish counterpart of Chaucer . Thus within the framework of the mediaeval visions that were at first exclusively religious , secular allegory gradually found its way . Curiously enough , Professor Post speaks as though allegory had only later assumed the vision form . He says ( p. 7 ) ? " As by constant manipulation allegorical composition acquired greater artistic excellence , the custom became more general of adorning it with a visionary framework . " As a matter of fact , just the opposite seems to have been the case . It was within the visionary framework that these allegories grew up , and it was only later , when the setting which had been essential to the earlier vision was no longer needed , that the device of the vision was discarded . In the light of his own evidence Professor Post 's statements on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need some modification . In the fifteenth century , with the writers of the court of Juan II , we reach the heyday of Spanish allegory . It is in the allegories of this period that previous critics have emphasized , perhaps over-emphasized , the Italian influence . Imperial was the son of an Italian , and in him and in the more illustrious Marquis of Santillana , they have pointed to many " Dantesque imitations . " Professor Post , in his desire to minimize the pretended Italian influence , argues that these are not imitations of Dante , but rather of Dante 's precursors in Spain , such as Berceo But this seems hardly probable . No less an authority than Fitzmaurice-Kelly , in his " History of Spanish Literature " ( p. 53 ) , has said : " The chances are that Berceo and his writings had passed out of remembrance within two hundred years of his death , and he was evidently unknown to Santillana in the fifteenth century . " Now , Dante , on the other hand , seems to have been well known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visions . Indeed , in three of the visions  --  the " Decir de las Siete Virtudes " of Imperial , the " Triunfo del Marquez " of Diego de Burgos , and the Panegyric on the death of Alonso Carillo by Diego Guillen de Avila  --  it is Dante himself who plays the role of the guide that Virgil had played in the Divine Comedy . Dante has evidently been a guide to them in more senses than one , and it can hardly be denied that these Spanish writers of the fifteenth century show at least as much familiarity with the " Divine Comedy " as they do with the medieval visions in their own earlier literature . When Professor Post , after insisting that the native Spanish tradition is sufficient in itself , brings forward the apparently contradictory thesis that it is the French rather than the Italian influence which is most important , it becomes clear that he is trying to prove too much . From the rich variety of Spanish allegories of the fifteenth century there are two types that seem to stand out as peculiarly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that demand particular attention here . One of these , which describes the coronation of some famous man by allegorical figures , is usually designated by the Spanish title " CoronaciOn . " The other , which describes the sufferings of famous lovers in a sort of allegorical hell , we may refer to as the " Infierno de los Enamorados . " Both these types , characteristic as they are of the early Renaissance , still show traces of the medieval visions of Heaven and Hell from which they developed . For in the " Coronation " the author imagines himself as borne up in a vision to Heaven , where he beholds the rewards of fame ; while in the " Infierno de los Enamorados , " on the contrary , he imagines himself as conducted to Hell , where he beholds the tortures of love . The " CoronaciOn , " according to Professor Post , may have been suggested by medieval Spanish poems on the Coronation of the Virgin , or by visions in which saints receive crowns . Santillana himself had written a poem in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beholding there amid the nine orders of angels the canonization of a Dominican and a Franciscan saint . As Santillana developed this theme , however , it is not the glorification of a saint that he sees in his vision , but that of a poet . In his " CoronaciOn de mossen Jordi , " for example , he describes the famous Catalan poet , Jordi de Sant Jordl , as crowned by the goddess Venus at the request of the shades of Homer , Virgil , and Lucan . In another poem , Santillana in a vision finds his illustrious precursor , the poet Villena , mourned by the nine muses on the top of Parnassus . When we compare such Coronaci6ns with the ear-her religious visions from which they sprang we can not help being struck by the transition from the Middle Ages to the Renaissance that has already taken place . Instead of the Christian machinery of Hell , Purgatory , and Heaven , we find the appearance of pagan mythology . The canonization of a saint has given place to the coronation of the poet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muses Paradise has been replaced by Parnassus . When Santillana lavished in this way praises upon the poets who had died before him , one can not help feeling that he may not have been without the hope that some similar tribute might be paid to him . If so , he was not destined to be disappointed ; for after his death no less than three CoronaciOns were written in his honor  --  one by his nephew , Gomez Manrique ; one by his secretary , Diego de Burgos , and one by Juan de Mena , " the great Cordoban poet , " as Cervantes calls him , whose panegyric on Santillana is perhaps the highest achievement of this type of allegory . The glorification of the poet is a characteristic of the end of the Middle Ages throughout Europe . The coronation of the successful poet at the " Puys " in France , the coronation of Petrarch with laurel on the Capitol at Rome , are but counterparts of the Spanish allegory of crowning the poet The same desire of the poet for fame which is illustrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in England by Chaucer 's " House of Fame " was in Spain represented by the " CoronaciOn . " The " Infierno de los Enamorados , " or , as Professor Post seems to prefer to call it , the " Erotic Hell , " was the second type of allegory that particularly flourished in fifteenth-century Spain . As with the " Coronaci6n , " here again it is the illustrious Marquis de Santillana who has established this new type of allegory . In his " Infierno de los Enamorados " Santillana imagines in his vision that he is rescued from a wild beast by Hippolytus and led through a dark valley to a gloomy castle where he sees the tortures of unhappy lovers . Just as the " CoronaciOn " celebrated the famous poets , so this second form gave occasion to celebrate the famous lovers . The germ of both ideas may be found already in Dante , in the first two circles of his " Inferno . " For in Limbo he encounters the illustrious poets in a meadow of fresh verdure , and in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , blown about by the gusts of the " bufera infernale . " But scenes which had been in Dante but passing episodes in the whole tremendous scheme of punishment were developed by Petrarch and Boccaccio into elaborate compositions in themselves . As Petrarch 's " Triumph of Fame " offers an analogy to the " CoronaciOn , " so his " Triumph of Love , " where the lovers are cast into prison , furnishes an analogy to the " Infierno de los Enamorados . " Similar counterparts of the two types might be found in Boccaccio 's " Amorosa Visione " and in his " Corbaccio " or " Laberinto d'Amore . " In Spain , the peculiar forms that these two types of allegory took  --  the glorification of the poet and the glorification of the lover ? gave expression to that passion for glory and that pride which characterized the Spanish Hidalgo in the days before Cervantes had " smiled Spain 's chivalry away . " There was never a time that the Spaniard had more reason for this pride than in the fifteenth century . Towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw the united Spaniards bring their seven-hundredyear struggle against the Moor to an end with the conquest of Granada saw also the beginnings of Spain 's long glories across the sea with the conquest of the new world by Columbus . In that same year , too , a Spaniard became Pope , and it was not many years later that another Spaniard was to become Emperor . It was in such proud days as these , when Spanish galleons were first beginning to bring back gold out of a western empire upon which the sun never set , that Spanish allegory , with its passions for personal fame , flourished in all its richness . To-day , when the last vestiges of that western empire have been torn away from Spain , it is interesting to turn back once more to her former glory as it is reflected in the literature which Professor Post 's new book has revealed to us . In spite of some serious defects in arrangement and some hasty conclusions , it gives us the best sur vey we have of the evolution of Spanish allegory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the relations of that literature to French and Italian . It should be a matter of no small pride to America that Americans have done so much for the study of Spanish literature . The first satisfactory History of Spanish Literature was that given by George Ticknor , which , unlike any other literary history , still holds its place today , some sixty-six years after it was written . If , in the excitement of the Spanish War , some of us may for the moment have lost sight of the greatness of the earlier Spanish culture , it is some recompense to see since then the growth in America of the Hispanic Museum and the production of such scholarly works as Professor Rennert 's " Life of Lope de Vega , " and now this volume on " Mediaeval Spanish Allegory " by Professor Post . AN IMPRESSIONIST IN BELGIUM . The Spell of Belgium , . By Isabel Anderson Boston : The Page Co. $2.50 net . Following the volume on " The Spell of Flanders " is this companion in the series , on Belgium  --  chiefly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American Minister , Hon. Larz Anderson , had been in Belgium but a few months of 1911-12 , when her husband 's appointment as Ambassador to Japan compelled both to leave the country for the Far East . Her present work is in succession to that from her pen on " The Spell of Japan . " So far as they present her experiences and impressions in Belgium , her chapters are chiefly reminiscent of her life in Brussels , with motor-car visits to various places both in the Walloon highlands and on the Flemish plain . One may look in vain for evidences of any close acquaintance with the life of the Belgian people , though her view is ever that of kindly sympathy . In an overcrowded country , even before the desolations of war , the struggle for life seemed to be keener than ever , but of the charm and spell which this land of art and legend , of Van Eyck and Rubens , cast upon her , there can be no doubt . It is with a sympathetic pen , and in fascinating literary style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glories or catalogues the woes of a nation  --  so often crushed , yet so often resurgent . Since the previous volume in the series covered Flanders or northern Belgium , inhabited chiefly by the Flemish , of Teutonic origin , who speak rather an old form of Dutch , one would naturally expect , in this work , to find much about the southern or Walloon half of the country and its inhabitants , who are of Gallic strain and who speak French . Should not this be the main object of the author 's thought and description ? No one can really understand the Belgian people who does not clearly discriminate between the Walloons  --  at whose initiative nearly every one of the national movements has taken place  --  and the Flemings , who are the conservatives . The former furnish also a majority of the Socialists and the radical leaders , while the latter are , in the main , still unquestioning adherents of the Church and her traditions . Yet in this work we find very few discriminating references to the Walloons , or to the striking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that both ethnic and geographic conditions in RnlQinm h n vo from thA dawn of history conditioned and still influence the development of both country and people . In the three opening chapters , devoted to legation and court life in Brussels the Magnificent , we have perhaps the best view yet afforded readers of English of the procedure of royalty at this rather democratic court . Then , hieing to days mediaval , the author gives us animated verbal pictures of the politics , industries , and civic life , the memories of which the Belgians cherish so tenaciously . Here democracy , based on industrialism and long antedating England 's , first arose in northern Europe . Before its peaceful onslaught , feudalism gave way . From the first , Belgic civic life was strong . The oldest charter in Europe , given to the citizens of Grammont in 1068 , which granted civic rights in an age of battle-axe law , ushered in the new day . After that a congeries of city republics grew up . From this root of charters and guaranteed rights of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberty has ever drawn life and vigor . Even the so-called Protestant Reformation was largely the direct result of economic factors . This development of municipal vigor bore fruit in America . Out of the Walloons ' Land , or Southern Belgium , came the refugees from Spanish despotism , men , women , and children , the real settlers and initial home-makers , who first settled New York , New Jersey , Pennsylvania , and Delaware . Before the Revolution , all the first chartered cities , except Annapolis , Md. , within the limits of the present United States , were of Netherlandish origin and mostly between Manhattan Island and the Delaware . The historic spell does not seem to lie on the author , for neither the fact that our Middle region was Nova Belgica , nor that there are manifold points of contact between Belgic and American history , is noticed in her pages . Chapters on politics , industries , tapestries , paintings , and the modern literary situation delight us , but there is little evidence of her acquaintance with the people or the real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Belgian nationality as against Spanish , Austrian , Dutch , or German oppressors . In place of these things , naturally expected after the book on Flanders had appeared , we have several chapters of legends . These are more or less interesting , though most of them are already well known . As regards the new version of the Antwerp legend , we feel as conservative towards the orthodox form as a nursery child who discerns a variation from the fairy tales as at first related . We confess to liking the old version of Brabo , the killer of the giant Antigonus , and the " hand werpen , " or throwing , better than the less known one here reproduced , which , in spite of its alleged Flemish origin , has a very modern sound . The chapter on Politics and Plural Voting is very clear and very interesting , but from a somewhat closer acquaintance with the country and people , we think Mrs. Anderson underrates the Dower and influ ence of the Socialists . She ignores utterly the small numbers but potent influence of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spain have , despite clerical tyranny allied to state power , kept alive their organization . One-fifth of the book , comprising one long chapter entitled The Last Word , is taken up with first-hand narratives of the woes and desolation of the German invasion . With the author ( p. 355 ) " we feel sure that the spell of its Belglum 's enchantment will survive . " As regards holiday dress , indexing , co -- pious illustration , and resplendence of outward appearance , the volume is worthy of a king 's welcome .
