txt Case Against the Barnard Statue . Your readers should be grateful to THE TIMES for publishing Howard Russell Butler 's ringing letter about the Lincoln statue . Mr. Butler is a hustler , and if he will take the Iead in starting a popular subscription we can send a copy of the Saint-Gaudens statue to London . It seems to me that the chief reason for discarding the Barnard statue has not been sufficiently emphasized . It is that it is not an adequate portrait . Lincoln 's neck was not like that of a turtle , and he had hands . not paws ; and his figure , even if tall and ungainly , was not like that of Barnard 's statue . Among the two best examples of the genius of Saint-Gaudens are tile statues of two seafaring men  --  the Farragut statue in Madison Square and the statue of Captain Randall at the Sailors ' , Snug Harbor . The former 15 a portrait , and as such was approved by Loyal ! Farragut , the Admiral 's son , and by many others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason tha.ti the sculptor had no portrait or description of Captain Randall . who had been dead for many years . It is necessarily an ideal conception , and as such is an admirable and satisfying work of attt . But would Saint-Gaudens have been justified In setting up the Randall statue as a representation of Farragut on the ground that It was his conception of a sailor of the highest type ? The question needs no answer . For the same reason it is unnecessary to determine whether the Barnard statue is a noble conception or not , or even whether It has high artistic merit or not . The Barnard statue should be rejected. , and may be rejected solely on the ground that we have Irrefutable evidence In photographs taken from life and in the testimony of many who knew the man that Barnard 's statue  --  at least below the head  --  does not depict Abraham Lincoln as he was .
