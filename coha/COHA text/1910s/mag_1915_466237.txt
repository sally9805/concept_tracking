WHEN a man goes southward through the Gauls ? and best of all on foot ? he goes through one district after another which , though varying from garden to pas-tures , from pastures to deserted upland moors and back to gardens again , pass from one into the other with little of abrupt transition . The forests he passes through , though ancient , are orderly . Even the dead volcanoes of the central knot are guardians rather than lords of the flats below them ; and as he comes down their farther slopes to the sheet of vineyards along the southern rivers he has everywhere found the many landscapes of his journey maintaining a certain scale , moderate and apt to the high civilization of France . He has seen nothing awful ; he has been ar-rested by nothing tremendous in nature ; he will rather remember the works of man ; for France ( save for the marshy gate to the northeast ) is everywhere in-closed by mountains or sea , and within that inclosure is a habitation for men . But at last from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the valley of the Garonne or of the Adour , or from that great Domitian Way which was the earliest triumph of Rome outside her Italian boundaries , he will perceive the sunlit sky in the south to be distin-guished by a high and not uneven line , faint but continuously discernible throughout all the stretch of the hori-zon ; and all below this line is of a graver , mistier tint of blue . This broad , faint belt , lifted high and seemingly separate from the world , he may take for a very distant and singularly changeless bank of cloud ; it has the even texture and the distance of a cloud in still air , and it comes too much against heaven for him to think of it at first ( after so many hundred miles of undulating fields ) as being anything but of the sky . But that line does not move ; and as he still goes southward through the day it still stands unchanging between him and the sun . It is lost only to the left and to the right in infinities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadows against its universal gray that if it is not the bank of cloud it seemed , it must be a giant 's wall rising sheer up out of France . That line is the Pyrenees . 1 saw it thus when first I went out ten years ago with the intention of discovery . I had then , in seeing what so many millions have seen in just this sudden fashion , an experience as novel as a landfall , as fresh as the finding of an unknown world . And there is something about this ordered , even , and unchanging height which , though I have repeated that experience now very often and in varied seasons , forbids it ever to lose its original appeal . I could almost say that everything I have known grows stale except good verse and the Pyrenees . This great rampart runs unbroken from the sea to the sea for two hundred and fifty miles . So even is it that no break or saddle cuts it ? as the Alps are cut continually , as the Carpathians everywhere . The paths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough , rise up with the mountain slopes into the sky . When a man wanders into the heart of the chain he must climb on to the ridge of it and there find no more than a notch or neck but slightly bitten below the higher ridge on every side . Save for the broad Cerdagne , chiseled widely southward out of the mass from the summit , every way over the Pyrenees is by a little nick in their heights , not one by a gulf marring their continuity . So much for the main matter of this range . It is , what so many other ranges have with less justice been called , a wall . It contains and it forbids . I wish I could put here in written words what perhaps the modern camera skilfully used might do for me , and what surely some great landscape-painter should long ago have done for this amazing thing ? I mean the sense of command , of an ordered halt , and of a sheer limit which it imposes . Nowhere in the world does a barrier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peers . Europe , from its most ancient origins one thing , and forged into an active unity by the energies of Rome , has had cut off fromher by these mountains that Iberian part in which is preserved ( less corrupted than perhaps in any other department of the West ) the old stock and the enduring virtues of our race . For the Spanish peasant of the hare upland plateaus is a sort of unchanging model showing us whence we came and by what qualities we may be preserved . These mountains , then , which make such a wall between the Spaniards and the North , are a matter of the liveliest interest ; and the causes of shape and structure which have Oven them this strange power to Isolate a single people from the rest are worthy of much more care than historians or travelers have given to them . To understand the scenery of the Pyrenees and to seize its meaning in culture , as well as its splendor to the eye , is half to understand the story of Europe . That they have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is due to that very power of isolation which they possess ; nor need we fear that the increasing study of them and their greater frequentation which has come in quite recent years will mar their sublimity ; for that very character of theirs which makes them so different from all the other mountain masses of Europe will , as I shall presently show , preserve them from vulgarity . No host of men could spoil the Pyrenees . Before I speak of the physical forms which thus mark them out and which have given them their pecul-iar effect throughout the Christian centuries , I would register some ex-amples of what their effect has been . They kept separate and vigorous for over three hundred years a special national church in which the chief features of our faith rook root . There is in the creed a famous clause upon the full divinity of Christ , which fought its way for admission into Christian formula ? the first use of that clause in the chant-ing of the ritual sprang from Toledo . It was the Pyrenees which set a term to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The valleys of the Pyrenees were foci where the energy of Europe concentrated in the perpetual and repeated charges of raids of Northern men , mounted and armed , beating back Islam . The mule-tracks and the huddled hamlets of those valleys first saw knighthood , and they were the school of war in which Europe re-arose in the Dark Ages until she awoke at last to the Crusades . In those valleys the greatest of our epics was forged , the first of our true Parliaments met ? commons , lords , and priests at Jaca under a king who was king of nothing as yet beyond the narrow l'orrent Gorge of the Aragon . It was the Pyrenees that kept the Iberian Peninsula apart during the spiritual storm of the sixteenth century . It was the Pyrenees that , more than any other natural feature , or than any other inanimate thing , interrupted the scheme of Napoleon . To-day we assist at the beginning of a transformation . New roads are piercing where for so many centuries no wheels could pass . High on that Aragon torrent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will re-open such a scheme of ways as had been lost since the Romans . Something is passing that has hitherto been capital in all our fortunes , and something the departure of which may change Europe in the future much more than those engineers or their masters dream . The Pyrenees , thus distinguished as a wall of walls among mountains , rise as you come close upon their edges from the north in a clear spring . Where other mountains have foothills , the first heights of the Pyrenees stand up sharply , as a rule , from thick , flat , river meadows running parallel to them at their feet ; the bastion outermost heights lift abruptly , half as tall as the greater peaks behind ; and all along the file of giants stand in good dressing like ranks upon parade above the plains . I have so seen them in a summer evening when the sun at his setting had crept round northward of their line . His light shone level , and the reddened headlands so exactly set seemed like the too-strict shores of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea from awful inland regions . But as you come near to this seemingly unbroken face you perceive that other strong feature in the chain which I have seen nowhere else , unless it he in their nearest parallel , the Californian Sierras . This feature may , I think , be called the valley gates . Here and there in the Alps ( and even in the Apennines ) you will find something of the kind . Two great cliffs will form the edges of a gap that cuts right down to the plain and admits a valley floor , through the front , into the rear of the mountains . Such is the once- famous entryto the Gresivaudan which leads up to Grenoble . the portal through which Hannibal passed ( as I believe ) when he challenged the Alps and forced the barriers of i Italy . But in the Pyrenees this sight is not a rare nor an exceptional one . It is the introduction to each of the great valleys ; and you come on each so definitely and at so precise a moment ? there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the plains , after which you have been taken by the mountains ? that you seem to be meeting a person and to be asking for a name . In or near such gates ( I am talking of the northern Gallic escarpment of the range ) you will find in valley after valley a further natural feature peculiar to the Pyrenees , arresting the eye and provok-ing the historical curiosity of every man that comes on it for the first time . This natural feature consists in an isolated rock or rocky hill standing well out from the great mountains upon either side , and , if it be fortified by men , blocking the issue from the valley ? indeed , from a time beyond all records , men have fortified these holders of the gates . The whole region of Foix , with its glory of the later Middle Ages and of the Renaissance , takes its name from such a rock where for centuries the castle stood defending the issue of the gold-rolling river ? Aungera " ? the Ariege . Boldly out in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the heart of the mountains you have Oloron so standing . DEEP GORGES BESET TI-LE Right in the narrow entry of the gorges that lead to Gavarnie you have the rock of Lourdes . And so it is all tip and down the chain . What guess the geologians may have made at this formation I do not know . Nor is it of any great value , for they will change their guess three or four times in the next fifty years . But I know what it is in landscape : as perplexing and sharp a thing as there is in Europe ? that there should be in valley after valley this fortified rock forbidding an entry to the hills , and , round about each , perfectly fiat meadows , so that each stands individual and alone . When a man has entered one of these gates and passed one of these ancient fortresses , he will , after following the road through the gorge which is the issue of the torrent , come , behind the gates of the valley , into yet another feature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two I have already mentioned . This third feature of their scenery is the broadening out of the valley into what looks like , and may have been in remote ages , the level floor of a lake . These inclosed arenas upon which the steep slopes , wooded and cascading one above the other , look down from every side , are not only typical of Pyrenean scenery , but , like most things in the Pyrenees , are typical also of their history and of their part in the formation of Europe . For these inclosed and hidden fertile places within the hills , nourishing each its five or seven villages , have maintained probably through the Roman time , certainly through the Middle Ages ( and , what is more remarkable , furtively in our own day ) , a sort of independent democracy . One , indeed , the Valley of Andorra , with its ramifications , can assert its independence upon the map and in the language of diplomacy . This blessed little republic ( when it is touched at last , its peril may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is suspended politically between France and Spain . It makes its own laws , or rather observes its own customs , and portrays all that was ever said for or against political freedom . It is the happiest community of men I have ever known . But apart from this for-tunate , and secluded place , every one of those defended and cut-off groups of villages in the amphitheaters of the hills has , in spite of modern central governments , a life of its own . It observes its own customs in land tenure , it voluntarily subserves a life not guaranteed by the great capital of the state , but by a local loyalty . So it is with the finest of them all , of which Bedous is the capital , and there , I think , the quiet traveler will best observe the unconquer-able spirit of these heights . The French Republic , the Empire before it , and be-fore that the Monarchy , have called the circle of Bedous for now four hundred years a mere division of French land . But live within it only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has maintained its soul . The young men are conscript for the army ; the children go to schools where their teachers are named from Paris ; the priest in the village church came , until quite lately , like an official from any distance , and would move again to any distance farther . But all this false homogeneity ? suitable to the plains , not suitable to the hills ? does not seem to have diminished in the least the corporate social tradition of that valley . It is the same with that Spanish unity ( Spanish by exception , for it stands to the north of the hills ) , the Val d'Aran . For the Val d'Aran , quite cut off from its own government , not to be reached by any Spanish vehicle ( there is no road from it into Spain ) , lives its own life like a little nation . The same force which made the Swiss cantons works still with splendid vigor in the Pyrenees . Further , I will believe that it is more natural and stronger in those hills . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now no more than a thread , where the ridge of the main range stands up before one at last in a line of serrated rock or of high snow-flaked grass against the sky , there must be noted in these mountains one special sort of human mold , discoverable , indeed , in every mountain range , but here vivid and apart . This is what I may call " The Hamlet at the Foot of the Pass . " Modern travel has slightly degraded these , for they stand where the peaks above them arc most awful and they command the entry to the wildest land . But they are still , and I think will always be , things apart . Gavarnie is the only one I know to have been hurt , and even Gavarnie may return to sanity and quietness under those cliffs of silence . But for the rest , I can recall twenty such hamlets , sometimes but a cluster of twenty houses , sometimes a true village with a church , which guard the last ascent to the ridge and the passage into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a third , Serrat a fourth . These last vestiges of men have this in common : a huddling close together as of sheep in a storm ( for the snow oppresses them most of the year ) , a great sadness in demeanor and in song ? they have their own songs ? and lastly a fidelity von . CXXX. ? No. 778. - 71to their homes , a patriotism of the roof , more enduring than that of the lower levels . There are villages in the Pyrenees that emigrate , but ( paradoxically , perhaps , and strangely ) it is not these higher villages that emigrate ; and while you find men complaining , nearer the plains , that the plains are better worth seeking , in the higher valley you find nothing but regret that ever a man should leave his land . But all this deals with the Gallic escarpment of the Pyrenees : well watered , dense with forests of pine and of beech and enormously lofty in the mists , with perpendicular after perpendicular of limestone reaching up into the hidden sky . Cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun with the entry into Spain , and you find another business in the mountains . It is not for nothing that those farther torrents debouching into once conquered land and into the Ebro Plain that the Mohammedan ravaged so long ( filling the wells , cutting the trees ? it is still parched to-day ) played a part in history different from their twins of the north . The Pyrenees in the south show their changed country in their soil and sparse trees and very ancient , roughly built roofs . I will dare to be so fantastic as to say that the outlines of the hills betray a new fate . Nor will even modern men think this so fantastic , after all , perhaps , when they remember that rocks standing up to the southern sun will suffer different accidents of erosion from those that look northward and nourish sheltered and shaded streams . There are standing up , then , southward , such abrupt hills , with such names as " The Enchanted , " " The Accursed , " " The Stony , " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they contain no regular secluded valleys as does the slope to the north ; rather they stand out like ramparts , ridges parallel one with the other , defending Gaul against the irruption of Africa through Spain . Here are not forests , but groves or woods made of trees standing singly and landscapes of bare earth . Here the torrents also lose their lucidity and become , as the Aragon or the Gallego , tawny like the tawny soil around ; and their names ? like those two names , Gallego and Aragon ? are the names of the Reconquest and of the chief adventure of Christendom . For down their banks Christendom did what fools think can not be done at all , and what has been done so rarely in the history of the world . The men that drank of these rivers set their will against the stream of things and unmade the Mohammedan conquest of Spain . There is a place where the whole spirit of that enormous thing is fixed in landscape . That place is Riglos . Here the Gallego torrent , escaping from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and defending the Pyrenees , comes at last upon the plain . The torrent cuts through cliffs bright red in color , enormous in height , a visionary entry into Spain , and these cliffs have by the process of years ' frost upon frost for centuries become cut into great isolated pillars which men call " The Chimneys of Riglos . " They can be seen from very far away in the brown plains , standing up thus crimson and in shape like the turrets and bastions of some incredibly high castle : a stronghold for Atlas and his sons . By this gap , also , the little railway that now runs no farther than Jaca issues from the hills . By this gap will run in a few years the new great railroad of Europe which they arc making , and which will directly connect , for the first time since the Roman roads fell out of use , Madrid and Paris . The funnel is already pierced under that same Col which carried the old main Roman road , and . I know not in how many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the travel of Europe . All that country , from Huesca at the foot of the hills upon the plain to Jaca on the high torrent of Aragon , and for a day 's ride around , is crammed with history . That torrent Aragon gave its name to the great kingdom because , from its gorge men rode out fighting for three hundred years , and only after those three hundred years had they at last recovered their Christian earth now parched and treeless to the limits of the Ebro . It is perhaps that countryside in Europe which could tell most of ourmedieval origins and of how our assemblies , our ranks , and our romance arose . But it is very'silent , its record is confused and slight . Only its legends are enormous . The Pyrenees upon this southern edge of them show well why they have been such a barrier , and why they have so molded history . For not only do those separate walls of theirs run out flanking the main chain , abrupt and steep ridges , for all the world like huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entice one , before one comes to the main crest , to attempt impassable gorges that lead up to no traverse , but run athwart one 's way . Of these the hugest , a canon more awful than any that I have seen , more impressive even than those of Western America ( for though those are of greater depth , they are broader ) , is that which runs south of the Marbore , cut through quite naked cliffs from heights that take a man a day to climb . It is not until one has attempted such a northward journey into the green lands of the Garonne from the deserts of the Ebro , and attempted it on foot , that one sees either the miraculous contrast between the Gauls and the hard Iberian land , or the obstacle , equally miraculous , which the Pyrenees afford . Water is no small part of this obstacle . For it is not plentiful or limpid here upon the southern side as upon the north . A man must know his way if he is to be certain of camping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save the four or five , in two hundred and forty miles of country , which lead to the very rare permanent crossings of the hills . I think one may best express the difficulty of that land by this example : news there is three days old . The communication of Europe to these remote groups of huts is not directly from across the hills , but round them , and Madrid hears of what is doing in Toulouse half a week before the mountaineers ' can learn it , though they arc by four-fifths nearer to the north . Those who know Spain well say that of all her isolated parts Estremadura is the most alone : that there the noise of the world comes last , and that there men live their lives most as they will without the impress of any foreign fashion . But I think that the Five Towns east of the Basque boundary , or all that broken land between the Valley of Esterri and the Gallego , or even the Catalan tumble of hills to the south , run Estremadura close for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind shelters them also from every influence of change . The Pyrenees will endure not only in their heights and forests , but the simplicity of their villages , their political customs , and all their being . They were saved from too early a discovery at the hands of the vulgar in the days when the charlatans of art were ruining so much else that was beautiful in Europe fifty years ago . They have the advantage of a high differentiation ? many differentraces and different dialects side by side : always an element of permanence . And on the physical side they have this strong guarantee : that they are too large to be overrun and wasted . In the Alps narrow valleys , checked and contained by vast fields of snow and ice above , are soon peopled with fashion , and the area which men without roots have had given over to them to spoil is necessarily restricted . But in the Pyrenees you have region after region of mountain land , not one much less than sixty miles in breadth and all of them open to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are contained by no snow-fields , and the customs of the people and their contempt for the plains are as strong as oak . I do not think that by any accident of travel they can now be overcome or degraded .
