SCENE : The library in the home of JAMES KING . On the left side of the room a large window overlooking the lawn which is suggested beyond . In back , there is a large doubleglass doorway which opens on a hallway , supposed to lead into the main part of the spacious house . In back , at right , there is also an alcove-room , appropriately furnished . On the right side is the handsome fireplace , surrounded by a curved seat . Book-shelves are on either side of this . A large desk rests in the center , with appropriate furnishings , at right angles to footlights . A deep couch and other handsome pieces  --  including a high-backed chair  --  grace the room , which has undoubtedly been furnished by a decorator whose taste has not been hampered by questions of expense . The stage is empty . After a moment JAMES KING enters in a bad temper . KING is a man who has made a large fortune through his gift for business organization , but it has never occurred to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ever since they were children he has enjoyed spoiling his two daughters because nothing could give him a more completely pleasant power of his great wealth . He is an impressive-looking man nearing middle age , and he alternates between moods of irritation and kindliness . He looks about for his newspaper , on desk and under cushions . Finally he pushes button on desk and , after a second , CORINTHIA , the maid , enters . CORINTHIA is the admirable type of maid who remains in one family for a lifetime . She has a rather romantic nature  --  she is still young  --  but knows her place too well to reveal it . She is rather plain but with a cozy sort of charm of her own when once one gets to know her . CORINTHIA Good morning , Mr. King . Did you ring , sir ? p. 3 JAMES KING Ah , Corinthia , have you seen the morning paper ? CORINTHIA No , sir . Is there anything specially interesting ? JAMES KING I mean where is it ? CORINTHIA Oh , yes , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncle took it , sir . JAMES KING Is there no way to protect my morning paper from my family ? In order to keep them from touching mine , I take three other papers . CORINTHIA Four , sir . JAMES KING Four ? CORINTHIA A Herald for the yound ladies . JAMES KING So that they can read the society notes . CORINTHIA A Tribune for Mr. De Witt . JAMES KING He says it has the best sporting page . CORINTHIA The Times for Mr. Pigrim . JAMES KING My uncle enjoys criticizing the military critic . CORINTHIA And the Journal of Commerce for you . JAMES KING Yes . I thought none of the rest of them would want that . p. 4 CORINTHIA Perhaps , sir , I 'd better hide your paper . JAMES KING Good idea . Slip it under the chair cushion , will you ? CORINTHIA Yes , sir . JAMES KING Tell me , is either of my daughters down yet ? CORINTHIA Miss Eva is out riding , sir . JAMES KING With that young Scotchman , I suppose ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eva said they 'd be back for break-fast at ten . JAMES KING If he 's coming with her I sha n't wait . CORINTHIA No , sir . JAMES KING Is n't there any mail ? CORINTHIA Yes , sir . It 's in the hall . I 'll fetch it . Exit CORINTHIA . KING sits at table ; taking check book from drawer and fountain pen from pocket , he starts to write check ; picks up receiver of phone . JAMES KING In phone . Hello  --  hello , Central . What 's the date ? Pause . I say can you tell me what the date is ? Enter CORINTHIA with huge pile of letters . He sees her . Never mind , Central . I know . It 's the first of the month . Hangs up receiver. p. 5 CORINTHIA Smiles brightly . Quite a lot of mail this morning , sir . JAMES KING Takes letters from CORINTHIA and places them in front of him . I might have guessed it was bill day . The family are all taking such good care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Bills  --  bills  --  bills  --  bills  --   --  He sees a lavender letter and slyly slips it into his coat pocket . He continues to open the letters , piling the bills in stacks before him . CORINTHIA Do you wish your breakfast served now , sir ? JAMES KING Yes , please , Corinthia . This is no job to tackle before one gets a good bracer of coffee . CORINTHIA Yes , sir . Exit CORINTHIA . JAMES KING Takes the lavender letter from his pocket , smells the perfume on it , smiles , opens letter , starts to read it . Bills ! Throws bill on table as JULIE and CLINTON are heard speaking in the hall . JULIE DE WITT Outside . Clinnie , Clinnie , darling . p. 6 CLINTON DE WITT Yes , darling . JULIE DE WITT As they enter . I have a flower for your buttonhole . CLINTON DE WITT The great question is , does it go with my necktie ? JULIE DE WITT Come on in the light , Clinnie ; I ca n't see there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , of course , it " does n't go . " KING watches them , disgusted , and resumes his task of opening bills again . If you 're so fond of that color tie , the only thing to do is to give it to the gardner and let him match it . CLINTON DE WITT Pious idea  --  pious idea . JAMES KING Dryly . Good morning , Julie . Both JULIE and CLINTON turn quickly , startled . JULIE is KING 'S elder daughter . She is about twenty-four years old and for three of those years she has been married to CLINTON DE WITT , whom she admires enormously . KING does not share his daughter 's enthusiasm for his son-in-law , who is the descendant of a famous Governor . To KING , CLINTON DE WITT seems just a languid , foppish , idle youth who finds sufficient occupation with tailors , polo-games and parties , without feeling the need of any more definite occupation . He is so devoted to his pretty , doting wife that he could never be suspected of having married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very glad to be able to shelter himself under the comfortable KING roof. p. 7 JULIE DE WITT Oh , why , father , I did n't see you . JAMES KING Pointing to bills . Naturally . I 'm pretty nearly snowed under . CLINTON DE WITT Good morning , Pater . JAMES KING Good morning , Clinton . So you 're proposing to keep my gardneres busy growing flowers to match your taste in ties ? JULIE DE WITT Surely , father , you do n't want to see Clinton dressed in a jarring color scheme ? JAMES KING One jar more or less where Clinton is concerned wo n't matter much . CLINTON DE WITT Protestingly . Oh , I say , Pater . JAMES KING And by the way , while we 're on the subject of son-in-laws , I 'd like to say a word regarding this young lord who is out riding with Eva . JULIE DE WITT Eagerly . " Son-in-law ? " You do n't mean to say that Lord Andrew has proposed to Eva ? CLINTON DE WITT Splendid . JAMES KING @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Well , let me remark that I 'm sick of being cast for the part of the goat in all of our domestic romances . CLINTON looks at JULIE as if " that means me. " p. 8 JULIE DE WITT But surely , father , you want Eva to marry well , do n't you ? JAMES KING If by " well " you mean marry the frayedout end of a long line of ancestors  --  no , I do n't . And I want you folks to understand that I care a damn sight more about keeping my name in Bradstreet 's than I do about getting it in the Blue Book . JULIE DE WITT But , father  --  I  --   --  JAMES KING I tell you I am sick of trying to turn a business plant into a family tree . AUNT ABBY enters . AUNT ABBY is the sister of KING 'S late wife . She enjoys her place in the family with the understanding that she is the chief executive of the domestic organization ; but so many outside organization command her attention that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the servants themselves . She is a born joiner and delights in clubs and conventions . AUNT ABBY ROOKER Ah , good morning , James . CLINTON DE WITT Good morning . AUNT ABBY ROOKER Good morning , Julie . JULIE DE WITT Good morning , Aunt Abby . AUNT ABBY ROOKER James , do you mind if I take the Pierce-Arrow this morning ? It 's so much faster than our car and I 'm so late . p. 9 JAMES KING Where are you going  --  the home for stray cats or the society for the advancement of art among the poor ? AUNT ABBY ROOKER Do n't be silly , James ; I 'm going to a meeting of the Mental Efficiency League . KING leans back in chair , hands in pockets . Such a splendid thing . We hold classes in memory training . Really , James , you ought to attend them ; it would be of such help in your business . JAMES KING Thank you for the suggestion . AUNT ABBY ROOKER They bring in a tray containing twenty objects . You glance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --   --  JAMES KING Breaking in . By the way , what do these lessons in memory training cost ? AUNT ABBY ROOKER Really , James , I do n't remember . JAMES KING They cost $225.00 . I can remember that , and I only glanced at the bill once . AUNT ABBY ROOKER Vaguely . Oh , did I tell them to send the bill to you ? Turns to piano . I suppose I must have  --   --  JAMES KING Say , will you people kindly tell me why on earth do you run accounts in so many different stores ? p. 10 JULIE DE WITT Well  --  it  --  it seems to make the bills so much smaller . CLINTON DE WITT Yes , Pater . JAMES KING What between you people and the Income Tax , I do n't believe I 'll have to get any extra help to land me in the bankruptcy court . Hands CLINTON , at right , a bundle of bills . EVA enters , in riding costume , through door in alcove . EVA is KING 'S younger daughter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have a flock of suitors even if she did n't happen to be an heiress . EVA KING Good morning , everybody . Chorus of good mornings . JULIE waves her hand to her to be careful what she says . What is this , a family conference ? Crosses to KING . Hello , Daddy . Kisses him . I thought this was the morning you were going to take a golf lesson form the Pro . JAMES KING It is ; but I am having a very exciting time in behind this bunker of bills , thank you . Points to different piles of bills . EVA KING I am glad you are still here , Daddy . JAMES KING Thank you , my dear . p. 11 EVA KING I am glad because I am going to have a quarrel with you . CLINTON rises and waves the bunch of bills at her to " look out . " JAMES KING That sounds more natural . JULIE DE WITT Rises . You 'd better not say anything now , Eva . Father is in one of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're both in the same state of irritation . Tell me , blessed head of the family , what on earth caused you to make a fool of both me and yourself by writing and refusing my hand to a gentleman who has never asked for it . JULIE DE WITT Oh ! Looks at Clinton . JAMES KING Doggedly . The fellow 's been hanging round for a month . EVA KING And I intend that Lord Andy shall continue to hang round me until he ceases to amuse me . And if that should mean that I may keep him hanging round " till death do us part , " that is my own business . JAMES KING Oh , is it ? EVA KING Yes ; I 'm the one that has to live with him , not you . p. 12 JAMES KING Glaring at CLINTON . That may be true in some homes , but not in mine . JULIE DE WITT Pained . Please  --  please , father ! When you say that you 're reflecting on Clinton . JAMES KING No , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Working up his irritation . But I 've had about enough of this continual bickering and organized opposition to all of my wishes . CLINTON , signaling to EVA , shows her the bills . AUNT ABBY ROOKER Really , James , who is responsible for the bickering , if it is n't you ? JAMES KING Rises  --  now throughly aroused . You are just as bad as the others , Abby . JULIE DE WITT Laughs slyly . Huh ! JAMES KING Julie ! What do you people think will become of you after I am gone , and you have spent all my money ? You will have to beg . EVA KING Well , one comfort is we have had plenty of practice . JAMES KING Goes to her . Oh , I suppose you think I ought to settle a fortune on each one of you and let you waste it in any silly way you please . p. 13 JULIE DE WITT Rises . Oh , father , you 're wonderful . CLINTON DE WITT Pious idea , Pater , pious idea . JAMES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you need  --  all of you  --  is a little quiet uninterrupted thinking so that you can recover your sense of values ; and it is with the purpose of seeing you get it that we are going to move next Monday . CLINTON DE WITT Move ? JULIE DE WITT Move ? AUNT ABBY ROOKER Do you mean we are going to leave here ? EVA KING Where are we going  --  to Newport ? JAMES KING Turns to her . No  --  Newark . AUNT ABBY ROOKER Newark ! CLINTON DE WITT Newark ! JULIE DE WITT Newark ! CLINTON DE WITT Rises . What ! Spend the summer at Newark ? JAMES KING Fifteen miles outside of Newark  --  at the old farm where I was raised as a boy . JULIE DE WITT Not  --  not that awful place you pointed out to us when we drove down to the Princeton-Yale game ? p. 14 JAMES KING Yes ; that 's the place . JULIE DE WITT Oh ! JAMES KING And I warn you , you may as well start to pack up your wraps . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do about my memory class ? JAMES KING Forget it ! CLINTON DE WITT What on earth shall we do there , Pater ? JAMES KING Raise chickens . ALL Raise chickens ? Raise chickens ? EVA KING Raise chickens , father ? JAMES KING Rises . Yes , maybe you can learn something by seeing how hard they have to scratch for a living . General consternation . I 'm going to breakfast  --   --  JULIE DE WITT But , father  --  listen  --   --  JAMES KING Continuing . Are any of you coming ? He goes out in back ; they look at each other in astonishment . CLINTON DE WITT Say , what are the chief amusements in Newark ? EVA KING Going to bed at eight o'clock . p. 15 JULIE DE WITT It 's ridiculous  --  and just as the season is beginning , too ! AUNT ABBY ROOKER Do you suppose he really means it ? EVA KING Of course he means it . AUNT ABBY ROOKER But what are we going to do ? CLINTON DE WITT I 've got an idea . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raptly . JULIE DE WITT What is it , dear ? CLINTON DE WITT Well  --  it 's an idea that 's been running through my head for a long time . EVA KING It must have had plenty of room to run . JULIE DE WITT Hush , Eva ! Clinnie , please tell us  --   --  CLINTON DE WITT Well , the whole trouble is : we 're all getting on your father 's nerves . He 's been with us too much . EVA KING You 're right , there . CLINTON DE WITT Do you know , Julie , I 've sat down to breakfast and dinner with that man practically every day since I married you . EVA KING Poor father . CLINTON DE WITT And when people see too much of each other they ought to part for a while . p. 16 JULIE DE WITT Oh ! CLINTON DE WITT Now supposing we could get your father to take a trip ? If he were suddenly obliged to pack up and leave , he could n't cart us off to this awful place in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he could n't be continually telling us what to do , and threatening to cut down our allowance if we did n't do it . EVA KING And I would have a chance to make up my mind whether to marry Dr. Delamater or Lord Andrew . AUNT ABBY ROOKER Yes  --  but how will you get him to take a trip ? He 'd never leave us . He 'd make us go with him . CLINTON DE WITT Letting them have it . Ah  --  He could n't take us up the Amazon . EVA KING Up the Amazon ! CLINTON DE WITT Yes . I heard him say last night that he was going to send a man up the Amazon to look over some new rubber plantations . EVA KING Laughing . Can you imagine father leaving us to run things to suit ourselves for two or three months ? CLINTON DE WITT He would n't want to , I know ; but supposing the doctor ordered him to go ? Blows the ashes from cigarette. p. 17 AUNT ABBY ROOKER Pause . The doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  oh , Clinnie , you 're wonderful ! Embraces him . If you ever go into business , I will feel awfully sorry for Mr. Rockefeller . EVA KING You mean you 'd persuade poor old Daddy that he needed a rest and send him away from all of us ? JULIE DE WITT Well , he certainly would n't get much of a rest if he took us with him . EVA KING Rises . No , I do n't like it . It does n't sound very nice . JULIE DE WITT Crosses to EVA . Did n't you just admit , we 've been seeing too much of him  --  and he of us ? CLINTON DE WITT Well , you 'd better hurry up and make up your minds , if you 're going to do it , because there 's Dr. Delamater now . EVA KING How do you know ? CLINTON DE WITT That double ring . AUNT ABBY ROOKER Rises . Yes , it 's just time for him . He always stops in to see your Uncle Horace when he starts on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EVA KING What ? JULIE DE WITT You must explain to Dr. Delamater and ask him to do it . CLINTON DE WITT Yes . EVA KING You mean  --  ask him to persuade Daddy that he is n't well ? CLINTON DE WITT Yes . Dr. Delamater will do anything for Eva . EVA KING Yes . That 's just the reason I do n't care to ask him . JULIE DE WITT Nonsense . We 're desperate . You do n't want to go to Newark , do you ? DR . DELAMATER enters . DR . DELAMATER is a fashionable young physician with a great gift for making himself pleasant to a rich patient . He is very smartly dressed and only a quiet gravity of manner stamps him as a man of science . DR . JACK DELAMATER Ah , good morning , everybody . They greet all around . Hello , Miss Eva  --   --  Crosses to her , shakes hands . Why  --  all dressed for a ride ? EVA KING I 've been riding with Lord Andrew Gordon . You prescribed horse exercise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't prescribe it for him . You promised to call me up . I 'm fond of riding , myself . p. 19 AUNT ABBY ROOKER Starts up . I suppose I 'd better go and tell Uncle Horace you 're here , Doctor . JULIE DE WITT Yes , and we 'll go , too . Come on , Clinnie . DR . JACK DELAMATER No , no , do n't run away . I 've time enough for your uncle . JULIE DE WITT But Eva wants to ask you a favor . EVA KING Julie  --  DR . JACK DELAMATER Smiling . Any favor Miss Eva asks is granted now . CLINTON DE WITT There , what did I tell you ? To ABBY . You try and keep Uncle Horace away till the Pater has seen the doctor . AUNT ABBY ROOKER All right . I 'll do my best . It 's a shame all this has happened to-day . I 've got to read a paper this afternoon at the Omar Khayyam Club . Exit ABBY . CLINTON and JULIE , arm in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DELAMATER Turning to CLINTON . What do you mean by seeing Mr. King ? Mr. King is n't ill , is he ? JULIE DE WITT No , not yet . DR . JACK DELAMATER Not yet ? p. 20 CLINTON DE WITT But he probably will be after he 's seen you  --   --  DR . JACK DELAMATER What ? CLINTON DE WITT Confused . I beg your pardon  --  I do n't mean  --   --  JULIE DE WITT Oh , come along , Clinton . Go on , Eva . CLINTON DE WITT Come on , Julie . They exit as EVA sits on couch . DR . JACK DELAMATER Is your father really suffering from something ? EVA KING Yes  --  family complaint . DR . JACK DELAMATER Family complaint ? EVA KING Too much family ! And we 're suffering equally from too much father . DR . JACK DELAMATER I do n't quite understand . EVA KING We 've called you in , Doctor , to ask you to help us to get rid of father . DR . JACK DELAMATER Horrified . What ? Help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 're not asking you to treat him . DR . JACK DELAMATER Oh ! p. 21 EVA KING We want you to prescribe a long trip . DR . JACK DELAMATER Oh , yes . I see . EVA KING Father 's a dear  --  and I love him very , very much ; but he 's getting a bit rambunctious lately . DR . JACK DELAMATER Close to her . Well , if your father is bossing you round too much , why not move across the road ? Makes a gesture . That new home of mine is waiting for a mistress to come and take charge of it . EVA KING Thank you very much , Dr. Delamater ; but I 'm not ready to take charge of anybody 's home just yet . DR . JACK DELAMATER How many times are you going to make me propose ? EVA KING My present desire is not to change bosses , but to get a complete vacation . DOCTOR turns away . You think I 'd be more independent as your wife than as father 's daughter  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why  --  yes , of course . EVA KING Shaking her head . You 'd be just like father , only jealous besides . DOCTOR turns away . Oh , come on now , let me discuss this case professionally with you . You have n't heard Daddy 's symptoms . p. 22 DR . JACK DELAMATER Making the best of it . You have diagnosed a new disease , I believe : " acute familitis . " Sits near her . EVA KING It is not new  --  lots of people suffer from it . Why , our gardener had a bad attack of wife-trouble in the fall . DR . JACK DELAMATER Wife-trouble ? EVA KING Yes . But two months ' separation from her cured him . And , Doctor , that 's the remedy every family ought to take once a year . DOCTOR looks nonplussed . You know , like they used to feed us sulphur in the spring . DR . JACK DELAMATER Yes . Yes . In your father 's case , I take it , the complaint has been coming on for some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of family , but his ca n't ; and this morning his complaint ended in an absurd obsession that we all seemed powerless to shake . DR . JACK DELAMATER Maintaining his professional attitude . Ah ! And what is the nature of this obsession ? EVA KING That his whole family would be greatly improved by spending the summer raising chickens on a disgusting old farm in New Jersey . p. 23 DR . JACK DELAMATER Shaking his head . New Jersey ! That is certainly serious . EVA KING Yes , is n't it ? DR . JACK DELAMATER Yes , yes ; very serious . Why , I could n't see you if you moved to New Jersey . EVA KING That 's just it , Doctor . Get father  --   --  KING enters briskly . JAMES KING Pleased to see him . Hello , Delamater . DR . JACK DELAMATER Er  --  good morning , Mr. King . Er  --  how are you ? JAMES KING Fine , thank you . Are you still treating Uncle Horace ? DR . JACK DELAMATER Yes . JAMES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . JACK DELAMATER Well  --  er  --  he complains of not sleeping at night . JAMES KING Sits . No , of course not . He sleeps all day instead . DR . JACK DELAMATER Er  --  er  --  It would be a good thing if you took a nap yourself in the afternoon , Mr. King . p. 24 JAMES KING Fine chance ! Looks at EVA . Somebody 's got to stay awake in this family and make some money . DR . JACK DELAMATER As EVA signals him to go ahead . But if you get really ill you may have to give up work for a long time . Looks at EVA for approval . JAMES KING Whirling round on chair . Really ill ? What do you mean by really ill ? I 'm not ill , am I ? EVA KING I do n't think that pallor is anything serious , Doctor . He does n't get out enough , that 's all . JAMES KING Pale ? Who says I 'm pale ? Rubs his cheek . DR . JACK DELAMATER Your hair has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KING It 's got damn good reason to get gray ! DR . JACK DELAMATER Would you mind letting me see your tongue , Mr. King ? KING complies . H 'm , yes  --  yes  --  just what I expected . JAMES KING What did you expect ? What 's the matter with me ? DR . JACK DELAMATER Taking out thermometer . Nothing to worry about . We 'll have you all right in a month or two . p. 25 JAMES KING A month or two ! EVA KING Crossing to back of his chair and putting her arm round his neck . Oh , Daddy , dear . She kisses him . There 's just one little bill that was sent to me this morning by mistake . JAMES KING I might have known it . You girls only kiss me when you want money . EVA KING Well , good gracious , is n't that often enough ? JAMES KING What ! EVA KING Again kisses him . There ! DR . JACK DELAMATER Open your mouth , please . Inserts theremometer before he can protest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she has handed to him . This is from that new lingerie shop . Her prices are rather high ! JAMES KING With thermometer in his mouth . Rather high ! Great Scott , this is awful ! DR . JACK DELAMATER Soothingly . Please , Mr. King , be careful ; do n't bite the thermometer  --   --  JAMES KING Still inarticulately . But this is an outrage . I wo n't pay it . p. 26 DR . JACK DELAMATER Taking KING 'S wrist for pulse . Tell me , Miss Eva , is your father subject to sudden attacks of irritation ? EVA KING Yes , I 'm afraid he is , Doctor . DR . JACK DELAMATER I thought so . That 's an invariable symptom . Looking at watch . Eighty-four . KING mumbles again . Cross your legs , please . I want to test the reflexes . KING obeys . And try to be calm . Absolutely calm . KING brandishes the bill , striking it with his other hand . Never mind the bills ; pay no attention to them . Forget them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All right , here 's one I 'll forget  --  yours . DR . JACK DELAMATER A little taken aback . Mine ? Well , of course , one or two of the more pressing might be attended to . StrikesKING 'S knee-two quick blows and repeats as KING winces . I must insist on your further avoidance of domestic details for a while . Those reflexes are bad  --  very bad . JAMES KING Repeats doctor 's business on his knee . I guess you 're right . I 'm a pretty sick man , eh ? p. 27 DR . JACK DELAMATER With professional cheerfulness . Oh , no . Do n't say that . JAMES KING In a hoarse whisper . You do n't think it 's anything organic ? DR . JACK DELAMATER Organic ? Oh , no , no , certainly not . JAMES KING He knows the professional manner and feels it is pretty desperate . Then what is it ? Tell me , frankly . DR . JACK DELAMATER You want to know exactly ? JAMES KING Bracing himself . Yes ; the plain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble is a metabolistic condition of the thyroids . KING looks at EVA ; she nods her head sympathetically . Modern medical science has noted at periods of extreme nervous exhaustion that these glands undergo a species of temporary atrophia with a resulting diminution of the proper nervous stimulus of the phagocytes . Your pulse and temperature is a concomitant of this condition . I 'm sure if I made a blood test I 'd find the " hemoglobloids " greatly increased . JAMES KING Weakly . Thank you , Doctor , thank you ; " hemoglobloids " are bad things to get , are they ? p. 28 DR . JACK DELAMATER Not in their proper number ; no . JAMES KING Giving up to the conviction that dissolution stares him in the face . What am I to do ? You 're not going to put me in bed ? DR . JACK DELAMATER No , I 'm going to send you away . It 's a change you need . JAMES KING I was planning a change this morning . We 're all going to a farm in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head . No , no . That 's no good . You must get right away  --  away from business  --  away from your family . JAMES KING How 's that ? Away from my family ? Who 's going to run things while I 'm gone ? EVA KING Rises . Oh , do n't bother about us , Daddy , dear . Think of yourself for once . DR . JACK DELAMATER Why do n't you run off to Canada ? JAMES KING Canada ? I 've done nothing wrong . DR . JACK DELAMATER Somewhere up in the woods . EVA KING I know ! I 've got a splendid idea ! JAMES KING What is it ? p. 29 EVA KING Daddy , did n't you say you were sending a man up the Amazon to look at some rubber plantations ? JAMES KING You expect me to go to Manouse ? Why , that trip would take three months . DR . JACK DELAMATER Just right . Nothing could be better . It 's an inspiration , Miss Eva . EVA KING You know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the land of romance and adventure ! JAMES KING Oh , yes , that 's true . I should enjoy it all right enough . Catches sight of the bills . But , no ; my conscience wo n't let me . EVA KING Bother your conscience . We shall be all right here without you , Daddy . JAMES KING Patting her hand . You see , Doctor . What did I tell you ? At heart she 's a dear , sweet , unselfish girl . DR . JACK DELAMATER Yes , yes ; of course . JAMES KING Thinking of her old Daddy , is she ? All right , I 'll go ! EVA KING Hurray ! JAMES KING How 's that ? EVA KING Of course we 'll miss you , Daddy . p. 30 JAMES KING Will you , really ? EVA KING The place will seem quite different without you . JAMES KING It 's going to be an awful rush for me to get off . The South American boat leaves to-morrow . EVA KING I 'd better go and talk to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear ? That 's a good girl . Attempts to reach phone , which is only a couple of feet from him ; but he gives the impression he is too weak to get it . Eva !  --   --  EVA KING Yes , Daddy ? JAMES KING Just hand me the phone , please . I 'll have to call up the office . Pats her hand as she gives it to him . EVA KING Poor sick Daddy. ! JAMES KING Do n't worry about that lingerie bill ; I 'll pay it . EVA KING Thank you , Daddy ; thank you . Looks at him . Do you know , Doctor , I think even the idea of going away is doing him good . She goes off . DR . JACK DELAMATER Calling after her . One moment , I want to have a word with you . p. 31 JAMES KING Just a moment , Doctor . In phone . Hello , Cortlandt 6680 . He whispers it . Evidently Central does n't get it . Cortlandt 6680 . She asks what number , again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6680 . DR . JACK DELAMATER Do n't let yourself get excited ! Careful , Mr. King , careful . JAMES KING Weakly again . Oh , yes . You know , Doctor , it 's a funny thing how much better your family looks to you when you 're getting ready to leave it . Honestly , I almost believe I 'll miss them . DR . JACK DELAMATER I 'll keep an eye on them for you , Mr. King . JAMES KING That 's right ; especially Eva . DR . JACK DELAMATER Smiling . Trust me . JAMES KING And look out for that Scotch fortune hunter . DR . JACK DELAMATER Indeed , I shall . I hope you 'll find us engaged when you get back . JAMES KING I 'll be very well satisfied if I do . Puts down the phone , holds out his hand to the DOCTOR . DR . JACK DELAMATER  --  DOCTOR takes KING 'S hand . I trust you . I trust you implicitly . p. 32 DR . JACK DELAMATER Oh , er  --  er  --  thanks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in with a prescription , later on . He exits . JAMES KING Thank you , Doctor . In phone : Hello , is that Miss Laura ? Put Mr. Smith on the phone . Is n't there ? Well , where the devil is he ? Voice changing to plaintive note . It 's a shame his not being there to look after things . I 'm a sick man , Miss Laura . A very sick man . Yes  --  I 've felt it coming on for a long time but I just would n't give up to it . When Mr. Smith comes in , tell him  --  what 's that ? I told him to come down here ? Did I ? There you see  --  memory going  --   --  In phone : I say , my memory is going . Oh ! this is awful ! Hangs up receiver . There is a sound of a motor leaving the house . UNCLE HORACE rises . He has been invisible in a big chair with its back turned to audience  --  in alcove . UNCLE HORACE is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hypochondria , as he finds it excuses him for picking out the most comfortable chair and refusing to budge from it no matter who enters the room . He professes to be a great sufferer from insomnia and tries to snatch a doze whenever he can throughout the day . He has rather a waspish manner of the ancient celibate. p. 33 HORACE PIGRIM Stretches and yawns . Hello  --  what 's that motor ? Who 's in that motor ? JAMES KING Starting . What 's the matter with you ? What do you mean , Uncle Horace , by jumping out at one suddenly like that ? I 've got to be careful of my nerves . I 'm a sick man . HORACE PIGRIM I 've been taking a nap . JAMES KING That 's no reason why you should wake up like a Jack-in-the-box . HORACE PIGRIM I thought that sounded like my doctor coming . JAMES KING No , it 's my doctor going . HORACE PIGRIM Your doctor ? Do you mean to tell me Dr. Delamater has left without seeing me ? JAMES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as I am ; I mean you 're as well as I used to be . HORACE PIGRIM Do you really think you 're sick ? JAMES KING Of course , I 'm sick . Do n't you see how pale I am ? And my tongue is all wrong . And my reflexes are simply terrible . HORACE PIGRIM You seem to be proud of it . JAMES KING Why , I 'm so weak I can hardly hold the telephone . p. 34 HORACE PIGRIM What 's your pulse ? JAMES KING Eighty-four . HORACE PIGRIM Aha ! Mine 's eighty-nine . JAMES KING Oh , you think you 're sicker than I am , do you ? HORACE PIGRIM Stretching and yawning . I know damn well I am . JAMES KING What do you bet ? HORACE PIGRIM A hundred dollars . JAMES KING I 'll take you . HORACE PIGRIM Where is your hundred ? JAMES KING Takes it from pocket and lays it on table . Right here . Where 's yours ? HORACE PIGRIM Feeling in pocket . Let 's see . Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . Takes bill , puts it back again . There , there 's mine . Now you 're still shy . Keeping his finger on bill . JAMES KING I like your nerve . Your doctor 's bill can represent your hundred . Takes bill from pile . HORACE PIGRIM Now shall I begin by telling you what 's the matter with me ? p. 35 JAMES KING No , I have heard your symptoms every day for the past ten years . HORACE PIGRIM All right . Then what 's the matter with you ? JAMES KING " Hemoglobloids " ! The doctor says I 'm full of them . HORACE PIGRIM What are " hemoglobloids " ? JAMES KING I do n't know exactly . HORACE PIGRIM Well , James , let me tell you something . You 're not sick . You 've fallen for a put-up job . While I was there  --  trying to doze  --  I heard the family planning to get the doctor to send you away . JAMES KING You 're talking in your sleep . HORACE PIGRIM Wish to God I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . JAMES KING Why should they want him to send me away ? HORACE PIGRIM They 're tired of your interfering and scolding and bullying  --   --  JAMES KING Rubbish  --  I do n't believe it . HORACE PIGRIM They said you 'd threatened to pack them off to the old King farm at Newark . JAMES KING What ? Is that true ? Whom did you hear ? Who were they ? p. 36 HORACE PIGRIM All of them  --  the whole lot . JAMES KING Not Eva ? HORACE PIGRIM Eva and Julie and Abby and Clinton . JAMES KING He rises , grabs the money . HORACE reaches for it too late . Well , I 'm damned ! JULIE appears at door . JULIE DE WITT In a lowered affected-sympathetic voice . Father , dear , there 's a Mr. Smith asking for you . JAMES KING Send him in . JULIE DE WITT But do you think I 'd better ? After what the doctor said , I 'm afraid you ought n't to talk business  --   --  JAMES KING Shouting . Send him in ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HORACE . Is n't he a poor dear ? It makes you feel irritable , does n't it ? Backing up to door . But you 'll be all right once you get away to South America . Mechanically goes through the motion of blowing him two kisses , she exits . JAMES KING Just wait . Just wait till I 'm through with Smith . I 'll talk to this family ! Direct to UNCLE HORACE : I 'll have something to say to the whole lot of you ! p. 37 HORACE PIGRIM Me ? Why include me ? JAMES KING Because you 're one of the family ! Families are all alike . At any rate rich men 's families are ! A bunch of ungrateful , idle wasters ! HORACE PIGRIM Say , where 's that hundred dollars ? Do n't forget , I won that bet . JAMES KING Pats trousers pocket . This hundred goes to pay your doctor 's bill ; it goes to that Delamater , the man I was just ready to welcome as a son-in-law . HORACE PIGRIM Do n't get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nerves ! Your nerve , you mean ! HORACE PIGRIM James , if you are rude to me , I shall leave your house ! JAMES KING Leave my house ? Do n't make me laugh . You came here to spend a week-end and you 've stayed fifteen years ! HORACE PIGRIM Well , I shall go ; I shall go this very day ! JAMES KING I 've heard you say that before ; but I notice you never go far enough to be out of earshot of the dinner-gong ! HORACE PIGRIM This is the end  --  and after all I have done for you . JAMES KING Turns on him . " You 've done for me " ? p. 38 HORACE PIGRIM Yes . I 've sat up and played pinochle with you when I ought to have been sleeping . KING turns away  --  disgusted . Enter ADAM SMITH . ADAM is a strange mixture of romance and practical common sense . Circumstances have sent him adventuring into the wilds . But this part of his career seems dreary and commonplace to ADAM . Romance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'S chief failing is that he does n't know how to dress . He delights in belted coats and pockets with flaps that button and other such enormities of masculine attire . He is in his middle thirties . ADAM SMITH Oh , good morning , Mr. King . JAMES KING Gruffly . Good morning , Smith . Wo n't you sit down ? ADAM SMITH Thanks . About to sit on couch he takes in the situation , goes to piano and looks over a book . HORACE PIGRIM Good-bye , James . No answer . I say good-bye , James . JAMES KING Good-bye . HORACE PIGRIM At door . I never thought when I accepted your invitation for that week-end it would finish like this . Turns , walks out with his head erect. p. 39 ADAM SMITH You 're not looking well this morning , Mr. King . JAMES KING No ? ADAM SMITH You know , what you need is a holiday . JAMES KING You think I ought to take a trip , too ? ADAM SMITH I suppose you 'll say you ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't blame you . JAMES KING You like it here , eh ? ADAM SMITH Like it ? It 's perfect . It 's a home . JAMES KING Yes ; it 's a home all right ! ADAM SMITH It takes a homeless , lonely fellow like me to appreciate the way you 're blessed , Mr. King . As I came up the drive and saw this lovely big house hedged about with honeysuckle and roses , and looking so sweet and peaceful , I just realized all I was missing in my life . Looks at window . And then when I turned the corner and saw your family sitting out on the porch  --  oh , but it must be wonderful to have a family ! JAMES KING They were all on the porch ? ADAM SMITH Yes , sir . And they looked so happy . They were all laughing . p. 40 JAMES KING Getting up . Laughing ? They were all laughing ? ADAM SMITH Yes . They seemed as merry and carefree JAMES KING Through his teeth . Just wait  --  just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ADAM SMITH Startled . I beg pardon , sir ? as a lot of kids the day school closes . ing . I mean if you just wait you 'll have a family yourself some day . ADAM SMITH I hope you 're right , sir ; but I hate to think of all the time I 'm losing . You 're simply not living when you 've only got yourself . Can you imagine what it would be like to come home , and not find your loved ones waiting for you with outstretched arms ? JAMES KING Outstretched arms ? Outstretched hands , you mean . You know a hell of a lot about families , do n't you ? ADAM SMITH Why , Mr. King ! JAMES KING They made a pretty picture out there on the porch , did n't they ? The smiling faces ! I know why they were smiling all right . And the sunshine filtering through the honeysuckle and the soft-colored summer dresses . Snatches up a bill , hands it to ADAM . See that ? p. 41 ADAM SMITH What is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dresses ! How 'd you like to pay that ? Have you seen their hats ? No , neither have I ; but I 've seen this . Hands him bill . And here 's the things they wear underneath . Hands him lingerie bill . Sometimes on Monday afternoons I go out and sit in the clothes-yard just to try and get my money 's worth on the lingerie bill . ADAM SMITH If you 'll pardon me , Mr. King , why do you encourage them to be so extravagant ? You ought to speak to them . JAMES KING Speak to them ? ADAM SMITH I s'pose you 're afraid of hurting their feelings . But if you were very careful of the way you expressed it : all you need to do is just drop a hint . Love is a wonderful interpreter . JAMES KING Say , where have you been all your life ? ADAM SMITH For the most part I 've been up at Manouse looking after your rubber plantations . JAMES KING Then I 'm partly responsible for your innocence , am I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , to-morrow . ADAM SMITH Yes , sir . That 's what I want to talk to you about . Ca n't you send somebody else , Mr. King ? p. 42 JAMES KING Why do n't you want to go ? ADAM SMITH It 's so lonely . I do n't believe I could stand it again . You ca n't realize what it 's like , never to see a woman . JAMES KING Interested . Are n't there any women there ? ADAM SMITH There were just three Anglo-Saxon women when I first went there and one of them left and one 's dead . JAMES KING What 's the matter with the other one ? ADAM SMITH She was almost killed by our kindness , too . The whole club used to paddle six miles up the river on Sunday afternoons just to sit and look at her . She was the only relative any of the boys had . JAMES KING You had to paddle six miles up river to see a relative ? You are not describing Manouse ; you 're describing heaven . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always longed for a place like that , longed for adventure , to get off in the wilds . I love to picture myself sitting by the camp fire , listening to a cougar howling in the forest , or watching the crocodiles heave about in the river like drifting logs , while a pink cloud of flamingoes floats across the window of blue sky that opens between the palm trees . p. 43 ADAM SMITH Quite unmoved . Sounds very wonderful ; but take my word for it , it does n't compare with a wicker chair out on your porch . Oh , Gee  --  Life 's a funny thing , is n't it ? Here I am envying you everything you 've got and you 're envying me everything I 've had . And you talk about the place I call Hell as Heaven . JAMES KING Staring ahead of him a moment . Adam , why ca n't we change places ? ADAM SMITH Startled . Change places ? How do you mean ? JAMES KING I mean that I will go to Manouse , if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joking . JAMES KING Oh , no , I am not . You 're longing for a family and I 'm longing for a rest . ADAM SMITH You mean that you 'd actually leave me in charge of your family ? JAMES KING I mean I 'll install you here as father . They do n't think much of me as a father , so I would like to let them try a new one . ADAM SMITH If you will pardon me , Mr. King , I think that is one of the wildest ideas I ever heard . JAMES KING Not at all . It would be a liberal education for you  --  and believe me , you need it . It 's really awful to think of a poor innocent fellow going about with the idea that if you want to stop women from being extravagant , all you need do is " drop a hint " ! You long for the touch of a woman 's hand , do you ? You 'll get it , boy , you 'll get it ; if you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , Adam . Your honesty and faithfulness have helped me to make a large fortune . So I 'd like to do something for you . I want to open your eyes before you 've landed yourself with a wife , a mother-in-law and a couple of kids . p. 44 ADAM SMITH But what would your family say to the scheme ? JAMES KING We do n't need to care what they say . I 've still got one hold over my family . They all sit up on their hind legs and woof when I hold out this little book . Holds up check book as if it were a piece of sugar for a poodle . ADAM SMITH Shocked . You rule them with a check book . That is n't right , Mr. King . JAMES KING If you can discover any other way to rule them , I shall be most grateful . LORD ANDREW and EVA , in conversation , enter . EVA has changed her riding suit , and is now dressed in a walking suit and hat . LORD ANDREW is dressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . LORD ANDREW GORDON is the attractive son of a Scotch peer . Like some of his class , his education seems to have come chiefly from the stable , rather than the schools and university which he unquestionably attended . He is good-looking , with a frank , pleasant face and the finely-kept body of an outdoor man . As they enter ADAM rises and bows to them . LORD ANDREW GORDON Hello , Mr. King  --  How'r y'r ? JAMES KING How do you do ? p. 45 EVA KING I hope we 're not disturbing a business chat , but Lord Andrew said he 'd had a very strange note from you ! LORD ANDREW GORDON Oh , I say  --  not strange  --  odd ; that 's all I said  --  odd . But I understand perf  --   --  I know Mr. King is a bit off his food . Do you know I do deuced funny things when I get anything the matter with me . Seems to sort of go to my head , if you know what I mean . JAMES KING Yes ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Exactly . Yours is liver . KING stares at him . That 's what it is  --  liver . I can see that at a glance . The good old Pater used to get that same yellow look about the gills . Affected his disposish . Would even kick the dogs around if he could n't find any of the family about . EVA KING Those were the times you all ought to have gone off and left him . The trouble with family life is that families are together too much . ADAM SMITH He just ca n't stand any more . The whole trouble with family life is that families are n't together enough . They do n't learn to understand each other 's tastes and feelings ; they do n't make love the interpreter of their crossed purposes ; they forget the great lesson of bear and forbear . EVA and ANDY turn to ADAM in astonishment. p. 46 JAMES KING The gentleman who has just expressed these very noble sentiments , is my manager , Mr. Adam Smith . Mr. Smith , my younger daughter , Eva @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss King . I had no right to contradict you . I was sort of carried away . EVA KING That 's all right , Mr. Smith . Have you met Lord Andrew Gordon ? ADAM SMITH How do you do ? LORD ANDREW GORDON Loftily . ' Ow do ? EVA KING So you do n't agree with my views on family life , Mr. Smith ? ADAM SMITH No , Miss King , I do n't . A family is the greatest school in life , because it makes you learn to study the other fellow . I 've led what they call an adventurous life ; but the greatest adventure of all is one I 've missed . EVA KING What do you mean ? ADAM SMITH Well , I call the greatest adventure in the world to be able to climb down the chimney of some house and then try to get on as well as possible with the people inside . And that 's what happens to you the day you 're born . LORD ANDREW GORDON I say , what did happen to you the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people all died while I was a baby . I had n't any family at all . JAMES KING Determined . Cheer up ! You soon will have ! EVA KING Why ? Is Mr. Smith going to get married ? JAMES KING Going to door . Not if I can save him from making that first fatal step , he is n't . Calls off : Abby ! Julie ! Come in here . Bring Clinton . Coming to ADAM . I do n't want you to miss Clinton . EVA KING What 's the matter , Daddy dear ? You seem upset . AUNT ABBY ROOKER Entering , with hat on . What is it , James ? I really must hurry . I 'll be awfully late for my class . JAMES KING Come in , Abby . I want you to meet Mr. Adam Smith . To ADAM : This is my late wife 's sister , Miss Rooker : a prominent club woman and organizer of charities . She also keeps house for me ; but , of course , her life is so well filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . AUNT ABBY ROOKER crosses to ADAM and shakes hands . How do you do , Mr. Smith ? I am sure you will excuse me if I run . p. 48 JAMES KING Stopping ABBY . One moment , please . JULIE and CLINTON enter . CLINTON stays at door , keeping out of it . JULIE DE WITT Sweetly . Father , dear , did you call ? JAMES KING Yes . I am leaving you this morning for a long time . All show pleasure . CLINTON comes down left of JULIE and shakes her hands aside . Adam , meet your daughter , Julie . JULIE DE WITT His daughter ; what do you mean ? ADAM SMITH A little joke of your father 's , Miss Julie . JAMES KING Not " Miss . " Julie is married . Shake hands with your son-in-law , Clinton De Witt . CLINTON DE WITT Crosses toward ADAM , hand out-stretched , but does n't give it to ADAM . When  --  why , Pater , what the devil  --   --  JAMES KING Clinton is uncertain just what to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plenty of time to think it over . You see he does n't want to make a mistake . In the meanwhile he is good enough to make his abode under my roof . If you want any pointers about tailors or tea parties , or tennis racquets , I can recommend Clinton . p. 49 EVA KING Really , Dad , you are embarrassing everyone terribly . JAMES KING You 've already met little Eva , also Lord Andrew Gordon . UNCLE HORACE enters . Ah , wait , here 's one more ! Uncle Horace . HORACE PIGRIM Not seeing ADAM at first . James , I 've come to tell you that I was wrong . JAMES KING What ? HORACE PIGRIM I said you were n't sick  --  but you must be . I realize that you would n't have spoken to me as you did if you were yourself . JAMES KING So you 're not going to leave me after all ? HORACE PIGRIM No . However rude you were I 'm not going to desert the family in a crisis . If something were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've to rely on . JAMES KING Oh , I see . You 've decided to help them get rid of me , after all ? AUNT ABBY ROOKER Why , what do you mean , James ? JAMES KING It was a very pretty little plot to ship me off to the wilderness for three months so that you could all do just as you please . JULIE DE WITT Why , Father , surely you do n't think  --   --  p. 50 JAMES KING No , I do n't think , I know . Do n't I , Horace ? All look at the " traitor . " But do n't worry . Even though I realize that it was only a bunco-game I 'm going to go just the same . I may not need a rest , but I want a rest . And I want it bad . EVA KING Why , Dad , how clever of you to realize it . JAMES KING Only there 's one little alteration I 'm going to make in your scheme . You 'd like to get rid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you need a father . So here you are . From to-day on this family has got a new Dada  --   --  Indicates ADAM . Here he is . CLINTON DE WITT What on earth do you mean ? Together . JULIE DE WITT Father , you 're not serious ? Together . EVA KING Father ? Together . JAMES KING Mr. Smith will be the head of this household while I 'm gone . He will pay the bills and settle all domestic questions . You will consult him just as you would me . HORACE PIGRIM Over KING 'S shoulder . No , James , you 're not sick  --  you 're crazy ! All protest. p. 51 JULIE DE WITT But surely , Father , you do n't  --   --  ADAM SMITH Protesting . Really , Mr. King , if they do n't want me ; and it 's only natural they should n't  --   --  JAMES KING Of course , they do n't want you . They 'd like a chance to do all the silly , extravagant , idiotic things that they ca n't do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dad , Mr. Smith is a stranger . He does n't know us . JAMES KING No , and it 's a damn good thing he does n't . Mr. Smith has a very limited idea of family life . Hence he 's longing for it . He has a charming picture in his mind that I hope you will all help him to realize . It is evening , the lamps are lit ; the curtains drawn ; Father is sitting by the log fire with his family all about him . Aunt Abby is knitting ; Julie and Clinton are playing parchesi ; Uncle Horace is reading out loud some interesting excerpts from the Literary Digest ; while Eva is seated at the piano playing very softly and sweetly that dear old melody , " Home Sweet Home . " Says this very sweetly through his teeth with an exaggerated smile . ADAM SMITH That 's very charming , indeed . But really I shall feel like an intruder within the sacred circle . After all , the atmosphere of the home is hallowed , an alien presence might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see ! He ca n't talk about the home without getting poetical . Goes to ADAM . Oh , my boy , my boy  --  what an awakening you 're going to get ! AUNT ABBY ROOKER Really , James , this is all so preposterous ! LORD ANDREW GORDON It fairly knocks me out ; the poor old bean is just swimming . EVA KING Rises . Do you know , Dad , I think it 's a splendid idea ! ALL What do you mean ? JULIE DE WITT Why , Eva ? HORACE PIGRIM Are you crazy , too ? EVA KING Dad deserves a vacation . We have led him an awful life . JULIE DE WITT I  --   --  EVA KING Now it 's a fact . Sweetly . And I 'm sure Mr. Smith will make a splendid father . ADAM SMITH Thank you . Really , Miss King , if you feel that way about it , I feel inclined to accept . ALL look at him . Of course , I appreciate it 's rather a wild idea ; but after all you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on ? They wo n't want to lean on you , they 'll sit on you ! But remember , Smith , you wo n't have a chance to spoil them too far . I 'm going to arrange with my lawyers to give you just a certain amount to spend on them  --  turns to them  --  and I 'm going to cancel all the charge accounts . All protest. p. 53 AUNT ABBY ROOKER But , James , you ca n't do that . JAMES KING Inexorably . And if Smith does n't approve your purchases , all your C. O. D. 's will be S. O. S. 's . JULIE DE WITT Oh , this is too humiliating ! CLINTON DE WITT Really , Mr. King , you might show a little more consideration for one 's feelings . JAMES KING You showed a lot of consideration for me when you planned this nervous breakdown of mine with Dr. Delamater ! I 'm going up to pack . EVA KING You 're not leaving yet , are you ? JAMES KING You 'll all have a chance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you want me to come up with you ? JAMES KING At door . No , stay here and get acquainted with your new family . JULIE DE WITT But after all , Father , do you think you 'd better go on such a long trip ? AUNT ABBY ROOKER Yes , if you want a little rest , why not let us all go down to White Sulphur Springs ? CLINTON DE WITT Pious idea . p. 54 JAMES KING I 'm going to South America ; and I 'm going alone . EVA KING He wants romance . Poor dear , he 's never had it . ADAM SMITH He 'll be sick of it soon enough . You do n't realize it , Mr. King , but you 're going to be terribly lonely . JAMES KING Do n't realize it , do n't I. Why that 's the whole reason I 'm going . All my life I 've been longing for it . Lonely ! I 'm going to try to be so blame lonely that maybe I 'll be able to understand why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Exit KING . JULIE DE WITT Calling after him : But , Father  --   --  There is an awkward pause as they all sit in silence . AUNT ABBY ROOKER I 'm sure Mr. Smith must feel as uncomfortable as we do . ADAM SMITH Thoroughly abashed in the presence of the ladies . He hesitates  --  starts to speak  --  can not  --  smiles  --  tries again . Do n't call me Mr. Smith  --  call me Adam . EVA KING Oh , no. rises . I 'm going to call you Father . ADAM sinks into chair and picks up the check book. @x SCENE I : The same as the previous act . It is about 5:30 on a rainy evening . The lamps are lighted . Ten days have elapsed . CORINTHIA enters , carrying a smoking jacket and slippers . She puts the smoking jacket over chair and places the slippers , side by side , in front of the fire . There is a sound of approaching footsteps . CORINTHIA gets to her feet , and at the same time , ADAM appears in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the office . He is wearing a light overcoat and carrying a flat cardboard box . He enters and stands looking around as if he is expecting to see someone . CORINTHIA You 're home early . ADAM SMITH Home ! Do you call this home ? He says it a little bitterly . He is still wearing the overcoat as he lays box and hat on couch . Where 's all the family to-night ? CORINTHIA Where your family usually is , sir  --  off somewhere spending money . ADAM SMITH Do n't call them my family , Corinthia . CORINTHIA I 'm sorry , sir ; I understood it was Mr. King 's orders . ADAM SMITH Corinthia , why do they dislike me so ? p. 56 CORINTHIA They do n't  --  at least only Miss Julie and Mr. Clinton . ADAM SMITH Hopefully . Clinton does n't count much , does he ? CORINTHIA I should say not ! He 'll never get round-shouldered carrying his brains about . ADAM SMITH Taking tie-clip from pocket . Here 's one thing he 's been picking on . Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tie-clips ? ADAM SMITH Sitting on arm of couch . Yes  --  this thing ; clips the end of the tie to the shirt so it ca n't blow in your face or get mussed up  --  I mean the tie . I thought they were all right till I heard Clinton De Witt telling a party of people on the porch about my wearing a tie-clip . The way they laughed , you might have thought he 'd said I wore a nightcap . CORINTHIA Do n't you pay any attention to that oil-can . ADAM SMITH Still the way Mr. King fixed it , Clinton De Witt is one of my family and I suppose it 's not very nice to knock your family , is it ? CORINTHIA It may n't be nice but it 's darned usual . p. 57 ADAM SMITH With a sigh . I guess family life is different from what I imagined . CORINTHIA Yes , I guess you got your idea of families out of the Elsie books . ADAM SMITH I thought it was going to be so cozy and comfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ADAM SMITH My raincoat ? He looks down and notices he is still wearing it . Oh , yes  --  yes , of course . He pulls it off , CORINTHIA helping him . Honestly , Corinthia , if I did n't have you to talk to I 'd be lonelier than I was back on the Amazon . CORINTHIA I 'm glad to hear I 'm some help to you . ADAM SMITH Indeed you are . You know for years and years I used to picture how it would be , coming home from the office at night , tired . There 'd be your slippers warming in front of the fire , and your smoking jacket all ready to slip on , and smiling faces and loving greetings and little hands feeling in your pockets . CORINTHIA Little hands ? It seems to me you 're expecting a good deal for such a short acquaintance . ADAM SMITH I 'm sorry , Corinthia ; I 'm just a sentimental idiot . p. 58 CORINTHIA If you 'll excuse me , sir . I 'll get you your slippers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must n't do that . Turns to fireplace . Why , hullo  --   --  CORINTHIA What is it ? ADAM SMITH Here they are . CORINTHIA That 's funny . I wonder who could have put them there ? ADAM SMITH It  --  it could n't have been one of the family ? CORINTHIA I do n't know . Miss Eva was here when I came in to light the lamps . ADAM SMITH Eva ! He breathes the word and his face lights up at the thought that it was she . Then perhaps she  --  . No , no . She would n't want to make me feel at home . CORINTHIA Would it make you feel happy to think she had put them there ? ADAM SMITH Under his breath . You bet . CORINTHIA You 'd better let me take your coat , sir . ADAM SMITH Thank you . Takes off coat and hands it to her . CORINTHIA Looking at his shirt sleeves . Excuse me , sir  --  what is that thing you are wearing on your sleeve ? p. 59 ADAM SMITH That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see them ? Snaps one against his arm . Great idea , especially in the office  --  holds your cuffs up . CORINTHIA is silent , still looking at the sleeve garters . ADAM glances at her , his cheery smile fading to something like apprehension . What do you mean ? They 're not the thing ? CORINTHIA Do n't let the family see you wearing them . ADAM SMITH No ? CORINTHIA If your shirt sleeves need shortening , I 've got plenty of time on my hands . ADAM SMITH All right , thank you , Corinthia ; you 're awfully good to me . Pulls the sleeve garters off . CORINTHIA steps forward to take them  --  he puts them in his pocket . Starts to take off his shoes and put on slippers . CORINTHIA Yes , I 'm funny like that . Takes his hat from couch ; sees box he has laid there . Shall I put this box in your room , sir ? ADAM SMITH No , do n't bother , I 'll take it . That 's my new dress suit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be finished . p. 60 ADAM SMITH Clinton De Witt ca n't kick on that  --  his own tailor made it . CORINTHIA You 're going to wear it at dinner to-night ? ADAM SMITH Rises and puts on smoking jacket . Sure . I say , Corinthia  --  do n't forget to cough if I do anything wrong , while you 're waiting on table . CORINTHIA I 'll try and keep an eye on you . Exits , carrying the hat and two coats . ADAM softly whistles the refrain of " My Little Gray Home in the West . " With one slipper on , he crosses to the box on couch . Then , with the scissors , cuts the string of the box , and starts to open it . EVA KING Enters . Hello ! ADAM turns , holding box under his arm . Have you seen my sister anywhere ? ADAM SMITH Good evening , Miss King . EVA KING Miss King ? That 's rather a formal way of addressing your daughter . ADAM SMITH Lays box on bench . Do n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter joke ? EVA KING Do n't you want me to think of you as a father ? p. 61 ADAM SMITH No . EVA KING Why not ? ADAM SMITH Why not ? Because  --   --  He pauses and his courage fails him . If you think of me as a father you 'll begin to think of me as old  --  not old in years perhaps , but stodgy and serious . EVA KING No  --  You 're just the thing I 've been asking for . ADAM SMITH Eagerly . Am I really ? EVA KING Yes , a young father : one who 's not too old to understand my problem . ADAM SMITH Oh  --   --  Laughs , embarrassed . Looks down  --  sees he has only one slipper on . I beg your pardon . Goes to chair and puts on the other slipper . I suppose , Miss King , you want to ask my advice about something ? EVA KING Yes . My own father took a dislike to Andy on principle , so it was no use to try to talk it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my opinion of Lord Andrew ? EVA KING I 've been trying to make up my mind which would make the better husband , Dr. Delamater or Lord Andrew . p. 62 ADAM SMITH Good Heavens ! Do you have to marry one of them ? EVA KING Well , I suppose I 've got to marry  --  someone . ADAM SMITH I suppose . I 've never met Dr. Delamater . EVA KING He 's coming here to-night ; they both are . ADAM SMITH For an answer . EVA KING Not exactly . You see , Lord Andrew has n't proposed as yet . ADAM SMITH But you know they both love you ? EVA KING Of course . Why , a girl can always tell when a man is in love with her . ADAM SMITH Always ? EVA KING Nodding . Always . ADAM SMITH That opens up a new line of thought ! EVA KING How ? ADAM SMITH Well , if a girl knew a man was in love with her and she were to encourage him a little bit , he might assume she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KING For instance ? ADAM SMITH Well , suppose she put his slippers in front of the fireplace ? p. 63 EVA KING Oh , I see . You 're thinking of poor Corinthia . ADAM SMITH Puzzled . Corinthia ? EVA KING Yes . I met her coming in here with your slippers and smoking jacket . ADAM SMITH You mean that Corinthia  --   --  EVA KING But then you did n't need that to tell you that Corinthia was crazy about you ? ADAM SMITH You 're not serious ? EVA KING Certainly I am . Only do n't be alarmed ; she realizes that there 's a chasm between you . ADAM SMITH That would n't make a particle of difference if I loved her . EVA KING I do n't know . I do n't think it can be very nice to marry anyone whose tastes and habits are on a different plane from your own . ADAM SMITH Oh , you would n't marry a man who  --  I understand . However , both the men you 're considering have got the right tastes and habits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does it ? EVA KING No . ADAM SMITH Which one do you love ? EVA KING I 'm not sure that I love either . Neither the doctor nor Andy quite fills the bill . You see , I like one for one thing and the other for something else . p. 64 ADAM SMITH I see . If you could marry them both , they would add up about a hundred per cent . EVA KING Yes . One to take me to a polo match , and one to take me to the opera . Oh , you understand ? ADAM SMITH Oh , yes ; I understand . I 've met lots of ideal women  --  ideal fifty per cent of the time . But if I ca n't have my hundred per cent girl , I do n't want any . EVA KING Oh , have you found a hundred per cent girl ? ADAM SMITH I 've carried the picture of one around with me a long time . She rode into my dreams when I was up the great river . She was just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's grown real to me . I do n't want one woman to go to a polo match with me , and another to sit by my side when I hear beautiful music . I want her all the time  --  everywhere I go . And most of all I want her to come home to . For , after all , it 's the thought that the woman you love is waiting for you there that makes " home " the most beautiful word in all the languages of the world . EVA KING Why , Father , I had no idea you were so romantic . She says it with a whimsical smile , not really meaning to tease him . ADAM SMITH Romantic ? Yes  --  I suppose I am . You see , being alone a lot forces a chap to live on dreams . p. 65 EVA KING Tell me some more about your dreams . CORINTHIA Enters and announces : Dr. Delamater . EVA KING Ask him in , Corinthia . CORINTHIA exits . ADAM SMITH I 'm afraid I have n't helped you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think you have . ADAM sits in chair and DR . DELAMATER does not see him as he enters . DR . JACK DELAMATER Hello , Eva ! I just got back from that beastly convention and I came right over . EVA KING Good . We thought you were never coming home . DR . JACK DELAMATER Have you missed me ? EVA KING Uncle Horace has been absolutely pining for your return . DR . JACK DELAMATER Oh , Horace  --  And how 's my other patient ? EVA KING Other patient ? DR . JACK DELAMATER Smiling . Father  --   --  EVA KING Oh , father ! Well , you 'll find father a good deal changed . DR . JACK DELAMATER Surprised . Changed ? p. 66 EVA KING Yes ; honestly , we hardly know him . To ADAM . Are n't you going to say how-de do to the doctor , Father ? ADAM SMITH Rises . Good evening , Dr. Delamater . DR . JACK DELAMATER Puzzled . Er , er  --  How do you do , sir ? I 'll be " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Very simple . Mr. King has gone on a long trip and left me in charge of his home and family . I 'm his general manager , Adam Smith . EVA KING We were told to treat him just as we treated father . DR . JACK DELAMATER Really ? I 'm sorry for him . EVA KING And he has full fatherly powers . He can cancel allowances , swear at the dinner table , and any young men who want to marry his daughter have got to come and ask his consent . Indicating ADAM . DR . JACK DELAMATER Oh  --  er  --  Come  --  you 're not serious ? EVA KING But , of course , if he forbids the match and locks me in my room without any supper , there 's nothing to prevent the enterprising lover from returning with a ladder and a license . p. 67 ADAM SMITH You see , Doctor , if I 'm no other use to the family , I 've afforded Miss King a lot of fun teasing me . DR . JACK DELAMATER Well , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may save the rest of us a little . Turns to her . Eva , I want to talk to you privately , if Mr. Smith will excuse us . ADAM SMITH Picking up box . Certainly . I must go and dress . EVA KING To ADAM . No , no , do n't go . Dr. Delamater only wants to propose to me again and I 'm not in the mood for it . ADAM sits down , puts box under table , and commences to go over some accounts . DR . JACK DELAMATER Why , Eva , you 're outrageous ! EVA KING Is n't it true ? DR . JACK DELAMATER Hurt . Very well , then , I 'll say good night ! EVA KING Do n't be offended , Jack . If you 're good , I 'll ask you to dress and come over to dinner . DR . JACK DELAMATER Stiffly . Thanks , but I 'm dining with the er  --  er Logans to-night . CORINTHIA Enters . Lord Andrew Gordon . p. 68 DR . JACK DELAMATER Ah  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KING Do n't be ridiculous , Jack ; and in front of father , too . Show him in , Corinthia . CORINTHIA exits as ADAM starts to rise . EVA KING Do n't go , Father , we may need your help . LORD ANDREW GORDON Enters . Hello , Eva , how'r y'r ? EVA KING Hello , Andy . LORD ANDREW GORDON Shakes his hand  --  DOCTOR is very glum . How'r y'r , Delamater ! How 's the boy ? How 's everything ! How 's medicine ? Sees ADAM . How'r y'r , Mr.  --  Dashed sorry , but I forgot your name . ADAM SMITH Smith . LORD ANDREW GORDON Smith . Funny I should forget that name . I 've known several fellows that belong to your family . EVA KING You 're a trifle early , Andy . Dinner wo n't be for half an hour . LORD ANDREW GORDON Yes , I know ; but there is something I 've been trying to muster up my courage to ask you . DR . DELAMATER steps forward quickly . I 've  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over . p. 69 DR . JACK DELAMATER You 'd better hurry then before the effect wears off . LORD ANDREW GORDON What ? DR . JACK DELAMATER Er  --  nothing ; it 's of no importance . Er  --  good-bye  --  er , Eva . Good-bye , Mr. Smith . Goes toward door . ADAM SMITH Looking up from his figuring . Oh , Doctor , I mailed you a check this morning to cover that last bill of yours . DR . JACK DELAMATER Thanks . It may come in handy to buy a wedding present . Exits . LORD ANDREW GORDON Ho ! What 's the matter with him ? Seems rather unsosh this evening . EVA KING He 's jealous . LORD ANDREW GORDON Ho ! EVA KING And then I am afraid that I hurt his feelings . CORINTHIA enters , carrying a very fine box containing a fashionable dinner gown . Well , Corinthia , what is it now ? CORINTHIA A package . EVA KING For me ? CORINTHIA No , for Mrs. De Witt . EVA KING Well , is n't she upstairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O. D. EVA KING Crosses to her and takes the bill . Oh , yes  --  I 'd forgotten . LORD ANDREW GORDON C. O. D.  --  I say , what does that mean ? EVA KING Call On Dad . Looking at bill . My , this is going to be an awful blow . LORD ANDREW GORDON What ? EVA KING To ANDY . Ssh . EVA crosses to ADAM . Can you spare me a moment from your figures ? CORINTHIA places box on piano bench . ADAM SMITH Looking up . I beg your pardon  --   --  ? EVA KING A bill . Not mine this time , but your older daughter , Julie . ADAM SMITH I 've just been going over the accounts and I 'm afraid we 've been spending too much money . What 's the amount ? EVA KING Take a good brace . Julie 's no piker when she starts an assault on capital . Four hundred and thirty-five . Lays bill before him . JULIE DE WITT Enters . She is wearing a teagown . Oh , good evening , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening , Mrs. De Witt  --   --  JULIE DE WITT Turning to CORINTHIA . Corinthia , I came to ask if my dress has arrived . Collins swore he 'd send it in time for dinner . CORINTHIA Starts opening box . Yes , ma'am , it 's just come . EVA KING Julie , the secretary of the treasury declares our domestic government is facing a deficit . JULIE DE WITT Undoing the box . Really ; Mr. Smith , you mean . ADAM SMITH Uncomfortable . I 'm in a very awkward position , Mrs. De Witt . That package was sent C. O. D. JULIE DE WITT Well , what is the difficulty , Mr. Smith ? Father supplied you with funds to pay our C. O. D. 's , did n't he ? ADAM SMITH Yes , up to a certain amount . But he 's been gone only ten days and we 've already exceeded our month 's allowance . JULIE DE WITT Then we 'll have to start drawing on next month 's . Father grew quite used to that . Takes out dress and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I say  --  that 's a rip-snorter , if you like ! JULIE DE WITT A Poiret model . Nobody else can combine colors like that  --   --  Drapes it on herself . Is n't it a poem ? EVA KING More like a song , I should say . JULIE DE WITT A song ? EVA KING Sweet and low . To ANDY : You see , Julie believes in candor . No secrets among friends ; even where moles and freckles are concerned . ADAM SMITH You say that when you exceeded one month 's allowance your father would let you begin to draw on the next ? JULIE DE WITT Yes . ADAM SMITH Well , that was all right for him ; but I do n't see how I can do it . You see , he limited me and I  --  I 'm very sorry  --   --  Lays bill on table . JULIE DE WITT Holding dress . Then you propose that I should send this dress back ? ADAM SMITH I should think that would be the best solution , yes . JULIE DE WITT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to-night ? p. 73 ADAM SMITH Really I  --  that frock you have on looks very nice to me . JULIE DE WITT A teagown at dinner ! ADAM SMITH I beg pardon . I 'm afraid I 'm not very well up on these things . EVA KING Do n't be a chump , Julie . You know you 've got a closet full of dinner gowns . JULIE DE WITT That 's no reason why I should be treated like a school girl and humiliated by having my purchases sent back . ADAM SMITH If you feel that way about it , Mrs. De Witt , I 'll pay it out of my own account . JULIE DE WITT Oh , please do n't be so preposterous . Swings dress to CORINTHIA , who puts it in the box . Send the dress back . To-morrow I 'll take my pearls up to town and pawn them . I think I can raise enough money to pay my bills until father returns . ADAM SMITH Rises and crosses to her . Oh , no  --  you must n't do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get together and see where we can save . JULIE DE WITT Turns to him . Save ! You talk as if the King Rubber Company were on the verge of ruin . p. 74 LORD ANDREW GORDON Alarmed . It is n't , is it ? JULIE DE WITT ADAM goes to window , raises shade , looks out . There , see ! Take the package back to the man , Corinthia . Though I 'm sure I do n't know what he will think . CORINTHIA Oh , that 's all right , ma'am . They 're quite used to ladies having things sent home on disapproval . She picks up box , starts toward door . JULIE DE WITT Rises , goes to CORINTHIA , fondles the box one moment . Wait , one moment , Corinthia . Looking at ADAM . Tell Parsons that Mr. and Mrs. Logan are dining with us to-night . CORINTHIA At door . How many will that be in all , ma'am ? JULIE DE WITT My uncle and aunt , Mr. and Mrs. Logan , Lord Andrew and my sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ADAM SMITH At window , turns to them . Oh , if I 'm an odd one , I 'll dine later . EVA KING Nonsense . ADAM SMITH Yes , really , I 'd prefer it . It 's much better to have the party properly balanced . p. 75 EVA KING Oh , that makes no difference . JULIE DE WITT But , Eva , if Mr. Smith prefers  --   --  ADAM SMITH Yes , really I do prefer it . You see you 're all old friends and I 'm just an outsider . You 'll have a much jollier time without a parent at the head of the table . JULIE DE WITT Well , if you 're sure you do n't mind ? Turns to CORINTHIA . Lay the table for eight , CORINTHIA ADAM turns to window . CORINTHIA Yes , ma'am . Exits . EVA KING Julie , that 's horrid to make him eat alone . Do n't you think so , Andy ? LORD ANDREW GORDON I should say so . Eating alone always gives me the pip . JULIE DE WITT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . EVA KING Julie ! JULIE DE WITT After suggesting that I dine in a teagown , it seems quite natural that he should prefer to eat his dinner in a bathrobe . Exits . EVA KING I 'm afraid that dinner dress will rankle for some time . p. 76 ADAM SMITH I 'm awfully sorry I hurt her feelings . EVA KING Before you put that check book back , I may as well make my application . ADAM SMITH Certainly , how much do you need , please ? EVA KING I think a hundred and fifty will do . We 're going to teach Andy to play Red Dog after dinner . LORD ANDREW GORDON I 'm always very quick at picking up games . ADAM SMITH Red Dog  --  Is that gambling ? EVA KING Yes . Why ? Do you object to my gambling ? ADAM SMITH I have no reason to object to your gambling , as long as your father does n't mind . EVA KING Oh , I ca n't say father does n't mind . He kicks up an awful fuss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that just like a man who gambles with millions in the rubber market to object to his children playing cards for money ? ADAM SMITH The King Company is forced to gamble in order to protect its supply of raw material ; but if you knew what a risky business it is you would n't wonder that your father dislikes gambling . EVA KING Well , this is an occasion where his feelings are spared . Holds out hand . One hundred and fifty , please . p. 77 ADAM SMITH Miserably . I 'm dreadfully sorry . EVA KING Sorry ? ADAM SMITH Your father left me in charge and I promised him I 'd try and look after his home and family just as he would himself . EVA KING So , because I tell you he objects to my gambling , you wo n't give me any money ? ADAM SMITH I 'll give if to you if you 'll promise you wo n't use it for that purpose . EVA KING Well , if Julie felt like a school girl , I feel like an infant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me " Father . " Please do n't be annoyed the first time I act like one . EVA KING No , I can appreciate a joke , even though it 's on myself ; but when you ask me for promises of good behavior , it is too idiotic to be even funny . However , praises be  --  I also have a pearl necklace . So your lesson in Red Dog is postponed merely until to-morrow , Andy . LORD ANDREW GORDON Righto ! ADAM SMITH Oh , please do n't take it that way , Miss King . I feel perfectly rotten . EVA KING Do n't trouble to apologize . Come out on the terrace , Andy  --  ANDY rises.  --  and you shall tell me what that thing is that is weighing on your mind . p. 78 LORD ANDREW GORDON I do n't know . I do n't think it would be quite judish to tell it while you 're in a bad mood . EVA KING Sharply . Nonsense , I am in the right mood if you only had the sense to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at door . Miss King , please do n't go like that . I 've been awfully clumsy . EVA KING Why , no . You acted very conscientiously and creditably . It 's only that I think I 've had about enough of parental authority . It 's about time I became my own mistress . Exits . ADAM sits down . LORD ANDREW looks at ADAM as though registering his nervousness . LORD ANDREW GORDON Good old Delamater was right  --  it has worn off . ADAM SMITH What 's worn off ? LORD ANDREW GORDON The cocktail . ADAM SMITH Do n't be nervous ; she 's going to take you . LORD ANDREW GORDON Yes , but you see , old chap , I 've never done this thing before . I suppose I ca n't find another anywhere ? ADAM SMITH Ask Corinthia  --   --  p. 79 LORD ANDREW GORDON Righto ! Exits . CORINTHIA enters , carrying a well-laden tray . ADAM goes to tobacco jar and fills pipe . ADAM SMITH What 's the matter , Corinthia ? CORINTHIA Nothing . ADAM SMITH What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ etc . Your dinner . ADAM SMITH It 's awfully kind of you , but really I 'd just as soon wait till after they 're through . CORINTHIA Nonsense , I 've got a couple of nice chops for you , and an artichoke . ADAM SMITH A what ? CORINTHIA You said you 'd like to have a little private practice at eating an artichoke . ADAM SMITH Crossing to table . Oh , that darned thing . Did n't you see how anxious Mrs. De Witt was not to have me sit at table with her society friends , the Logans ? CORINTHIA That was beacuse she was sore at you for not paying for that dress . ADAM SMITH And Miss Eva is sore at me , too , because I asked her to promise not to gamble . They both say they 're going to pawn their jewels to-morrow so they can do what they like . Commences to eat. p. 80 CORINTHIA Yes , that 's what they were always telling their father whenever he threatened not to give them money . ADAM SMITH Gee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . Do you know , Corinthia , these two girls have been so spoiled it 's a wonder that anyone can live with ' em . CORINTHIA Well , it 's Mr. King 's own fault . If he had really wanted to turn his children into something worth while , he 'd have cut their allowances off altogether and made them get out and do some work . ADAM SMITH I wonder ! CORINTHIA Yes , and that goes double for " Clinton " and all the rest of the family . A lot of lazy birds that sit at home in the nest and wait for Mr. King to come and drop food in their mouths . Phone rings . ADAM SMITH Will you answer that , please ? CORINTHIA Goes to phone . Hello  --  Yes , this is Mr. King 's  --  Who ? Yes , Mr. Smith is here . Turns to ADAM . It 's for you , Mr. Smith . The office . ADAM SMITH Rises . The office at this time of night ! Hello  --  oh , is that you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bridgeport factory this afternoon to see that new tire process  --  What 's the matter  --  has anything  --   --  Breaks off . What  --  you do n't mean it ! Where did the prices go to  --  what ? Whistles . That sounds serious . No , I could only get a noon edition up there  --  and there was n't a thing in that  --  Well , I suppose we could head him off by cabling to Mamores , but he could n't do any more than we can ourselves . I told him I thought something like that would happen , but he would n't listen . I guess he 's got a touch of the gambling fever . Yes  --  Oh ! Russell  --  ten o'clock in the morning  --  good-bye .  --  Where 's the evening paper , Corinthia ? CORINTHIA starts to look for it . Oh , yes , I know . Crosses , lifts cushion of chair and takes up paper. p. 81 CORINTHIA Anything the matter ? ADAM SMITH Opening paper to the stock market page . Yes , Mr. King has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Really ? And they wanted to send for him to come back ? ADAM SMITH Yes . Notices the prices are not as low as he feared . He smiles and lowers paper , thoughtfully . I wonder if this is n't the time to  --  No , no , it would n't work . CORINTHIA What would n't work ? ADAM SMITH Still I might say that  --  No , that 's no use either . CORINTHIA Dryly . No , that 's not as good as your first idea . ADAM SMITH Turning away thoughtfully . It would be all right if it were n't for the jewels  --   --  CORINTHIA Jewels ? I beg pardon , sir ADAM SMITH I was just remarking that it 's a very dangerous thing to leave jewels lying round in a house like this . CORINTHIA What have the jewels got to do with what you were just saying about Mr. King ? p. 82 ADAM SMITH Er  --  nothing  --  but I was just reading in the paper that there was a gang of sneak thieves working out here in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the paper . Really ? ADAM SMITH As he runs his finger down stock prices . Yes  --  here 's a whole list of robberies . Sees her looking at paper , folds it up . Why , what is to prevent someone slipping in a cellar window while the family is at dinner ? Mr. De Witt 's room is at the head of the stairs , is n't it ? CORINTHIA Yes , and Miss Eva 's is opposite . ADAM SMITH You mean right across the hall ? Speaking carelessly . But then I suppose they wear their jewels while they are dining , do n't they ? CORINTHIA Not at an informal dinner . It is n't good taste . ADAM SMITH Is n't it ? That 's another of the important things I did n't know . CORINTHIA By the way , it must be about dinner time now . ADAM SMITH Looks at watch . Seven-twenty-five. p. 83 CORINTHIA I 'm afraid I 'll have to leave you . ADAM SMITH Yes , run along . CORINTHIA goes to door . Oh , Corinthia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't they ? CORINTHIA Yes , but these little wall safes are n't much good . ADAM SMITH A good strong screwdriver would fix one of those things . CORINTHIA Besides , they leave them open half the time . ADAM SMITH Leave them open ! I 'll have to speak to them about that . DR . DELAMATER enters . DR . JACK DELAMATER Hello , Mr. Smith . ADAM SMITH Hello , Doctor . Glad to see you back again . CORINTHIA Looks confusedly from one to the other . Excuse me . ADAM SMITH Certainly , Corinthia . CORINTHIA exits . Have a cigar , Doctor ? DR . JACK DELAMATER No , thanks . I 'm dining out . ADAM SMITH You 're dining out to-night , you say  --  Oh , yes , I remember , at the Logans ' . DR . JACK DELAMATER Eh ? Oh , yes  --  yes  --  that 's right  --  the Logans '  --  Looks around cautiously . Mr. Smith , are we quite alone ? p. 84 ADAM SMITH Shut the door , if it 'll make you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think I will . Goes out in the hall and then closes door . That Scotchman is still here , I suppose ? ADAM SMITH Lord Andrew ? Oh , yes , he 's dining here . DR . JACK DELAMATER Mr. Smith , that fellow is a common fortune-hunter . ADAM SMITH Looks at him . Eh ? DR . JACK DELAMATER He 's after Miss King because she 's an heiress . ADAM SMITH I wonder . DR . JACK DELAMATER Well , I know . Now Mr. King asked me to look after Eva . ADAM SMITH Look after her ? DR . JACK DELAMATER But since you 're here in loco parentis  --   --  ADAM SMITH Am I ? I 'm not up in medical terms , Doctor . DR . JACK DELAMATER You 're in the position of father . ADAM SMITH Oh , yes , I 'm father all right . But I 'm afraid I have n't much influence over my family . DR . JACK DELAMATER Oh , I 'm not going to ask you to forbid the match . I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adventurer . It 's pretty drastic , I admit ; but then the prescribe . DR . JACK DELAMATER To begin with , you are Mr. King 's business manager . ADAM nods . So anything you say about the business is going to be pretty conclusive . And then , remember , none of the family knows any more about business than a child . ADAM SMITH I do n't catch your drift , Doctor . DR . JACK DELAMATER Well , I see by the paper that there 's been quite a flurry in the rubber market to-day . ADAM SMITH Flurry hardly describes it . DR . JACK DELAMATER Mr. King was known to be a large speculator . ADAM SMITH Yes  --   --  DR . JACK DELAMATER Why not announce privately to the family that Mr. King is ruined ? ADAM SMITH Eh ? DR . JACK DELAMATER Eva will , of course , tell the Scotchman that she is penniless and as he is penniless , too , he 'll be forced to show his real colors and back out as gracefully as he can . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likes the idea . ADAM SMITH Slowly . You know , Doctor , it 's a darned funny thing that you should propose this . p. 86 DR . JACK DELAMATER Surprised . Yes ? Why ? ADAM SMITH After a second 's pause . Because Mr. King really is ruined . DR . JACK DELAMATER Eh  --  What ? ADAM SMITH That little flurry you spoke about has wiped him out clean . DR . JACK DELAMATER But , good God , man , do you mean to say that with a business like Mr. King 's  --  it 's  --  impossible  --   --  ADAM SMITH Rises . Seems so to me , too . I just ca n't realize it . DR . JACK DELAMATER Why , I 'd always understood King was worth millions . And now you stand there and tell me he 's lost everything ? ADAM SMITH I 'm afraid it 's going to be an awful shock to the family . DR . JACK DELAMATER Shock ? I should say it is a shock ! A soft chime sounds  --  the DOCTOR starts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dinner gong . I thought I would n't tell them till after dinner . It would be a shame to spoil their appetites . DR . JACK DELAMATER Rises . Yes , of course . I 'd better slip out before they come down . I could n't talk to them now as if nothing had happened . Looks around . All this gone  --  just think of it ! What will they do ? p. 87 ADAM SMITH Well , Doctor , I suppose Miss King will marry a man who can look after her . DR . JACK DELAMATER Yes . Yes . She 's an awfully attractive girl . Of course , some fellow is bound to come along  --   --  ADAM SMITH Turning his head rather quickly . To come along ? DR . JACK DELAMATER A trifle embarrassed . Oh  --  when you tell them , please say that if there 's anything on earth I can do to send for me . ADAM SMITH Thank you , Doctor ! DR . JACK DELAMATER And that check for my bill , I shall tear it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . JACK DELAMATER I only wish I could do more , but  --  confidentially  --  my income is much smaller than people suppose  --   --  ADAM SMITH Well , there 's just one bright side to this thing . DR . JACK DELAMATER Yes ? What 's that ? ADAM SMITH Miss Eva will be quite safe from fortunehunters . He looks at the DOCTOR again. p. 88 DR . JACK DELAMATER Yes  --  yes  --  the Scotchman  --   --  ADAM SMITH Yes  --   --  DR . JACK DELAMATER I 'd almost forgotten about him . ADAM SMITH Yes , yes ; so had I , until you just mentioned it . DR . JACK DELAMATER He 'll go , of course . ADAM SMITH Yes , yes , he 'll go . DR . JACK DELAMATER More briskly . Well , do n't forget if there 's anything I can do  --   --  ADAM SMITH Thanks . DR . JACK DELAMATER Good night . ADAM SMITH Good night . DR . JACK DELAMATER At door . Oh ! Mr. Smith  --   --  ADAM SMITH Yes . DR . JACK DELAMATER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's fine of you , Doctor  --   --  DR . JACK DELAMATER Good night , Mr. Smith . ADAM SMITH Good night . DELAMATER exits . ADAM looks after him a moment , grins , and throws cigar on table , disgusted . He opens drawer of table , absently takes out pipe , lights it , sees the paperknife , picks it up . Then he thinks of the small safe containing the jewels , tests the strength of the blade  --  smiles , nods his head  --  taps the knife with his hand . He looks about to show he is unobserved and then goes out . The CURTAIN falls and remains lowered a few seconds to denote the passing of an hour. p. 89 p. 90 Act 2 , Scene 2 SCENE II : After dinner . UNCLE HORACE is sitting in the most comfortable chair in the room , his hands folded over his newspaper . His eyes are closed . At a table on the other side of room , EVA , CLINTON and LORD ANDREW are playing Red Dog . All are in evening dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audience . The card-table is in front of her . LORD ANDREW is sitting at the right of this table and CLINTON at the left . There is a pencil , several I. O. U. 's and a match-and-ash-holder on the table . The cards have been dealt . LORD ANDREW is holding his hand up , studying it intently . All at sea , he gives his long drawn-out whistle , pauses , repeats the whistle . They look at him despairingly ; he again repeats the whistle . LORD ANDREW GORDON I say  --   --  Takes out a card , puts it back again  --  repeats the whistle . What do I do when I 've got a jack and two queens ? EVA KING For heaven 's sake , Andy , do n't tell us what cards you 've got . LORD ANDREW GORDON I 'm awfully sorry and all that , but it seems so thunderin ' complicated . My mind is in a pretty upset condish , anyway  --   --  CLINTON DE WITT I know , old boy . I remember the day that Julie and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The thing to do is to take a good stiff drink . p. 91 LORD ANDREW GORDON I think I will . HORACE PIGRIM Opening his eyes . Yes , and wrap yourself up in a blanket and put your feet in hot mustard and water . LORD ANDREW GORDON What ? EVA KING He has n't got a cold , Uncle . HORACE PIGRIM No ? Then what has he got ? EVA KING He 's got engaged to me ! HORACE PIGRIM Casually . Oh ! EVA KING And I must say I 'm not flattered to be talked about as if I were a symptom , and having a man say he needs a drink of whisky to face the prospect of marrying me . LORD ANDREW GORDON Oh , come now , Eva . Nobody said that you were a symptom . I did n't say she was a symptom , did I ? CLINTON DE WITT Yes  --  no . I do n't know  --   --  LORD ANDREW GORDON I know I did n't ; I did n't say you were a symptom . EVA KING @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ANDREW GORDON But the idea of being engaged sort of staggers a fellow if he 's been a bachelor ever since he was born . p. 92 CLINTON DE WITT Of course , it does . I have n't got accustomed to the idea of being married , even yet . EVA KING No ? How long does a man have to be out on the sea of matrimony before he gets his sea-legs ? HORACE PIGRIM With eyes closed . Most men never get used to marriage ; they just get reconciled . LORD ANDREW GORDON Oh , I say , you must n't talk like that . EVA KING Never mind Uncle Horace . He ca n't appreciate love 's young dream . He 's got hyperacidity . HORACE PIGRIM All right . I only hope love 's young dream looks just as pink after the honeymoon is over and you 've settled down to ordinary existence . EVA KING Oh , but ours is going to be a perpetual honeymoon , eh , Andy ? LORD ANDREW GORDON You betcha . Is it my turn to play ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honeymoon before . Believe me , you 'll know when it 's over  --  when he begins to kiss you as if you were hot soup . EVA KING I 'll bet five dollars . LORD ANDREW GORDON That makes a pretty rich pot . Fifty dollars ! p. 93 CLINTON DE WITT I 'll bet the pot . EVA KING What have you got ? CLINTON DE WITT Turning card . The king . You lose . Hurray ! LORD ANDREW GORDON You 've got all the luck this evening . EVA KING Writing it out . You 'll have to take my I. O. U. for my share , Clinton . I 'm flat , stony broke to-night and I do n't feel I want to begin asking Andy for money yet . LORD ANDREW GORDON I 've got a dollar or two knocking around somewhere . The good old Pater is a bit behind with my remittance again , as usual . AUNT ABBY ROOKER Enters . Hello ! Where 's the rest of the party ? EVA KING Oh , someone phoned over to the Logans to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of course , they rushed off home in a panic . HORACE PIGRIM Silly people , making such a fuss about nothing . And when I was describing my sufferings not a bit of interest or sympathy . AUNT ABBY ROOKER And where 's Julie ? CLINTON DE WITT Julie 's off getting out invitations for the announcement party , I guess . p. 94 LORD ANDREW GORDON I 'll bet a shilling . EVA KING Sister Julie is in her element with a big social function to direct . I really believe she 's happier about the engagement than I am . I 'm quite sure she 's happier than Andy . LORD ANDREW GORDON Do n't be redick . You know that is n't true . AUNT ABBY ROOKER Crossing to couch she arranges pillows comfortably and reclines . Julie certainly loves society . CLINTON DE WITT I do n't know . Was it your turn , Eva ? EVA KING She told me once that she admired you because you were the sort of a man who would n't even phone a girl unless you were properly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  EVA KING Clinton ! LORD ANDREW GORDON The closer the what ? CLINTON DE WITT Why the closer  --  never mind  --   --  Giving it up . I know she likes a man to be correct and well turned out . That 's why I think it was so unfair of your father to put the house in charge of this bounder who wears tie-clips and purple socks and does n't know how to eat properly . p. 95 EVA KING Indignantly . Mr. Smith does know how to eat properly . It 's perfectly natural , after living in a wilderness for eight or ten years , that lots of the little , unimportant things should seem strange to him . And I daresay you 're one of the things that seem the strangest . CLINTON DE WITT Since when have you become his champion ? EVA KING I 'm not his champion ; in fact , I  --  I rather dislike him . But I ca n't stand hearing a real man sneered at because he does n't dress in the latest Bond Street style . LORD ANDREW @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and attempts to blow them off . Most of the ashes go to CLINTON . Speaking personally , I 'm strong for jolly old Smith . CLINTON DE WITT Hear  --  hear ! He tries to blow the ashes back , instead blows his I. O. U. 's on floor . Stoops hastily to recover them . ADAM SMITH Entering . He is in immaculate evening dress . Good evening , everybody  --  May I come in ? AUNT ABBY ROOKER Reclining on couch . Good evening , Mr. Smith . p. 96 CLINTON DE WITT In surprise . Hullo ! HORACE PIGRIM Opens eyes , looks at the apparition . Well , I 'm damned ! All dressed for the party ? ADAM SMITH What party ? HORACE PIGRIM The engagement party . LORD ANDREW GORDON Yes , rather  --   --  HORACE PIGRIM He landed her or she landed him ; I do n't know which way it was . ADAM SMITH May I offer you a father 's blessing ? LORD ANDREW GORDON Thanks , old chap  --   --  EVA KING Do n't let 's play any longer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may as well stop . ADAM SMITH Please do n't break up the game on my account . EVA KING It is n't on your account . Rises . I 'm not in the mood for cards . LORD ANDREW GORDON Holds her hand a second as she rises . I 'm afraid that 's because I 'm such a priceless duffer . But I tell you what ! I can do some awfully good card tricks , if you like . EVA KING Not this evening , thank you , Andy . p. 97 AUNT ABBY ROOKER Perhaps you 'd like to play to us , Eva ? CLINTON DE WITT Pious idea . The atmosphere is a bit depressing . EVA KING Going to piano . Piqued at ADAM 'S attitude . Yes , Mr. Smith is the only one that seems to be thoroughly cheerful and contented . But then , Mr. Smith is no doubt thrilled by this charming picture of American home life . She plays a few bars of " Home , Sweet Home . " Is n't this what you always dreamed of : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the family gathered about you ? ADAM SMITH Bursting out . Do n't , please . I ca n't stand it ! EVA stops playing abruptly . There is a general stir of surprise . EVA KING I 'm sorry . She thinks that it is the situation of her being engaged to LORD ANDREW that he " ca n't stand , " and she really is sorry for having drawn forth this strange outburst . ADAM SMITH I ca n't bear to-night , of all nights , that you should speak of your home scoffingly , as though you did n't prize it . EVA KING To-night of all nights ? You mean because I 've just become engaged ? p. 98 ADAM SMITH Oh , it 's too damnably ironical . My dear people , I do n't know how to tell you . AUNT ABBY ROOKER How to tell us what ? Apprehensively , as she looks at his face . What 's the matter , Mr. Smith ? HORACE PIGRIM He 's sick . ADAM SMITH I 've been trying to muster my courage to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give myself another reason for delay . But it 's no use stalling any longer . You 've got to know . EVA KING Really alarmed . Why , Mr. Smith , you do n't  --   --  HORACE PIGRIM Breaking in . Your father 's boat has gone down ! Just what I dreamed this afternoon . ADAM SMITH No , Mr. King is all right . That is to say , he 's safe and well . HORACE PIGRIM Go on , then , explode your bomb and bury our fragments . ADAM SMITH My dear people , Mr. King is ruined . ALL Ruined ? AUNT ABBY ROOKER Did he say ruined ? CLINTON DE WITT Not really ruined ? There is a moment 's hushed silence . ADAM nods his head slowly. p. 99 AUNT ABBY ROOKER It 's incredible , fantastic ! LORD ANDREW GORDON I say , does " ruined " mean the same thing here that it does in England ? ADAM SMITH Yes , I mean financially ruined . EVA KING But how  --  how could it happen ? Surely he ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days . ADAM SMITH The Brazilian Government placed an embargo on rubber shipments ; that means a nation-wide shortage of raw material . This afternoon prices soared to the skies . The King Company is carrying a tremendous short account and that account has got to be covered if it takes every dollar . LORD ANDREW GORDON Every dollar ? CLINTON DE WITT But look here , Brazil has no right to do this to us . LORD ANDREW GORDON No , I say , ca n't you get the good old U. S. A. to send some battleships ? That 's what we always do in England . EVA KING Have you sent for father ? ADAM SMITH No . He 's probably way up the river by this time , and he wo n't hear of it till he reaches Manouse . AUNT ABBY ROOKER Does it mean that everything has gone ? ADAM nods his head . His private fortune ? p. 100 ADAM SMITH I 'm afraid there is no private fortune . It is all in the business . Perhaps we can save the home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be kept up . We 've got to rent it . HORACE PIGRIM Rises . Rent it ? CLINTON DE WITT Good God ! HORACE PIGRIM Then where the devil are we going to live ? CLINTON DE WITT And how are we going to live ? ADAM SMITH That 's the problem we 've got to face . AUNT ABBY ROOKER Well , there 's only one thing to do . We 'll just have to wait till Mr. King comes back . CLINTON DE WITT Yes . Sits down . HORACE PIGRIM Yes . Sits down . LORD ANDREW GORDON Yes . Sits down . ADAM SMITH You actually propose to sit down and fold your hands until Mr. King gets back to earn your living for you ? CLINTON DE WITT Well , if we do n't know how to earn it ourselves ? ADAM SMITH You 'll have to do like other people , Mr. De Witt , and find out how . Mr. King is over fifty years old . All his life he has worked for his family  --  for you . He has supported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home that none of you appreciate because you 've never had to do without it . He 's given you education , food , clothes  --  everything you asked for within reason  --  and a great deal that was out of reason . And now after years of office drudgery , of fighting and struggling for you , are you going to ask him to start in all over again  --  at his age  --  with a family hanging around his neck ? p. 101 EVA KING Rises  --  turns to ADAM . Of course , we 're not , Mr. Smith . Though I do n't blame you for thinking us quite capable of it . ADAM SMITH I beg your pardon . I had no right to talk to you that way . After all , I 'm only an outsider . EVA KING We 'll be glad if you wo n't consider yourself an outsider . You see we 're a dreadfully helpless crowd , and we shall need someone with business experience to advise us . ADAM SMITH Goes to EVA . That 's what I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 've been with him ever since I was a kid and he 's been so damned white to me . I beg your pardon  --   --  EVA KING That 's all right . HORACE PIGRIM I 'm glad to hear somebody use a cuss word . Relieves the atmosphere . EVA KING If father had only taught us to do something . It seems funny to think that all those servants back there in the kitchen have a much better chance of earning their living than we have . LORD ANDREW GORDON Slight pause . It 's the devil of a posish for a whole family to be suddenly plunged into . JULIE enters hysterically. p. 102 JULIE DE WITT Oh , oh , the most terrible thing has happened . HORACE PIGRIM Yes , we know . JULIE DE WITT You know ? CLINTON DE WITT Is n't it ghastly , darling . We 're just stunned  --  absolutely stunned . JULIE DE WITT But how did you find out ? EVA KING Mr. Smith told us . JULIE DE WITT Putting hands to her head . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovered it myself . I went to the safe to put away my rings and I found it empty . HORACE PIGRIM Empty ? AUNT ABBY ROOKER What on earth are you talking about ? JULIE DE WITT The robbery , of course ! ALL Robbery ! JULIE DE WITT And Eva 's necklace has gone , too . EVA KING What ! CLINTON DE WITT Calmly . That 's damned funny , is n't it ? LORD ANDREW GORDON Dashed strange coincidence . JULIE DE WITT Good heavens , but you 're all taking it pretty calmly . Do you fully realize what has happened ? Eva 's safe was broken open  --  mine apparently had n't been properly closed ! p. 103 CLINTON DE WITT Too bad ! JULIE DE WITT To Clinton . Too bad ! My God , is that all you can say ? EVA KING Julie , we ca n't get very excited about your news . It seems a mere pinprick after the blow we 've just received . JULIE DE WITT To EVA . Blow ! What blow ? CLINTON DE WITT When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit serious . You know we could have lived a long time on the money those jewels would have fetched . JULIE DE WITT We could have lived a long time  --  what do you mean ? EVA KING Takes her hand . Julie , that robbery has only completed our ruin . Father has lost all his money  --  everything . JULIE DE WITT Who says so ? EVA KING Mr. Smith . JULIE DE WITT Steps forward . Oh , let me sit down . I think I 'm going to faint . She collapses weakly on the couch , leans her head back and closes her eyes ; ABBY goes to her , pats her hand ; CLINTON also rushes to her. p. 104 CLINTON DE WITT I 'll get the smelling salts . It will be a relief to do something . HORACE PIGRIM It 'll be a relief to see you do something . CLINTON DE WITT Well , I 've never noticed you perspiring from hard work , Mr. Pigrim . Exit CLINTON . ADAM SMITH Taking receiver from hook . Well , I suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GORDON Crosses to ADAM  --  excitedly : Let me do that . I feel like De Witt . Must do something . Takes phone from ADAM . Hello  --   --  Lowers phone . What 's their number ? No . I 'll run up and take a look at the scene of the crime . Perhaps I may pick up a clue . I 've always been a great hand at solving puzzles . EVA KING Yes , do , go , Andy . It 'll be a good way to keep you occupied . LORD ANDREW GORDON I 'll take a good look around the flower-bed for footprints . Who knows , these detective Johnnies may be jolly glad to have my co-op before I 'm through . LORD ANDREW exits . HORACE PIGRIM I know the sort of detecting jobs he 'd be equal to ! Watching for shoplifters in a piano-store. p. 105 EVA KING Well , Julie . I guess your great announcement party will never come off . Unless we use it to announce the King family has gone broke . ADAM SMITH Rises . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He breaks off , not knowing how to express it tactfully . EVA KING Will back out of the engagement ? What is he to do ? No , Mr. Smith , I do n't think I 'd better count on being supported by Lord Andrew Gordon . CLINTON renters , carrying the smelling salts , which he uncorks and holds under JULIE 'S nose . JULIE has , however , partially recovered , already . AUNT ABBY ROOKER Then what will you do  --   --  EVA KING Why , there 's only one thing to do  --  we must all go to work . JULIE DE WITT Do n't tell me it is as bad as all that  --   --  Pushing away the smelling salts . Thank you , Clinnie ; ' s enough . CLINTON sits , smelling the salts . AUNT ABBY ROOKER Goes to EVA . There 's always Dr. Delamater , so you 're all right  --  but , I doubt if my matrimonial possibilities are very bright . p. 106 HORACE PIGRIM What about me ? A penniless but warm-hearted bachelor with a bad digestion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widow  --  " object , matrimony . " I 'll get a hell of a lot of answers to that ! CLINTON DE WITT That suggests something to me . Suppose we all look in the papers . JULIE DE WITT What for , dear ? CLINTON DE WITT Want Ads  --   --  Picks up paper on floor in front of UNCLE HORACE . UNCLE HORACE quickly picks up the rest of the papers and holds them on his lap . I 've often noticed whole pages of " Help Wanted " and " Business Opportunities . " JULIE DE WITT Admiringly . Oh , Clinnie , what a man you are in an emergency . ADAM SMITH Yes , it 's a great idea , Mr. De Witt . You can spare us a couple of these , ca n't you , Mr. Pigrim ? Takes two papers from him , crosses to EVA , gives her one and then opens other paper to " Help Wanted " page . JULIE DE WITT Of course , I might go on the stage . AUNT ABBY ROOKER My dear Julie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's had her jewels stolen . p. 107 ADAM SMITH Folding down a paper . " Help Wanted  --  Female . " Here you are , Miss Rooker . Hands it to ABBY , who takes it vaguely . EVA KING What a surprise it will be to poor old Dad to come back and find us all working . They each have a paper except JULIE and ADAM . ADAM SMITH Goes to look over EVA 'S paper , which she has opened on the table . Yes , and I 'm going to propose that if your father does n't come of his own accord we wo n't send for him . JULIE DE WITT Why ? ADAM SMITH He needs that rest and needs it badly . EVA KING But surely when he hears about the embargo ? ADAM SMITH He may not realize what it means . He probably wo n't get the market quotations down there and I shall try and reassure him until we 've straightened things out a bit . EVA KING When he hears that we 've all been helping  --  everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will give him courage . HORACE PIGRIM Lowering his paper . Say , does it take long to learn to tune pianos ? p. 108 ADAM SMITH I do n't know . AUNT ABBY ROOKER Oh , wait a minute . There 's something that might do for Clinton . JULIE rises  --  leans over table . " Young man wanted  --  nine hundred a year . " CLINTON DE WITT Nine hundred a year ? What could I do with that ? Leaving Julile out of the question , it will cost me at least fifteen hundred a year just to live . HORACE PIGRIM I should n't pay that , if I were you . It is n't worth it . CLINTON DE WITT What ? EVA KING Looking through . There are a lot of social secretaries wanted ; but everyone expects them to know shorthand . CLINTON DE WITT Ah , listen to this . " Young man , you belong with us . This is the golden opportunity you have been waiting for  --  a newly patented article as easy to sell as beer at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a catch in it . ADAM SMITH What 's the matter with that one ? CLINTON DE WITT " Must have a large acquaintance . " JULIE DE WITT Well , you 've got a very large acquaintance . p. 109 CLINTON DE WITT " Must have a large acquaintance among hot-water bottle manufacturers . " JULIE DE WITT How silly ! As though anybody in the world would be likely to know more than two or three hot-water bottle manufacturers . I go about a great deal and I 've never met one . EVA KING Is n't it funny ; we 're all sitting around here as if we were playing a game . All are intently studying the " Wants Ads . " ADAM SMITH And it 's a lot more fun than Red Dog , is n't it ? EVA KING Of course , the truth of the matter is , we just ca n't realize the disaster  --  yet . AUNT ABBY ROOKER No , we 'll wake up to that later on . JULIE DE WITT Well , I suppose I ought to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a paper . They probably wo n't give CLINTON what he 's worth  --  just at first . HORACE PIGRIM Let 's hope they wo n't . ADAM SMITH Looking through EVA 'S paper on cardtable . Oh , here 's something that will interest you , Mr. De Witt . " Wanted  --  Clothing salesman ; must be a snappy dresser. " p. 110 CLINTON DE WITT Disgustedly . Snappy dresser ? JULIE DE WITT Go on , Mr. Smith . How much does it pay ? ADAM SMITH Continuing . " Splendid terms to the right party . Exceptional opportunity to demonstrate our line of clothing novelties to the boys who like gingery effects . A side line of fancy belts , scarfpins , tie-clips , and other gents ' jewelry . Will net a livewire from seven to ten dollars a day . The New Era Clothing Co. , Akron , Ohio . " JULIE DE WITT You 'd better answer that one , dear ; it says " exceptional opportunity . " CLINTON DE WITT Protestingly . But , Julie  --   --  JULIE DE WITT Now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work , you ca n't afford to be too critical , can he , Mr. Smith ? ADAM SMITH No . But I ca n't see Mr. De Witt selling tie-clips and other gents ' jewelry . CLINTON DE WITT Throws his paper on piano . I 'll do anything for Julie . Kisses JULIE . Where is that ad ? ADAM SMITH Crosses to CLINTON , shows him ad in paper . Good boy . p. 111 JULIE DE WITT That 's right and I 'm going into business , too . I think I 'll put on my best hat to-morrow and go straight down to Wall Street . EVA KING Dryly . Yes , the best hat is so important . JULIE DE WITT Rises . Of course , it is . Appearance is everything . At least I 've always heard so . Mr. Smith , is it true that pretty girls do better in business than plain girls ? ADAM SMITH Well , I do n't know . I guess it 's about a toss-up . The plain girls do n't make so many mistakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty girls make . JULIE DE WITT Ah , that 's just what I supposed . EVA KING Looking through the Want Ads . The only job I can find that does n't need experience is a shop assistant  --   --  With decision . I shall make a try for that . ADAM SMITH Crossing toEVA . Oh , great Scott  --  no ! I ca n't let you do that . I mean you must n't do that . EVA KING Why not ? ADAM SMITH Because you must n't . You do n't realize what it would be like to stand behind a counter all day . p. 112 EVA KING Well , if other girls can do it , I can . ADAM SMITH No , no , wait a minute . Tell me , does n't your father own an old place over in New Jersey ? EVA KING Yes . He 's kept it out of sentiment . It 's the place where he spent his boyhood . ADAM SMITH Why could n't we turn it into a chicken farm ? EVA KING I believe there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large scale . For instance , special brands of eggs for invalids , packed in fancy boxes and delivered by express . And honey the same way . Have little jars shaped like a beehive . You and Mrs. De Witt could run it . It would be better than taking some ill-paid job as a secretary or companion . EVA KING What a splendid idea ! JULIE DE WITT Yes , is n't it ? And I know all about bees since I read that book of Maeterlinck 's . Oh ! Clinnie , have you read Maeterlinck 's " Life of the Bee " ? So fascinating  --  and the part about the Queen Bee and her young lover is deliciously risqu . Poor dear , just like Cleopatra , she always murders him after the honeymoon . ADAM SMITH Really , I think with your acquaintance to help get the thing started we could make a " go " of it . p. 113 HORACE PIGRIM Aha ! Here I am at last ! Reads . " Wanted  --  A middle-aged man of pleasing personality . Must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hm , I wonder  --  This does n't sound quite respectable . JULIE DE WITT Oh , what is it ? HORACE PIGRIM " Prefer one who is accustomed to handling Georgette undergarments . " AUNT ABBY ROOKER Really , Horace  --   --  HORACE PIGRIM Reading another . " Good pay for a wideawake man . " That certainly describes me , too . If they can find anyone who stays awake longer than I do , they 'll be doing well . CLINTON DE WITT I 've got four or five to answer . I think I 'll go and write now . Goes up to door . HORACE PIGRIM Rising . Yes , I suppose they all expect immediate replies . Turns to them . If anyone else is coming to the study they 've got to keep quiet . CLINTON DE WITT What 'll you bet , Uncle Horace , that you land a job before I do ? HORACE PIGRIM A hundre  --   --  Thinks of his bet with KING ; changes for luck . No , ten dollars . p. 114 CLINTON DE WITT You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letters together . HORACE PIGRIM Yes , that 's agreed . CLINTON goes out . UNCLE HORACE turns , and whispers to others . I 'm going to telegraph . Exits . EVA KING Well , Aunt Abby , how does the bee and chicken farm appeal to you ? AUNT ABBY ROOKER Well , I think I 'd better take a position , at any rate for a little while . Perhaps after you 've got things going well you may find you need another to help . EVA KING And , Mr. Smith , will you come out occasionally and see how we 're getting on ? ADAM SMITH Above card-table . Occasionally ? I was hoping you 'd let me board with you . ABBY and JULIE shudder at the idea of taking boarders . I can build chicken-coops on Sundays and help a bit with the business details . EVA KING Oh , that 'll be splendid , if you will ! ADAM SMITH Mr. De Witt and I will commute together . LORD ANDREW enters . LORD ANDREW GORDON Well , I have n't found anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the police ? LORD ANDREW GORDON Rather . They 'll be over here in a jiffy . JULIE DE WITT Getting up , languidly . I suppose I 'd better tell Corinthia to tidy things up a little . I left the room in an awful mess . LORD ANDREW GORDON Shall I ring for her ? JULIE DE WITT Thanks . He turns toward the bell on wall . Oh , no , no  --  wait a moment . I 've got to learn to do without servants . Rising . I 'll attend to it myself . EVA KING Bravo , Julie ! There 's some life in the King blood after all , Mr. Smith ! ADAM SMITH I should say there is . AUNT ABBY ROOKER Rises . And I 'm going upstairs and phone to my friend , Mrs. Wilcox . She has a gouty father and I heard her say yesterday that he needs a combination husekeeper and invalid 's companion . EVA KING That horrid old man ! Oh , Aunty ! They say he 's impossible to get along with . AUNT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't be much worse than Horace . I 'll say good night , Lord Andrew . p. 116 LORD ANDREW GORDON Good night ! AUNT ABBY ROOKER Good night , Mr. Smith . ADAM SMITH Good night , Miss Rooker . You 've all been wonderfully brave through this . AUNT ABBY ROOKER Yes , I 've tried to brave , but I do wish  --  ADAM SMITH Yes  --  ? AUNT ABBY ROOKER I do wish that someone would come up and look under my bed . LORD ANDREW starts forward  --  thinks better of it  --  turns . I 'm terribly afraid of burglars . JULIE DE WITT I 'll look for you ! I only wish I could find one . Just imagine what a difference it would make if we could get those jewels back . ADAM SMITH Yes , would n't it ? JULIE DE WITT Good night , everybody . I used to think family life was awfully tiresome and bourgeoise ; but now that it 's quite possibly the last night we 'll ever spend all together in the old home  --  EVA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . AUNT ABBY ROOKER At door . We never really appreciate anything until we lose it . She sniffs as if dangerously near tears , and goes out. p. 117 JULIE DE WITT Never mind . I 'm just going to love the chickens and the bees . I simply adore keeping pets . Exits . ADAM SMITH Starts . I suppose I 'd better go and leave you two together . EVA KING No , no . There wo n't be any affecting scenes of parting . Andy and I are just going to shake hands and say " good-bye . " ADAM at cardtable , sits on right arm of chair and starts to play solitaire . LORD ANDREW GORDON " Good-bye "  --  what 's this ? I do n't quite follow . EVA KING Of course , Andy , do n't let 's pretend . You 're too much of a gentleman , I know , to back out yourself ; but it 's no use , is it ? You 're poor  --  LORD ANDREW GORDON I know . I have n't a shilling , still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go on being engaged . LORD ANDREW GORDON Still , if you do n't mind long engagements . Do you know I had an aunt that was engaged for twenty-five years . EVA KING Smiling . Well , I must say that the prospect  --   --  LORD ANDREW GORDON An ' , you know , that even after they were married they used to sit on the drawing room sofa , holding hands . They 'd have sat there all night if the servants had n't come in and reminded them to go to bed . p. 118 ADAM SMITH Smiling . Habit is a wonderful thing . LORD ANDREW GORDON I say  --  look here . I 'm going to make a confesh . I came over here to America with the idea of marrying money . That 's true , absolutely . But I 've found out to-night that the money has n't a dashed thing to do with the way I feel about you . EVA KING Why , Andy , that 's very nice of you  --  but  --   --  LORD ANDREW GORDON So , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to be naturalized and settle down in America , an-an-an  --  and get a job . ADAM AND EVA ADAM rises . A job ? LORD ANDREW GORDON A trifle seriously . Yes . You wo n't think any the less of me for working , will you ? And , of course , I 'll have to drop the title  --   --  EVA KING Andy , you 're a dear ! ADAM SMITH Holding out his hand . Put it there , old man . I 'll never say a word against the Scotch as long as I live . LORD ANDREW GORDON Thank you . ADAM SMITH Speaking about a job , you 're in the navy , are n't you ? p. 119 LORD ANDREW GORDON Naval Reserve . They do n't want me any longer . I do n't know just what I can do , but I know a deuce of a lot about horses . EVA KING Really , it 's like a dream . Doorbell rings . LORD ANDREW GORDON Ah , there 's the police . I 'll have to go and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KING But  --  one minute , Andy . Your family ; surely they are counting on you ? LORD ANDREW GORDON To bring home an heiress ? Yes , I suppose they are . But then , I 've been a sore disappointment to my family from the very first . Will you believe it , they had it all planned out to christen me Victoria and marry me to a duke . Speaks into hall . Ah , are you the officer I spoke to on the phone ? Speaks to Eva . Perhaps , you 'd better come up and show them about the safe . You see , I do n't understand the combination . LORD ANDREW goes out . EVA KING All right , Andy . She turns to ADAM . Well , he went through . ADAM SMITH He sure did . And it 's worth it all to know for certain that you 're not throwing yourself away . You 're marrying a man who 's made of the real stuff . p. 120 EVA KING Yes , and I 'd be a little beast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 've got to go through , too . ADAM SMITH Yes , of course . EVA KING Well , I think I 'd better go . She exits to hall . ADAM stands , thinking it over . He looks about to see that no one is coming . Then looks for a place in which to hide the jewels for the present . Sees bookcase over fireplace . Crosses to it . Stands on fender , feels back of the books for a place to drop them . Comes to center table , still careful that no one sees him , takes white handkerchief from the outside breast pocket of his dress coat , and carefully pulls out two pearl necklaces and three diamond rings . Looks at them a second , then takes an envelope from writing set on table and is about to drop them into it as Eva enters . EVA KING As she enters . The men are upstairs , and I think you had better  --   --  ADAM looks up and drops necklace into the envelope . She sees it . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is quite simple , Miss King . I am the man who took these jewels . Holds them in his hand. p. 121 EVA KING Yes , but why ? ADAM SMITH These jewels mean you do n't have to work . EVA looks at him . None of you . You can live on the money they fetch until your father gets back , and starts in again . He hands the jewels to her , she takes them mechanically . EVA KING These jewels would be a big help to Dad . You want us to keep them and give them to him . That 's it , is n't it ? ADAM SMITH It will be great if you can . EVA KING Can ? Of course we can . Offers them to him  --  he does not take them . Take them back . I wo n't say a word to the others . ADAM SMITH You mean that ? EVA KING I suppose we may have a rather hard time at first . It would be a temptation if they knew we still had these . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no , but we 'll see if the Kings ca n't go through , like Andy did . ADAM takes the jewels . She looks at him a moment . Good night , Father . ADAM SMITH I am glad I am something to you . EVA KING I did n't say it that time to tease you . I just want to tell you how grateful I am for all you 've done for me  --  for us  --  p. 122 ADAM SMITH " Me " was right . EVA KING You 've been  --  what was your expression ?  --  " damned white . " EVA turns and exits , as he stands staring after her. @x TIME : Thanksgiving Day . Three months later . SCENE : The Chicken Farm in New Jersey . A pretty , old-fashioned back garden nestling in the angle of a New Jersey farmhouse . Half red stone and half gray shingles , with the characteristic Dutch roof and a long lean-to , consisting of woodshed and scullery . The trees , wherever visible , display the tints of late autumn and are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on one side of the stage , with steps descending to the cellar . A little out-house , extending partly across the back , is used for storing the pots of honey and the egg boxes before they are shipped away . On the side facing the house are extensive chicken runs ; beyond which is seen a pleasant stretch of country , all in the golden haze of a late , but warm , November day . A quite elaborate coop , which is to be used for exhibiting prize Dorkings , is standing to one side , awaiting a final coat of paint . As the curtain rises , JULIE and CORINTHIA , drawn together in the democracy of the business undertaking , are bustling about preparing a shipment of eggs . JULIE DE WITT Sitting on seat at post , examining the order book . I wish that old bird would keep quiet . CORINTHIA Shaping crush boxes . Never mind . It probably means that he knows another egg has been laid . p. 124 JULIE DE WITT Yes , just like a man to crow about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaves order book on seat  --  goes to table and points to honey-box on chair . We 'd better send this box to Cobb , Bates and Yurxa . The order from Charles only came last night . CORINTHIA All right . Looks about on table . Do you know where the stencil is , ma'am ? JULIE DE WITT Protestingly . Corinthia ! CORINTHIA Goes to porch , looks about for the stencils , finally finds them under pillow on end of settee . Selects one , takes stencil brush and paint pan from top of egg-box on porch . Stencils honey-box on chair . Apologetically : It 's so difficult for me to say it . Really , I 'll never get used to it . JULIE DE WITT But it 's ridiculous to call me " ma'am . " You came out here when we could n't afford to pay you any wages and did ten times as much work as Eva and I  --  and now you 're a partner in the business . CORINTHIA You 've been awfully kind . JULIE DE WITT Takes up order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just good business sense . But partners must be equals ! Adam says that 's the very first principle . p. 125 CORINTHIA Would you mind reading off the address , Julie ? JULIE DE WITT Ah , that 's better . Cobb , Bates and Yurxa  --  Yurxa  --  Y-u-r-x-a  --  Summer street , Boston . CORINTHIA Prints the address on tag on box . Thanks . As soon as I get through with this I 've got to get Mr. Smith to look at that new incubator . JULIE DE WITT Yes , ask Adam to fix it ; he knows everything . CORINTHIA Places honey-box she has stenciled on porch . Is n't it wonderful  --  all he manages to do for us ? You 'd think after working all day in the city he 'd be too tired to fuss round with chickenruns and beehives . JULIE DE WITT And he 's teaching me bookkeeping . It 's really quite fascinating . CORINTHIA Is it difficult ? JULIE DE WITT Not very . I 'm starting on double-entry next week . CORINTHIA What 's double-entry ? JULIE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thing down on one side of the ledger and then you contradict it on the other . CORINTHIA Sounds too much for me . Tell me , has Mr. Smith said how things are going at the office ? p. 126 JULIE DE WITT No , but he 's managed to keep the company from going into the hands of a receiver . CORINTHIA Receiver ? JULIE DE WITT Yes , a man who receives . That 's another business term . CORINTHIA Stamping the eggs . And what happens if the business falls into the clutches of a receiver ? JULIE DE WITT Not cluthes  --  hands . I believe they do n't have to be necessarily dishonest . CORINTHIA Did n't that detective say he thought your jewels had got into the hands of a receiver ? JULIE DE WITT Receiver of stolen goods . Ah , that 's a slightly different kind . CORINTHIA I 'm no good at business . JULIE DE WITT Well , you can leave that to me  --  I love it . I 've never spent a happier summer in all my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to the style favored by the more daring youths of the rural communities . Buttoned flaps on all the pockets , the coat very high-waisted with a flaring skirt and a narrow double-breasted effect , with four buttons very close together about the center of the chest . A handkerchief sticks out of his breast pocket . He carries a little " sample grip " and raincoat. p. 127 CLINTON DE WITT In gate . Hello , Julie , girl . JULIE DE WITT Runs up to him . Oh , darling ! I 've been counting the minutes for you to come . He embraces and kisses her . CLINTON DE WITT Coming in . Minutes ! Looks to me more as if you 'd been counting eggs . He indicates the table . JULIE DE WITT Takes his coat , puts it on back of chair . CLINTON puts sample grip on seat . Oh , of course , we 're doing our chores . The farmers ca n't stop working just because it 's Thanksgiving Day , can they ? CLINTON DE WITT Hello , Corinthia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . You 're looking well , too , Mr.De Witt . Putting eggs in the box . JULIE DE WITT She will do it . CLINTON DE WITT Do it ? Do what ? JULIE DE WITT Call you Mr. De Witt . CLINTON DE WITT To JULIE . I expected to get home last night but I stopped off at Poughkeepsie and I 'm glad I did . Made sixty-five dollars . p. 128 JULIE DE WITT Holding out her hand . Where is it ? CLINTON DE WITT Oh , I have n't got it yet . It will be in next month 's account  --  but here  --  Hands her small pay envelope . JULIE DE WITT Your pay ? CLINTON DE WITT Not even opened ! JULIE DE WITT Rises  --  turns him to her and sits on his knee as he sits on seat of post . Oh , you darling boy . You get a kiss for that . Kisses him . And this goes right into the bank . Slips it into her bosom . It 's really wonderful how rich we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy from us . JULIE DE WITT I wrote everyone I could think of and told them to always ask for the Queen Bee Brand . CORINTHIA So we 've started making little individuals . Takes a small hive of honey from table . Ai n't that cute ? JULIE goes up to her , takes the hive , and shows it to CLINTON . CLINTON DE WITT Great work . I only wish my customers were the sort who buy fancy things . p. 129 CORINTHIA But are n't they ? I ca n't imagine anything much fancier than these clothes you sell them . CLINTON DE WITT Rises . Say , what do you think of this suit , gals ? Turns round , exhibiting it . Wait a minute . Jumps on stool and poses . JULIE DE WITT Dubiously . Well  --  CLINTON DE WITT Oh , I know  --  The chaps at the Calumet Club would drop dead if they saw me in it ; but you should see the way it sells . Jumps down . CORINTHIA Is that your latest model ? CLINTON DE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was my idea . And maybe it does n't hit the small town sports right between the eyes ! Say , listen , this is on the level . I went to Mr. Fairbanks and made him a big offer if he 'd have his picture taken in one , but he could n't see it . JULIE DE WITT Could n't , why not ? CLINTON DE WITT Would have made him , would have made him ! Crossing to chicken-coop . Hello , what 's this ! JULIE DE WITT Oh , that 's a special chicken-coop for our prize Dorkings . We 've taken to exhibiting at the poultry shows , and we 're selling settings at splendid prices . p. 130 CLINTON DE WITT Who 's building it , Adam ? Jumps on coop  --  then sits on it . JULIE DE WITT Rises . Look out ! Keep your feet off . CLINTON DE WITT Oh , it 's all right , good and strong . JULIE DE WITT Yes ; he 's down in the cellar mixing some paint . CLINTON DE WITT Great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as crazy as ever about Eva ? JULIE screws up her face and shakes her head , motioning with it toward CORINTHIA , who has her back turned . What ? Whispering apologetically . Oh , yes  --  I forgot . CORINTHIA I think I 'd better be seeing about that new incubator . Goes off . JULIE DE WITT All right . I 'll look after dinner . To CLINTON . There , see what you did ! CLINTON DE WITT Does n't Adam know about Corinthia ? JULIE DE WITT No . He thinks she had a little crush on him for a week or two . He has n't eyes for anyone except Eva . CLINTON DE WITT And , of course , she and Andy are getting on all right ? p. 131 JULIE DE WITT Oh , yes . Only Eva is n't really mad about Andy . Smoothing down the crease of CLINTON 'S trouser leg . Not the way I am about you . Embraces and kisses her . If she were , she 'd be jealous of him . CLINTON DE WITT Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JULIE DE WITT No , no  --  only all the girls for miles round are taking riding lessons from him . CLINTON DE WITT Andy looks pretty fine on a horse . JULIE DE WITT So do you , darling . CLINTON again grabs her and loudly kisses her . CLINTON DE WITT Eva had better be careful . ADAM comes up the cellar steps , carrying two pails of paint and some brushes . ADAM SMITH Hello , Clinton ! CLINTON DE WITT Hello , Adam ! ADAM SMITH Why  --  you  --  why you 're perfectly magnificent ! JULIE stands on seat of post . CLINTON DE WITT Here , do n't start kidding me about my clothes . ADAM SMITH Say , do n't you think that 's pretty rough on me ? p. 132 CLINTON DE WITT Why ? ADAM SMITH I took you for a model and threw away my tie-clips and my belted coats  --  and now  --  look at the darn thing  --  Pulls corner of CLINTON 'S handkerchief . What about this thing ? Could I carry one like that ? CLINTON DE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like this if my customers see me dressed like an ordinary guy . ADAM SMITH With astounded surprise . Do you mean to say you sell those handkerchiefs ? CLINTON DE WITT Dozens of them . ADAM SMITH How darned clever of you . Crosses to chicken-coop . JULIE DE WITT Do n't tease him , Adam . Motions CLINTON to come to her . If you knew what a bitter pill it is to the poor dear to have to wear these clothes . CLINTON DE WITT Goes to JULIE and she puts her arm around his neck . It was at first , but I 'm getting used to them . In fact , I rather enjoy the sensation I create when I 'm sitting in the front window of the Grand Hotel or the Continental House . To ADAM . Do you know , they make special rates for me because they say I bring trade into the hotels ? p. 133 ADAM SMITH Sitting on coop , stirring the paint . The boys drop in to look you over ? Well , you 're a sport , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JULIE DE WITT Come on , Clinnie ; I 'm going to look after dinner . And you can husk the corn for us if you like . Picks up grip , gets his raincoat , and goes onto porch . CLINTON DE WITT You bet I will . Say , is n't this a wonderful day for Thanksgiving ? ADAM SMITH It 's as warm as if it were early September . CLINTON DE WITT By the way , Julie , I forgot to tell you Uncle Horace came out on the train with me . JULIE DE WITT On porch . I know . We invited him to come and have dinner . CLINTON DE WITT He stopped in the village to see a man who 's been dodging him . He feels pretty sure of catching him home on Thanksgiving Day . ADAM SMITH Is Uncle Horace still as aggressive in his business methods ? JULIE DE WITT He 's terrible . That 's why we do n't ask him out here very often . He does nothing but describe things that might happen to Clinton ; railroad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DE WITT I really think I 'd better let him insure my life and be done with it . JULIE DE WITT It 's no good . He 'd only start in on one of the rest of us . That man would insure the chickens if we 'd let him . Exit JULIE . CLINTON DE WITT Looking at ADAM , who is preparing to paint the roof of the chicken-coop . Gee , that 's the job I 'd like . JULIE DE WITT Calling from off-stage . Clinnie ! CLINTON DE WITT Crosses to door of house . Yes , coming , dearie . ADAM SMITH Mocking him . Coming , dearie . JULIE DE WITT Clinnie ! Adam laughs . CLINTON DE WITT Nix , Adam , nix ; I 'm just crazy about friend wife . Some rib , Adam  --  some rib . He exits into house . ADAM whistles his old favorite tune , " My Little Gray Home in the West . " Then , with red paint and using a small brush , he draws a heart on the roof of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the emblem a moment , his head on one side . EVA comes out of the house , carrying a glass bowl of cornmeal for the chickens , and eating a big red apple. p. 135 EVA KING Sees coop . Do n't tell me it 's all done ? ADAM SMITH Hastily turns his back to coop and paints it out , so she does not see it . Yes , I got up and finished it early this morning . I was the man with the hammer that you were cursing for waking you . EVA KING I did n't hear you ! ADAM SMITH No ! Well , of course I tried to hammer softly . Takes larger brush and commences to paint the roof of coop . EVA KING Nonsense . I 'll bet I was up before you . I took a little holiday and went riding with Andy . ADAM SMITH Trying to be airy about it . Must have been a perfect morning for horseback riding . EVA KING It was lovely . The air like crystal and that nice woody smell that comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really love this place , Adam . And our funny little gray house makes me understand what you used to mean when you talked with so much feeling about a home . ADAM SMITH Yes , it 'll be nice to look back at this time we 've all spent out here together . EVA KING Look back ? p. 136 ADAM SMITH Andy is doing pretty well now , is n't he ? EVA KING Running her fingers through the chicken feed . He 's getting on . ADAM SMITH Well , when is it going to be ? His attempt at carelessness is overdone . EVA KING When is what going to be ? Oh , the wedding , you mean ? ADAM SMITH Uh-huh ! Whistles and regards his painting through half-closed eyes . EVA KING Oh , not for a long time yet . ADAM SMITH Eyes on EVA  --  paints mechanically . But is n't he getting pretty anxious ? I know if I loved a girl I simply could n't wait for the day when  --  I could really call her mine . EVA KING @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you had found the woman you 'd always dreamed of ? Your hundred per cent girl , you called her . ADAM SMITH Did I say that ? EVA KING Yes . But maybe she turned out not to be a hundred per cent after all . ADAM SMITH No . She turned out even better than I expected  --  too good . p. 137 EVA KING Too good ? ADAM SMITH Too good for me . EVA KING Shaking her head . I do n't believe that . ADAM SMITH Yes , I think even you 'd have to admit it if you knew her as I know her  --  and saw just how splendid she is . EVA KING Piqued . She heedlessly spills the chicken feed as she runs her fingers through it . And does this female paragon realize that you think so highly of her ? ADAM SMITH Painting away . No , sir  --  I should say not . Oh , no . And what 's more , she never will . EVA KING Too bad . Have a bite of my apple , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from house . He is dressed in riding suit , with big reefer . He carries a sack of feed . LORD ANDREW GORDON Hello  --  ' ello  --  ' ello  --  ' ello . I say there  --  where shall I put this sack ? Stays on porch . EVA KING Hello , Andy , what is it ? LORD ANDREW GORDON A bag of feed for the jolly old poultry . Julie asked me to stop at the depot and pick it up . p. 138 ADAM SMITH Depot ? He 's coming on . We 'll make a real American of him yet . EVA KING Do you mind taking it down to the barn , Andy ? LORD ANDREW GORDON I should say not . EVA KING Thanks . LORD ANDREW GORDON But first of all I want a look at this work of art . Dumps sack down and inspects the chicken-coop . EVA KING It 's for the prize Dorkings . LORD ANDREW GORDON Jolly useful bit of work . You 're quite an architect , Adam . ADAM SMITH Glad you appreciate purity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to build a coop for Eva and me you can start right away . ADAM SMITH Why , Eva was telling me that you were n't going to begin housekeeping just yet . LORD ANDREW GORDON Yes , she 's always putting me off . Talks about " sometime . " Do n't you agree that it 's a bit rough on a fellow ? EVA KING Surely , we 're all very happy the way we are . LORD ANDREW GORDON But think how jolly it would be to have a home of our own . I 'm sure Adam understands the way I feel , eh , old chap ? p. 139 ADAM SMITH Yes , I understand . LORD ANDREW GORDON If you 'd only say next spring . EVA KING Oh , please , Andy , do n't be tiresome  --  LORD ANDREW GORDON Dash it all , are chickens the only thing you ever want to raise ? EVA KING Andy ! CORINTHIA enters . LORD ANDREW GORDON I know , but a chap ca n't help building a few air-castles . I 'm rather a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into his hand as he gestures . Oh , if that were only rice and they were chucking it at me . Throws some at her . CORINTHIA I wonder if you 'd mind seeing what you can do with that new incubator , Mr. Smith ? ADAM SMITH Sure I will . What 's the matter  --  the heat-regulator again ? CORINTHIA Yes . EVA KING I think I 'd better be on the safe side , and move my little chicks . It may turn cold to-night . LORD ANDREW GORDON Going up . Can I help ? EVA KING At gate . No , thanks ; I think Adam understands the nature of a chicken better than you do . Goes off. p. 140 LORD ANDREW GORDON Going down to coop . All right , I 'll paint . ADAM SMITH Hands him a paintbrush . Ever paint before ? Picking up bag of feed , swings it over his shoulder . LORD ANDREW GORDON I used to try and take a slap at our old castle in Scotland  --  but that was pretty hopeless . It has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the family in thirteen hundred and ten . Sits on box , gets ready to paint ; but never does . ADAM SMITH Thirteen hundred and ten ? Your family kind of got out of the habit of moving , did n't they ? Starts off after EVA . CORINTHIA Lord Andrew , could I have a word with you ? LORD ANDREW GORDON Surprised . Why , certainly , Corinthia  --  blaze away . CORINTHIA I 'm afraid you 'll think it 's pretty fresh of me , but I ca n't help it . I just hate to see him unhappy . LORD ANDREW GORDON Him ? CORINTHIA Adam . LORD ANDREW GORDON Adam unhappy ? Good Lord , what are you talking about ? Why , the dear old boy is chipper as a sand flea. p. 141 CORINTHIA Oh , of course he does n't let it show . For you 'd have to study him awful close to see it  --   --  LORD ANDREW GORDON To see what ? CORINTHIA That he 's crazy about Miss Eva . LORD ANDREW GORDON What ? CORINTHIA He 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's why I made up my mind to speak to you . LORD ANDREW GORDON Are you sure ? CORINTHIA Of course I 'm sure . Just as sure as I am that she 's in love with him . LORD ANDREW GORDON Eva 's in love with him ? CORINTHIA I would n't tell that to you , if I was n't pretty certain , would I ? LORD ANDREW GORDON You do n't seem the sort of girl to hurt a chap 's feelings  --  just for fun . CORINTHIA I 'm sorry to hurt you . LORD ANDREW GORDON Hold your horses a bit . You may be right about that fellow , Smith . Dash it all , anybody would be likely to fall in love with Eva . But the other thing , I 'm sure you 're wrong there . CORINTHIA You feel sure that she 's in love with you ? p. 142 LORD ANDREW GORDON Well , I do n't say it 's a great romantic pash . But dash it all , if she were n't fond of me , she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped the blessed title , you know . No , frankly , I do n't believe it . ADAM enters . CORINTHIA starts to make up cartons . ADAM SMITH It 's all right , Corinthia . Know what it was ? CORINTHIA No . ADAM SMITH Some grains of food in one of the pipes . Where 's my paintbrush , Andy ? LORD ANDREW GORDON Hands it to him . Here you are . ADAM SMITH Looking at coop . Oh , that looks much better . Are n't you going to go and help Eva feed the chickens ? LORD ANDREW GORDON Think she wants me to ? ADAM SMITH Surprised . Why , of course she does . LORD ANDREW GORDON You were wrong about that , Corinthia . Exits . ADAM SMITH Painting the posts of the coop . What were you wrong about , Corinthia ? CORINTHIA Nothing  --  just something I was trying to make him see . Gee , but the Scotch are pretty thick , are n't they ? KING starts to enter. p. 143 ADAM SMITH I do n't know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 're a great race , Corinthia  --  and Andy Gordon is one of the best . CORINTHIA I suppose you 're right . Starts for porch with an armful of cartons she has been shaping . JAMES KING Coming through gate . Hello , Smith . CORINTHIA On porch . Why , it 's Mr. King ! JAMES KING Laying coat on charir . How are you , Corinthia ? ADAM SMITH Rising . Well , this is a surprise . JAMES KING Going to him . It 's nothing to the surprise I got when I heard you were all living out here . Let me sit down . Sits on seat of post . I 'm tired . I could n't find a jitney at the station , so I walked . That short cut is n't as short as it used to be when I was a kid . CORINTHIA Wait till Julie hears this . Exits into house . JAMES KING Julie ? What did she say ? ADAM SMITH You 're looking well . p. 144 JAMES KING Oh , yes , I 'm well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my family doing out here in this God-forsaken spot ? ADAM SMITH Raising chickens . JAMES KING Raising what ? ADAM SMITH Chickens . Oh , they love it here  --  the peace and quiet are wonderful . JAMES KING Rises . Peace and quiet  --  do n't you ever say those words to me again . ADAM SMITH Why , what 's the matter ? JAMES KING I 've had enough peace and quiet to last me a lifetime . I want my family . ADAM SMITH I told you so . JAMES KING Oh , shut up . I 'm trying to grasp this thing . I came back expecting to find my whole family on Long Island raising hell and I find them in New Jersey raising chickens . ADAM SMITH You 'll see your whole family to-day . They 're all coming out here for Thanksgiving . JAMES KING Rises . Thanksgiving . Just what I hurried here for . Tell me , both my girls are all right ? ADAM SMITH Absolutely . p. 145 JAMES KING How 's my sister-in-law ? ADAM SMITH Miss Rooker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you do n't mean it ? ADAM SMITH Yes , Miss Rooker is married . JAMES KING Married ? ADAM SMITH About a fortnight ago . I think the gentleman 's name is Bradley . He is very rich and has the gout ; is n't expected to live long  --  great marriage . JAMES KING Well , I 'm damned ; a ten-year tenant gone . ADAM SMITH If you 'll stay here I 'll go and tell the family that you 've arrived . UNCLE HORACE enters from house . He looks younger , sturdier , and very businesslike . He carries a brief-case . He meets ADAM on the porch . HORACE PIGRIM Hello , Smith ! How are you this bright , beautiful day ? Starts to shake hands . ADAM holds up his hand , all covered with paint . UNCLE HORACE shakes him by the wrist . ADAM SMITH I 'm well , thank you . HORACE PIGRIM You , you 're well now ; but you never can tell . All days are not bright and beautiful . Think of the rainy ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , the wise man makes provision for the rainy day and we have a policy  --   --  p. 146 ADAM SMITH Hold on , hold on , look who 's here ? HORACE PIGRIM Why , great guns , I had n't any idea ! Sees KING , who comes to meet him . It 's poor James . Shakes hands . JAMES KING Poor James ? HORACE PIGRIM You know you have my sympathy , do n't you ? Now if you had thought of the rainy day  --   --  ADAM SMITH Please , Mr. Pigrim . HORACE PIGRIM Yes , yes , of course . I wo n't remind him of happier times . JAMES KING Happier times  --  what the  --   --  ADAM SMITH That 's right . You entertain Mr. King a few minutes while I go round and collect the family . I 'll begin with Eva . She 's down at the barn . Exit ADAM . HORACE PIGRIM Do you know , James , you 're looking pretty yellow . JAMES KING I 'm sunburned . HORACE PIGRIM It 's not a healthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  make me think I 'm ill again ? You ca n't pull that over on me a second time . Sits on stool. p. 147 HORACE PIGRIM Following him up  --  takes a large manila envelope from his hip pocket . I do n't say you 're ill , but you never can tell what may happen to you . At your leisure , look over this pamphlet . Hands him insurance leaflet . JAMES KING Taking it mechanically and reading title . " Too Late ! A Lament From the Beyond . " HORACE PIGRIM And here is another that I have found very helpful . " The Night Cometh When No Man Can Work . " Starts to hand it to him but draws it back and carefully underlines a section ; then hands it to KING . Now tell me , James , have you ever found out whether or not you are a firstclass risk ? JAMES KING Good Lord , you people were bad enough when I went away ; but at least you had n't begun to take an interest in my life insurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careless butterflies with no thought of the future ; but we 're different now . I said to the family the last time I was out here , " the first thing I mean to do when James returns is to see that he takes out as much insurance as the poor chap can afford . " JAMES KING Rises . Well , I 'm damned ! This is a nice reception for a man . p. 148 HORACE PIGRIM Taking a leather folder from breast pocket . Now  --   --  Selecting a policy . Now , I have here a twenty-year endowment policy that is specially constructed for men of your age . Hands it to KING . JAMES KING Do n't tell me that you 're a life insurance agent ? HORACE PIGRIM What the deuce did you think I was  --  an elephant trainer ? You evidently have n't been paying any attention to what I 've been saying . JAMES KING Puts policy in pocket . I thought your interest in the matter was solely that of a beneficiary . So , you 're actually working ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KING My God , you 're working ! JULIE bursts out of the house . She wears an apron . JULIE DE WITT Runs to him  --  throws her arms about his neck . Oh , Dad , you dear old Daddy ! Kisses him . Be careful of your clothing . I 'm all over flour . JAMES KING Flour ! You 're all over flour ? Say , somebody , roll me over , I always dream when I 'm on my back . p. 149 CLINTON DE WITT Enters from house , hastily . KING crosses toward him and shakes hands . Hello , Pater , old scout , how 's the boy ? We 're tickled to death to see you again . KING stares at the apparition of his son-in-law . JULIE DE WITT Sits on stool . What do you think of him ? JAMES KING On porch . Say , is n't he a little old to be dressing up and begging pennies on Thanks-giving ? CLINTON DE WITT On porch . Ah , this is my regular suit . JAMES KING What ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us ? JAMES KING Well , from the way you tried to get rid of me , I thought you would n't want to hear from me . CLINTON DE WITT Oh , I say , Pater , old sport . JAMES KING But why did n't you write me you 'd moved out here ? JULIE DE WITT Adam asked us not to mention anything about what we were doing . CLINTON DE WITT But it 's all right now , Pater . JULIE DE WITT We 've got a real home for you here  --  a real home . p. 150 CLINTON DE WITT Yes , for you , Pater . HORACE PIGRIM The kind that Adam used to talk about . JAMES KING Say , what is it ? Why do n't you tell me , what 's happened ? EVA enters . EVA KING Oh , Father  --   --  She runs to him , throws arms about him . JAMES KING Eva , my little girl . Kisses her , then holds her off and looks at her . Why , you 're looking splendid . Farm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it does . You 're a little thinner and wonderfully brown . HORACE PIGRIM Rises . Yes , now 's the time for him to get a good rate  --  before the tan wears off . JULIE goes up to settee , disgusted . The doctors judge a lot by the way a man looks . CLINTON DE WITT Ca n't you forget business for a few minutes ? JULIE DE WITT I should say so . You do n't see Clinton trying to sell father any clothes . HORACE PIGRIM He 'd have a fine chance of selling him those things he wears . JAMES KING Do n't tell me you 've gone into business , too , Clinton ? p. 151 CLINTON DE WITT Certainly , Pater . We all have . JAMES KING All ? He looks at EVA . EVA KING Daddy , you wo n't recognize your old farm . We 've got three hundred chickens . JULIE DE WITT And four million bees . Clinton and I counted up the other night . There are eighty thousand bees in a swarm . JAMES KING But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had to , dear . JAMES KING Had to ? CLINTON DE WITT Swaggering a bit . Well , of course , we could have sat down and cabled for you to come back and work for us ; but that never even suggested itself to us . HORACE PIGRIM Stoutly . I should say not . EVA KING Wait till you hear what we 've all done . You 'll be proud of us . Why , these past two months we 've actually saved three times as much as we spent . ALL Ah , ha ! KING looks from EVA to JULIE , dumfounded . JAMES KING Sits . Poor old Rip Van Winkle ; I know just how he felt . p. 152 JULIE DE WITT To KING . So you see if you need any help , Dad , we 've got some money to give you for a change . JAMES KING Good Heavens ; you 're all talking as if I 'd gone broke . JULIE DE WITT Well , so you have , dear . EVA KING That 's the reason that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Say , is this whole thing a joke ? CLINTON DE WITT To UNCLE HORACE . Poor old Pater . He does n't realize what has happened to him . HORACE PIGRIM Taps forehead . Of course . Tropical heat . JULIE DE WITT Father , dear , have you forgotten what happened ten days after you left us ? EVA KING The Brazilian embargo on rubber shipments ? JULIE DE WITT And the way the rubber shares jumped up ? CLINTON DE WITT You had sold short and , of course , you had to cover . HORACE PIGRIM Even though it took your last dollar . JAMES KING My last dollar ? Nonsense . I only lost about seventy thousand in that little rubber panic . p. 153 JULIE DE WITT  --  Surprised . Seventy thousand ? CLINTON DE WITT Whispers hoarsely to UNCLE HORACE . I dare say that 's what Adam let him think . JAMES KING You mean that something has happened to the business that I have n't been told about ? EVA KING Adam almost cried when he broke the news to us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you and of how you had always worked for us . JAMES KING I see what has happened . They made a mess of things down at the office . Adam and that fellow , Russell . I was a fool to go away and trust a tricky business like mine to a couple of underlings . EVA KING But Adam said the trouble was all because of that embargo of the Brazilian Government . JAMES KING Yes , he told you that because he was afraid to admit that he had lost my money . EVA KING You mean that you think Adam deliberately lied ? JAMES KING What else am I to think ? Why has he kept me in the dark as to all of this ? I bet he even told you not to mention what had happened , in the letters you wrote me. p. 154 JULIE DE WITT Yes , he said we must n't worry you . JAMES KING There , you see . HORACE PIGRIM Ah , James , why did n't you leave your affairs in the hands of a real business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? HORACE PIGRIM Yes . LORD ANDREW enters . LORD ANDREW GORDON Shakes hands . Hello  --  ' ello  --  ' ello  --  ' ello  --  ' ello  --  ' ello . I say , I am glad to see you . JAMES KING Hello , Lord Andrew . I never expected to find you still here . LORD ANDREW GORDON Not Lord , just plain Andrew . Andrew Gordon of Gordon 's Livery Stable . Hands him his business card . EVA KING Andy , where 's Adam ? LORD ANDREW GORDON Adam ? Oh , he just borrowed my hack and drove off with it toward the station . HORACE PIGRIM Drove off with it ? LORD ANDREW GORDON Going to buy something , I think he said . JULIE DE WITT Buy something ? Why , it 's Thanks-giving. p. 155 LORD ANDREW GORDON So it is . The shops are all closed . CLINTON , suspicious , crosses to JULIE . HORACE PIGRIM And there 's a train to New York at a quarter to one . EVA KING Oh , but Father , this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't done anything wrong . JAMES KING I do n't say he has done anything wrong , but he has made a mess of things and he has been trying to cover up his tracks . LORD ANDREW GORDON Tracks ? Good Lord , I wonder  --   --  HORACE PIGRIM What 's the matter with you ? LORD ANDREW GORDON It 's your saying that about tracks made me think of it . You will remember how , when we found the jewels were stolen , I went to look for tracks . JAMES KING Jewels stolen ? What 's this ? EVA KING Oh , it does n't matter about the jewels . CLINTON DE WITT Pearl necklace or two  --  a mere bagatelle . LORD ANDREW GORDON I never told you before , but I found something on the floor of your room , Julie , right near the safe  --  one of those dashed things some chappies wear around their arms to keep their sleeves up . p. 156 CLINTON DE WITT A sleeve garter . LORD ANDREW GORDON Yes , and I know it was n't yours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ANDREW GORDON So I showed it to Adam . JAMES KING Well ? LORD ANDREW GORDON Well , he blushed . JULIE DE WITT Blushed ? LORD ANDREW GORDON Yes , and he laughed in a shamefaced sort of way and told me it was his . HORACE PIGRIM Why in the deuce did n't you tell any of us ? LORD ANDREW GORDON I do n't know , but the idea of suspecting Adam of taking those jewels seemed too utterly idiotic . In fact , I do n't believe it even now . EVA KING Well , it 's true , he did take them . ALL What ? JAMES KING What ? JULIE DE WITT What are you talking about ? EVA KING But , that is n't any reason why you should n't trust him . JAMES KING Eh , what 's that ? EVA KING I should believe in Adam even if I did n't know he had such a splendid motive for stealing our pearls . p. 157 HORACE PIGRIM Great Scott , she 's crazy now . EVA KING Do n't you see why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KING I do n't understand about the failure or whose fault it was that Dad 's business was smashed , but after it had happened , Adam knew that we would never go to work if we had those pearls to sell , so he stole them . JAMES KING And you knew about it ? EVA KING Yes , I knew . JULIE DE WITT How did you manage to keep a secret like that ? EVA KING And do you realize Adam took all that trouble just for us ? Look at us , what were we when father went away ? A lot of worthless , idle wasters . And look at us now ! He has given us self-respect . He has shown us there is more fun in working and earning money than there is in spending it . He 's fine and no matter how things look-whatever you may say , nothing can shake my faith in him . LORD ANDREW GORDON Noting her defense of ADAM . By Jove , Corinthia was right . HORACE PIGRIM That 's all very well , but if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he run away ? ADAM enters gate , carrying a pail of green paint and brush. p. 158 ADAM SMITH Well , how is the family reunion getting along ? EVA KING Oh , Adam , I knew you could n't have run away . ADAM SMITH Run away ? CLINTON DE WITT So you did n't take that train ? ADAM SMITH Train ? HORACE PIGRIM Some of them thought you had gone to New York . ADAM SMITH You do n't have to go to New York to get green paint , do you ? Oh , I see , you thought now that since your real father had come back , it was time for me to abdicate . What do you think of my chicken-coop , Mr. King ? Starts painting . JAMES KING Smith , my family have just been telling me that the King Company has gone to the devil . ADAM SMITH Oh , yes ; bad business , is n't it ? JAMES KING Very bad . ADAM SMITH But on the other hand , the bee and chicken industry are thriving . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen ? You must have been gambling with futures . ADAM SMITH Yes , sir , I was . HORACE PIGRIM Oh , perhaps I had better take down his confession in shorthand . p. 159 ADAM SMITH Only it was n't rubber futures I was gambling with , but human futures ; the futures of all these people here . JAMES KING Yes , if you have ruined me , you have ruined them . ADAM SMITH Ruined them ? Good heavens , look at them , are they ruined ? Look at Uncle Horace  --  why , he has even learned shorthand . Is n't it marvelous  --  and look at  --  My daughters  --  your daughters  --  our daughters  --  are n't you proud of them ? As a business man and a captain of industry , you 're a marvel ; but , as a father , you 're simply not in it with me . JAMES KING Realizing the truth . Do you mean to say  --   --  ADAM SMITH Yes , the story of the ruin was a fake . You are still rich and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ALL Resent it . Oh ! ADAM SMITH If they will let you ; but I miss my guess if they do . CLINTON DE WITT To think this man faked up the whole story of the ruin just to make us work . Good God ! ADAM SMITH That 's it . JULIE DE WITT Was n't that a cute idea ? p. 160 JAMES KING I can see why you did it , but I 'm darned if I can see how you did it . ADAM SMITH Well , I had to take the office into my confidence . JAMES KING Yes , but how  --   --  CORINTHIA Dinner 's ready . I 've just put it on the table . JAMES KING It 'll have to wait then . I 've got to discuss this business with Adam . JULIE DE WITT But , Father , we must n't let dinner spoil . I 've made a cake  --  my first  --  and just think , it may be my last . CLINTON DE WITT There , there , darling , she shall make all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich . JULIE DE WITT And will you eat them ? CLINTON DE WITT Well , wait till I 've tried this one , darling . CORINTHIA Which one is going to carve the turkey , Mr. Smith or Mr. King ? ADAM SMITH Oh , Mr. King  --  And let me warn you , you 'll have to work quick , they 've got great appetites . CORINTHIA exits . CLINTON DE WITT I should say we have . Supposing we let Adam tell his story at the table . p. 161 HORACE PIGRIM Yes , he can talk while we eat . CLINTON DE WITT Good idea . Come , Pater , we must n't let that turkey spoil . Takes KING 'S arm . JULIE DE WITT Takes his other arm . I should say not ; it took ten dollars ' worth of chicken feed to fatten him . JAMES KING How many chickens did you say you have , Julie  --  four million ? CLINTON DE WITT No , no , Pater , those were the bees . JAMES KING I 'm dazed , absolutely dazed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do you realize that we 've got a perfect right to be damn sore at you ? ADAM SMITH Working on coop . I suppose you have . HORACE PIGRIM That does n't help the fact that I 've been spending three months at night school studying shorthand and answering to the nickname Methusalah ! ADAM SMITH Come on , admit that you enjoyed it . HORACE PIGRIM I 'll admit nothing of the sort . But I tell you there 's just one way you can square yourself with me. p. 162 ADAM SMITH Yes ? HORACE PIGRIM Smiling . Let me insure your life . ADAM SMITH Laughing . All right  --  though I do n't see the use . I 'm not married and I never could be . HORACE PIGRIM Knock wood ; knock wood . ADAM SMITH Turns to " knock wood "  --  the seat of post ; sees EVA standing by post . Does n't knock wood , but turns to UNCLE HORACE . And I have n't a relation in the world . HORACE PIGRIM Oh , yes , you have ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll make the policy out in favor of the King family . LORD ANDREW GORDON That 's pretty good . HORACE PIGRIM And I 'll tell you another thing . I 'm going to insure James myself so that we 'll all be protected in case he really does go broke . Exits . EVA KING Crosses to porch . Come on in , Adam , we 'll have a father at either end of the table . LORD ANDREW GORDON Rises . Eva , can I have just a word with you ? ADAM starts work on coop . Why did n't you tell a fellow ? p. 163 EVA KING On porch . Tell you what ? LORD ANDREW GORDON That you are in love with Adam . ADAM SMITH What ? LORD ANDREW GORDON Yes , and that you 're in love with her . EVA KING Who told you ? LORD ANDREW GORDON Ah , I 've just been watching you both an ' I 've noticed a few things . EVA KING You noticed ? Oh , no , Andy , you dear old silly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not any more than Adam could . ADAM SMITH Eh ? How 's that ? LORD ANDREW GORDON It  --  it 's true though , is n't it ? EVA nods her head . Then that 's settled . It 's been deuced well worth while knowin ' you and bein ' one of the family . EVA KING You 'll always be that , Andy , dear . LORD ANDREW GORDON Congrats , Adam , old boy , an '  --  an ' all that sort of thing . Starts into house , turns again in doorway . I say , that turkey smells devilish good . Goes in whistling , with an attempt at jauntiness. p. 164 EVA KING Pauses  --  looking after him . Is n't he a dear ? ADAM SMITH Eva  --   --  He breaks off . She looks up at him . EVA KING Yes  --  Adam ? ADAM SMITH Crosses to her . I do n't know what to say . It  --  it does n't seem possible . EVA KING Rises  --  and crosses to him . Maybe you do n't love me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , Eva ; there are n't any words to tell you . He now finds the courage to hold her in his arms and is about to kiss her . EVA KING Father ! ADAM SMITH Thinking she means MR . KING  --  jumps back . Where ? EVA KING No , dear  --  not Daddy . Taking his hands and helping him out . It 's you that I 'm calling that  --   --  ADAM SMITH Oh , Gee , I forgot . EVA KING Then I 'll tell you something . I think maybe  --  after we 're married  --  we 'll be like good old-fashioned country folk ; and I 'll always call you  --  " Father . " She says it slowly , he holds her closer and kisses her. p. 165 HORACE PIGRIM At the window with a turkey bone in his hand . Say , if you do n't hurry , there 'll be nothing left for you but the neck  --  I say , the neck . Sees the situation . Oh-h . He closes the window  --  leaving ADAM and EVA in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
