txt In application of the principles thus far discussed it would appear that agreement between Great Britain and Germany in regard to establishing " the right of all nations , great and small , to free development " probably depends upoa the granting of autonomy to Ireland , to Poland , and to the South Slavonic peoples , as well as upon the general adoption of the opendoor policy in foreign trade . Belgium must , of course , be restored and indemnified by Germany . In like manner Serbia must be restored and indemnified by Austria-Hungary . Underlying and supporting all of these acts would be a new international guarantee for the national security of all peoples , great and small alike . If the mind of Great Britain and the mind of Germany could meet on these points ? and why should they not ? ? there is no reason to suppose that either France or Russia would hold back , unless perhaps it might be in regard to the more complete application of the open-door policy in foreign trade . But France , who seeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the protection of the principles of public conduct in which she ardently believes , would almost certainly assent to a plan that would ask her to sacrifice so little in the way of a modified economic policy in order to attain so much of permanent good for herself and for the world . The situation as regards Russia appears to be quite similar , particularly if Russia can be assured of that free access to the sea throughout the year which she has so long desired , and which she should have in the general interest as well as In her own . There would then remain the one important question referred to by Chancellor von Bethmann Hollweg in his speech of Nov. 9 last , and not mentioned by Viscount Grey in his speech of Oct. 23 , namely , the conditions on the seas . That Germany is deeply concerned on this point has long been apparent . The freedom of the seas is one of the five points covered by the peace program of the Bund Neues Vaterland . It is made one of the peace aims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his six proposals for peace made public on April 18 , 1915 . The Imperial German Chancellor evidently lays great stress upon it . One must inquire , therefore , just what is meant by the freedom of the seas and in what respect that freedom is now lacking or denied . Under existing international law the seas are , and long have been , free outside of the conventional three-mile limit . There are no longer any pirates , and no charge is made for traversing the seas between one port and another . There are no rights of way over the ocean . In law , therefore , the seas would seem to be even freer than the land . Small peoples with insignificant navies , such as the Norwegians , the Danes , the Dutch , and the Portuguese , have been and a , re successful sea-traders to no inconsiderable extent . Germany herself has , within the past forty Years , built up a stupendous merchant marine , and at the outbreak of the present war her flag was as familiar as any other in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the desired freedom of the seas has nothing to do with the normal conditions of international peace : it must relate entirely to the abnormal conditions of international war . So far , therefore , as future international wars can be guarded against and averted by an agreement upon such policies as have already been described , all differences as to freedom of the seas will disappear . If , however , the world is to contemplate another international war like that now raging , what is the ground for that German uneasiness as to the freedom of the seas which is so apparent ? It is , however , not yet entirely clear just what specific things Germany aims at in pressing for freedom of the seas . The freedom of the seas to which the United States , for example , owes its existence and Its prosperity , and for which both Holland and Great Britain stoutly contended in days gone by , is the freedom which Grotius defined when he laid it down as a specific and unimpeachable axiom of the law of nations . the spirit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation is free to travel to every other nation . and to trade with it . " It is in this broad and fundamental sense that the world already possesses freedom of the seas . Those municipal regulations which so often restrict and harass international trade have no application on the sea itself . but only at the ports of entry . Doubtless , however , the mind of Germany , like the mind of Great Britain , has come very largely under the dominance of the argument of that American book which has , on the whole , had more influence in shaping modern European policy than any other work published on this side of the Atlantic . That book is the late Admiral Mahan 's " Influence of Sea Power upon History . " This illuminating book has , however . nothing whatever to do ? with the freedom of the seas . It deals wholly with questions relating to the control of the seas , a quite different matter . Two of Admiral llolahan 's ruling contentions are that commerce needs navies for its protection and that sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and often a decisive factor . It is plain/ that in time of war , and as one of the incidents of war , the control of the seas will rest with the most powerful and best distributed navy . At such a time the seas can not possibly be free to ships of war , which must take their chances in battle with an antagonist . What Germany doubtless has in mind is the fact that the British , Navy is not only powerful enough to control the seas in time of war , but that this control may be , and in the German view is , so used as to deprive Germany and her allies of some advantages through trade with neutrals to which they are legally entitled . This narrows the question down to neutral trade In time of war and to the exemption of private property ftom capture at sea . On this topic there has been much discussion in recent years , and the policies to which the United States is committed have been stated over and over again . What , if any , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have Germany and the neutral nations because of the way in which Great Britain has exercised its power of sea control in time of war , and how far must these grievances ? be taken into account in laying the foundations for a just and stable peace ?
