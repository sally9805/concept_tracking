txt No units of the American Arniy , ? . NatiOnal Giiard , or other military forces Willbe meta to the battle front in Europe for use in the War ' against the German Government , according to Present plans of the Administration . until a total of approximately 1,000,000 men have been placed in train , ing . The war plan , ab it now stands , follows : First  --  To utilize the navy in every possible way ; n joint operations with the British and Frencn navies . against the German sea forces and their marine operations . ? Second  --  To munition the Entente Allies to the fullest possible extent with out interference with the manufacture of American munitions . - . Third  --  To make an immediate loan of $3,000,000,000 to the Allies . , Fourth  --  To do everything possible toward providing England with foodstuffs to offset the operations of the German U-boat campaign . Pifth  --  To train a million men the first year . and another million men the next year , none of whom are to be sent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready and plans are completed for keeping this force supplied in the field . Sixth  --  To utilize this force of a million men , if necessary , to turn the tide against the Germans in the great war . ? High officials of the War Department and members of the General Start of the army are strongly opposed . to the dispatch or any American land forces to Europe at this time , either under command of Colonel Roosevelt , , formed In a separate division , of volunteers , ' or ? as a unit from the National Guard or Regular Army . Would Waste Valuable . Material . Much has been said in some quarters In favor of sending a force of . 10,000 20,000 to Europe as rapidly as possible for the psychological effect that this display of the American flag would have at the front . High army officials insisted today that nothing would be gained and everything lost by such action . A force of 10,000 men , It is argued , would be only a drop in the bucket along tile battle front . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officer of the army that for every man sent now from the regular army to the fighting front in Europe the United States would be out 100 soldiers within two years . The plans of the army now contemplate the use of ... virtually all the real . fighting men service in training the new . force of ? million men to be raised auo ' Into condition within a year . It le considered more . important at , , this stage of the war to keep ' American officers , Sergeants , drill masters , and privates at home for use in training . the new armies to be raised than to send them off in small expeditions to be frittered away , without effective results along the battle front . The same arguments that the army authorities are using against sending any expeditionary unit . a their ? own to the front at this time are being axlVanced by them in support of their opposition to any plan , for ' sending a division of volunteers there at this . time under Colonel Roosevelt . If Colonel Roosevelt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force , , it is being insisted upon in army circles , his force should not go until the rest of the army is ready to go . and when a land force that would really have some effect in turning the scale of battle ? has  --  been fully trained titthis country , ? If ' trained farces ; were sent to Europe In would not be of value , and would put an unnecessary burden of training on British and French forces . If a trained force of 25,000 men were sent , it is argued . it would take from this country at a time when they are-neecten most regular army- soldiers needed for training the force of 2,000,000 men to be.raised here in the next two years . . Based on England 's Lesson . The argument advanced by ' regular army officers against the adoption of such a policy is declared by them to be based on one of the most important lessons of the war  --  that which England sorely learned at Mons. In the early days of the war England , yielding to French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Continent for use in the drive at Mons , and many of them were lost there . Small units which were then sent from England to France , it is now recognized , would have been of greater- value if retained in England for use in training the new army which England has since put into the field . In this connection army officers today pointed to an article which has appeared in The London Times , . deprecating the idea favored by those who would like to see the United States send small units to the front in the beginning , and.pointing out that this would be the greatest detriment to the American army plans , just as the sending of small British units to the front proved detrimental to the construction of a new British Army . " We have the most complete reports on the results obtained durding nearly two years of fighting in Europe . " said an army official today . " These reports are especially complete regarding , the best methods of intensified training , used in raisinug forces for the war in belligerent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The War College has just completed the use of this material in making new training manuals , which will be ready to be issued as soon as we begin the training of the new force of 1,000,000 American regulars , guardsmen , and those to be ' drafted . These manuals will be thoroughly up to date . They will embrace all the successful principles used in the present war , and these manuals will be furnished by the War College in tire for use in training . They will also embody everything learned regarding trench warfare in Europe as . a highly specialized feature of modern warfare . " Army building plans of the Administration are to be supplemented - at once by the establishment at many points throughout the - country , of civilian training camps.for officers . The great need of the war army to be raised will be properly equipped officers , and to aid in meeting the demand the War Department has decided to adopt the Plattsburg idea on a nation-wide scale . Arrangements for the camps already are being made , and civilians desirous of fitting themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to departmental commanders for assignments to them . The number of camps to be set up will depend on the number of applications received . A course of three months ' vigorous training will be given to the prospective officers , who will be organized into companies or larger units and go through all the drills and exercises of enlisted men , supplemented by lecture courses as to the duties of officers . The qualities displayed by men ; undergoing this training will determine whether they are suited to army life , and also the rank in the Reserve Corps which they are qualified to hold . Commissions will be issued at the conclusion of the training period to those accepted , who will be assigned to units of the regulhr army , National Guard , or the first contingent of troops to he raised under the draft plan . The scheme is designed particularly to meet the situation of civilians who have had no military experience , and who are too old to enter the Second Lieutenant grade of the Reserve Corps , but are otherwise qualified by education and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The department , it was announced today , has suspended the regulation limiting new enlistments kri the regular army to men not moz4 than 35 years of age . This was made possible by , the war declaration against Germany . Under existing law men not more than 43 years of age could be accepted , but to conform to the Administration 's Army bill , the maximum age has now been set at 40 years . The present authorized strength of the regulars will soon be reached at the present rate of enlistment . Including all combatant and non-combatant troops and unassigned recruits , this would mean a total of 138,000 enlisted men . Until the President so directs , the regiments can not be brought up to war strength or additional regiments be organized . it is apparent that the Administration is not inclined to take this step until Congress nas acted on the new Army bill . An exception will be made in the case of regiments of negro troops , however ; some of which already are over the authorized peace strength . They will he filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other regiments will also be prosecuted vigorously , it is indicated , as the prozess of assembling , equipping , and assigning rec  --  uits takes some time and it is expected Congress will have acted before any considerable number in excess tor authorized strength will be ready to join their regiments
