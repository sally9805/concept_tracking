I SPENT seven years in academic and professional studies under excellent teachers . I have spent seven years in agricultural pursuits under the hard knocks of the farm . Which has constituted the better part of my education ? My wife , whose academic education was of a high order , often raises this question for herself as well as for inc . Of this we are assured ? to have lived on a farm under the conditions that we have experienced and with the motives that have actuated us during these seven years , has called out a deVelopment of manhood and womanhood as amazing as it was unexpected . After my seven years ' professional training I was for twenty-five years the minister of a church in a rather large centre of population on the Mississippi River . During this time I taught classes , participated in clubs , and promoted and attended lectures , all these activities going far toward continuing for me the spirit and habits of the university . I also enjoyed rather wide social opportunities and was associated with business and professional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , beside the mark to say that I had enjoyed a fair share of the best that books and the best that the associations of a city can yield ? When a man thus trained and habituated broke completely with his past and became a farmer , working ten to fourteen GOO hours a day with the workmen on a farm , what would you imagine happened ? One of the first things to happen of which I was vividly conscious , was that I was acquiring or regaining hardihood . If you ask me , then , what the farm can do for a man , I will reply that it can give him hardness , or hardiness , or hardihood . During all the period I was in the city there was not a year when I did not row , play golf and tennis , climb mountains , keep up vigorous walking . I pursued these exercises both as a delight and as a necessity ; and yet when I became a farmer , their worth , as a means of physical invigoration , struck me as laughable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present social conditions . But the man who is at work ten to twelve hours a day on the farm , taking the weather as it comes ; put tine under strain more muscles than Dr. Sargent with his gymnastic equipments ever called into play ; forcing himself to en . dure unceasingly the nasty and disagreeable ; running the risk of physical injury at every turn ( an accident polity costs a farmer three times as much as it does a minister ; three several times during these seven years I escaped death by the narrowest margin ) ; and stand-Mg ever ready to offer up his body , if not as a sacrifice , then as the unshrinking servant of whatsoever demand exigent crops and still more exigent stock can lay upon him , ? such a man , I say , feels a quality of physical valor growing up within him that puts to shame what he knew of himself in the city . So at least I found it . Over and above the hardiness which the farm engenders , and of a far higher quality , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Courage is the elemental virtue , for life has been and will forever be a tight . A farmer 's life is one incessant fight . Think what he dares ! He dares to try to control the face of this planet . In order to raise his crops he pits himself against the weather and seasons ; he forces t he soil to his wishes ; he wars against the plant world , the animal world , the insect world , the bacterial world . Is not that a fight , looked at philosophically , to make one stand aghast ? After I had been on the farm seven years , the tremendousness of the fight that my fellow farmers were waging discloed it self to me with a force no figure orspeech can convey . Until one can lie brought to some realization of this aspect of the farmer 's life , he has no adequate grounds for comprehending 1110 discipline and development which in the very nature of the case that life must receive . I often contrast the lot of the clerk at his books , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his desk , with risk the fattier runs . That the former will be paid for their work is almost certain ; it is extremely uncertain whether the farmer will be paid for his . He must dare to lose at every turn ; scarcely a week passes in which he does not lose , ( trinitinies heavily , sometimes considerably . Those moments in a battle when it seems as if every plan had gone to smash , which so test the fortitude of a general , are moments which a farmer experiences more frequently and more strenuously than men in most occupations . If he sticks to his task successfully his capacity for courage must grow to meet the demands ; if he will not stick , he is sifted out by force of circumstance , leaving the stronger type of man to hold the farms . Initiative ? surely one of the secrets of leadership ? may be selected next , to illustrate the virtues which are called into play by the multitude of difficulties under which the farmer labors . It is amazing how incessantly he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I felt the conviction deepening in me that no matter what blind wall we ran up against , a door through it must and could be found . I fear that a great majority of people , at least in a great majority of cases , simply sit clown when they run up against a blind wall . If they can call the plumber , or the butcher , or the gardener , or the laundress , or the shoemaker , or the blacksmith , or the dairyman , or the horse-tamer ? then a way out will be made for them . And that is what your city life tends to do for your boys and girls ? set them to calling upon an endless variety of specialists to help them surmount life 's problems . On the other hand , farmer boys and girls must learn to be all these specialists . The consequence is , they grow up with the feeling that they can and must do it , no matter what befalls ; and that feeling , or I greatly miss my count , is the secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the farm lad going up to the city carries with him , he retains as a man ; and hence to these country-bred falls by an inherent law of nature the leadership of nations . Surely such leadership exists or it would not be found that eighty-seven per cent of the men and women listed in Who 's Who in America were country-bred . But it is to be noted that a goodly percentage of farmers and farm-hands can not meet the strain involved in this 602 FROM THE STUDY TO THE FARM demand for initiative . It requires a readiness in original thinking and in resoluteness of spirit to which they are not equal . I have come to the conclusion , after careful reflection , that no one thing does more to drive men away from the farm into the city than these requirements . I noticed that as long as our work was mere routine which went along without a hitch , even though physically it was trying , all went well . But when machinery broke down , the stock played the unexpected , the weather and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had to wrestle and worry , think and hold on hard ; then you had to watch or the men would be off , ' or if not ' offi ' then ' at outs ' with you . The call for initiative overtaxed their natural powers , and in a moment of disgust they would resolve to leave for the city , where they believed they would not have to ' stick it out ' under so much that is difficult , vexing , exhausting , and baffling . And in this belief they were certainly right . For shop work , in this respect , is far easier than farm work . The six movements regarded by the Ford Automobile Company as the maximum to secure the largest output by a laborer at his machine , present a pitiable contrast to the endless variety of thought-provoking tasks to which the farmer is daily called . The effects wrought upon the farmer 's character by the exactingness or exigency of farm work constitute a most important part of his experience . Unceasingly we farmers are made to realize that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Build the fence to-day ; a month from now the post holes will cost you twice as much . Sow the alfalfa to-day ; not another day in the season can it be sown with success . Pick up that strand of barbed wire today ; to-morrow your horse will be maimed by it . So fall , day by day , demonstrations of the needfulness of doing it now , ' until the desire to be prompt , to snatch the opportunity , becomes almost an obsession . Great as is the demand in the city for promptness , it is not so unpitying as the country demand , because in the city the demand comes largely through people , and people are not so exigent as things . People will receive excuses , provide substitutes , alter requirements . Things will not ; things , therefore , are more unmercifully exigent than human masters . Disciplined under such masters , it seems to me the country-bred must have greater ingrained power to do the hard thing and ' do it now ' than the city-bred . Closely allied to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives is the parsimony of nature . Nature does indeed yield some sixty , some a hundred-fold for labor done . But do you know what the average annual accumulation of the average Iowa farm is , omitting the rise in th. value of the land ? It is $164 , according to the way the Assistant Attorney-General of Nebraska figured it out from the United States census tables for an Iowa audience . According to these figures the average Iowa farmer is getting ahead $164 a year by his farm operations . ' Does that seem as ifnaturn pays bountifully ? I think she is considerably more bountiful than the figures indicate , for I do not believe they tool , into account all the factors in the business ; yet a survey of fifty counties in Illinois discloses the fact that an overwhelming majority of the farmers were Investigation of the accounts of 400 taunt in Wisconsin made by the State University slods that the average annual accumulation anionnt , to $800 , without deducting the living colons ' of the family . Were that deduction made , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount found to prevail in Iowa ticotalt trig to the figures gathered by the experts of the United States Department of Agriculture is surely a pitiably small wage ! ? THE AUTHOR . // not earning wages , while , at the same time , their farms were decreasing in ferMitv , When I called Professor Cyril Ilopkins 's attention to these state-nests , he said that a large part of the and of Illinois will not pay both adegnat wages and interest on the investment . The figures certainly emphasize t he fact that in the very nature of the ease the farmer can not be extravagant , that the parsimony of nature must teach him the solemn value of a dollar , the solemn worth of every hour of labor . Deepening realization of this lesson leads me to hold every aspect of waste or prodigality in contempt . For men and youths to go up to the city with that aversion ingrained in their souls seems to me one of the secrets of the power by which they lead . II But granted that the farm is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does it do for the intellect , some will ask . Professor Bailey of Cornell declared in one of his editorial prefaces that farming is the most difficult of all occupations . and he excepted none , neither law , medicine , engineering , divinity , finance , merchandising , nor teaching . I most devoutly believe he was right , and right if you weigh the matter from the point of view of acquiring knowledge alone . It is far easier , I believe , to acquire a degree of doctor of philosophy than it is to secure the information t that will equip a man to be a high-grade farmer . Two facts stand out conspicuously . in regard to the knowledge demanded for this purpose . The first is the vast range of subjects which it must cover ; the other is the extraordinary amount of thinking that must be done to apply it , Let this illustrate the range . There is a monthly magazine entitled The Experiment Station Record which is published by the Agricultural Department at Washington . Each number contains about one hundred pages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ review , running from a dozen lines to a half page , of the current publications bearing upon agriculture . During the year the publications thus noted amount to more than four thousand . These figures give a hint at the extent of current agricultural literature . Of all these publications the farmer need not , of course , read the one-thousandth part . But ultimately their substance must sift down to become the body of truth he is to master in order to do his work well . But over and above the literature of agriculture , there remains another vast body of knowledge to consider . I refer to the folk-lore of farming , or knowledge handed down through farm operations . I never talk five minutes with another farmer , never confer briefly with the hands , without picking up some valuable bit of knowledge which no printed page is likely to contain . After seven years of effort to grasp this folk-lore of farming ? this working knowledge of the occupation ? I feel so ignorant , comparatively , that I must perforce look up to and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those humble , unsung facts which are the sustaining walls of the structure we name civilization . Let me be more specific regarding these educational effects . Many a night I have said to myself , ' When , during all the days of professional studies , did I so examine statements , so balance conflicting views , so sift claims and expectations , as I have done this day in putting my knowledge to the control of men and events on the farm ? ' If that . be not discipline in the power of original thinking , where shall we look to receive such discipline ? Or , if it be precise 604 FROM THE STUDY TO THE FARM observation or exact memory that is in question , where will you place yourself to realize the importance of these intellectual disciplines as on a farm , where the wrong understanding of a single aspect of a process may cost the profit of your crop or your herd ? And as to the motivation of learning , how can adventitious prizes , marks , or diplomas compare in effectiveness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose can not be attained ? I have been pointing out conditions of farm life which , judging by my own experience , tend to develop strong types of character . But I have not assumed and would not assume that the conditions of city life do not also develop often the same types of strong character ; often , too , types which are complementary . And I go further and allow that after a man 's character has been well grounded on the farm , it may happen ? as a professor at Ann Arbor , himself once a farmer , maintains in the Atlantic ? that some of the best types of farmers are irresistibly drawn to the city in order to enjoy the satisfaction of doing seine one thing thoroughly , an opportunity which the farm with its Jack-of-all-trades ' life does not furn ish . And , moreover , I do not claim that the conditions I have set forth as conducive to high types of knowledge and virtue are effective with all men and women who live in the country . Upon my last visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend who had gathered about him sonic quarter of a million or more dollars ' worth of land . Far and wide stretched his thousands of acres , while he stood forth a very patriarch among men . But for one who knew the past of his great farm , how sad it was to point , here and there and all about , to the score of decayed homes which dotted its fields , and to recall how one by one the earlier own . ers of these homes had departed froin them beaten by the pitiless hard conditions which must be met to win success on the farm . They did not or could not meet them . And in so far as they failed , I am coMpelled to believe the task : , weakened , harmed them . If they lacked sufficient courage to start with , each recurring call to courage , unanswered , was , I doubt not , debilitating ; so was each unanswered call to promptness , to thrift , to inventiveness , to learning . And saddest of all , there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shift along and Wu ; on in spite of weakness and failure as he can on the farm . Consequently one finds on the farm a large proportion of men and women of exceptionally poor character . But even when men have failed to grow in strength in some of the ways indicated , they may yet have succeed . ed remarkably in other characteristics which the farm tends particularly is engender . Take sympathy , for which , as the popular drama truly attests , the farmer is often conspicuous . To what is it in part clue , if not to the farmer 's large dealing with animal life ? Not a day passes but I meet with some surprising exhibition of animal intelligenco and animal emotion , until an astonish. ing sense of comradeship grows tip for these inarticulate fellow creatures , ail astonishing desire to see that the are cared for when well and healed when sick . Such is the sense of fellowship which the unceasing contact with animal lire develops . What now is the effect upon the sense of human brotherhood whirl the unceasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions of men , tends to work out ? How can I answer this question more pointedly than by saying that just because of such labor // I feel that I could now have many times the usefulness as a minister that I had het'ore I came to the farm . No roughness of manner , no uncouthness of dress , no vulgarity of speech , no hardno , s or ugliness of feature could daunt MC out of my sense of human fellowship . In this ' words I am confessing an ex- clingly great service that has been it id ? a service which , if it could he done for every man and woman of every class that is exempt from physical toil , would go further , I verily believe , toward perfecting and preserving true don ( racy than all other influences amhined . The divisions into classes which have put chasms between people in the city have not prevailed to a like treo in the country . Being a toiler among toilers , working at the same tasks , the farmer is at one with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ device emerges a consciousness of diversified and supplementing excellenci , that keeps him in his inmost being a ( rue democrat . list ( rand here is a seeming , not a real con t radic Lion ) this same experience develops in the farmer a consciousness of the necessity of mastership as probably no other occupation develops it . At this point I shall again hear my personal testimony . You can realize how duet . It ly I , an inexperienced city man , eves if slightly endowed with modesty , Ad take up the task of directing cvicrienced farm hands . But to-day , though I know myself in points of knowli ? dge and judgment still inferior to the men about me , I have a deepen-a that I must be the master , they snot he the men . And ? here is the fine point of the business ? in so far as my judgment and knowledge do unquestionably excel theirs , I discover an ever-growing readiness on the part al the men to recognize the necessity of this mastership and to adjust themselves to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to receive their advice and follow it , without loss of position so far as their mastery of the matter is stronger than mine . Along with the exceptional preparation for mastership which the farm confers , goes its training for responsibility . The farmer 's ventures , as we have seen , are ranked as extra-hazardous . Ventures of such a type necessarily lay heavy responsibilities on the man who carries them . Day and night he must be ready to respond to unforeseen cares . Often have I said that of only one thing could I feel certain in the morning , ? that I should not be able during the day to do all that I had planned . Under such stress of calls a man will either grow shiftless , turning a deaf ear to the irritating summons to self-denial , or he will force himself to become more and more the servant of the work which is laid upon him to do . Going up to the city with the fixed habit of bearing whatever burden his occupation may lay upon him , he enters the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been limited in range and clearly defined . Look closely and it seems no mystery that the farm need fear no rivalry as the mother of men , ' as the London Times recently put it . Nor is there any mystery about the influence of the farm in so far as manliness is the outcome of wholesome outdoor sports . No one can have worked through seven seasons of farm work , with close attention to the workmen , without being struck by the great amount of genuine sport which they get out of it . When a half-dozen colts are to be broken , one can quickly see the elemental horse-tamer coming to life in the best of the men . The boys with the calves , again , are but a younger generation of men of the prime , once more wrestling with the wild life of forest and plain . And constantly , in the hayfield , amid the sheaves of the harvest , and in the furrow and corn-row ; the best effects of the rivalry of sports are seen . Or turn to joyousness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where have I known it in richer measure than there on the farm as one by one its hard tasks have been clone ? When once a fine wheat field had been reaped , ? when its golden shocks stood in martial array , safe from storm , far on the way toward feeding ; the hungry , there at set of sun , ? can you know the joy I felt in that labor clone , the affection that arose in my heart for the field which had yielded its rich harvest , the comradeship , t he attachment for the men who had helped win the labor to its triumphant close ? In that hunger for the old farm , believe me , there is something profoundly justified . That old farm has power to exercise and rejoice the heart of man beyond the common and superficial understanding of its value . The deep things of God are peculiarly there . And largely this is true because of its power to minister to the sense of beauty . Having passed nearly two months of every year for some thirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America , I feel that I know to a noteworthy degree what nature can yield to him who seeks her inspiration and solace under the advantage of lettered leisure . What I wish to say here in words as plain as I can use is , that what she yields under that advantage is small compared with what she yields to one who is brought into contact with her under the exigencies of farm work . To feel to the full the touch , the communion , the marvel of nature , be a farmer . Nature in her beauty is the great healer of the weariness and despair which nature in her utility lays upon man . At the bottom of every cup , said the enlightened Bossuet , ? at the bot tom of every effort , every experience , ? is emptiness , bitterness . At the end of every clay 's work is emptiness and bitterness because we are tired out . Complementary to man 's great need of achievement , then , lies his need of refreshment . This need nature meets overflowing abundance in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be lacking in the lot of the farmer , certainly richneSs of beauty is never lacking , And I believe that the degree to which that blessing enters into his life , even when he says little about it , even when he might laugh at you for saying that he cared for it , is nevertheless great , and that his habituation to the ministry of beauty is one of the sources of his power . But nature ministers to a yet higher need of man . She teaches him that there is only one power which can master might ? that is , right . I have said that if the farmer fails to rise to the stern demands of farming , he degenerates . There have been times when the exactingness and annoyance of inc work , the wretched turns of luck , so multiplied , came upon me so successive , ly and so cunningly , that in my hitter anger and rebellion the combination seemed perfectly devilish . I perceived then why belief in the devilish arose inevitably : Nature can play the eery devil . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of such experience than falls to the lot of most farmers , I am a better believer in the moral order than ever I was as a minister . Here is the great truth that has broken upon me , ? old , indeed , but ever new to each individual experience , ? the great trill h that existence pours onward in t wo vast streams . One stream consists of the outward universe of things , of externals ; the other consists of inner being , of conscious life ; and the world of things i5 the stimulus through whose resistance // and antagonism the soul is brought to power and perfection . Never a sadder po l or more dangerous hour did I pass than that evening at college when , after reading Bagehot 's Physics and Politics , teas so impressed with his portrayal of the savage , bestial origin of men 's most sacred institutions ? marriage , property , government , religion ? that the sure ( I , the adorable , seemed utterly hanisheil . I sat there , a lad , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Slowly , as the years the gloom lifted ; but never so passed . completely as there on the farm . For there as never anywhere else , I have been compelled to pit the powers of the soul against the might of things , and he longer the hard struggle goes forward , the more thoroughly am I convinced that there is no might or mutiny of things which does not conduce to charm and potency of soul . I realize , even to certainty , that right can and will rule might ; that the stream of soulpwer sweeps onward , never to be stayed , till it emerges into the City of God , and the divine appears , complete , everlasting , omnipotent . Why do I venture such a note as this ? Because I believe religion will never die while man strives with nature in the open and finds indisputably that nature is the foster-mother of the soul . The best fruits of Christianity have been those men of Teutonic stock whose ancestors had been most recently and must , completely men of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the hymns of the Rig Veda , which were poured out while the Aryans were still dwellers in tents . The child of the desert and the sky , the Arab , received Mohammedan-kin unto greatest power . Why ? Because elemental manhood was a product of iha open . In that fact will be found the summation of my reflections . You may question , as I also question , the co gency of some of the contentions I have maintained . But neither you nor I can question that elemental manhood was wrought into shape through life spent wholly in the open . There is matter of immense significance in this fact if we could spell it out . Man has been long in the making . During that tremendous process he was held close to the earth , he was a near companion of the animal , he was in constant contact with plants , he encountered , largely unsheltered , all the vicissitudes of the weather . It was these things of out-of-doors through whose play the elements of his intellect and conscience were wrought out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foundations of his being . What the pent-up conditions of the city have clone for him is vast and important , but is not elemental . The entire range of what we term civilization concerns itself rather with the superstructure , with the towers and minarets of the temple of manhood . The deep-placed foundations , yea , the walls and beams of that temple , were laid by the powers and influences of the open , of the country . When science shall have worked out this theme , as she will some day , then will it be clearly seen why nations , to be continuously strong , must cling to the country ? bide by and magnify the farm . Is , then , the all but impotent yearning of the city man for the country a , pleading of manhood for self-preservation ? Nine tenths of all the men in the city with whom I have spoken about the farm have expressed an eager desire to be farmers . It is , I think , really not that they wish to be farmers ? to do the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that they know not whereof they speak ; but it is that they hear the call of their elemental being , they feel the hunger of manhood for its first home ? the vast open , the gleam of the untainted sky , the odors of the 608 FROM THE STUDY TO THE FARM sod , the turmoil and conflict of the body with things , the thrilling revelations which the rough tutelage of nature forces on the expanding soul . Lacking these , they are dimly conscious that the best in life is lacking . And well may we question whether any civilization will permanently endure until one comes into existence which calls every man , woman , and child , part of the clay , to physical toil in the open , part of the day to mental toil within doors . That only can be the complete life of a human being , that only the perfect life of a nation . IV Consider now the bearing of our experiences upon some of the pressing questions of social betterment . There on the farm , working with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education , as I have insisted . I believe this step in essence must be taken by every one if the social crisis of our generation is to be happily surmounted . I say this step in essence . I am not foolish enough to imply that all men can live and work in the country even during their school-days . That is not necessary . The educational , moral , and economic disciplines which I have claimed for agricultural labor can be found largely in many forms of urban labor , ? in manufacture , construction , transportation , and the like , though not in so generalized and widely effective a forma It is the educational values inherent in all kinds of working with things whose overwhelMing importance has been , I believe , too largely overlooked . Why it has thus been overlooked will be realized by glancing briefly at the history of educational curricula . In Rome the central purpose of the curriculum was to prepare the patrician class for their duties as rulers ; in the early Middle Ages the curriculum was primarily intended to prepare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was taken under Arabian influences , was to train men for the profession of medicine ; with the rise of the canon law into a commanding position came the need of schools of law ; early in the nineteenth century , pedagogy acquired sufficient promi ? nence to call for a distinct course of study ; one by one , dozens of other lines of employment have sent forth their call and have been answered by the establishment of specialized curricula , But notice that , with slight if any 0- cept ions , the functions here named have nothing to do with hand-work . Lying thus apart from such work , these tasks can be prepared for without giving it any regard , and naturally wou Id be prepared for without this regard . Inevitably , therefore , whatever educational values might lie in hand-work would be overlooked . In brief , we may say that the university , being evolved to serve the purpos ? es of the ruling classes and their allies the professional men , had no occasion to search out the pedagogical possibilities involved in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or function of the public schools affect this conclusion , for they are simply an echo of the university , reflecting . so far as their limited aims permit , its ideals and judgments regarding the methods and purposes of learning . But if , in the beginning , the university had been conceived for the purpose of serving primarily the working classes , and their allies , the tradesmen , the educational values that lie in the manipu. lation of things could not have been so completely overlooked ; since , in order to prepare these classes for their func. tions , teachers would have needed to be hand-workers as well as book-expounders , and hence would have been led to find , perhaps , as great teaching ' alms in the work as in the books . // That these values appertain to intellectual training as well as moral training is implied by the experiences which I liniNlo been detailing . To repeat ? for I can not repeat the statement too emphatically ? these seven years we have spent on the farm have been some of the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our nature which no book-training could have brought into play . Yet beneficent as have been these farm experiences , they would have had far greater educational value could they have been given us along with our book-training , and under the same advantages of wise tutelage . It is this great unutilized opportunity which has left the education now given our youth but half an education , as it seems to us . The consequences of this failure to utilize the educational values that lie in the hand-tasks , in the occupations of the great mass of plain people , have led us to the verge of what may yet be one of the supreme disasters of history . First , it has driven too many people to the city . Almost the entire machinery of education to-day prepares for city life , not for country life . Consequently it can not make a boy love the tasks of the country . One of the comicalities in the history of education in America is stored away in the events connected with the first attempt to establish agricultural departments in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the other departments , to graduate into one of the older professions . Then arose men , under the lead of Dean Henry of Wisconsin University , who determined that a curriculum should be framed that would send its students bad ; to the farm . Great as was the success of this reform , the advance must go still further , as Professor Henry himself declares in a recent article regarding the next step necessary in agriculVOL. nj - NO. 45 tural colleges , namely , a step which will set the students at the actual work of performing farm operations while learning from books how they should be performed . That some influence must be set in motion to send , not only the students back from the universities to the farm , but , even more , the pupils back from their country schools to knowledge and enjoyment of farm work , is a matter of the first importance to the nation . It was hunger that constituted the leap of the tiger in the French Revolution , and hunger is none too far away from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multiply and magnify the work done on the farms . In an article whose thoughtfulness must needs make a lasting impression upon every one capable of taking a serious interest in the welfare of mankind , Professor Cyril Hopkins maintains that unless the refertilization of the fields of America is begun while the farmers are relatively well-to-do , it can never be done , from sheer lack of the necessary money to do it with . In Southern Illinois , it is declared , there are already thirty counties in which the credit of the farmers is so low that they find it difficult to purchase the phosphate necessary to bring the output of their fields back to a living wage . Now , one of the chief causes of this deplorable outlook is certainly the lack of rightly educated farm-hands . Were one to accept at its face value the talk to be heard constantly among his fellow farmers both in private conversation and in their platform speeches , he would conclude that the need of efficient labor is desperate . For my own part I can say in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now employed , could I secure those who would work as rightly specialized and rightly purposed hands could work . For mark , it is not only knowledge that is needed , 610 FROM THE STUDY TO THE FARM but far more a right attitude , right intention toward their tasks , which will resolve the farmer 's desperation over this problem of laborers . For this necessary resolution we must look to the school in the main . Ah , you say , but the country boy has had just the type of training , through working with things , for which you plead . No , surely no , not in its true aspects . Think you those farm labors could have educated my wife and myself as they have , had we not carried to them in a high degree book-trained minds ? You feel that I ought to have made this admission before . I reserved it for this significant connection . Trained by the best offices of the school , I the bookman have been a teacher to myself the hand-toiler . By virtue of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the disciplines my hand-toil was putting upon me , and consequently enabled to spur myself on to take those hard disciplines with eagerness . This is the function which is practically never performed for the country schoolboy . His hand-labors are no concern of his teacher ; his teacher , as a rule , has no acquaintance with them . She has no more been trained than he has to seek after or to appreciate their splendid disciplines , as those disciplines have been set forth in the earlier pages of this article . And further , and far worse , what is true of the schools in the country in this respect is true of the schools in the city . They do not train their pupils to appreciate and honor what is to be the work of their hands . Hence our supreme educational opportunity is lost . Reflect upon what almost universal rebellion against the most necessary labors of civilization is ensuing . The saddest of all facts brought out by the Titanic disaster was the fact that rebellion against physical discipline , which almost universally prevails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crew of the Titanic to man her boats . It is but recently that it was given out as the concerted opinion of our railroad presidents , that the grow . ing difficulty in enforcing orders is one of the most serious problems they are facing . From the manufacturer conies the same complaint about uninterested and unreliable workmen . They do not love their work , they do not honor its obligations , or revere its blessings , And why should they ? Does Society honor that work ? Behold by the very nature of your methods of education you prevent men and women from dis ? covering in their most educative years the glory and dignity of physical toil . While at the same time , by your system of industry , you drive them to perform that toil when they do not esteem it . Hence inevitably a growing sense of the inferiority of their position , a growing lust after what they are led to esteem superior positions ? a growing danger to the nation . Against this danger there in one power which could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education , which , by making all youths comrades in physical toil through all of school and college life , will bind them with ties which no subsequent diversifying of occupations can entirely rend . For whatever may be their tasks in after life , they will carry into them a realization that from toil with their hands came some of the noblest parts of their character ; that in toil of the hands lie some of the grandest opportunities of manhood . Such convictions would go far to strengthen the foundations of the Republic by vastly increasing , on the one hand , the joy , the conscientiousness , the efficiency of labor ; by vastly decreasing , on the other . the isolation of the people into classes with no binding ties of mutual sympathy and respect . // And such a consummation will go far also to preserve the sanctity of property ? which to-day is so seriously threatened . With increasing clearness comes the declaration that democracy is im-possible without equality of opportun-it y , but that no such equality of opportunity can exist so long as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to those who have not earned it . The most powerful corrective of the danger which lies in these views is not merely to diminish swollen fortunes , important as that may be , but above all things to diminish the swollen esteem which is set upon those fortunes . The best lesson my wife and I have learned from our life on the farm the realization , beyond the power of any moralist to convince us , that nothing we can buy with money has such worth , such deep sources of joy as the fruits of the labors we do with our own hands , heads , and hearts . V Hence this is our message for all who care to give heed to our experience ? the glory , the worth of life is not to the gender , it is to the producer . Let this fact be grasped with power , we have more than once exclaimed , and there would be effected such an inner revolution of aim , such a changed view of success , such a new goal of ambition , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violence . And until the supreme ambition of men and women is to become producers rather than possessors , to exercise every possible capacity rather than to possess every conceivable luxury , all the proposed reformatory programmes will prove at best ameliorative , never curative . Because , for one reason , while equality or property conditions , or any approximation toward such equality , might mitigate some of the crying evils of unevenly distributed wealth , it could not cause equality of effectiveness , which , at bottom , is the only aspect of equality that is worth a fig . While human nature remains human nature , such equality of effectiveness can no more occur than it can occur in the animal nature , and we know that centuries of the most patient breeding have not been able to cause it to occur there . But diversity of effectiveness , diversity of superiority even , may and does occur in all living nature . The tremendous desideratum in our social life is to cause each and every phase of this diversified excellence to be esteemed at its true worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficulty to effect such a revolution in esteem becomes more apparent the more we reflect that practically all children of all classes are brought up in the social atmosphere of Tennyson 's Northern Farmer . To a large extent we were all taught , if not exclusively , then by the strongest influences about us , that a fortune is riches , is power to spend what others produce ? If ability was glorified , it was because it would bring these riches . That ability in and of itself is the fortune , we were not made to feel . We were not inspired to believe that power to perform , joy of achievement , is the lot to be supremely desired and supremely honored . But if all the might of education were once thrown on the side of preparing for creation along every line of power , manual as well as mental , the lure of the power of purchase would surely undergo effective abatement . Until some programme of reform is launched that aims primarily at this revolution in the object of national worship , it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highest general weal . But , it may be thought , this is not progressive revolution which is being advocated , ? rather a degrading reversion to a social state where there is no distinction between manual drudgery and intellectual leadership . Well , to what extent should the distinction exist ? Drudging there on the farm , too weary to read when night came , too exhausted to feel a thrill of fine emotion , how clearly did it appear at times , that just a throw of the switch of circumstance in my boyhood , and lo ! I , too , might have been as ' The man with the hoe . ' It is not fair ; it is not fair that to a part of mankind falls all the physical drudgery , to the rest all choice social , esthetic , and intellectual delights . It is not fair and it ought not to be . Specialization has been woefully overdone . That is one of the clearest convictions to which we have been led by our farm experience . With the calmest judgment that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I had , from my early years on to these latter days of mature manhood , given one half my time to labor with my hands and the other half to intellectual pursuits , I should now be a far stronger man than I am , and I should have effected far more for the good of the world . My intellectual labors have been both curtailed and warped by the one-sided life which society has forced upon me . This paper has been written in vain if the reasons for this curtailment and warping have not been clearly recognized . To be lacking in the qualities of robustness , hardihood , courage , promptness , resoluteness , masterfulness , fellowship , initiative , and the many other qualities of intellect and character which received such marked enhancement there on the farm , is , beyond any doubt , to fall short of one 's highest possible powers of achievement . And it is also to fall short of one 's soundest powers of achievement . If one of the surest tests of an au thor 's weightiness is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is clear that he must be whole . Lopsided capacities will inevitably end in lopsided productions : As the ways of the world have gone , all this excessive specialization upward has been accompanied by excessive specialization downward . We have had authors in abundance who have been so far dissevered from the life of the toiling millions that their writings were sadly lacking in homespun solidity . And here were these millions so widely dissevered , by their excessive toil , from training for literature that so far as its benefit to them goes it might as well not have been . Is it not , then , high time that when men discuss specialization they bethink themselves carefully of ivs push downward ; and that , even if compelled to admit , as probably we shall be , that there is no discernible escape from the necessity for this push in case of genius and exceptional talent , we should remember that for ordinary men and women of culture there is no estate which they can at tain of so high a value as an all-round , poised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all types of men and women , and masterful in all the elemental resources and activities , Let the exceptional few , whom talent or genius has elected for extraordinary achievement , go their appointed way . They are not types of the race ; nor is the training which may be permissible for them permissible for cultivated men and women generally . These latter are to be the comrades , the helpers and in. spirers , of the common people ; they are to live with them and for them as wdl as by them or upon them . And to live thus as they ought to live , they must educate themselves or be educated the common tasks . ' Back to the country ' is a good cry to be uttered to city people ; but to the educated there k a better : it is , Back to your share of the tasks you are learning to shun or to sug- // ' utilize ; back to the toils which harden the muscles , quiet the nerves , make Inn the will , beget courage and hardihood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plain people . Thus , and I might perhaps say , thus only , all you escape the false pretentions , the artificial restrictions , which prevent the educated classes from being true elder brothers to the toiling millions . Do a share of the fundamental work of diose millions , and so shall you find a home in their hearts and they in yours . In the quiet joy of talking our experiences over , to this conclusion my wife and Inconstantly recur . We realize how vain an expectation it is to dream of a society in which all would share in the wholesome labors we delight in . And yet , in our moments of deeper reflection , we perceive that there is a profound under-push in the direction of this very impossibility . Self-preservation is pushing the wealthier and more idle classes thitherward ; self-realization drawing thitherward the poorer classes . Shortened hours of labor , it is true , have not brought the working clasSes to intellectual pastimes , but these shortened hours will bring their children more and more to such pastimes . Once the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of physical drudgery , the consequent ly heightened nervous powers will urge a larger and larger share of the younger generation on to general culture ? certainly as large a share , proportionately , as has been brought to such culture among the moneyed classes . At least in this possibility lies one dour chief hopes of advancing demoi'raCyto fuller sway without revolutionary violence . Much as I have pleaded for education through work , I believe thoroughly in education through the use of books , and I would strive for the day when every hand-worker should have such education in larger and larger measure . Much , for instance , as our farmer classes need vocational training , they need , far more , cultural training ? the ability to draw breath in the enchanted air of the groves of Academe . It is this diviner air carried to the farm , which has in large measure lent to its tasks the enchantment my wife and I have found in them . But a legitimate enchantment it is ? one to which all toiling farmers are destined by the push @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the farm is reduced by half and its intellectual and social delights are doubled . For , mark you , in sheer necessity of self-preservation the over-educated in books , the over-supplied with luxuries , the over-driven with society , ? who are so largely nervous wrecks , ? will be driven to take up a share of the excessive physical toil as the farmers and other hand-workers push themselves partly out of it . As a race we began by means of our methods of education , our laws of property , and our systems of industry to put asunder those things which God hath joined together never to be permanently parted ? hand and head . But everywhere in the sociological , the religious and educational fields is a stir , a low-murmuring on-coming movement which he who reads it aright discerns will bring the restoration of the perfect life of man ? the blended life of thought and labor ; labor trained to think , thought trained by labor ? the whole life .               @ @ @ @ @ @
