txt PLEA AGAINST DRAFTING MARRIED MEN NOT many men who have been certified for military service in the draft army will complain on the score of personal inconvenience , but the majority of them have a right to protest that Congress has been short-sighted in failing to understand what constitutes the best interests of the country at large . The national interest in time of war supersedes every other consideration . but Congress , in twice voting down the proposition to exempt married men as a class from the first draft call , seems to have been blinded to the social aspects of the case by the glare of its military aspects . Time and circumstances may alter the situation , but until they do , the preservation of homes and family relationships is at least paramount in its value to the nation with the raising of an army . The time may come when families should be broken up and homes destroyed in order to bring victory . but that time has not yet arrived . When it comes , these sacrifices will be made readily and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may seem a bit unfair to ask that a discrimination be made on the basis of marriage . But let them look at the case from a broad point of view . The married man who has established a family and has evidenced a sincere sense of responsibility in maintaining it , has thereby changed his whole mode and purpose of life . He has assumed a relationship , a responsibility , and a position In the community which the unmarried ? man has not . assumed . He has Created certain potentialities which , in the aggregate , are the source of the nation 's future population and progress . Though he may as yet have no children he has manifestly expressed a willingness to assume this responsibility . also . Ile and his wife have at least gone far toward establishing the mental , temperamental , and spiritual adjustment which is the very foundae tion of home and family life . In decreeing economic dependence as the only basis for the discharge of married men Congress entirely overlooked the fact that fundamentally it is the actual daily presence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it is the product of his labor . If he is taken away , the home is destroyed . no matter whether financial support for the wife and children may be found in other sources or not . But , inasmuch as the law has been enacted , it is necessary to face the situation it has created . The Provost Marshal General has ruled as follows : A man whose wife is mainly dependent on . his daily labor for support may claim exemption on that ground . But dependency is a matter Of fact . The rule does not ask . " Is the husband , as a matter of law , liable to support his wife ? " It asks , " is the wife , . aa .. a matter of fact , mainly clapenderiei on the daily labor of her husbatiditifii support ? " Only the exemption . boot:44A. : : can determine this fact . Note that last sentence : " Only the exemption boards " can determine the fact of dependency . This is the stumbling block of the whole law . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they could . if they went to extremes , shake the very foundations of the nation 's social future  --  and unnecessarily . As the result of this ruling , thousands of exemption boards are interpreting the word dependency in their own individual ways . Toeie is not only no concrete and workable definition to guide them . but there are now so many different definitions that no man with a right to apply for discharge on this ground can have any idea of his real status . Dependency , as it relates to an economic state . permits of no real definition . A woman whose home has been established on the basis of an income of $3,000 a year would , in order to maintain its status , require probably at least $2,000 if her husband were taken away ; yet she could give up her house or apartment and her maid , sell her table silver , buy two dresses a year instead of four or five , move to a poorer part of town , and exist on WO or $1.000 . Is she dependent on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or otherwise , she can get $600 a year ? In many such cases the exemption board has said she washusband iorararsTceey. have Yet hers is a case of a social unit of great potential value . which such action on the part of the board has temporarily , at least , practically de- stroyed at a time when such destruction was entirely unnecessary . There have been thousands of cases of married men who have claimed exemption because of their wives ' dependency , only to be turned down because their wives had formerly proved their ability to make their own living . More and more women are earning salaries before marriages bsit , when they marry their salaried jobs are supplanted by the bigger job of making a home . From the nation 's point of view , is it common sense to force such women hack into business and handicap them In a task which now , more than for generations , is absolutely vital to the nation 's future  --  when it is unnecessary ? Or take the case of a wife whose parents are financially able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not require it , the nation is both unwise and unjust in taking advantage of the situation in such a way as to disturb , if not disrupt . two homes . The draft la w authorizes the President to discharge wherever the men drafted are " in a status with respect to persons dependent upon them for support which renders their exclusion or discharge advisable . " in this clause lies a source of relief from the multiplicil y of interpretations of the word " dependency , " with the resulting and unavoidable injustice and unfair discrimination . The President has the power to interpret the word " advisable . " He can answer the question , " What is the status of dependency in the case of a married man which renders his discharge advisable ? " The theory of the draft law is that it shall be selective . This means that , after registering and analyzing the male human resources of the country between the ages of 21 and 31 , its administrators shall then select for certain kinds of service those persons best fitted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be denied that military service can best be performed by unmarried men . and that it will be better for the country if that principle is established . On the other hand , responsible married men who have established and are maintaining homes are best fitted , by continuing their relationships as husbands and fathers , to aid in the social progress of the nation up to that minute when such progress must be sacrificed to military necessityThe so-called Presidential regulations prescribe that married men are subject to draft in the following cases : 1 . Where the parents or other relatives of the wife or husband are able , ready and willing to provide adequate support for her . ( and children , if any ) ... during the absence of the husband . as.2 . Where the wife owns his absence to other persons so as to produce an adequate support . 3 . Where there exists some other arrangement by which the salary or wage of the husband is continued , in whole or in part , by third persons , being employers or insurers , and such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an allotment of his soldier 's pay or with other definite income , will furnish a reasonably adequate support . Inasmuch as the time is not yet here when such stringency is either desirable or necessary , the President might , with the hearty approval of the ration , and he has the power , to redefine " dependency " as -- That condition the disturbance of which by removal of the husband would cause the destruction or breaking up , either temporary or permanent , of a home established before June 5. 1917 , and responsibly maintained . It is scarcely necessary to say that if the war should not end within the next six months or a year , and another draft call should be required , the basis of exemption should then become one of dependency . But for the present it should make no difference to the President or the War Department how many married men wanted to join the army ? some means should ? he found of keeping them out until they , more than their homes , are needed . The draft act was passed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the particular point under consideration , the circumstances of a second year of war . But the temper of the country has changed to one of war conservation . The law should be reinterpreted in this spirit . MARK HUNTINGTON WISEMAN .
