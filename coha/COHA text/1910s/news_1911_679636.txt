txt To Stop Runaway Horses . Again , In to-day 's TIMES . I notice a serious accident resulting from a horse running away . The brave policeman does his best and often seems to tempt fate by his courage . All this could easily be avoided and the " runaway horse " problem be solved if light ropes with weight on one end were distributed throughout the police force . When an officer sees a horse beyond control , let him throw his rope at the horse 's legs . The light-weight end would curl around the legs and down he would have to go . Before throwing the rope he might shout to those in the vehicle to " hang on behind of them , " so not to be thrown ahead when the horse falls  --  for fall he must , and stop the vehicle surely will , and suddenly . This simple method would cure the runaway horse " evil and with , hardly any loss of life or serious injury . .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
