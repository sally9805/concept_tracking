Larousse Mensuel 11lustre is a unique and valuable publication , the only encyclopiedic periodical . The number for November contains a condensed summary of the events from September 12 to October 14 , and much information by different contributors on a great variety of subjects of present interest , historic , literary , biographic , and especially scientific . A long article on wood-eating insects is illustrated by two large colored plates , and there are 153 pictures , including many portraits . A Volume of humor is almost certain to be more entertaining as a reference book than as steady reading . This is the case with " Artemus Ward 's Best Stories " ( Harper ) , which is edited by Clifton Johnson , with an introduction by W. D. Howells , and illustrations by Frank A. Nankivell . Mr. Howells confesses to misgivings over the enterprise , and contrasts the humor of Browne , to give him his real name , with that of another by remarking that Browne felt bound , first of all , to make you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make you feel . Yet here and there he finds itt the work of the lesser man " a sweetness , a gentleness , a fineness in the humor , andwhich is not surpassed by anything that Clemens did . " Artemus Ward " overjoyed his generation " at least , and rendered genuine service by the delight which he gave Lincoln in the President 's harassed hours . " Who 's Who in Dickens " is , as further described on the title-page , " a complete Dickens repertory in Dickens 's own words . " The characters of the novels are listed alphabetically , with brief extracts to identify them . ' The book is compiled by Thomas Alexander Fyfe and published by Doran . The appearance , simultaneously , of " A Study of Francis Thompson 's Hound of Heaven " ( Lane ) , by Rev. J. F. K. O'Conor , S.J. , and " Francis Thompson , the Prestonborn Poet , with Notes on Some of His Works " ( Preston : Alfred Halewood ) , by John Thomson , witnesses to the steady interest in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the text of Thompson 's most celebrated poem , together with a two-fold interpretation  --  literal and mystic . The latter small volume will be read , we fancy , not so much for its own flattering judgments as for the critical estimates of Thompson which are reprinted from numerous periodicals , and for instructive anecdotes . No one will soon forget the picture of Thompson , , " clad  --  winter and summer alike  --  in a brown cloak , or ulster , and with a basket , like a fish basket , slung around his shoulders . In this he used to carry the books he had to review . " One of his colleagues on the Academy , for which he wrote , tells of how unbusinesslike he was : His copy ( always written on pages torn from penny exercise books ) came pretty regularly , but it was almost impossible to get him to return proofs . Neither imploring letters nor peremptory telegrams availed . Then he would walk in , calmly produce from his basket or wonderful pockets a mass of galleys , and among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telegrams unopened . Thirty years of service with sketch-book and pencil on the battlefields of three continents are summarized in the late Melton Prior 's " Campaigns of a War Correspondent " ( Longmans ) . Mr. Prior was not a correspondent strictly speaking . He drew pictures for the Illustrated London News , which is evidently a more hazardous occupation than writing word descriptions , since the search for draughtsman 's detail brings a man closer to the firing line . At least it did in the case of Mr. Prior . His experiences began with the Ashanti campaign of 1873 and ended , so far as the present volume is concerned , with the war in Manchuria . Actually , the Russo-Japanese war brought him no experiences . With other war correspondents Mr. Prior was kept dangling at Tokio by a rigorous censorship during the first period of the war , and though ultimately allowed to go to the front was not allowed to see any real fighting . In disappointment he sailed for England . The present account is written in plain , unpretending fashion , and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the Zulu campaign , when his sketch book with weeks of labor in it was lost , Mr. Prior did throw himself on the ground and break into tears . It was in this campaign that Napoleon III 's son lost his life . Mr. Prior and Archibald Forbes found the body after the Zulus had stripped it 1877-78 , and grew very fond of the Sultan 's people . What he has to say of Bulgarian atrocities during this war , as well as his experiences with the Christian rebels in Herzegovina , shows that rapine and massacre in the Balkans are not a monopoly of Islam . ? The avowed purpose of " Tripoli and Young Italy , " by Charles Lapworth and Helen Zimmern ( London : Stephen Swift &; Co. ) , is to justify Italy 's course in making war upon Turkey . For the bulk of the work Mr. Lapworth is apparently responsible , and one readily gains the impression that he is presenting a semi-official brief on behalf of the Italian Government , which naturally seeks to place its cause in the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italy has been unjustly condemned by her critics . He contends that this was not a war of capitalists , but one based on an urgent political necessity involving Italy 's very existence as a nation and as a Power to be respected . She had , he declares , either to establish her right in the Mediterranean or be encompassed by what he calls an " iron ring , " forged by Germany and other Powers which sought territory in North Africa . He also asserts that Italy could no longer tolerate the persecution of her countrymen in Tripoli ; that her right to the country had been acknowledged for many years by England and France ; and there were good reasons to believe that Italy would be forestalled by another Power ( meaning Germany ) " if she hesitated a moment longer . " There has been a reawakening of the national spirit in Young Italy , says Mr. Lap-worth . Social and economic reforms have been effected , and " the people feel that at last their country will take its rightful place as a great Power , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to expand under the Italian flag without having to emigrate and serve under foreign taskmasters . " There are chapters about Tripoli , its commercial value and future , if Italian plans do not fail ; a discussion of political , economic , and intellectual Italy , and a presentation of her attitude towards the rest of Europe . The book is illustrated and has a map of Tripoli . Incidentally , the accusations of butchery and treachery on the part of the Italian soldiers are refuted . The name of the author is sufficient guarantee of the authority of " Fire Prevention , " by Edward F. Croker , ex-Chief of the Fire Department of New York city ( Dodd , Mead ) . The value , in any case , of a volume ii this field from his pen is enhanced by the fact that it was written for the general reader , who has been neglected by writers on this subject . While the bulk of the book is devoted to considerations of protection for lives and buildings in cities , due attention is paid to prevention . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduction is an unanswerable indictment of our present methods of construction . " If I had my way about it , " Mr. Croker affirms , " I would not permit a piece of wood as big as a man 's finger to be used in the construction of any building in the United ' fates which had a ground area larger than 25x50 feet and was more than three stories in height . " He is no less emphatic tion , he holds , must be of a type which will make the choice of instantaneous exit or death unnecessary Fire escapes can not insure safety The building must be so constructed " that the flames may be confined to a limited area within which to burn themselves out , consuming only that part of the contents which can not be removed to safety behind doors and partitions which will resist fire as effectively as the walls themselves " In both the range of its topics and their manner of treatment the book is a notable contribution to what almost deserves to be called a new science It should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring about the improved conditions for which it pleads . It is well supplied with apt photographs of fire-fighting and apparatus , and has a good index A new edition of Elizabeth Robins Pennell 's " Our House and the People in It " ( Houghton Mifflin ) contains fifteen illustrations by Joseph Pennell , and has in consequence undergone a transformation of title into " Our House and London Out of Our Windows " It is hardly necessary to say that these sketches are not only a delight in themselves , but they have an appropriateness which can be asserted of few pictures that are intended to adorn a tale Most of them , as one would expect , show London as through a glass , darkly The text is apparently unaltered A redipping into it confirms the favorable opinion of this account of servants and acquaintances , good and bad , but mainly bad , expressed in the Nattba November 24. 1910 Prof James Seth 's new book , " English Philosophers and Schools of Philosophy " ( Dutton ) is the first number forthcoming of what promises to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and its purpose is to present English philosophy as literature It has been remarked that , while French philosophers.have been for the most part mathematicians and physicists , and the Germans theologians or university professors , the more conspicuous of the English philosophers have nearly all been men of affairs Thus it happens that , not only is the style of English philosophy characterized by the absence of severity and technicality ( in the words of Mr Seth ) , but the interest is nearly always close to the immediate issues of life And it is not too much to say that " English philosophy is entitled to be called literature in a sense in which the philosophy of perhaps no other nation has the same right to the name , " or that it includes many names of those who deserve to rank among the masters of English prose To a student of philosophy it is always incomprehensible how a course in English literature can omit , for example , such a vividly personal document as Berkeley 's " Principles " ; or how a student of English can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read Hobbes If he desires a problem in the complication of motives  --  well , philosophy , not French , is a complication of motives , and in English philosophy he may find a nice problem in Berkeley , a more evident but still very interesting one in J S. Mill . In the field of literary criticism he will find nothing much fine : than Martineau , nor , perhaps , Mr Seth dissent-mg , a better illustration of the possibilities lish tongue Of Mr Seth 's book it should be said that the purpose has been kept well in mind The book is long enough tor a leisurely treatment , not so long as to be burdensome The style is finished and careful , and the text is skilfully interwoven with quotations by means of which , in the case of the more important philosophers , the reader acquires insensibly a taste of their style More to the point is his catholicity of insight , which is the more commendable because the prevailing empiricism of English philosophy is hardly ' n line with his own point of view He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philosophy , however impersonal in form , is the expression of a meaning deeply personal , and his book is an illustration of the statement that philosophy thus interpreted is literature On the other hand , it is a gain to see that English philosophy is not so blankly empirical as it is commonly represented to be And in the light of the past it is interesting to read his summary of present tendencies , as exemplified in pragmatism and " the new i ealism " " In all of them alike we may see the effect , somewhat paralyzing , of the great scientific movement of the latter halt of the nineteenth century upon the philosophical mind of the English-speaking ra.ie . " " The Correspondence of William Shirley , Governor of Massachusetts and Military Commander in America , 1731-1760 , " has been edited by Charles Henry Lincoln and published in two volumes by Macmillan . During the last ten or fifteen years American scholars have devoted ' themselves with commendable zeal and excellent scholarship to exploiting the unprinted sources which throw light on the Imperial side of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a rapidly increasing list of publications , both of documentary material and of monographic studies To this new material , the correspondence of Shirley is a useful addition The collection consists mainly of letters of Shirley to the Duke of Newcastle and to officials in other colonies , but some letters from Mrs Shirley to the Duke of Newcastle , some from the Duke of Newcastle to Shirley , and some instructions to Shirley , have been included Altogether the two volumes contain about 450 documents , most of which have not been printed before . The great majority of the letters have to do with the military events of the two wars in which Shirley was so actively engaged So far as details go , they increase our knowledge of these events considerably , and they confirm what is already known of the difficulty of obtaining effective cooperation among the colonies for any scheme of general defence They have rather less to say than might be expected about contraband trade , but they have a good deal to say about the neglected and very important subject of paper money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , letters make it clear that while the paper-money legislation of the colonies often discriminated against English creditors , there was a real need for such currency , a need which was recognized by Shirley and Colden , among others , and by the English Government itself prior to the adoption of Grenville 's shortsighted policy Shirley discusses at length the question of Indian policy Of the necessity of dealing with the unoccupied lands from the point of view of Imperial defence and Indian relations , he was fully aware , and his letters as early as 1755 suggested the policy which was afterwards embodied in the Proclamation of 1763 . " Pure democracy , " declares a former president of Princeton , in a volume recently come from the press , " can not subsist long nor be carried far into the departments of State ; it is very subject to caprice and the madness of popular rage .

It=is proposed that the works selected by a committee of the Association be published by the institutions with which the authors were connected The present book is the memorial of a somewhat untoward event in the intellectual history of America President Witherspoon did much to strengthen Princeton , and to give to it a commanding educational influence throughout the Middle and Southern States , but he also made the Scottish philosophy of common sense the official Princeton doctrine " On his arrival " from Scotland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found the tutors and thinking men in the College eagerly supporting the idealism of Berkeley , and upon them he mercilessly fell with argument and ridicule until he had driven ?
