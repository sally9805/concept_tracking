ON almost any day of the year you may look south from Constantinople , across the Sea of Marmora , at a broken line of blue hills that remind you a little of the mountains bounding the Venetian lagoon . Those blue hills , or the clearest and easternmost of them , belong to a high wooded promontory that divides the Asiatic end of the Marmora into two unequal gulfs . Along the north shore of the upper and longer gulf runs the Bagdad railway ? by which , no doubt , you will one day travel in your international sleeping car from London to Delhi . And , having passed the hilltop grave of Hannibal , you will see your last of blue water at Nicomedia , which Diocletian made for a moment the capital of the Roman empire . Near the south shore of the lower gulf lies , at the foot of the Bithynian Olympus , the old city of Broussa , first capital of the Turks and the Pantheon of the founders of their power . But no imperial tradition and no modern highway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is true that emperors did resort of old to certain hot springs in a fold of the blue hills , which turn green as you approach them . A persevering company even tries to-day , without too flattering success , to rehabilitate that fallen Asiatic Carlsbad . There is no reason why the company should not in the end succeed . The blue-green hills are in themselves a romantic enough piece of nature , pointing into their bright east-Mediterranean lagoon . Above the Gulf of Nicomedia they rise the more abruptly , and are more thickly wooded . The other side , protected from Black Sea winds and open to all the sun of the south , is a little Riviera of olive , cypress , and vine . But people do not forget that brigands have been known to amuse themselves by carrying off the clients of the baths . And other resorts are more modern in their appointments . So the blue-green hills , although in sight of the world , remain out of it . Not quite wild and not yet civilized , they make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ races , stubbornly immiscible , lodge scattered and uneasy among the old Greek ghosts of the land . On the south shore of this peninsula , not far from a Turkish village that is half lost among immense cypresses and plane trees , a deserted garden looks across the Gulf of Moudania at the Asiatic Olympus . You would hardly know that a garden had ever been there , were it not for a tumble-down little kiosque of two or three rooms , overlooking the beach , such as the Turks always like to build in their country places . There are also poppy-grown fragments of wall , and , in the central jungle of green , the ruins of a house ? or of the foundations of a house . But what most visibly marks the spot as an old pleasure ground is a great bronze giraffe that lifts its awkward neck among the trees . To a foreigner , indeed , a life-sized image of a giraffe might not suggest a garden . The Turks , however , regard statuary somewhat as the Anglo-Saxons do . They are afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , therefore , and set about imitating them , they not uncommonly replace the classic garden god by a statue of an animal . So it is that that ungainly bronze giraffe , made in Germany , stands in a tangle of Turkish green on an old Greek shore , a monument if you like and a symbol , staring strangely across its little blue sea toward the country of Antinoiis . The villagers say , now , that the house of the giraffe would be standing yet , and that Nousret Pasha would not have been killed , if he had listened to a gypsy . She prophesied to him that if he finished the house it would burn to the ground and he would die . But he was not the man , Nousret Pasha , to be frightened out of a thing he had set his heart upon ? even by a gypsy fortuneteller . For he was incredibly ignorant . He said the gypsy would have made a different prophecy if he had given her what she asked . Moreover he knew well enough that nobody wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if he loved anything . He was born there , and passed his youth there , and made a reputation there as a pchlivan ? a wrestler ? and had been one of those who amused themselves by carrying off the clients of the baths on the other side of the mountain . That he found profitable as well as amusing . In the course of time , however , he found even more profitable and considerably safer game in Constantinople , where he became a notorious figure during the last years of the old regime . He was a huge man with a big jaw and no neck , and beady little eyes set close together . He had always been a dandy . In his second period his humor took the form of shrill waistcoats , lumpy jewelry , and unquenchable perfumes . He used to spend a good part of his time driving about Pera in a gaudy yellow satin victoria that was better suited to a comic opera queen than to a dirty ruffian like himself . He would sit up very straight in the middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this way and that . Very little escaped those beady eyes . And if they happened to light on anything that pleased Nousret Pasha , why Nousret Pasha generally ended by having it . For he was the Sultan 's milk-brother . His mother , that is , had been the Sultan 's nurse . And so , although he was born of a humble family of peasants in an obscure village of the Marmora , Nousret ended by becoming a pasha and the pattern of a scoundrel  --  all through a pretty piece of Oriental sentiment . It was incredible how many people Nousret Pasha ruined or did away with , how he robbed right and left , and went into every imaginable form of rascality that promised an instant 's amusement or a para 's worth of gain . Not that his requirements were as a usual thing so modest . He made a tremendous income simply out of blackmail , threatening to send the Sultan such and such reports unless such and such sums were forthcoming . For he was one of the Sultan 's most indefatigable spies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he was a first-rate shot . Nousret Pasha had learned to shoot in his native mountains . He had always been passionately fond of hunting . That was one reason why he built the house of the giraffe . He kept any number of horses and dogs down there . The villagers say he often kept bears as well , which he brought home as cubs from the mountains . When they got too big he would set the dogs on them . He liked to watch the poor brutes being torn to pieces . Bears and dogs , though , were not his only company on the peninsula . He often took visitors down to stay with him . One of them afterwards starred in the second-rate cafe-chantants of Hungary as the Princess Nousret Pasha . In fact it was rather dangerous to decline an invitation to the house of the giraffe . One young woman was shot because she did ? she and her mother and her servant and her dog . Nousret Pasha walked into the house one night when they were at dinner and coolly potted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raise a finger , simply because he was Nousret Pasha , and Nousret Pasha was the Sultan 's milk-brother . On a certain summer day in 1908 , Nousret Pasha was driving , not in his yellow satin victoria but in a smart trap , over the hills on the European shore of the Bosphorus . He was being driven , that is to say , by his coachman , Ali . This dark , slight , good-looking wearer of a braided black livery was , although the Pasha never put it to himself in so many words , the pasha 's best friend . They had been boys together in the Marmora ; they had hunted , wrestled , and kidnaped together , and Nousret Pasha had done very little since in which Ali had not had a part . Yet you would not have thought so from Ali 's face . He had the simple , honest , serious look of so many of his people . And certainly he was by nature one who would have done the Sultan more honor as a milk-brother than Nousret Pasha . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leader , and because Ali had eaten his bread for so many years , Ali remained faithful to his master with a faithfulness which only a Turk or an Albanian can know . As they jolted down the stony road that leads from the top of the hill to Stenia Bay , they passed two ladies walking by themselves . In town it would not have been easy to get a definite impression of two promenading Turkish ladies ; but being in the country , these two wore veils only over their hair , and no enveloping charshaf . Nousret Pasha accordingly perceived , being a connoisseur in such matters , that one of the ladies was extremely handsome . She had long and rather narrow dark eyes , over which eyebrows arched so delicately on a fair skin that he knew they were not painted ; and from beneath the white veil escaped a strand or two of wavy hair that had a reddish glint in it . The second promenader was apparently the servant of the first , and the pasha wasted no glances on her . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ servant were worth looking at . He immediately nudged Ali and Ali immediately turned around . The two walkers betrayed a certain surprise at seeing the trap a second time . Nousret Pasha kept his beady eyes on them , or on one of them , as he went by , and for some distance beyond . He then signaled Ali to turn again . But before this subtle manoeuvre was completed the two objectives of it disappeared into a gateway beside the road . Nousret Pasha had an instant of surprise . Having reached the same gateway , however , he directed Ali to stop . An Albanian porter came out , thinking a visitor had arrived . Excuse me , ' said Nousret Pasha politely , but I am not quite sure where I am . Can you tell me whose house this is ? ' The porter took in the shining trap , the trim coachman , and the conspicuously dressed and perfumed gentleman who accosted him , and answered , with his hands respectfully crossed on his girdle , This , effendim , is the house of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Alt ! ' uttered Nousret Pasha , turning his beady eyes on an underling who did not call him Pasha at first sight . He then drew out with his most important air a silk pocket-book , diffusing a cloud of music as he did so , and handed the porter a large printed card . Give the bey this . ' He lifted his chin , to ease it of an uncomfortable collar , and glanced down sidewise at the porter . Those ladies who just went in ? they are ? ? ' It is the family of the bey , ' replied the Albanian , a shade more gravely . For the visitor had transcended the limits of good form . H 'm . Just tell the bey I came . ' And dropping a gold piece into the porter 's hand , Nousret Pasha ordered Ali to drive on . Ahmed Bey , as a matter of fact , was one of the last people in Constantinople upon whom Nousret Pasha would have taken the trouble to call . He was too honest to be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But even such a man might have his possibilities , it seemed . Accordingly when Nousret Pasha got home that night he an- flounced to his wife that she was to go to Emirgyan the next day and call on Madam Ahmed Bey . For there had been something in those long eyes under their arched eyebrows that made him think this a case to go about with circumspection . As for Madam Nousret . Pasha , she was by no means unused to such commands from her formidable spouse . She had led a somewhat varied career herself , and had thereby picked up a philosophy . She duly went to call on Madam Ahmed Bey , in a closed brougham with a black eunuch sitting on the box as if to guard the dearest treasure of the pasha 's heart . Madam Ahmed Bey received her caller politely , not knowing at first who she was . But Madam . Ahmed Bey failed to return the call . Turkish ladies of the old school are not quite so meticulous on such points as European ladies , however . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a nobody like Ahmed Bey . Madam Nousret Pasha accordingly gave a party at her own country house in Bebek , and the first person she invited was Madam Ahmed Bey . Madam Ahmed Bey , as it happened , was otherwise engaged for that day . And being asked , later , to set her own ( lay for coming to Bebek , she replied that she suffered from ill health and never went out . This course of events was a little longer drawn out than Nousret Pasha expected . He had grown used , among his own people at all events , to have every one come when he whistled . Who was a Madam Ahmed Bey that she should refuse the advances of a Madam Nousret Pasha ? Yet she was , he could not forget , the possessor of divinely white skin , and waving hair of red glints , and eyebrows inimitably arched , and long dark eyes that he meant to see again . And he was a hunter , adept in all coursings and doub lings . So he at last sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ card , that he would dine at Emirgyan on such and such a night . One may do that in the East ? and a man like Nousret Pasha best of all . Nor may a man like Ahmed Bey refuse such an invitation . He therefore prepared accordingly . He engaged extra cooks , he hired dancing girls and dancing boys from the Jews who deal in such commodities , he caused inquiry to be made of his prospective guest as to what other guests should be invited . Nousret Pasha made answer that he desired to dine in intimacy , and that no company could be preferred to that of his friend Ahmed Bey . With his friend Ahmed Bey he consequently dined , and the affair went better than he expected . Ahmed Bey seemed to wish to make up for his wife 's coolness toward Madam Nousret Pasha . He showed Nousret Pasha his garden , which , having been inherited from grandfathers and great-grandfathers , was not ill to look at , albeit somewhat wild and overgrown . He then took Nousret Pasha into a wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apologies , such a dinner as Nousret Pasha knew how to appreciate . One feature of the dinner , it is true , was not altogether Turkish . Nousret Pasha , to the knowledge of many men , although a good Mussulman , had acquired a taste for alcohol . Ahmed Bey , therefore , having discreetly hinted that there was wine in the house for medicinal purposes , and having received intimations to the effect that it was always well to forestall the disease by the remedy , produced bottles to which his guest did due honor . The host afterwards asked himself if he had made a mistake . At all events when the table had been removed , and fingers and lips had been rinsed in a trickle of perfumed water which a servant poured from a slim silver jug into a silver basin with a perforated cover , Nousret Pasha had so little forgotten what he came for that he turned to his host and said , Ahmed Bey , we are becoming more and more modern as we grow old . Why should not your wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sultan 's milk-brother could go far , but he had not really believed he would ' go as far as this , in the house of a man whose bread he had eaten . ' My pasha , ' he replied gravely , I am very sorry , but my wife is ill . ' Ahmed Bey , ' retorted Nousret Pasha , ' it is not necessary to lie to me . Your wife is not ill . My wife has seen her ? and so have I ! ' Ahmed Bey swallowed the insult . My pasha , ' he persisted , ' it is some days since my wife had the honor to receive Madam Nousret Pasha . I swear to you that she is unable to come into this room . ' The two looked at each other . Nousret Pasha felt it unnecessary to give too black a look , for the man was too much in his power . Still , the look of the beady eyes was not pleasant , nor were the words that followed it : ? ' Ahmed Bey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring her lute as well . It is good to have a little music after dinner ? and dancing . ' To a European that might sound simple enough , for a European is proud to have his wife make music for other men , or even to dance for them . With the Turks , however , a woman may sing and dance for one man only . If she does it for others she belongs to the half world . Nousret Pasha had therefore made of Ahmed Bey the demand that a man may least accept with honor . Yet Ahmed Bey knew with whom he had to deal , and how much depend ed on what passed between them . He knew , too , that Nousret Pasha had had wine . And , after all , Nousret Pasha was his guest . I have thought of music , my pasha . There are girls and boys waiting . I will call them . ' He clapped his hands . A servant entered . But before Ahmed Bey could give the order Nousret Pasha got up and thundered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall I go myself ? ' For a second Ahmed Bey would have thrown himself on the man . But he was unarmed , and he knew that Nousret Pasha always tarred a revolver and could use it better than any one . He probably would like nothing better than to use it now ; and then what would be gained ? Ahmed Bey signed to the servant to leave . ' I go , my pasha , ' he replied at length . Kindly have patience for a few moments . ' And , with a low salaam , he went out of the room . For a time Nousret Pasha was sufficiently amused . It always amused him to make other people do what he wanted , especially when they did n't want to . The dancers amused him too . They sang long melancholy songs , accompanying themselves with tambourines , while one boy played a pipe and another beat two little drums made out of earthen jars with skins stretched over their mouths . They danced long dances , ? the slow sensuous dances of the East @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their arms to and fro . The air , meanwhile , began to grow heavy with the perfume that burned in a brazier . When Nousret Pasha was pleased with the performers he gave them a gold piece in a glass of mastic . But he began to be impatient to see Madam Ahmed Bey dance , with that reddish hair falling around her white shoulders and her long eyes half shut . He clapped his hands for a servant , who told him that Ahmed Bey was almost ready . Let the pasha have a moment 's more patience ? and in the meantime take wine . It took Nousret Pasha some time to realize that he had been tricked . He was naturally slow of wit , and he was too used to tricking other people to believe they would dare to trick him . Only when he called his troop of dancers after him and explored the house did he take in what Ahmed Bey had clone . The door of the harem was locked . Nousret Pasha battered it in , finding the rooms lighted and full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there ? not even a servant . He rushed down through the empty house to find Ali . The doors leading into the garden were all locked . And they were harder to batter through than the one upstairs . But Ali , roused by the noise , came out of the porter 's lodge to help him . He had seen no one leave , he said . He had been sitting with the door-keeper and the Jew who brought the dancers , until a servant came to call the Albanian ? who had not come back . When the way was open the pasha ran out into the garden , revolver in hand . A summer moon helped him in his search among the shrubbery ? and the dancers who followed him . They looked like a troop of bacchantes , with their loose hair and gauzy costumes , as they played their motley hide-and-seek in the moonlight . Nousret Pasha was too furious to remember that he had at his command an elaborate secret machinery for catching people ? and keeping them as long as he chose . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the house once more . He rushed upstairs like a madman , opening doors , bursting into cupboards , tearing aside curtains . He began tearing them down , and shooting at windows and chandeliers . When his cartVOL. - NO. 6 ridges were gone he used the butt end of his revolver . ' Brea k ! Break ! ' ' he shouted . ' Leave nothing ! ' His band of revelers needed no second invitation . They filled the house with the crash of glass and the splinter of wood , and they ended by setting the place on fire . Those old Turkish houses only wait for a chance to burn ; and too many lighted lamps were thrown on the floor of this one . When the firemen came hooting , half-naked , from the neighboring villages , they found little of the house save a column of lurid smoke towering into the moonlight . Nousret Pasha brandished his revolver at them from the garden . His fantastic company sang and danced around him in the glare , their faces streaked and streaming , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blazing house . The Jew who had brought them cringed in the arch of the gate , half terrified at the uproar , half reassured by the all-powerful presence of Nousret Pasha . In the road outside , his face strangely lighted , stood Ali at the heads of his plunging horses , patting their quivering necks and talking to them as gently as he could amid the crackle and the screeching . Under ordinary circumstances the story would have had quite a different end . Ahmed Bey did not have much the start of Nousret Pasha , and Nousret Pasha had eyes and ears and hands everywhere . But it happened that the night which proved so eventful for Ahmed Bey and Nousret Pasha proved no less eventful for their imperial master , Sultan Hamid . There was much galloping of horses through the usually quiet streets of Beshiktash under that summer moon . Ministers remained in anxious consultation long after mid- night at Yildiz Palace . Telegrams flashed back and forth between that guarded hilltop and distant Salonica ? telegrams fateful for the destiny of the house of Osman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bed it was half consciously , borne in the arms of his attendants , exhausted as he was by rage and fatigue . And in the morning three lines of print appeared at the top of all the papers , announcing that the constitution of 1876 had been reestablished . Nousret Pasha did not chance to see those three lines . Nevertheless he quickly had occasion to discover that something had unaccountably happened which he , the Sultan 's chief spy , knew nothing about , and which ' spoiled the world , ' as he put it to Ali . The police , who had been so deferential when he first gave his orders with regard to Ahmed Bey , presently dropped the case . They even had the courage to intimate that he might have something to answer for in the matter of Ahmed Bey . Other people , too , treated with as little respect , or actually cut , him whom they had been used to salute with earth-sweeping salaams and kisses of the hand . It was the more puzzling because the Sultan still spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the Sultan continued to be his friend , others dared to show themselves less . The Sultan tried , not too successfully , to explain that it was because he , the Caliph of Islam and Shadow of God upon Earth , could no longer do as he pleased . And he made Nousret Pasha a handsome present and advised him to get away to Europe while he could . In the end it was Ali who got Nousret Pasha away . An and Madam Nousret Pasha persuaded him to leave the house that very night , taking only money and papers and a little jewelry and going out by the stable door to the house of a friend of Ali 's . Ali in the meantime helped Madam Nousret Pasha to pack , and early in the morning drove her clown to the Moudania boat in the yellow satin victoria , which he put on board with his mistress and her boxes and her black man . For she was going to retire for a time to the house of the giraffe . Then Ali went home and dressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the costume of a wrestler , with fawn-colored breeches and a short embroidered jacket of the same color and a huge silk girdle and a red and yellow silk turban with the fringe hanging over one ear . It was in truth a costume which became Nousret Pasha much better than any other , and time was when he had worn it with pride . But it was with very little pride that he went out in it now , accompanied by Ali ? who no longer wore his trim black livery ? and two of Ali 's friends . They crowded into a common open carriage of the street , and they bought red badges of the constitution which they pinned on their sleeves , and then they drove down to the Bridge and right through Stamboul as if they were going to some wrestling match . And they went on , through Kazli and Makri-Kyiii. and San Stefano and Floria . It was already dark when they came to the brow of a hill and saw the lights of Kiichtik Chekmejeh below them , and the reflection of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not much time to the train , and he told the Pasha that if any one asked who he was , he was to say he was Mehmed , a wrestler , and that he was going to Adrianople for his trade . Nousret Pasha did n't like it , He was not used to having people ask questions about him and watch him . It made him think , somehow or other , of Ahmed Bey ? and of Madam Ahmed Bey . He wondered where they were , and how he was to find them now . It was a clear still night , so still that he could hear the crickets in the dark plains , and the lapping of the water on a little beach near by . Fishermen were there , busy over their boats , laughing in the darkness . He envied the fishermen . No one asked them who they were and where they were going . Kalolimnos ! Kalolimnos ! ' one of them shouted . ' Who is going to Kalolimnos ? The steamer is starting ! ' Nousrei Pasha heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water . He got out of the carriage . For Kalolimnos is an island off the cape where he was born . Come , Ali , ' he said , as he started toward the beach , ' I am not going to Adrianople . I am going to Kalolimnos . From there we can go to our country in two hours . ' In the station a bell of two notes struck , and somewhere in the darkness a whistle faintly shrilled . Ali ran after his master . ' Come ! ' he whispered , catching hold of the pasha 's arm . ' The train is here . After all this how can we miss it ? ' If you like , take it , ' answered the pasha , breaking away . I will not . What shall I do in Europe , among the unbelievers ? I am going to my own country . ' He jumped on board the fishing boat . I am going to Kalolimnos , ' he said to the fishermen . ' How much do you want ? ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ station , ' where are you ? The train is coming . ' Ali , on the beach , heard it coming . It suddenly burst out of the cut beyond the village and bore down upon them , a long curve of intermittent lights . It stopped . In the sudden quiet Ali heard the water lapping the shingle , the quick crunch of gravel under feet , a musical tapping of metal , sharp questions and answers . Ali held out his hand to the pasha , who caught it . ' Come ! ' said Ali in a low voice , pulling toward the beach . No , you come ! ' laughed the pasha , giving a stronger pull toward the boat . Are you coming too ? ' asked one of the fishermen . Another bell rang , ending in three strokes . A whistle blew ; some one shouted and some one else replied ; the intermittent lights began to move slowly forward . Ali watched them touch face and tree and water , quicken into a yellow blur , and disappear . He heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a sinking of the heart . He said nothing however ? except to make arrangements with the fishermen . They were not too curious about their unexpected passengers . When they heard that the wrestler was not really going to Kalolimnos but to the peninsula beyond , they suggested landing him there ? for a small extra consideration . Ali thought it might be better than attracting attention at the island and hiring another boat . He merely told them to touch at the point of the peninsula . As for the pasha , he felt more like himself than he had felt for days . He made himself very comfortable at the stern of the boat , on the matting and sheepskins of the fishermen . He slept soundly there , oblivious to the splash of the oars , the rising of the moon , and his heavy-hearted companion . When he woke , the sun was already high and they were skimming merrily along under a patched balloon sail . The low white hills of Kalolimnos were behind them , to the south ; beyond the sail he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landed on the north side of Boa Bouroun , the weathered gray nose that was sacred of old to Poseidon . From it they made their way without difficulty , over the rocks and through the woods they knew so well , toward a certain colony of great black cypresses . And Nousret Pasha 's heart grew lighter with every step . But when he came to the last turn of road and looked eagerly for his house , no house was there . Only the trees , and the head of the giraffe , showed above the wall . IV Nousret Pasha and Ali looked at each other . The same thing flashed into the mind of each , ? that the house had burned down , as the gypsy had prophesied . And that was not all the gypsy had prophesied . As a matter of fact the house had burned down , and so recently that the garden was full of the acrid odor of charred wood , and the air still quivered hot above the ruins . Among them old Moustafa was poking with a stick ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of steps he turned . At first he did not recognize the strangers . Then he came humbly forward , salaamed , and kissed his master 's hand , touching it to his forehead . What is this ? ' demanded the pasha , with a return of his old air . They burned it , ' replied Moustafa , his hands folded in front of him . They burned it ! Who burned it ? And why did you let them burn it ? ' What could I do ? ' stammered the old man . ' They were many ? They came from the village ? There was much talk ? The world is upside down since every one speaks of constitution . But it was written , my pasha , ' he added , as if there were nothing more to be said . Yes , it was written , the pasha told himself . And why had he let that train leave him last night ? By this time he would have been in Europe , and safe . The consciousness of it was stronger than his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less roughly . ' What became of them ? ' The smell and ruin of the place made him think of Emirgyan . The old man waved his hand . Gone ! They took them all ? furniture , horses , dogs . Only that is left ' ? pointing to the giraffe that lifted its neck among the scorched trees . They even took the silk carriage that came last night . The Kaimakam has it . ' And the Hanum ? ' inquired the pasha , suddenly remembering his unfortunate wife . He wondered a little that he listened to it all so quietly . She went back to Moudania , they said . I did n't see her . Some thought she was going to Broussa , and others to Stamboul . ' Nousret Pasha 's heart grew heavy within him . His country , indeed ! He had never imagined that the sudden madness of the world would reach even here . And his countrymen had done this to him , whom they had always known ! After all , what had he done to them ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few girls , was n't it what they all did when they got a chance ? And had they had enough , or was it written that they must require something more of him ? His beady eyes brooded dully on the giraffe . As for Ali , if he felt heavy of heart as well , he did not betray it . Is the kiosque left ? ' he asked at last , or did they burn that too ? ' No , ' answered Moustafa , ' they left that for me . ' ' Eh , what more do we want ! ' exclaimed Ali . ' Let us go and sit down there , and Moustafa will make us a coffee , and we will see what we will do . ' They went , and they sat down on a little divan overlooking the blue gulf , and they saw what they would do . Or Ali did . He told the pasha that he must stay quietly in the kiosque for a few days , without so much as showing his nose outside the garden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one troubled him , while he , Ali , would go away and arrange something . Only the pasha must let him have money , much money ; for without that it would be impossible to arrange anything , now . The pasha made haste to produce the money . He only wished All did not have to go away . When All had gone away he fell into a state of something nearer a confused introspection than he had ever experienced before . How had it all come about , and why had everybody turned against him ? It made him angry . It seemed to him that Ahmed Bey must have brought it about Ahmed Bey who was nothing . Where was Ahmed Bey , he wondered ? Where had they run to that night in the moonlight ? What were those long eyes looking at now ? He would see hem again , those long eyes ! Yet , for the first time in his life , he felt afraid . He could not forget that gypsy woman . He could not bear to see the ruins of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seemed to him an eternity before Ali came back . With cigarettes and coffee , however , and gossip with old Moustafa , and a good deal of sleep , the time passed . And it was less than three days , after all , when Ali came back . Ali had been to town , it seemed ; and he brought strange news . All their old friends at the Palace were gone and the Sultan was left alone , among strangers . Selim Pasha and Izzet Pasha ? that clever Izzet ! ? had run away to Europe . The others , or those who could be found , were being shut up in the War Office , and these new people ? whoever they were ? were taking their money and houses . They had even taken what they could find of Nousret Pasha 's ! By the time Nousret Pasha heard this he was quite ready to hear what All had arranged . All was still for Europe , it seemed . By the help of a friend or two , and much money , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Black Sea to the Mediterranean , should stop for a little while , that very night , off the island of Marmora . In the meantime a tug , by which in fact Ali had run down from Constantinople , was to come as far as the house of the giraffe at nightfall and take off Nousret Pasha , in order to put him on the German steamer . The tug was to be trailing a tender , with men in it all ready to row . They would begin to row as soon as they saw certain lights in the window of the kiosque , and the passenger would only have to run down across the beach to be in safety . In the meantime they must continue to stay quietly in the kiosque . And hrt , Ali , would try to make up a little sleep . In truth he looked as if he needed it . He had grown visibly thin and there were black hollows under his eyes . Yet the pasha noted with envy that he had had a shave . He himself had had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Nevertheless at the return of Ali the pasha 's vapors dissipated . And at this hour to-morrow he would be on board the German steamer ! No fear of his refusing this time to do what Ali said ! It might be rather amusing , after all , to go to Europe . He wondered if he would meet any of his friends there . There might even be some one on the boat . But this absurd costume of his ! And his four days ' beard ! What would he not give to be able to go to the bath in the village ! Who would know him ? Certainly none of the bath boys ; they changed so often . For a moment he almost thought he would go . Then he decided he would send Moustafa to call a barber . Moustafa could say that he had a friend who had hurt his foot , and they would give the man a good tip , and by the time he got back to the village it would be too late to do any harm , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cogency of this reasoning . To the village accordingly old Moustafa went , and got the nearest barber , who happened to be a Greek and who took pains to leave word where he had gone . So Nousret Pasha was made in a manner presentable to the daughters of Europe , despite the unworthy wrestler 's costume . And so was the gypsy woman justified of her dark words . It may be , indeed , that Nousret Pasha 's vanity might not have been his end , even when word was taken to the Kaimakam that the Greek barber , having been called to the house of the giraffe , ? or what was left of it , ? was unable to attend his excellency . For his excellency also patronized the Greek barber , as one who might more readily be left unpaid than one of the faith . But the mention of the house of the giraffe reminded his excellency of a certain yellow satin victoria he had lately confiscated on behalf of the constitution . He desired to keep in favor with the constitution , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house of the giraffe . Accordingly , unshaved as he was , he took a drive in the yellow satin victoria in the cool of the day , to the end of the peninsula , where , somewhat to his surprise , he beheld a small tug anchored in a cove of rocks . He caught Nousret Pasha without the slightest trouble . He took the precaution to post his men out of sight , and they drew up as twilight fell . The thing was not done , of course , without a few shots . The shots frightened the tug away , however , and nobody was hurt . As for Nousret Pasha , who had such a terrible reputation , he did nothing . He merely said , ' It was written , ' and got into the yellow satin victoria like a lamb . The Kaimakam got in too , and a couple of soldiers . The Kaimakam would have let the servants go . After all they were not to blame for what their master did . But All chose to consider himself under arrest as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yellow satin victoria rolled back in the summer dusk to the village . V The Kaimakam drove straight to the telegraph office . He wished to report his prize to Constantinople , and incidentally to ask instructions . For he had no authority to shut up Nousret Pasha , who might very well have committed all the crimes in the code , but against whom no one had produced a warrant of arrest . To the telegraph office , therefore , the Kaimakam drove , and left Nousret Pasha under guard in the victoria while he composed his telegram . A crowd began to collect in the little square . A crowd collected around the carriage , that is , for people had already been sitting where the coffee-house lights twinkled under the plane trees . The Kaimakam 's new carriage and enormous horses were things to look at by themselves . When it became known who was sitting in the carriage , dressed like a wrestler as of old , the crowd trebled . Among them were not a few who had helped to loot and burn the house of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coach man ? of Ali too , whom several of his old acquaintances gravely greeted . The coachman nudged one of the soldiers and asked him to hold the reins for a minute . The soldier agreed willingly enough . He was cramped from sitting on that little front seat , and there was no lack of people to watch Nousret Pasha , So the coachman got down . His arms ached from holding in those big Hungarians . And the soldier got up . Ali looked at him in the dark . He seemed to be a big , mild , elderly Anatolian , such as used to serve Sultan Harnid by the thousand , in ragged blue uniforms piped with red , and seldom got paid for it . Have you any tobacco , brother ? ' asked Ali . ' A little , ' answered the soldier , handing him one of those capacious metal boxes that somebody in Turkey must make a fortune out of . Ali rolled himself a cigarette with deliberation . When he handed the box back the soldier nearly dropped the thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Ali looked at him . ' That will get you some tobacco , ' said All in a low voice . ' They are all gold liras . Give me the reins and jump down . ' The soldier hesitated , feeling cautiously under the cover of the box with one finger . He let Ali take the reins . All touched the other soldier on the arm . Will you change places with your comrade ? ' he asked . ' He is not used to horses like these . ' The big Hungarians reared and began to back . The soldier on the box jumped down . The other looked around doubtfully . The horses still pranced . The crowd parted a little . ' They might make a calamity , ' said the first soldier . The one in the carriage got out , in order to mount the box . Hold on ! ' shouted Ali , to whoever had ears to hear , letting out the reins and cracking his whip . The big horses bounded forward , scattering the crowd in front of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yelled the Ka'imakam from the steps of the telegraph office . He had just composed a telegram that satisfied him not a little . But it was too late to stop them ? unless the shots that banged in the little square had taken effect . None of them did . It was not for nothing that Ali had been born and brought up in that village . He knew every stone and tree and turn of it in the dark , and in three minutes he was past every possible mishap , on a long flat road where nothing could stop them , in that rail-less and motorless country ? except the telegraph . He hardly knew at first what direction he took , save the one that was nearest for safety . Now he realized that they were galloping east , for the mainland , for Anatolia . That was better than the tip of the peninsula , where they would have been caught like rats in a trap ? unless they found a boat . But the telegraph , in the end , could gallop faster than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through Asia Minor in a yellow satin victoria that everybody knew . Nousret Pasha had resigned himself , when the soldiers first surprised him , to the inevitable . But spirit came back to him as he found himself rolling safely away through the dark ? though there was still something cold at the bottom of his heart and he wished the horses ' hoofs did not thunder so . He reached forward now and then and pinched or patted Ali . What a boy , after all , was this Ali ! So the fugitives sped all night through the dim country of their boyhood . On one side of them the sea made soft noises against rocks and shingle . On the other side a mountain rose black to the stars . Dogs barked , every now and then , from invisible farms . After a time the moon rose ? the same moon by which they had made their voyage in the fishing boat , by which they had danced in Ahmed Bey 's garden , by which Ahmed Bey had run away ? the same moon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair would look by it , and if , somewhere , those long eyes were seeing it too . And now it made the road into Asia a little lighter for the big Hungarians , and for the fat man sitting behind them in his coquettish satin carriage , half grotesque , half tragic , trying to outrun his destiny . The cocks were almost past crowing , and Olympus , on the other side of the gulf , was already touched by a fairy light , when they came to a village in the hills where All knew there was no telegraph . There they would be safe for a while at least , and they must rest and feed the horses . Then they would make one more stage inland , and get rid of that tell-tale turn-out as they could . After that ? They drove to the khan , in order to arouse less suspicion , and roused a hostler . The proprietor whom Ali knew had gone ; but his successor was willing to accept a handsome tip , to stable the horses , to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clients were driving from Yalova to Broussa , and to give them a place where they might rest . Nousret Pasha , having eaten something , rested very well . All could not . He could not think , even . After a while he got up and sat at the window that looked into the street . It looked into part of the opposite garden , too , beyond which a wide green country dropped into the blue of the gulf . How cool and like a paradise it seemed in the early sun ! And where in all that paradise could he find a place to hide this foolish master who snored behind him ? How could they escape being caught , in the end ? Why , after all , should they try to escape ? What was written was written . But his heart grew heavy to think that he must yet accomplish what was written . It was written , however , that he should not have to wait very long . As he sat pondering his ways and watching the sun mount higher over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some one moving in the opposite garden . It was a woman , evidently not a peasant , in a loose gray dress , with a white veil over her hair . She walked down a path trellised with grapevines . Then she turned into an open space of grass where pomegranate trees were blossoming . She looked up at the window , conscious that some one saw her . And Ali suddenly became aware that she was Madam Ahmed Bey . She at once drew her veil across her face and stepped out of sight below the wall . Did she recognize him too ? How should she ? Yet if she did ? Ali hesitated but a moment . Glancing at Nousret Pasha , he went out softly and asked whether he could hire any horses . The khanji said he had none ; he doubted whether any could be found elsewhere in the village that day . All ordered , accordingly , that his own be harnessed at once . If the khanji thought anything , he said nothing . Most wrestlers did not travel all night in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then rest barely two hours before beginning to travel again . But everything was upside down since this affair of the constitution . The carriage was presently ready , with fodder for beast and man , and Ali called his master . Nousret Pasha came somewhat unwillingly to consciousness . But Ali looked so grave that he asked no question and made no remonstrance . A few minutes later they took their respective places in the victoria , and the hostler threw open the doors of the court to let them out . As the horses clattered through the archway Nousret Pasha saw Ahmed Bey on the other side of the street . For an instant a commotion seized him and he looked beyond Ahmed Bey , search- ing the lattices of the house . But the commotion subsided and the old coldness rose within him when Ahmed Bey caught hold of a bridle . Nousret Pasha , are you running away ? ' asked Ahmed Bey in a strange voice . Nousret Pasha 's coldness began to 1w warmed by anger . ' Ali , whip him ! ' he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He whipped the horses instead . And this time there was no crowd , as yet , in front of them . But they did not break away . Doors and windows began to open . People came out of the khan . Peasants stopped in the street . Nousret Pasha ? ! ' Ali lashed the tired horses . The whole village would know in an instant , if Ahmed Bey went on bawling that name . As a matter of fact the name began to be repeated in the street . It was a name the village knew for a name of rumor and of terror . But Ali could not turn the horses into the straightaway stretch , because of Ahmed Bey who pulled them back . And though Ahmed Bey was his master 's enemy , Ali did not wish to hurt him . Between the two of them the horses began to plunge . Then Nousret Pasha got up , reached across the box , snatched the whip out of Ali 's hand , and lunged at Ahmed Bey . Ahmed Bey drew back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman 's voice from behind a lattice , ' this is Nousret Pasha , the spy of Sultan Hamid , the drinker of blood , the destroyer of souls ! Will you let him go ? ' They did not let him go . How do such things happen ? Some thrill in that woman 's voice , some buried fury against intolerable wrongs , some spark of those that flash from man to man when many are together , set on fire in those gathered peasants the wildness that lies dormant in us all . Ali , sitting on his box above it , trying to manage his terrified horses , heard the whistle of the whip that had been wrested from him , and fierce shouts , and a thudding of stones and blows , and gasps of quick breath , and his own name called in mad fear , and other sounds inhuman and unnameable . The tumult sprang up and quieted like a blast of tropic wind . When in the end Ali could look around he saw that the satin of the carriage was more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was very little of a man . What had happened to that man was what happened of old to the bears he caught in the mountains , when he set dogs on them , at his house of the giraffe . And so was fulfilled the destiny of that house and of its master .
