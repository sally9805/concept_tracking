txt A Country Problem . The milk investigation is blowing over , and what has the farmer won ? Nothing except the privilege of producing milk and selling it at a loss ; of subjecting himself on the one hand to rules and restrictic ns of Increasing severity . and , on the other , to a market over which ne has no control . Forty thousand farmers supply milk to New Tork-2,000,000 quarts a day . Many of these dairies are being conducted at a loss , and many would be found to be paying little or no profit on capital invested , if the time and labor of the farmer , his wife , eons , and daughters were counted in . While thousands of men are without employment in the city , farmers in the country can not secure ' sufficient labor at any price . Laborers from the city are not content with country conditions . When will the city wake up to the tact that there is a country problem and give the farmers a square deal ?      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
