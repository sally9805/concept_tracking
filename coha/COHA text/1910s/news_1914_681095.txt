txt It appears that the campaign of the subsidy men against the repeal of the coastwise subsidy has reached its climax and is beginning to lose force . It has been very ingenious , considering the grounds on which it has necessarily been conducted , but its ingenuity is of the sort that does not tithe note of the reason or the conscience of the public . A shrewd pub , lie man in this city was , on one cccasion , discussing the probable future of Davin B. HILL , then seemingly in command of the politics of this State , and said in substance : " Mr. Iitaa 's " success may be called self-limiting , " and I think the limit is approach " ing . His conception of politics has " two serious defects . He appeals " chiefly to the interest of his associates and subordinates , and , sooner " or later , he can not satisfy them , for " there is not enough profit to go " around . And he does not under " stand the tremendous influence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years later the Hill machine fell to pieces , though in the Senate Mr. Him , showed himself much more of a statesman than he had previously shown himself . The subsidy men are proceeding on a policy plainly marked by these same defects . Their immediate ? appeal is to the protectionist greed which the Democratic Party has just succeeded , after long and arduous labor , in eliminating in great degree from the tariff . They do not realize that this is something very limited in its influence now , and that the old protectionist domination perished precisely because there was not enough profit in protection to go around among the innumerable swarm of seekers after it . The secondary appeal of the subsidy hunters is to racial and national and ? we are ashamed to say  --  to religious animosity . They have tried to make it appear that the repeal of the privilege accorded to the coastwise monopoly is opposed by one class of our foreignborn or foreign-descended citizens and by the Church which the great body of them revere . We are gratified to be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results that had been expected . The attempt to arouse anti-British feeling among Irishmen at the moment that the British Government is risking its political existence and facing the threat of civil war in the attempt to give home rule to Ireland has awakened the derision and contempt of a good many earnest and rational men with Irish blood in their veins . The more insidious attempt to drag a great Church into a miserable intrigue for the advantage of private interests , already unduly favored , has aroused indignation . Still more conspicuous is the error of the subsidy-hunters in estimating the real force of the moral sense of the American people and the effect of its activity upon an issue involving the good faith of the nation . Now this is a matter as to which the " schoolmaster " in the White House has shown himself far better informed than the acute politicians who are undertaking to fight him . One reason doubtless is that ho has kept vital and active his sympathy with that moral sense . He has , so to speak , superior facilities for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of keeping promises . When he reads in the treaty of 1901. the following pledge of the United States solemnly made by our Government for ample consideration he knows what it means to him , and that it means the same to the great ' body of his fellow-citizens : T. The canal shall be free and open to the vessels of commerce and of war of all nations observing these rules , on terms of entire equality , so that there shall he no ? discrimination against any such nation , or its citizens or subjects , in respect of the conditions or charges of traffic , or otherwise . Probably , the Prqsident has kept himself well informed as to the expressions of public sentiment in the papers and through personal utterance , but he must have felt that that sentiment would not and could not , on so plain a question , differ very much from his own . And he is right .
