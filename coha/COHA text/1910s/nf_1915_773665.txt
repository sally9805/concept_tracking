txt // these two fibre-systems is in proportion with the injury of that nucleus . Lesions of the nucleus fastigii produce no degeneration in the cord . Besides Marchi 's bundle , another efferent cerebello-spinal tract , mostly crossed , but to a small extent direct , has been described by Mingazzini , Pick , and others . The crossed portion leaves the internal segment of the restiform , body , enters the raphe as internal arcuate fibres , joins the external ventral arcuate fibres of the opposite side , and enters the pyramidal tract ( Fig. 228 , c , d ) . The few uncrossed fibres pass as external ventral arcuate fibres and join the pyramid tract on the It is evident that the crossed portion , since it decussates again with the contralateral pyramid , joins each lateral half of the cerebellum and of the same side of the cord , and that the small uncrossed portion , which also decussates with the homolateral pyramid , establishes a relation between each lateral half of the cerebellum and the opposite side of the cord . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determination of the functions of the cerebellum is one of the most difficult problems in the physiology of the central nervous system . We devoted many years ( 1884 ? 91 ) to experiments in the solution of this question . Previous investigators had confined themselves almost without exception to ascertaining the immediate effects of lesion or partial removal of the cerebellum or its peduncles . Rolando ( 1809 ) contented himself with destroying half or the whole of the cerebellum in different mammals , and giving a summary description of the effects on the same day , without taking any trouble to keep the animals alive . Fodera ( 1823 ) and , shortly after , Flourens ( 1824 - 42 ) observed , particularly in birds , the immediate effects of small successive ablations of increasingly deeper layers of the cerebellums. // Study of the remote effects was only at t emitted very inadequately by Flourens , and always on birds . Magendie ( 1828 ) , Serres ( 1826 ) , and Bouillaud ( 1827 ) in their experiments followed more or less on the lines of Rolando , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiments on the cerebellum were resumed by N. Schiff ( 1858-59 ) , Brown-Sequard ( 1859-60-61 ) , R. Wagner ( 1858-1860 ) , Dalton ( 1861 ) , Lussana ( 1862 ) , Leven and 011ivier ( 1862-63 ) , Vulpian ( 1866 ) , Weir - Mitchell ( 1869 ) , Nothnagel ( 1871 ) , Ferrier ( 1878 ) , and others . At the outset of our own researches on the cerebellum it seemed to us advisable to extend our study to the higher mammals , dogs and monkeys , in which the organ is more developed , but which till then had rarely been employed for experiments on account of the supposed technical difficulties . Our principal experiments may be divided into three series , viz. investigation of animals after removal of the lateral half of the cerebellum , of the vermis , and of the whole or almost the whole of the organ . Before describing the results it seems advisable to make a few preliminary remarks for the guidance of the student : ( a ) Whatever the extent or degree of the cerebellar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or bilateral , complete or incomplete , the resulting symptoms are disturbances of voluntary movement . ( b ) Unilateral lesions of the cerebellum produce disturbances chiefly on the same side of the body ; while the effects of removing the so-called motor region of a cerebral hemisphere are mainly crossed , i.e. on the opposite side of the body to that operated on . ( c ) Whatever the nature of the cerebellar lesion , the true phenomena of deficiency , i.e. those due directly to loss of the cerebellum , are preceded by a brief period of functional exaltation ; while in lesions of the cerebrum the phenomena of ' deficiency are constantly preceded by a period of functional inhibition . To be rigorously objective , we will refer to the immediate effects of ablation of the cerebellum as " dynamic phenomena , " leaving undecided the question of whether they are produced by the irritation of the operative traumatism or by the sudden cessation of the influence of the cerebellum upon other portions of the nervous system . ( d ) To the phenomena of cerebellar deficiency of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which we have termed " compensatory phenomena " ; these are due to the activities of portions of the cerebellum that are left intact , or of other cerebral centres . In the first case there is organic compensation , which consists in the gradual diminution of the phenomena of deficiency in the second case there is functional compensation , // which consists in abnormal movements directed to meeting and partially compensating the effects of deficiency . ( e ) The phenomena of cerebellar deficiency , in association with the processes of functional compensation , make up a syndrome or characteristic complex of phenomena , which has long been known by the generic name of cerebellar ataxy . It is the task of physiology to make as exact an analysis as possible of the individual elements that go to form this ataxy , with the object of distinguishing the phenomena due to loss of cerebellar innervation from those due to the instinctive or voluntary compensatory acts , which are directed to nullifying the effects of the former . ( f ) As each lateral half of the cerebellum is connected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is obvious that the symptoms of unilateral cerebellar extirpation must be greater on the side of the operation than on the opposite side . Hence , comparison of the two halves of the body in an animal from which one-half of the cerebellum was removed is equivalent to comparing two animals of the same species , age , and constitution , one of which is in full enjoyment of its cerebellar innervation , the other almost entirely deprived of it . III . If not too deeply anaesthetised or enfeebled by bleeding during the operation , dogs show signs of distress and agitation immediately after complete removal of one-half of the cerebellum . The animal also presents pleurothotonus or curvature of the vertebral axis to the side operated on , tonic extension of the anterior limb on the same side , with clonic movements of the three other limbs ; rotation of the neck and head towards the healthy side , slight nystagmus and squint with inward and downward deviation of the eye on the side operated on , and downward and upward of the eye on the healthy side ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same direction as that of the neck and head ( i.e. from the side operated on to the healthy side if the animal is looked at in front , from the healthy side to the operated side if it is viewed from behind ) . The immediate dynamic phenomena after total removal of the cerebellum are agitation , unrest , and cries from the animal ; opistliotonus , or backward curving of the vertebral axis , particularly of the neck and head ; tonic extension of both fore-limbs , with alternating clonic movements of hind-limbs ; bilateral convergence of the eyes ; and tendency to stagger and fall backwards . These symptoms may seem more simple than those which follow unilateral destruction , but they are really the same dynamic disturbances spread over both sides . Opisthotonus is substituted for pleurothotonus ; tonic extension of 1 Both limbs for tonic extension of one limb , regression and falling backward for rotation on the long axis . After destruction of the vermis and , generally speaking , after // incomplete bilateral or unilateral , symmetrical or unsymmetrical injuries , . the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and extent . In all cases the dynamic phenomena approximate more nearly to those of unilateral or total extirpation , according as the peduncles of one side , or those of both , were similarly affected . The immediate dynamic symptoms persist for a few days ? usually eight to ten ? if the wound remains aseptic ; the tonic spasms diminish in strength and duration , and become transformed into clonic and oscillatory movements . The first symptom to disappear is the rotation on the long axis , or tendency to fall and topple backwards ( which usually lasts only four to five days ) . The last to disappear is the pleurothotonus or opisthotonus , which remain evident for a number of days if the animal is suspended . As the tonic spasm disappears and the movements become merely clonic and tremulous , the animal 's attempts to hold itself upright and to walk gradually become more effective . Dogs , as a rule , regain the power of floating and swimming before they become able to walk . In monkeys , with the exception that there is tonic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dynamic symptoms are identical with those described in dogs ; but they are less intense and of shorter duration , so that the phenomena of cerebellar deficiency are more plainly seen after a very few days , when every trace of the forced movements disappears . The exact interpretation of the origin and nature of the dynamic phenomena is one of the most difficult problems we meet in the physiological study of the cerebellum , and is so far unsolved . The feature which has more especially claimed the attention of experimenters from Pourfour du Petit ( 1710 ) , Lafargue ( 1838 ) , Magendie ( 1839 ) , Schiff ( 1849 ) , Longet ( 1878 ) , to the workers of the present day is the rotation of the animal on its own longitudinal axis . Does this depend on the irritation of the fibres of the cerebellar peduncles by the operative injury or on the sudden removal of the influence of one-half of the cerebellum upon the rest of the nervous system ? In our Monograph upon the Cerebellum we declared for the former view , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and others , and characterised as irritative all the dynamic symptoms that predominate immediately after removal of portions of the cerebellum , as Goltz had given the name of inhibitory to those which ensue directly on cerebral ablation . This view is supported by the following arguments : ( e ) They correspond with the degree of operative injury and with the appearance of inflammatory and infective processes in the wound . VOL . III 2 F // ( b ) They predominate in the side exclusively or mainly affected , and appear to be more pronounced and varied in proportion as the lesion is deeper and extends farther towards the cerebellar peduncles. ( c ) When the peduncles are partly degenerated , in consequence of previous removal of the vermis , the later destruction of a lateral lobe only produces slight and transient irritative symptoms . Ferrier , however , showed that when there is actual irritation or inflammation in the cerebellum the dynamic phenomena are very different from what we had described . He found that when a lateral lobe of the cerebellums was partially cauterised so that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opposite direction to that which we observed after removal of one side of the cerebellum . We had never performed cauterisation experiments on the cerebellum as they appeared unsuitable for eliciting clear and unequivocal physiological facts , but on repeating Ferrier 's experiment on a number of animals we convinced ourselves of the accuracy of his observations . We found that more or less profound cauterisation of the cortex of a cerebellar lobe on one side gave rise to symptoms that were almost exactly the opposite of those seen after its removal . The disquiet and cries of pain are absent ? the animal rather appearing depressed and subdued ; the pleurothotonus to the injured side is replaced by slight pleurothotonus to the normal side ; the tendency to rotate and actual rotation round the long axis from the operated towards the healthy side is replaced by a tendency to rotate in the opposite direction , i.e. from the healthy towards the operated side . On what does this reversal of effects depend ? The question is still undecided . In reply to Ferrier we advanced the hypothesis that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including the Jura mater , which is a sensory membrane capable of producing symptoms of reflex inhibition on excitation . This , however , is not an adequate explanation . Are the pleurothotonus and rotation in the opposite direction to be referred to the preponderance of inhibitory effects on the operated side or to exaggerated activity on the healthy side ? A recent experiment on dogs indicates that it depends on both these factors . We observed that if before cauterising the cerebellum on one side the two halves of the cerebellum were divided by a median sagittal section , the animal appeared subdued with pleurothotonus to the cauterised side , and a slight tendency to rotate towards the healthy side . Next day the animal was quiet ; it lay on the flank of the cauterised side , and if forcibly placed on the opposite side made a half-turn to recover this position , but showed no tendency to rotate on its axis ; if held up there was pleurothotonus to the // cauterised side , but no rotation of its head towards the sound side . Mechanical excitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predominating in the muscles of the opposite side . Nothnagel observed in 1876 that puncture of the vermin with a fine needle on one side of the median line , or of one cerebellar hemisphere , produced pleurothotonus or curvature of the vertebral column to the opposite side , with rotation of the head in the same direction , i.e. opposite to that observed after removal of one-half of the cerebellum . But reactions also occur in the fore-limb and facial muscles of the excited side . Lewandowsky and J. Munk confirmed these results ; they found that fine needles must be used in order to evoke them , because with coarser lesions the irritative symptoms are mingled with those of the paralysis and produced quite different phenomena . Sergi repeatedly found that simple section of the lower and internal portion of a cerebellar hemisphere , including a part of the peduncles , produces a tendency to rotate , or actual rotation , in a direction opposite to that which we observed after unilateral cerebellar extirpation , and comparable with the effects of cauterisation . Electrical stimulation of one-half of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Weak induced currents produced restlessness and consecutive movements that suggested that the animal was suffering from vertigo . Stronger currents produced a forced position towards the side opposite that excited ( right pleurothotonus when left side is excited ) ; movements of facial muscles and horizontal nystagmus of the head ; falling of the animal to the right if excited on the left , and rotation in the opposite direction to that observed after unilateral extirpation . Lewandowsky , of course , assumed that there was true irritative rotation in his case , and that ours was due to paralytic rotation . On the other hand , Pagano ( 1902 ) , working in Marcacci 's laboratory , found that merely injecting a few drops of 1 per cent solution of curare into one cerebellar hemisphere in dogs produced violent epileptiform reactions mainly of the muscles of the same side , and especially various rotatory movements ? ten to fifteen minutes after injection . Two general propositions can be positively stated , without danger of contradiction , in regard to the rotation round the longitudinal axis that is constantly seen after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Predominance of the functional activity of the cerebral centres of one side is a necessary condition for forced rotations , : 111 ( 1 the afferent disturbance ( vertigo ) due to the sudden upset of functional equilibrium is its immediate cause . ( b ) The rotation phenomenon and the forced movements and // positions in general which follow immediately on the cerebellar lesions ( whether they are regarded as effects of irritation of the fibres of the peduncles and of the extra-cerebellar cells with which those are connected , or whether they are referred to the paralysis or disturbance of cerebellar functions by the lesion ) must not be regarded either as the converse , or as an exaggeration , of the defect phenomena that appear in the second post-operative period . That vertigo is the true cause of forced movements and , generally speaking , of the dynamic phenomena of the first postoperative period is directly confirmed by clinical cases of cerebellar disease , in which vertigo is a very frequent symptom . But the indirect evidence afforded by the behaviour of monkeys with lesions of the cerebellum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rotation on their long axis by clutching the surrounding objects with their hands . If set upon the bare ground they support not only their trunk but also their head on it . Further , the fore-limb of the operated side is abducted as far as possible , and the animal remains indefinitely motionless in this position in order to avoid vertigo . The disturbance , produced either by irritation of the peduncular fibres or by the sudden disequilil gyration of the functional activities of the two sides by the sudden paralysis of one , may produce vertigo . On the other hand , we know that independent of any cerebellar lesion similar rotatory vertigo with actual rotation on the longitudinal axis may be produced in dogs , either by section of the vestibular nerve ( Bechterew ) or by a unilateral lesion of the inferior olive ( Probst ) . As the relations of the vestibular nucleus and the olive with the cerebellum are known , it might be assumed that here also the disturbance of cerebellar influence comes into play in producing the rotation phenomenon . But even when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to produce galvanic vertigo in dogs ( Purkinje and Hitzig ) which proves that vertigo may arise without active participation of the cerebellum . There is evidence which tends to show that the rotary phenomena which accompany vertigo depend actually neither on the cerebellum nor on the brain-stem , but solely on the so-called motor zone of the cerebrum . In this connection the symptoms described by Pagano after injections of curare are of great interest . If the motor zone ( sigmoid gyrus ) is excited on the side opposite the cerebellar hemisphere into which curare is injected , no localised movements of this side result , and the rotation of the body round the longitudinal axis occurs in the opposite direction . Complete removal of the motor zone on both sides entirely suppresses both the general convulsions and the partial tonic contractions ; only an increase in muscular tone is perceptible , particularly in the muscles of the injected side . This series of facts shows that the dynamic phenomena of the // early post-operative period are associated with a form of vertigo , and that they are neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defect phenomena of the second post-operative period , because they are not fundamentally due to excessive activity nor to paralysis of the cerebellums . The explanation of the dynamic phenomena of the first period is still a mystery ; it is very doubtful how far they depend on irritation or paralysis of the cerebellar peduncles . It is incontestable , and in our ( ) pinion clearly proved , that it is impossible at present to argue from these phenomena in regard to the normal functions of the cerebellum . If in our 1891 Monograph all these dynamic phenomena of the early post-operative period were referred on the strength of ablation experiments to irritation , on the other hand we avoided the more serious error of assuming them to be the converse of the true phenomena of cerebellar deficiency . Indeed , we have repeatedly noted that phenomena of irritation prevail in the muscles of the fore-limbs and neck , and phenomena of ' deficiency in the muscles of the hind-limbs and vertebral column . IV . As the dynamic phenomena of the first period disappear , the symptoms which depend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prominent . These , as we have already said , constitute the syndrome which is known as cerebellar ataxy . The dog , after removal of ' half its cerebellum and as the early dynamic phenomena are disappearing , is so weak in the muscles of ' the limbs on the operated side , particularly the hind-limbs , that at first sight they appear paralysed . In order to move from one place to any other , it is obliged to crawl on the buttock of the operated side , the principal effort being made with the muscles of ' the healthy side . This inability to stand upright and walk may last four weeks . During this time , however , if the animal can lean the flank of the operated side against a wall , it is able to stand upright and make regular steps . Further , if thrown into water , it keeps itself quite well on the surface , maintains its equilibrium , and swims with perfect co-ordination . But if its method of swimming be carefully watched , it is seen that it can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lies constantly deeper in the water than the normal side . Moreover , the animal is unable to swim in a straight line , and constantly makes circus movements to the sound side . The interpretation of these facts is obvious . The animal is incapable of standing on its feet and walking unless it can find support on the operated side , because the weakness of the limbs on that side is so great that they can not bear the weight of its body . It succeeds in swimming well , because the water supports the weight of the body . In swimming , its healthy side is higher , and it continually turns towards this side , because the move438 PHYSIOLOGY CHAP . ments and the thrusts in the water with the limbs of the healthy side are more vigorous and energetic than those on the operated side . The animal gradually learns to make more and more successful efforts at standing upright and walking , till at last it succeeds . At first it falls constantly to the side of the operation , owing to the giving way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // equilibrium ; after a time it falls less frequently . This gradual restitution of function is only to a small extent due to organic compensation , and depends far more upon functional compensation , on the gradual acquisition of new acts and movements , which are capable of compensating the effi , cts of cerebellar deficiency , and of preventing loss of equilibrium and the tendency to fall towards the injured side . By the curving of the vertebral column the weight of the hind part of the body is thrown towards the affected side , and thus falls chiefly on the opposite hind-limb , i.e. the hindlimb unaffected by the operation . By abduction of the fore-limb it widens the basis on which the body rests , lowers its centre of gravity , and makes the passive flexion of the fore-limbs in the various joints more difficult . Reproduction of the footprints gives a record of these compensating processes and a more minute analysis of the gait . The normal tracing of the dog 's ordinary walk is not always perfectly equal and regular , but varies not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also with its race , as shown in the examples of Fig. 232 . To understand this tracing it must be remembered that the ordinary step of the dog is made by alternate setting down and lifting up the two diagonal pairs of feet , and that both the setting down and the lifting up of the fore-limbs precedes those of ' the hind-limbs , so that four distinct taps occur at regular intervals , as can be proved by listening when the animal walks upon a wooden floor . If we examine the tracing of the footsteps of a hitch in which the right half of the cerebellum had been completely extirpated , it is seen to be very different from the normal ( Fig. 233 ) . Tracing b was taken two months after the operation ; the animal held the principal axis of its body curved to the right and oblique to the direction of progress , so that the limbs of the right side were more raised and abducted ' than in the normal , and the left limbs adducted . It shows this alteration in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right of the footprints of the hind-limbs , the varying length and force of ' the step , and the irregularity of the two lines which join the prints of the fore-paws , which normally are almost parallel . A year after the operation tracing c was taken from the sauce hitch , and showed greater regularity of gait , although the displacement to the right of the footprints of the hind-limbs still persisted , though it is less pronounced . After blindfolding the animal 's eyes tracing d was taken , and shows that the gait was not much altered from that with the eyes open ; but the direction of progress was uncertain , the steps shorter , and the fore-limb more abducted . Tracing e was taken a few minutes after the subcutaneous injection of 30 egrms. of morphine hydrochlor. and shows exaggeration of all the above anomalies in the animal 's gait . // When the dog with half a cerebellum has succeeded , after repeated attempts , in avoiding failing to the injured side by appropriate compensatory acts , it also becomes . able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it is able to keep to a straight line , and to turn towards the operated side . For this purpose it adopts the salve device in swimming as in walking , that is , curvature of the vertebral column towards the defective side , which enables it to use the lumbo-sacral part of its trunk as a rudder . It compensates the stronger action of the limbs of the sound side by an appropriate degree of vertebral curvature , and swims in a straight line or even turns towards the defective side . One of the main results of our studies on the cerebellum is that we have shown it to be possible , and even easy , to separate the phenomena of cerebellar deficiency from the phenomena of // functional compensation , that is , the instinctive and voluntary acts above described , by which the animal tries to repair the effects of loss of cerebellar function . As soon as the so-called motor zone of the cerebrum is destroyed on one or both sides the animal with a half cerebellum loses for a long time , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upright , and walking without falling towards the affected side . When the motor region of the left cerebral hemisphere was removed from the bitch with the half cerebellum which , fourteen months later , gave the tracings in Fig. 233 , she once more lost the power of standing upright and walking , because the limbs of the right side could not support the weight of the body . Twenty days after the cerebral operation she succeeded , by leaning her right side against a tree , in raising herself on her four legs . But as soon as she tried to leave this support she fell . She was , however , able to swim well to the right , and even in a straight line , notwithstanding the curvature of the vertebral column to the right , because the strokes of the left limbs on the water were much stronger than the right . About six months after the last operation she could once more walk without support , but still fell not infrequently to the right . In walking she held the axis of her body very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even more curved to the right than at the time when tracing b was taken . When blindfolded she did not attempt to walk , // and if forced to move , she fell to the right , owing to the limbs of the right side , in which muscular and cutaneous sensibility were altered , giving way . If thrown into water in a pool , she swam properly with eyes open or blindfolded , with well-coordinated movements , but with the right side deeper in the water than the left . She died from severe and repeated epileptic attacks , five months after the second operation . When the brain was removed from the body both lesions were found to be complete ( Fig. 234 , A , B ) . In this case the inability to stand upright and to walk , after ablation of the motor zone on the side opposite that of the cerebellar operation , was not complete and permanent . The partial reeducation of the animal , notwithstanding the marked alteration in motility and sensibility of the right limbs , was undoubtedly due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been left intact . In other cases , in fact , when the animals were deprived of half the cerebellum and both motor zones , we obtained permanent loss , not only of maintaining the erect posture and of walking , but of swimming also . The phenomena of cerebellar deficiency exhibited by the animal with a half cerebellum , particularly in the limbs of the operated side , must be analysed more accurately . Let us again refer to the bitch from which the tracings in Fig. 233 were taken . Prior to the extirpation of the right half of the cerebellum this animal had been trained to sit up for a long time on its hired legs . After the operation it lost this power , and had not regained it fourteen months later . When food was brought to the animal and held above its head , it stood upright , but fell suddenly , owing to the flexion of the right hind-leg . When it was made to draw a weight tied to its tail , the greater expenditure of force required in walking caused it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clamp was applied to the lobe of the left ear the animal tried to remove it by appropriate movements of the left fore-limb ; but if the same clamp was placed on the ear of the side operated on , the animal never attempted to use the limb of that side , but contented itself with vigorously shaking its head , which frequently caused it to lose its balance and fall to the right . To these and other similar phenomena of cerebellar deficiency we gave the name of asthenia : muscular asthenia due to nervous asthenia , the direct consequence of loss of the influence of the homolateral half of the cerebellum . Other phenomena prove that this asthenia is always closely associated with a definite diminution of the normal tone of the muscles ? i.e. of the degree of their active tension during rest which must exert a considerable influence on the contractions and relaxations of the muscles , particularly as regards the form , degree , and duration of these processes . // When the bitch that had lust the right half of its cerebellum was held up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right hindlimb were seen to be more relaxed than those of the opposite side , as in the hind-leg of Brondegeest 's frog , after section of the posterior spinal roots . On lifting the soles of the animal 's feet with the paten of the hand , greater resistance to passive flexion was felt in the leg of the healthy side than on the side operated on ; the latter , indeed , could be flexed beyond the normal limit , that is , farther than the limb of the sound side . If the animal was watched while feeding irl the upright position , with its limbs separated to widen the base of support and its whole attention given to its food , it was noticed repeatedly that the legs of the injured side gradually gave way , so that the animal would have lost its equilibrium and fallen to this side , if it had not become aware of its danger in time to recover its equilibrium by suitable compensatory movements . The tendency of the animal to fall towards the operated side during the early days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the passive flexion of the limbs when it is intent on its food . On watching carefully , it is evident that the fall is due , not to the irregular position of the injured limbs , but to the unexpected relaxation of the muscles , which the animal has not yet learned to guard against . Another more easily observed phenomenon may in our opinion he referred to the too sudden relaxation that follows the contraction of the muscles , owing to diminution of their tone . We noticed in our bitch that the limbs of the operated side were lifted higher than the normal , as if she had to mount up little steps , and that she set them down more forcibly on the ground , and thus made more noise on the wooden floor . It appears to us highly probable that the abnormal elevation is the effect of the too rapid relaxation of the extensors of the limbs during the contraction of the flexors , and the stamp the effect of the too rapid relaxation of the flexors while the extensors contract . We shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less probable interpretations of it . To this group of symptoms , which are intimately connected with and yet distinct from asthenia. , we gave the name of etonia , which has met with general acceptance . A third group of symptoms may be added to asthenia and atouia if the mode in which the contractions are carried out is carefully observed . In normal limbs the contractions of the muscles are gradual and sustained in character , that is without interruption of continuity , without trembling or oscillation , and with perfect fusion of their elementary impulses . When lying down in its kennel the animal , after removal of half its cerebellum , wily differs from the normal animal by a slight and almost eon444 PHYSIOLOGY CHAP . stant trembling of the head , which in this posture is the only unsupported part of the body , its position being maintained by the active contraction of the muscles of the neck . When the animal stands it can be seen that the tremor is not limited to the head , hut involves the whole body , which oscillates slightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When it moves slowly this tremor is exaggerated ; the movements of the limbs on the operated side and of the vertebral column show a characteristic defect in continuity and stability , owing to the intermittent nature of the contractions , as though the summation of single impulses were imperfect . This defective co-ordination and unsteadiness is known to clinicians as titubation , since it gives the impression that the patient hesitates to decide , or has difficulty in transmitting the voluntary impulse to the muscles . This titubation , however , disappears when . the animal spontaneously , or compulsorily , accelerates its gait . No signs of ataxy are then perceptible other than those which depend on , hemiasthenia and hemiatonia , and on the abnormal compensatory acts by which the animal endeavours to escape the effects of these . This proves that the tremulousness does not depend on delay in the development of the voluntary impulses , or on difficulty of transmitting them to the muscles ; but solely on the incomplete summation of the single impulses , owing to which the movements become slightly tremulous . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the character of marked rhythmical oscillations when the animal eats some favourite food . There are also true pendulum movements of the head in the diagonal direction , due to the alternate functional predominance of its depressor and levator muscles , which are partially transmitted over the whole trunk . The animal is unable to check or arrest them , so that its nose may hit the bottom of the dish or the floor oil which the food is placed . To this group of phenomena , which includes tremor , titubation , and rhythmical oscillating movements , we gave the name of astasia. for the sake of brevity and owing to their probable common origin . The ataxy in apes deprived of half their cerebellum is fundamentally identical in its main features . Generally speaking , compensation sets in more rapidly and in a very varied form in these animals . We have already seen that monkeys can overcome the effects of vertigo soon after the operation . On the disappearance of the dynamic disturbances they are almost always able to avoid falling to the affected side ; in walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting upright they support themselves by placing one or both hands to the ground or by holding on to the leg of a table . They can also avoid the swaying of the head and // trunk , which might cause them to fall when the hands are used for eating , by resting the head firmly on the ground or against a wall . But these artifices , which the monkey can use in consequence of the higher development of its motor centres , do not obscure the signs of cerebellar deficiency , which are even more striking than in the dog . The asthenia of the limbs on the injured side is expressed , in addition to the signs already described in dogs , in the less use which the animal makes of them ; when a favourite fruit is offered , the monkey always grasps it with the hand of the sound side . This is not due to paresis of the limbs of the operated side , for when the animal is suspended in the air by a sling round its trunk , and one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is strongly grasped with both hands . By pulling gradually on a dynamometer which is fixed to the sling , while the ape is fastened in this way to the leg of the table , it is possible to measure the force by which the animal holds the table ; also it will be noticed that first the hand of the operated side and then that of the sound side gives way . The atonia is shown by the fact that when the monkey is on all fours on the ground , in the horizontal position , the affected side hangs lower , owing to the defective tone in the muscles of the limbs on that side . Sometimes there is slight ptosis of the upper eyelid of the injured side , and a drawing over of the mouth towards the healthy side , when the animal shows its teeth in biting its food . Finally , the astasia that is expressed in tremor , titillation , and rhythmical oscillation is more marked in the monkey than in the dog . Monkeys show tremor not only of the head , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operated side , whenever these are employed . Patrizi ( 1904 ) , to render the atonia , asthenia , and astasia more distinct , recorded graphically both simple twitches and tetanic contractions of the muscles of the normal and the operated side in dogs , after removal of one-half of the cerebellum . His observations show that muscles deprived of the influence of the cerebellum , and excited , directly or reflexly , with electrical stimuli , in an animal that has been immobilised but not anaesthetised , present curves which differ from those of the normal side , owing to diminution of tone , lower functional energy , more rapid fatigue , and the incomplete fusion of the elementary twitches from which the contraction as a whole results . On anaesthetising the animal to eliminate the normal tone of the muscles the myograms of the limbs on the healthy side resemble those obtained without narcosis from the limbs of the decerebellated side . From these results Patrizi was led to con446 PHYSIOLOGY CHAP . elude that the asthenic and astatic phenomena are intimately connected with the atonic symptoms ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cerebellum . A general fact to which there has been no exception in our numerous experiments on dogs and monkeys is that the phenomena of deficiency consequent on complete unilateral extirpation of the cerebellum are limited exclusively to the neuro-muscular system ; sensation is not disturbed . We more particularly investigated the tactile and muscular sense . On merely touching a normal dog while it is eating , or while its eyes are bandaged , or , better , while it is suspended in the air by means of a sling with the limbs hanging down ( Hitzig 's method ) , it shows by a swift movement of reaction that it has noticed the contact . If the tactile sensibility of the decerebellated dog is tested in the early post-operative period , when the animal is still incapable of standing or walking , the reactions to contact are usually absent in the limbs both of the operated and of the normal side , and there may be no reactions to slight painful sensations of any kind , particularly upon the operated side . But if the examination is repeated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time when the locomotor ataxy is at its maximum , the reactions to contact never fail ; only they occur with a perceptible delay on the operated , as compared with the normal , side . Finally , during the period which may last over a year ? in which the cerebellar ataxy is final and permanent , with no prospect of improvement , the animal reacts to slight contacts with equal promptness on either side . This shows that unilateral removal in the cerebellum does not disturb tactile sensibility . It is more difficult in animals to make any exact investigation of the so-called " muscular sense " ? by means of which we are aware of the position of our limbs , the direction of active and passive movements in the same , and the degree of tension or resistance opposed to muscular contraction , without the aid of tactile sensibility and vision . Of these different forms or qualities of muscular sense , the first , which conveys the sense of the position of the limbs , is easy to examine in dogs . When a normal dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and any one of the four limbs is brought into an unnatural position , e.g. when the dorsal surface of the foot is placed in contact with the table , the limb is brought back instantly to the normal position ; if one of the four legs is left unsupported , by letting it hang over the edge of the table , the animal at once draws it up and puts it back on the table . In the dog after removal of half the cerebellum it is impossible to carry out this experiment successfully while the animal is still unable to stand on its legs , and therefore to react to unaccustomed postures , even , when perfectly aware of them . When it begins to // walk , and the cerebellar ataxy is pronounced , the animal does not always correct the abnormal positions in which its limbs are placed , and when it does there is a certain delay in the limbs of the side operated on , as compared with the normal side . Ducceschi and Sergi drew attention to the fact that during this period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not correct the abnormal postures given to the limbs of the operated side , and sometimes , though more rarely , not even those of the limbs on the healthy side , in which there is no reason to suspect any disturbance of the muscular sense . If , lastly , the Muscle sense is investigated during the long period in which the cerebellar ataxy has become stationary and permanent , anomalous positions of the limbs of the operated , as well as of the sound , side are corrected as in normal dogs . These facts show that absence of the cerebellum is compatible with integrity of the muscle sense . It is evident that the frequent failure to react in the early stage and afterwards has no value as evidence of sensory disturbance ; in this kind of research the maxim that one well-established positive proof is worth more than any number of negative proofs holds good . If the behaviour of a dog in which the cortex of one side of the so-called sensory-motor area ( sigmoid gyrus ) has been removed is compared with that of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the muscular sense is seriously disturbed in the former and has not perceptibly suffered in the latter is inevitable . In both the defect phenomena disappear in time , but in the former the failure to correct the abnormal postures of the limbs persists for months , while in the latter it disappears entirely as soon as the animal has acquired the power of walking , although extreme ataxia persists . But the most cogent proof of the integrity of the muscular sense in decerebellated dogs is the retention of power , when the animal lies at rest , of scratching the skin of the abdomen , thorax , and neck with one or both hind-feet , with perfect adaptation to the purpose of removing disagreeable stimuli . This is such acommon occurrence that it may altogether escape the careless observer . But this action , on the one hand , necessitates integrity of cutaneous sensibility , and on the other capacity for rightly exciting , directing , measuring , and therefore being aware of muscular contractions ? in a word , integrity of the muscle sense . V. A critical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cerebellum will greatly facilitate our task of analysing the second typical form of cerebellar ataxy ? that which results from bilateral lesions . Speaking generally , the absence of the whole cerebellum produces the same symptoms as the loss of one-half , only they affect both sides , and do not predominate in one alone . This spread of the defect phenomena to both sides produces a // peculiar form of motor ataxy , which has been well described as " drunken gait " ? a name which suggests itself at once to every one who sees an animal attempt to walk for the first time after removal of its cerebellum . A careful analysis of this reeling zigzag gait shows that it results from the same factors which we distinguished in the gait of animals with a half-cerebellum , i.e. from asthenia , atonia , and astasia , and from compensatory processes , which are not , however , limited to one side , but involve both . On the disappearance of the dynamic phenomena of the early post-operative period , the dog remains for a certain time incapable of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own body . At each attempt to get up it falls now on one side and now on the other . Later it begins to rise on the fore-limbs only , because the hind-limbs flex at each attempt to stand up . That this inability of the animal to assume and maintain the upright posture is due solely to asthenia , atonia , and astasia , and not to inability to co-ordinate its movements , nor to deficient equilibrium , is proved by the fact that during this period the animal is able to swim as well as any normal dog . At a later period the animal manages to rise gradually , and to take a few steps , but it frequently falls to one side or the other , owing to the flexion of the limbs , particularly the hind-legs , which are always the weakest . In the upright position it is never still for a moment , and always seeks the support of a wall in its first attempts at walking . It is only later that it gradually learns to walk without support and to fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoids this altogether . This functional restitution is only to a minimal extent due to organic compensation ; it depends fundamentally upon functional compensation . We must carefully examine the form and the effects of these compensatory processes , because it is these that give its most characteristic feature to cerebellar ataxy . These compensatory processes consist mainly in exaggerated abduction of the four limbs in walking . This widens the base of support and lowers the animal 's centre of gravity , making it less liable to fall ; at the salve time the swaying of the body increases , as this is a reaction to the resistance which its feet encounter from the ground ( Fig. 79 , p. 119 ) . The decerebellated animal can not use the muscles of the vertebral column to compensate its symptoms , as they are atonic and asthenic on both sides ; this contributes to the horizontal oscillations and frequent alternating displacements of the animal 's centre of gravity to right and left . The not uncommon crossing of the fore-limbs , so that the right foot is set down to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is undoubtedly a coinpensatory adaptation , intended to obviate the effects of these // exaggerated horizontal oscillations . It can easily be understood that if the animal 's trunk is inclined to the left and the centre of gravity displaced to that side , while the right fore-limb is raised , then , in order to recover equilibrium , the limb must be put down obliquely to the lefts o that it crosses with the leg of this side ; the contrary must take place if while the left leg is raised the trunk is suddenly inclined to time right while the left leg is raised . This interpretation is confirmed by the fact that crossing of the hre-limbs almost always occurs when the animal tries to alter its direction , as shown by the tracings , of the footprints ( Fig. 235 ) . I n this case it curves its cervical spine to the right or left , so that the left fore-limb crosses with the right , or the right fore-limb with the left , to avoid loss of equilibrium and the danger of falling . So that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . III 2 G // displacement of the centre of gravity to one or the other side as it walks , it can recover its equilibrium either by exaggerated abduction or by exaggerated adduction of the fore-leg , proportionate to the degree of displacement and the stage of the step at which it occurs , whether at the moment of dropping or raising one or the other fore-limb . The gait of the drunken man , at least in mild intoxication , also results fi ? oin depression of the energy and tone of the nervous system ( Scliuiiedeberg , Runge ) ; by facilitating the flexion of the limbs under the weight of the body this produces abnormal involuntary lateral displacements of the centre of gravity , which the individual compensates by exaggerated abduction or adduction of the limbs . The movements of the decerebellated dog are not indeed the best adapted to the object of preserving equilibrium and recovering it when menaced , with a minimal expenditure of energy . We have seen that the animal with half a cerebellum lifts the limbs of the injured side , particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more firmly on the ground . This peculiarity , to which we gave the name of motor dusmetria , and which is well described by the term " hen 's gait , " is seen on both sides in dogs after removal of the cerebellum . Whatever the explanation of this dysmetria , it undoubtedly expresses an imperfect functioning of the peripheral organs whose task it is to effect compensation , so that the animal wastes part of its energy uselessly . We have already shown how this may be interpreted as the simple effect of atony of the leg-muscles , owing to which there is a too rapid relaxation of the extensors when the flexors are contracting and a too rapid relaxation of the flexors while the extensors are contracting . So long as this hypothesis has not been experimentally disproved , we can not include dysnaetria in the fundamental elementary symptoms of cerebellar deficiency which consist in atonia , asthenia , and aslasia . But we shall return later on to this disputed point . The cerebellar ataxy of monkeys which have lost both sides of their cerebellum only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the compensatory processes , owing to their greater activity . During the period in which the monkeys are unable to stand upright , and are compelled by the functional incapacity of their hind-limbs to drag the body along the ground , they can clamber on to the furniture by means of their fore-limbs , which are always less asthenic than the hind . Even long after the operation the monkey is incapable of standing erect and of walking iii the vertical position on its hind-legs only , as it not infrequently does under normal conditions . Again , the dorsal curvature of the back , due to atony of the extensor muscles of the vertebral column , is more pronounced // in monkeys than in dogs , so that in ' the tracing the footprints of the hind-limbs always fall in front of those of the fore-limbs ( Fig. 236 ) . The animal deviates from side to side in walking , making an undulating line , and if it falls to right or left this is always due to the giving way of one or both hind-limbs , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monkey , it moves more slowly , and from time to time feels obliged to rest , sitting on its buttocks . The astasia is most prominent in the neck , but spreads more or less to all the other muscles , as shown by the slight trembling of the limbs each time they are used for isolated movements , as to carry fruit to the mouth , to catch the insects in the hair , etc . In monkeys , too , the limbs are raised unduly in walking ( dysmetria ) , owing to , disturbed functions of the organs charged with the compensatory processes . This dysmetria is certainly not sensory in origin , because cutaneous and muscular sensibility are not found , with the various methods of investigation which can be employed on animals , to be appreciably disturbed . If total extirpation of the cerebellum is performed on an animal which has previously been deprived of the sigmoid gyri , which contain the senso-motor area , or if , vice versa , these are excised in an animal that has already lost its cerebellum , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only of walking , but even of supporting itself for a few moments in the erect posture . This depends less on the fact that the motor defect phenomena are much greater in this case , because those which depend on the absence of the cerebellum sum up with the others which are due to deficiency of the two cerebral areas , than on the removal of the sigmoid gyri , which disturbs cutaneous and muscular sensibility ; the animal consequently loses the power of compensation by which it widens its base of support to save itself from falling . Between the two extreme typical fumes of cerebellar ataxy described , which are due to the total or almost total absence of half // or the whole of the cerebellum , there are a number of intermediate forms , due to partial and more or less extensive , symmetrical , or asymmetrical lesions of this organ , which can more often be observed because it is much easier to keep alive animals with partial mutilations of the cerebellum . The most important difference between the typical forms of ataxy described above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the former improve but little , and persist throughout the animal 's life , the latter improve progressively until they become latent , i.e. there is a true organic compensation , which gradually makes the various forms of functional compensation superfluous . The . tracings in Fig. 237 were taken from an adult bitch in // which the cerebellum had been divided in the median line by a small knife and a hook , so that a considerable part of the grey matter of the vermis was destroyed . Tracing a represents the animal 's normal gait ; four to five days after the operation tracings b and c were taken , which show marked abduction of both fore- and hind-limbs , in order to widen the base of support , thus making it easier to maintain the equilibrium and avoid falling on one side or the other . The steps are also seen to be shorter in comparison with the normal ; to cover the same distance 10 steps were taken in a , 14 in b , 13 in c . Tracing d was made one month , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the improvement in walking is evident and the gait so nearly normal that no one could distinguish it without comparing the tracings . In another bitch we excised the whole of the median lobe or vermis , without , however , exposing the floor of the fourth ventricle , as the uvula was left partly uninjured . Tracing b of Fig. 238 , taken ten days after the operation , when the dynamic phenomena had not entirely ceased , shows very grave locomotor disturbances ; the steps are extremely short and it was found on listening that the taps of the feet on the floor occurred at irregular intervals ; each fore-leg frequently crosses that of the opposite side , but the hind-limbs do not cross . Owing to the strong lateral oscillations of the vertebral column the direction of progression is curved , and often a zigzag , and the distance between the print of each lateral pair of feet varies , which produces a marked disturbance of co-ordination . Two days later , when the dynamic disturbances had disappeared , tracing c was taken , which shows a surprising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ d , which differs little or not at all from the normal . Tracing d ' with the animal blindfolded was obtained on the same day , and shows how little influence vision has upon the gait . A month later the gait is approximately the same , as shown by tracing e . Tracing e ' , obtained after a hypodermic injection of morphia , shows that its action upon the nervous centres causes the partial reappearance of the ataxic phenomena . All our researches lead to the important conclusion that organic compensation of partial lesions is dependent on the remaining ( portions of the cerebellum , i.e. on parts with the same functional character as the part extirpated , and that compensation ensues so much the faster and to a greater extent , in proportion as the part destroyed is small in comparison with the portions left intact and able to function . A valuable confirmation of this analysis of the ataxy due to more or less complete extirpation of the cerebellum in dogs was given by Langelaan ( 1907 ) in his admirable description of a case of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examined // by physiological tests during life and with histological methods after its death . While alive the animal exhibited all the defect phenomena which we described under the heads of asthenia , atonia , and astasia , particularly in its hind-limbs . These defect phenomena were associated with compensatory phenomena , as pronounced abduction of the fore- and hind-limbs . Langelaan carefully examined sensation without discovering any disorder ; the muscle-sense , which he tested minutely , was almost normal . At the post-mortem examination he observed a marked atrophy of the whole cerebellum , which involved only the cortical elements ( granular layer and layer of Purkinje 's cells ) ; while the central nuclei and those of Deiters and Bechterew were normal in form and structure . In addition to the atrophy of the cerebellar cortex // there was an associated atrophy of certain systems of fibres of the cord and bulb . VI . As long ago as 1879 Nothnagel pointed out that the symptoms of disease of no other part of the brain are so uncertain as in the ' cerebellum . Even to-day loose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any general conception of the functions of the cerebellum difficult . The reasons for this failure of clinical and experimental observations to agree are numerous , and must be understood by the physiologist who wishes to avail himself of clinical observation . In the first place , the material for clinical observation of diseases of the cerebellum is not plentiful . In 1899 Adler published a brief review of 124 of the best observed cases from the literature of the ten years preceding . To this survey we need only add the few cases published between 1898 and the present day . In these statistics cases of tumours of various kinds predominate largely over all other forms of disease ; atrophy and agenesia are less frequent ; still less common , haemarrrhagic foci , softening , abscesses ; rarest of all , traumatic and surgical lesions . A highly important fact which impresses every one who studies clinical cases of cerebellar diseases is that in some of them the disease remains obscure or latent during life and is not suspected before the post-mortem examination . Our Monograph of 1891 showed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so only to the extent that the accentuated form of dysmetria of movements which many of the older and some of the modern clinicians hold erroneously to be the most characteristic sign of cerebellar disease , and which are fallaciously termed " disturbances of co-ordination " were wanting . But in other cases there could he no doubt tbat the lesions of the cerebellum presented no syunptouns. if these cases of comparative or total absence of the essential phenomena of cerebellar deficiency are investigated one by one , it will be found that they are all instances of agenesia , viz. a more or less complete congenital defect or arrested development of the organ , dating back to embryonic life , or of sclerosis or atrophy , which are the final outcome of circumscribed encephalitis with a slow course . Mingazzini has recently made a fresh investigation of all the earlier and recent cases of agenesia and atrophy of either half or the whole of the cerebellum , and came to the following con-clusions ( a ) Agenesia of half the cerebellum usually runs its course without any symptoms whatsoever . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only the superficial cortex is affected . // ( c ) When the unilateral atrophy involves the cortex of the involuted folia , but not the deeper parts , slight and not very characteristic motor disturbances result ; there is merely slow progression and a tendency to make backward steps . ( d ) Only when the atrophy involves the whole of one-half of the cerebellum is the characteristic drunken gait and manifest asthenia of the muscles on the affected side to be seen . ( e ) Incomplete bilateral agenesia of the cerebellum seldom runs its course without symptoms . This , however , occurred in a case described by Ingels , in which the weight of the cerebellum was reduced to ; ' ? of the normal . But in the majority of cases there is ataxia with a greater degree of astasia , or pronounced ataxia ? particularly in the lower limbs ? with general asthenia and astasia , which may appear in the hands and arms in the form of tremor . ( f ) In bilateral sclerotic atrophy the main symptoms of cerebellar deficiency are seldom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upright position ( astasia ) , which compels the patient to widen his base of support to avoid billing ; a zigzag gait like that of a drunken man , which is sometimes accompanied by marked diminution of power ( asthenia ) in the lower limbs ? rarely in the upper so that the patient is obliged to support himself by the walls , seats , or a friendly arm to avoid falling . These facts , derived from a critical examination of this group of clinical cases ? which is certainly the most important from the physiological point of view ? not only agree with those obtained experimentally by ourselves in dogs and monkeys , but are a useful complement to them . The cases of agenesia that run a latent course seem to us of the highest value , because they show that if a partial arrest of development takes place in the cerebellum , such organic adaptations may come about in the cerebral system as a whole as can wholly or partially compensate the cerebellar deficiency . The cases of atrophy which present no symptoms during life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agree perfectly with the experimental fact that more or less complete organic compensations may occur with surprising rapidity after incomplete mutilations , symmetrical or asymmetrical , of the cerebellum in dogs and monkeys . Evidently when cerebellar disease develops very slowly , it may attain a considerable severity without any visible symptoms , since the effects of deficiency are obscured or repaired by simultaneous organic compensation in proportion as they make their appearance . It is also plain that the process of organic compensation by the intact parts of the cerebellum can only take place : imperfectly in eases of bilateral agenesia or atrophy , when the healthy and functioning part of the organ is reduced to a minimum . // Less convincing from the physiologist 's point of view is the larger group of clinical eases of various kinds of tumours in one or other part of the cerebellum , which , in addition to more or less extensive destruction of normal tissue , compress the adjacent organs , beyond the limits of actual disease , particularly the pons and medulla . It is a priori evident that in these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to some extent replaced , by irritation or paralytic phenomena , in proportion with the more or less acute course of the disease and the extent and degree of the compression exerted by the tumour on the surrounding parts . The mechanical effects of compression are easy to recognise . The crossed hemiplegia and hemiparesis ' seen in certain cases of tumour of one lateral half of the cerebellum certainly depend on the compression which the tumour exerts on the motor paths in the pyramidal fibres of the same side before they cross . The homolateral paralysis of one or more cerebral nerves by which the syndrome of cerebellar tumours is sometimes complicated is due to the same cause . The symptoms which physicians regard , not without reason , as the irritative effects of cerebellar tumours are more frequent , more numerous , and more varied . One of the most general is intermittent or continuous headache , which may be localised in the forehead or temples , more often in the occiput , particularly close to that part of the cerebellum which is the seat of the tumour . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clinical picture of cerebellar tumours is frequently complicated . Some regard it as an essential feature of cerebellar diseases ; the characteristic syndrome of ataxy would thus be only an effect of vertigo . We learn , however , from clinical observation ? which is in this case of the utmost value since it relates to a subjective phenomenon ? that ataxy may be present without the faintest ' sign of vertigo ; that this is almost invariably associated with irritative and compressive lesions of the cerebellum , and is absent in all degenerative and destructive lesions ; finally , that vertigo is not an exclusive symptom of cerebellar diseases , but is very frequently associated with diseases of other parts of the central and peripheral nervous systems . Vomiting is not uncommonly associated with headache and vertigo , and may depend on the compression of the bulb or on the irritation which spreads to the posterior corpora quadrigemina , where there is a centre for the contractions of the stomach . The forced movements and attitudes by which vertigo is constantly accompanied in animals have usually been observed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cerebellar hemisphere . Rotation and circus movements are // exceedingly rare ; more frequently there is an irresistible tendency to incline sideways or backwards , with curvature of trunk or neck , strabismus , nystagmus , etc. , so that the patient is incapable not only of walking , but also of holding himself upright . Cases of cerebellar tumours are not infrequently complicated by epileptiform attacks , which may be general and widespread , as in ordinary epilepsy , or partial and limited to certain groups of muscles , as in Jacksonian epilepsy . But in cerebellar atrophy of long standing these epileptiform fits are even more frequent ; epilepsy can not therefore be purely and simply the effect of compression exerted 1 ) y the tumours . In tumours with a rapid course this complex of symptoms predominates , and partly or wholly masks the fundamental phenomena of cerebellar deficiency . But in most cases the asthenic , atonic , and astatic symptoms described in animals that have lost part or the whole of the cerebellum are associated to a greater or less degree with symptoms due to compression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cases of agenesia and partial atrophy with a slow course which may remain entirely latent , the gait in the vast majority of cases of cerebellar disease due to large or small , symmetrical or asymmetrical lesions ( tumours , haemorrhagic foci , abscesses , etc. ) is what clinicians term staggering , uncertain , and reeling like that of the slightly inebriated ? this is the synthetic expression of cerebellar ataxy . As in a drunken person , the oscillations of the body and continual irregular displacements of the centre of gravity represent the effects of functional deficiency , while the separation of the feet in walking , the inclination to left or right , the hurried step forward or stumble back , and the use of the arms as a counterpoise , are compensatory acts intended to widen the base of support , lower the centre of gravity , and re-establish equilibrium which is threatened in one direction or the other . In asymmetrical or unilateral lesions of the cerebellum the tendency to fall is in the majority of cases towards the side of the lesion ( seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symmetrical lesions the tendency is usually to fall backwards . Exceptions to this rule , while conflicting from the clinical point of view , have no scientific value . One important clinical result is that the motor disturbances in cerebellar patients are always far more marked in the lower limbs than in the upper ? as is the case to a marked extent in animals . In rare cases there is a certain amount of ataxia in the upper limbs , which is shown in an incapacity for carrying out delicate movements with the hands . Still more important is the fact clinically noted by Nothnagel , Monakow , and others that in cerebellar patients the ataxy of the lower limbs disappears completely when the patients are lying in // bed . In this position of stable equilibrium they are capable of carrying out any movement rapidly and completely . It is rare to find that one or the other leg , if raised , trembles slightly or makes shaky or disconnected movements . " When the patient lies on his back in bed , " writes Nothnagel , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a clear idea of their position and manages to place one limb actively in exactly the same place to which the other has been brought passively . " This , which agrees perfectly with experimental observations , proves that cerebellar patients ? like decerebellated animals ? retain on the one hand the complete ability to co-ordinate their movements , on the other the integrity of the muscular sense , that is , full consciousness of the position of the limbs in space , both during rest and in muscular activity . It is curious to note that while v. Monakow expressly admits that " the phenomena of cerebellar ataxy in man coincide in essentials with the observations made upon animals , " he expressly denies that asthenia and atonia are essential factors in clinical cerebellar ataxy . But it is only necessary to glance through the cases collected by Adler ( 1899 ) , the majority of which were tumours in one or outer part of the cerebellum , to see that asthenia , expressed in the words " weakness " or " paresis " of the muscles of the legs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The most striking are 11 cases of tumour of one cerebellar hemisphere in which muscular weakness , or even a distinct hemiparesis , was noted definitely in the homolateral side . In 6 other cases where there is no reference to the strength of the limbs it is stated that the gait was unsteady and uncertain , and that the patient had a tendency to fall , or did fall , towards the side in which the tumour lay . In 8 cases , lastly , it was noted that the patient was unable to stand or walk , owing merely to irritative phenomena and vertigo . In denying the occurrence of atonia v. Monakow repeated Ferrier 's objection that the tendon-phenomenon or knee-jerk was exaggerated , according to Risien Russell , in animals after operations on the cerebellum . He admits that Gowers , Jackson , and Dercum , on the strength of clinical observations , ascribed a marked influence on muscular tone to the cerebellum . " But , " the adds , " if observations on the absence of patellar reflex where there are circumscribed lesions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cerebellar tumour the tendon reflexes are normal . It is certain that depression of muscular tone involving loss of the patellar reflex is very inconstant in cerebellar affections in man . Luciani assumes that the alteration in tone is so delicate that clinicians do not succeed in detecting it . Ile himself , however ( as Ferrier justly points out ) , has neglected the very method which physicians adopt in every case for testing the tone of the muscles , // viz. examination of the tendon reflex , so that the essential basis of his atonia is wanting . " To this argument we replied to Ferrier in 1896 : " No one has ever demonstrated that the tone of the muscles bears any relation to the reflexes that can be evoked by mechanical stimulation of their tendons . I fail to see why a certain degree of atony should diminish or remove the tendon reflex ; it even seems to me that it may exaggerate this reflex ? if not in force certainly in its range . It is a fact that exaggeration of the knee-jerk or patellar reflex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , apart from the contracture of the paralysed limb . Since Ferrier stated that after removal of the cerebellum the patellar reflex in his monkeys was grossly exaggerated after a few months , he was logically bound to conclude either that the tendon reflexes are in no way related to the muscular tone , or that the absence of the cerebellum , far from producing atonic as I maintain , induces , on the contrary , hypertonia or exaggeration of muscular tone . " Ferrier , and later v. Monakow , did not dispute the facts on which we founded the theory of astasia . He agreed with us that the lack of stability or firmness in the limb , both in different positions and in movement , is seen particularly on the side of the lesion ; that it is not confined to the muscles of the trunk and limbs , but extends to all the muscles ; and lastly , that it is expressed in tremor , unsteadiness , and also in dysmetria of the movements of the limbs , despite the functional compensation of which the voluntary motor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in the simplest and most typical cases the clinical symptoms of diseases of the cerebellum in no way contradict the experimental observations . When the principal atonic , asthenie , and astatic symptoms of cerebellar deficiency are absent or indefinite , it should be remembered that the partial deficiency of the organ may be more or less perfectly adjusted by a process of organic compensation . In cases in which the cerebellar disease runs an acute course , and is accompanied by vertigo and irritative phenomena , these naturally predominate , and may disturb the co-ordination of movements so much as to render the erect posture and locomotion impossible . // VII . The hypotheses of the functions of the cerebellum have developed in three different directions . The first incorrect ideas of Rolando ( 1809 ? 28 ) were modified by Luys , Dalton , and Weir-Mitchell , and aft- our own prolonged experimental studies assumed a definite form , in which the cerebellum is regarded as an organ of subconscious sensation , which exerts a continuous reinforcing action upon the other nervous centres , and on which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the experiments of Flourens ( 1842 ) , who localised in the cerebellum the faculty of co-ordinating the movements of posture and locomotion , was most fully set forth by Lussana ( 1862 ) , who considered the cerebellum as the centre of muscular sense . Lastly , according to the hypothesis propounded by Magendie ( 1825 ) solely on the strength of the forced movements of rotation and retropulsion after lateral lesions or symmetrical destruction of the cerebellar substance , the cerebellum is an organ for maintaining the equilibrium of the body in the erect posture and in walking . This hypothesis was further developed in the work of Ferrier ( 1876 ) , hecluterew ( 1884-96 ) , Thomas ( 1897 ) , Stefani ( 1887 ? 1903 ) , and others , who promulgated various conceptions of the intervention of the cerebellum in the equilibration and orientation of the body in space . Investigation of this last theory is especially important , because it leads to the discussion of the physiological relations between the cerebellum and the labyrinth , the peripheral sense-organ served by the vestibular nerve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cerebellum by means of the nucleus of Deiters . This is not the place to discuss the complex physiological doctrine of the end-organs of ' the vestibular nerve , or labyrinth , which must be dealt with along with the other sense-organs . It has been experimentally demonstrated that the nerve-endings of the semicircular canals and saccules of the vestibulum constitute an extremely delicate organ of sense , necessary to the preservation of equilibrium and the orientation of the body in space . Here we need only insist on the fact which is of predominant importance for the physiology of the cerebellum , that the proximal and remote phenomena consequent on unilateral and bilateral destruction of the labyrinth resemble in no slight degree those which appear after the unilateral or bilateral ablation of the cerebellum . Flourens , who was the first to propound a theory of the function of ' the labyrinth ( 1824 ? 30 ) , recognised the analogy between the motor disorders consequent on lesions of the semicircular ealmals and those which follow cerebellar ablations . The further investigations of ' Goltz ( 1869 ? 79 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two operations . Lastly , Ewald ( 1887 , 1889 ? 92 ) , who investigated the more remote residual phenomena due to uni- and bi-lateral ablation of the labyrinth , // brought out clearly the almost complete identity of these with the fundamental phenomena of cerebellar deficiency . We must confine ourselves to stating that the main symptoms due to defect of the labyrinth are ? according to the minute observations of Ewald ? abnormal relaxation of the affected muscles , diminished energy ( luring activity , and diminished precision of the movements in which they are concerned . All the special symptoms which animals without a labyrinth present in comparison with normal animals can easily be interpreted as the effects of atonia ( luring repose , and of asthenia and astasia during muscular activity . The symptoms of the early post-operative period are also phenomena of deficiency , as recognised by Flourens , and are accordingly of the same character as the residuary symptoms of the later period . This appears from Ewald 's work , and still more obviously from the researches of Gaglio ( 1889 ) on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cocaine is applied to the divided semicircular canals all the motor disturbances consequent on the lesions persist , while if the canals are intact it produces for a period of thirty to sixty minutes the same effects as result from cutting or destroying them . The difference in the motor disturbances in animals a short time and a longer period after loss of the labyrinth is only quantitative , and is due to the intervention of compensating phenomena . Ewald showed that after almost total disappearance the motor disorders consequent on destruction of the labyrinth reappeared after removing the motor zone of one cerebral hemisphere , and return in their original intensity and persist after removing both motor regions , so that the parallel is almost complete between our studies on the cerebellum and those of Ewald on the labyrinth . The fact that the motor disorders produced by destruction of the labyrinth are phenomena of deficiency led Ewald to conclude that these peripheral sense-organs normally send a continuous excitation to the nerve-centres , which reaches the muscles reflexly , keeps up their tone , and thus makes their normal function @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflexly keeps up muscular tone ? Owing to the great resemblance between the phenomena of labyrinthine and cerebellar deficiency , it seems legitimate to conclude that the labyrinth exerts its tonic action on muscle through the cerebellum . Ewald , however , is not in favour of this conclusion , on the strength more particularly of the experiments of his pupil Lange , who demonstrated that in pigeons which had been deprived of their cerebellum some time previously lesions of the labyrinth induced the same characteristic phenomena as were observed when the cerebellum was intact , // and that iii pigeons which had some time previously lost their labyrinth the removal of the cerebellum was followed by incapability of standing , and all other disorders noted when this operation is performed on the normal pigeon . But in a later critical study ( 1.903 ) Stefani rightly points out that ii ' the phenomena of labyrinthine deficiency can be evoked on decerebellated animals , this only shows that this sensory organ influences not merely the cerebellum , but other centres also ; and if the phenomena of cerebellar deficiency appear in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activity is maintained not merely by the impulses coming from the labyrinth , but also by those other multiple afferent paths which anatomy has shown to be directly or indirectly in relation with the cerebullum . In order to bring out the special physiological importance of the vestibular nerve , in so far as it is related to the cerebellum and concerned in its functions , Stefani refers to his earlier experiments with Weiss ( 1877 ) , which showed degenerative alteration of Burk-in je 's cells-in the cerebellum of ' pigeons after destruction of the semicircular canals . Since this result was not confirmed . by other observers , Stefani ( 1899 ) induced his pupil Deganello to repeat these experiments with the methods of Marchi and Nissl . These new researches not only confirmed the preceding results , but brought out other degenerative changes in the bulb , which are highly interesting for both anatomy and physiology . Since Purkinje 's cells are the principal element of ' the cerebellar cortex , a localised degeneration round these in all the lamellae , on one or both sides , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Stefani and Deganello ) , can only mean that the activity of the cerebellum is due mainly , if ' not exclusively , to the impulses transmitted front the labyrinth . While fully agreeing with Stefani 's facts , we are unable to subscribe to the theory which regards the cerebellum as the organ for equilibration and orientation of ' the body in relation to its enviromnent . Neither the cerebellum nor the labyrinth , hi so far as it is in relation with the cerebellum and influences its activity , has this special function , though undoubtedly both combine with other centres to preserve equilibrium and orientate the body in space . Ewald , who is the most competent authority on the physiology of ' the labyrinth , expressly admits that the continuous reflex action of the labyrinth on muscular energy and tone is the man function of this organ , and that in virtue of ' this reinforcing action ( which nay oscillate more or less according to the displacement of the centre of gravity of ' the body ) the labyrinth participates in the complex functions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labyrinth to he the organ for perception of the position of ' the head , and fundamentally important to // equilibrium , and he considered the motor disturbances which follow lesions of the semicircular canals to be the effect of defective or fallacious sensations of the position of the head , due to suppression or alteration of the normal displacements and oscillations of the pressure of the endolymph iii the semicircular canals , by which the ampullar nerve-endings are excited . It was , however , demonstrated by Cyon ( 1897 ) and confirmed by Gaglio that under certain experimental conditions the endolymph may be entirely drained away without producing any disturbance of equilibrium . At the same time Cyon 's hypothesis that the semicircular canals are the peripheral organ of space-perception is unproved , as will be shown in Chapter II . of the next volume . As Gaglio aptly observes , " We explore space with all our senses , and it is the sum of ' the impressions which they make on our nerve-centres that arouses in us the consciousness of ' relation , of the position of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our body in respect to the environment . " The principal function of the labyrinth is ? in Ewald 's expression , already used by Hogyes ? its tone , by which muscular tone is reflexly controlled ; and no other hypothesis is needed to explain the motor disorders consequent on section or destruction of ' the semicircular canals . The disturbance of the muscular functions is so prominent that Ewald and many others before and after him have called attention to it , and , as Gaglio remarks , it is this which has led the observer so far from the truth . If we examine the theories of the physiology of the cerebellum we find the same fallacy . Abstract ideas of equilibration , orientation , co-ordination , for a long while prevented attention from being directed to the essential phenomena . In 1886 Ferrier , starting from the fact that the activity of the cerebellum persists intact after removal of the cerebral hemispheres , declared that organ to be independent of consciousness and will , although he held it to be normally associated with the activity of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will under normal conditions provoke conscious or voluntary efforts of ' a compensatory character in the opposite direction . The same adjustments effected by the cerebellum may therefore be carried out by the fore-brain independently of it . The effects of cerebellar lesions were designated by Ferrier paralysis of reflex adjustments , and are to be carefully distinguished from paralysis of spinal and cerebral reflexes , which never results front uncomplicated cerebellar lesions ; so that in 1886 Ferrier looked on the cerebellum merely as a centre in which a very complex mechanism for ' unconscious equilibration was developed . during phylogenetic evolution . But as the cerebrospinal axis already in itself contains mechanisms which are capable of reacting to each displacement of the equilibrium of the body by appropriate instinctive // or voluntary reflexes of a eouipensatory character , capable of replacing the body in the normal position of equilihriun ! , it is obvious that equilibration of the body in space is not a specific function , attributable to this or that part of the system , but a complex function , dependent on the intimate organisation and functional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that cerebellar ataxy is not due to defective equilibration in space , hut to the astlienic , atonic , and astatic neuromuscular state , is the fact that there is a period or stage of cerebellar ataxy during which the animal is incapable of walking or falls at every step , although it is still quite capable of floating and swimming perfectly in the water ? where equilibration is much more difficult ? without losing its equilibrium , and of regaining it promptly if it is lost , and further of readily altering its direction by appropriate compensatory acts in order to get near the edge of the basin and climb out ( Lueiani ) . In order to discredit this observation , it was suggested that " the movements required in swimming in water are not necessarily so exact as those of walking " ( Murri ) . Obviously the everyday fact has been overlooked that every normal person knows how to walk , while many have never learned to swim and can not keep themselves afloat in water without drowning . The publication of our Monograph , The Cerebellum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Iii reviewing our work ( Neurological Society of London , 1894 ) he no longer spoke of the cerebellum as an organ of equilibration , nor as a collection of unconscious centres of reflex action destined to come into play to restore the equilibrium of the body as soon as it is menaced in any given direction . Iie admitted , on the contrary , that the cerebellum exercises a constant influence ( directly or through the other cerebrospinal centres ) upon the motor systems of the animal machine , adding that " even , however , if we assume that this is the trite formula for the influence of the cerebellum it still remains to be determined how its activity is called into play and brought to bear on the muscles , either in association with the cerebrum or independently . " i In his earlier work Stefan applied Goltz ' theory of the semicircular canals to the cerebellum , and maintained that " the cerebellum may he regarded as an organ which utilises the impulses sent out from the semicircular canals to acquaint the animal with the position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The decerebellated animal is not able to keep its head iii the normal position because it has lost consciousness of its position . When it wants to carry out some movement its head oscillates in all directions and the centre of gravity is displaced to one or the other side , while the animal reacts to these displacements by i Ferrier , Brain , 1894 , vol. xvii. p. 17 . VOL. 11I 2 It // appropriate compensation movements directed to the maintenance of its equilibrium which cause the irregularity of its gait . In a later publication ( 1903 ) Stefan came back on his old theory , and recognised that it was inadequate , and that " in the actual state of our knowledge the best hope of completing it lies in blending it with the theory of Lucian , who regards the cerebellum as the centre of muscular tone . Luciani has demonstrated the existence of a cerebellar tone , Ewald the existence of a labyrinthine tone . To complete the two theories and fuse them into one we need only assume that the cerebellar tone , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is therefore adapted to the requirements of equilibration and orientation , as already suggested by Dreyfuss in Germany and Gaglio in Italy . " It is not , however , a matter of indifference whether the cerebellum is termed the organ of equilibrium , or of orientation , or of tone . The tonic reflex activity controlled by the cerebellum is not merely exerted on the muscles that function during posture , and locomotion , but it extends more or less to all the skeletal muscles whatever their function . In moving the eyes , in speaking or singing , in writing , playing the piano , sitting down , in all these actions there must certainly be intervention of the tonic influence of the cerebellum , although the resulting movements are quite different in character from those of equilibration . Again , when standing and walking the cerebellum intervenes less as the organ for preserving equilibrium than as the organ which regulates the tone and contraction of the muscles to the right extent and in the proper combination . Stefani is unfortunate in citing Gaglio in support of his hypothesis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the head possesses a special sense of equilibrium in the labyrinth , " since the general conditions of sensibility which control the sense of equilibrium in other parts of the body must suffice . " VIII . In The Cerebellum ( 1891 ) we made a comparison between the primitive rudimentary theory of Rolando and that of Flourens , and expressed the following opinion , which we still hold to be legitimate : " Rolando looked upon the disturbance of co-ordination as the effect of partial destruction of the cerebellum , owing to which there was unequal and irregular ' transmission of the normal influence of the cerebellum to the different parts , and he erroneously characterised the asthenia as paralysis . Flourens fortunately avoided this error ; he expressly defines as weakness what Rolando termed paralysis , but erred in regarding not this weakness hut the inco-ordination of movements as the main symptom of the loss of the specific function of the cerebellum . In an animal deprived of its cerebellum , he says , toes les niouvements partiels subsistent encore ; la co-ordination seule de ces mouveents est perdue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by more careful observations ; that of Flourens opens a false track to subsequent workers , and has become a serious obstacle to advance in the physiology of the cerebellum . Rolando 's view led him logically to the other error of considering the cerebellum as an organ subservient to sensation ( through the agency of the medulla oblongata ) or to the will ( through the agency of the cerebral hemispheres ) ; the mistake of Flourens led him to create an abstract and fictitious entity , the principle of co-ordination or regulation of complex movements or postures , as represented by the various forms of locomotion or position a principle localised in the cerebellum , and independent of the cerebrum , as the function of the latter remains intact after removal of the cerebral hemispheres . " However fallacious and poorly founded , Rolando 's theory in itself is clear , definite , and complete in fundamentals , while that of Flourens is obscure , imperfect , and unintelligible , since it is impossible to picture in what the supposed co-ordinating or regulating functions of the cerebellum can influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried out by the medullary axis ; nor how this regulation can take place when once the functional independence of the cerebrum and cerebellum has been admitted . " Lussana , who considered the cerebellum as the centre of muscular sense , offered an explanation of the phenomena of cerebellar deficiency described by Flourens that was ingenious in its simplicity . " For a long time " ( he wrote in 1862 ) " the importance of this ( muscular ) sense , through which the muscles effectively carry out their voluntary movements , has been recognised . It will suffice to quote two physiologists of undoubted authority , Bell and Panizza . The former recognises that by sensory impressions we can appreciate the degree of contraction of our muscles , and are able by this means to regulate their activity in proportion to the resistance which we have to overcome . in 1834 Panizza , who described ataxia after section of the dorsal spinal roots , wrote : The influence of the will on the muscles that are partially deprived of sensibility is feeble and uncertain , because they no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The muscular sense " ( adds Lussana ) " is par excellence the main factor in co-ordinating voluntary movement ; its central organ is the cerebellum . Far more important and indispensable than the cutaneous sense , the muscular sense serves in animals to make known the resistance met with , and in voluntary movements to regulate the forces of contraction by which the muscle is able to overcome it . . . . " Without the cerebellum the animal no longer feels the solidity of the earth on which it rests in standing and walking , nor the // resistance of the medium in which it flies or swims ; it does not recognise the impenetrability of the objects which obstruct its course ; it does not feel the weight of the body it has to carry ; this is the physiological explanation of the disturbance of voluntary movement described by Flourens . Le cervelet , ' says this author , est le siege exclusif du principe qui eo-ordonne les movvmments de locomotion . ' The true function of the cerebellum , in short , is the muscular sense . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development of that of Flourens , save for his assumption that the cerebellum is not the seat of any sensation . His hypothesis is so lucid that it might find general acceptance were not one thing ? direct experimental evidence for it ? lacking . As a matter of fact , the occurrence of the staggering and reeling gait , and other locomotor disorder in decerebellated animals or in diseases of the cerebellum is not enough to establish loss or disturbance of muscular sense , because the normal regularity of , the movements does not depend exclusively upon the muscle sense . In 1903 a pupil of Munk ? Lewandowsky ? again assumed the cerebellum to be the centre for muscular sense , and claimed that the phenomena of cerebellar ataxy consist in disorders of co-ordination . As we have already given definite proof that both in animals after removal of the cerebellum and in disease of this organ in man the muscular sense is not in any way altered , it is unnecessary to discuss this hypothesis again . But the position taken up by Lewandowsky may detain us for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not express a unitary concept , but is simply a complex represented by certain disorders of movements , or motor paralysis . " If , " he adds , " a definite concept were attached to the term ataxy , there would be no ground for dispute as to what is meant by cerebellar ataxy . " Again , when we say that the animal or man whose cerebellum is affected has an uncertain , reeling , swaying gait , similar to that of a drunkard , we express , not a single phenomenon , but a complex , which may be split into a number of components . What are the simple components of cerebellar ataxy for Lewandowsky ? He verifies the occurrence of astasia , atonia , and neuro-muscular asthenia , which we have described and demonstrated in various ways . He recognises the atonia by the fact that the limbs of decerebellated animals can be flexed or extended not only more readily than , but also beyond the range of , the normal . He also describes asthenia , but does not admit that it is due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He assumes that the complex movements only appear less energetic because the synergic and co-ordinated actions of all the muscles that come into play in the various voluntary moveviii THE // nients are lacking in decerebellated animals ; in a word , asthenia is for him a result of disturbance of the co-ordination of the movements . As evidence for this loss of co-ordination Lewandowsky adduces the phenomenon which we described minutely under the name of dysmetria , as expressed in the so-called hen 's gait . Lewandowsky regards this symptom , which can also be seen after section of the dorsal spinal roots and in tabes dorselis , as allimportant . Asthenia , atonia , ataxia , fall into the second place ; they are not fundamental phenomena of cerebellar ataxy , hut are merely secondary to dysmetria and to the imperfect coordination of the voluntary movements , which in its turn is due to disturbance of the muscular sense ! " Luciani , " he adds , " has not been able to clear up the symptoms in cerebellar ataxy , because he overlooks one effect of cerebellar lesions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the muscular sense . While Lucian , after thousands of experiments , has never observed disturbances of the muscle sense , we , on the contrary , say that every motor trouble due to cerebellar lesions is accompanied by it . " This view , which is denied by most authoritative observers , compels Lewandowsky to admit : ( a ) That the cerebellum is not the only central organ of muscular sense , as the cerebral cortex also participates ( b ) That it does not represent an intermediate station on the baths of muscular sensibility running to the brain , but that there are direct paths between the cerebrum and the spinal cord , which ; ire unconnected with the cerebellum ; ( c ) That there is both conscious and subconscious regulation of movement by the muscular sense ; that the cerebrum attends to conscious regulation , while the cerebellum has no other task than that of controlling and directing the subconscious move-ments But these conclusions invalidate all his previous statements : if the cerebellum is not the seat of conscious sensations , cerebellar ataxy obviously can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after section of the roots and in tribes , nor is the cerebellum a centre for the muscle sense . If the spino-cerebral sensory paths are unconnected with the afferent spino-cerebellar paths , it is clear that decerebellated animals can not exhibit disturbance of the muscle sense , since the spino-cerebral paths that transmit the impressions of the state of the muscles to the cerebral centre are intact ; it is accordingly absurd to assume that the decerebellated animal does not perceive and correct abnormal positions of its limbs , if it be once admitted that the cerebellum is not the scat of conscious sensations . It must be admitted that dysmetria of movement can be // variously interpreted . In 1883 Schiff considered it to he one of the essential elements which , along with asthenia , snake up the syndrome of cerebellar ataxy . But he rejected the hypothesis that dysmetria depends on defective co-ordination , as Lewandowsky holds , nor did he regard it as an effect of the loss of the inhibitory action of the cerebellum , as assumed by Budge in 1841 and by Wagner in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action transmitted from the remaining portion of the cerebellum to the group of muscles which come into play in the different complex voluntary actions . Babiuski , who accepted this , called it cerebellar a-synergy . Schiff 's ' view seems acceptable in cases of incomplete extirpation or pathological states of the cerebellum , but in cases of complete extirpation of one lateral half , or of the whole cerebellum , his interpretation is not adequate . It must further be added that dysmetria is not constant in all cases of cerebellar lesion ; even in clinical cases it is a rare symptom . As already stated , it is probably due to atonia of the muscles of the limbs , owing to which there is a too rapid relaxation of the extensors when the flexors contract , and a too rapid relaxation of the flexors when the extensors contract . Lewandowsky did not admit this simple explanation , according to which dysmetria is a natural consequence of atonic .. IX . We must now consider the function of the afferent hapulses that reach the cerebellum from the numerous afferent paths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efferent paths . These are the main , problems on the solution of which the physiology of the cerebellum has to rest . One of the most striking and really fundamental facts bearing on these problems , which finds confirmation both in physiological experiment and in clinical observations , is that profound alterations and absolute loss of the cerebellum do not paralyse either sensation or volitional movement , although it has been clearly demonstrated that this organ is related by its afferent paths to the peripheral sense-organs ( especially the cutaneous , muscular , and labyrinthine senses ) , and by its efferent paths to the peripheral apparatus for voluntary movements . While lesions of other cerebrospinal centres result in true paralysis ? complete or incomplete ? of sensation and motion , cerebellar deficiency is shown in simple neuro-muscular atonia , asthenia , astasia . In order to explain these differences , we are naturally led to make certain conjectures , which are in no way at variance with anatomical facts , and which harmonise well with physiological research as a whole : ( a ) That the cerebellum with its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so that its removal interrupts no important conducting paths , centripetal ( a // centrifugal , between the brain and the peripheral organs of sensation and motion ; ( b ) That it has no field of action of its own , i.e. belonging to itself exclusively , which is not equally at the service of other centres of the cerebrospinal system ; ( c ) That it is not a sensory centre properly so called , as the sensory impressions which reach it by special afferent paths arouse no conscious sensations , but normally remain subliminal , below the threshold of consciousness ; ( d ) That under the special conditions in which its activity is concerned , it may be regarded as a small coadjutant system to reinforce the great cerebrospinal system . In agreement with the recent morphological and phylogenetic investigations of Bolk , there is ample physiological demonstration that the cerebellum is a single unpaired organ , each portion of which has the same function as the whole . In fact the loss of the vermin may be repaired , i.e. organically compensated , by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or asymmetrical , circumscribed or diffuse , the phenomena of deficiency differ not in their nature and character , but solely in intensity , extent , and duration , and by their more or less marked influence on the muscles of one or other side of the body . Our own investigations proved clearly and decisively that unilateral mutilations have a predominantly homolateral effect , i.e. much more marked on the muscles of the same side , and not only on the muscles that subserve posture and locomotion , but on all the voluntary muscles and in particular on the muscles of the lower or posterior limbs , and on the muscles that fix the vertebral column . If the principal effects of cerebellar deficiency consist in atonia , asthenia , and astasia , iit follows logically that the coadjutant or reinforcing influence that the cerebellum normally exerts upon the rest of the system consists in a tonic , sthenic , and static neuromuscular effect by which ( a ) The degree of tension at which the neuro-muscular organs remain during functional pause or rest is increased ( tonic action ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voluntary , automatic , and reflex actions is increased ( sthenic action ) ; ( c ) The rhythm of the elementary impulses of which these acts are made np is accelerated , and their normal fusion and regular continuity is maintained ( static action ) . If it be once allowed that dysmetria of movement is a constant phenomenon of cerebellar deficiency ; if , as Lewandowsky has maintained , dysmetria is one of its essential and necessary phenomena , and not a simple result of atonia or astasia , then we must add a fourth factor . The tonic , sthenic , static effects must be supplewilted by an adaptive action , on which the range , precision , and // adaptation to end of the several voluntary , automatic , and reflex acts must depend . Gan the cerebellum exert an adjusting effect on the functions of the motor organs without being an organ of conscious sensation ? We need not hesitate to reply to this question in the affirmative , since all the elements of the nervous system , not excluding those of the sympathetic , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wide sense be termed the regulating or co-ordinating faculty ? By what mechanism is this exerted ? Unless we accept with Flourens an abstract co-ordinating or regulating function in the cerebellum , the only alternative is that the precision and accurate range of movement result from the precision and accurate adaptation of its tonic , sthenic , and static influence . The first fact that strikes every one who investigates the intrinsic differences in the three main physiological functions of the cerebellum is that they are so much akin , so intimately connected in their origin , that it is practically impossible to consider them separately and apart . Astasia , in which the deficiency of static action is expressed , is usually held to be a natural effect of asthenia ( Tremitus a debilitate ) ; asthenia , by which the loss of sthenic effect in the activity of the muscles is expressed , appears to be related to the atonia observed during their repose . As , however , it is very difficult to demonstrate the relative degree of the three phenomena in decerebellated animals , and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the most pronounced or obvious symptom in such animals , it may be assumed ? as we said in 1891 ? that there are only three different extrinsic manifestations of a single process , though there may be no constant relation between their relative intensities . In addition to the tonic , sthenic , and static functions , which may collectively be referred to as the " action of reinforcement , " the cerebellum normally exercises a direct or indirect trophic action on the organs with which it is in relation . Direct trophic in/licence is demonstrated by the degeneration and sclerosis that follow ablation of the cerebellum , as shown by the work of Luciani and Marchi , and that of Mingazzini , Turner and Ferrier , Thomas , Probst , and others . Indirect trophic action is seen specially in the muscular changes observed in cerebellar ataxy , the retarded growth of the cutaneous elements , particularly in the skin , and the lowered resistance of decerebellated animals to the injurious action of external agents , so that they succumb to disease more readily than the intact animal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trophic and functional influences obviously represent the two sides ? internal and external ? of one and the same physiological process , the intimate nature of which is unknown to its , and of which we perceive only the most striking and obvious effects . // Both the troplic and the tonic influences are continuously excited by the direct and indirect paths that carry impulses to the cerebellum from the cutaneous , muscular , and labyrinthine sense-organs . Of these afferent paths that serve the activity of the cerebellum , particular importance attaches to the vestibular nerve , which transmits tonic impulses front the labyrinth by way of the nucleus of Deiters , as demonstrated by Ewald , Gaglio , Stefani , and Deganello . It must be abmitted that the demonstration of the special influence which the labyrinth exerts on the functions of the cerebellum is the only new fact of real importance that has been added to the physiology of this organ . X. In conclusion we must recapitulate the new morphological theory of the cerebellum , which Bolk has constructed on the basis of an interesting phylogenetic and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Front the phylogenetie point of view , the cerebellum of all mammals consists of two lobes , one anterior , the other posterior , divided by a primary sulcus . The anterior lobe always forms a single unpaired median organ ; the posterior lobe is subdivided into four lobules , two median and two lateral , which are separated by secondary sulei . From the ontogenetic point of view , Bolk distinguishes four centres of development , two median and two lateral , characterised by varying rapidity of growth , during which the lobular arrangement of the adult cerebellum is determined by means of ' numerous , mainly transverse sulei . On studying the developmental variations of the single lobes or lobules of the cerebellum in different mammals , Polk noted a more or less definite relation between them and the degree of functional development of special groups of muscles ; this led him to attribute the functional control of ' special muscular complexes to certain lobules . We must confine ourselves to the main features of the functional localisations in different lobules of the cerebellum , based on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He starts from the fact that in certain movements the muscles on both sides come into action , and in other parts of the body the muscles of one side are capable of the most complex movements , while those of the other side may remain altogether inactive . The head and neck are certainly included among the former . In the head are the external muscles of the eyes , the masticator muscles , the mimic facial muscles , the lingual , pharyngeal , and laryngeal muscles , which nearly always function bilaterally . In the neck , again , the - muscles that effect the various movements of the head enter into bilateral activity . The muscles of both the // head and neck must , according to Bulk , be influenced by the two separate median segments of the cerebellum . In the upper and lower limbs the case is different . We know that each limb is able in man to execute a great variety of more or less complex movements , independently of the limb on the opposite side . But this independence is not always complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by practice to overcome great difficulties in order to render the muscles of the two sides independent , and to avoid the simultaneous contraction of the homologous muscles of the upper limbs . Bolk infers from this that in order to regulate the movements of the limbs there must be three distinct centres in the cerebellum : one unpaired for synergic bilateral movements ; two paired for the dissociated movements of each limb . Finally the trunk muscles specially employed in the respiratory movements , and iii equilibration during the erect posture and in locomotion , must , according to Boll : , be represented in the cerebellum by one unpaired median , and two lateral centres . Which cerebellar lobes represent these hypothetical centres that can be distinguished , according to Bolk , in the cerebellar cortex ? He begins by pointing out that the lobes and lobules of the cerebellum , as above indicated , are really arranged one above the other , like the corresponding muscular areas of the body . On the basis of this correspondence we may assume that : ( a ) The lobulus anterior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jaw , face , tongue , pharynx , larynx , that is , all the muscles of the head region ; ( b ) The lobulus simplex contains the centre for the muscles of the neck ; ( c ) The upper part of the lobulus medianus posterior represents the median centre for the associated movements of the two extremities ; ( d ) Each of the lobuli ansiformes or paramediani contains the lateral centres for the dissociated movements of the two limbs , the erus primula being more exactly the centre for the fore or upper limbs , the eras secundum and lobulus paramedianus that for the hind or lower limbs ; ( e ) The lower part of the lobulus medianus posterior includes the centres for the respiratory and perineal musculature ; the formatio vermicula.ris the centres for the trunk muscles ; and the lobulus petrosus the centre for the muscles of the tail . This arrangement is represented in Bolk 's diagram of the mammalian cerebellum , which is reproduced in : Fig. 2 : ; 9 . According to Bolk this hypothetical functional localisation in the cerebellum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lobules , respectively , in different mammals with the functional development of the corresponding groups of muscles . // For an exact description of these , the student must refer to Bolk 's original monograph . We shall now see how far . Bolk 's inductions ? founded on comparative anatomy ? have been confirmed by physiological " experiment , either by the method of electrical , mechanical , and chemical stimulation of different parts of the brain , or by the removal of single segments . After Hitzig and Fritsch had demonstrated the possibility of localising certain motor centres in the cerebral cortex by electrical stimulation ( Chap . X. ) Ferrier ( 1879 ) made use of this method , not merely in developing the theory of cerebral localisation , but also in attempting to extend it to the cerebellar cortex . The motor effects which Ferrier obtained by faradisation of various points of the surface of the cerebellum in the ape consisted in associated movements of the eye , ball to the right or left , upward or downward , according as the stimulus was applied to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or posterior part of the median lobe of the cerebellum . Movements of the head , as well as certain abrupt movements of the limbs on the side excited , were often associated with those of the eyes . Ferrier 's results were not , however , confirmed by Mendelsohn with induced currents . Ferrier employed such strong currents that they may have spread to adjacent regions , as the corpora quadrigemina , polls , bulb . Nothnagel ( 1876 ) performed a number of experiments on rabbits with mechanical stimulation , by running a needle into different points of the cerebellar cortex . Among the effects of // this stimulation he noted rhythmical movements of one fore-limb , movements of mastication , arching of back , etc . But these effects were not exactly localised , although Nothnagel affirmed a certain relation between the points at which the needle was inserted and the reaction . Pruss ( 1901 ) attributed much importance to the direction of the currents ( ascending , descending , transverse ) in the results obtained by electrical stimulation of the cerebellar cortex . The conclusions he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important if they could be accepted . But he himself states that the currents which he employed to provoke the reactions described were excessive . Negro and Rosaenda ( 1907 ) repeated these experiments upon the rabbit 's cerebellum with moderate faradic currents . On stimulating the area which corresponded approximately to the crus primum of Bolk , they obtained unilateral contractions of the facial muscles and anterior limb , which were sometimes isolated , sometimes associated . Only when the current was unduly strong did the reactions extend to the muscles of the two sides . With unipolar stimulation they obtained more accurate localisation of the facial and fore-limb muscles , and found that the facial centre lies more forward than the centre for the fore-limb . Both lie somewhat internally , but their exact position was not determined . Horsley and Clarke ( 1908 ) , in a series of researches carried out with more accurate methods , were able to demonstrate that the stimulation had to be of enormously greater strength to obtain motor reactions in faradising the cerebellar cortex than was required to excite the cerebral motor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective when the method of bipolar excitation is employed . They came to the conclusion that the cerebellar cortex is practically inexcitable ; that when motor reactions are obtained , these are due to spread of the stimulus to the subjacent nuclei of grey matter ( dentate nucleus , roof nucleus , Deiters ' nucleus , etc. ) , and , finally , that the results obtained by previous observers were attributable to some fallacy . Pagano ( 1904 ) investigated cerebellar localisation by means of chemical stimuli , and employed minute interstitial injections of a solution of curare , because ? as previously noted by Tillie ? this poison has a decidedly exciting action upon the nerve-centres . He succeeded in mapping out four distinct motor centres in the cerebellum for the muscles of different regions : ( a ) A paired centre for the fore-limb , lying near the crus primum of Bolk. ( b ) A paired centre for the hind-limb , near the crus secunrluni. ( c ) An unpaired centre for the muscles of the neck , lying in the lobulus simplex. // ( d ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the lowest part of the lobulus mediaims posterior . These results approximate closely to Bolk 's diagram of localisation ; but the inadequacy of Pagano 's method for any exact determination of the cerebellar centres may be concluded both from the inconstancy and the variability of the reactions excited by the curare at the different points of injection , and from his own observation that a deep injection of curare into the lobus anterior causes violent excitation of almost all cerebral centres , with varied sensory and motor manifestations termed by Pagano psychic strychninism or motor delirium , which rapidly caused the death of the animal . These studies of the effect of poisons , applied to the cerebellum , were continued in our laboratory by Magnini under Baglioni 's guidance ( 1910 ) . Baglioni 's previous work had proved that local application of weak solutions of carbolic acid affect electively the motor elements of the spinal cord , and solutions of strychnine the sensory elements of the whole nervous system ( p. 264 et seq . ) . It was therefore hoped that by employing these two poisons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cerebellum , it might be possible to obtain facts of importance for the theory of cerebellar localisation . But the results were disappointing , though they brought into prominence symptoms which demi onstrated the specifically different nature from the corresponding elements of the cerebrospinal axis of the afferent and efferent elements of the cerebellum . Carbolic acid , applied to the crus primum and secundum of the cerebellum , in any strength of solution ( 1.3-6 per cent on discs of filter paper ) has no immediate effect . This means that the cerebellar cortex , so far as we know , either contains no motor elements , or these are specifically different in character from the spinal motor elements . Strychnine , when applied to the lobulus medianus posterior , lobulus paramedianus , or eras secundum , either to the surface or by injection , produces no special symptoms , according to the various regions excited , but only more or less general movements of the head , neck , trunk , and limbs of the side homolateral with the stimulation . Application by discs of filter paper either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Superficial injections merely lead to raising of the fore-leg on the same side , blepharospasm , salivation with rhythmical movements of the jaw , tonic contraction of the two limbs on the homolateral side , with tactile hyperaesthesia of the skin of the homolateral side of the face . These results , while they do not disprove the concept of localisation in the cerebellum , give no decisive argument in favour of it . The amount of strychnine used to evoke these phenomena // of excitation ( 1 ? 2 per cent solutions ) far exceeded that required to evoke the typical spasms , when applied to the excitable zones of the cerebral cortex and the dorsal horn of the cord . The more or less diffuse symptoms of irritation are similar to those produced by applying the poison in minute doses to adjacent parts of the bulb . It is probable that the effects observed are due to the spread of the poison to the centres in the dorsal surface of the bulb , and consequently that the afferent elements of the cerebella oe are different in their nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results were obtained by Beck and Bikeles ( 1912 ) on repeating these experiments with superficial application of carbolic acid and strychnine . More exact results in accordance with the theory of cerebellar. localisations were to be expected from the method of partial and localised extirpation of the different segments of the cerebellum . Our studies one the cerebellum aimed specially at formulatinig the general function of this organ on an experimental basis , and were confined to analysis of the components of the ataxy consequent on more or less complete extirpation of one half , or of the so-called vermis , or of the entire cerebellum . " From our researches as a whole , " we wrote in 1891 , " it is plain that the different segments of the cerebellum all have the same function . In fact , the loss of the median lobe may in great measure be repaired , i.e. organically compensated , by the lateral lobes ; and , generally speaking , whatever the cerebellar mutilation , symmetrical or asymmetrical , circumscribed or extensive , the defect phenomena do not differ intrinsically , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their more or less greater incidence on one or other side of the body . . . . We can not , therefore , regard the cerebellum as a collection of functionally distinct or different centres in the sense that each of ' its segments is in more or less intimate or direct relation with a special group of muscles , or is designed for functions of different character . " Nevertheless , our investigations resulted in one definite fact which paves the way to the theory of cerebellar localisation , viz. that in dogs or monkeys the influence of each lateral half of ' the cerebellum is mainly direct , that is , is exerted principally on the muscles of the same side . Rolando 's rudimentary experiments established the same fact , and long before Rolando , in 1749 , the celebrated physician , Giovanni Bianchi of Rimini , had formulated the same theory on a clinical observation , as we learn from Bilancioni 's interesting historical notice ( 1908 ) . Ferrier ( 1876 ) observed a fact which has a certain value in relation to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the extirpation of the anterior portion of the vermis , monkeys showed a tendency to fall forwards ; after extirpation of the // posterior part of the vermis , the tendency was to fall backwards . Thomas ( 1897 ) , on the contrary , found a special relation in dogs between the vermis and the muscles of the anterior portion of the trunk , and between the hemispheres of the cerebellum and the muscles of its posterior portion . But it was van Rynberk who first provided an experimental basis for the theory of cerebellar localisation , taking as his guide Bolk 's work on the comparative anatomy of the mammalian cere-bellum . He attempted to test Bolk 's inductions experimentally by circumscribed extirpations of certain lobules , and to this end performed numerous experiments in the Physiological Institute in Rome ( 1904-8 ) . As all his work was carried out on the dog it is useful in the two accompanying figures to reproduce a diagrams of the dog 's cerebellum divided into lobules according to Bulk ( Fig. 240 ) , as well as a sagittal section , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interlobular sulci , and the varying size of the lamellae of which the lobules are composed ( Fig. 241 ) . The new facts established by an Rynberk may be grouped as follows : ? ( a ) After the total or partial extirpation of the lobulus simplex // the animal presents side-to-side oscillations of the head , which are evidently clue to astasia of the muscles of the neck . Both at rest and vc walking the animal exhibits rhythmical oscillations of the head from one side to the other similar to the sign a man makes for no . This symptom can be observed for a week , or even a month , but owing to organic compensation it becomes less and eventually disappears . ( b ) Immediately after the more or less complete extirpation of the crus primum a characteristic symptom makes its appearance . As the animal lies quiet , or when the trunk is cautiously raised by placing one hand below the thorax , at each mechanical or auditory stimulus the front paw of the side operated on is raised upward and backward to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The paw remains rigid for a moment in that position , and then falls gradually , but the same movement recurs after each stimulus . This obviously dynamic or irritative phenomenon , which recalls the military salute , only lasts three to seven days and gradually disappears . When the animal subsequently begins to walk there is seen to be considerable dysmetria in the movements of the fore-limb , which is due to the atonia of the muscles of the limb , and lasts a longer or shorter time according to the extent and depth of the lesion . But these symptoms , too , disappear owing to organic compensation . ( c ) After the localised extirpation of the crus secondum , particularly when the genii by which this lobule is connected with the lobulus paramedianus is also excised , no dynamic phenomena are ever observed , but only simple asthenia of the muscles of the hindlimb on the same side , owing to which the limb readily flexes under the weight of the trunk . When the extirpation includes the two crura of the lobus ansiformis , there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the two limbs on the side operated on , which becomes less and disappears more slowly by compensation . ( d ) The extirpation of the lobulus paramedianus produces rotation on the longitudinal axis , associated with pleurothotonus to the side operated on . According to van Rynberk these dynamic phenomena , in which the musculature of the trunk plays a special part , are not seen after localised extirpation of the lobus paramedianus . When in addition to this lobule the two crura of the lobus ansiformis are excised , the resulting symptoms strongly resemble those of unilateral removal of the whole cerebellum , but they are more perfectly compensated . ( e ) After the isolated extirpation of the anterior part of the lobulus medianus posterior , which van Rynberk termed lobule S from its configuration , no abnormal symptoms appear . When the crus primum is also extirpated the symptoms which this produces are exaggerated , but eventually they are fully compensated .
