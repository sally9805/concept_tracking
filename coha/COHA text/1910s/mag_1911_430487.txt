 |p756  UNDER a June sun that made saddle leathers curl , two men leaned over the pommels to ease their horses up a little peak in Central Nevada . Moisture dripped from the heaving sides of the animals and formed queer little globules with the powdered rock of the trail . The first rider was a white man , the second a half-breed . Dust and sun had given them a common copper color , and it would have been hard to say at a glance which was which . At the summit their actions distinguished the white from the breed . When they had unknotted the cinches so that the horses might blow to the capacity of their nostrils , the first man spread himself loosely upon the ground with his sombrero tilted to save his face and head from the glare , while the second crouched , as for generations his ancestors had crouched , in a way that afforded the thinnest possible target to the sun , and which yet did not fail to relax those muscles strained by the saddle . For half an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the horses . The white man revived . The sombrero slid to one side as he raised his head and did the thing he had climbed to this perch to do : he looked . Be commanded the whole of Antelope Valley , a sea of desert brush from which the sun and wind had taken toll to the final drop of moisture , with here and there a glistening patch of white alkali . The man searched Antelope Valley with his eyes , a square mile at a time . At length his gaze steadied and did not waver as he unslung a leather case with his fingers and brought a pair of field glasses into play . His eye had caught a procession of dim objects in motion . They might have been tumble weeds at one mile or something else at twenty . The Indian had noted the aiming of the binoculars . The white man turned to him with a grin that cracked the baked dust upon his face . The Indian grunted an affirmative to the other 's unspoken question . " Mustangs ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sighted again , and fell to counting . " One , two , three , four , five -- There were fifteen in the first bunch . They were heading into the sea of brush from the  |p757  opposite shore , single file . The heads held only high enough to clear the ground , told how thirsty they were . Half a mile behind came another mustang . It was the stallion , the big , proud commander of the band , who had put some trusty old mare in the lead of the column while he guarded the back trail and watched ever for the single enemy they had to fear . A little wait and another file of a dozen came into the ken of the watchers . A third column emerged ; finally a fourth . The men leaped up and began to tighten the cinches . They had received their message as plainly as if it had been heliographed across the shimmering expanse . At last the wild horses had given up the search for isolated snow patches in the mountains to the west of the valley and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the east side ? to the springs which were always the last resort because strange traps seemed to start up out of the ground in that vicinity and the man scent would lie strong upon the trails and hidden pools , even though no man might show himself at all . The two scouts swung down from the little peak to carry the word back fifty miles to their employer and his trained crews , who would set in motion all the cunning and elaborate machinery for the summer campaign . A common impression among city dwellers is that the wild horse vanished from the plains of Western America at the heels of the buffalo and in the company of the Indian . In the State of Nevada there are perhaps seventh , thousand live , four-legged reasons for believing that the popular obituary of the wild horse is premature . There are more wild horses in Nevada than there are citizens . But unless you are a vaquero , you might try a year and never get close enough to rope one of the wild prizes or even approach within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and be able to study their ways . From any sheltered lookout you might gaze upon the most plentiful big game that remains to us , for the wild horse is properly and splendidly big game , though the sport consists in capturing him alive for domestic purposes instead of felling him for the pot . Wild horse trapping is today the most perilous trade and the finest sport in the West . It is full of excitements , dangers and big rewards . Most men could not endure the physical strain ; many men who turned to it as a means of livelihood proved that they had not the brains to make it pay . It remained for Charles ( " Pete " ) Barnum , a young ranchman with a college education , to devise and set up in the wilderness a system of wholesale trapping against which equine cunning could work no sure deliverance . And when he had made his capture , Barnum was ready with unique methods of transporting and training his prizes , and in the end he developed a hazardous sport into a trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that has grown and grown .  |p758  The desert of Nevada is by no means limited to the level sagebrush plains . The arid area embraces a great region so upheaved that foothills give way to precipitous mountains and the jagged ranges succeed each other like billows . The trees are weazened scrubs : vegetation is baked brown before it can reach maturity ; chamise , chaparral and sage grow in tangles among the boulders . This is the grazing ground to which the wild horse has been forced in his extremity . The mountains are furrowed by narrow trails that glisten with white dust twelve inches deep . These are the runways of the wild horse as he moves from one feeding place or waterhole to another ten , twenty or fifty miles away . Occasionally the horses wander down into the valleys , making inroads upon planted ground , but the mountains , the very peaks . are their refuge and home . These uncounted thousands of wild horses are ready to become the undisputed property of any man who can put his rope upon them or force them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was made apparent long ago . After hours or ( lays of hard riding a party of vaqueros might rope each his single prize , only to find that the horse that could he taken in this way was seldom worth as much as the trained saddle animal that . had been ruined to make the capture . At times circumstances made roping less difficult , but every ranchman who seriously embarked in the business . forsook it sooner or later in disgust . " Pete " Barnum devised a canvas corral trap which was composed of sections readily portable and which could be moved quickly upon the backs of pack animals , and by setting his trap during the night in hidden places on the trails and by skilful outriding , he found that he could capture wild horses not singly but in bands , securing from six to thirty at one time . When he had learned that the captives could he driven on three legs out of the mountains and to the shipping pens at the railroad , the business began to pay . With several traps and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ships one thousand t o two thousand horses each year . The knowledge , skill and patience required make competitors slow to enter the field . The wild horse does not attain the proportions of a draft animal : he weighs from eight hundred to eleven hundred pounds . The horses move about in hands composed , usually , of eight or a dozen mares and colts led by a stallion extremely jealous of his family rights No other stallion may join the band without first subduing the leader in a bloody fight with teeth and heels . Encounters of this sort are of constant occurrence . Often the fight continues until one of the stallions is dead . The survivor is accepted by the mares as their leader . In fleetness and endurance . these horses are equaled by few horses that take their fodder from a manger . They are of every horse color  |p759  and some are of rare beauty . When captured and broken to harness most of the horses accept the new life readily and make such good work animals that Barnum will never be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not able to catch them or who has all the horses he needs , regards the wild bands as a scourge and he does not fail to try his rifle on the leader whenever a fair shot is offered . Once bands of antelope held the desert and always the leader kept the lookout , enlarging his horizon by mounting to the top of a boulder . To-day the stallion leader keeps the same faithful watch and at the first sign of the coming of man , his neighing sends the herd off at breakneck speed . He lingers to gather as much information as possible and then flies off as the rearguard of his band . When immediate danger seems to have been passed , the stallion will take the place of the old mare who relieved him temporarily and lead the band to safety in some far-off place . Years of shooting and trapping have improved the breed of the wild herds . The weaklings , the scrubs , the laggards ? all but the fleetest of foot and strongest of vitality ? have fallen victims to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pete Barnum . The elimination of the unfit has made the taking of the herds that remain a man 's task . Barnum catches them and finds his task but well begun . Subjugation is as difficult as capture . By his sure methods this trapper moves his captives across a hundred miles of rough country to the railroad where buyers await him ; but he does not sell all of them . The best two in every hundred he sends to his private corral to be broken and trained for use as mounts in the business of capturing others of their kind . Into the reserve go intelligent , crafty , powerful stallions that fought through numberless bloody battles to leadership of the herds . The capture of some rare old leader comes often as the reward of several years of persistent endeavor . Thus it is that when the trapping season is over and the traps have been stored until the deep snows shall have buried the pastures and melted away , there occurs at the Barnum ranch a festival of " busting " such as hardly has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mustang stallion get together for the first time with only the thickness of a saddle between them , represents a period of activity such as may not be measured . The man may , , and often does , come flying from his perch , but he goes up again , and in the end conquers . Occasionally comes a horse that does not yield even after he has sent a vaquero or two to the hospital or the graveyard . He never does yield , and the hate in his heart is stilled only with the stilling of the breath in his wide nostrils . He is the hardest problem of the range ? the outlaw . Experience has shown that the best corral for the busting of wild horses is the same canvas corral in which they are trapped . A wild horse will try to run through a woven wire fence . He may impale himself in trying to clear the poles of a driven palisade . A stretch  |p760  of canvas appearto his inexperienced eyes as impenetrable as the granite walls he has learned to avoid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or when madness has succeeded desperation . When three men enter the corral and take their positions at its center the horses act exactly as so many antelope might if they found themselves hemmed by a fence they could neither leap over nor crawl through . Round and round the mustangs go . climbing upon one another 's backs in their terror . After fifteen minutes of kicking the alkali dust into the air in clouds , the frenzy passes and the time for action arriveAllison , a man of marvelous strength and agility , has coiled his rawhide lariat . He is about to perform a feat such as few men have ever undertaken , though with him it is daily work and pastime . He has tied the end of his fifty-foot lariat around his waist Hard and fast is the knot , for he must rely upon it when the shock come , As a big stallion is about to pass , Allison steps forward . The horse leaps away . Swish ! With masterly precision Allison has placed his loop where the  |p761  stallion can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the honda slides home . The horse feels a rope for the first time in his life . Frantically he bounds off . Allison hurls his iron body backward so that his shoulders seem almost to touch the ground at the instant the stallion reaches the end of the rope . Allison is jerked to an upright position in the same second that the stallion 's feet fly from beneath him and he crashes down upon his side . An amazing trick is this ! The horse scrambles for his feet , but Allison has taken slack and jerks the flashing feet into the air again . A second man leaps astride the stallion 's neck and after a struggle , twists the long head upward and to one side . The forefeet are slashing in spite of Allison 's rope , and the man upon the neck must avoid the hoofs if he would save his life . The long teeth too are brought into play : they could crunch a man 's wrist . In his fury the horse lifts the man 's weight clear of the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relaxes the horse groans his first bitter acknowledgment to his masters . A third @#  |p762  man has put a rope upon one of the hind feet . A hackamore is slipped over the head and drawn tight around the nose , or a snaffle bit is worked into his mouth and the bridle buckled in place . Neither is easily accomplished . No horse opens his teeth to a bit until after he has made the best fight that is in him . At this stage a curb , ring , gag , or spade bit would only cut the tongue without serving any useful purpose . Bring on your saddle . Attach a rope to the cinch ring and work the rope along under the neck and past the shoulder as the horse lies upon the ground . A few jerks and the cinch comes into place . Never mind about a blanket : it will not be needed for the first ride . Throw your weight into the cinching , for you want the rigging to stay when your life is depending upon it . Put the left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he is n't lying upon the right stir rup , slip a foot into that . Take your reins . Get your quirt in hand , but do n't slip your wrist through the loop ; you want to let it go in a hurry . At your command , the men release the horse 's feet with a single jerk upon the ropes . Reach over now and sting the stallion across the nose with the quirt . He struggles to his feet with you in the saddle and for a moment stands bewildered . Now is your chance to get that right stirrup if you have not already caught it , and by a quick movement of the body to settle the saddle squarely upon his back . Gather the slack in your reins , for something is about to happen . A touch of the spur or a flick of the quirt signals the start . His knowledge of what to do must be a heritage from his ancestors , for all horses do it , and all American wild horses are sprung from horses that once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight heavenward . While he and you are high in the air he arches his back and stiffens his body to iron rigidity . Thus he comes back to earth . The sensation to the rider is as if his spinal column had been struck by a pile driver . The impression is not analyzed at the time , for the horse goes into the air again immediately . He swings to right or left , or he " changes ends " completely while in the air , and you come down facing southward , whereas you were facing northward when you ascended . If you are a novice it is all over with that first or second levitation ? all but picking yourself out of the dust . But if you are no novice . just as he made that first leap you raised your quirt and , as he came down , you swung it across his nose with all your strength , and at each succeeding jump you stung him again and again . The long rows of scratches upon his shoulders and his flanks , with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not been idle , though you hardly gave them a thought . This is a con test for supremacy and it must soon be decided in favor of you or the horse . With whip , spur and voice you have called for- the limit of his action . He is now fatigued . He may stop the terrific bucking and trot distractedly around the corral . Instantly the rough treatment ceases The rider scratches the sweating withers soothingly . A few minutes of riding around at a trot and the first lesson is ended . Look out for trouble as you dismount , for defeat breed hatred . Gather your near rein short , seize himane and drop from his back so that you will land in front of him , avoiding the risk of a vicious kick . There has been no attempt to teach the horse the rein . To-morrow you will saddle him in the same manner and before the second lesson is over he will feel the pull of the bridle . The third day you will go for a short ride . The mustang is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " snaffle bit colt . "  |p763  A wild horse may cease bucking entirely after ten minutes , or he may not cease after five years . - Again , a lively stallion may make his rider feel that he is living years while the clock is ticking away minutes . One day a vaquero , a wonderful rider in spite of the fact that one leg was permanently withered from an injury received in his early busting days , straddled a nine-year-old bay and ordered the ropes cast off . The horse rose and bucked steadily for nearly fifteen minutes , when the vaquero let go with hands and feet and allowed himself to be tossed over the animal 's head . He landed on his hands and knees in approved fashion , suffering no injury by the fall . but he could not rise . The horse stood quivering with his legs . set far out to keep him from tumbling over . After that terrible jolting both man and horse were bleeding from the nose , mouth and ears . The vaquero was never again the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as a rule , is under thirty-five . When a man 's frame has acquired rigidity and his bones have become brittle he had better be the second , third or fifth , rather than the first man to board a " bronc . " Busters take up their trade in boyhood . They have lived in the saddle five or six years by the time they cast their first vote . Properly mounted , one of these riders will cover ninety or one hundred miles in a day and feel no special weariness . Take his horse from under him . and it would worry him to walk five miles . He is a man without thighs or calves , never having had any of the sort of exercise that develops them . He will squat and sit back comfortably on his bootheels to eat his supper when out on the range and remain by the campfire half the night swapping yarns with you without once altering his posture . He will tell you that broncos are like bicycles when it comes to teaching one to carry you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least possible damage . I have seen busters actually practising the art of taking falls on straw-covered ground , for none knows when his accomplishments in this line may alone save him from death or injury . When the buster is hurled into the air he may land upon his hands , or he may land upon his hands and knees , but he is . most likely to land upon his . feet . Frequently he flies from the saddle : he knows that it is the safest way to dismount from a bad one that has not yet " run down . " Having begun his riding lessons at - an age when the boy of a tenderer breed is careering wildly upon a hobby horse , it may be . assumed that the buster does not rate feats of this kind as especially dangerous or unusual . The outlaw never surrenders . He may evade the traps entirely for years . Once inside the canvas wall he is almost human in devising ways to escape . If he gets away it is usually at the cost of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stampede in the trap and has leaped over the canvas barrier from the top of a pyramid composed of the writhing bodies of his band . The outlawry of a wild horse is proclaimed by the fact that his breaking is of no avail . Should an outlaw kill or disable his buster in the first encounter , he is thrown to the ground while another buster mounts him in that position . The outlaw will continue to buck-jump until he is exhausted , then he will stand quietly or trot about with the man upon his back . The submission is but temporary and when next he is saddled the terrific bucking will go on as long as the horse is physically able to keep it up . And at the next saddling , and the next and the next . Some horses plainly  |p764  prefer death to submission to man , and violent death has sometimes come in a way that could be called nothing but suicide . The horses that survive the first strenuous lessons and continue to fight can be divided into two classes ? those that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those that surrender conditionally , renewing the fight as opportunity arrives . A horse of the first class has , almost invariably , a misshapen head ; " crazy " is written across his face . Horses of the second class are far above the average in intelligence . Their violence is not without method . They will charge a mounted man when necessary to escape and will even put the rider and his mount under foot . They give slack unexpectedly in order to cut in two with their teeth a rawhide riata such as no horse could break . Some sections of the wild horse range are famous for the outlaws that have fought and died there in the past or that are there to-day . " The southern part of Fish Creek Valley , near the Eureka-Nye county line , has produced many of these horses , " said " Pete " Barnum , " and undoubtedly most of them were descendants of that same spotted mustang stallion which defied every attempt to capture him . He weighed less than 1,000 pounds and was peculiarly marked , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was covered with irregular splashes of black . We hated the horse because of his way of spreading uneasiness among all the bands that might be grazing within several miles ; many a time he cost us our quarry . Of course we tried to capture the stallion , and we got many members of his band , but he was never to be taken captive . His very obstinacy saved him ; he could not be steered into the hidden trap , and no man was ever able to rope him . Three years ago he was sentenced to death by the men who could not take him after ten years of trying , but it was not until last August that the sentence could be carried out . He wandered to a spring on a range new to him and went down before a rifle while drinking . Not until after his death ? which was unfairly dealt ? did we learn that the black spots with which he was covered were but marks of battles with other stallions . Where savage teeth had torn away skin and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of white . " For years a big blood-red stallion ranged the rugged mountains dividing Antelope and Monitor Valleys . The section was so thickly covered with cedars that even to locate him was difficult . When we tried to run him down he eluded us in the timber ; our traps , effective enough with other horses , he discovered and evaded . In the winter of 1905 the snow was so deep in his mountains that he could not paw through it to grass , and he was forced down into the valley , mingling , for the first time since we had known him , with the bands . One day in early spring three of us took up the chase , mounted upon strong , eager horses . We separated when we had the red stallion located and one man made a wide circuit , dismounted , and by crawling actually got within a few hundred yards of the old renegade . The stallion scented the man before he saw him and set off at top speed . The vaquero gave him a hard race for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fresh mount and kept the stallion leaping . Half an hour later the third man , following the program , spurred out of cover and took up the pursuit , armed with a sixty-foot riata . They had not gone half a mile when the rider nailed ' his game . It took all the rope to do it and only eighteen inches was left to snub around the saddle horn . He made a splendid fight , rearing and surging , but finally went down and we bound him fast . " Until we saddled him we did not realize his desperation . We fastened the riata to his front feet ; when he tried to run away we jerked his feet from under him , throwing him heavily ; as he attempted to rise we threw him again , and repeated the maneuver until exhaustion necessitated his capitulation . But his surrender was only temporary . For three years we tried to break him , using every artifice known to us ? as quickly as one man gave up the task another would try to conquer him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bridle or saddle him he would bite viciously , while his eyes , protruding from the sockets , blazed fiery red with hate . As the cinch was drawn tight the outlaw , if upon his feet , invariably reared straight up , poised upon his hind legs , then hurled himself backward ti ) the ground . We always mounted him while he was tied down , and to stay ' after he gained his feet cared for action which boiled a day 's work into thirty minutes of struggle . His end was as tragic as his career : in making an attempt at escape by jumping out of a stockade corral he misjudged the distance and became impaled on a jagged post , and a forty-four w turned loose upon him to end his suffering . " The big chestnut stallion we named Stampede was another example of the outlaw that never yields to the mastery of man . Reared in a rocky section of the mountains bordering Cortez Valley , early in life he developed remarkable surefootedness , plunging down the boulder-stream slopes at appalling  |p765  speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over obstacles rather than go around them . In fleetness he surpassed any other horse known to have been bred in these mountain ranges . The mare that raised him was an ordinary mustang , but the colt had the markings and many of the traits of a thoroughbred . The contrast between mare and colt caused them to be spotted among the bands of wild horses seen in that part of Eureka County . Expedition after expedition set out to capture the fine colt ? and came back without the quarry . It was late in August when the chestnut was eight years old , after the grass had browned and withered , that Nookie , a Shoshone Indian , secreted himself and his horse in a mass of boulders close to a mountain spring to which Stampede led his hand to drink . As the stallion stood with lowered head filling himself with cool water , the Indian rode out from the rocks and shot his riata . The rawhide was about the stallion 's neck almost before he realized his danger . As he felt its sting and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Indian 's horse was jerked to his knees . Stampede took instant advantage of the situation . He had started up the mountain , but now turned and ran straight down . and had not the rope caught under a pine stump and then snubbed around it , the stallion would have made his escape . He struggled until his breath came in gasps and his eyes protruded , but the rawhide held . The Indian . after , reenforcing his hold upon his prize with a second rope , executed a dance of joy , for all alone he had taken the racehorse stallion that had defied the mustangers for eight years . " Stampede was not a difficult horse to mount or to ride . He never resisted the saddle , but to bridle him required the services of two strong men . One man had to hold him upon the ground with a rope while the other forced the bit between the teeth and buckled the leather into place . Unless heated in a contest , he would obey the rein , but in a race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after a bunch of mustangs , he would soon overhaul them and would continue on ahead of the flying herd ; pulling and jerking on a spade or ring bit had absolutely no effect upon him . " Looking down into Cortez Valley is a wide bald flat known as Frenchy Mountain . Many bands of mustangs that fed here escaped time after time because we had no saddle horses sufficiently fleet and surefooted to outrun them down the jagged , precipitous side of that mountain . As we sat around our campfire one evening , Nookie announced a surprising proposition . He offered to go alone to the summit of Frenchy Mountain , start the hands of mustangs and race down that awful mountainside with them , relying upon his skill and his ability to manage Stampede to divert them into trails along which the men would lie concealed until time to spring out and rush the bands into the trap . On the day selected for the run Nookie left camp early . Stampede was in an ugly mood , having bruised one eye badly against the ground while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summit and as he burst out upon the mustangs and set them to leaping down the mountainside , Stampede ran with the ease and grace of a deer . Nookie , shouting and swinging his quirt , did not attempt to restrain his runaway horse , which came bounding down the ridges like a rolling boulder . A run of two or three miles brought the mustangs to the brink of a canon , the sides of which were perpendicular walls of porphyry . Stampede had carried his rider into the midst of the terrified herd and together they raced toward the edge of the chasm . I was watching them through me glass from a good point of vantage . Suddenly the wild band swerved sharply to the left and tore along the canon edge . Nookie jerked furiously upon one rein and then upon the other , but Stampede ( lid not turn . The Indian could not guide his horse , and neither could he check him . I realized that Stampede was running away for the last time , that a tragedy was about to be enacted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass . I shall always believe that that last hundred yards to the brink was covered with a burst of speed . Stampede did not tumble over the edge ? he leaped . Mine was a profile view . For an instant I saw a man on a horse silhouetted against blue sky . Under them , over them , around them was nothing but air . The outlaw 's body was broken upon the rocks and cactus three hundred feet below , and under the horse died as plucky an Indian as ever climbed into saddle . "
