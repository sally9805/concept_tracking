THE interest of the world is at present centered on the Isthmus of Panama and the wonderful - work in progress there , so that in general little attention is paid , except by those commercially interested , to the adjacent group of small independent republics occupying the intervening space from Panama northward to the border of Mexico . They are apt to he thought of as countries continually torn by internal strife , devastated by earthquakes , and ravaged by disease ? in fact , a sort of tropical wilderness scarcely worthy of a visit . Never was there greater mistake . The beauty of the cities , the rapid extension of railroads , the cultivation and enormous proceeds of a wonderfully rich and fertile soil , all convince us of the progress of a people living amidst a wealth of scenic beauty and a perfection of climate rarely equaled . This is particularly true of Guatemala , the most northern of the group , which , under the long and peaceful administration of President Estrada Cabrera , has been rapidly forging ahead to take its place on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Three days ' delightful sail from New Orleans to Puerto Barrios on one of the fine ships of the United Fruit Company brings us to these sun-kissed shores , where stately palms , stirred by perfumeladen breezes , wave in greeting . The steady increase of American and German interests here is fast opening for our benefit one of the loveliest countries in the world , and the building of railroads is placing within easy reach the enjoyment of its natural beauties .  |p596  THE SUCCESS OE AMERICAN INDUSTRIES All of the railroads are owned by an American syndicate and are absolutely under American control . From Puerto Barrios , on the Caribbean , the Northern road runs a distance of 224 miles up to the city of Guatemala , the capital . From here starts the Guatemala Central road , extending a distance of 74 miles to the port of San Jose , on the Pacific . The . Guatemala Central Railroad has in all 216 miles of road throughout the country , and now in course of construction is a branch line 38 miles in length , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the border of Mexico , to connect directly with the Pan-American road there . In a few months it will be possible to travel by railway from New York city to the capital of Guatemala . This country was for centuries the home of the Maya-Quiche Indians , whose history reads like a romance . Cortez , however , after the conquest of Mexico , desiring to extend his power over the country farther south , in 1522 sent an invading army under the command of Pedro de Alvarado to subjugate this powerful race . Leaving Mexico with some 300 Spaniards and a great number of Mexican Indians , Alvarado fought his way into Guatemala , overcoming all who opposed him , and finally , on July 25 , 1521 , founded the first Spanish capital under the name of Santiago de los Caballeros ( Saint James of the Cavaliers ) . And so it happened that , in a beautiful valley at the foot of two great volcanoes , " Agua " and " Fuego " ( meaning water and fire ) , was firmly established the Spanish rule which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , until September 15 , 1821 , when Guatemala became an independent republic . This first Spanish city was , however , 20 years later , almost completely wiped out of existence by a great flood of water which poured down upon it from Agua . There has been much controversy among scientists as to the origin of this flood . Some claim it to have been the result of a cloudburst , others that it came from the crater of the supposedly extinct volcano . The former supposition seems to be the most plausible , as research has so far failed to discover traces of a considerable body of water ever having existed in the crater . The few survivors fled down the valley and at a distance of three miles chose the site of a new city , and , in 1542 , courageously founded a second capital , now known as Antigua . In time it grew to have a population of 100,000 inhabitants , and became a great center of learning , with many universities , monasteries , and over a hundred churches rich in works of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or less severe , it flourished until July 29 , 1773 , when , without warning , in one minute the proud city was leveled to the ground . THE RELOCATION OF GUATEMALA 'S CAPITAL Again the survivors of this second calamity sought refuge farther away from the threatening volcano , and , at a distance of 35 miles , finally settled in the beautiful valley of Las Vacas . Here , at an altitude of 5,000 feet above the sea , surrounded on all sides by soft green hills , behind which loom the imposing heads of three volcanoes , lies the city of Guatemala , the present capital , founded by the courageous survivors of one of the greatest calamities in the history of any land . This typical city of Spanish America is a most interesting and charming place to visit . Coming directly from the land of sky-scrapers , the first impression of it , with its low white buildings , is particularly attractive . Here and there is a house tinted a bright pink or a vivid blue , thus varying the monotony of the dazzling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though the houses had put on their beet gown to welcome the stranger . The climate is one of perpetual spring , the average temperature being about 70 degrees . The summer months bring the heavy rains . Although in a land of earthquakes ,  |p597  this city has suffered little from them , only experiencing slight shocks from time to time . During my entire six months ' stay in this country I did not feel even a tremor , and I really think that my friends were rather disappointed when I returned and was unable to give thrilling accounts of one of nature 's upheavals . With a population of 100,000 inhabitants , the city is laid out on a splendid scale , with broad avenues , fine parks , and handsome buildings . It is one of the best-lighted cities in the world . Street cars , little mule cars , run from one end to the other , and already a concession has been granted to an American syndicate for the construction of an electric line . In the center of the city is the Plaza de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handsome statue of Columbus . This plaza becomes the rendezvous of fashion three or four evenings of the week , when an exceptionally fine band plays . Here also each morning at 10 o'clock a company of the President 's Guard of Honor parades . Most interesting scenes are also witnessed on the nights of any national holiday or church festival . The Indians come in from the surrounding country early in the day and install themselves in picturesque groups , selling native sweets , cocoanut water , and beautiful fruits . As night comes on they build fires which illumine their dark faces and brilliant costumes . The trees are hung with gay lanterns and at one side is stretched a great canvas upon which a free moving-picture show is in progress . The band plays , and between times is heard the rather weird music of the marimba . This native instrument has a peculiar charm and , in spite of a certain metallic sound , not unlike a xenophone , when played in the open air has very beautiful tones . Often in the dead of night one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instruments as some dark-eyed senorita is being serenaded . The Cathedral , which stands facing the plaza , with its two square towers , is a fine example of the churches of Spanish America . A curious but not unpleasing effect is obtained in the interior by the blue-and-white ceiling . All the churches of the city are rich in wood carvings , paintings , and antique altar silver saved from the ruins of Antigua . Throughout the country wherever the churches have suffered from earthquakes and the crumbling towers are no longer strong enough to bear the weight of the heavy bells , these are hung out of doors under a pointed thatched roof held by bamboo poles , which adds greatly to the picturesqueness of the landscape . The Teatro Colon , the national theater , is a building of which any city would be proud . It is copied from the Church of the Madeleine in Paris . It is generously subsidized by the government , and good operatic and dramatic companies come from Italy , Spain , and Mexico . Bull-fighting is , of course , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To the west of the city stretches the broad avenue of La Reforma , a beautiful drive several miles in length , shaded by great trees and containing some fine statues , the two most important being those of Gen. Rufino Barrios and Gen. Garcia Granados . At the beginning of the driveway stands the artillery barracks , a rather imposing building , and at the opposite end is the National Museum . At the other end of the city is the wide boulevard leading to the hippodrome or race-course . Here we come upon the beautiful Temple of Minerva . President Cabrera believes in education , and under his enthusiastic directions there is no little town but has its public school . To commemorate the education of the youth of the country , he has set aside one day each year ? the last Sunday in October ? as a popular festival , and all scholars and teachers take part in the celebration , which is known as the Feast of Minerva . In each town of any importance is now to be found one of these temples . HOW @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the president 's term of office being for six years . The legislative power is vested in a national assembly , which consists of one house composed of a deputy for each 20,000 inhabitants . Beginning the first of March , the annual sessions are held , lasting two months . I well remember on the day of the convening of Congress that I expressed a desire of attending , as in other countries , one of the sessions . Had I dropped a bomb in the midst of the group who overheard the remark I could scarcely have caused greater excitement . " Impossible ! Unheard of ! Women did not go to Congress , " etc . The rumor spread , however , that the American girl wished to go , and a few days later my father received a gracious note from Senor Ubico , President of the Senate , inviting us to be present on a certain evening , for the meetings are held at night . Nearly a hundred members were present and several important bills were passed , among them one granting the concession for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the border of Mexico . It was most interesting and I had the honor of being the first , and , as far as I know , as vet , the only woman who has ever been admitted within the Congress Hall of Guatemala . I was fortunate enough , also , through the courtesy of President Cabrera , to be shown the Palace . another place a woman has never been admitted to . Soldiers were drawn up and presented arms as we entered the large court , and we were met by one of the generals , resplendent in gold lace , whom the President had detailed to escort us . The wide white marble stairway , the reception rooms , and banqueting hall would bear comparison with many in the royal homes of Europe . It was here that , on March 11 , 1909 , President Cabrera entertained Rear Admiral Swinburn , then in command of the American Pacific squadron , and some 30 of his officers . Never have I seen such  |p599  lavish expenditure as during the four days when our officers were this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , flowers , and illuminations . The ball given by the city , and at which Boo guests sat down to supper in the beautiful " patio " of the Municipal Palace , was the most gorgeous affair of its kind I have attended . These patios , or courts , are characteristic of the buildings , public or private , throughout the country . Here indeed a man 's house is his castle . The windows looking onto the streets are rarely opened , and for good reason . What in our country are known as sneak thieves here have an original way of obtaining their spoils . A long string with a fish-hook at the end is the instrument employed , and this , thrown in between the bars with a dexterity equal to the lasso-throwing of the cowboy , falls unerringly upon the chosen object , which in a twinkling is whisked away . Woe to the person who , leaving his things scattered around , goes out of the room without closing the window . THE SELE-APPOINTED REGULATORS OE THE PUBLIC HEALTH " The National Health Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most original . Sopolotes , or buzzards , are the scavengers of the land , keeping country and city scrupulously clean . One soon becomes accustomed to the long rows of these solemn but ungainly birds patiently waiting to pounce upon any morsel thrown out . Soap is their favorite dainty , and , as they are great thieves , it is impossible to keep a piece of this particular article unless well hidden . Living is cheap here and housekeeping not difficult , particularly if one knows a little Spanish . The markets , besides being attractive and picturesque , are excellent . There is no fixed price for anything , and one soon learns to offer just half of what is asked . Then naturally follows more bargaining , and one finally gets the goods for at least two-thirds less than the original price . The servants are mostly Indians and are exceptionally good . They learn quickly , and with a little patience can soon be converted into model domestics . Their wages are about 5o pesos , or some $3 gold , a month . The signs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I remember one in particular , which translated reads , " Milk from the cow 's foot . " It meant that the cow would be brought to the door and milked before one 's eyes . Whether this improved the quality of the milk I was never able to determine . The most original sign seen in Guatemala was a poster advertisement of a moving-picture show . This was on the wall of a native school-house in the Carib village at Livingston . It read : " Tonight , in the Practical School , the Life and Passion of Christ and other comic moving pictures . " THE ANCIENT CAPITAL OE ANTIGUA In strange contrast to the modern city of Guatemala is the old ruined one of  |p601  Antigua , which I have mentioned , and which to those remaining only a short time in the country is the most important place to visit . It is preferable to ride , although one can drive in old-fashioned canvas-covered diligences . The earlier the start after sunrise the better , for the road as far as the Indian town of Mixco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are jogging into the city heavily laden with great loads of earthen pottery , fresh fruits , and vegetables for the market . Mixco is picturesquely situated , nestling at the ? foot of the mountains and commanding an extended view of the great Guatemala Valley . with the city almost at one 's feet , and in the distance the sparkling blue waters of lovely Lake Amatitlan . Leaving the highroad one turns into a narrow defile , and up and down hill follows an old Indian trail , sometimes completely shut in , again widening with glimpses of the mountains as range after range rises to the imposing heads of three great volcanoes ? Agua , Fuego , and Acatenango . I do not know of any place I have visited , not even Pompeii , which made such a deep impression upon me as this city of the past . Nestled in a broad , fertile valley , the climate of which is unsurpassed , nothing can exceed it in solemn grandeur . Watched over by the giant Agua , which rises in one magnificent unbroken sweep to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretches dazzlingly white in the brilliant sunshine . Not a sound breaks the silence which hangs like a pall over the place , and even the modern town of some 30,000 inhabitants seems dead , and a strange hush lies over all . The quaint little pink hotel , with its flower-filled patio , the air heavy with the scent of roses , orange blossoms , and starry-eyed jasmine , is in keeping with the atmosphere of romance which pervades the place . Of half a hundred churches still standing , those of the Cathedral . San Francisco , and Recollecion are the most imposing . Of the first-named enormous edifice , 300 feet in length , only the outer walls , pierced by 5o windows , and a few graceful arches remain of what must have been a wonderfully beautiful building . The bright blue sky looks down on a tangled mass of trees and flowers , and here in the midst of this sad reminder of past grandeur lives an Indian family , the roof of their outdoor kitchen supported by wonderfully carved pillars of wood . A woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which she was pounding wet corn preparatory to making " tortillas , " the flat corn cakes which , with black beans , is the staple food of the country . We were invited to stop and watch the process , and boxes and a dilapidated chair or two were brought forth from some mysterious recess for our comfort .  |p602  The picturesque corner , with the Indian woman in her native costume kneeling in the light of a flickering wood fire ; roundeyed , staring children of all ages ; dogs , chickens , and pigs innumerable ; the exquisitely carved pillars etched against the gray background of ruined walls , and the delicate branches of a cherry tree in full bloom , giving the harmonious touch of color ? all combined to make a picture never to be forgotten . As the twilight fell dark figures glided silently by , balancing on their heads large flat baskets of fruits for the morrow 's market , and seeking a restingplace beneath the dim arches , where here and there heaps of corn husks showed that at night this grim pile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also most impressive , and from the crumbling belfry is obtained a magnificent view of city and surrounding country . The beautiful ruins of Recollecion are the property of a German-American priest , who reaps great benefit from his gardens and coffee plantation , which he cultivates during his leisure hours . It seemed rather incongruous to see fat black hogs contentedly rooting under the shadow of these historical walls , but this " padre " is nothing if not practical . Not far from here is the estate of " Pastores , " where there is a large flour-mill , the only one of its kind in this part of the country . Three miles from the city are the beautiful warm sulphur baths of Medina and Cubo , to reach which one passes through great sugar plantations on roads in perfect condition , shaded by trees which , meeting overhead , form a cool green archway as far as the eye can see . Further on is Cuidad Vieja , the site of the first capital . All that remains of historical interest are the two crumbling walls of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  |p604  DEVELOPMENT OP THE EXPORT TRADE There is a fascination about this valley impossible to describe , and a spell seems to be cast over all who come here . It is difficult to tear one 's self away and return to the busy life of the outer world , which in this country , however , can be seen to the best advantage on the great banana , coffee , and sugar estates , or " fincas , " as they are called . Bananas are grown almost exclusively on the Atlantic side . The largest banana plantation of the country is that of " Virginia , " owned by the United Fruit Company of Boston . It covers 5,000 acres of land and exports annually 300,000 bunches of bananas , the total export from all sections of Guatemala being 1,500,000 bunches . The output of the United Fruit Company 's Guatemala , Panama , Colombia , Costa Rican , and Jamaica plantations exceeds 22,000,000 bunches of bananas a year . The company has some 70 ships of from 3,000 to 6,000 tons running to the United States and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the cultivation of sugar-cane and the raising of cattle . The best coffee is grown in the highlands at an altitude of from 1,500 to 5,000 feet . THE COUNTRY 'S PRODUCTION OF SUGAR From the city to the port of San Jose , on the Pacific , the Guatemala Central Railroad passes the largest of the sugar estates . San Jose is the seaside resort of the country during the months corresponding to our winter , and here one finds a good hotel , fine bathing ( although the undercurrent is to be feared ) , and a splendid iron pier some thousand feet long . The landing of passengers here is amusing to the onlooker , but far from reassuring for the ones concerned , who dangle helplessly in midair in a sort of iron cage , as steamers can not come up alongside of the pier , and a small boat has to be the means of transfer . But to return to the sugar . Shortly after leaving Guatemala City , the road follows for 15 miles the borders of Lake Amatitlan. where the Indian women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abound all along this body of water for their laundry work . At the town of Palin one is greeted by an extremely . picturesque scene , for the train is besieged by Indians in gay costumes balancing on their heads large flat baskets of gorgeous tropical fruits ? " forbidden fruit , " indeed , to the traveler until thoroughly acclimated . I have never eaten such luscious pineapples as are grown here , besides many wonderful and delicious tropical fruits of which we of the - North know nothing . Here we are directly on the opposite side of Agua from Antigua and a magnificent panorama lies before us ? on the right the fertile slopes of the great volcano , and before us the smiling , sunlit plain stretching away 40 miles to the blue waters of the Pacific . Concepcion is perhaps one of the most interesting of the many large plantations . It covers 155.000 acres and produces each year 10,000 tons of sugar , 20,000 bags of coffee , besides many hundred head of cattle and thousands of bushels of corn . It belongs to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , on which it pays 15 per cent . All of these estates have miles of private railroad , and a continual stream of little cars piled high with sugar-cane run from the distant fields to the factory . The process of sugar - making is interesting to watch from the very beginning , when the juice is crushed out of the cane by giant machinery . The dry fiber is then used to stock the enormous furnaces over which seethe and bubble huge caldrons of syrup . Boiled down to a soft mass like caramel , it is poured into shallow vats to cool . The unrefined sugar , of a dark-brown color , is commonly used throughout the country . It is called " panela , " and is molded into half-round cakes , of which two together make a ball , and is then curiously wrapped in corn husks . The dwelling-houses on all the estates are invariably comfortable , with wide , shady porches and every modern improvement and convenience , at night being lighted by electricity .  |p609  It was my good fortune to stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than Pacayal , a coffee plantation way up in the mountains at an altitude of 5,000 feet . It is a 3o-mile horseback ride after leaving the railroad at the station of Cocales . We stopped over night at the Indian town of Patalul , where there is a new hotel , primitive but clean . We rode into this town at sunset to find ourselves in the midst of a real country fair . It was an odd scene , the booths of bamboo and groups of dark-faced Indians squatting around camp-fires . The sound of bells and discordant music reached us , and as we came in front of the church a procession was just coming out , headed by a life-size figure of the Virgin , borne on the shoulders of women . It was the finishing touch to an already unusual scene , as it ? - ended its way down the crooked streets between the fires , the twinkling lights of many waxen tapers and the crimson glow of the sunset heightening the already brilliant coloring of the native costumes . THE CULTIVATION OE ' COFFEE AND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acres , boasts some of the finest coffee in Guatemala . Coffee is not a natural product  |p613  of this soil , having been introduced into the new world by a Spanish priest in Guatemala , who obtained the seed from Arabia . The trees are first raised in nurseries , and when a few months old are transplanted . A coffee field in full bloom , with its wealth of fragrant white blossoms , is indeed a beautiful sight . When ready for picking the bright red berries greatly resemble cherries . When we arrived at Pacayal the Indians were still harvesting , the result of a good day 's work being about three bushels of berries apiece . Each day these are weighed , the pickers receiving a check and being paid off in full every Saturday . They earn about seven or eight cents a day for twelve hours ' work , besides a home , which consists of a bamboo hut . There is little discontent among these children of the open air , except when occasionally a bottle of " guaro , " the cheap alcoholic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is generally accomplished by some loving spouse , who travels under cover of the night and by stealth to the nearest village to obtain the coveted beverage for her liege lord . As soon as picked the coffee is pulped to prevent fermentation in the pulp . which would stain the bean . From the pulper it goes into great fermenting tanks , where it remains from 24 to 48 hours , in order to take off the sweet , gummy substance which is on the hull . It is then washed and spread to dry in the sun on large asphalt terraces called " patios . " When thoroughly dry it is put through a huller to take off the fine silvery skin , and is finally ready for the market . One bushel of berries gives ten pounds of cleaned coffee . The crop of Pacayal last year was 20,000 bags . Each bag is of 130 pounds . We had many a delightful dance in the moonlight on these slippery patios , which at night make ideal ball-rooms . Many children are employed all day in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beans , and at night brushing them under cover as protection from the dew . It was amusing to watch them , and we became much interested in one boy in particular as an example of what teaching and the influence of civilization can do . He had been brought to the finca a few years before from the mountains where his parents were wild people , living upon raw things and knowing nothing of the uses of water except as a beverage . lie had learned quickly , and during our visit was promoted to the dining-room as " assistant butler . " Disliking the length of his hair , however , we attempted to cut it ; but , as we only had finger-nail scissors , the result was somewhat startling . It gave his head a Marcelwave-like effect unusual even among Indians , and from that time on he would have nothing more to do with us . His name was " Saie . " An early morning ride to the adjoining sugar fiuuca of Saint Emilia was the most beautiful I have taken . Single file we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wilderness of giant trees linked together by trailing vines ; a profusion of vari-colored orchids ; a soft pink carpet of waxen begonia ; great splashes of scarlet made by the peculiar blossom of the plantain . and here and there an enormous poinsettia bloom . Over all a tangled mass of blue-and -- white morning-glories heavy with sparkling clew . Coming out suddenly upon the brow of a hill , we saw the white houses of Saint Emilia lying 1,00 feet below , like jewels in a green velvet case . Behind towered the mountains and in the distance sparkled the blue waters of the Pacific . In this same part of the country , tucked still further away in the mountains , at an altitude of 8,000 feet and 40 miles from the railroad , lies the interesting city of Quezaltenango . In April , 1902 , it was almost totally destroyed by an earthquake , which occurred at the same time as the wholly unexpected eruption of the volcano Santa Maria . Like the Italians who time after time fly in terror from the shadow of the dread Vesuvius and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ momentarily abandon their homes . In this city of  |p615  some 23,000 inhabitants we find the unique sight of stately new buildings side by side with crumbling ruins . A partially successful attempt has been made to rebuild this once beautiful city . The theater is , if anything , finer than the one in Guatemala City , but unfortunately stands dark and silent most of the time , as few companies venture so far from the beaten track . The market here is unusually interesting , being the center of trade for this section of the country . In none other did I see such brilliant coloring as shown here by the costumes of the different tribes of Indians . It was not far from here that I visited , at a place called Cantel , to my mind one of the greatest tributes to American energy and enterprise in the country . Nestled in a fertile valley is a large cotton factory , the only one of its kind in the republic . Think of a model factory , employing some 400 or 500 hands , where every bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indians or mules . The factory hands are all Indians , mostly women and children , the dexterity of the latter being fairly astonishing . To reach Cantel one must leave the railroad at the Indian town of San Felipe and ride 4o miles up into the mountains . We follow for several miles a level road bordered by lovely coffee fincas , the mountains looming ahead dark and forbidding but gradually softened by the light of coming day to a velvety , misty blue against the pale pink of the sky . The road winds almost completely around Santa Maria , which rises to the towering height of I1,000 feet . As we drew nearer , what at first seemed to be soft , fleecy clouds proved to be clouds indeed , but of steam issuing from the great jagged crater in her side . From here the road begins to ascend , winding up , up , seemingly interminable , like a great white snake crawling into the very heart of the mountains . I was quite unprepared for the grandeur of the scenery , which surpassed anything I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two feet below ; range after range of mountains rising on either side and looming in front like an impenetrable barrier ; rushing , tumbling mountain torrents , falling hundreds of feet in  |p617  beautiful cascades ; above all , the majestic head of Santa Maria lazily puffing out soft clouds of steam . WHERE NATURE PROVIDES STEAM HEAT Still further on the road for miles skirts the edge of a deep ravine , and , looking down hundreds of feet , one sees great columns of steam , rising geyserlike , at regular intervals . Gong the way from every little crack and crevice in the rocks small puffs of steam also issue , and we suddenly shiver as the realization is borne in upon us that the path we so gayly pursue lies over the heart of a live volcano , which at any moment may again bring devastation and death to this lovely land . Here and there were groups of sleeping Indians , huddled together wherever steam was coming from the ground . If one must sleep under the stars on frosty nights , it is surely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite equal , to all intents and purposes , to that which in modern homes is the cause of so much trouble and expense . This is the great highway from the interior to the coast , and a never-ending stream of traffic moves constantly up and down , presenting a most interesting scene ; chiefly Indians , heavily laden with every conceivable article : great loads of curious water-jars , earthen pottery , coffee , sugar , fruit , and vegetables . Then large droves of hogs and fifty or a hundred mules . Most interesting of all to me were the innumerable teams of oxen , patiently drawing great creaking loads of raw cotton destined for the far-away factory . The lakes of Guatemala are not numerous , but are very beautiful . We have already glimpsed at Amatitlan , and , still further off , again up into the mountains , lies the crater lake of Atitlan , incomparable for beauty and magnificence of scenery . To avoid the heat of the day -- for the season was already advanced ? we arranged to journey thither by night . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our native friends ; but , then , anything was to be expected of " gringos , " or foreigners . So just at sunset we mounted our mules at the station of Cocales and started gayly off on our 3o-mile ride . Up and down hill , through the beautiful country bathed in moonlight ; fording numerous mountain streams looking like cascades of silver ; through silent Indian villages , where the inhabitants were all sleeping in the open air in front of their queer little bamboo huts . The only sound to break the silence which brooded over the land was the plaintive call of the whippoorwill and the occasional song of the nightingale . ATITLAN , THE CRATER LAKE At midnight we reached the borders of the lake , and at the village of San Lucas took a little steamboat that was in waiting to carry us across to the hotel on the opposite shore . The great expanse of water lay like molten silver in the moonlight , the mountains standing in serried ranks like giant sentinels to guard this treasure . A soft white haze hung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect outline of the two gigantic volcanoes , Atitlan and San Pedro , rising from the water 's edge in one magnificent sweep to the height of 12,000 feet . As we approached the shore a picturesque scene was revealed . The little hotel- stood out white and clear against the dark background of the hill , and below , at the landing place , a group of Indians awaited our arrival , the red glare from many torches casting a lurid glow over the picture . Owned by a German , whose business and pleasure it is to raise countless canaries , this little inn is one of the best in Guatemala . The office presents a unique appearance . From every corner comes the twittering of the tiny feathered inhabitants of many cages , and the walls are curiously papered from floor to ceiling with $50,000 worth of shares of a steamboat company , whose boats were to have plied the lake between San Lucas and Panajachel , but which failed almost  |p619  before it began . Easy chairs and hammocks lend a homelike look to the long vine-covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by unheeded and one forgets the busy world beyond the towering hills . By daylight the beauty and grandeur of the scene , although robbed of the charm and mystery of the moonlight , was none the less perfect . Lying at an altitude of 5,000 feet , about 25 miles in length , this body of water has no visible outlet , although many streams empty into it . Its depth is unknown ; no fish live in its icy waters . Here and there mineral springs bubble to the surface , and the shores are strewn with pumice and stones of volcanic origin . Eleven Indian towns , named after the Apostles , dot the shores , but by far the most interesting is the town of Atitlan , lying snuggled on a beautiful bay running inland between the two great volcanoes . The ground here is a mass of rocks and stones , undoubtedly the result of some volcanic disturbance , and these , loosely piled one upon the other , serve as walls for the huts , which are topped by thatched roofs . As one approaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of huge mushrooms . Here 10,000 Indians , descendants of the once powerful Quiche nation , live entirely to themselves , having an " alcalde , " or governor , of their own tribe . Among them one sees more marked the peculiar and unaccountable resemblance to the Chinese , which is more or less noticeable in all of the Indians throughout the country . It is whispered that these people are fire-worshipers , but that civilization and religious teaching at one time penetrated to this far-away corner is evidenced by the ruins of a church , now standing empty and unused in the center of the town . The interior still contains some fine wood carvings and beautiful altar silver . Never , even among the poor of Italy , have I seen so many children . We were at once surrounded by a throng of them , who accompanied us everywhere , chattering like a lot of monkeys . The costume of these people is very effective against the dull gray background of rocks and thatched roofs . It consists only of a long piece of scarlet cloth wound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guipele , " or shirt . The women wear a scarlet ribbon or narrow piece of cloth wound through the braids and around the head . Solola , a town of 15,000 inhabitants , and capital of the province of the same name , lies some 3,000 feet above the lake . Although a center of commerce , it affords little of interest to the visitor , except the magnificent view of lake and country . A large bare plaza , a ruined church , and a broad new avenue leading to a new school-house , which is painted a brilliant sky blue , are the chief attractions of the place . As we rode into the plaza a military band was playing , but upon our arrival the musicians hurried frantically to the end of the piece and then gave themselves up to staring open-mouthed at us . We dismounted and walked through the public gardens , a most melancholy attempt at embellishment , as the stiff flower beds were without flowers and the fountains , like the school-house , painted bright blue , were without water . The place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our drooping spirits , we indulged in a two-step down the deserted central allee to the strains of a Sousa march ? whether played in our honor as " Americanos " I do not know . We were , however , well repaid for the ride . It has been my good fortune to look down upon many lakes in different parts of the world , but never have I had spread before me a more gorgeous panorama , earth , sky , and water outvying each other in deepest sapphire tones , and seven magnificent volcanoes dominating the wonderful scene . Lake Yzabal is reached by a line of steamers , owned by a German syndicate . plying regularly between Livingston on the Caribbean and Panzos in the interior , on the Polochic River . For the first ten miles we follow the winding course of the beautiful Rio Dulce , or Sweet River ,  |p621  renowned for its scenery , which is very like that of the far-famed Saguenay , in Ouebec . On each side perpendicular walls of green rise to the height of 300 to 400 feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems the boat must run in among the trees and overhanging vines . Then the river broadens and we come out into what is called the Golfete , a pretty body of water ten miles in length and dotted with numerous islands ; through another narrow channel and out into the lake proper . Here stands the old ruined fort of San Felipe , built by the Spaniards in 1524 to g lard the approach to the town of zabal , which used to be the principal port of the Atlantic coast . A sand bar , however , has formed across the mouth of the Rio Dulce , which prevents any large-sized vessels from reaching this inland sea . Although of fresh water , many fish come up from the sea , and even shark are sometimes found here . Crocodiles are numerous , and " mantas , " a species of hippopotamus , commonly called sea-cow. are also found . All the way up the Rio Dulce one sees by the hundreds the beautiful white " garza , " the lovely bird from which is taken the much-desired and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wild and sparsely populated part of the country , lies the lake of Peten , or San Andres , of which , as yet , very little is known . On an island in the center of the lake is the city of Flores , known only to antiquaries . Here are many curious ruins and stone idols , the origin of which is as yet unknown . There is a vast field for research in this country , where little is known of the races who were its first inhabitants . But that the ancient American civilization was highly developed is a fact beyond doubt , for the remains of numerous prehistoric cities have been discovered throughout Central America . THE INEXPLICABLE RUINS OF ' QUIRIGUA Among the most remarkable are the ruins of Quirigua , in Guatemala . Situated in , the valley of the Motagua River , some o miles from its mouth , they are completely hidden in a thick tropical jungle , and consist of square and oblong mounds and terraces . The chief interest , however , centers in several carved monoliths , three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet in height . The as yet untranslated hieroglyphics on these bear some resemblance to the Egyptian , although curiously enough the Greek cross can be also traced . Many theories have been advanced as to the origin of the people whose wonderful works still stand amid the silence of the primeval forests , shrouded in the mystery of ages . There is , of course , much controversy , some ascribing to these ruins great antiquity , while others assert that they are of comparatively recent construction . A o traditions have been found among the Spaniards or the Indians to shed any light upon the subject . The people who built them seem to have had a distinct , independent , and separate existence . Much attention has been given to the deciphering of these inscriptions , but still much remains to be done before the mystery will be solved . Some may elate back 3,000 years or more , while the later dates on others of the Quirigua ruins may be assigned to a place at the beginning of the Christian era . And so with the poet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new ; this clime was old When first the Spaniards came in search of gold . Age after age its shadowy wings have spread , And man was born , and gathered to the dead ; Cities rose , ruled , dwindled to decay , Empires were formed , then darkly swept away ; Race followed race , like cloud-shades o'er the field , The stranger still to stranger doomed to yield .
