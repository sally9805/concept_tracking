 | THE first idea to be drilled into the mind , heart , soul and body of every human being is the firm assurance : " You Can ! " These two words are the biggest in the language . Everybody needs to hear them told , powerfully and often . They should be engraved and illumined above the door of every home , school , church , hospital , factory , forge and shop in America . The greatest favor to be rendered any man is to tell him how much he can do , and how best he may do it . This is the problem of health , of labor , of marriage , of , education , of religion , of culture , of character . And Optimism offers the solution . The power of the Universe is locked in every human mind . Our first duty is to find , release and use this power . Great men are great only because they have explored and revealed their own minds . They have achieved this , without exception , because of their conviction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great men are always optimists . They believe in themselves , their work , their mission , their destiny . Even such orotund pessimists as Carlyle , Schopenhauer and Nietzsche were incorrigible optimists as to their own wiseness . There is a science of optimism ? and it is not safe to be an optimist until you have learned the science . If you are a natural optimist , born that way , you should at once denaturize yourself by marrying a pessimist , or taking one as partner , or hiring one as personal adviser . The reason for such precaution lies in the fact that a natural optimist is generally a natural fool . Because of this deplorable fact , I have little use for merely hereditary optimists . Like poets , they should be heard and not seen . To see one is to become violently discouraged as to the future of the race . To make any man a pessimist , shut him up in the house with an optimist . There are depths of anxiety , perplexity , want , despair , along the road that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high goal . Not to evade these , but to emerge with strength renewed , hope established and sympathy enlarged , is the ideal for an optimist who deserves the name . Convictions are the only sure foundations for ambitions . And to follow your convictions means , often , hell . The test of your faith is how long you can stand on it against the world . Many people have a notion that an optimist is a cheerful , happy-go-lucky sort of person , empty of cares , burdens or problems , smooth and sleek and well fed , favored of gods and men . Believe it not ! All the real optimists I know have been thru battles , worries , woes , privations , that would tear the heart out of an ordinary man a hundred times over . Not the man who always smiles is the optimist , but the man who can always turn frowns and tears into smiles ! The consciousness that everything must finally come right is not born in a moment ; we must first consciously do the thing we know to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ourselves gain a step of ground each time , before we can form the habit of trusting the rightness of the cosmic plan . The days of blind faith are over , the days of intelligent action are here . An efficient optimist hopes entirely without reason , but works entirely with it . Analyze the requisites for your own work , and thus command your own future . Doubtless you possess a longing , dream or wish to have , do or be some particular thing worth while . Are you a blind and lazy pessimist , fearful of yourself and too weak to look your own wish in the face ? Are you a superficial optimist , drunk with your dream and hoping in a vague way that some kind fairy will waft you by magic to the Land of Heart 's Desire ? Or are you a scientific optimist , hoping with your heart while planning with your head and working with your hands ? Every position of trust to which we aspire will demand certain specific traits and forces ? mental , physical and moral . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is the initial step to scientific advancement . To become an optimist one must know how he can advance ; to remain an optimist , one must know he is advancing . We enjoy only what we have earned . Our habits of earning depend most on where and how and why we toil . Hence , in laying the foundation for a lifelong optimism , one of the first moves is to consult the leaders in our chosen trade or profession , and to organize the physical , mental and spiritual forces in ourselves that the leaders in our field think necessary . A thing done well is never done easily . What place do you want to reach ? what price are you willing to pay ? The place is always there for him who gives the price . How much do we want a thing ? Enough to work for it , wait for it , weep and starve and bleed for it , give up the world for it , go thru despair for it ? Then we shall have it . And until then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be able to use it . How does optimism aid efficiency ? By renewing , refreshing , sustaining and strengthening our bodily physique , mental constitution , moral character and psychic reserve . The path to any great success is lined with many small failures ; and the assurance of ultimate success lies in the perception to see and the power to use the lessons from these failures and to go higher because of them . This perception and this power come only to the optimist . The world was against Newton when he proclaimed the law of gravitation ; against Harvey when he discovered the circulation of the blood ; against Wagner when he wrote his epics of harmony ; against Franklin when he searched the skies for the secret of electricity ; against Darwin when he announced the law of evolution ; against Bell when he made the first telephone ; against the Wrights when they labored on the airship ; against Burbank when he dared to invent new species of plants and flowers ; against Froebel when he taught how to understand children better . These men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to carry them thru and beyond the world 's ignorance , blindness , inertness , fear , hate , opposition . And the law still holds . The greater your work and the finer your message , the more you will be antagonized . Your only safeguard is in scientific optimism . What does scientific optimism do for the human machine ? It promotes good digestion and a corresponding sense of buoyancy and cheer ; it straightens the backbone , physical and moral ; it assures deep breathing and the liberation of more energy ; it favors sound sleep and repose at all times ; it lends force , clearness and alertness to the brain because of a purer blood stream and a surer life purpose ; it empowers the will by enlargement and establishment of one 's faith ; it steadies the nerves for a calm , firm handling of the crises , problems and duties of everyday life ; it provides the key to a storehouse of moral dynamics , available only when we see , think , believe and hope for the best ; it expands our influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with higher , spiritual avenues of original conception and power , by means of which the ordinary man becomes great , and every man a conscious master of himself , his work , and his destiny . The charm and beauty of optimism is that every one may acquire it . No matter how poor , weak , ill , sad , forlorn we may be , we can all become optimists , and in doing so can finally change the worst conditions into the best . How ? For answer , let me state a few of the rules in the science of optimism , by means of which hundreds of pessimists , including myself , were taught to think and act sanely and effectively . 1 . Stop grumbling , whining , pining , worrying , pitying yourself . Get busy . Do something , anything , to shake you out of the frozen rut of regret . 2 . Look around you and see how much worse off other people are ? and how much better they are behaving . Study the lives of the world 's heroic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and surmount them . 3 . Find a purpose big enough , and make a will strong enough , to carry you up and over mountains of difficulty . 4 . Hold yourself entirely responsible , not anything nor anybody else , for the troubles and trials that come upon you . They are the results of your past mistakes , to be borne wisely and bravely ; or they are the means to your present development , to be studied calmly and utilized fully . Weeping at misfortune only blinds one to its mission , and blaming something or somebody only , weakens one when he should be strongest . 5 . Analyze each loss , pain , perplexity or hardship , saying to yourself , " What can this teach me , how can it develop me ? " When sorrow ends in strength , sorrow becomes joy . 6 . Exercize , work and play out of doors all you can . The muscle of an athlete seldom goes with the mind of a worrier . The pessimist is always a negative person , and the cultivation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blues " leave the brain as red blood pours in. 7 . Build up your digestion . Much pessimistic thought is merely autointoxication , or a stagnant condition of arteries and nerves due to a lazy liver , weak stomach , or overtaxed kidneys . A man weak in food science is almost sure to be weak in faith . 8 . Learn which of your mental faculties are naturally dull or defective , use modern methods to sharpen and strengthen them . A person weak in the faculty of hope , or of caution , or of economy , or of self-esteem , or of continuity , or of any of a dozen more faculties of the mind , will have occasion to grieve much and often ; but mostly on account of his own folly . 9 . Study books that teach the art of happiness , and the cure of illness , poverty , oppression , sadness , fear , confusion , doubt . The mind needs tonics far more than the body does . And an optimistic writer is doctor , nurse and druggist for an ailing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manual of optimism ever given to the world . But there are a few modern books that teach the modern science of optimism , in a modern way , to fit modern conditions . Every home , church and school should contain some of these , and every man or woman who hopes to do great things should take such a book for a constant companion . 10 . Make yourself smile , whether you feel like it or not . We enjoy looking at our picture because the photographer made us " look pleasant " ; and to look pleasant long enough is to feel pleasant . All tragedy borders on smiles ; do n't plunge so deep into tragedy , play a little more around the edges . We have millions of years in which to become strong and wise and great ; should any happening of a moment rob us of our poise ? 11 . Do n't be ashamed to cry . There are depths of disappointment and grief when nothing but a great flood of tears will sweep the mass of wo from the valleys of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hights. 12 . Lift some other fellow 's burden ? and you will find that your own has fallen off , or at least you carry it more easily . Self-absorption is the root of pessimism ; dig out the root and the branch withers . Failures in optimism are always failures in altruism . Scientific optimism is faith in self , God and man ; plus knowledge of material conditions required for the attainment of a specified goal ; plus will to work long and hard , and use every means and event , good or ill , for the transmutation of experience into achievement . The lever with which to move the world is an irrepressible faith , grounded on irrefutable knowledge , backed by an irremovable will . Have you this faith , Have you this knowledge ? Have you this will ?
