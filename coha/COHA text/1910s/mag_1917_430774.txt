 | It may fairly be a subject of pride to the Southern people that the first telegraph line in the United States was laid down in the South . This was the Baltimore-Washington line of 1844 , for which Congress had made an appropriation in March , 1843 . " Laid down " it was ; for the wires were enclosed in leaden tubes and buried in the ground . ' This pipe line telegraphy proving a failure , the wires were next stretched on posts , and the success of this second attempt is a part of history . Notwithstanding the continued pessimism of Congress , promoters lost no time in taking up the new invention , and its success was phenomenal . Morse associated with himself that ubiquitous Jack-of-all-trades , Amos Kendall , and there was soon organized in 1846 the Washington and New Orleans Telegraph Company . This was the second telegraph company organized in the United States ; it was to have a capital of $400,000 , and the thrifty Kendall predicted annual net earnings of $450,000 . The new enterprise was pushed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the construction of the line from Washington to the Carolina boundary , and the other Southern States readily followed her example . It was the plan of the promoters to build their line along the route of the railroad that ran south from Washington . There was by 1847 a continuous line of railroad from Fredericksburg , Virginia , to Atlanta , Georgia , with the exception of the distances from Raleigh and Wilmington , N. C. , to Columbia , S. C. The telegraph was to follow the railroad from Fredericksburg through Richmond and Petersburg to Raleigh ; from Raleigh the route was to be across country through Fayetteville , Cheraw and Camden to Columbia , and thence down the railroad to Charleston and Augusta . From Augusta , a branch line was planned to Savannah , but the main line was to follow the railroad to  | Macon ? its westernmost point . Leaving the railroad here , the telegraph was to follow the stage coach road across the border to Montgomery , and thence down the river to Mobile , and along the coast to New Orleans . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Southern people themselves should furnish the money for the construction of the line . In the opening days of 1847 , he sent out W. B. Lloyd as a special agent to visit the Southern cities , organize branch companies and solicit subscriptions . On the 14th of January , Lloyd spoke before the Chamber of Commerce of Charleston in advocacy of the merits of the proposed telegraph system ; as a result a committee of seven was appointed to investigate the enterprise and to solicit subscriptions , if they found it worthy of support . This committee was made up of men who were active in the promotion of Southern railroads , and Ker Boyce was . perhaps , its most prominent member . The next week Mr. Lloyd travelled on down to Savannah , and the Chamber of Commerce , after hearing him , took action similar to that of Charleston . On the sixth of February , Lloyd reached New Orleans and nine days later the Chamber of Commerce of that lethargic city passed resolutions approving the project and appointed the usual committee to raise funds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in the same way and by the first of March , 1847 , the success of the undertaking was assured . For the most part subscriptions came in readily enough . The ante-bellum South was not by any means the bankrupt , moneyless section it is often represented to have been , and plentiful capital could always be found there to finance any practicable scheme . Two factors contributed to the appeal of the new enterprise . The price of cotton had fallen steadily during the decade , and the Southern people were beginning to show distrust of cotton raising as a road to wealth . Diversified farming and sporadic manufacturing were beginning to make headway . But for several years previous , the favorite form  | of investment for disgruntled capital at the South had been railroad building . It was the expectation of large returns that had led Southern capitalists during the forties to build a railway system in South Carolina and Georgia far surpassing anything to be found north of Mason and Dixon 's line . But even by 1847 , it was beginning to be realized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many Southern capitalists it appeared that the Mississippi commerce which they had been fondly hoping to capture by their railroad extension westward was no better than a will-o ' - the- wisp . Capital , then , in 1847 was chary of further railroad investment and quite ready to take up the telegraph investment promising larger profits . Strange to say , it was at the two chief commercial centers of the South ? Charleston and New Orleans ? that the most difficulty was encountered in raising subscriptions . Charleston had been well-nigh ' drained of her capital by railroad investment in South Carolina and Georgia . The spirit was willing but the pocket book was wofully weak . The actual construction of the line was well under way before Charleston completed her subscription in the last days of April , 1847.9 In New Orleans two sets of factors served to embarrass the new movement . In the first place , there was the old distrust felt by New Orleans toward any sort of a commercial connection with the South Atlantic . This feeling grew out of the efforts which Charleston and Savannah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade and ' divert it over their railroads from New Orleans to their own markets . A second deterrent was the rivalry of a company soliciting subscriptions for a telegraph line from New Orleans up the Mississippi valley to Louisville and Cincinnati . The building of the line was begun from Washington and before Charleston and New Orleans had completed their subscriptions . By the last of March , 1847 , the wires were up from Washington to Alexandria , the posts set as far as Fredericksburg , and material was on hand for the line to Petersburg . It was the plan , however , that the work should be prosecuted on all sections of the route at the same time , and  | by the middle of June the posts had been set on the MobileNew Orleans section for twenty-five miles from each city . By the first of August all but thirty miles of the posts were up between Mobile and New Orleans and had been set for more than one hundred miles on the Mobile-Montgomery line . By October , the posts were all up from Raleigh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were put in communication on the first day of December , and the first message was sent from Charleston to Petersburg on the 14th day of February , 1848.13 Petersburg was already before this date in communication with Baltimore . By the 18th of July , 1848 , the last link south of Charleston ? Macon to Montgomery ? was forged in the telegraphic chain , and so it came to pass by the middle of 1848 that the South had erected entirely by its own energies a " lightning way " reaching entirely across it and connecting its principal cities . Nowhere , even in the North , had there been such progress . In so short a time was the Atlantic and Gulf region of the South provided with telegraphs . But half the story remains to be told ; the Southwest was also building its telegraph line . Even before the Washington and New Orleans enterprise had been started , a company was formed to build from Pittsburg westward to St. Louis and other cities . It was in June , 1845 , that Henry and John O'Reilly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contracted with Morse and Kendall for the use of the Morse patent on this western route , and made it a part of the contract that the new line should not compete with the Washington-New Orleans line . " The " People 's Line , " as it came to be called , was to have its beginning at Pittsburg , run down the Ohio to Wheeling , along the National Road to Columbus , along the railroad to Cincinnati , down the Ohio to Louisville and on to St. Louis . It soon became a part of O'Reilly 's plan to build not only to St. Louis but also to New Orleans , branching off from the St. Louis line at Louisville . The route of this Louisville-New Orleans section was to be the railroad to Lexington , Ky. , then down the old " Natchez trail "  | to Nashville , thence to Memphis and Tuscumbia and from that place to New Orleans via Jackson . The promotion of this section was carried out in much the same manner as the Washington and New Orleans route . Meetings were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committees appointed to solicit subscriptions . O'Reilly , himself , visited New Orleans and urged the enterprise on the people there ? much to the disgust of those who were promoting the eastern line . For a time it seemed that the Crescent City was going to prefer the western line to the eastern as a field for investment ; the economic interests of New Orleans were with the cities of the Mississippi and Ohio . But Lloyd let it be known that the eastern line would bring suit for infringement of patent , and the New Orleans people divided their support between the two companies . At no place were the people backward in investing except at Louisville ; here the enterprise received so little support that the company finally gave it up in despair and established stations outside of Louisville at Jeffersonville and New Albany . In the construction of the People 's Line , the same policy was adopted as by the Washington-New Orleans ; different contractors took charge of different sections and the work was prosecuted in all parts at the same time . There had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build a telegraph line from Louisville to New Orleans using the House patent . The People 's Line now took over the contractors and material of the defunct company , and the work of construction went rapidly forward . Three different contractors undertook the work from Louisville to New Orleans and engaged to have it finished by February , 184822 ? an engagement they were entirely unable to fulfill . The telegraph reached Pittsburg on the 29th of December , 1846 ; by the 7th of August communication was open to Wheeling and by the middle of September , 1847 , to Louis- ville . Over the more southern sections progress was slower , and Nashville was not reached until the 6th of March , 1848,26 and Tuscumbia , the 7th of April . The completion of the last stage from Tuscumbia to New Orleans was delayed by the suit brought by Morse and Kendall for violation of contract . It was claimed that The People 's Line by building into New Orleans would be coming into competition with the eastern line , and an injunction was asked for . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work was stopped on the new line . The trouble was settled late in 1848 , and the People 's Line built on into New Orleans unmolested , absorbing a rival company that Lloyd had organized to build a parallel line . This western line , it must be said , was but poorly constructed and soon began to go to pieces ; before many years it had to be entirely rebuilt . Thus was the South in the short space of two years provided with two main lines of telegraph and many branches . It is to be remembered that this work was carried on in the midst of the Mexican War ? a war which was carried to a successful conclusion only by Southern energy and effort . The building of these two lines throws an interesting light upon the character of the ante-bellum Southerners . They were not , as is evident , visionary and impractical men but compared favorably with their Northern brethren in business acumen and enterprise .                   @ @
