Among this month 's publications by the Macmillan Company are " Outline of Applied Sociology , " by Henry Pratt Fairchild , and " Public Health Nursing , " by Mary S. Gardner . The following volumes are announced for publication on January 3 by Little , Brown &; Company : " The Hillman , " by E. Phillips Oppenheim ; " The Unwelcome Man , " by Waldo Frank , and " The Twenty-four , " by the late George Fitch . For publication early in the new year Henry Holt &; Co. announce : " Daybreak " ( originally announced as " Victory " ) , the completion of " Pelle the Conqueror , " by Nexo ; " The Andes of Southern Peru , " by Isaiah Rowman , and " The Girl , " by Katherine Keith . Whoever picks up the two latest volumes in the Art and Craft of Letters series ( Doran ; 40 cents net each ) , Barry Pain on " The Short Story , " and John Drinkwater on " The Lyric , " in the expectation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literature , will be disappointed . Barry Pain , who can himself write excellent short stories , merely offers his own reactions to various of the great short-story writers , and ends upon a vindictive note of distaste for the Russians , and a dithyrambic note of praise for Henry James and George Meredith . So far is he from giving an aperen of most of the field that he mentionsbut one American besides James ? Poe  --  and gives him but three or four condescending words ; and he says nothing of the short stories or tales of Scott , Mrs. Gaskell , Anthony Trollope , Stevenson , Gissing , Arnold Bennett , or of a dozen others we might mention . Yet his essay is ostensibly historical rather than anything else , tracing the short story from Marryat to Conrad , and he tells nothing more of theartistic requirements of the form than that it must , from its compression , be richer in suggestion than any other prose ! Sohn Drinkwater appears unable to orient himself in his broad field , and is content to smash a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coleridge 's definition of Poetry as " the best words in the best order " ; and having exhausted half hiS space in thus clearing the ground , proceeds to tell us that the familiar statement that a lyric is the expression of personal emotion means nothing , inasmuch as all poetry is this , and to use the rest of his essay in showing the fundamental points of likeness among lyric , epic , dramatic , and narrative poetry , among Shakespeare , Wither , Keats , and Suckling . Much of this is quite sound , and he strikes out several happy epigrams , but at bottom he devotes a paper upon one form of poetry to showing that essential poetry can not be divided into forms . Essentially , Mark Van Doren 's " Henry David Thoreau " ( Houghton Mifflin ; $1 25 net ) is an amplification of one of the Shelburne essays of Paul E. More . " Thoreau 's most discriminating critic , " as Mr. Van Doren calls Mr More , has thrown into relief the resemblances between Thoreau and the German romanticists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resemblance  --  the doctrine of expansion  --  has been made central in the interpretation of Thoreau . An important part of Mr. More 's view has , unfortunately , been lopped off ; the view that Nature was , for Thoreau , a " discipline of the will , " and not only a stimulation to the imagination , has been modified nearly to annihilation . One may well question ? however , the validity of the assumption that Arnold 's thre &-fourths; of life was a cipher in the case of Thoreau . To Mr. Van Doren , Thoreau is in the main " an expansive bore , " with a saving " genius for the specific . " His error was that he deliberately inhabited a vacuum , and not the " great and common world " of Plato and Shakespeare  --  this is true enough , though happily there were compensations winch Mr. Van Doren makes too little of . For solid , demolishing criticism of Thoreau , one will look in vain for anything more effective than the present volume ; Lowell 's spirited attack is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end one can not help wondering why Thoreau should have so impressive a following , why , for example , the American public may be counted on to include " Walden " in such lists as the recent " hundred most popular books " selected from Everyman 's Library , if he is not more deserving of esteem . than Mr. Van Doren conceives him . Outspoken praise he reserves for the last three or four pages of his book , and then he is scarcely satisfactory . Few writers have been more foolishly praised than Thoreau , and we are naturally grateful for a sober and philosophical critical study of him , but this study is not what it might have been , a sympathetic , discriminating , well-rounded interpretation . The little that is said of Thoreau 's relation to Nature , for one thing , is quite inadequate . " Thoreau 's idea of the friendly relation demanded complete sympathy and toleration from the second party .

We have received the October-December issue of the Bulletin of the John Rylands Library ( Manchester ) , a quarterly sold for the trifling sum of sixpence . Recent numbers have contained studies of such recondite subjects as the origin of the cult of Dionysos and Kurfinic manuscripts . The present number , however , is enlivened by a paper of very general interest . Prof. T. F. Tout , of the University of Manchester , writes engagingly of " A Medimval Burglary . " It is true that he did not set out to make an investigation of this unusual subject , but we are nevertheless thankful that the details of the incident were encountered while he was seeking for light on the technicalities of the history of the King 's Wardrobe . This historical burglary of the royal treasury took place in the year 1303 , within the sacred precincts of Westminster Abbey , and the story is well worth the telling , especially by so facile a pen . Professor Tout finds occasion to speak briefly of the finances of England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war , as now Kings are at war , and imposed taxes which would to-day astound even the most violent militarist . The clergy , who were not expected to fight , bore the heaviest rate of taxation ; and it is said that the Dean of St. Paul 's fell dead on the spot when he learned of the unprecedented impost  --  the equivalent of an income tax of ten . shillings in the pound . ( In these days of much talk about military preparedness , a profitable lesson can be drawn from the poor dean 's unhappy fate ! ) The Bulletin contains much bibliographical matter , including the third list of books collected by the John Rylands Library as a contribution to the new library of the University of Louvain . " Railway Regulation , " by I. L. Sharfman , is one of a series of texts prepared for a course in business administration conducted by the La Salle Extension University ( Chicago ) . Neither in subject matter nor in method of treatment does it reveal any originality . It relies to a considerable degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and its point of view is the one generally accepted by students of the subject . Its brevity necessitates summary treatment of the many topics introduced , and hence renders it unsatisfactory for any one who desires to study exhaustively any phase of railway regulation . Yet , for the reader who desires an outline of the history and problems of railway control in the United States , this book may be commended as a well-arranged , well-balanced , and well-written handbook on the subject , When Archdeacon Cunningham was in this country in the autumn of 1914 he delivered half a dozen lectures on a variety of subjects ? townships , architecture , colleges , the function of the state in modern society . Through all the lectures , however , ran a common thread by which the distinguished economic historian of England sought to show some of the ties which have connected America with her Anglo-Saxon mother . Those who heard him will be glad that his lectures have been gathered together in a volume with the appropriate title , " English Influence on the United States " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance , the rectangular arrangement of American city streets as at Philadelphia to the reforming influence of Christopher Wren in London after the Great Fire of 1666 and the use of a dome , as at the State House at Annapolis or Boston , through St. Pahl 's Cathedral in London to St. Sophia at Constantinople . Notable , though not novel , is his discussion of the strong influence of the Scotch universities upon American colleges in general and Princeton in particular . The seventeenth volume of the Publications of the Colonial Society of Massachusetts contains the usual variety of valuable contributions by its members , including four communications from its editor , Albert Matthews , which occupy no less than 250 of the 409 Doges . The longest of these articles contains notes on the Massachusetts Royal Commissions , and is , therefore , a supplement to the second volume of the Society 's publications in which the Commissions are printed . The next in length , that on " The Pilgrim Fathers , " was noticed in the Nation when it appeared last year as a separate issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Massachusetts , " by Professor Turner , of Harvard , and a " Continuation of the Diary of George Washington , " covering two of Washington 's years of retirement at Mt . Vernon , 1785-1786 . Distinctly the most human document in the volume is the communication by Andrew McFarland Davis on the " Editorship of the Massachusetts Province Laws , " in which are set forth some of the difficulties that confront the scholar who is compelled to work under legislative supervision . The Peculiarities of the late editor of the laws , Abner C. Goodell , did much to injure the cause of official publication , by the State of Massachusetts , of its historical records , and we fear that further issue of these records , particularly of the proceedings of the Assembly and the Council , is likely to be indefinitely postponed , a fact much to be regretted by historical scholars . In 1894 the late William Nelson began , but unfortunately never completed , his " History of American Newspapers " ( printed in New Jersey Archives , Vols . XI , XII , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ published a " Check-List of Boston Newspapers , 1704-1780 . " In 1910 the Illinois State Historical Society published " Newspapers and Periodicals of Illinois , 1814-1879 . " And in 1913 the American Antiquarian Society began to publish , but has not yet completed , a " Bibliography of American Newspapers , 1690-1820 . " These are no doubt the most elaborate checklists of newspapers ever attempted in this country , since in each the collections of many libraries are listed ; but , owing to the labor and expense involved , it is not likely that many other societies will print similar lists . In 1898 , however , the State Historical Society of Wisconsin published a check-list of newspapers found in its own library only , a second edition appearing in 1911 ; and this laudable example was followed by the Library of Congress in 1901 and 1912 , by the Department of Archives and History of the State of Alabama in 1904 , by the New York Public Library in 1915 , and now by the Yale University Library ? " A List of Newspapers in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Vol . II ( Yale University Press ; $3 ) . After an interval of thirty years , a new edition , " substantially unchanged , " has appeared of Miss Isabel Florence Hapgood 's " Epic Songs of Russia , " with an appreciative introductory note by Prof. J. W. Mackail ( Scribner , $1.50 net ) . This volume has won just praise as the only collection in English of the Russian byliny . Of these it contains forty , in readable English prose translations , thus giving a sufficient notion of the content of this interesting branch of popular literature . The method throughout is dilettante , not critical ; no exact indications are given of the sources of the texts , and the introduction and appendix will by no means satisfy serious students of folk-lore . The first volume of a series on the religious life of India offered by the Oxford Press is " The Village Gods of South India , " by the Right Rev. Henry Whitehead , Bishop of Madras . The new series has all the advantages of scope and compass ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in small , convenient volumes . Not the least interesting phenomenon is that where Hindus and Mohammedans have for so long been contiguous they have adopted and assimilated from each other . Thus the diversity of cult and practice to be found in India 's great religions has ever baffled students , while the degree to which so many of the leading cults of Hinduism have degenerated has long been a matter of concern to the more progressive adherents of that faith , and has inspired the formation of reform societies . The subject of Bishop Whitehead 's study is not only a popular but a necessary one in the series . The amazing variety of ritual and ceremonial that is practiced under ' the all-absorbing Hinduism must continue to engross students , for its full history will not be available for years to come , until ethnologists have delved more deeply into the welter of tribes and races , large and small , that have managed to preserve vestiges of atavistic resemblance in physiognomy and custom wherever they happen to have found their ultimate settlement . And chief among these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to-day under the religion of the conquering Aryan , even to the extent of largely influencing and moulding it . It is in the south of India , where the Dravidian and other primitive races were driven by the successive invaders , that the true history of India , ethnological and religious , remains to be uncovered . The rare surviving data are epigraphic and of uncertain provenance , so that it is through the more or less integral religious life and custom of the various races that a coherent beginning is to be made . Bishop Whitehead 's see embraces this historic region of the ancient kingdoms of the south , and his suggestive chapters on Tamil , Telugu , and Canarese modes of worship hint at the existence of a wealth of material . This little book also contains some interesting illustrations of shrines typical of the improvisation peculiar to all these cults . A Glossary of Indian terms , a list of gods , male and female , and a geographical index to the ethnological divisions , all provided with diacritical marks , promise well for the series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and New Testaments began in its first year , 1816-17 , at 6,410 , and in its ninety-ninth year , 1914-15 , stood at 6,406,323 . The increase has been rapid in the last ten years ; in the last three of its century , an advance of a million annually . War , it seems , stimulates the output . With our Civil War , the issues leaped for the first time into the million , and almost into the second ; in fact , the level at the close of that : war was not reached again for twenty years . The output of complete Bibles , though fluctuating- sharply , has since 1878 remained usually below 400 , - 000 , so that the issue is , in its increase , becoming more and more preponderantly an issue of testaments and " portions " alone . One reason for this is probably to be found in the growing list of translations . The languages and dialects represented now number 164 , not including issues for the blind ; and translation , naturally , begins with one or more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been the King James version of 1611 , and its revisions in 1881 , 1885 , and 1901 . Other texts , which are required to conform to these British and American versions " in the principle of their translation , " have , with some early exceptions , been made out of the original tongues . In the Society 's " Centennial History " ( Macmillan ; 2 vols .. ; $2 ) , Dr. H. 0 . Dwight naturally does not tarry over question of sources . It may be noted that , following a considerable use of the Scio ( Spanish ) version , the policy finally adopted in 1841 of excluding the Vulgate ( now in course of rescension under Gasquet ) , and its derivatives and the earlier decision in 1827 , following that of the British society , to narrow Reformation canons by expunging the apocrypha outright , have combined with the Roman Catholic policy , when maintained , of discouraging lay reading to restrict , probably for all time , the amazing vigor of a splendid enterprise to the service of the Protestant churches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time an answering Roman activity , as in the French Testament of 1872 , the Japanese Gospels , 1898 , and more recently the issue of portions of the New Testament in Brazil . If it has not been possible to serve all Christendom , the work has been world-wide , the Society has stood in the front rank of the many national societies of its kind , and within the bodies which Dr. Dwight calls the " Evangelical Church " its progress has , with one exception , been unhampered by any sectarian difficulties . The dispute which arose in 1836 over the translation of the Greek word gasritcd led to the founding of the American and Foreign Bible Society , a separate Baptist organization . Bearing in mind the prodigious mass of detail which Dr. Dwight has had to marshal into statement , it may seem unappreciative to cavil at the character of the resulting record . No objection can be taken to the author 's pervasive interest in making the account " edifying , " in the apostolic sense of the word . The historian is frankly not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has chosen to present his hundred years , not in a history , but in annals . The mere repetition that results brings some of the development to light , as , for instance , the first growth out of local auxiliary societies , the progress to growth by auxiliaries , the shifting of vitality into the district superintendents , and , finally , the complete breakdown of the auxiliary system , and the almost complete centralization of the work of distribution But clarifying generalization is lacking for the most part , and the " general reader " for whom the book is intended , though led through many an interesting incident and biographic glimpse , will , if he manages to read the record through , be all too likely to carry away an undeservedly blurred impression of the Society 's experience and achievement .
