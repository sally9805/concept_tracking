txt District Attorney J. D. Fredericks of Los Angeles , who prosecuted the brothers , now in St. Quentin Prison , is now in New York , working on certain details of the larger dynamiting inquiry , which he says involves more than 100 separate cases , a positive record of which is now in the possession of the officers of the law . When a TIMES reporter asked him at his room in the Hotel Astor where the clues now being followed would lead , he said : " Newspaper men are my friends . They have been fair with me . They have helped me . But to talk to them now is to talk to the ? other fellow , ' for the ' other fellow ' reads what is written every day , and lie reads cleverly between the lines . My message to the people just now is simply this : the trail is an open one , and we are following it without any difficulty . " We know where it will lead , but we can not now state this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the end of the trail will have to pay the penalty of his mistakes . Some day , when this thing is all over and the people realize its magnitude , I am going to get hold of some good , clear-headed newspaper man whom I know to be open minded and able to write plainly , and tell him how it was done . The real story has never been told . It has hardly even been guessed . " An idea of the strain under which Mr. Fredericks works may be appreciated from this Incident . When THE TIMES reporter khocked at his door he called Come in . " He sat at a desk at the far end of the room , anu was watching the door . He is a tall man with rugged features , and every line of him denotes great physical strength . One long arm rested carelessly on the writing desk , and a. big hand sprawled over a sheet of typewriting PaPer , beneath which could be seen the outline oCa revolver . " What is it , a thirty-two or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty-eight ; ibut please let 's have none of that . I hate such things , they look dramatic . But more than once now it has been a question of life and death with me , and I never know how IL is going to work out . " It was learned that only yesterday morning he was accosted by a man in the Subway , who tried to pick a quarrel with him . Mr. Fredericks told something of the detail with which the dynamiting cases have been built up . He has a book of signatures of the brothers , which consists of more than 500 pictures of signatures on hotel registers , of express receipts , manuscript visiting cards , freight orders , and penciled memoranda . On one page of the- book appears J. B. Bryce , J. B. , J. B. Smith , S. J. Miller , F. Miller , Frank Sullivan , and Frank Caldwell , all written by J. B. . It was the letter ' S ' which made this work easy for us. " said Mr. Fredericks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all cases . " One picture is that of an American Express receipt from Milwaukee to a far Western city , bearing the signature of J. B. , a receipt for dynamite . Another is an enlargement of a little visiting card , upon which chemicals were used to bring to light the faded pencil lines of the inscription , " Ask for Bryce . " Bryce was the name used by at San Francisco , when he bought the dynamite with which the Times Building was eventually destroyed . In this book is a fac simile of practically every code wire sent by the men at work In the conspiracy . One thing brought out clearly in the interview with the Prosecutor was hi 's loyalty to honest labor 's cause . Laboring men , he says , had been bitterly misled . They simply elected officers of their organizations , voted upon them , and then went on with their work . He does not regard the acts of violence which have been uncovered as in any sense an expression of labor 's views . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " It was a battle for the supremacy of the law . If I we ca n't have that we 're down and out . The rank and file of labor is honest , fair , and square and manly . But many of the men in power were out-and-out criminals . It is positively a sad thing that this terrible calamity should have hit honest men . "
