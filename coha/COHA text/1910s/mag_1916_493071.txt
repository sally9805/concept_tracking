COMING away the other day from a long discussion with a very able Pole , I found my mind , by a process of reaction , turning from the details which we had considered to cer ? tain fundamental and theoretical questions . We had talked of populations in percentages , of the conflicting interests of Germany , Austria and Russia , of kings and constitutions , of parties and their divergent calculations . The Pole was a rich mine of uncensored knowledge , and some of his information , as he argued for the solution of his national question by independence , had been startling and illuminating . But after parting from him , I found myself conducting with his echo one of those Socratic dialogues which are so enor ? mously effective in the absence of the other party . Independence is a relative term . Before one decides that Poland ought to have or can have in ? dependence , one must know what kind of Europe will be her environment . If it is to be the Europe we have known in the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of allied groups and the armed peace , then independence for Poland is a ludicrous impossibility . Assume for a moment that all the twenty millions of Poles can be united , that their national state can freely frame its own constitution and elect its own monarchical or republican chief , that it obtains its outlet to the sea by the creation of a free port at Danzig , even then its independence would be noth ? ing but a name . No ingenuity can bestow upon it natural or easily defensible boundaries , and all the new science of trench warfare would fail to enable it to secure itself by its own man-power against the three great empires which surround it . It must attach itself to one group or the other . The ne ? cessity of protecting one or two of its three fronts by contracting a permanent military alliance with one or two of its great neighbors is obvious , and it entails large political consequences . Its ally or allies will want guaranties for the permanence of the connection . Too weak to defend themselves alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important balancing factor in the distribution of military power in Europe . Any doubt as to which camp included them would be for all their neigh ? bors a source of intolerable unrest . This means , I think , that in such a Europe they will never he quite free to appoint their own king or to conduct their own diplomatic , military or trade policy . They will be at the best if not ex ? actly a vassal state , then certainly a fettered ally within the group which they ultimately join . Realindependence , in the sense that they could choose their own sovereign , conduct their own diplomatic policy and dispose at will of their military power , would imply a condition of Europe in which mili ? tary power itself had become a matter of indif ? ference to their neighbors . Idealists and neutrals may consider Polish preferences and the future of Polish culture . The belligerent Powers will con ? sider chiefly the two million Polish bayonets which have to be assigned to one of the two camps , or distributed between them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independence . The choice ( in so far as the Poles can choose at all ) is complicated . On the one hand the Cen tral Powers have revived the forbidden word , independence . " They have resurrected the Polish kingdom , and made , merely by that word , a powerful appeal to the sentiment of a race which has lived on memory and hope . It is true that whatever the limits of this kingdom may he , it will not at the best include all the home-lands of the Poles , and at the worst it may contain only the half . The Pole who has witnessed one miracle is ready , however , to expect another . Give him a " Piedmont , " and he thinks he can recover the rest of his heritage . He is not anxious about Galicia . It enjoyed a satisfactory measure of autonomy in the past , and it has been promised some further improvement in its status for the future . He argues that even the German Poles must profit by the change . Hitherto , the German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Warsaw and Posen was not unfavorable to itself . If the German Pole enjoyed no better security for his national rights than the Russian Pole , and had to complain in addition of the really barbarous policy of colonization , he enjoyed on the other hand a higher level of material prosperity , better facilities for education , and securer civil rights . But if Warsaw is destined to happiness , it follows that something must be done to improve the lot of Posen . So much the German Radicals at least per ? ceive , and promise their Poles a generous share in the benefits of the " new orientation . " The abler Poles have no illusions about the meaning of the " independence " they will enjoy . But they argue that it will fetter only their ex ? ternal policy . At home they will be free to create a national Polish state , and to a Russian Pole who was not free even to found an elementary school in his native village , the restriction on his liberty of choice in the sphere of high politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promises on the other hand to unite the three frag ? ments of the divided race . That , however , de ? pends on the incalculable military event , and on a Russian victory so complete as this , few Poles who have seen both armies at close quarters dare reckon to-day . Assume , however , that the reunion is an accomplished fact , the question then arises , what kind of " autonomy " the Russians are likely to confer . They have never defined it . They are divided into two schools , of which one would give full home rule , and the other no more than local government by towns and counties , without a legislature . The latter school is still ? or was till yesterday ? in the ascendant . Confidence would be easier , were it not that the Poles remember the withdrawal after fifteen years of the autonomy , never fully applied , which they once enjoyed , and that they ponder on the more recent experience of Finland . It is obvious that if the military position on the eastern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the statemanship which each side displays in handling the Poles may be a de ? cisive factor . So far the Russians have hardly faced this aspect of the question at all , and indeed the recent circular of the Ministry of the Interior , which accused the Poles of going over bodily to the Austrian camp , seemed to renounce any idea of making a bid for their support . The bid , if ever it is effectively made , will be dangerously be ? lated . The Germans , on the other hand , since they valued and needed the military support of the Poles , have gone to work methodically . They in ? vited the people of Russian Poland to nominate a commission to negotiate with them . It was chosen from the existing Polish organizations , some edu ? cational , some philanthropic , some commercial and some municipal . Care was taken to include no one whose " stake in the country " as a landowner would make it difficult for him to be independent . The commission of seven was invited to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take place at Warsaw : it would go to Berlin only if and when it had reached a satisfactory settle ? ment . It has gone to Berlin . The inference seems clear that on paper at least the outline of the Polish kingdom is relatively promising . My Polish informant did not despair even of the in ? clusion in it of some districts of German Posen ? those in which the Polish element in the population is sixty - five per cent . The average in Posen as a whole is only fifty - five per cent , but some frontier districts might be ceded under this condition . In regard to Austrian Galicia there is an excit ? ing speculative possibility . The Austrian Emperor has conceded to it some higher status . This may conceivably mean that Galici i will become formally a kingdom , united by a personal union to the Hapsburg crown . In that case some Poles have an interesting strategy under consideration . If the new Austro-German Kingdom of Poland were to elect as its hereditary king no less a person than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be achieved to the extent of two-thirds at least . Galicia and Warsaw would then amalgamate to form the third Kingdom under the Hapsburg rule . They would be tied , to be sure , to the Central Empires in their external policy , but their internal life would be as independent as that of Hungary . No solution under the exclu ? sive protection of either of the two European groups can promise them a higher degree of in ? dependence than this . At the first glance the Entente is bound to com ? bat any solution of the Polish problem under Austro-German auspices . It may follow one of two courses . It may simply rally to the Russian solution , and this is what Mr. Asquith and M. Briand have already done . One hopes that in re ? turn , some conditions have been laid down as to the meaning of the promised " autonomy . " The other course would have been to adopt the idea of a Polish Kingdom , to insist that all Powers shall guarantee it , and to use the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wider extent and a larger independence than the Germans and Austrians purpose . That would have been the liberal and statesmanlike course , but it would have required the assent of Petrograd . One need not assume that it is vetoed for ever . What must be said to-day is not necessarily what will be said when the day of settlement comes . The dilemma is for the Entente peculiarly delicate . On the one hand there are few , if any , Englishmen or French ? men who would choose to fight in order to oppose the idea of a Polish kingdom . On the other hand to consent to any solution which permanently in ? creases the military strength of the Central Em ? pires is nearly impossible in the present condition of Europe . The dilemma is not to-day as sharp as it may become . The Polish Kingdom is as yet a mere phrase , and it is easy to argue , as most of our press does , that there will be no moral reality in this promised independence . If , however , the Poles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kingdom materializes as a genuine national state , and , above all , if Russian affairs remain in the hands of the present bureaucratic group , the idea of fighting on to ensure a Russian conquest of Poland would maintain itself in the west with difficulty . There are two ways of escape from this dilemma . The first and the chief of them lies in the resolve that the new Europe shall not resemble the old . If we can realize the league of nations , if we can consign competing armaments and the struggle of the balanced Powers to the hideous past , then it need not be for us a matter of the first importance that the Poles should belong in a military sense to the Central Powers . If we can at all conceive this reformed and reorganized Europe , we shall cease to think primarily and in ? stinctively in terms of military power . The other way of escape would open before us , if our assent to a solution which seemed to ensure Polish liberty with some approach to reunion could he set off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If the French-speaking districts of Lorraine were re ? stored to France , and the Italian Trentino to Italy , if the Armenian Vilavets were placed under Russian rule and the Turkish straits neutralized , if finally the Hapsburgs , at the moment when they received the Polish crown , would also remodel the Dual Monarchy on a federal basis , with a fullpromise of liberty to the Czechs , the South Slays and the Roumans within it , there would be small reason to regret that the Poles were enjoying freedom " in the other camp . " It is of course the corollary of such a settlement that it should recog ? nize Germany 's claim to economic expansion in Turkey and Africa . In a Europe thus rearranged , we should soon cease to think of " camps . " Does such a scheme as this make too heavy a draft on the tolerance and goodwill of warring nations ? Perhaps it does . But the logic of military events moves in the direction of a negotiated peace . Such a series of changes could disappoint nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they went to war . In the early months of 1914 the realization of such a program as this would have seemed to most of us an approach to the millen ? nium . ? IT can never be too thoroughly emphasized that the founders of the American Constitution did not intend to create a complete system of government . They took the states for granted , and it was upon their complex foundation that they attempted to build . What they attempted was essentially its supplement , the binding together of certain strands which the withdrawal of British sovereignty had grievously untied . Yet , as the event was to show , it was no easy matter to achieve a working efficiency for the new instrument of sovereign power . If we can say to-day that the interests of the American nation are supreme , and that the old states ' rights theory of sovereignty is largely obsolete , we have to remember that a Civil War was needed to give it its death-blow . For the Constitution was doubtfully imposed and regretfully accepted . Men found it difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work towards a similar end . They imagined that coordination meant antithesis , and drew a distinction between state and nation . An ? tagonism not unnaturally resulted ; for where men believe there is enmity , its appearance may with certainty be predicted . In the result we may utter our requiescat over the grave of localism . Nationalism , then , is triumphant . The natural question any statute must now raise is not whether Missouri or Alabama will benefit from its en ? actment , but whether the United States will so benefit . But there is another aspect of this unified sovereignty about which certain doubts may be ex-pressed . It stands for centralization ; that is to say it changes the whole character of the federal idea . It may be , indeed , that this centralization is essential to the future of the United States . It may be that until the power of the latter under ? goes a further concentration , it can never ade ? quately be exercised . The interests of the whole may so uniquely transcend the interests of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ validity . Yet even an observer handicapped , as I am , by an alien tradition , can not help but , realize that there is in America a certain fundamental disunity of circumstance . When I am in Kansas , I know that I am not in New York . The problems , even the thoughts and the desires , are different and affect people differently . Is it wise to make Washington a kind of Hegelian harmonization of these dif ? ferences and say that Congress can transcend them in a federal statute ? In the result , as every states ? man must know , what are called the " interests of the Republic " in New York will probably be called " discrimination against the Middle West " in Kansas . And that is intelligible , even if it is rarely praiseworthy . For while action in Kansas would have attempted to cope with the difficulties of the Middle West , action at ' Washington aims ? since a balance of interests must be struck ? at their genial evasion . Surely this suggests the existence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The growth of national government , with the consequent strengthening of its sovereign character ,
