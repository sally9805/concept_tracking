Every one in the apartment house liked and respected her , but she kept very much . to herself . " Manager Koch was considerably con-cerned. because he did not know the address of the girl 's parents and because he understood that the Millers were going . to deny that they knew who the girl was and were going to allow her to be buried in Potter 's Ffeld .
