 | SO far as I have power to influence the direction of the Socialist campaign this year , I lay the emphasis upon the plain tendency of the American capitalist class toward militarism . That American capitalists and their servants in office deny the existence of such a tendency is to be expected . I believe the Kaiser , as the representative of the great German capitalists , still insists there is no militarism in Germany . It is my understanding that opponents of militarism need not wait to attack it until its backers make open confession . Acts sometimes speak more loudly than words . President Wilson says he is opposed to militarism . But what has he done ? He has used his power to force thru Congress the greatest military appropriations that any nation ever made in time of peace . When the nations of Europe were pulling themselves together for war , not one of them made such appropriations as the American government has just made . Even Germany 's appropriations for the second fiscal year preceding the war seem small in comparison . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the exception of those pertaining to Austria-Hungary , are from the last number of the United States Naval Yearbook . The army figures and Austria-Hungary 's naval figures are reproduced from official figures reprinted in the World Almanacs for 1914 and 1915 . The facts about the Wilson military appropriations are worthy of particular consideration . One is that they are far and away greater than any other nation ever made in time of peace . The other is that Republicans criticize them because they are too small . I am aware that the pretense is made that these appropriations are for three years . This is a " three year program . " The inference is that there will be no more appropriations for two years . That is what the uninformed are expected to think while they are paying the bills in the form of higher living costs . I by no means regard this as a " three-year program " in any such sense . I have long observed these gentlemen at work . I well remember how Mr. Schwab , in 1896 , endeavored to wheedle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his goods on the ground that he had created special plants to produce them which would soon be useless for the reason that the navy , " in ten years , would be completed " ! I know there is no such thing as " completing " a navy that is competing in size with other navies . I know there is no such thing as satisfying a naval officer that the navy with which he is connected is large enough . I know the pQlicy of the militarists is to get as much as they can whenever they can and always to ask for more . Our navy is already so large that about $140,000,000 is required annually for maintenance . We shall have to have another appropriation next year for that . Additional ships will increase the cost of maintenance . We shall have to appropriate money for the increase . Furthermore , our militarists will next year discover that , while we have made a fine start toward " protecting " the nation , we sadly need so many more dreadnoughts , so many more battle cruisers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be asked .  | This is not mere idle prophecy . It is projecting the history of the past into the future . It is based upon the way our militarists work . BUT the unparalleled number of millions that the Wilson administration and the Democratic Congress have appropriated for military purposes ? these millions by no means constitute the only signs of militarism . The military laws of the State of New York constitute another sign . They were enacted last spring without notice and without public demand during the last hours of a dying legislature . The Governor now has power to draft , at any moment , any and every male citizen of military age . Under the guise of " physical training , " military drills are enforced upon school children , while boys between the ages of sixteen and nineteen are to be given training that is acknowledged to be of a military nature . A Republican legislature and a Republican Governor enacted these laws , but a Democratic President , when he came to write his party 's platform in July , uttered no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 he had approved a bill under the terms of which he , himself , took the power arbitrarily to draft citizens of the United States into the Federalized militia . The bill to which Z refer is the so-called HayChamberlain Army Reorganization bill . The draft provision is in Section 79 . At first the bill was made to read that when battalions of the national guard should be sent away on service , reserve battalions should be formed and that the President should have power to " call " enough citizens to create new battalions . This was the form in which the bill was first passed by the House . But the bill was sent to a conference committee and when it came out the word " call " had been changed to " draft . " The committee in which the change was made was composed of Senators Chamberlain of Oregon , Beckham of Kentucky , Broussard of Louisiana , Du Pont ( a powder peddler of Delaware ) and Representatives Hay of Virginia , Dent of Alabama and Kahn of California . Many members of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said they did not know " call " had been changed to " draft . " But the bill , with " draft " in it , was signed by the President . We Socialists take these matters seriously . We believe militarism is bad . We believe it is as bad in the United States as anywhere else , and we object to it more in the United States than anywhere else . We do not believe that life will be worth living or that civilization can endure if industry is to continue upon a basis of private ownership for private profit with its inevitable search for foreign markets in which to dispose of the goods that the workers can not buy because of insufficient income . The struggle for foreign markets gives rise to the necessity of fleets with which to " back up " aggressive diplomacy , and the necessity of paying bare living wages to enable one group of capitalists to compete with other groups that are also paying bare living wages , gives rise to the necessity of maintaining large armies . This is particularly true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other nations , a large army is needed neither for defense nor for the conquest of foreign markets . We Socialists most emphatically challenge the statement of American militarists that our great military appropriations are made for defense in any true sense of the word . We well know the purpose for which they are made . Our naval appropriations are made to enable American capitalists , after the European war , to hold the enormous foreign trade that Europe lost and American capitalists won as a result of the war . American capitalists have suddenly and unexpectedly come into possession of a large fraction of the world 's trade . From a nation that had no merchant marine , we are about to become the world 's second maritime nation . We are today building more merchant ships than any other nation . We are building these ships to carry the trade that Europe lost . And we are preparing to build 157 more warships , because we know that Europe , after the war , will try to recover her trade , and our capitalists mean to hold it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of attack that American capitalists fear and against which they are preparing . WE Socialists are violently opposed to the buying of foreign trade at such a price . We are opposed to foreign trade at any price that means simply the selling abroad for private profit of goods made by American workers that they were unable to buy because of the difference between their wages and the value of their product . But we are particularly opposed to foreign trade for private profit when it means ( as it now does ) not only the exploitation of the workers , but the placing of their lives in jeopardy to maintain , by a show of armed force , American capitalists ' foreign trade . We assert that the history of no nation may be cited as proof that foreign trade brings more than a bare living to the workers . Great Britain leads the world in foreign trade , but the rapacity of the British capitalist has brought about even the physical deterioration of the worker . We Socialists also assert that America , if it would , can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . We are the richest nation in the world , but we are not richer than all the other nations , or even richer than the nations of Europe . The more foreign trade we might get , the more we should be hated by our nearest rivals , and sooner or later a military combination would be made among them that would first impoverish us to keep up with them and eventually lead to our conquest . We Socialists warn the nation of these perils . We challenge the statement of President Wilson that militarism is not here because , notwithstanding our great military appropriations , there is no desire in America to attack others . We know the people of America are peaceful . We know the peoples of Europe were peaceful . But we also know the European war is of economic origin ; we know there were capitalists in Europe who preferred war to the sacrifice of what they regarded as their interests , and we believe there are great capitalists in America who would prefer war to the sacrifice of their interests . SOCIALISTS also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ending the industrial depression until the European war dumped so many billions of gold into the country that business had to revive ; that such " prosperity " as we now have , while it means hundreds of millions to the capitalist class , means only more work for the workers for wages that , however " high , " are only as high as the cost of living ; that the average railway profit of $4100 a mile went to 607,630 stockholders who represent but six-tenths of one per cent of the population ; that the profits of other corporations are similarly absorbed ; that the increase , since 1913 , of $41,000,000 in the national wealth still leaves the workers upon farms and in factories with no prospect for the morrow but more work for a bare living , and that what this nation needs is not a great foreign trade , but such economic arrangements as shall enable productive workers to consume the full value of their own products . In short , Socialists , this year as always , advocate public ownership and democratic management of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? public ownership of the Government .
