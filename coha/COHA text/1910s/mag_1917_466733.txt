IN 1884 Mark Twain had abandoned the Republican party to vote for Cleveland . He believed the party had become corrupt , and to his last day it was hard for him to see anything good in Republi-can politics or performance . He pinned his faith to no party , for he knew too well the doubtful phases of office-seeking and office-holding , and the shortcomings of his race . A letter to Twichell , written when Mark Twain was approaching seventy , takes up politics and humanity in general in a manner complimentary to neither . Mark Twain was never really a pessimist , but he had pessimistic inter-vals , such as come to most of us in life 's later years , and at such times he let himself go without stint concerning " the damned human race , " as he called it , usually with a manifest sense of indignation that he should be a member of it . In much of his later writing ? A Mysterious &ranger,; for example ? he said his say with but small restraint ; and certainly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pessimist of the most extreme type , capably damning the race and the inventor of it . Yet at heart no man loved his kind more genuinely or with deeper compassion than i Mark Twain , perhaps for its very weaknesses . It was only that he had inter-vals ? frequent intervals , and rather long i ones ? when he did not admire it , and was still more doubtful as to the ways of Providence . To Rev. J. H. Twichell , in Hartford : March 14 , ' 55 . DEAR JoE , ? I have a Pudd'nhead maxim : " When a man is a pessimist before 48 he knows too much ; if he is an optimist after it , lie knows too little . " It is with contentment , therefore , that I reflect that I am better and wiser than you . Joe , you seem to be dealing in " bulks , " now ; the " bulk " of the farmers and U. S. Senators are " honest . " As regards purchase and sale with money ? Who doubts it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't there a dozen kinds of honesty which ca n't be measured by the money-standard ? Treason is treason ? and there 's more than one form of it ; the money-form is but one of them . When a person is disloyal to any confessed duty , he is plainly and simply dishonest , and knows it ; knows it , and is privately troubled about it and not proud of himself . Judged by this standard ? and who will challenge the validity of it ? ? there is n't an honest man in Connecticut , nor in the Senate , nor anywhere else . I do not even except myself , this time . Am I finding fault with you and the rest of the populace ? No ? I assure you I am not . For I know the human race 's limitations , and this makes it my duty ? my pleasant duty ? to be fair to it . Each person an it is honest in one or several ways , but no member of it is honest in all the ways required by ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , as I look at it , there is no obligation upon him . Am I honest ? I give you my word of honor ( private ) I am not . For seven years I have suppressed a book which my conscience tells me I ought to publish . I hold it a duty to publish it . There are other difficult duties which I am equal to , but I am not equal to that one . Yes , even I am dishonest . Not in many ways , but in some . Forty-one , I think it is . We are certainly all honest in one or several ways ? every man in the world ? though 1 have reason to think I am the only one whose black-list runs so light . Sometimes I feel lonely enough in this lofty solitude . of the kingdom of God and righteousness . " " From age to age " ? yes , it describes that giddy gait . I ( and the rocks ) will not live to see it arrive , but that is all right ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought not to be always ironically apologizing for the Deity . If that thing is going to arrive , it is inferable that He wants it to arrive ; and so it is not quite kind of you , and it hurts me , to see you flinging sarcasms at the gait of it . And yet it would not be fair in me not to admit that the sarcasms are deserved . When the Deity wants a thing , and after working at it for " ages and ages " ca n't show even a shade of progress toward its accomplishment , we ? well , we do n't laugh , but it is only because we das n't . The source of " righteousness " ? is in the heart ? Yes . And engineered and directed by the brain ? Yes . Well , history and tradition testify that the heart is just about what it was in the beginning ; it has undergone no shade of change . Its good and evil impulses and their consequences are the same to-day that they were in Old Bible times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Middle Age times , in Twentieth Century times . There has been no change . Meantime , the brain has undergone no change . It is what it always was . There are a few good brains and a multitude of poor ones . It was so in Old Bible times and in all other times ? Greek , Roman , Middle Ages and Twentieth Century . Among the savages ? all the savages ? the average brain is as competent as the average brain here or elsewhere . I will prove it to you , some time , if you like . And there are great brains among them , too . I will prove that also , if you like . Well , the 19th century made progress ? the first progress after " ages and ages " ? colossal progress . In what ? Materialities . Prodigious acquisitions were made in things which add to the comfort of many and make life harder for as many more . But the addition to righteousness ? Is that discoverable ? I think not . The materialities were not invented in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world because of them than there was before , is hardly demonstrable , I think . in Europe and America there is a vast change ( due to them ) in ideals ? do you admire it ? All Europe and all America are feverishly scrambling for money . Money is the supreme ideal ? all others take tenth place with the great bulk of the nations named . Moneylust has always existed , but not in the history of the world was it ever a craze , a madness , until your time and mine . This lust has rotted these nations ; it has made them hard , sordid , ungentle , dishonest , oppressive . Did England use against the infamy of the Boxer war ? No ? rose in favor of it . Did America rise against the infamy of the Philippine war ? No ? rose in favor of it . Did Russia rise against the infamy of the present war ? No ? sat still and said nothing . Has the Kingdom of God advanced in Russia since the beginning of time ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step of the money-lust ? Or anywhere else ? If there has been any progress toward righteousness since the early days of Creation ? which , in my ineradicable honesty , I am obliged to doubt ? I think we must confine it to ten per cent of the populations of Christendom ( but leaving Russia , Spain and South America entirely out ) . This gives us 3zo,000,000 to draw the ten per cent from . That is to say , 32,000,000 have advanced toward righteousness and the Kingdom of God since the " ages and ages " have been flying along , the Deity sitting up there admiring . Well , you see it leaves 1,200,000,000 out of the race . They stand just where they have always stood ; there has been no change . N.B. No charge for these informations . Do come down soon , Joe . With love , MARK . There was always a run of reporters at Mark Twain 's New York home . His opinion was sought for on every matter of public interest , and whatever happened to him in particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copy , with his name as a catch-line at the top . When it was learned that he was to spend the summer in New Hampshire , the reporters had all wanted to find out about it . Again , when the summer was ending , they began to want to know how he had liked it , what work he had done , and what were his plans for another year . As they frequently applied to his publishers for these details , it was finally suggested to him that he write a letter furnishing the required information . Certain portions of his reply , handed to Mr. Duneka , of Harper &; Brothers , who was visiting him at the moment , are full of interest . Mem. for Mr. Duneka ; DUBLIN , Oct. 9 , 19 ) 5 . . . As to the other matters , here are the details . Yes , 1 have tried a number of summer homes , here and in Europe together . Each of these homes had charms of its own ; charms and delights of its own , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Several of them had conveniences , too . They all had a " view . " It is my conviction that there should always be some water in a view ? a lake or a river , but not the ocean , if you are down on its level . I think that when you are down on its level it seldom inflames you with an ecstasy which you could not get out of a sand-flat . It is like being on board ship , over again ; indeed it is worse than that , for there 's three months of it . On board ship one tires of the aspects in a couple of days , and quits looking . The same vast circle of heaving humps is spread around you all the time , with you in the centre of it and never gaining an inch on the horizon , so far as you can see ; for variety , a flight of flying-fish , mornings ; a flock of porpoises throwing summersaults , afternoons ; a remote whale spouting , Sundays ; occasional phosphorescent effects , nights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along under the horizon ; on the one single red-letter day , the illustrious iceberg . I have seen that iceberg thirty-four times in thirty-seven voyages ; it is always the same shape , it is always the same size , it always throws up the same old flash when the sun strikes it ; you may set it on any New York door-step of a June morning and light it up with a mirror ash ; and I will engage to recognize it . It is artificial , and it is provided and anchored out by the steamer companies . I used to like the sea , but I was young then , and could easily get excited over any kind of monotony , and keep it up till the monotonies ran out , if it was a fortnight . Last January , when we were beginning to inquire about a home for this summer , I remembered that Abbott Thayer had said , three years before , that the New Hampshire highlands was a good place .

I feel quite sure , in fact , that that is where it came from , I am ashamed to confess what an intolerable pile of manuscript I ground out in the 35 days , therefore I will keep the number of words to myself . I wrote the first half of a long tale ? " The Adventures of a Microbe " ? . and put it away for a finish next summer , and started another long tale ? ' The Mysterious Stranger .

I have not broken it , except to write " Eve 's Diary " and " A Horse 's Tale " ? short things occupying the mill I2 days . This year our summer is 6 months long and ends with November and the flight home to New York , but next year we hope and expect to stretch it another month and end it the first of December .

The series of letters which follows was prepared by Mark Twain and Gen. Fred Grant , mainly with a view of advertising the " farewell lecture , " which Clemens had agreed to deliver for the benefit of the Robert Fulton Monument ' This was a second version of the Mysterious Stranger . The first ( the one finally published ) was written in Vienna seven years before . Association . The association had really proposed to pay him a thousand dollars for it .

I mean the pay-platform ; I sha' n't retire from the gratis-platform until after I am dead and courtesy requires me to keep stilt and not disturb the others . What shall I talk about ? My idea is this : to instruct the audience about Robert Fulton , and . . . Tell me ? was that his real name , or was it his nom de plume ? However , never mind , it is not important ?

But never mind , do n't trouble Porter , I can establish them anyway . The way I look at it , they are historical gems ? gems of the very first water . Well , that is my idea , as I have said : first , excite the audience with a spoonful of information about Fulton , then quiet them down with a barrel of illustrations drawn by memory from my books ? and if you do n't say anything the house will think they never heard of it before , because people do n't . really read your books , they only say they do , to keep you from feeling bad .

Mark all the advertisements " Prive.ste and Confidential , " otherwise the people will not read them . M. T. The lecture was given in Carnegie Hall , which had been gaily decorated for the occasion . The house was more than filled , and a great sum of money was realized for the fund .

" A short time after his return to America he received a pretty , childish letter from little Miss Agnew acknowledging a photograph he had sent her , and giving a list of her pets and occupations . Such a letter always delighted Mark Twain , and his pleasure in this one is reflected in his reply . To Miss Joy Agnew , in London : TUXEDO PARK , NEW Yu ..

These ? with the kiss of fealty from your other subject MARK TWAIN . In his philosophy What Is Man , and now and again in his other writings , we find Mark Twain giving small credit to the human mind as an originator of ideas . The most original writer of his time , he took no credit for pure invention and allowed none to others . The mind , he declared , adapted , consciously or unconsciously ; it did not create . In a letter which follows he elucidates this doctrine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the kerosene , have to do with Captain " Hurricane " Jones and his theory of the miracles of " Isaac and of the prophets of Baal " as expounded in " Some Rambling Notes of an Idle Excursion .

Christ , in New York : RzonnsG , Caxm. , Aug. , ' oR . DEAR SIR , ? You say " I often owe my best sermons to a suggestion received in reading or from other exterior sources . " Your remark is not quite in accordance with the facts . We must change it to ? " I owe all my thoughts , sermons and ideas to suggestions received from sources outside of myself , The simplified English of this proposition is ? " No man 's brains ever onginated an idea . " It is an astonishing thing that after all these ages the world goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It ca n't . It never has done it . In all cases , little and big , the thought is born of a suggestion ; and in all cases the suggestions come to the brain from the outside . The brain never acts except from exterior impulse . A man can satisfy himself of the truth of this by a single process ? Ier him examine every idea that occurs to him in an hour ; a day ; in a week ? in a life-time if he please . He will always find that an outside something suggested the thought , something which he saw with his eyes or heard with his ears or perceived by his touch ? not necessarily today , nor yesterday , not last year , nor twenty years ago , but sometime or other . Usually the source of the suggestion is immediately traceable , but sometimes it is n't .

The idea of writing to me would have had to wait a long time if it waited until your brain originated it- It was born of an outside suggestion ? Sir Thomas and my old Captain . The hypnotist thinks he has invented a new thing ? suggestion , This is very sad . I do n't know where my captain got his kerosene idea ( It was forty-one years ago , and he is long ago dead . ) But I know that it did n't originate in his head , but it was born from a suggestion from the outside . Yesterday a guest said , " How did you come to think of writing The Prince and the Pauper ? " I did n't . The thought came to me from the outside ? suggested by that pleasant and picturesque little history-book , Charlotte M. Yonge 's Little Duke . I doubt if Mrs. Burnett knows whence came to her the suggestion to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to her from reading The Prince and the Pauper . In all my life I have never originated an idea , and neither has anybody else .

It seems a great pity that they allowed her to die a natural death .

However , the Harpers are sending Leigh up to play billiards ; therefore I shall survive . Affectionately , S. L. CtEmENs . Early in June that year Clemens had developed unmistakable symptoms of heart trouble of a very serious nature . It was angina pectoris , and , while to all appearance he was as well as ever and usually felt so , he was visited by sudden attacks of acute " breast pains " which , as the months passed , increased in frequency and severity . He was alarmed and distressed ? not on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a handsome girl , who had long been sub-ject to epileptic seizures . In case of his death he feared that Jean would be without permanent anchorage , his other daughter , Clara ? following her marriage to Ossip Gabrilowitsch in October ? having taken up residence abroad . This anxiety was soon ended . On the morning of December 24th , Jean Clemens was found dead in her apartment . She was not drowned in her bath as was reported , but died from heart exhaustion , the result of her malady and the shock of cold water . Mark Twain had returned from a month 's trip to Bermuda a few days before Jean died . Now , by his physician 's advice , he went back to those balmy islands . He had always loved them , since his first trip there with Twichell thirty-three years earlier , and at " Bay House , " the residence of ViceConsul Allen , where he was always a welcome guest , he could have the attentions and care and comforts of a home . Taking Claude , the butler , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presently sent back a letter in which he said , " Again I am leading the ideal life , and am immeasurably content . " Through February , and most of March , letters and reports from him were about the same . He had begun to plan for his return , and concerning amusements at Stormfield for the entertainment of the neighbors , and for the benefit of the library which he had founded soon after his arrival in Redding . In these letters he seldom mentioned the angina pains that had tortured him earlier . But once , when he sent a small photograph of himself , it seemed to us that his face had become thin , and that he had suffered . Certainly his next letter was not reassuring . To A. B. Paine , in Redding : DEAR PAINS , ? We must look into the magic-lantern business . Maybe the modern lantern is too elaborate and troublesome for back-settlement use , but we can inquire .

I may have to go sooner if the pain in my breast does n't mend its ways pretty considerably . I do n't want to die here , for this is an unkind place for a person in that condition . I should have to lie in the undertaker 's cellar until the ship would remove me and it is dark down there and unpleasant . The Colliers will meet me on the pier and I may stay with them a week or two before going home . It all depends on the breast pain ? I do n't want to die there . I am growing more and more particular about the place . With love , S. L. C. This letter had been written by the hand of his " secretary , " Helen Allen . Evidently writing had become an effort to him . Yet we did not suspect how rapidly the end was approaching , and only grew vaguely alarmed . A week later , however , it became evident that his condition was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having a most uncomfortable time for the past 4 days with that breast-pain , which turns out to be an affection of the heart , just as I originally suspected . The news from New York is to the effect that nonbronchial weather has arrived there at last , therefore if I can get my breast trouble in travelling condition I may sail for home a week or two earlier than has heretofore been proposed . Yours as ever , S. L. CLEMENS , ( per H. S. A. ) In this letter he seems to have forgotten that his trouble had been pronounced an affection of the heart long before he left America , though at first it had been thought that it might be gastritis . The same mail brought a letter from Mr. Allen explaining fully the seriousness of his condition . I sailed immediately for Bermuda , arriving there on the 4th of April . He was not suffering at the moment , though the pains came now with alarming frequency and violence . He was cheerful and brave . He did not complain . He gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A parr of the Stormfield estate had been a farm which he had given to Jean Clemens , where she had busied herself raising some live stock and poultry . After her death he had wished the place to be sold and the returns devoted to some memorial purpose . The sale had beenmade during the winter and the price received had been paid in cash . I found him full of interest in all affairs , and anxious to discuss the memorial plan . A day or two later he dictated the following letter the last he would ever send . It seems fitting that this final word from one who had so long given happiness to the whole world should record a special gift to his neighbors . To Charles T. Lark , in New York : HAMILTON , BERMUDA . April -6 , ' sue . DEAR MR . LARK , ? I have told Paine that I want the money derived from the sale of the farm , which I had given , but not conveyed , to my daughter Jean , to be used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the building to be called the Jean L.

Hazen , all of Redding , these trustees to form a building Committee to decide on the size and plan of the building needed and to arrange for and supervise the work in such a manner that the fund shall amply provide for the building complete , with necessary furnishings , leaving , if possible , a balance remaining , sufficient for such repairs and additional furnishings as may be required for two years from the time of completion . Will you please draw a document covering these requirements and have it ready by the time I reach New York ( April 14th ) . Very sincerely , S. L. CLEMENS . He sailed on the r zrh of April , reaching New York on the 14th as he had planned . A day or two later Mr. and Mrs. Gabrilowitsch , summoned from Italy by cable , arrived . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind was comparatively clear up to the last day . On the afternoon of April 21st he sank into a state of coma , and just at sunset he died . Three days later , at Elmira , New York , he was laid beside Mrs. Clemens and those others who had preceded him .
