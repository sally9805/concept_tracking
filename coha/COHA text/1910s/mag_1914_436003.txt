IT was in October , 1886 , that I was admitted to the American boarding-school , known to us as the High School of Sfik-el-Gharb , a village situated on one of a lofty chain of hills overlooking the Mediterranean Sea , about nine miles east of the city of Beyrout . In making preparations for this important step , the first thing on the programme was an order to the carpenter for a clothes-chest . This was a proud possession , the first earthly object besides my clothes which I could call my own . The carpenter covered the chest with cheap yellow paint which , whenever , however , and wherever I touched it , came off on my hands and clothes . It must have been a very interesting spectacle to see a ' green ' boy painted yellow . As for myself , instead of the bloomer-like shirwal , used among the Lebanonians , I put on the more genteel ghimbaz ( a gown which resembles a kimono ) , an embroidered vest , a silk sash , white stockings and red slippers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who cheered my way with quaint songs , carried me , with my bed and clothes-chest , to the coveted institution of learning . Upon my arrival I was assigned three pine boards and two saw-horses as a bedstead . That was the first elevating influence of education that I felt . But by force of habit as well as gravitation I found myself twice on the floor in my first night in that American school . When the supper-bell rang that evening , the pupils filed into the dining-40room , where seats were assigned to the newcomers . All remained standing until the senior teacher came in and said grace . That pious act was startling to me . I had seen my teacher , a layman , offer prayer at the opening of every school-day in my childhood , and I greatly enjoyed the little service , but that a layman should bless the food ' was altogether at variance with my religious antecedents . Only the priest had the authority to lift his consecrated hand and bestow a blessing on such an occasion . Where did the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? With such a question in mind , I could not be reverent during the prayer . I did not bow my head or close my eyes ; I looked at the praying teacher with much curiosity as I explained to myself that the entire performance was a peculiarity of Protestantism with which I was not at all concerned . I had come to the school to get knowledge , and nothing else . Next morning lessons began . Owing to the fact that my schooling had been so sadly interrupted when I was put to work at the age of nine , I was assigned to a class of beginners . ' They were much younger boys than L and among them I appeared like a giant among pigmies . I was tall , rough , and awkward , with a vague hunger for knowledge . Under the circumstances , it was a great consolation that my dear friend , Iskander , who had just been elevated to the position of instructor , was to be my teacher . All studies , up to the senior year , were given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It interested me at once . I looked upon the English Primer as the gateway to untold mysteries , and when I was able to say , Tun , mouse , run . The cat will catch ou , ' I felt that I had entered into the exalted circle of the learned . But the study which assumed supremacy in my mind above all others during my first year in school was that of the Bible . I shall never forget the thrilling charm of my first Sunday-School lesson . Our topic was the story of Elijah 's ascension into heaven in a chariot of fire . As a Syrian boy I had not the slightest difficulty in believing in miracles . In the minds of my people the miraculous element stands as the very foundation of religion . Our Bible was full of miracles . Our saints , even our priests , worked miracles . Miracles grew under our eyes . But , to me , the wonder of wonders was the fact that the Bible , the great and holy book of our religion , the Bible of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much but which I had seen so seldom in the hands of the laity , was now free and open , even to me , not only to read , but to study , and to have explained to me , verse by verse , by ' learned men ' ! Every school-day , for all the scholars , the first lesson was the Bible . It was the Bible , however , not under the microscope of the ' higher critics , ' but the Bible just as it reads . The pupils read the lesson in turn , each reading one or two verses , and the teacher explained the text , as a profound arid uncorrupted supernaturalist must explain it . The ethical distinctions , also , which beset the more highly cultivated minds in these days with regard to certain portions of the Bible , were unknown even to our teachers . We read the scriptural stories just as they were . They had grown and been recorded in our country . They were the very precipitate of the moral and intellectual atmosphere of our people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our heritage , and all bound together by a divine purpose . Therefore , ' What God hath joined together , let not man put asunder . ' The great mystery of the Holy of Holies , as it was interpreted by our teacher , made a profound impression upon me . The Holy of Holies symbolized the unapproachable Divine Presence . ' The holy place , ' where the priests ministered to waiting Israel , represented the world and humanity seeking the light . The ' veil of blue , and purple , and scarlet , and fine twined linen , ' which hung between the Holy of Holies and the holy place , symbolized the barrier which was established between God and mankind when Adam fell , and which could be removed only when the promise of a Saviour was fulfilled . When Jesus was crucified on Calvary , and thus ' paid the price of sin , ' the veil of the temple was rent in twain , from the top to the bottom , ' - signifying the removal of the barrier of original sin and the opening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Father through the Son . To me , that was Christian theology in a nutshell . Other explanations of the Bible were indeed precious , but the lesson of the Holy of Holies , a concentrated world of religious knowledge , was my chief treasure . When I returned home for the Christmas vacation , I was expected to give a creditable account of myself as a student . All my other acquirements seemed to me too insignificant to be compared with my Biblical knowledge , of which , however , my only significant possessions were the interpretation of the Holy of Holies and the story of the ascension of Elijah . So , when a goodly company of friends and relatives came in to greet me , on the evening of my arrival , and asked me to tell what I had learned , ' the story of the Holy of Holies leaped spontaneously forth from my mind . Upon my auditors it had a telling effect . It was amazing to them ' what schools could do . ' One of my cousins was so carried away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throwing up his hands in the air , in Oriental fashion , he exclaimed , ' My cousin , by the life of God , go no deeper into learning . I fear you might lose your mind ! ' The Protestant doctrine of the Bible and the Church was also very interesting to me , but somewhat disquieting . It threatened my ancient orthodox faith in the authority of the Church and the mediatorial offices of the saints . I was taught that the Bible , and the Bible only , was of divine authority ; that church ordinances were man-made , therefore faulty . Prayer to the saints , I was told , was a worship of the creature in place of the Creator ' ; the Church was the company of all believers , and not simply a body of priests ; fasting and other legalistic practices were vain efforts on the part of man to save himself by his own endeavor , instead of seeking salvation by faith in the atoning merits of Christ . I felt especially predisposed to set my face against Protestantism when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ' Mother of God . ' My education was not confined to the Bible and Protestant doctrines . I was instructed in arithmetic , in English , in reading the classical Arabic , in grammar , geography , and writing . My more mature faculties led me soon out of the beginners ' class to higher grades , and in the latter part of the year I was allowed to attend the class of essayists , ' . whose essays were heard and criticised by the senior teacher every Saturday morning . The most startling experience of my first year in school was my preaching ' at the meeting of the recently organized Christian Endeavor Society , which comprised the entire student body and all the teachers . Toward the end of the year , the invitation to exercise this office came to me as a great honor , but it was a crushing one . At the appointed time one of the teachers led the devotional exercises , and then quietly introduced me as the preacher of the evening . It was the first time in my life that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' which occupied four foolscap pages , had taken me so long to write that I thought it would take as long to read . I was disposed , therefore , to read it from the pulpit with rapidity . What the sermon was about I have not the slightest recollection , and the manuscript is lost . What I do remember of that occasion is a curious psychological experience . As I looked down from the platform I seemed to be peering through a powerful magnifying-glass . The heads of my auditors assumed enormous proportions ; their eyes glared at me like those of an angry bull , and really frightened me . Nothing whatever seemed normal . It was my sub-conscious self that read the little sermon , and I ' came to ' in my seat in the audience , mopping my face violently . Unconscious of all that was going on around me , I turned to one of the boys and asked , ' What happened ? ' You preached , ' was his hasty answer , ' for about two minutes . ' When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received by my family and friends , not only affectionately but with that regard which is accorded seekers after knowledge among all peoples . The fact that my attainments were as yet very meagre counted for naught with my people . I was in the path of wisdom , and that was enough . But such honors brought with them great responsibilities . I was supposed to be able to give an enlightened opinion on every subject under the sun , from a problem in subtraction to medical questions and the policies of the European nations . It was a source of gratification to my parents , and to the pious among our neighbors , that I had not departed from my Mother Church . During that slimmer our little parish had the rare privilege of a visit from the great Patriarch of Antioch , who was then on a pastoral tour through his ancient see . Aside from the stupendous prestige of his official position , he was a personal friend of the Sultan , and so , wherever he went , the governors of the provinces were little more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the neighboring villages went out to meet him . The men of our church formed themselves into an armed escort , firing salutes all the way and enveloping the entire procession , Patriarch and all , in clouds of smoke and dust . I was equipped for the occasion with a pair of flint-lock pistols and a more modern double-barreled shotgun , and my place in the procession was close to the white horse of His Eminence . At such times as this 1 felt myself to be as yet a true Greek Orthodox , but when I returned to the ordinary routine of worship in our village church , I discovered that the Protestant virus had gone deeper into my blood than I had been aware of , or desired . My soul was rent in twain . Sentimentally , I was still Greek Orthodox ; intellectually , I had leaned perceptibly toward Protestantism . The pictures of the saints on the walls of our church seemed to me less rich in spiritual mystery than they did before I went to school . Saint-worship and many church ceremonials appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bible , and my inquiring mind chafed under their claims . Such issues were perpetually in my mind , and I was inclined to argue them with my parents or even with the priest . The priest , however , who was very ignorant and quick-tempered , had very little to say excepting to rebuke me for emulating the methods of those accursed Protestants who know nothing else but to argue . ' With all our differences , however , I managed to retain my respect for the priest until he led me , by his own arrogance , to think and act differently . After my return from school , I no longer observed fast-days and days of abstention from meat . One evening , as ill-luck had it , the priest called at our house and found me eating meat on a forbidden day . He was violent with rage . ' What are you eating , you accursed of God ? ' he said . ' You are neither sick nor feeble . Why do you sin in this manner ? ' Shaking with anger , he advanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table from before me . In an instant I was on my feet , deeply insulted and greatly angered . I told him to leave the house instantly , else I should drive him out with a stick . My parents were inexpressibly shocked . While they regretted his indiscretion , they were horrified at my conduct toward ' the priest of my people . ' ' My son , my son , ' exclaimed my mother , after our visitor had gone , ' the priest may be a bad man . Still he possesses the mystery of the priesthood . ' ' The mystery of the priesthood ! ' cried I. ' Cursed be he and his mystery ! A bad man can not make a good priest . Mother , I am a Protestant - upon the housetop. ' 1 My second year at school found me very happy and successful in my studies , but my lessons did not compare in significance with the general , indefinable influence which my school associations exerted over me . I seemed to awaken and absorb revolutionary religious and social forces . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I began to feel intelligently the impact of the past and to have visions of the more significant future . My teachers spoke encouragingly to me of my swift progress ? ' a youth who had but very recently forsaken the barren life of the stonemason and taken up the duties of the student . ' It was during the autumn of this year that I joined the Protestant Church . ( Happily we knew no denominational designations in that school , which , however , was of the Presbyterian persuasion . ) The American missionary , the Reverend Theodore Pond , who was the principal , examined me and received me into church fellowship . This step I took upon my own responsibility . I knew my parents would not favor it , so I did not ask them . Protestantism seemed to me more reasonable than my old form of faith . It did away with many church ordinances which had often bewildered my growing mind , and it afforded me a closer communion with Christ , who was the only Saviour of the world . Above all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and laid much emphasis on religion as life . When I was being examined by Mr. Pond , he asked me what my parents would think of the step I contemplated taking . ' They would oppose it , ' I answered . ' Would you disobey your parents ? ' he asked . ' In this case I would , ' said I. ' The Master has said , " He that loveth father or mother more than me , is notworthy of me . " Therefore Christ stands above earthly parents . ' Mr. Pond was pleasantly ' surprised at the quick but authoritative answer , and expressed the hope that my parents might , in the not far future , see the wisdom of my course . My friend Iskander and I were the only Protestants in Betater , and while we were not persecuted in a mAiEeval sense , we had to fight many battles in defense of our faith . When we came in collision with intelligence , we were no mean fighters , but in the face of benighted bigotry we were often helpless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a little . We were referred to sneeringly as ' the Lutherans , the followers of the lustful monk who ran away from the church in order to get married . ' We were urged to admit the truth of the assertions that the Protestants who refused to confess their sins to the priest went up and confessed to the stone-roller on the housetop . ' Many of our leaders , so they said , held communion with Satan . Our marriage service , being performed by a ' lay-preacher , ' was invalid . Therefore , Protestant children were bastards , and so forth . Of intelligent criticism we seldom heard a word . Therefore , the reviling of our theological enemies only strengthened our hold on our new belief . Our own families accepted our defection from the faith as one would the inevitable , and parental and filial love kept us generally at peace . While I was at school , I heard much about America . I studied its geography , heard of its great liberator , Washington , and almost every Sunday ' is- tened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its people for missionary work among the heathen of the earth . What has seemed very curious to me in the light of subsequent knowledge is the fact that America was always presented to my mind as a sort of hermit nation . Its people were rich and religious and little else . Every one of its citizens told the truth , and nothing but the truth , went to church every single Sunday , and lived the life of non-resistance . America had neither fleets nor armies and looked to England for the protection of American citizens in foreign lands . I do not remember that the missionaries spoke of America in exactly such terms , but by drawing their illustrations always from the religious side of American life , they led many of us to form such views of the New World . ? But more exciting tales about America came to me through returning Syrian emigrants . Most of them , being common laborers , knew , of course , wry little of the real life of America . They spoke only of its wealth and how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more money in America in a very few years than could be earned in Syria in two generations . More enlightened accounts of the great country beyond the seas came into Stria through a small minority of a better class of emigrants . From such descriptions I had a few glimpses of American civilization , of a land of free schools , free churches , and a multitude of other organizations which worked for human betterment . The fact that a few poor Syrian emigrants who had gone to America had in a few years attained not only wealth but learning and high social positions ? had become real khawajas ? appealed very strongly to my imagination . I would go to America , if some turn of fortune made that possible . At the end of my second year as a student my father told me that he was no longer able to keep me in school . He was getting old fast ; his building enterprises grew smaller every year , and of his twelve children six still remained at home to care for . He had already paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school . Adding to that the loss of my wages for two years , his financial burden was no light one . Disappointment fell upon me with the weight of a calamity . I could not blame my father , so I was the more helpless in dealing with the stubborn difficulty . What was to become of me ? Was I to be forced back to the circumstances against which I had rebelled so successfully two years before ? Were all my hopes to be dashed ? During that summer and autumn my father met with serious business reverses , and we were actually reduced to want . The approach of the winter , always dreaded by the common people of Syria , was doubly dreaded by our family . I had never known what real want was before , and now , after I had been flattered lavishly by my teachers and fellow-students as ' one of the very promising young men , ' to behold our family in the grip of real poverty and to think of myself as the helpless victim of such circumstances , was almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my beloved school in Sfik-el-Gharb and called on Mr. Pond . He asked me interestedly about my plans and listened with sympathy to my story . I told him that my chief desire was to return to the school as a student , but that my father 's circumstances rendered this impossible . It was beyond Mr. Pond 's power to extend me financial assistance , but he offered me the position of a teacher in the primary or day school , which joined the High School , suggesting that in that position deleted material pose because of our familiarity with one another ) snickered at my distressing experience . My three years of activity and intellectual endeavor as a school-teacher , while they proved advantageous in many ways , failed to put me on the highway of true progress . My salary kept me on the level of poverty , and the opportunities for promotion were extremely scant . I began to realize that soul-expansion and a useful career in the world of knowledge depended first and last , not on the theories of the schoolroom , but on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claim no nationality and no flag . The rule of the Turk was painfully repressive . Under it love of freedom and of progress was a crime against the State . Our schools were simply foreign colonies , tolerated by the Sultan because of the great powers which stood behind them . The enlightened youth of the country not only lacked the opportunities which call forth and develop the nobler human qualities , but were constantly watched by the government as possible revolutionists . With a multitude of other young men I longed and prayed inwardly and silent ly for better things , or , at least , for the opportunity to emigrate from a country in which life slowly but surely grew to mean intellectual and moral death . Whither should I go ? On one occasion Mr. Pond suggested to me to enter the ministry in my own country . He thought I was qualified by nature for the sacred office , and lacked only the training , which I could have , free , in the theological department of the rian Protestant College in Beyrout . The offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had listened to in school , including Mr. Pond himself , made no strong impression on me . Their messages were almost wholly formal statements of doctrine , whose dynamic power decreased in proportion as they were repeated from Sunday to Sunday . My answer to Mr. Pond 's proposition was that I had never contemplated entering the ministry , nor did I feel at the time inclined to entertain such an idea . We both ' hoped ' that in the future I might be led to take such a step . My hope , however , was a mere imitation of his , for the matter dropped from my mind soon after I left his house . At last I concluded to continue teaching school , preferring , however , to return to Zahlah , where I had worked during my second year as teacher . Early in September , 1891 , I went thither to visit some friends and more particularly to apply for my former position as a teacher . Upon my arrival I was told that two young men , who had been close friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning . The news startled me . Certainly I must go and bid them good-bye . Soon after supper I called at the home of one of them and found them both there . We fell on one an-other 's neck and kissed in Oriental fashion . Speaking both at once , they said , ' Abraham , why do n't you go with us ? What is there in Syria for a man like you ? Come , let us go to America together . ' The words of my friends , while they stirred violently the depths of my soul and awakened a thousand slumbering hopes , rendered me speechless . ' Why do n't you say yes ? ' they asked . ' Let nothing stand in your way , and let us make the voyage together . ' ' How can I go , ' I said , ' with so many obstacles in the way ? ' ' What obstacles ? ' queried my friends . ' If your chief difficulty is financial , we stand ready to lend you all the money you need until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask for ? ' The moment seemed to me of divine significance . Really , what better chance could I ask or hope for ? At last America was within my reach . Would it be anything short of madness to let such a great privilege go by ? I had to act on my own responsibility , but I remembered that when I dropped my tools as a stonemason and went to school , I had to act on my own responsibility ; when I left the church of my fathers and became a Protestant , I had to follow my own course . Now I was called upon to make a third great decision , and to make it quickly . The wiser powers within and above me again asserted themselves , and I decided that I would go to America . Our final plan was that I was to return home at once , secure all the money I could , and , within two days , join my friends at Beyrout , whence we were to sail for the New World . My sudden decision to emigrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but not altogether unpleasant . They had confidence in me because I was ' a learned man . ' They regretted deeply my having to depend on others for funds , but it all seemed to them Allah 's will . Pushing her scarf back from her forehead and lifting her eyes and hands to heaven , my mother implored the all-seeing , all-wise Father , whose will it was that her favorite son should be torn away from her arms , possibly forever , to guide and prosper him , and return him safe to his father 's house . All the money which my father could give me amounted to three napoleons . He wept because he could find no more . It required no very long time to complete my preparations for the voyage . My clothes were tied up into a bundle in a large bandanna . My bed for the ship ' was much like that of the man who was sick of the palsy , consisting of a cushion , a pillow , and a light quilt . With such t , n equipment I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most important task was to secure the indorsement of our teskaras , ? passports , ? which we had obtained from the government of Mt . Lebanon , by the Beyrout officials . Difficulties were often placed in the way of emigrants from Turkey by the officials for the purpose of extorting money from them . Emigration to America was discouraged and generally supposed to be prohibited . Our passports indicated that our destination was Alexandria , which was true , but not the whole truth . Moreover , our more refined speech and manners seemed to remove us , in the minds of the officials , from the ordinary class of emigrants . For the indorsing of our passports we were required to pay half a madjidy ? Turkish dollar ? each , and we thought our exit from the unbeloved empire was rather cheap . Our opinion was probably suspected , for shortly after we left the wharf , our boat was halted and an officer demanded our teskaras . The inspector appeared stern and doubtful . Our own boatman advised us to ' present ' the inspector with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We heeded the advice and the boat went on . When we were within a few yards of our steamer another haughty inspector interrupted our progress and demanded our teskaras . Another ' half a madjidy each ' gave us our freedom . We left our ' mother country ' with nothing but curses for her government on our lips . Our steamer tickets entitled us to passage from Beyrout to Marseilles as deck passengers ' ? the equivalent of the steerage on Atlantic liners . With more gayety than wisdom we estab- fished our quarters high up on the foredeck . There were more sheltered places , but we scorned them . Joppa was our first stopping-place . Next came Port Said , where a large contingent of Russian Jews joined us . This little city seemed to me a wonder . A department store , a mere toy compared with the department stores of America , dazzled me . Its large glass windows and a real sidewalk around it quickened my poetic sense . I seemed to myself to have come face to face with some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in describing the scenes before me . Alexandria came next , and Port Said was dwarfed in my imagination . I tore up the description of the department store and proceeded to poetize the great city of Alexander . Shortly after we left this port for Marseilles , the Mediterranean began to be unfriendly . Our quarters on the foredeck , our trunks and bedding , caught the copious spray from every wale . Our gayety changed to grave concern , and all our singing ceased . A peculiar ailment also seized me just below the diaphragm . With our portable beds in our arms we sought more sheltered places , but found them all filled with an inhospitable crowd of Jews and Gentiles . In our extremity , we resorted to a malodorous recess on the port side of the lower deck where many trunks and bundles of clothing had been thrown for shelter , and where ducks and other feathery fellow creatures were kept within wire screens . The ducks gave screams of terror because of our intrusion , and we did no less , because of their presence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and we all lay piled on top of that heap of freight , across one another 's bodies , much like the neglected wounded in a great battle . An incident which occurred in that hole ( which I have called ever since the duck apartment ' ) still lives in my memory , because of its amusing and ethical aspects alike . Lying across my legs , and barely within shelter , was a very kindhearted , God-fearing man from Damascus . I was just telling him not to allow another person to come in with us , because we were almost suffocated as it was , when we heard a woman approaching us , uttering in the Egyptian dialect terrible imprecations against the steamship company . I felt that a veritable terro- was about to visit us , and very ungallantly called to him , ' By the life of Heaven , do n't allow this woman in here ! ' In a second she was upon us , and demanded accommodation . Lewajeh Allah , ' ? for the face of God , ' ? said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one side . In an instant the wrathful Egyptian wedged herself in , squirmed round until she secured the proper leverage , and then kicking mightily with both feet , pushed the beneficent Damascene clear out on the wave-washed deck ! When we landed at Marseilles I could hardly credit my senses . Everything Turkish had disappeared and I was walking the streets of France , the great country of which I had heard so much . My friends having studied at the Syrian Protestant College , besides having a fair knowledge of the English language , knew some French , by the aid of which we escaped on many occasions from the hands of interpreters and ticket-brokers of our own nationality . In Marseilles I first saw electric lights , which fascinated me beyond description , and there I first marveled By this expression the Orientals mean , for no earthly reward . The good deed is cast God-ward , and finds compensation with Him . ? Tae AUTHOR . at a railway train . I narrowly escaped being run over near the railway station , when I dashed across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train . A uniformed man , who , I infer , was a guard , shouted at me so fiercely that I thought he was beside himself . I was not fully acquainted with the fact that a train would really run over a hopeful and ambitious young man . It was in Marseilles also that I first experienced a distinctly Occidental sensation , when I cast off the soft Turkish fez and put a stiff , and , incidentally , ill-fitting , hat on my head . At Marseilles we bought tickets for New York . We were shipped by train ( third-class ) to Paris , whence , after a halt of a few hours during which we wandered in the neighborhood of the railway station , ? ' just to see Paris , ' ? we were reshipped to Havre . Here we were herded in a lodging-house , together with many other steerage passengers , for two nights , and were each of us given a table equipment of tinware , consisting of a plate , two spoons differing in size , a cup , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were marched out to the steamer in the style of well-behaved convicts , carrying our labels in our hats . The steerage of those days on a second-or third-class steamer certainly fell below the worst tenement house . Hundreds of men , women , and children were herded together in a large and filthy cave in the lower regions of the steamer , under conditions which precluded even the commonest decency . The food was distributed to the passengers in buckets and large tin pans , from which they filled their tin plates and cups , and to the swift was the race . Fortunately for us ' college men , ' and thanks to the linguistic qualifications of my two friends , who won the respect of the captain , or an officer who we thought was the captain , we were given quarters with a few others in a room which contained three tiers of three berths each , and which was more or less successfully partitioned from the main steerage quarters . We had our full share of the noise and stench of the general surroundings , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Almost all the way I suffered from that peculiar sickness whose acquaintance I first made between Alexandria and Marseilles . Having seen much better days at home , the diet of the steamer tortured my soul . The lower class of Europeans did by no means appeal most exquisitely to my aesthetic sense . My physical weakness made the uncertainty of my future and my financial difficulties oppressive to me . But hope remained alive , the great New World , the enchanter of my soul , was very near at hand , and the God of my fathers was my God and helper . On the evening of October 6 , 1891 , our steamer cast anchor in the harbor of New York , too late for us to disembark . From some Italian venders who had boarded the ship we bought the needful things for the evening repast . Here I ate the first real meal since we had left Havre . A certain meat composite , strongly spiced , proved unspeakably toothsome to me . Upon inquiry I learned that it was called bologna , ' which term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the New World . Refreshed and sustained by my savory supper , and exhilarated by the thought of my arrival in the great city of New York , I proceeded to the casting of my accounts . The outcome was not all that could be desired . The figures , which ' do not lie , ' showed that my assets were about nine cents ( half a franc ) and my liabilities forty dollars , which I owed to my friends . Under those somewhat embarrassing cir- cumstances , I was to face the inspector of immigrants at Ellis Island the following morning . But the significance of the exact knowledge of my straightened circumstances went with me far beyond the usual depression one feels under similar conditions . I was told by well-informed fellow-passengers that on the morrow I stood in danger of being deported because the immigration laws of America required an immigrant such as I was , with no family and no position awaiting him in this country , to give satisfactory evidence that he had no less than twenty dollars ( the sum must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could not be admitted into the United States . That was decidedly unwelcome information . It took away all the pleasure of my bologna supper . To be deported to Turkey ! Just think of it ! Had my blossoming hopes come so near fruition only to be blasted ? I would not ask my friends for more money . They had already told me that they could lend me no more without endangering their own future . But the situation being of such a peculiar nature , my companions came to the rescue by offering to lend me four pounds ' on demand , ' with which to meet the requirements of the law . I found no reason to reject the offer . On the following morning , armed with my ' short loan , ' I stood before the inspector , who was a Syrian , with onlyslight tremors in my knees . He asked me my age , the name of the Syrian province whence I came , whether I could read and write , took down my description , and then , with a smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very near giving myself away when , with a smile broader still than his , I answered , ' What should I do with a wife , when I can hardly take care of myself ? ' With a very encouraging laugh , he said , ' Married Syrian immigrants get on much better in this country than the unmarried . ' I do not know now in what connection I quoted two lines of poetry to the genial inspector , and , with more playfulness than wisdom , asked him whether he knew of any beautiful damsel in the Syrian colony who would consider the advances of a willing young poet . With another hearty smile , he said , ' Pass on , you are all right . ' He did not ask about money ! As we passed out of the building , my merry friends said , ' Abraham , your wily poetry served you well this time .
