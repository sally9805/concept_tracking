txt While Congress is as busy as the clown at the circus doing nothing which anybody wants done the Chamber of Commerce directs its attention to an issue which will impose itself upon attention some time or other , however the politicians may seek to shirk it . The country learned as long ago as in President CLEVELAND 'S time what is meant by the working of an endless chain for the extraction of gold from the Treasury . Last week the Chamber of Commerce directed attention to the fact that the same chain is still in working order , and ought to be put out of business . It is hardly to be - doubted that when the question comes before the Chamber for action upon the report of its committee it will approve of Mr. SELIGMAN 'S resolution that , after the Treasury has once redeemed notes with gold , being the proceeds of bonds issued for the procurement of that gold , the notes should be canceled and not reissued , since those conditions would indicate a redundancy of currency which ought not to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principle those are the conditions of the present time , and the manner in which our system is working is worth attention . Only a little time ago we repeatedly called attention to the fact that the volume of our banknotes persisted in- increasing unnaturally . The depressed conditions of trade and the money market called for redticdon of the volume of credits and currency , yet our bond-secured currency persisted in coming out . The banks held 2 per cents om a basis which necessitated making them earn something more than their interest yield , and the notes based on thorn were forced into circulation under the most unwholetiome conditions . The contrary is now true . Last month we exported $32,000,000 of ' gold , and yet the circulation of National banknotes also decreased $7 ; 597,000 . The changes are in no way troublesome , so barbarically strong are we in our gold supply and in our prohibition of its use in any civilized way in our banking system . Our bank exchahges are an April record , and our currency-supply was at its record maximum on May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold is leaving the country . It is an object lesson which ought to be ' conclusive at a time when another bond issue is impending , and the Treasury is asking that the 8 per cents shall have circulation- privileges the same as the twos , the tax being adjusted so that there shall be no discrimination against the bonds bearing the lower rate . It is no time to add to the proved redundancy of our currency by legislation which shall make its volume depend rather on the cost of the Panama Canal than oh the needs of trade . The best way to protect the 2 per cents is to provide that they shall have a monopoly of the circulation privilege . The interval before their maturity provides ample opportunity for amending the system with fair notice to all . The , forthcoming bonds should rest on their merits as investments to all alike , National banks having neither duties nor privileges in connection with them . The sustaining force of the National banks ' influence upon National credit is too precious to fritter away in times of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as that in which it was first exercised , and the way should be cleared at such a time of convenience as the present
