txt In a discussion of foreign affairs in the House of Commons yesterday the Foreign Secretary , Sir Edward Grey , said that the Angio-Russian agreement was not intended to impair the independence and integrity of Persia . A declaration to that effect had been made to the Persian Government , but Great Britain was not undertaking any obligation to protect the integrity of Persia . The Russian Government , continued the Foreign Secretary , had demanded that Mr. Shuster should be withdrawn . The British Government had said that it did not object to that demand . Mr. Shuster 's intentions in appointing British officials in Northern Persia were good , but the spirit and intention of the Anglo-Russian agreement could not be permitted to be upset and two great nations to be embroiled by the action of any individual , no matter how good his intentions were . The Foreign Secretary said - that if the difficulty were mismanaged or rashly handled by those concerned larger issues of policy might become involved . The British Government strongly opposed the restoration of the ea-Shah , and Russia had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that kind . In this connection Sir Edward read ft communication from the St. Petersburg Government stating that the Russian troops would not advance from Kasbin for eight days unless extraordinary circumstances should force an advance , and that when Persia complied with the Russian demands the further presence of the troops would be ' superfluous . The communication concluded with an assurance of adherence to the Russo-British agreement . Sir Edward insisted upon the importance of the replacing of Treasurer General Shuster without delay by a foreign financial adviser acceptable to Great Britain and Russia . Ho said that these powers should co-operate to assist Persia in obtaining loans and restoring order . After what had happened , added Sir Edward , he agreed with Russia 's demand that the consent of the British and-Rus -- . sian Legations should be obtained : - for , , the appointment of foram advise0e721i1 Persia In conclusion Sir Edward said , thatkaC Persia was unable to pay an Indemnity , he hoped Russia would be induced not to press that demand . Philip Edward Morrell ( Liberal ) said that a poorer excuse for taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case of Mr. , Shuster had never been put forward in the House of . Commons . The exact crime committed by Mr. Shuster , said Dlr. ** was that ' he did not call at the Russian Legation as often as he ought . The Teheran correspondent of The Times says : " A grave situation has arisen at Shiraz , capital of the Province of Fars . The Chief Mollah , Mirza Ibrahim , has stirred popular fanaticism against the British . He has declared that the imperial banknotes are unclean , and as a result they are being presented at the bank by the wholesale for payment , while the shopkeepers refuse to sell even the smallest article to the Indian troops . " The leaders of the religious bodies are urgent in ' their resistance to Russia . and they are preaching a holy war . " TheiCablnet refuses to resign , and it is difficult to see how Russia can obtain other than a Pyrrhic victory against the frenzied population in its present state of mind .
