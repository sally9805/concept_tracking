This biography is successful at least in putting the reader in a position to understand why its subject came to be regarded as the Duke in England , as no man had been- since Wellington 's day . His was a strongly marked personality . Perhaps his root quality was that " dogged veracity " which Dr. Johnson noted in one of his Cavendish ancestors . His intellect was more plodding than brilliant , but in his slow though sure-footed way he sought truth and duty and when he had , as he believed , found them , he clung to them with a determination that nothing could shake . Never passionately admired , incapable of awakening intense antagonisms , lie was yet a political leader worthy to be named alongside Palmerston for so perfectly embodying " the normal English temperament . " People of all classes looked to him , in his later years , at times of crisis , confident that his sturdy common sense would show them the right thing to do . In 1903 , when he was hesitating about resigning from the Cabinet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade , Winston Churchill wrote the Duke that " two workingmen at different clubs informed me that they would wait to see what you decided " ; and Lord Goschen at about the same time told him how some of the greatest . in the land were hanging upon " your decision . " It was the possession by the Duke of this sort of steadfastness and moral weight which led to his being spoken of by Mr. Balfour as " one of the assets of public life in this country , " and by Lord Rosebery as " one of the great reserve forces " of the nation . That Spencer Compton , Lord Hartington , Duke of Devonshire , was entitled to such high regard , the material which Mr. Holland has brought together in these volumes enables us to see . He was born ( in 1833 ) a creature of hearty out-of-door tastes , whom it might seem like torturing nature to turn into a public official slaving at departmental work , or a political leader forced against the grain to do a great deal of public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countless devastators of his day . His early education gave little promise of literary or oratorical distinction ; and in this respect the child was true father of the man . At seventeen we find him with a " mortal hate " of English composition . At Cambridge , he " belonged to the Union Society , by his father 's desire , but never spoke in the debates . " To the end he loathed making speeches , and . groaned at the length and dulness of his own . Said Rosebery : " I do not know any man who spoke with.so much previous anguish or so much misery at the time . " His course at the university was undistinguished . He was not a reading man , nor ever became one . In all his speeches , he is known but once to have quoted a line of poetry . Unlike his father , who was a recluse and devoured books on science and history , he seldom  --  except on official compulsion  --  read anything but newspapers and novels , and for recreation preferred cards to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new book that comes out , Hartington not one .

To a gushing American lady who exclaimed to him abOut his wonderful literary treasures , he merely said : " Yes , it 's a rummy old place . " But this may have been only his air of " passionless indifference . " In 1862 , as Lord Hartington , he made a short visit to the United States and to Canada . He met Seward and Lincoln in Washington . Of the President , he wrote to his father : " I never saw such a specimen of a Yankee in my life . I should think he was a very well-meaning sort of a man , but , almost every one says , about as fit for his position now as a fire-shovel . " He reported that Lincoln was " very civil and also told us stories " Apparently there was no reference to Hartington 's having worn a secession badge at a party in New York  --  pinned to his coat by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biographer We know what Lowell made of the incident : " One of Mr. Lincoln 's neatest strokes of humor was his treatment ' of this gentleman . Mr. Lincoln persisted in calling him Mr. Harting-ton . Surely the refinement of good breeding could go no further . Giving the young man his real name would have made his . visit almost an insult . Had Henri IV done this it would have been famous . " Lord Hartington got to Richmond , having with a party adventurously ridden through the lines without passes . He talked with Davis and his Ministers and " liked them all very well . " They " talked in a very moderate and sensible way . " Lord Hartington , in fact , was at that time , as he himself wrote , " decidedly very Southern in the main . " He even wondered how Englishmen could be " so idiotic as to admire Lincoln , " and could not under stand " how they can talk such nonsense as they do about emancipation . " His own sight of slavery near at hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " the negroes , " on the plantations he visited , " hardly look as well off as I expected to see them , but they are not dirtier or more uncomfortable-looking than Irish laborers . " The latter remark came from one who was to be a great Irish landlord and an opponent of Home Rule . Hartington 's going into Parliament and later taking office under Gladstone signified neither ambition nor liking , but rather a sense of public duty . In his family had long been - established , as in many another great Whig house , the tradition that large property and high social position constituted an obligation to serve the state . When the Irish Secretaryship was offered him , he at first declined it , and accepted it under pressure from Gladstone most reluctantly . Similarly , the War Office had no attractions for him , though he buckled down to ' its routine work like a martyr . Little by little , however , his labors in the Administration and in Parliament began to win him respect for his judgment and confidence in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retired in 1874 as Liberal leader , Hartington became the general choice of the party for-the succession . But the leadership had fairly to be forced upon him . He doubted his own fitness for the position , and he was positive of his dislike for it . Yet again the feudal doctrine of service compelled this modern than to yield . " How I shall get on , Heaven only knows , " he wrote to his father . What Hartington actually did was to drive the Liberals with a rather loose rein during the first years of their exclusion from power , and then when 1880 rolled round and brought victory , to ' give way to Gladstone . The Queen sent for Hartington , and many in the party thought that he should try to form a Government , but it was clear to him that the real leader was Gladstone , and he said so to Victoria . Nor does he appear to have cherished the slightest ill-will because of his having been over-slaughed after having borne the heat and burden of the day . He is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to become Prime Minister of England . But probably he would have said that on no one of the occasions when it was offered him could he discover a sound reason for believing that he could successfully carry on the Government for any length of time . And as there was no overwhelming appeal of duty , he put the matter by without a regret The honors of - public life meant nothing to him ; its duties everything . All of the correspondence which is published respecting his surrender of the leadership to Gladstone in 1880 is in finitely to his credit . Through the whole of it we see his large and simple nature , his transparent honesty , and that sort of mental structure which , as it was said of the head of a certain diplomat , " can take in very little of what is not perfectly clear . " As a member of the Cabinet , Lord Harting-ton had sometimes to defend in.Parliament measures of which he did not wholly approve , though they were no resigning matter , and on- such occasions it was remarked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to allow his opponents to see that he was not heartily for the policy which it was his official duty to advocate . When in 1903 he had a painful doubt that he might have dealt unfairly with Lord George Hamilton , that former colleague wrote to him , " dismiss me from your mind ; you have treated me , as you do everybody else , with absolute good faith . " It was this high repute for stanchness and honor , as well as for sagacity and safety , which made Hartington 's course in reference to Home Rule in 1886 , and it regard to the fiscal question in 1903 , of so much consequence Men ? looked to him for a steadying policy and for scrupulous conduct . Those two political crises are too near us yet to be treated historically , and we need only remark that the letters referring to them in these volumes give little new ' light , though they do bring out the massive patience of this political guide in finding which way for himself the path of duty lay . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ James of Hereford , in reference to his final leaving of the Cabinet ? " I have made a mess of this business and have come out with severe damage " But the only " mess " was that of an honest , but somewhat floundering man , at first misinformed , but finally seeing the light ' and pressing toward it at all hazards . There are printed some letters which passed between the Duke and Mr. Joseph Chamberlain It is instructive to compare the dart and thrust of the latter with the other 's slow but ponderous movement The Duke told the students at Cambridge : " All through life , I have had to work with men who thought three times as quick as I did , and I have found this a great disadvantage . " This kind of sluggish but weighty intellect helps one to understand why Lord Hartington complained that he " could not get on with Gladstone in conversation , " and how he was mystified by Mn Balfour 's economic legerdemain . Indeed , the Duke observed late in life that it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he made it evident that he did not find their type coZ mind congenial . One could as easily imagine Dr Johnson getting on well with David Hume . Mr. Holland 's editing is , on the whole , praiseworthy , though not ideal . Several misprints have escaped him , he has let in too many letters which only lumber the page , while his comments on world affairs and home politics are needlessly long and too often inept . But he has achieved the main object of giving us a full picture of an extraordinary caracare uni . The volumes should not be read for anecdotes though several good stories and sayings are recorded The Duke once said ? " I do n't know why it is , but whenever a man is caught cheating at cards , the case is referred to me : ' This was a recognition of the frequency with which he was called upon to arbitrate in social , as well as political affairs He was fonder of shooting and fishing than of balls or dinners , and would probably have found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prime Minister . He did not , however , have to give up racing for politics , as Bentinck did , or hear the awful news that a horse he had sold had won tha Derby . That shock came to Bentinck , and brought from him , as Disraeli wrote , " a superb grOan . " The Duke of Devonshire was reasonably fond of society , though he seems to have been a little overpowered by the social gayeties into which he was plunged by his Duchess , whom he married late in life . He once said at a great house-party at Chatsworth : " This is all very well , but I should like to know who my guests are . Do you know the name of that red . faced man over there ? " To literature the Duke made no pretensions , and in the theological controversies which raged during his life , he took no interest . It seems almost incredible , but on an occasion when ecclesiastical disputes were invading politics , he said to a private secretary : " Can you explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking about ? " He was once sent to break the news gently to the Vice-President of the Council that the Cabinet had decided to drop his pet educational bill . The Duke went to Sir John 's room , and after standing some time with his back to the fire , said , " Well , Gorst , your d  --  d bill 's dead . " Surely , a great character , if not a great man , he was full of what was individual , but also full of what is typical : a bluff , impassive , downright English nobleman of whom it seems perfectly natural to read that he murmured as he lay dying : " Well , the game is over and I am not Sorry . " CURRENT FICTION . The Healer . By Robert Herrick . New York : The Macmillan Co . Mr. Herrick has two " problems " to deal with here , one of them a fresh one , so far as he is concerned . This is the problem of the modern physician  --  what sort of skill he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Herrick does not take a rosy view of the present estate of the medical profession . In deed , if we are right in fancying that we hear him speaking through the lips of his own authentic healer , he leaves it but one precarious leg to stand on . Almost all professed healers of the day , from the lowest dispenser of patent remedies to the loftiest fashionable specialist , are at least part quack and hypocrite . Virtually all make a trade of what should be a mission . The young Doctor Holden of the story is born and bred in Northern Canada . The instinct of the healer is born in him , and fortune gives him the chance of an education in America and Germany . He shows the greatest promise , but suddenly throws up the game so it must look to his colleagues  --  and returns to his wilderness , to a casual clientele of half-breeds and lumber-jacks . His local fame spreads , he is known as " The Healer " ; but there is something mysterious in the man and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " given up a distinguished career , because he had become convinced that such a career must be based on rotten foundations . " Did n't I see enough of that when I was in the medical school , and in the hospital ' , The big men using their reputation to bleed their patients who were rich enough to pay , and turning the poor over to boys , . And that 's what Elport wants me to do here  --  run what he calls a ' hydropathic establishment ' ? gull the public with spring water , wheedle the rich out of their money , and coddle a lot of old men and women echo ought to die anyway  --  or get out and work for a living , " So cries Holden to his bride . Elport is her uncle , and president of a railway which he is pushing into the wilder . ness . Helen Goodnow is a conventional child of the city , who , straying out into the open , has been captured by the " Wild One . " Here appears Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " Together . " How shall fare the two who are unequally yoked together ? It is impossible for Helen to comprehend her Wild One : she can only subdue him . The result is presently a hydropathic establishment and an income of fifty thousand a year ; a Helen restored to her world , and a Holden relapsed into slavery to the drug he has conquered for her sake . His final salvation is due to another woman . The episode involved is sure to provoke talk , if not discussion , like a certain memorable episode in " Together , " which it . rather too closely par-allels . Mr. Herrick 's solution of the physicianls problem lies in organization and control  --  an " institutional " system involving the elimination of personal fees , and therefore of ' personal motive for insincerity . As for the marriage problem , he can not be said to offer anything beyond a cheerless compromise . We are beyond the squaw era , he admits with a sigh , and must " accord more and ever more rights to these bearers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at present for their liberty and self-direction . Tradition has taught them for generations to work by fraud and wile , and their instinct warns them against the ideal . All prolonged contest with them will end in the deterioration of the man . He must either cut the knot or submit as gracefully as he can to their notion of civilization . " The Wild One understands this , and after experimenting with submission , cuts the knot . It is comforting to reflect that even if this Helen of Mr. Herrick 's is conceded to be Woman , she is not the woman most of us are enslaved to . The Song of Renny . By Maurice Hewlett . New York : Charles Scribner 's Sons . After the Senhouse interlude , Mr. Hewlett appears to have returned with gusto to his old theme and manner . No doubt he felt his mediievalism cramped in its modern dress . The famous " Seuhusian " sweater was after all an inadequate substitute for doublet and coat of mail . And Mr. Hewlett is happiest when he speaks the tongue of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tongue of anybody now dead , for that matter . Examine any one of his pages , and you find his style a medley of current and obsolete idioms . But it is not a hopeless medley  --  the general effect of quaintness for which he strives is gained without sacrificing the ease of the modern reader . In short , the chief distinction of this writer 's somewhat over-lauded style is that it does very cleverly what most historical romances do more or less clumsily . The scene is the southern land of the troubadours , and the hero is one of those decorative persons . The Song of Renny is his masterpiece  --  an elaborate celebration of the fortunes of a great and ill-fated house . " Rascally " would be a fairer epithet , since for generations the Rennys have ravaged and murdered not only their neighbors , but one another . At the moment when the tale properly begins , the last male Renny has been slain by the Count of Pikpoyntz , a robber baron ; and one surviving daughter , a child of twelve , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be gently reared in his own household , meaning to marry her and her great lands when the time comes . But she runs off with a page , and so ends that chapter . Or . rather , it ends a little later , when Pikpoyntz has her murdered , the Renny next in line being also female and marriageable . This lady , whom he abjectly adores , marries him out of ambition ; but she loves the young troubadour , and in the end runs away with him , to be happy ever after . Pikpoyntz is duly hanged , at last , for his sins , and for the novelist 's convenience . To tell the truth , the story is as flimsy and absurd in substance as the usual story of its not uncommon kind . Even the blind villain and the black villain of Treas- Islandism are not lacking . It is only Mr. Hewlett 's picturesque style  --  and perhaps a little his pretty bravado in handling the affair of sex  --  that carries it off . The Following of the Star . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : G. P. Putnam 's Sons . Here is a slough of sentimentality where none but a web-footed reader may safely venture . Skim lightly if you would avoid the tedium of repeated " good things " and escape being smothered in gush . First , gush pertaining to a pulpit-and-pew romance .

Indianapolis , Ind. : The BobbsMerrill Co . Mr. Johnston has hit upon a novel method of blackmail , and in both the development and the detection of the crime has shown no little ingenuity . The climax , particularly , in which most detective stories fail , is well conceived and executed . Only one false note is sounded , but that is a note which goes far toward destroying the emotional efficiency of the whole book . Mr. Johnston has created a villain of the true type , and his baiting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invention . But the interest with which we follow the discovery and thwarting of such criminal machinations as ? are here described depends mainly on theintensity of our feeling of a maleficent and responsible power in the human brain . Mr. Chesterton relied largely on this feeling to create the proper atmosphere about the adventures of his " Father Brown . " Mr. Johnston feels it artistically , but deliberately mars the effect by an irrelevant preachment on the relation of crime to disease , and on the desirability of substituting curative measures for punishment . The result is an ingenious story , which fails to absorb the reader 's mind as it should . Off the Main Road . By Victor L. White-church . New York : The Baker &; Taylor Co . This " village comedy " plays itself in a parish lying comatose somewhere in the interior of England . The old rector , the new rector with his pretty daughter , the young architect who comes to restore the dilapidated church , the solitary mysterious stranger who twenty years before had taken up his abode in Little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reader that the story lies within earshot of present-day civilization ; not enough to spoil the quality of rustic benightedness which is the feature of the tale . Beside these villagers Dogberry was a citizen of the world . The writer has had the skill to shoiv in an amusing light their clownishnesses without giving pictures of brutality . Their very original ways are made entertaining , and their language is thick-studded with gems of utterance . They revolve around a little story of loves , requited or not , that adequately keeps the whole together . METHODS OF LEGAL REFORM . Social Reform and the Constitution . By Frank J. Goodnow . New York : The Macmillan Co. $1.50 net . The problem of Professor Goodnow in this thoughtful book is concerned with the constitutionality , actual or probable , of various social reforms . Such an inquiry of necessity includes political reforms as well ; and while no complete enumeration is attempted , the survey covers most of the projects of social betterment which as yet , in this country , have received any considerable attention . Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Federal Constitution is virtually out of the question , the only guide to a conclusion as to what may be held constitutional in the future is to be found in a study of what has been held constitutional in the past . His method , accordingly , is that of a careful examination of the decisions of the Supreme Court , with a view to discovering what light , if any , they throw on current problems . It is impossible , within the limits of this review , to do more than summarizethe author 's main conclusions , since the evidence which sustains them is necessarily elaborate and detailed . In one or two directions in which judicial exposition and delimitation have been abundant , the problem of constitutional forecast is relatively simple . For example , a study of Federal regulation of navigation as interpreted by the Supreme Court , with reference to its bearing on the important subject of uniform commercial regulation , seems-to show that there is no longer any distinction to be observed between interstate and intrastate navigation ( p , 46 ) ; that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all commerce , whether by water or by land " ( p. 74 ) ; and that Congress may even , " through the exercise of its power to prohibit the interstate or foreign transportation of articles made contrary to the provisions of its legislation , exercise an enormous influence in securing uniform regulation of all the conditions of manufacturing in this country " ( p. 92 ) . This would mean , of course , a vast extension of Federal power at the expense of the powers hitherto regarded as reserved to the States ; but it would also go far toward " making our political system conform to existing economic conditions " ( p. 99 ) . Similarly , a study of decisions regarding Federal control of manufactures points to the conclusion that while the variable intent of the producer , as to the channels through which he will market his product , " is a bar to Federal control and a justification of State control " ( p. 128 ) , there are no judicial precedents adverse to the right of the Federal Government to confer upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for such commerce ; and such commerce , if carried on by corporations , may be restricted to Federal corporations or to those which the Federal Government permits to engage in it , and may , of course , be protected from State interference . Radical as such an exercise of power may seem , Professor Good-now urges that it not only does not imperil private rights , but that it is " absolutely necessary for their protection " ( p. 145 ) . We can not follow Professor Goodnow in detail in his interesting discussion of the constitutional aspects of labor regulations , the use of private property in urban districts , the control - of property " affected with a public interest , " taxation , monopoly , and government aid in the form of pensions or the housing of urban workers . Suffice it to say that while the boundary which separates the Federal and State spheres , ' in such divergent interests , is naturally irregular , the course of judicial decision seems to show in most respects an unmistakable trend toward an enlargement of Federal power , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support by the State courts of social rather than personal considerations . Even in the domain of the private law of the States , every insistence by the Federal courts upon uniformity of interpretation or practice strengthens the movement , " already in full swing " ( p. 193 ) , for the centralization and unification of State law . In an interesting introductory chapter Professor Goodnow points out that the Supreme Court , in its effort to uphold legislation which a progressive society demands , has gone far toward transforming our constitutional law into a system of political science . In other words , the court has become a political body of supreme importance , since " upon its determination depends the ability of the national legislature to exercise powers whose exercise is believed by many to be absolutely necessary to our existence as a democratic republic " ( p. 16 ) . Repeatedly , in his discussion of particular issues , he calls attention to the widening departure from earlier conceptions of State rights and dele. gated powers , and to the resulting contrariety of decision which , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reflect personal opinion or prejudice rather than assured juristic conviction . In a notable final chapter he examines more fully the attitude of the courts toward the new political and social problems that press for solution , defends the propriety of public criticism of judicial decisions , and warns the judiciary that they must take heed to the changes in public opinion if they are themselves to retain their essential powers : Those who assert that by criticism of the Supreme Court we are attacking the foundations of our political system , forget that we are living under a practically unamendable Constitution , and that unless it is Proper to bring popular opinion to bear upon a governmental authority which has the power absolutely to prevent political change , we may easily be tied up so tight in the bonds of constitutional limitation that either development will cease and political death ensue . or those bonds will be broken by a shock that may at the same time threaten the foundations not merely of our political but even of our social system ( p. 358 ) . These are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American law . Doubtless Professor Goodnow will be held by many a special pleader , and his arguments will be used by political partisans to uphold policies both extreme and dangerous . Needless to say , his book has no such purpose and invites no such distortion . While much of what he has to say is , in the nature of the ease , prophecy rather than law , his conclusions are constructive . It is , indeed , not to our credit that in a period of fundamental social change we should be making headway so largely by drifting ; but the drift seems clearly to be in the direction of a constitutional law under which , in spite of the rigidities of a written Constitution , the reforms which enlightened public opinion demands can somehow be accomplished . We commend Professor Goodnow 's volume as the most thoughtful and penetrafing discussion of constitutional tendencies in this country that has appeared in many a day . The Oriental Religions in Roman Paganism . By Franz Cumont . With an Introductory Essay by Grant Showerman . Authorized translation . Chicago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cumont , professor in the University of Ghent for nearly twenty years past , has been known to the few as one of the most capable of living investigators in his chosen field , the ancient religions of the Orient . In 1896 and 1899 , he published an imposing collection of " Textes et monuments figures relatifs aux mysteres de Mithra , " in two volumes , a portion of the first of which , his interpretation of the evidence gathered in the remainder of the work , was presented separately in 1902 , as " Les Mysteres de Mithra . " This was translated and published in this country a year later by the Open Court Publishing Company . In the autumn of 190a , the author delivered the opening series of lectures on the Michonis foundation before the College de France , and a few months later served as Hibbert Lecturer at Oxford . The substance of these two courses appeared in Paris in 1906 , under the title , " Les Religions orientales dans le paganisme remain . " A second edition , 1909 , appeared a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and is now presented to the English reader in the volume bdfore us , timed to coincide with the author 's presence in this country on a lecture tour , which includes the Lowell Institute and a number-of universities and learned societies . These lectures are intended for the general reader , and outline in a lucid and entertaining manner the successive penetration into Roman life and thought of one Oriental faith after another , there to influence and be influenced , until a fairly unified syncresis of Pagan belief took form , " more unlike the worship that Augustus had attempted to restore than the Christianity that fought it . " The traditional Roman religion had not the inherent vigor to resist this inroad . It was too cold and formal , too destitute of any effective relation to man 's higher nature and aspirations . Its loss of any genuine hold on the hearts of men had gone too far to be reversed by the extensive rebuilding of temples and other reform measures undertaken by Augustus . Of course this movement brought back many to the pious practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tostrengthen the chains of the new political order ; and " making religion an auxiliary to moral policing is not a means of establishing its empire over souls , " in Cumont 's opinion . There was a vague longing for something higher , and in spite of the fact that the Eastern faiths were all more or less sullied by vile and atrocious rites , coarse and immodest fables , they did possess something higher . They attached more importance to the inner life and to the value of the individual . They claimed by mysterious rites to cleanse the soul of its impurities , and gave it the assurance that a pious life would be rewarded by a blessed immortality . The acts of self-denial and suffering which they introduced as a means of soul-cleansing took a deeper hold on the imagination than the expiations of the older Roman custom , which consisted merely in the exact performance of certain ceremonies pleasinr to the gods and required by a formal code And the new faiths , too , proved themselves adaptable enough to slough off , during the period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the earlier grossness which constituted their most serious defect . That these Oriental religions were finally superseded by Christianity , Cumont attributes in no small degree to their very likeness to it . " The two opposed creeds moved in the same intellectual and moral sphere , and one could actually pass from one to the other without shock or interruption . " As we turn the pages of the late Latin writers , we may sometimes feel uncertain whether the author is to be classed as pagan or Christian . A few years ago M. Pichon published in Paris a study in which it was shown that the eloquence of the late panegyrists unconsciously changed from , paganism to monotheism in its tone . In the days of Symmachus we do not find in those Roman aristocrats who remained faithful to their inherited religion a mental or moral character radically other than that of the Christians who sat beside them in the Senate . " The religious and mystical spirit of the Orient had slowly overcome the whole social organism and had prepared all nations to unite in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who would pursue further the lines of thought taken up in these lectures , the eighty pages of notes by which they are followed will form an invaluable guide . The lectures themselves stand virtually as they were originally written , six years ago , but the bibliographies and references in the notes have been extended to cover the more recent literature of the subject . We welcome the work in its English dress , and expect from it , together with the author 's presence in our universities as a lecturer , a distinctly stimulating effect on American classical scholarship . Poetry and Prose . By Adolphus Alfred ? Jack . London : Constable &; Co . Mr. Jack is a thoughtful and interesting representative of a distinct tradition in English criticism . His present critical attitudd he attributes mainly to the influence of A. C. Bradley 's Oxford lectures on poetry . He has also constantly in mind the method and purpose of Matthew Arnold . The title of the present book , however , harks back to certain famous distinctions of Coleridge  --  perhaps to the following passage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to discover what the qualities in a poem are , which May be deemed promises and specific symptoms of poetic power , as distinguished from general talent determined to poetic compositiOn by accidental motives , by an act of the will , rather than by the inspiration of a genial and productive nature . " To make clear the essential difference between ' prose and poetry , to distinguish in a particular author , the varying intensity of the " esemplastic " power by constant comparison of passages and an ultimate appeal to the cultivated taste of the reader  --  such are the aim and the procedure of the work . The chapter divisions are these : Poetry : A Note ; Gray ( Social or Prose Poetry ) ; Burns ( Natural or Spontaneous Poetry ) ; Wordsworth ( Basic or Elemental Poetry ) ; Byron ( Oratorical Poetry ) ; Emerson ? The Poet as Teacher ; Arnold ? Critical Poetry ; Meredith ? Intellectual Poetry ; Emerson 's Doctrine of the Infinite . Perhaps the characteristic defect of this school of criticism is a too exclusive attention to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and detail of general literary history . Thus the impeccable Arnold , " taking the roll of our chief poetical names " from Spenser to Keats , includes Campbell and Moore , but omits Donne and Marlowe ; and one is inclined to question rather the extent of his reading than the soundness of his judgment . Mr. Jack 's treatment of Gray is unsympathetic , and the unsatisfactory character of his essay is not a mere matter of taste . His choice of the profound and curious scholar , the slender poet with his little bundle of ardent odes and elegies , the melancholy , shy , life-long recluse  --  his choice of Gray as the best representative of social and prose poetry of , the eighteenth century seems to indicate but a sluggish and superficial acquaintance with the men and movements of the age . Gray is entirely of the eighteenth century , says Mr. Jack ; he sees the world " from the point of view of his century , the sober , intensely English eighteenth century , from the point of view of a writer of prose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the emphasis of its delivery . It would apply fairly well to Pope and admirably to Johnson , but Gray it does not . fit at all . Gray comes to us , indeed , trail-ing shreds of pseudo-classical diction ; born in 1716 , his feet rested on the age of Anne . But Gray developed ; he is one of the most unmistakably " transitional " of poets . He had an open , wide-ranging , forward-looking mind ; and before he died in 1771 , he had anticipated many of the characteristic interests of the nineteenth century . He had sought to bring into English poetry sublimity and passion , and he had turned for quickening power to primitive and barbaric literatures  --  to mediaeval romance , to whatever was available of Welsh , Gaelic , and Scandinavian poetry . Philologist , antiquary , member of the " black-letter kennel , " he had all the isolating and unsocial enthusiasms of modern romantic scholarship ; and he could spend an entire evening in an eighteenth century drawing-room without uttering a word . After all that has been written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excuse for the indifference to the origins of nineteenth-century poetry betrayed in the essay on Gray . Mr. Jack 's only recognition of the eighteenth-century romantic current is a note referring to Arnold 's comparison of Gray 's feeling for nature with Obermann 's , and to Mr. Hudson 's enumeration of Spenserian imitations . Equally dilettanteish is his citation of a passage from Morley 's " Rousseau " by way of establishing the novelty of Wordsworth 's attitude to nature . We do not object to his availing himself of Lord Morley 's translations from the " Confessions , " but we should like to feel sure that his acquaintance extends beyond these elegant excerpts , and unhappily we do not . Wordsworth , argues Mr. Jack , was the pioneer lover of solitude and grandeur . Rousseau , on the other hand , was only the pioneer " week-ender " : " He loves Nature because she is free , quiet , and full of variety ; because , at Les Charmettes or The Hermitage , he can escape from the city . . . . In short , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtuoso in landscape who likes the confusion , the mixture , a soft smiling foreground with trees leading to a background occupied by hills . " Lord Morley is a very able writer , but on this subject Rousseau is a higher authority than Lord Morley . Why not allow Rousseau himself to tell us what he likes in landscape ? Why not let this French " week-ender " show himself in a few lines of the " Confessions " ( Part I , Book iv ) in an ecstasy of dizziness leaning for hours over a parapet near Chamberi , drunk with the foam and bellowing of blue water heard athwart the cry of crows and birds of prey flying from rock to rock hundreds of feet below him ? Au reste , on salt Ma ce que j'entends par un beau pays . Jamais pays de plaine , quelque beau qu'il fflt , ne parut tel a mes yeux . II me faut des torrents , des rochers , - des sapins , des bois noirs , des montagnes , des chemins raboteux a monter et a descendre , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peur . But Mr. Jack 's strength does not lie in historical perspective or breadth of sympathy . The virtue of his criticism resides in his intuitions , in his immediate sense of poetical values , in his spiritual tact and discrimination . For him as for Emerson  --  to whom , by the way , he pays continual tribute  --  divine ideas are not of an age but for all time ; and it is ? a comparatively insignificant matter whether Chaucer preceded Caxton or Caxton , Chaucer . From point to point through the poetry under consideration he listens for the sound of the " eternal melodies , " and summons the reader to participate in the mystical exercise of separating that which was " given " to the poet from that which he has excogitated . It is an exercise which , rightly conducted , directly disciplines the emotions and the judgment , and , perhaps more effectively than any other critical ' method , resuscitates a flagging interest in poetry . Mr ; Jack , like the critics and poets whom he most admires , believes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This dark saying can probably never be ? made plain to those whom , in his essay on Meredith , he happily characterizes as " the pedants of perspicuousness . " It has commanded the assent , nevertheless , of those who have done most to maintain in poetry the high seriousness of philosophy and religion . It is the central idea throughout this book , and it is illustrated with especial success in the essays on Arnold and Meredith , and in the first essay on Emerson . Amid the spiritual dryness of current historical criticism it is strangely refreshing to come upon interpretation that penetrates to the heart of things- like Mr. Jack 's comment on Arnold 's exquisite lines describing the chastened serenity of Iseult of Brittany in her later life with her children by the northern sea : This note of patience is heard in all Arnold 's poetry , and it is heard because his poetry is devout . It has more of the cloister , in it than is to be found in any other poetry of our time , so much more that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depth of Christian feeling and a fuller understanding of the doctrine of self-surrender than we have cepacity properly to realize . If we were to compare it with the finest attitude of a Pagan age or temper , we should see that what we have to deal with here is not the beautiful superiority to life which we find la Marcus Aurelius . . but submission to life . And so real is this temper that other poets , in their efforts to represent it , seem like boys playing with half-apprehended ideas . Put Tennyson 's " St. Agnes ' Eve " beside the passage just quoted , and how frail and external becomes that exquisite picture of the emotion of another . Compared with Arnold , Tennyson , the Broad Churchman , is a man who has heard of Christianity , and Browning , the optimist , with his Abt Vogler melodies , a brave citizen , with a Sunday mood . ? . But in the inner sanctuary of Arnold we are admitted to a place removed . ? . There is an abnegation of the private will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the perfect whole , " says Emerson , but in so saying , he seems merely to be politely aiving resistance to the claims of the universe to absorb the most persistent individuality in literature . It was a voluntary act , and Emerson is the gracious victor in that as in every contest . The tone of Arr.old is altogether different . . . . His still music comes from him in response to ideas which shake the forest of men like a reed , to which they owe their life , and which make them distinguishably human . To Arnold , the one thought that through the years comes permanently sweet is that of the life of Jesus , and the one idea that consoles , in permanent opposition to the hurry of the world , the idea of the Everlasting Studies in Honor of A. Marshall Elliott . In two volumes Baltimore : The Johns Hopkins Press $7.50 A few months ago we reviewed a volume of " Studies in Language and Literature " in celebration of the seventieth birthday of a distinguished professor ( emeritus ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notice a similar volume intended to celebrate the completion of anothe r scholar 's thirty-fifth year of service in Johns Hopkins University , as professor of the Romance languages . Alas ! the one in whose hon , , ( : ) . ? these volumes were prepared did not live to see their completion or quite to round out his thirty-fifth year of service , and so this Festschrift became a monument to the memory of a singularly engaging personality , a ripe scholar , and , above all , a devoted and enthusiastic teacher . There is no need to dwell liere upon Professor Elliott 's scholarly interests or the greet debt which the study of the Romance languages in this country owes to him . The volumes before us testify sufficiently to both , and so piofusely that we find it difficult to characterize them or to specify the various streams of infuence which they represent , We may begin , however , with a remark or two of a negative nature . The university to which is due the inception of these studies has always been supposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and scholar-snip It is pleasant , , n find in these volunes that the narrow conception of " philology " usually ascribed to Germany has been broadened the French interest in literature , both comparative and critical There are , out of twenty-seven contributions , only three relating to Romance philology in the narrowest sense , and one of these is by a foreign lecturer The other two are : " Notes on the Etymology of Bachelier ' , " by W. 0 Stowell , and " Etymological Notes " ( caclastre , cerdo , cerda ) , by D. S. Blondheim . Even the widCr and more neglecteu field of grammar has but two articles . " The French Shifts in Adjective Position and their English Equivalents , " by E C. Armstrong , and " The Italian Historical Infinitive , " by 0 M. Johnston , and of these the first is not narrowly grammatical . ' With the above may be classed the three bibliographical articles : " Problems in Medieval Fable Literature , " by G. C. Keidel ; " Notes for a Bibliography of Ame-ican Spanish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1527 Philopono , " by E. H. Wilkins . The remaining contributions may be divided roughly into texts and comment , French medieval literature , and literature , historical , critical , and comparative ( storiology ) . Two of the texts deal with medie=val fable literature , Old-French and Italian , and , with the bibliographical article cited above and some to be mentioned later , represent the work done in the Romance Seminary on a prospective edition of the fables of Marie de France . The Spanish translation ( incomplete ) of the " Decameron " published in volume II , pp. 1-235 , is out of all proportion to its value or interest and to the rest of the work . Among the articles on French medieval literature are : " The Roman du Chatelain de Couci and Pauchet 's Chronique , " by the late Professor Matzke , and " La Legende des ' Enfances ' de Charlemagne et l'Histoire de Charles Martel , " by Professor Bedier of Paris , another of the foreign lecturers . There are two papers on the French classical drama , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based on an anecdote told of Charles the Bold , " in which the writer shows that the use ci modern subjects in the French classical tragedy was not so rare as is usually stated ; in the other , " French Classical Drama and the Comedie Larmoyante , " Professor Warren endeavors to show that the latter is derived from the former , rather than from the French moralists of the late seventeenth century , or the English stage of that period The twc. literary articles of a critical nature are : " The Place of Ch  --  teaubriand as a Critic of Italian Literature , " by B. L ' Bowen , and " The Poetry of Sully-Prudhomme , " by E. P. Dargan . Finally , the class of articles relating to comparative literature or storiology is represented by contributions to the Sources of two well-known fables , an Irish analogue to the Castle of the Grail , and an article by the third foreign lecturer , Professor Menendez Pidal , on some relations between Moorish and Christian legends The above superficial review of the contents of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest and wide range of scholarship Happy the teacher who has perpetuated his influence by inspiring so large a band of youth with devotion to his own intellectual pursuits
