txt Baron Toshiro Sakatani , one of Japan 's foremost economists , former Mayor of Tokio , and a delegate to the recent Economic Conference of the Allies in Paris , said in an interview yesterday at the Hotel Astor that one of the world 's biggest economic questions to be settled after the war was the status of Jap ' anese in the United States . The Baron referred to the " justice and necessity " of the repeal of American laws regarded by the Japanese as discriminating against them . He thought this end would be obtained by peaceful means  --  through a common understanding of the two peoples of the ideals and purposes of the other . He said the Japanese desired nothing of the United States except the same treatment accorded to other civilized peoples . He called " unjust and unfair " the law which differentiates Japanese from the citizens of other foreign Countries . He said America had profited by Japan 's patrol of the Far Eastern waters , and that the United States would gain much by Japan 's maintaining the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward as the sole aim of Tokio 's participation in the affairs of China . The Baron is on his way home from the Paris conference . He arrived here Sunday , and will spend two weeks in New York , after which he will go to Vancouver to sail for Japan . It is his third visit to New York . He said the friendship of the Japanese and Americans was traditional , and that it would always continue , provided the two peoples understood one another perfectly , and he referred to the agencies of the Japanese Society in this country and of the America 's Friends Society in Japan as important factors in bringing about a complete mutual understanding . The Baron illustrated the influence of mutual trust and confidence when he was asked to comment upon the Japanese conception of the meaning of the American program for ' , a greater navy . Both Navies for - Defense . " When any great power begins to increase its armament on a sudden and ' 1 gigantic scale , " he said , " it is a matter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because of the location of the United States , protected by wide oceans , Japan saw no direct necessity for America 's great new naval program . It might have led our people to study the motive of your country . But the friendship of the two peoples is traditional . It was right , it is right , that this friendship Should accomplish good . Japan , too , is building for its navy . Now , when both sides understand that the other 's greater navy is for defensive purposes , the concern of the other for the motive back of the increase ceases to be a concern . " When the Baron was asked to tell against whom Japan wished to defend herself , his replies wore not direct . " Whom does Japan fear ? " lie was asked . " Whom does the United States fear ? " was his answer . The Baron was asked directly if he considered it fair to see in the naval program of either country a reflection Of the Japanese question in California . " No , " he answered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Japanese at first , You see , there was a gentlemen 's agreement between the two countries that there should be no great increase of Japanese immigration into this country , while the Japanese who were established here should have just and fair treatment . Japan kept her word , and Japanese immigration stopped ; the number of Japanese in this country is constantly on the decrease . Feels Crisis Hats Passed . " However much it may have hurt , we feel that the crisis has passed , and that the matter will be adjusted amicably in time . I think you must admit that it should be settled . There is no desire on the part of Japan to overrun Your country , as some of your newspapers would have you believe . You will find that , after this great war , every country will preserve its people within its boundaries . " It is the principle of the thing for which we contend ; it is the insult that hurts us . It is my dream that the peoples of the two countries shall so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the great American people will be glad to accord to the civilized and aecomplishk1 Japanese the same courtesies and rights we accord to your most welcome folk in great Japan . In the name of justice this will come to be ' I feel it must come to be . " " Japan , " he continued . ? " seeks no power of offensive : it will have ample power of defensive . " The Baron was asked if his statement that after the war it would be a case of Japan for Japanese and Japanese for Japan was any contradiction of the belief in some quarters that Japan would seek in China an outlet for surplus population . " Japan will do no such thing , " was his reply . " Japan could n't . How could we send out workmen to compete against Chinese workmen , who are cheaper ? " " But how about Japanese running factories in China with Chinese labor ? " was asked . " Ah . " he replied , " that is something different . Discus/tem China Program . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japan 's China program ? " he was asked . " Perhaps . " he smiled . " Why did Japan fight Russia ? " " Let me tell you , " he went on , " that Japan 's program in alma is to secure the open door in China for Japan and for every other country . After explaining that Japan fought 13.11$918. because Japan thought Russia was going to occupy Manchuria , and intimating that Japan would fight any one who tried to interfere with the " open door " in China , Baron Sakatani said : " What Japan wants is a square deal . We have secured a square deal for Japan in China , and we hate mama() a square deal for every one else . Japan 's open-door policy in China is a guarantee to America that she can have an open field and a fair fight for commerce in China . " It was suggested to the Baron that it was a safe stand for Japan to take in the premises because her proximity to China and cheap manufacturing facilities gave her a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All right . " he replied , " grant that . Under the law , America and all other nations have the same show if they can manufacture as cheaply . Putason your protective tariff , alike to all , and we have no objection . But here  --  your business man can go into Japan , can go into Ohina. and have a square deal . Can we come to America and get a sattare deal ? We can not . And why not ? If we arc intelligent enough and able enough to compete with the great Americans , why discriminate against us ? We want the same dpoprtunity. the same treatment , you give other civilized peoples . " o Desire for Philippines . The Baron was asked if Japan wanted the Philippines . " They belong to America . " he replied . " But if they were free ? " he was asked . " America will always - have some sort of guardianship over the Philippines , " he said . " America will not turn them adrift . The people are too irresponsible . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do in Japan . " Baron Sakatani ? showed considerable feeling when he was asked if there was any truth in the oft-repeated reports that Japanese were among the officers of Mexican troops . " That is not true . " he said , emphatically . " It is absurd . I suppose some Mexicans have been taken for Japanese . That has happened before . If there are Japanese fighting in Mexico , which I ' do n't believe , the Japanese Government knows nothing whatever of it . " The Baron characterized as canards reports that Japan had a coaling station or two in Mexico . " Reports circulated in some of your newspapers do much harm to that feeling of mutual trust which must solve all differences that might arise between the two nations , " he said . The Baron said a recent report published in a New York newspaper that all of the munitions of war supplied the Allies by Japan were made in Government plants and that the profits went to the national treasury was incorrect . " Before the war , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government factories , but since the war started , Just as has been the case in America . many private firms have gone into the munitions business and they keep the profits they make . " The Baron is known as one of Japan 's first peace advocates . He was Japan 's delegate to the Economists ' Conference held in Berne in 1911 at the instigation of the Carnegie Peace Endowment . He was Mayor of Tokio from 1912 to 1914 . Baron Sakatani was the guest of honor at a dinner held at the Century Club last night . Baron Sakatani will be entertained today at luncheon at the Lawyers ' Club . Seward Prosser will be toastmaster. and the speakers will be Baron Sakatani A. Barton Hepburn ; Darwin P. Kingsley , Lindsay Russell and Dr. T. Iyenaga.
