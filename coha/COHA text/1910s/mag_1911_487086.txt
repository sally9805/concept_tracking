Sin : In an editorial in the Nation of October 19 it is stated that " the first capital case was recently passed upon " by the English Court of Criminal Appeal , and that this case revealed the " surprising " fact that " the court is not able , under the law , to order a new trial " The case referred to is evidently Rex V. Ellson , reported in the London Times of September 29 . The judgment of the court was rendered by Mr. Justice Darling , who stated that this was " the first capital case in which the court has felt it necessary to set aside the conviction . " The first appeal in a capital case was heard by the court on July 17 , 1908 , and since then twenty such cases have been decided . It is difficult to see why the fact that the Court of Criminal Appeal has not the power to grant a new trial should be deemed surprising . The judgment of Mr. Justice Darling furnishes no ground for such surprise , for he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to repeat what the Lord Chief Justice had said before , that it appeared to the court , with the experience which it had had , that it was greatly to be regretted that they had no power in such a case to order a new trial . At the third sitting of the court on May 25 , 1908 , Lord Chief Justice Alverstone said ? It was much to be regretted that Parliament had not given the court power to order a new trial . Section 20 of the Criminal Appeal act expressly abolishes the practice of granting new trials in criminal cases , and section 4 provides that " if an appeal against conviction is allowed the court shall quash the conviction and direct a verdict and judgment of acquittal to be entered . " Twenty-seven bills giving a right of appeal to defendants in criminal cases were introduced in Parliament from 1843 to 1906 . Twenty-three of these bills provided that new trials should be allowed in certain cases The Council of Judges , held in 1894 , strongly opposed the granting of new trials , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the accused ought not to be put in " jeopardy again . " In 1906 Lord Chancellor Loreburn introduced in the House of Lords a bill providing for the establishment of a court of criminal appeal . The bill , as originally drawn , did not provide for the granting of a new trial , but this provision was later inserted by amendment The House of Lords passed the amended bill , but before it came to a second reading in the House of Commons it was withdrawn because of opposition directed partially against the provision for the granting of new trials . A bill , introduced in 1907 , denying to the court the right to grant a new trial was enacted into the present law Thus it will be seen that Parliament did intend that a defendant who had been improperly convicted should not be subjected to a second trial .

THE NATION . ENGLISH RHYTHM . To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION . SIR : In your issue of October 12 , discussing Professor Matthews 's scansion of certain lines of Browning 's , Professor Goodell objects to the indication of a pause after " Byng " in the verse . Kentish Sir Byng stood for his king asking , " Do our ears really report any period of silence ? " Since such a question invites testimony , I beg to depose that my , ears do report a period of silence in the line quoted , and still more emphatically do they report the pause after " troop " in And pressing a troop unable to stoop This difference of judgment would be of small moment , so far as these two lines are concerned , if it did not raise important allied questions regarding the cornnromises or contradictions which are involved in any system of verse notation . While I greatly prefer Mr. Matthews 's notation to Mr. Goodell 's , for such " equivalences " as have just been exemplified , I should be the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ syllables in question  --  that it is all a matter of a pause or silence It seems clear to me that a little of each method of compensation is involved , here and in all such cases , and that no single practical system of notation can represent the complex facts involved in the actual reading of these metrical feet . I prefer the caret indicating the pause , even if the pause is not the whole story , because I believe it to be a very important and characteristic story , which the student should be trained to observe . And this leads to a still more significant matter involved in Mr. Goodell 's article  --  the divergent conceptions of the true boundaries of individual feet . We are here , also , I think , in the presence of two logically irreconcilable but actually co-existent phenomena the feeling of the English reader that the foot is a fixed unit of time , and the feeling that it is ( in iambic verse ) made up of a pair of syllables Why is it that the unsophisticated reader ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at the first foot of the line , And never from this palace of dim night , as consisting of the first two syllables thereof , although no one of us would , I suppose , fail to hurry over the first syllable of " never " as Mr Goodell wishes us to do ? It may , of course , be argued that it is only because we have been trained to a false system of nomenclature and notation But the point I wish to make is that the fact that we constantly think of the feet of iambic blank verse in terms of two-syllable pairs , that we continue to think so even when presented with so unpromising a pair of " shorts " as " and nev ? , " and that we constantly make some effort to fit these pairs to the time of the rhythmical unit-foot , is as significant as the fact that our actual utterance of the verse is often inconsistent with that concept And we have very important support in the practice of the poets , since they commonly keep to multiples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the natural length of the syllables To , put the same matter more concretely , if Tennyson could conceive of a line of blank verse as divided into such feet as Mr Goodell indicates for this one , Long I lines of I cliff I breaking have I left a chasm , why did he never introduce a monosyllabic foot into this metre without an accompanying trisyllabic ? The answer seems to me to be certain : He did not think of any such monosyllabic foot ; as with most writers and readers of English verse , the concept of the two-syllable foot was as real to him as that of the time-unit foot It is important , then , to recognize the fact that ( especially in our blank verse , and to a somewhat slighter degree in the other forms of iambic pentameter ) we may and do tki , iik dissyllabic feet while actually throwing them into inconsistent time-periods . This , after all , is , perhaps , no stranger than our ability to think an accent on the last syllable of " liberty , " when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an accent to which no one ever gives utterance  --  or , for that matter , to think , as some do , that " gray " and " grey " are quite different colors , and that a ghost which through the triumph of spelling reform had lost its " h " " would also have lost its terrors . RAYMOND MACDONALD ALDEN . The University of Illinois , October 30 OLD HYMNS AND NEW CREEDS . To THE EDITOR . OF THE NATION : SIR : It is encouraging to read in an article on " Weeding Out the Hymn Books , " the Nation , of October 19 , that " there is a movement in several churches to revise their hymn books . " The other day , while searching through the book shelves in the attic for a strayed copy of Jerome 's " Editio Vulgate , " I came across an old hymn book , which by its looks invited me to open I am old enough to be familiar with many of these hymns , which I heard in my childhood , and which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be " individualism , " so to speak , and " otherworldliness , " the desire to save one 's own precious soul in another world , with no hint of the altruistic spirit that pervades our modern conceptions of religion . The burden of the hymns I looked over seems to be a longing for freedom from all activity except playing on a harp , an intense longing for rest , eternal rest . In those easy-going days , as I recall them , there was nothing of The weariness , the fever , and the fret of modern life , and I am at a loss to account for that tired feeling which the hymns express I think that most of us in this athletic age would decline a harp , and to many of us the idea of everlasting rest is as repugnant as to the ancients , who regarded it as one of the punishments of Hades . The contrast between the religious sentiment expressed in these hymns and that of to-day is strikingly shown by a report , in a Sunday paper , of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ill . According to press dispatches , the congress , " believing that the country church is failing in its purpose because it does not minister to the needs of its people in social and physical ways , as well as spiritual , adopted resolutions endorsing the idea of installing tennis courts , baseball diamonds , and providing gymnasium apparatus for its members . It was the consensus of opinion that the preacher who is unable to further the interests of his congregation by supervising their play , participating in their athletic contests , and entering into the work of improving their physical as well as mental being should be asked to quit " This leaves no doubt that we are truly living in an athletic age A part of the editorial comments on these resolutions is here quoted . The letter of the future candidate will doubtless read somewhat as follows .

Columbia . ale . ? October 29 . NOT NEWS AND NEWS . TO THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR : In a recent editorial of the Nation ( September 28 ) I find quoted a saying of Charles A. Dana ; " When a dog bites a man , that 's not news ; when a man bites a dog , that 's news . " It may interest some of your readers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which appears in the classical literatures in more than one form . Plutarch , in his " Apophthegmata Laconica " ( p. 224E ) , says that Leotychides , son of Ariston , when certain diviners announced as a portent the fact that a snake had coiled itself around the bolt of a door , replied , " It does n't seem so to me , but if the bolt had coiled itself around the snake that would be a portent . " Clement of Alexandria l " Stromata , " vii , 25 ) attributes this same remark to Diogenes , and Cicero ( " De Divinatione , " ii , 62 ) recounts it without naming its author In the lines just before those cited from the " Stromata " ( vii , 24 ) Clement says that Bion the Borysthenite remarked : " What wonder if the mouse , not finding anything to eat , has eaten the meal sack ? For this would be the thing worthy of note , if the meal sack had eaten the mouse , " and that Bion ascribed this saying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " ii , 20 ) quotes Cato. when consulted by a man whose boots had been eaten by mice , as replying that there might have been real reason for wonder if the reverse had been the case . Is the similarity between the ancient and the modern in these stories fortuitous , is it due to a reminiscence on Mr. Dana 's Part of the classics , of which he was a careful student , or is his remark based upon some intermediate form perhaps better known to him than was any one of the originals ? ARTHUR STANLEY PEASE . Urbana , Ill , October 24 TAXING SOUVENIRS . To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR . An almost pathetic side of the tariff question is seen in connection with the rule excluding trifling souvenirs from the $100 exemption of returning travellers . From our normal schools and teachers ' colleges are sent out annually hundreds of young women to teach in public schools at salaries of $400 and up  --  and not very far up . Filled with interest in their history , art , etc. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wonderful as it may seem , they do save the five or six hundred dollait that will pay the necessary travelling expenses and allow a few dollars to " spend " They do not want to buy clothing . They do want , as gifts or as treasures in memory of the great event , a bit of Dresden china or Venetian glass , a Roman lamp , a Nuremberg toy , and a few good photographs . No one article costs above two or three dollars . There could be no protection in such cases , and the revenue is so slight as to suggest that Uncle Sam will soon tax the pennies in the babies ' banks . M. B. P. Ypsilanti , Mich. , October 17 . Literature THE MYSTIC LIFE . Mysticism : A Study in the Nature and Development of Man 's Spiritual Consciousness . By Evelyn Underhill , New York : E. P. Dutton &; Co. $5 net . With the modest title of An Introduction to Mysticism , we are here offered an unusually complete guide to the interior or hidden life , admirable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a subject which has been so often associated with quite the opposite qualities . After the vagaries of the so-called New Thought one is relieved to find so sane a study of what has been the old thought upon the transcendental order . The distinction between the sensible and the supersensible furnishes that valid double interpretation which is generally characteristic of this book . Any experience in the mystic way , we are told , may be looked at from two points of view : we may see it , with the psychologist , as a moment in the history of mental development , governed by the more or less mechanical laws which so conveniently explain to him the psychic life of man ; or , with the mystic himself , we may see it as a step toward that goal of mystical activity where there is " everywhere one Being , one Life . " Taking , then , as her point of departure the assumption that the supersensible is somehow important , and can be influenced by the activities of man , the author makes an ingenious approach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half-way house inhabited by the Vitalists . Vitalism is called the first contribution of the twentieth century to the history of man 's quest of " reality , " and is rightly described as being in its theory of knowledge close to that of the mystics . It is , moreover , a brilliant stroke to describe Driesch and Bergson and Eucken as having turned materialism inside out in that they present to us the universe as an expression of life , not life as an expression and by-product of the universe . It is true that the Vitalists in their theory of knowledge are close to the mystics , but it will not do to over-em , phasize that fact . Driesch , indeed , revives the doctrine of the entelechy , or spiritual principle , but does not lose sight of the physical organism ; Bergson employs intuition but bases it upon biology ; and Eucken calls upon the life of the spirit but does not forget the lower of the two levels  --  the natural . In their theory of knowledge these men may be idealists , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scarcely agree with the statement that the only escape from skepticism is by recourse to man 's innate but strictly irrational instinct for that " Real above all reason , beyond all thought . " This is only one side , even of mysticism , for elsewhere the author herself acknowledges that there is a dual character to the spiritual consciousness : first , there is the union with Life , with the World of Becoming ; and parallel with it the illumination by which the mystic " gazes upon a more veritable world . " Here , as generally throughout the book , the writer uses a consistent parallelism : the transcendental is her quest , but the temperamental is that necessary instrument whereby the sensuous symbol is so traced as to make it known that all mystics come from the same country . It is a safe road that has two straight sides , fixed lines that lie in strict parallelism . Hence in the succeeding chapter on mysticism and psychology it is unfortunate that the description of the former in the terms of the latter is so strongly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular psychology to personify and exalt the subconscious ; Americans know too well how the subliminal self has been turned into a waste-basket for all sorts of rubbish . Yet it seems going too far to say , after using the works of Cutten and Starbuck and James , that , - when science attempts to lift the veilpf Isis , she leaves only her dirty finger-marks behind . But such disparagement is perhaps more strictly directed against the French school and the researches of Murisier , Janet , and Ribot , who strive to find a pathological taint in all mystic experiences . The sanity of true mysticism may be shown , as here , by the comparative method . If the French have had representatives of the feminine hysterical type , such as Madame Guyon , the Germans have had the more virile representatives , such as Suso and Tauler . In the chapter on the characteristics or mysticism an interesting attempt is made to substitute for William James 's celebrated four marks of the mystic state another set of four , less inclusive , but possibly more precise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not passive and theoretical ; its aims wholly transcendental and spiritual ; its object one of love , not of exploration ; its goal , not intellectual realization , but a form of enhanced life . In general , the mark of the real practitioner is not to know about but to be , and , it is illogically added , it is the art of establishing one 's conscious relation with the Absolute . But how can one be in conscious relation and yet , as is said earlier , deny that possible knowledge is to be limited to any process of " mtellectation " ? As Benjamin Franklin would say ? " This is a kind of light about which I am much in the dark . " The denial of any intellectual element in the mystic process is a pitfall : besides causing a neglect of the historic stage of illumination it does not fully agree with what is offered as one of the best modern definitions of mysticism as " in essence the concentration of all the forces of the soul upon a supernatural object " ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ladder the Christian Platonists and mystical philosophers , who are described as being no more mystics than the milestones on the Dover road are travellers to Calais . Pointing out the ccnfusing fact of an initial similarity of expression between many of the proceedings of the mystic and of the occultist , the author passes from the spurious to the genuine phenomena of the movement . In this second part of the book on the Mystic Way , the main strength of this study is shown in its thorough familiarity with the literature of Western mysticism from the beginnings of the Christian era to the death of William Blake . The dry facts of that period are given in a valuable appendix and bibliography , a sympathetic interpretation in minute descriptions of the Awakening , the Purification , and the Illumination of the self as drawn from the classic sources . Here , besides previously untranslated fragments from Meister Eckhart and Mechtild of Magdeburg , there are copious extracts from such exquisite " tasters of supreme experience " as Julian of Norwich and St John of the Cross . But these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Scul and the ' Unitive Life might well nave been supplemented by extracts from certain of the genuine American mystics  --  among the Puritans Jonathan Edwards , among the Pennsylvania Pietists Conrad Beissel , among the moderns Upham , author of " The Interior or Hidden Life . " We have an unbroken strain of the mystic ichor in our veins ; Miss Underhill discovers it in Professor Royce , she might be interested to know that it is to be found in other academic circles besides Harvard , and that even from Columbia University there has come a mystic manual worthy to be ranked among the classics of the contemplative way .
