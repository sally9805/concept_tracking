DEFEAT Germany first ; reconstruction will take care of itself " ? such is too frequently the attitude of Americans towards the proposal to begin planning reconstruction today . It is an understandable attitude . The almost fatally necessary condition for any large social or popular action is that the general community intelligence shall be focussed on one thing at a time . To ask the popular mind to keep two objects in view simultaneously is almost like asking a child to get up and lie down at a single command . Dividing popular attention is like splitting an army in two . Mass action derives its effectiveness largely from the intensity of its purpose . Yet none of these observations , however true or pointed they may be in themselves , really applies to the actual facts as they are today . For reconstruction is not something to follow after the war ; it is part of the war itself . We ought not to say : " We shall begin to plan for reconstruction as soon as a victorious peace is in sight . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in so far as we have already reconstructed our national life from top to bottom have we a right to be sure that a victorious peace will ever come in sight . And that process of reconstructing our national life has already gone much deeper than mere changes in organization of our resources . It is psychological . We have begun to think in large-scale terms . We have begun to see the workings of cause and effect from an entirely new angle . The common man has become more vitally interested in the problems of economics and industry than were formerly the theorists of the universities . To shivering tenement-dwellers the question of coal distribution has become something more than an academic problem . When victory in the field is seen to demand cold houses at home , the policy of the draft boards with respect to essential industries becomes of lively personal interest to every coal-consumer . When the lesson of one lump of sugar at the breakfast table and months of wheatless days has taught us that patriotism involves much more than waving a flag , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baseball scores . In a word , waging a modern war is reconstruction in itself . Winning the war has proved not to be so simple as in the old days of romantic combat . It is a large-scale , corporate undertaking . Whether we know it or not , we are talking reconstruction every day . We are thinking it and working at it . And there is a second reason ? perhaps less material , but certainly as insistent ? why we must begin at once to plan deliberately for reconstruction . We are committed as a matter of honor to a new world , a world of democracy in which wars will be made impossible , or at least more difficult than they have ever been in the past . Pledged to no selfish nationalistic aims of our own , we have begun to realize that our task in this war is not merely to win peace , but to keep the peace after it is won . We know now that there can be no return to the status quo ante . And we are beginning also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we must create a new world industrially , financially , economically , just as certainly as a new world politically . This will demand every ounce of our energy for constructive planning . As a matter both of immediate necessity and future policy we can not postpone this planning until the peace conference meets . We can not enter the state of peace with the same degree of unpreparedness with which we entered the state of war . For the day that formal hostilities end , the war on the problems which will then face the world will begin . We dare not face them unprepared . All this is making us uneasy . We are beginning to ask questions . They are sharp and pressing questions . Will the coal shortage , for example , continue during the winter of 1919-20 , as we know it is bound to do this next winter ? For how many years and to what extent will it continue after the signing of peace ? How can it be remedied ? Will state control be extended or relaxed ? What will be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned soldiers ? What will be the state of industry ? There are hundreds of equally insistent questions , each demanding an intelligent and foresighted  | answer , if peace is not to mean merely economic and industrial chaos . But before we can approach to anything like an answer for any of these questions indeed before we can even explicitly formulate them we need to take something of a survey of the mate ? rials with which we already have ? and in increasing measure will have ? to deal . There is , first of all , the human material . It is pretty generally agreed that the returned soldier will dominate the civilian population . It is hardly likely that groups of intriguing business men or of politicians will be able , so easily as in the past , to direct the entire flow of popular opinion and action . Now there are two distinct views about the returned soldier . One plausible view is that the soldier will be so fed up with conflict and strife that he will be glad to return to the quietest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear the birds twitter in the tree-tops . Modern warfare , for the larger proportion of common soldiers after the training period is over , is often a long period of loafing interrupted by occasional flares of intense activity . Coupled with this is the indisputable fact that many men will be unwilling to return to the dull routine of clerical or factory life which they knew before the war . In other words , the men who come home will be both by habit and inclination potential loafers who can be exploited by the most unscrupulous demagogue . And in proof of this view its defenders point to the apathy of the Russian peasant soldiers since demobilization . Yet equally plausible are those who argue just the contrary . According to that view , men so long inured to violence will be willing to take a chance on anything . Observing that the state can spend incredible sums on destruction and yet continue as a going concern , the returned soldiers will fail to be impressed with the argument that social experiments cost too much ; after all , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social experiment themselves . As President Wilson has himself said , they will not come back contentedly to the " economic servitude " which they knew before the war . And , ironically enough , the supporters of this view also point to Russia for confirmation . The probabilities are however that both views are somewhat overemphasized . What we do know , when we strip off all glamour and myth , is that modern war is like a tremendously large-scale industrial enterprise , with the human risks appreciably greater than in ordinary industry . Everything is mechanical ? transportation , guns , aeroplanes , mining , signals , high explosives , food , even " morale " as organized in scientific campaigns in the newspapers . That habit of mind which Mr. Thorstein Veblen has so well exposed as the result of the common man 's coming into intimate contact with machine technology will probably be increased rather than lessened . It is a habit of mind which is subversive of the conventional views of national integrity , business freedom , and vested interests . It is both skeptical and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will encounter what the human spirit always encounters ? the facts of the world as they are . For the bare physical facts of the world as it will be on the conclusion of hostilities constitute the second set of materials with which we shall have to deal . Much will have been destroyed . The impoverishment of resources will be real . Herds will have been killed off , and re-breeding will take anywhere from five to ten years . The statistics of world production in essential grains show an absolute rather than relative decrease for the last three years . The iron and coal and chemicals used for purely war purposes can never be recaptured . Furthermore , this condition of positive impoverishment will be heightened by the fact that the demand for the essentials will be notably increased ? people will not so willingly accept sacrifices as when an external enemy is attacking . As Gambetta says , " after danger is past , troubles begin . " It is clear that after the war we shall have an increased need and an increased demand . Fortunately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an increased productive capacity such as it has never had before in its history ? America more than the rest . We have learned lessons in the wastes of ordinary business competition , lessons in the pooling of interests , lessons in effective " speeding up , " lessons in undemocratic control of industry ( as a detriment to production ) , lessons in the increased use of woman power , lessons in organization . In spite of the drain of war and the removal of millions of workers to the firing lines , the foreign trade of Great Britain has increased rather than decreased . After the war , although we shall have paid a high price for it , we shall at least have learned some of the secrets of rapid and large-scale production . In all probability the period following the war will be a period of tremendous expansion and activity . Our chief business , if we are to remain faithful to the generous pledges under which we entered the war , is to make this heightened industrial and commercial activity avoid the folly of dividing into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-conscious and purposively narrow . It must be organized on  | an international basis or we merely repeat on an exaggerated scale the incentives to war which were characteristic of the nineteenth century . There will be many who will try to prevent this . In every country we can see the politicians , those in a dominant economic or industrial position , those with the aura of unearned prestige still about them , attempting to make what Mr. J. A. Hobson has called so well the " closed state . " At the very time that so many leaders are telling us to concentrate all our energies on the war it is well to remember that schemes for industrial and commercial reconstruction are already in many instances faits accomplis . Governments and commercial classes may preach nothing except war to the populace , but as a matter of fact much of their thought and attention is absorbed in the problems of trade and finance after the war . The British Union League is an example : it preaches protection , imperial preference , the development of " key " industries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France back the general recommendations of the Paris Economic Conference . Even in our own country chambers of commerce and similar bodies are laying nationalistic and , in some cases , imperialistic plans . Much of this proposed reconstruction contemplates social legislation of a palliative sort , better housing conditions , and is sympathetic to reformist , as distinguished from radical , ideals . After all , the business men and industrial experts have the exact and detailed knowledge on which any scientific plan for reconstruction must be based , as even the Soviet government of Russia discovered and utilized . And it is part of the mythology of radicalism to picture all those in powerful positions as necessarily malicious . Often their conservatism is merely ignorance ; already business men are seeing beyond the individual industry to national organization , as ? ventually they must see through to international Drganization . Their advice and help will be invaluable . And they possess a fund of genuine good . will . Liberals however can not allow this planning to be done entirely by the interested classes ; nor will they . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but they can not ) e allowed to dictate policy , which must be adjusted : n the interests of the whole community . Labor s more alive and intelligent than ever before , not readily succumbing to the old shibboleths . That can ) e plainly seen in the program of the British Labor Party , and in the program generally of the Socialsts on the continent . Unless there is reconciliation , ve shall find on one side the old-fashioned point of view , given an up-to-date state socialist vocabulary and on the other the vision of internationalism ? vision , as its opponents call it , but an attitude really more consonant with the actual facts of large-scale industry , scattered raw materials , transportation , and international interdependence as they exist in 1918 . This struggle between conflicting points of view may be adjusted reasonably by acquiescence to the new order ; it may be bitter . During the period of dislocation following demobilization each side will try to catch the advantage . National passions will inevitably be played upon ? for the most part , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychological let-down , such as accompanies the end of all wars , and a perfectly human tendency to throw over all attempts for rational reorganization and to enjoy life while we may . The franker and bolder imperialists in all states will try to exploit the desire for national economic security ? as Mr. Hughes is doing in Great Britain ? and to capture the control of a tired world . But many things will play against them . Anger at all sorts of profiteering is very real today ; much of it has been suppressed in the interest of national unity before the external enemy but it will flare up again with peace . When the reaction comes men will look back with more than the conventional horror to this war . Its emotional appeal is even now thin , as we have seen in its rather jejune expressions in literature and art . It is almost talked out . There are few who have talked to soldiers frankly who say that they detect any inclination on the part of the men who have been through the whole range of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jealous and competing groups . After the procuring of bread , the preservation of peace has come more and more to the worker to seem his primary interest . And there is a final and definitive point : the mechanical and technical facts of the modern world , with its emphasis on international economic cooperation , can not be wished away . Ideas must eventuanlly conform and adapt themselves to them . A skeptical attitude towards reconstruction would perhaps be justified if there had not already been distinctly discernible a shift of interest away from the romantic and suicidal questions of national or political prestige to the more basic questions of ) organization and control of industry , the allocation ) f raw materials , the necessary peace-time interna:ional fiscal system and exchange of credits , the direction of the flow of capital , the rates arrangements For the new international merchant marine . In the =ace of what the world is really like today , the  | complete irrelevancy of the nineteenth century con cepts of national sovereignty is becoming increasing ly clear . It is not that direct frontal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spon taneously and unerringly shifted away from them It has centered on new questions . And in America today these questions confron us not only as a matter of immediate interest it winning the military side of the war but as the ever more important challenge of preserving the fruit of that victory . Some of the questions are unesca pable : Shall federal control of transportation ant other public utilities be abandoned after the war ' Have we any plan for the simultaneous and pro portionate reduction of competitive armaments in al countries ? How shall the war debt be paid ? Hov can we make sure of markets for our products and a the same time avoid the risk of making other state : jealous ? What is the future of our rapidly increas ing merchant marine ? What are our plans concern ing immigration ? How shall industry be reorgan ized and what hereafter shall be the status of labor ' Shall the principle of priority rights be recognizec in law and extended , or shall we return to the olc laissez-faire doctrines of competitive business ? Shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Emergency Fleet Corporation , the Fuel and Food Administrations , the Federal Trade Board be continued ? If so , who and what are to determine their policies ? How are our soldiers to be fitted into the new economic and industrial life when they return home ? What arrangements are we making for demobilization ? To what international political policies are we preparing to commit ourselves ? Are we willing to abandon some of our claims to complete sovereignty and have our investments in weak and disorganized countries , if not directed , at least subject to the control of an international authority ? These questions are insistent . Not only our own happiness in the coming strange days of peace depends upon our answer to them , but the happiness of those unknown generations for whom , as we are so often rhetorically told , all this anguish and horror are so freely given . These future generations may be grateful that we gave so generously of our lives . But they will profit from it only if today we give as generously of our intelligence .  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
