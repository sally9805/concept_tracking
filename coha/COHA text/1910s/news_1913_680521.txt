SULZER to-day and present to him as earnestly as they can  --  which will be no more earnestly than the facts justify  --  the injury to public interests that will result if the appropriations asked for by the Superintendent and managers of the Bedford Reformatory should be cut down as his Economy Commission advised . The efficiency of that admirable institution is already endangered by overcrowding , and unless its facilities and accommodations are enlarged the City Magistrates will be obliged to commit to the Workhouse many unfortunate girls in desperate need of the influences to which they would be subjected at Bedford . A Workhouse sentence , with the resulting association with older and hopelessly depraved women , in effect deprives the " first offender " of her one chance to escape from the path upon which she has entered .

In a recent letter to the President of the Reformatory , Chief Magistrate MeAnoo described as " grave " the existing situation , and expressed the keen regret of himself and his colleagues at the necessity under which they are placed by Bedford 's crowded condition of dealing with the girls brought before them from the streets in a way which , as he said , does not act as a deterrent , affore.s no means of reformation , and aggravates the evil . To fine these women only forces them to work the harder at their deplorable calling to secure the funds with which to escape imprisonment . No more money has been asked for Bedford than can be utilized there to high advantage , and the full amount should be given , if for no other and better reason than because to cut it down will compel much larger expenditures for the maintenance and control of habitual criminals whom this " economy " will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to minds congenitally lacking in both , but it can and does put their possessors in a better environment and develops whatever capacities for good may be in them .

This argument is neatly met in a circular just issued by the National Association of Audubon Societies . What the loss would be , it says , can not be accurately computed because the customs records do not discriminate between feathers imported for decorative uses and those consumed in the manufacture of pillows and quilts . Of the aigrettes , by far the most valuable of all feathers , 90 per cent . arrive in the crude state and pay duty on the low foreign valuation of from $15 to $20 an ounce .

If any boys run away nowadays it is not to sea , or , if a few do , their fireroom experiences do not lead to fame or wealth .
