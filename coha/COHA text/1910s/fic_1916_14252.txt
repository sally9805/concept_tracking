SCENE : A large , cold , and formal room done in pale green with mauve portires and upholstery . The decorator chose furnishings with care and taste , but he neglected the most important feature : the room is as cheerful as a mausoleum . At the back , to the right , a row of windows overlooking the street . On the left , well upstage , a wide , arched opening leading to the hall . Downstage right an empty fireplace . Above it a doorway ; above the doorway , a screen . Hidden from view behind the screen a small scroll-saw . In the centre of the room stands a round table ; straight-backed chairs to left and right of it . A third chair downstage left , and a fourth at the back near the screen . A davenport before the fireplace . Bell-rope at back to the left . A small table near it which the butler uses as a serving table . Two heavy candlesticks ,  --  about three feet tall , on either side of the fireplace . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Grant on the mantel-piece . On the centre table a vase of Candidum lilies . The one bright , inharmonious thing in the room is a navajo blanket which lies over the back of the davenport . The light of a late , sunless afternoon in April comes through the windows . The curtain rises on an empty stage . Presently a youngish man enters from the hall . He is tall and slender , handsome and distingu . Beggars never dare approach him . He wears a cutaway and silk hat , and has a gardenia for boutonnire . His eyes immediately discover the navajo . He frowns ; then moves to the bell-rope and pulls it . Coming downstage he seats himself in the chair at the left of the table . He is obviously much annoyed but he does not drop his long-practiced posing . The butler enters right . He 's sparse and tall ; and although well in his fifties , he has never acquired a sense of humor . He has not expected to see the youngish man , and even a slight expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and immediately becomes a proper property of the house . GILBERT pointing to the navajo with his stick ; does not turn his headEnright , who put that barbaric atrocity there ? p. 3 ENRIGHT moving to the navajoYes , sir . GILBERT Why does Father insist on spoiling this room ? ENRIGHT puts the navajo on his arm as though he were in the habit of taking things away at the young man 's commandI do my best , Mr. Gilbert . GILBERT Take it away . It absolutely ruins the effect . ENRIGHT Often the best of people seem to be born with no taste , sir . GILBERT Wrap it up and send it to one of the pseudos in Greenwich Village . It 'll be appreciated there . ENRIGHT feeling it his cue to laughExcellent , sir . Mr. Grant  --  momentary pause ; the mention of Grant , Senior , brings some thought to his mind  --  perhaps , sir ,  --  will you be so good as to choose a blanket of the right colour ? GILBERT Any blanket would be out of place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir , Mr. Grant likes something to cover himself with . GILBERT showing a slight interest ; up to this time his manner has been marked by complete boredomDoes Father nap here ? p. 4 ENRIGHT Yes , sir . I suppose he should nap in his bed ; but  --  GILBERT cutting inThis is n't a bedroom . ENRIGHT Very good , sir . Crosses and lights the chandelier . GILBERT It may be necessary to remove the davenport . Enright busies himself with anything which will provide an excuse for lingering . ENRIGHT Mr. Grant will be so pleased that you 're to dine with him . GILBERT very boredBut I 'm not . Enright 's face falls . GILBERT I trotted in to tell you to send me round a few bottles of Father 's burgundy . He never uses it , I suppose ? ENRIGHT No , sir . He will be disappointed that you 're not to dine with him . An idea comes to him : if he tells Gilbert his trouble the son will put an end to it . He speaks with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Park for some one . GILBERT astounded ; even turns abruptly and looks at EnrightWhat ? ENRIGHT very solemnlyYes , sir . Almost every night for three weeks now . p. 5 GILBERT horrifiedMy father dines with tramps ? ENRIGHT still in tragic voiceThat night he went with you to the theatre . Seems something in the play put the idea in his head . GILBERT This comes of taking him to the theatre . Gilbert will never take him again . ENRIGHT his tone conveys that he does not understand Grant 's distasteHe says he ca n't bear to dine alone . GILBERT Tramps off the street . How many  --  since I was here last ? ENRIGHT thinkingThat was three weeks ago . GILBERT forgetting himself for a momentSo long ? Checking himselfHow do you remember ? ENRIGHT You came to go over the accounts , sir . GILBERT Why , this is awful ! ENRIGHT Is n't it a tragedy , sir ? GILBERT I do n't understand him . ENRIGHT as though no one couldNo , sir . p. 6 GILBERT And do these  --  these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tried to bring one of them in at the service entrance . But Mr. Grant objected . He was quite unreasonable about it , sir . GILBERT evidently planning to give his father a lectureI think I 'll stay for dinner tonight . ENRIGHT relieved and delightedOh splendid ! GILBERT No , I ca n't . Tonight is Reggie Schofield 's bachelor farewell . ENRIGHT giving way completelyI do n't know what to do , sir ,  --  butlering to tramps . GILBERT I 'll run in soon . I ca n't have my father dining with tramps . It 'd ruin me . You tell him  --  ENRIGHT cutting inOh , no . I could n't , sir . Beg pardon , sir , but could you wait ? GILBERT I 'm late now . I 've only time to dress . Rises and moves rather hurriedly toward the hall . Stops left lower as : William Grant enters from the hall . He 's a small , undersized man of sixty-seven , but he looks even older and his hair is snow-white . His voice is light and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embarrassment in his manner . He wears a dark overcoat . In one hand he holds his top-hat ; in the other , a bunch of bright red tulips . In all , a pathetic figure ; but he beams when he sees Gilbert and goes eagerly to him with outstretched hand. p. 7 GRANT Oh Gilbert , I 'm so glad to see you . How are you ? How are you ? GILBERT Oh , so so . I 've been waiting for you for some time . GRANT I 'm so sorry to have kept you . But sit down , sit down . Enright , take Mr. Gilbert 's hat . GILBERT I 'm just off . GRANT Oh , no . You have n't dined with me in twenty-one nights . GILBERT I 've really not a moment . I must see a sick friend . GRANT Well , if you 're going to cheer some one up , I 'll have to excuse you . But do come soon . TimidlyIt 's lonesome . GILBERT Why do n't you dine at the Club ? GRANT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be any one there I know . GILBERT I 'll come soon . There 's something I must talk to you about . GRANT brightensWhat ? GILBERT Do n't you know ? Grant shakes his head . GILBERT I have n't a moment now . The hospital will be closed to visitors . Moves out into the hall . Au revoir . Grant stands looking after him . Enright puts the navajo behind a pillow . Crosses to Grant and helps him out of his coat ; takes his hat . Grant moves to the table ; takes the lilies from the vase and puts the tulips in their place. p. 8 ENRIGHT with a slight restraining gestureAh ,  --  the colour , sir . GRANT Colour ? Oh , yes . Removes the tulips , puts the lilies back in the vase . Gilbert knows best . Hands the tulips to Enright . ENRIGHT Will you have your dinner in here tonight , sir ? GRANT I think it 's more cheerful than the dining room ENRIGHT Yes , sir . Grant sits on the davenport . Enright puts the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the hall . Grant sighs . Enright reenters . Grant speaks immediately . GRANT Enright , do you know what day this is ? ENRIGHT No , sir . What , sir ? GRANT My sixty-seventh birthday . ENRIGHT No , sir ? Not really , sir ? May I congratulate ? GRANT Thank you , Enright . Not bitterlyOne usually does n't mention his own birthday , but no one remembered , so I had to tell . ENRIGHT apologizing for GilbertI 'm sure , sir , if Mr. Gilbert 'd  --  p. 9 GRANT cutting in ; excusing Gilbert from obligationI did n't expect him to . Why should children remember their parents ' birthdays ? With a twinkle in his eyeThey were n't present at our christenings , were they , Enright ? ENRIGHT not seeing Grant 's poor little jokeAh no , sir . Enright picks up the tulips and goes out right . After a moment of doing nothing , and as though trying to brace up , Grant takes a puzzle ,  --  a couple of nails bent together , from his pocket , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tray holding dinner service . ENRIGHT A new puzzle , sir ? GRANT separating the nailsYes . It 's too easy . ENRIGHT begins laying the tableYou 're so clever with them . GRANT They 're all alike . ENRIGHT Did you win at Canfield today , sir , or did Canfield beat you ? GRANT Why ,  --  I ca n't remember . I guess I 've got in the habit of just laying out the cards . I wish I knew a new game . ENRIGHT I 'll ask my mother . She knows one she says Napoleon played to keep himself from going insane . p. 10 GRANT Oh , do . Thoughtfully ; almost shivers " From going  --  . " QuicklyTake your mother some of my jig-saw puzzles . ENRIGHT **25;1742;TOOLONG you , sir . GRANT What else does she do to keep herself busy ? ENRIGHT Oh , she has a real smart time living with sister . The neighbors are always dropping in to borrow something . GRANT It is different with a woman . An old man  --  Pauses . ENRIGHT Shall I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ENRIGHT Oh , but you must eat , sir . Cook gets so cross . Grant rises and moves to the table as though he were performing an unpleasant duty . Enright holds the chair at the right of the table for him . Grant is about to sit when an idea pops into his head . He speaks eagerly and tries to be persuasive . GRANT Enright , you have dinner with me tonight . ENRIGHT shaking his head ; he has evidently refused more than onceNo , sir . p. 11 GRANT Just for tonight . My birthday . ENRIGHT I could n't and keep my dignity , sir . Grant sits . Enright pushes his chair up to the table . He unfolds the napkin and gives it to Grant ; goes out . Grant smells the lilies ; shudders slightly . Enright enters . He is the perfect , silent butler now . He carries a small tray ; puts it on the table near Grant ; goes out . Grant takes the pill from the tray , looks at it for a moment , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Enright enters ; serves Grant with an hors d'oeuvre ; picks up the tray and goes out . Grant looks at the hors d'oeuvre ; shoves the plate forward a little . The ticking of the clock is the only sound . Enright enters with a dish of celery and olives ; puts it on the table . He looks down at the hors d'oeuvre . Grant shakes his head . Enright picks up the plate and moves toward the door . Grant speaks . GRANT Do you remember that tall man who was here ? ENRIGHT his face shows that he is alarmed , but he speaks quietlyYes , sir . GRANT He told me that he and his wife and five children live together in two rooms . How jolly they must be ! Enright goes out ; reenters with the soup . Grant is looking off into space . Enright notices the chair which seems to mark the empty place opposite Grant ; he quickly sets it against the wall ; exit . Enters with the crackers ; leaves . Deadly , deadly silence follows . Grant thinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He breaks off quickly , frightened . He clinches his hands and shakes his head as though trying to throw off the mood . But the silence , the coldness only impress themselves upon him the more . The clock marks the time monotonously . Desperately , Grant picks up a spoon , starts to taste the soup . But he drops the spoon and bursts out GRANT I ca n't stand it ! I ca n't . RisesEnright ! Enright ! Enright enters . He knows what is to happen . GRANT You must get me some one . He goes rapidly to the windows . Already he feels better . Look ! Quick ! Enright approaches the windows . ENRIGHT Which one , sir ? GRANT Any one . Ask him if he wo n't please come . Enright goes to the table to remove the soup . GRANT Never mind . The man first . Hurry , hurry . Enright moves toward the hall . Grant hurries up to him . GRANT Give me the keys . That wine Gilbert had me buy . We 'll celebrate my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left distastefully and as slowly as he dares . Grant eagerly crosses the room . As he passes the table he realizes that his guest will know the meal had been commenced . Carefully , yet hurriedly , folds his napkin , picks up the soup-plate and goes out right . Enright enters left with the man following . The latter is almost as old as Grant but he appears much younger . His hair and full beard are still very dark , without the least touch of grey . He is tall and powerfully built but he drags his feet lazily . He suit is shabby but quite spotless . Enright loses no time in lowering the window shades. p. 13 ENRIGHT coldly and disdainfullyPlease understand , he 's not crazy . VANBRUGH his voice is heavy in sharp contrast to Grant'sThen why did you  --  ? ENRIGHT cutting inHis guests disappointed him , and he 's kind-hearted , and thought you looked hungry . VANBRUGH He thought right . Sits left lower ; puts his felt hat in the chair , takes a small brush from his pocket , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whistles contentedly . After a disgusted glance at the man , Enright goes out right hurriedly ; returns almost immediately and lays another place at table . VANBRUGH What 's my host 's name ? ENRIGHT proudlyMr . William Grant . VANBRUGH Bill Grant ? Starts ; looks up for a moment ; then puts the brush in his pocket and goes on whistling . Enright goes out right as Grant enters . GRANT embarrassed ; advances toward his guestHow do you do , sir ? I 'm so glad you 've come . p. 14 VANBRUGH rises and holds out his hand . He 's perfectly at his ease , and seems to recognize GrantExceedingly kind of you to ask me to dine with you . GRANT surprisedIt 's very good of you to come . VANBRUGH Too bad your other guests disappointed you . GRANT I had no other guests . I invited you because I wished company . VANBRUGH Oh , I see  --  Laughs  --  the butler  --  GRANT surprisedYou 're not like the  --  Collects himself as he sees Enright who has entered and stands waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Motions to place at left of table . VANBRUGH Thank you . Enright pushes Grant 's chair to the table . The man sits . Enright goes out . There is a pause . The man waits for Grant to speak . VANBRUGH finally making conversationSplendid spring , is n't it ? GRANT Yes . VANBRUGH Think the rains are over ? p. 15 GRANT I do . Do you ? Enright enters with the soup ; serves them ; exit . The man begins to eat eagerly . Grant watches him . VANBRUGH It 's a long time since I had dinner with you . GRANT Dinner with me ? VANBRUGH Yes . GRANT But  --  ? VANBRUGH Do n't you recognize me ? GRANT No . VANBRUGH I 'm Courtleigh Vanbrugh . GRANT Courtleigh Vanbrugh  --  why , it ca n't be ! VANBRUGH Why not ? GRANT The man in my class of ' 72 ? VANBRUGH The same . Courtleigh Vanbrugh , poet , philosopher , naturalist . GRANT But we expected  --  Pauses . VANBRUGH Big things ? I 've done them . GRANT greatly pleasedWhy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible  --  I 've not seen you in over forty years . VANBRUGH enjoying his soup tremendouslyA long time for lots to happen . p. 16 GRANT Not many of us alive now . VANBRUGH Suppose not . Enright enters ; serves the next course and the wine ; exit . GRANT with tears in his eyesWhy , this is wonderful ,  --  to dine with a classmate . Vanbrugh is paying more attention to his food than to Grant 's conversation . GRANT I did n't know many of them intimately at college , but as I think of them now , they seem like boon companions . I feel I know them better than most any one in the world . VANBRUGH You have n't seen me in over forty years . GRANT Just think of that ! VANBRUGH Have n't you something to tell me ? GRANT I ? VANBRUGH Yes . You feel you know me so well . GRANT About what ? VANBRUGH Yourself . GRANT slight pauseWhy ,  --  I was married in ' 78 . My wife died eight years later . VANBRUGH insistentlyTell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GRANT Father left me quite a sum and the business . Now Gilbert 's taken it over . VANBRUGH What was your business ? GRANT Wholesale millinery . I wish you could have known my wife . Elise was such a wonderful woman . VANBRUGH almost grufflyI want to know what 's brought you to the position where you have to call people off the street to dine with you . GRANT I do n't exactly know . My wife and I were so happy . I spent all my time when I was n't working with her and the baby . Then she died , and Gilbert and I were alone . Then he went to prep school and college  --  and , well ,  --  when he came back we did n't seem to know each other as we used to . It 's strange but I guess it always happens . VANBRUGH Where does he live ? GRANT At his club . You know , a house is n't a home unless there 's a mother there . When I married , I got out of the habit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my family , I lost track of friends ,  --  and somehow I could n't get started again . I was too old . So I just live here alone . VANBRUGH Why did n't you marry again ? GRANT Oh , no ! There was just one little woman and she died thirty years ago . Vanbrugh stretches his hand along the table and pats Grant 's affectionately as he might a child's. p. 18 GRANT I retired five years ago . I did n't want to , but Gilbert said it was n't right for a man of my age and position to work . He said it did n't look well . Since then things have been worse . I have n't anything to do , and  --  sometimes  --  it gets so lonesome  --  that I  --  well , it seems I ca n't stand it . Then one night Gilbert took me to the theatre . A man in the play used to invite people in . He was n't lonesome , but  --  VANBRUGH Well , I 'm not surprised you do . Looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creeps . GRANT Gilbert designed it . He say it 's quite correct , and he 's an aesthete . VANBRUGH Aesthete be damned ! It 's as correct and beautiful as a winter landscape . But who in hell wants to sit in the snow ! GRANT I 'm so sorry . What can I do ? VANBRUGH risingWhy , get some colour and life here . CallingHere , man . To GrantWhat 's your butler 's name ? GRANT bewilderedEnright . VANBRUGH callingEnright ! Enright ! Snatches the lilies from the vase . Enright enters p. 19 VANBRUGH Take these funeral flowers out of here . Get me some bright ones . Goes to fireplace . Bring some good , big logs and build a fire . ENRIGHT to GrantYou 're cold , sir ? VANBRUGH Yes , in body and soul . Enright goes out right with the lilies . Grant has risen . Vanbrugh goes to the davenport ; turns it round ; picks up a pillow . VANBRUGH Baah ! discovers the navajoHa , who let this in ? GRANT timidly I snooze in it . VANBRUGH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screen ; sees scroll-saw . What in the devil 's this ? GRANT My scroll-saw . I cut jig-saw puzzles . Vanbrugh , whistling a lively tune , moves the screen down in back of the table , making a sort of wall with it , and fastens the navajo over the screen . Grant watches , helpless and amazed . VANBRUGH Say , what is your son ? A collector of melancholia paraphernalia ? He must be like the people who voted for prohibition . Enright enters with a basket of wood and the red tulips. p. 20 VANBRUGH taking the flowersAh , tulips ! Who could be sad with tulips near ? Enright kindles the fire . Vanbrugh , still whistling , gently puts the flowers in the vase . He takes the candlesticks from the fireplace ; puts them close to the table ; lights one candle . Grant manages to light the second . The flames of the fire spring up . Vanbrugh turns out the electric lights . The table , with the navajo screen in back of it , looks as though it were set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bill Grant , let 's sit down . And , man , bring on the next course and another bottle . Enright goes out . Grant and Vanbrugh sit . The latter drains his glass . GRANT Is n't it cozy ? VANBRUGH More like . Excellent burgundy , Bill , excellent . Enright enters with the next course and a second bottle . Grant 's face beams ; he begins to eat . Vanbrugh continues . Enright goes out . VANBRUGH Do you remember the night of our freshman dinner ? Both laugh heartily . VANBRUGH Will you ever forget Tom Jordan , drunk as a lord , swearing that every one was his brother ? And ' member how he looked when he came to the Chinaman ? Again they laugh. p. 21 GRANT And Skee Williams doing a pas seul on the end of the table . I can see his green shirt to this day . They are in the best of humor . VANBRUGH And Dickie Leonard ,  --  that was the night we found out he could sing when pickled . Vanbrugh begins to sing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . They both rise . There 's nothing left of their singing voices , which break and flat frequently , but they manage to carry the song through to the end . The effect is pathos , not burlesque . When they finish both are breathless . They sit . Vanbrugh empties his glass . GRANT Oh dear , such good times . But so , so long ago . VANBRUGH It was only the beginning of my good times . GRANT Wo n't you tell me about yourself ? VANBRUGH You want to know how I live ? GRANT Please . VANBRUGH Well , perhaps you better . My life 's been so different from yours . I know how to live . Drains glass . When I got my degree , I went to work in a publishing house . For two years I led the life of a slave . Drudging , sweating , nothing but grind . I could n't even go out at night and enjoy myself : I 'd always be thinking of getting up to the grind in the morning . I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , I 'll know what to do . " Well , my luck came : the Old Man died and left me about five hundred a year . The day I got that bit of news the sun dawned for me . I hand't seen it for two years . I threw up my job on the spot . " No more work ; now I 'll live , " said I. And I meant it . God never intended us to work . If He had , why did He give us flowers and trees , and shady nooks and pattering streams ? He meant us to live ; and you ca n't really live and work . Fills his glass and drains it. p. 22 GRANT filled with amazement and interestBut what have you done ? VANBRUGH I have n't done a stroke of work since . I 've lived , I tell you . Oh , I 'm what the Ignorant would call a tramp . I walk about , and spend my days in the parks , where I can see the children playing , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth and blossom in all their loveliness . ConfidentiallyYou know , Bill , I sometimes compare myself to a flower . When I worked I was in the clay . Then I sprang forth into God 's world . GRANT Well , well ! But where do you live ? Where 's your home ? VANBRUGH My home is in the sunshine . GRANT But where do you sleep ? VANBRUGH Wherever it 's handy . GRANT I remember at college you never kept a room of your own . VANBRUGH What was the use of wasting money ? Everyone had an extra couch . I used to go the rounds . GRANT And now , in the winter ? VANBRUGH I go south . GRANT But you 're getting old . VANBRUGH In years , perhaps . p. 23 GRANT You do n't sleep out of doors this time of year , do you ? VANBRUGH Unless it turns cold . GRANT shaking his headI 'm afraid I could n't stand it . VANBRUGH Oh , yes you could . GRANT musingSleeping on park benches . His face lights upCourtleigh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and live with me . Vanbrugh only raises his head a trifle . GRANT Yes , yes , do . I 've lots of room . VANBRUGH Too much . GRANT eagerlyYou can go to the parks in the daytime . We 'll travel . We 'll go to Europe and South America ,  --  around the world if you wish . Vanbrugh is thinking . GRANT We 'll pass the last of our days together . You 'll have no worry about money , and I 'll always have some one to talk to . We 'll get another house if you do n't like this one ,  --  nearer the Park . VANBRUGH No , I could n't . GRANT You have n't a wife ? VANBRUGH No . There 's no use in a man marrying unless he wants some one to look after his house . I never did . p. 24 GRANT But you need a home . Oh come , just try staying here for a while . VANBRUGH No , thanks , old man . GRANT You can leave if you get tired of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VANBRUGH I could n't stand the restraint . GRANT There would n't be any . VANBRUGH Yes , there would . I 'd be tied down . Grant starts to speak . VANBRUGH Yes , I would . I 'd have to show up . I 'd lose my liberty . Mighty nice of you , Bill , but I prefer my own life . Drinks . GRANT keenly disappointedYou 'd have been such a comfort . VANBRUGH You wo n't try it with me ? GRANT What ? VANBRUGH Come along with me . GRANT Oh I  --  laughing very slightly and timidly I could n't . VANBRUGH Of course , you could . It 'd be a damn fine thing for you . GRANT But I  --  p. 25 VANBRUGH fascinatingly ; leaning over the tableWhy , you 'd love it ,  --  it 's just like that book Lavengro . All joy and sunshine . You 're never lonesome , because there are always people about to talk to . People who have lived and have a story to tell ,  --  stories like Arabian Nights . Sunshine and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and singing birds . GRANT I could n't leave my son . VANBRUGH Shucks ! Do n't you see that he 's left you ? GRANT Do n't say that . VANBRUGH Sorry , Bill , but it 's the truth . GRANT It was too quiet for him here . VANBRUGH And so it is for you . Come along . This is the beginning of summer . Make it the beginning of your summer . GRANT You think I could ? VANBRUGH Why , certainly . Of course you understand it wo n't be any gain to me . You 'll be more or less a drag on my hands . But I do n't want to be selfish . And I always like to help people . I 'll take you out and show you the real glories of this world ,  --  no worries , no cares , no loneliness . Why , if you do n't come with me you 'll just go on living here till you die . Grant shivers. p. 26 VANBRUGH My life 's the thing for you . It could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunsets and singing birds . Leaning way over the tableWill you come ? A brief pause . Then Grant speaks hurriedly , reaching desperately for the one way which will end his present situation . GRANT with something like terror in his voiceYes , Courtleigh , I 'll come . VANBRUGH leaning backThat 's the stuff . I was n't sure you had it in you . Holding up his glassTo the new life . They drink . Vanbrugh pulls out his Ingersoll . VANBRUGH It 's getting late . Time we were off . GRANT Sha' n't we wait until morning ? VANBRUGH I 'd have the nightmare if I slept in this house . GRANT I 'll do as you say . Rises , crosses to bell-rope and pulls it . VANBRUGH Better put some money in your sock . GRANT I always carry my check-book . VANBRUGH Cash 's better . Checks are difficult . Enright enters p. 27 GRANT excitedlyMy overcoat , Enright . ENRIGHT You 're going out , sir ? VANBRUGH the effect of the wine becoming even more evident , but Grant , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't wear his overcoat in the house , does he ? Enright goes into the hall . Grant moves to the fireplace ; looks up at his wife 's photograph as though she were giving her approval . Vanbrugh selects a tulip for his button-hole . VANBRUGH Always did fancy red . The colour of life blood . Enright enters with Grant 's coat and silk hat . VANBRUGH Not that hat , Bill . It 's too ladi-da . GRANT A derby , Enright , And pack a small bag . VANBRUGH Good Lord , no bag . Toothbrush . Too much to carry . ENRIGHT Shall I call a taxi , sir ? GRANT undecidedWhy  --  VANBRUGH We 're going to walk ! Enright starts ; puts coat and hat on chair , right upper ; hurriedly goes out right . Vanbrugh still sits , soporifically , at the table ; he fills his glass and drinks . Grant is too excited to be much surprised by Enright 's hurried exit before helping him with his coat ; he gets into it himself as Vanbrugh sings. p. 28 VANBRUGH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten thousand men , He led them up to the top of the hill , And he led them down again .

Enright watches him closely . VANBRUGH drunkI never could stand it to work . " No , no , " I said , " I never was meant for work . " Always hated work . Too damn much trouble . Laughs . Bill , I used to let the rooms where I was staying at college grow cold rather than mend the fire . Grant starts to take off his overcoat . Enright hurries to help him .

But come along . Get a move on . Golden sunsets and singing birds . Moves toward chair , left-lower . GRANT slowlyI think I wo n't go , Courtleigh . VANBRUGH stopsNot go ? Why not go ? GRANT No .

GRANT I mean it . Vanbrugh is silent. p. 30 GRANT Is there something now ? VANBRUGH Well  --  GRANT What is it ? VANBRUGH Got devilish thirsty one night . Met a bootlegger . Grant pulls out his wallet ; starts to take money from it . VANBRUGH If you do n't mind ,  --  ' course you understand I should n't have offered if you had n't asked ,  --  you might  --  Grant gives him several bills . VANBRUGH You 're too good . That 's trouble with you . Puts the money in his pocket . Damn prohibition !
