Calling all collectors : Vintage phones have found a new place in today 's high-tech homes . // ACCORDING TO THE STATISTICIANS AT AT &T,; Mother 's Day consistently ranks as the busiest W holiday of the year for residential longdistance phone use . Yet how many of us who call our mother this May 9 will pause to consider the technology that allows the human voice to travel across town or around the world ? The nuts and bolts-or , more accurately , the wires and circuits-of telephone technology fascinate telephone collectors . " Many collectors are curious about the scientific aspects of the telephone , " confirms dealer Rainbow Hirsh , of Hollywood Phones.com , a Boulder , Colo. , mail-order and Internet source for early-20th-century models . " Then many of them get hooked by the incredible range of designs that exists .

" Twenty years ago , everyone wanted a wall phone in their home , " says Richard Mountjoy , author of loo Years of Bell Telephones ( Schiffer ; 1995 ; $29.95 ) . As late-19th- and early-2oth-century models became more difficult to find , designs from succeeding decades began to make their way onto the tables at flea markets and antiques shows . Rainbow Hirsh reports that one of the most active areas in recent years has been Art Deco phones , along with other items from the era-furniture , kitchen collectibles , quilts , vintage posters , and the like . " The latest area of interest among telephone collectors involves models dating from the 195os and later , including Princess phones and Ericofons introduced late in the 195os , late1960s Sculptura phones , and novelty phones from the ' 6os and ' 70s , such as airplanes , footballs , hamburgers , lips , shoes , and pop culture icons like Mickey Mouse , Snoopy , Kermit the Frog , and Darth Vader , to name but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market , " Rainbow Hirsh observes . In response , these models are appearing more frequently in the marketplace , with most pieces falling within the $25 to - 125 range .

Antique phones produced by the Bell Telephone Co. and , later , by their design and manufacturing division , Western Electric , orafter Bell 's patent expired in 1894-by hundreds of competitors ( among them the Kellogg Switchboard and Supply Co. , the Stromberg-Carlson Telephone Manufacturing Co. , and the Automatic Electric Co. ) , are now eagerly sought at antiques shows , flea markets , and auctions across the country . During the early days of the telephone , the size of both the transmitter and the batteries needed to make each machine function dictated its size and form : sturdy , wooden units meant to be hung on the wall . Early wall models were built for Bell by small cabinet shops . Later these items were produced in larger numbers by manufacturers across the country . Among the rarest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " telephone , named for its resemblance to a casket . Made by the Boston firm of Charles Williams , Jr. , the wallmounted walnut coffin telephone featured two wooden , handheld pieces-a receiver to hold to the ear for listening and a transmitter for speaking . Today early coffin phones command anywhere from $5,000 to $15,000 depending on condition . More common wall models and those dating to the early decades of the 20th century generally fetch $200 to $500 . Candlestick Phones By 1900 , the internal elements of the telephone had been reduced in size and in the case of batteries , could be stored in a separate wooden box several feet away . As a result , standing desktop telephones eventually replaced bulkier wall units . These desk sets were commonly called " candlestick " phones , owing to their tall upright shaft topped by a mouthpiece ; a hooked arm supported the receiver . Candlestick phones often acquired nicknames related to the varying shapes of the shaft and base , such as the " pot belly " and the " oil can . " The most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ model popular in the 1920s . Candlesticks with unusual features-such as a c. 1905 Automatic Electric Co. model that featured a rotary dial with an nth finger hole that connected the user with a long-distance operatorare especially desirable . " Candlestick phones are fairly easy to find and start in the $150 to $300 range , " Richard Mountjoy says . Rare examples , Mr. Mountjoy continues , have sold for upwards of $10,000 . Cradle Phones Photograph Dealers tell us that there was a time when " serious " collectors limited their scope to pre-1900 telephones ; today 20th-century models are among the most desirable items in the field . Examples on this page include a black Bakelite phone from the 1940s ( above ) , a late-1950s red Ericofon made by the North Electric Co. , of Galison , Ohio ( above , right ) , and a 1960s novelty phone shaped like an airplane ( below ) . // Although one-piece handsets " cradled " on top of a phone had been in use late in the 1800s , the style did not become widely available until the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry Dreyfuss ( 19o4-1972 ) as a consultant to help revamp phone design . Dreyfuss rejected the circular phone base that had become the norm in favor of a rectangular base with sloping sides leading to a comfortable handset that could be cupped between the head and the shoulder . Edges and corners on Dreyfuss models were softened , materials were strengthened , and bodies were designed to be sleek , yet sturdy . Dreyfuss 's designs-including his highly collectible Model 2o2 of 1926 and Model 302 of 1937-came to represent the best in Art Deco style . " The span of 1925 to 1945 was a great period in American telephone design , " says Rainbow Hirsh . " These are the phones you see in old Hollywood movies and they have an aura of glamour about them .

Less-common pieces , such as those in colors other than black ( ivory , red , green , and blue , for instance ) can reach $1,000 . Sidebar But Can You Use It ? OLD TELEPHONES LOOK GREAT ON A wall , a desk , or a display shelf , but what if you want to use one of them ? According to Richard Marsh , owner of the Chicago Old Telephone Co. ( 327 Carthage St. , Sanford , NC 27330 ; 800843-1320 ) , just about any antique telephone can be made to work on today 's circuits . And he ought to know : He has been restoring and rewiring old telephones for more than 30 years . It is important , Marsh stresses , that restoration be done without damaging the integrity of the telephone or harming its value as an antique . In his experience , the most popular telephones for conversion to modern circuitry are the oak wall telephones from the first quarter of this century . Once these phones have been respectfully rewired , people can hold the original receiver up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at about $70 for rewiring a stand-up desk set and can run to about $300 for a complete overhaul of a wooden wall unit including cosmetic retouching . Customers generally cover shipping and handling costs . For do-it-yourselfers , the Old Chicago Telephone Co. also offers kits ranging in price from $29 to $69 depending on the phone in question that include all necessary materials and step-by-step instructions .

Sidebar Dreamer and Doer * Born in Scotland , Alexander Graham Bell ( shown here at the age of 63 ) was 29 and working in Boston when he received a U.S. patent for the telephone in 1876 . ( He became an American citizen in 1882. ) * Less-known contributions by Bell include the first practical phonograph , the hydrofoil , the metal detector , and the respirator. * During their 1877 honeymoon in Niagara Falls , Bell 's young wife , Mabel , got a taste of what life with an inventor could be like : She reported that while dining her husband would drop all of the sugar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Despite his eccentricities , they remained happily married for 45 years . * Bell preferred to answer the phone by calling out " Hoy ! Hoy ! " rather than saying the hello common today . * Bell was passionately involved in the creation of a " photophone " -a telephone that would carry sound via light waves-the year Mabel Bell gave birth to the couple 's second daughter , in 1880 . Bell suggested Photophone as the baby 's name ; fortunately , the family 's final choice was Daisy . * Bell was also a pioneer in speech education for the deaf and a strong proponent of lipreading , rather than sign language . Helen Keller was one of his students and a lifelong friend . * At the turn of the century , Bell served as the president of the National Geographic Society and helped transform its modest pamphlet into the world-renowned educational journal it is today . // <p>
