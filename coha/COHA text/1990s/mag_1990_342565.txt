Forget the 18 Prime Ministers , Wellingtons , Pitts and Walpoles : any school that is the ostensible alma mater of James Bond , Tarzan and Lord Peter Wimsey has clearly made a contribution to the world . And the quirkiness of Eton College ensures that it still seems to belong less to life than to Lewis Carroll fiction . The boys wear coats with tails , the teachers are called beaks , and both parties greet one another on the street by simply raising a single index finger . The prefects who sweep into classrooms , gowns billowing , to summon boys to see the headmaster are known as praepostors ( as in preposterous ) . And at Eton  --  and only at Eton  --  academic quarters are called halves , making three halves in a school year ( though the midpoint of each is " long leave , " since half-halves could be mistaken for quarters ) . <P> This year Gladstone 's " Queen of all the schools of all the world " is marking a significant anniversary : exactly 550 years have passed since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Windsor Castle to accommodate " 25 poor and indigent scholars . " And last week 's St. Andrew 's Day ( Nov. 30 ) , the final great red-letter day of the school 's anniversary year , was celebrated in typically Etonian style , with a staging of the annual Wall Game , a notorious blood sport in which 20 savage nobles flail and scramble in the mud in what is fittingly known as a " bully . " Punching is forbidden , but applying " steady pressure " with one 's fist upon a face is warmly encouraged . The poet Shelley was once used as a ball . No goal has been scored since before World War I. <P> Yet even as many of the school 's antics celebrate traditions older than Caxton 's printing press , Eton is , behind its ancient walls , steadily redressing itself for a more modern age . Perhaps the most hallowed tradition at Eton is a defiance of all expectations . And during the past 10 years , the school 's headmaster , Eric Anderson , and its provost , Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classic institution from within . Realizing , as Anderson stresses , that Eton must prepare its students for a more international world , it has opened its doors to more and more scholarship students and to boys from Germany , the Soviet Union and Spain . Latin is fading toward obsolescence , while Arabic , Japanese and Swahili are / all on the curriculum . In a sense , the place is drawing closer to its founder 's original notion of a truly " public " school . " It is a privileged school , " acknowledges Anderson , an energetic and articulate Scotsman from a family of royal kilt makers , " with beautiful buildings in a beautiful setting . But the only justification for privilege is that it should help people develop themselves to the full . We are elitist , but not exclusive . And I 'm not ashamed in the least of being elitist . All that means is aiming at the highest standards you can achieve . "                   @ @
