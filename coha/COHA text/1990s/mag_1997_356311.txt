When singer-songwriter Erykah Badu goes before an audience , she observes a ritual to clear away any preperformance anxiety . " I light my candle onstage , " says Badu . " I create my calm where I am . I close my eyes , open them again , and I 'm O.K. " Badu 's music is a lot like that . Her debut CD , Baduizm ( Kedar Entertainment/Universal ) , draws from soul , jazz , blues and hip-hop  --  but instead of a chaotic swirl of sound , the result is a slow-burning , serene trend in pop music . Along with other neo-soul performers like Maxwell , Groove Theory and Me'Shell NdegeOcello , she is creating music that expands the boundaries of conventional R. and B. , with lyrics that explore social issues ( as Marvin Gaye 's used to do ) , melodies that draw readily from jazz and blues , and wandering song structures that go beyond the standard verse-chorus-verse format . Hollywood has taken note . The sound track to the upcoming movie Love Jones ( starring Larenz Tate ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demonstrated huge commercial appeal . However , through canny marketing , Badu 's CD , due out Feb. 11 , has generated anticipatory buzz ; and her first single , On &; On , is already in the Top 40 . " I 'm a spiritual being , " says Badu . " But I 'm very much in touch with reality . I 'm in touch with the business side of music . I know what it takes to be successful . " <P> Badu , whose original name was Erykah Wright ( she gave herself the surname in homage to scat music ) , was born and raised in Dallas ( she now lives in Brooklyn , New York ) . She studied theater at Louisiana 's Grambling State University but , after deciding that " a degree is a piece of paper , " left to pursue a music career . Kedar Massenburg , a 32-year-old record-company executive , heard Badu 's demo tape and offered to sign her to his fledgling label , Kedar Entertainment . Says Badu : " I had several offers , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very smart , and he had a vision . None of the other labels had a vision . I was afraid I 'd get lost in the shuffle of a bigger label . " <P> Building buzz for an unknown singer on a little-known label is no easy task . Massenburg started by distributing 10,000 sampler cassettes featuring Badu to nearly everyone attending last year 's Soul Train Music Awards ; he also sent 2,500 vinyl copies of On &; On to radio stations and clubs . The producer continued his campaign by persuading D'Angelo , the critically lauded neo-soul singer he had once managed , to join Badu in a remake of the Marvin Gaye/Tammi Terrell duet Your Precious Love for the sound track of the movie High School High . Then , a few weeks ago , Massenburg booked Badu for a four-night stand at the Soul Cafe , a chic new Manhattan soul-food restaurant co-owned by Malik Yoba , star of Fox 's hip police drama , New York Undercover . Cool venue , hot singer . Word of mouth traveled fast ; by the second night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
