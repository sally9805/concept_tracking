Peter and Katherine ( Peter Weller and Judy Davis ) are bored and careless . They lose jobs , take on lovers , futz around with guru-driven spirituality and dress to the nines . You could argue , as writer-director Michael Tolkin doubtless did when he was pitching The New Age , that they are perfect exemplars of chic anomie as it manifests itself in postmodern  --  or postrational  --  Los Angeles . You could also argue , as people whose malls do n't yet contain an Issey Miyake boutique might , that they are hopeless twits . <P> It is possible that Tolkin , who in 1992 adapted his own novel , The Player , for the screen , harbored satirical hopes for this project . But as a director he lacks the antic eye that ( often enough to keep us interested ) rescues Robert Altman from depression and pretension . Tolkin just does n't know how to position himself  --  far enough from his characters to make fun of them , close enough to them to retain our sympathy . And the question of whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothing store they decide to open , is not a compelling one . Shopkeeping can not compare to moviemaking and murder ( The Player 's topics ) in dramatic interest . Peter and Katherine do n't even bicker entertainingly as their marriage collapses ; they just drawl withdrawal . The languid self-satisfaction of The New Age , the sense that its maker knows most people will hate it and does n't care because he 's issuing " a personal statement , " is its most annoying quality . Do n't be suckered . Your first instinct is right . It 's a terrible movie .
