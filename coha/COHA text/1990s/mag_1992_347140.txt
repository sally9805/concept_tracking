Bill Clinton was one day into a new offensive  --  accusing George Bush of planning to gut programs for the elderly , veterans and students  --  when a fresh disclosure about his draft status forced him to play defense again . The Los Angeles Times said that in 1968 his uncle Raymond Clinton managed to delay the new college graduate 's Army induction . <P> Now deceased , Raymond was a Hot Springs , Arkansas , businessman and a Republican with political connections . His lawyer , Henry Britt , also a Republican , served as a principal source for the Times piece . According to Britt and a surviving member of the local draft board , Raymond lobbied board members on his nephew 's behalf . He also secured a place in a Navy reserve unit , though Bill never applied for the opening . The story appears to explain why Clinton remained a civilian for 10 months , though classified 1-A . The following year he obtained a formal deferment by agreeing to join an ROTC program in which he never enrolled . Clinton ultimately avoided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went into effect . <P> While candid about his opposition to the Vietnam War , Clinton has also insisted he never received special treatment . So when the story broke Monday , he appeared momentarily rattled . Initially , he said " everyone involved " in the account is now dead , which is inaccurate . Then he alternately denied the import of the piece and maintained that he had already explained his behavior fully . Until Friday , his aides claimed Clinton was and is unaware of his uncle 's activities  --  whatever they might have been . But then came a report in the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette quoting a retired naval reserve officer , Trice Ellis Jr. , as saying he himself had told Clinton of Raymond 's efforts in March of this year . The candidate conceded that the report was true . <P> The latest challenge to Clinton 's credibility not only diverted attention from his aggressive campaign message but also gave the opposition a new opportunity to attack . " He is going to have to come clean , " huffed Dan Quayle , mauled himself in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
