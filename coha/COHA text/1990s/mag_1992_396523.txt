Among TV 's freshman class of ' ' 74 , Happy Days had to be Least Likely to Succeed : a post-Watergate sitcom set in Eisenhower-era Milwaukee ? Its savviest character a swaggering hiker in a black leather jacket ? " Aaaay , " said Arthur " Fonzie " Fonzarelli , in the role that made Henry Winkler an overnight star  --  and viewers responded with the Fonz 's trademark thumbs-up , making Happy Days the top-rated series in the 1976  --  77 season . As a retro pop-culture phenomenon , it helped define a decade . Its 1972 pilot had inspired George Lucas 's American Graffiti and its plot lines launched Laverne &; Shirley , Mork &; Mindy and Joanie Loves Chachi . By the time ABC pulled the plug in 1984 , " Sit on it ! " and other Fonzisms had become national catchphrases , and the Fonz 's jacket was deemed worthy of display in the Smithsonian , where it now hangs . ( Aaaay  --  talk about leaving skidmarks ! ) Since Happy Days celebrated nostalgia , it was only a matter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , amiably dopey Ralph Malph , musically mellow Warren " Potsie " Weber ( who all live on in syndicated reruns )  --  got together for one last song on the jukebox . For two memory-laced days , nine of the show 's stars assembled at a Burbank , Calif. , studio to tape a film-clip-and-savor class reunion that will air March 3 on ABC . During breaks , they fill each other in on how their lives and careers have fared since those happy TV Tuesdays when Elvis was young , U-2 was a plane , and Richie had to borrow his dad 's wheels . Richie 's folks , Howard and Marion Cunningham  --  actors Tom Bosley and Marion Ross  --  are schmoozing about old times at a table in the studio lunchroom . Suddenly Richie himself , Ron Howard , 38 , slides in next to Ross , who squeals and gives him a maternal hug . Then she notices the cap he 's wearing , emblazoned with the name of his production company , Imagine Films . " Look at him ! " she declares . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been sold on Howard as a director ever since the former child actor ( Opie on The Andy Griffith Show ) made a Splash in 1984 with his hit fantasy starring Daryl Hannah as a fish-out-of-water mermaid . He followed up with Cocoon , Willow and Backdraft , and this summer takes us Far and Away in a romantic epic starring young marrieds Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman . Ron 's steady has been Cheryl , his wife of 16 years . The couple live far from the Hollywood whirl  --  in Cos Cob , Conn. , with daughter Bryce , 11 , twins Jocelyn and Paige , 7 , and son Reed , 4 . Ron recalls his Happy Days days as " a pretty goddamn good time . " Of course , he adds , " It 's much easier to embrace your past when the past is n't a limitation . Being the kind of director I dreamed I 'd be , I do n't have to fret about whether or not people think of me as Richie or Opie . " Henry Winkler , 46 , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows that , to a generation of boomers , he 'll forever be the Fonz . " I 'm at peace with my past , with the character and with what I 'm doing , " Winkler says . What he has mostly been doing , following a short-lived movie acting career ( Night Shift , The One and Only ) , has been working behind the camera  --  as coexecutive producer of ABC 's MacGyver , which ends its seven-season run this spring . Now he 's directing Burt Reynolds in Cop and a Half for his pal Howard 's production company . " Ronnie 's the boss , " says Winkler . " Ronnie 's always the boss . " Their ties run deep : Henry and his wife , Stacey , married 14 years , are godparents to the Howards ' kids . And they have two of their own  --  Zoe , 11 , and Max , 8  --  with whom they live in North Hollywood . " I have an incredibly good life , " says Winkler , " the foundation of which is Happy Days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. and Mrs. C. Tom Bosley , 64 , went from delivering an exasperated " Rich-ard ! " to a querulous " Jessica ! " as Cabot Cove sheriff Amos Tupper , who had a flinty friendship with super-snoop Jessica Fletcher ( Angela Lansbury ) on Murder , She Wrote . Bosley then got to star in his own 1989 whodunit , Father Dowling Mysteries . His proposed new series , in which he 'd play the only man in a household of women , is now being shopped at the networks by Kimberly Beebe , a production executive who is also Bosley 's 27-year-old stepdaughter from his marriage to his second wife , Patricia . ( His first , Jean Eliot , died in 1978 . ) Bosley still chats occasionally with his TV ex , Marion Ross . But whenever fans approach Ross , 63 , to say how much they enjoyed her as Richie 's mom , it 's Jewish grandma Sophie Berger who stares back and replies : " Yes , but are you vatching da show now ? " Da show , of course , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ross 's career as hot as Sophie 's chicken soup . Her social life is n't bad either . Ross , who divorced actor Freeman " Effie " Meskimen more than 20 years ago , is currently dating Tevye the dairyman  --  actually , Paul Michael , 65 , who recently starred in a touring production of Fiddler on the Roof . ( Performing is a family tradition : The Meskimens ' son Jim , 32 , and daughter Ellen Plummer , 30 , are both actors . ) Marion also maintains ties to her Happy Days brood . Winkler is a close friend , and he showed up last year at the Christmas party Ross threw at her San Fernando Valley home , along with two costars she had n't seen in years : Anson Williams and Donny Most  --  the show 's Potsie and Ralph , respectively . Of all the returning alumni , Most , 38 , may have had the least luck shaking his TV persona . After Happy Days , he wound up in low-profile movie and TV roles , including the voice of an adventurer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though , Donny found a way out of the career dungeon by directing his first play , Doubles , in Los Angeles . On Valentine 's Day , he opened as a star of another L.A. play , Till Death or Whatever Do Us Part . Married for 10 years to Morgan Hart , a former actress , Donny lives with his wife and daughters , Madison , 5 , and Mackenzie , 3 , in Agoura Hills , an L.A. commuter town where , once or twice a month in the local supermarket , he will hear someone inquiring , " Say , were n't you ... ? " Williams , 42 , was able to parlay his singing talents as Potsie into a glitzy Vegas-style act . But by the mid ' ' 80s , he says , " I put the mike down and never picked it up again . It 's not what I was meant to do . " Ron Howard told him , " You should be directing , " and Williams went on to oversee episodes of L.A. Law and Hooperman . Recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feature film , All-American Murder , starring Christopher Walken . Split in 1986 from Lorrie Mahaffey ( who played Potsie 's sorority sweetheart Jennifer on Days ) , Williams lives in Malibu with his second wife , Jackie Gerken , a former vice president of production for Dine De Laurentiis . The couple 's only coproduction so far is daughter Hannah , 2 . Scott Baio , 30 , who played Fonzie 's studly cousin , Charles " Chachi " Arcola , is still single and active on the L.A. dating scene . When he shows up at the reunion taping , most of the snacks put out for the cast seem to have vanished and Scott is left with a bag of potato chips . " That 's the change in the business , " he grumbles . Baio should n't beef . Though his Joanie Loves Chachi spin-off lasted only a season ( 1982-83 ) , he went on to score as a college-age baby-sitter on Charles in Charge ( first on CBS , then in syndication ) and is currently playing an apartment superintendent on ABC 's Baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Scott talks about the one most conspicuously absent : his former TV bride Joanie , Erin Moran . " Do I miss her ? Yeah ! " he says sadly . " I hope she 's happy , but I do n't know what she 's doing . " Reached by phone at her Southern California spread , Moran , 31 , says she was invited to the Happy Days reunion but flatly declined . The actress who once played Richie 's perky kid sister now claims that every member of the cast is " evil , " adding , " I pray for them . " She also charges some relatives with being " bloodsuckers " who are after her money and accuses the government of conspiring to hook the country on crack and speed . Moran refutes tabloid reports that she herself was a drug addict and scoffs at rumors that she has " found God . " Says Erin : " I 've always had God . " For the past five years she has been married to Rocky Ferguson , a singer whose style she describes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a demo tape . As for future acting plans , Moran , who began her TV career at age 7 , says , " I want to do a movie about my life as a child star . " Meanwhile , a couple of seasoned character actors , Pat Morita and Al Molinaro , are embracing each other in the lunchroom upstairs from the taping . Morita , 59 , confides that " for a long while it felt like I would be the one ( cast member ) who would n't go anywhere . " Not content with playing Matsuo Takahashi , better known as Arnold , the original owner of the drive-in eatery where Richie , Fonzie and the gang hung out , Morita became an early Happy Days ' dropout , leaving in 1976  --  only to star in back-to-back sitcom flops . Mr. T and Tina and Blansky 's Beauties . Then , after a brief return to Happy Days in 1982 , Morita wound up with a beauty of a role : the wise martial-arts guru Mr. Miyagi in 1984 's The Karate Kid and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Yuki , with whom he has two daughters ( Aly , 21 , and Tia , 16 ) , Pat commutes between his L.A. home and Hawaii , where he has formed a home-video company . First release : a tape on shiatsu massage , due out this spring . Meanwhile , Morita has just finished work on Honeymoon in Vegas , with James Caan and Nicolas Cage , scheduled for this summer . Molinaro , 72 , who took over Arnold 's as avuncular Alfred Delvecchio , may be close to hanging up the apron . After costarring with Gregory Harrison in last season 's The Family Man , Molinaro , a onetime musician and TV producer , says , " I 've done acting for 20 years and now I 'm getting tired of it . " For the past couple of years , he has been developing sitcom ideas . On the front burner , Al and former costar Anson Williams are partners in Big Al 's , a chain of 14 restaurants in the Midwest , which they launched five years ago . Al and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suburb , and he has a son , Michael , 30 , from a previous marriage . But Molinaro still feels the pangs of separation from his " other " family  --  never more strongly than at the cast reunion , where he hugs everyone in sight . " We went through marriages , divorces , babies , deaths in the family , " Molinaro recalls . And it 's hard for him , he says , to think about all that now . " I 'm too emotional . It makes me crazy . In a week , though , " he adds sadly , " I 'll be terrible . " <p>
