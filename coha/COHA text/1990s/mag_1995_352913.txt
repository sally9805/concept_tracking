Fifty years after World War II , something like the blitzkrieg returned to Nijmegen last week . Dutch soldiers swarmed around the city as low-flying helicopters thundered overhead . The scenes reflected the kind of combat the Dutch know best : struggling with the elements as an onslaught of water threatened to submerge vast tracts of the Netherlands ' sub-sea-level terrain . <P> All across northwestern Europe an epic deluge was sloshing over the banks of rivers such as the Rhine , the Waal and the Meuse . Torrential rains had combined with prematurely melting Alpine snows to overload major waterways funneling into the Low Countries . The flooding provoked the largest evacuation ever mobilized in the Netherlands : 250,000 people were forced to flee their homes in Limburg and Gelderland , two placid southern provinces of willows and windmills , where dikes were threatening to burst at critically weak points . Almost all the embankments were holding as last week ended , but a red alert persisted . <P> Upriver in Germany , the Rhine rose to 35 feet at Cologne , equaling the century 's record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the Rhine , Main , Mosel and Nahe were engulfed by the rampaging rivers . The most extensive overflows hit France , where floods covered almost all of the country 's northern half . <P> Everywhere , critics blamed human error . Builders have transformed large tracts of France 's countryside into shopping malls , parking lots and highways , which has doubled or even tripled the volume of unabsorbed water . Farmers eager to make their work more efficient have ripped out hedgerows , so what used to be patchworks of fields plowed at right angles are now consolidated under parallel plowing that drains in one direction . Straightening the bends of the upper Rhine for shipping ease has shortened the entire course by 50 miles , doubling the speed of Alpine runoffs . <P> If those culprits were not enough , the Dutch had some of their own . Plans for shoring up the dikes with concrete blocks have languished for years under a policy-review system that requires lengthy consultations . To many evacuees , preserving the beauty of their landscape was less important than preserving terra firma. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
