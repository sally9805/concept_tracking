Ella Enchanted That fool of a fairy Lucinda did not intend to lay a curse on me . She meant to bestow a gift . When I cried inconsolably through my first hour of life , my tears were her inspiration . Shaking her head sympathetically at Mother , the fairy touched my nose . " My gift is obedience . Ella will always be obedient . Now stop crying , child . " Father was away on a trading expedition as usual , but our cook , Mandy , was there . She and Mother were horrified , but no matter how they explained it to Lucinda , they could n't make her understand the terrible thing she 'd done to me . I could picture the argument : Mandy 's freckles standing out sharper than usual , her frizzy gray hair in disarray , and her double chin shaking with anger ; Mother still and intense , her brown curls damp from labor , the laughter gone from her eyes . I could n't imagine Lucinda . I did n't know what she looked like . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it came on my fifth birthday . I seem to remember that day perfectly , perhaps because Mandy told the tale so often . " For your birthday , " she 'd start , " I baked a beautiful cake . Six layers . " Bertha , our head maid , had sewn a special gown for me . " Blue as midnight with a white sash . You were small for your age even then , and you looked like a china doll , with a white ribbon in your black hair and your cheeksred from excitement . " In the middle of the table was a vase filled with flowers that Nathan , our manservant , had picked . We all sat around the table . ( Father was away again . ) I was thrilled . I had watched Mandy bake the cake and Bertha sew the gown and Nathan pick the flowers . Mandy cut the cake . When she handed me my piece , she said without thinking , " Eat . " The first bite was delicious . I finished the slice happily . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one was harder . When it was gone , no one gave me more , but I knew I had to keep eating . I moved my fork into the cake itself . " Ella , what are you doing ? " Mother said . " Little piggy . " Mandy laughed . " It 's her birthday , Lady . Let her have as much as she wants . " She put another slice on my plate . I felt sick , and frightened . Why could n't I stop eating ? Swallowing was a struggle . Each bite weighed on my tongue and felt like a sticky mass of glue as I fought to get it down . I started crying while I ate . Mother realized first . " Stop eating , Ella , " she commanded . I stopped . Anyone could control me with an order . It had to be a direct command , such as " Put on a shawl , " or " You must go to bed now . " A wish or a request had no effect . I was free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shawl , " or " Why do n't you go to bed now ? " But against an order I was powerless . If someone told me to hop on one foot for a day and a half , I 'd have to do it . And hopping on one foot was n't the worst order I could be given . If you commanded me to cut off my own head , I 'd have to do it . I was in danger at every moment . As I grew older , I learned to delay my obedience , but each moment cost me dear-in breathlessness , nausea , dizziness , and other complaints . I could never hold out for long . Even a few minutes were a desperate struggle . I had a fairy godmother , and Mother asked her to take the curse away . But my fairy godmother said Lucinda was the only one who could remove it . However , she also said it might be broken someday without Lucinda 's help . But I did n't know how . I did n't even know who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lucinda 's curse made a rebel of me . Or perhaps I was that way naturally . Mother rarely insisted I do anything . Father knew nothing of the curse and saw me too infrequently to issue many commands . But Mandy was bossy , giving orders almost as often as she drew breath . Kind orders or for-your-own-good orders . " Bundle up , Ella . " Or " Hold this bowl while I beat the eggs , sweet . " I disliked these commands , harmless as they were . I 'd hold the bowl , but move my feet so she would have to follow me around the kitchen . She 'd call me minx and try to hem me in with more specific instructions , which I would find new ways to evade . Often , it was a long business to get anything done between us , with Mother laughing and egging each of us on by turn . We 'd end happily-with me finally choosing to do what Mandy wanted , or with Mandy changing her order to a request . When Mandy would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean , I 'd say , " Do I have to ? " And she 'd reconsider . When I was eight , I had a friend , Pamela , the daughter of one of the servants . One day she and I were in the kitchen , watching Mandy make marchpane . When Mandy sent me to the pantry for more almonds , I returned with only two . She ordered me back with more exact instructions , which I followed exactly , while still managing to frustrate her true wishes . Later , when Pamela and I retreated to the garden to devour the candy , she asked why I had n't done what Mandy wanted straight off . " I hate when she 's bossy , " I answered . Pamela said smugly , " I always obey my elders . " " That 's because you do n't have to . " " I do have to , or Father will slap me . " " It 's not the same as for me . I 'm under a spell . " I enjoyed the importance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only fairy rash enough to cast them on people . " Like Sleeping Beauty ? " " Except I wo n't have to sleep for a hundred years . " " What 's your spell ? " I told her . " If anybody gives you an order , you have to obey ? Including me ? " I nodded . " Can I try it ? " " No . " I had n't anticipated this . I changed the subject . " I 'll race you to the gate . " " All right , but I command you to lose the race . " " Then I do n't want to race . " " I command you to race , and I command you to lose . " We raced . I lost . We picked berries . I had to give Pamela the sweetest , ripest ones . We played princesses and ogres . I had to be the ogre . An hour after my admission , I punched her . She screamed , and blood poured from her nose . Our friendship ended that day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from our town of Frell . After punishing me for using my fist , Mother issued one of her infrequent commands : never to tell anyone about my curse . But I would n't have anyway . I had learned caution . When I was almost fifteen , Mother and I caught cold . Mandy dosed us with her curing soup , made with carrots , leeks , celery , and hair from a unicorn 's tail . It was delicious , but we both hated to see those long yellow-white hairs floating around the vegetables . Since Father was away from Frell , we drank the soup sitting up in Mother 's bed . If he had been home , I would n't have been in her room at all . He did n't like me to be anywhere near him , getting underfoot , as he said . I sipped my soup with the hairs in it because Mandy had said to , even though I grimaced at the soup and at Mandy 's retreating back . " I 'll wait for mine to cool , " Mother said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hairs out while she ate and put them back in the empty bowl when she was done . The next day I was well and Mother was much worse , too sick to drink or eat anything . She said there was a knife in her throat and a battering ram at her head . To make her feel better , I put cool cloths on her forehead and told her stories . They were only old , familiar tales about the fairies that I changed here and there , but sometimes I made Mother laugh . Except the laugh would turn into a cough . Before Mandy sent me off for the night , Mother kissed me . " Good night . I love you , precious . " They were her last words to me . As I left the room , I heard her last words to Mandy . " I 'm not very sick . Do n't send for Sir Peter . " Sir Peter was Father . The next morning , she was awake , but dreaming . With wide-open eyes , she chattered to invisible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mandy and me , there in the room with her , she said nothing . Nathan , the manservant , got the physician , who hurried me away from Mother 's side . Our hallway was empty . I followed it to the spiral staircase and walked down , remembering the times Mother and I had slid down the banister . We did n't do it when people were around . " We have to be dignified , " she would whisper then , stepping down the stairs in an especially stately way . And I would follow , mimicking her and fighting my natural clumsiness , pleased to be part of her game . But when we were alone , we preferred to slide and yell all the way down . And run back up for another ride , and a third , and a fourth . When I got to the bottom of the stairs , I pulled our heavy front door open and slipped out into bright sunshine . It was a long walk to the old castle , but I wanted to make a wish , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have the best chance of being granted . The castle had been abandoned when King Jerrold was a boy , although it was reopened on special occasions , for private balls , weddings , and the like . Even so , Bertha said it was haunted , and Nathan said it was infested with mice . Its gardens were overgrown , but Bertha swore the candle trees had power . I went straight to the candle grove . The candles were small trees that had been pruned and tied to wires to make them grow in the shape of candelabra . For wishes you need trading material . I closed my eyes and thought . " If Mother gets well quick , I 'll be good , not just obedient . I 'll try harder not to be clumsy and I wo n't tease Mandy so much . " I did n't bargain for Mother 's life , because I did n't believe she was in danger of dying .
