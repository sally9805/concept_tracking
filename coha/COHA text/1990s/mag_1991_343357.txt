Something had to replace the threat of communism , and at last a workable substitute is at hand . " Multiculturalism , " as the new menace is known , has been denounced in the media recently as the new McCarthyism , the new fundamentalism , even the new totalitarianism  --  take your choice . According to its critics , who include a flock of tenured conservative scholars , multiculturalism aims to toss out what it sees as the Eurocentric bias in education and replace Plato with Ntozake Shange and traditional math with the Yoruba number system . And that 's just the beginning . The Jacobins of the multiculturalist movement , who are described derisively as P.C. , or politically correct , are said to have launched a campus reign of terror against those who slip and innocently say " freshman " instead of " freshperson , " " Indian " instead of " Native American " or , may the Goddess forgive them , " disabled " instead of " differently abled . " <P> So you can see what is at stake here : freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great many professorial egos . But before we get carried away by the mounting backlash against multiculturalism , we ought to reflect for a moment on the system that the P.C. people aim to replace . I know all about it ; in fact it 's just about all I do know , since I  --  along with so many educated white people of my generation  --  was a victim of monoculturalism . <P> American history , as it was taught to us , began with Columbus ' " discovery " of an apparently unnamed , unpeopled America , and moved on to the Pilgrims serving pumpkin pie to a handful of grateful red-skinned folks . College expanded our horizons with courses called Humanities or sometimes Civ , which introduced us to a line of thought that started with Homer , worked its way through Rabelais and reached a poignant climax in the pensees of Matthew Arnold . Graduate students wrote dissertations on what long-dead men had thought of Chaucer 's verse or Shakespeare 's dramas ; foreign languages meant French or German . If there had been high technology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anywhere , at any time , doing anything worth noticing , we did not know it , nor did anyone think to tell us . <P> Our families and neighborhoods reinforced the dogma of monoculturalism . In our heads , most of us ' 50s teenagers carried around a social map that was about as useful as the chart that guided Columbus to the " Indies . " There were " Negroes , " " whites " and " Orientals , " the latter meaning Chinese and " Japs . " Of religions , only three were known  --  Protestant , Catholic and Jewish  --  and not much was known about the last two types . The only remaining human categories were husbands and wives , and that was all the diversity the monocultural world could handle . Gays , lesbians , Buddhists , Muslims , Malaysians , Mormons , etc. were simply off the map .
