SNUFFLES WAS A GOOD DOG . <p> Not a very smart dog . In fact , just smart enough to know that he did n't know the half of what the masters were up to . But when Boss said " Good dog , " he wagged his tail and thought , " Yes , I am a pretty good dog . " <p> Which is why the creatures digging in the back yard bothered him so much . All night , he could hear them scratching in the garden , and during the day he could smell their rotten scent all through the yard . One night when Boss did n't bring him inside at the regular time , he saw one peek its gnarled , horny head from one of the holes . Its lips curled into a mossy leer . <p> Snuffles shot toward the front yard , yelping and trailing a string of pee like a naughty puppy . When Boss heard his barks , he called Snuffles inside , and the dog obeyed , still shaking with fright . <p> Every night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boss did n't seem to understand . <p> " Shut up ! " he said , putting down his newspaper in disgust . " You 'll wake the baby . " <p> " But Boss , " Snuffles moaned . " Boss , Boss ... in the yard , Boss . Go look . Go look . " <p> He looked to Bitch-With-Pup for understanding , but she just looked disgusted and turned back to feeding the Pup its bottle . <p> Boss said , " Stop whining , or you 're sleeping outside . " <p> That much Snuffles understood , and he certainly did not want to sleep outside , near the creatures and the work they did at night , so he went into the bedroom and lay down on his pillow , head on paws . Outside , the maddening sound of the creatures digging continued unabated . <p> The next day , Snuffles followed Boss out to work in the garden . Boss filled the wheelbarrow with compost and started to shovel it onto the carrot patch . <p> " What 's this ? " Boss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frown . Snuffles wagged his tail anxiously . <p> " Looks like those damn gophers came back . " <p> Not Those-Damn-Gophers . Snuffles liked Those-Damn-Gophers . They were fun to chase . He could n't smell them anywhere . He could n't even smell You-Mangy-Cat . The creatures must have eaten him , too . <p> Boss went to the shed and brought back the box with the bad , don'teat pellets . He poured some in the first few holes , then shook the box and grunted . <p> " I 'll tell you what , Snuffles , " Boss said . " I 'll run down to Stanley Seed and get some more gopher bait . You keep an eye on things until I get back . " <p> He pointed to the holes . <p> Snuffles let out an inadvertent moan , " No , please . " His tail crept unhappily between his legs . <p> " That 's right . Good dog . " <p> Snuffles took his guarding duties quite seriously . When You-MangyCat came slinking into the yard to spray its scent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolled-up paper against the door , Snuffles roared in from the back yard to chase the boy away before he disturbed Boss . But today Snuffles was scared . <p> Boss 's car crunched its way out of the driveway . The dog hunkered down to wait about ten feet from one of the holes . <p> " Snuffles , " a low voice said from the hole . " Snuffles , are you hungry ? " <p> Snuffles cocked his head and looked at the hole . He let out a low growl . <p> One of the creatures popped its head from the hole . Snuffles growled again . He wanted to run inside and hide behind the couch , but Boss had told him to wait . <p> Another creature looked out from a second hole . " Are you hungry Snuffles ? " More creatures appeared . <p> They were all munching on something . After every bite they licked their chops and belched as if it were the most delicious meal they 'd ever eaten . The first creature , who looked bigger and mossier than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held out a hand for Snuffles to see . <p> Steak ! Partially cooked and fatty like the tidbits Boss or Bitch-WithPup fed him from the stove . Only these were big pieces . The rich , meaty smell filled the air , overpowering the creatures ' sickly odor . He took two steps forward . <p> " That 's right , Snuffles , " the big , mossy one said . " Yummy , yum , yum , yum . " It licked its lips with a narrow , darting tongue . <p> The creatures did n't look so threatening , Snuffles realized . No , they looked downright friendly with those wide smiles . He must have judged them wrong , that 's all . He wagged his tail and took another step forward . <p> " Good boy . See , we 're your friends . What a good dog . " It dangled the steak in front of Snuffles ' nose . <p> Snuffles ' mouth felt wet and slobbery . He swallowed his saliva , licked his chops and leaned toward the meat . He would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawn and eat it . He opened his mouth . <p> The creature leaned forward slightly , an eager look on its face , and the dog hesitated . Underneath the rich steak smell , he could smell something nasty . <p> He jumped back with a yelp . They were n't eating steaks at all , he could see , but were munching on the bad , don't-eat pellets Boss had poured in the hole . Poison . <p> The first time Snuffles had smelled the pellets , he 'd dug down into one of Those-Damn-Gophers ' holes after them . A few minutes later , he felt weak and sick all over . He threw up behind the pee-tree , then lay down on the porch panting . Boss had found him and rushed him to the nasty place where they stuck you with needles and stuck things up your butt . <p> " Get out of here ! " Snuffles shouted . " I 'll kill you ! I 'll rip your arms out ! " <p> The creatures opened their mouths and made a sound like banging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're a dead dog , " the big one said . The leader . <p> " We 're taking over . " <p> " A coup . " <p> " We 'll kill the man and his woman . " <p> " Rip down his house . " <p> " Take the baby . " <p> " You 'd better not sleep tonight . " <p> Snuffles whined and crept further back . He did n't understand , but he knew that the creatures were Very Bad . <p> The creatures popped back into their holes . Shortly , the digging sounds resumed . He could feel them under his feet . They were everywhere in the yard . <p> Snuffles shouted over and over , until the others in the neighborhood joined in a chorus of barks and howls , and the masters came out of their houses and hollered for the dogs to shut up . <p> THAT NIGHT SNUFFLES slept between the two bedrooms . He jolted awake at every sound and growled . <p> " Quiet , Snuffles , " Bitch-With-Pup said from the darkness . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crawling out of bed to send him outside . <p> Eventually , Snuffles fell asleep and dreamed . <p> " Snuffles . Snuffles . " <p> Busy chasing a rabbit across a field , the dog paused when he heard his name called . He saw Boss waving the frisbee on the other side of the field . <p> " Snuffles . Wake up Snuffles , " Boss said . But his voice sounded funny . It sounded like one of the creatures . <p> Snuffles awoke with a start . <p> " Snuffles . Are you awake ? " <p> He cocked his head . A bit of moonlight shone through the kitchen window and onto the carpeted threshold between the two bedrooms where Snuffles lay . He could n't see where the voice came from , but it sounded close . <p> " Over here , Snuffles . " <p> He climbed to his feet and looked down the heating vent . The voice seemed to come from down there . He whined . Maybe it was Boss , playing a joke . Yeah , a trick . Boss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Snuffles . We came like we promised . " <p> No . It was n't a trick . <p> Snuffles turned and looked toward the bedroom . The Pup slept quietly in its crib . He turned back to the hole and growled . <p> The creatures went quiet . <p> In the masters ' bedroom , the snoring stopped . He could hear Boss shift a little in his bed . The snoring started again . <p> " Stop growling , " Bitch-With-Pup warned from the darkened bedroom . " Go to sleep . " <p> He turned back to the vent . It was quiet . <p> A few minutes passed . <p> A sudden movement caught his eye . The leader of the creatures stood on the counter next to the sink , behind the glasses Bitch-With-Pup had lined up on a towel to dry . It beckoned for Snuffles to come closer . <p> Carefully , Snuffles climbed to his feet and made his way across the kitchen floor . He did n't want to bark and wake up the masters until he was sure the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be proof . <p> " Snuffles , " the creature whispered . " I bet you really want to bite me , do n't you ? " <p> A low growl came to the dog 's lips . He suppressed it . <p> The creature had made a mistake , Snuffles could see . It stood too far onto the towel , the edge of which dangled over the counter . One tug on the edge , and the creature would come spilling to the ground , Snuffles would grab it , and Boss would see . <p> He stepped forward , tilting his head curiously . With a snarl , he leapt forward , grasping the towel in his teeth and jerking backwards with his head . <p> The creature moved impossibly fast . It leapt nimbly to one side , then with a second leap , jumped to the stove , where it slid between the stove and the wall . As it did , it laughed . <p> Too late , Snuffles tried to stop his pull . The glasses poised on the edge of the counter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one after another . They rained down on him in a series of crashes . <p> In an instant , the light came on and Boss stood glaring at him . Boss stared at the glass on the floor with a terrible look on his face . <p> It was n't him . Could n't Boss see ? <p> Boss marched into the front room , opened the door and pointed . " Out . " <p> Snuffles slinked toward Boss , tail unhappily between his legs . He hesitated . Boss grabbed him by the collar and started to drag him outside . <p> Snuffles glanced over his shoulder and saw creatures boiling from the vent in the kitchen like a swarm of oversized rats . Some had horns , others arms that hung to their feet , long claws on the end of their hands . Their eyes glowed red in the dark , and they made their way toward the bedroom in a quiet line . The big one turned to Snuffles and sneered . <p> Snuffles struggled against the hand on his collar . He growled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What are you barking at ? " Boss asked in his disgusted voice . He did n't turn around to look . " Do you hear rocks rattling in your head ? " <p> And suddenly Snuffles realized . Boss was wrong . He had made a mistake . The thought stunned him for a moment , and he did n't know what to do . <p> He turned and snapped at Boss . His teeth clamped down on the fleshy part of the man 's hand . With a cry of pain Boss released the collar and jumped backwards . <p> Snuffles ran through the front room , then scrambled over the slick kitchen floor and into the Pup 's bedroom . Behind him , Boss yelled and cursed . <p> The creatures were scaling the side of the crib . Long hands reached through the slats and grabbed at the Pup . One of them jumped inside . It pulled back the blanket and wrapped its claw around the sleeping Pup 's ankle . <p> " Get away ! " he shouted . <p> He ran into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grabbed one by the arm and threw it from the crib . Its skin felt tough and chewy like the bicycle tire he 'd found in the shed , only it burned his mouth . <p> They scratched him with sharp claws , and bit him on the flanks . He yelped his pain , and turned his jaws to snap back . They were all over him , too many . He dragged one from the side of the crib and bent down to tear its throat out . <p> The light flicked on . The creatures disappeared down the vent in the Pup 's room . The grate slipped quietly into place behind them . Too fast . Boss stood in the threshold . <p> " What the hell are you doing ? . " Boss yelled , blinking against the light . He rubbed his hand where the dog had bitten it . <p> Snuffles crouched on the floor . He looked around for the creatures ; they were nowhere to be seen . The Pup started to cry in its crib . <p> " That does it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the collar . " Now you 're sleeping in the shed . " <p> Wrapping herself in a bathrobe , Bitch-With-Pup came in . Snuffles whined at her , hoping she would understand . She picked up the Pup and clutched it against her chest . <p> " What is wrong with him ? " she asked Boss . <p> Boss shrugged . " I do n't know . He broke the glasses , he woke the baby . He bit me . " <p> " No , " Snuffles whined . " No , not hurt . Good dog . " <p> " Oh , Snuffles , " she said . " What is wrong with you ? First the glasses , and now this ? " <p> They had an awful look on their faces . It was the look of betrayed trust . The same look they 'd given him last winter when he 'd chewed up Boss 's leather glove , only a hundred times worse . Snuffles felt sick and weak all over . <p> Boss dragged him out to the shed . <p> " Bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you understand ? Now you have to sleep in the shed . " <p> The door banged shut behind him and Snuffles could hear the latch draw shut . <p> His skin burned . He could feel where the creatures had bitten and clawed him . But when he leaned over to lick the wound , his skin was whole . He wanted to lie down and sleep , and forget the sound of mistrust in Boss 's voice . <p> How had he been so stupid ? They had tricked him into getting thrown out . He 'd thought they wanted to break a few things , and really they wanted to steal the Pup . <p> He had to save it . <p> Something tapped against the window above Boss 's worktable . Snuffles looked up to see red eyes staring back at him . It was the leader with the long horns and the mossy face . <p> " Ha ! Ha ! Snuffles , " it said through the glass . " You 've lost . " <p> He growled . <p> " Oh , what are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bark at me ? I 'm scared , Snuffles . Terrified . " <p> The creature disappeared . <p> He ran over to stand against the table and press his nose against the glass . Row after row of red eyes crawled into the holes in the garden ; underneath were the tunnels that crept up under the house . <p> There were two ways to get out of the shed , Snuffles had discovered . The first was the door - latched firmly shut when Boss left . The second was the window ; if Boss left it open , he could leap onto the table and squeeze through . But it was closed . <p> They were coming . Any minute they would squeeze through the vent and grab the Pup . They would swarm over the bed and kill the masters . <p> Snuffles trotted to the far side of the shed . He eyed the window for a moment , then broke into a run . He leapt onto the table and smashed into the window . <p> Crack ! His head smacked painfully against the glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break outward like he 'd hoped . <p> He jumped down from the table , snorting and shaking his head . A ringing sound filled his ears . <p> He ran to the other side of the shed and charged the window again . This time it broke apart , shards of glass tinkling to the ground below . The hole was big enough for his head , and widened as he squeezed his body through . Razor sharp fingers sliced his skin in a dozen places along his back . <p> He fell to the ground and jumped to his feet . <p> The nasty smell filled the yard . He could hear them under his feet , crawling through their tunnels . He heard a sound like the Pup crying . <p> Growling angrily , he sniffed on the ground . Just under his feet , he could hear sounds : the creatures scrabbling under the ground , the Pup whimpering . This was the main tunnel . <p> He dug furiously into the grass . In an instant , he had burst into their tunnel . The creatures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They tried to pull the Pup through , but the tunnel had collapsed enough that the Pup would n't fit . <p> Snuffles grabbed the Pup by its sleeper and pulled it onto the grass . The creatures screamed and pulled on the Pup 's feet . The Pup had a glazed look in its eyes . It whimpered a little , but did n't cry . Something was wrong with it . <p> " Snuffles ! " Boss shouted . <p> He stood off the back porch , looking at the dog . He wore his bathrobe and slippers and had an angry look on his face . <p> " What are you doing ? " <p> The Pup whimpered again . It lay on the ground at Snuffles 's feet , its face cut and scratched . <p> Boss shouted angrily and came toward Snuffles with his hand outstretched . <p> " No , Boss . No . Not hurt Pup . Look ! " <p> Boss saw the ring of red eyes standing just out of Snuffles 's reach , the eyes looking up from the hole . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He stood , shaking . " Snuffles , what is it ? " <p> The big creature with the horns said , " Go back to bed . " <p> " Who are you ? " Boss said . " What do you want ? " His voice sounded afraid . <p> The big creature said , " The baby . Give us the baby . " <p> " The baby ? " Boss asked . His voice sounded funny , like something was stuffed in his mouth . <p> " No , " Snuffles said . " Not hurt the Pup . " He stood protectively over the Pup , who was strangely quiet , much like Boss . He did n't know if this was a test , or if there was something wrong with Boss . <p> " You stay out of this , dog , " one of the creatures snarled . They turned back to Boss . " Give us the baby , and we 'll leave you alone . " <p> Boss stood stiffly . Something was wrong . He was quiet for a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the head . " Take the baby . " <p> The creatures surged forward , hissing and clacking their teeth . <p> " No ! " Snuffles shouted . " I 'll kill you all . " <p> The creatures attacked . <p> Snuffles seized the first in his jaws and shook it back and forth . It screamed and clawed at his eyes . He tossed it back into the pack . <p> Boss stood , unmoving . <p> " Wake up ! " Snuffles shouted . He bit Boss on the leg , hard . The man shouted . <p> But it seemed to jolt him from his stupor . He shouted and kicked at the creatures . <p> " Rick , " Bitch-With-Pup cried from behind them . " What is happening ? " <p> " Get in the car ! " he screamed at Bitch-With-Pup . " Take the baby and lock the doors . And do n't look out the windows . Do n't look at them . " <p> " What ? " she asked . " What are you talking about ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the creatures , snatched up the Pup and ran toward the car . It was parked in the driveway about thirty feet away around the side of the house . Snuffles heard the door slam shut . The creatures screamed and gnashed their teeth . <p> There were too many of them , and they were too strong . <p> Boss fought ferociously - that 's why he was Boss , after all- but the creatures kept coming . <p> The big one laughed . He stood on the patio , watching . <p> He was the one who had to be stopped , Snuffles realized . None of the others mattered . <p> The dog broke through the creatures surrounding him . One latched onto his leg , but he threw it aside . Snuffles reached the patio . <p> " Come on , " the big one shouted . " Come on . I 'll kill you . I 'll tear you apart . " It ran at Snuffles , clawed hands outstretched . <p> Snarling , the dog leapt to meet the creature . He grabbed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it tore at his muzzle . <p> " No , " Snuffles growled between shakes of his head . " I 'll kill you . " <p> It struggled and screamed . The creature hooked one of its horns along the dog 's face , narrowly avoiding his eye , but Snuffles knew if he let go , the creature would slip away into the night and he would n't get another chance . <p> Blood splattered on his muzzle , and he did n't know if it was his or the creature 's , but he did n't stop biting and shaking until the creature hung limply in his mouth . <p> The yard became suddenly quiet . Boss stood gasping , and the rest of the creatures stood back a pace , their eyes on the dog and their dead leader . <p> Snuffles growled . <p> Suddenly , the creatures turned and fled to their holes , disappearing as quickly as they 'd come . A few stayed behind , dead or wounded . <p> Boss got his axe from the shed . He chopped at the dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blade . Snuffles sniffed out one that hid in the long grass by the shed , and caught another trying to crawl back to its hole . He tore it in half . His mouth burned . <p> The sun crept into the sky , and as it did , the bodies shriveled like worms on hot asphalt . Boss stood and looked over the yard . He wiped his bathrobe against his face , then his hands on the grass . <p> Boss said , " We 'll pour gas down the holes and burn the little bastards out " <p> So that 's what the creatures were . The-Little-Bastards . <p> " Yeah , Boss . Yeah . " <p> " And if that does n't work , we 'll shove the hose down there and drown them . And if they 're still there , we 'll bring a backhoe in here and root them out . " <p> Scratches covered Boss 's legs , but he did n't seem to notice . He looked down at the dog . Snuffles cringed a little , sure that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and severe now that The-LittleBastards had been defeated . But instead Boss bent and scratched Snuffles 's ears with both hands , carefully avoiding the dog 's wounds . <p> " You are a good dog . I 'm sorry I doubted you . " He looked over the dog 's body . " Poor boy , you 're hurt , are n't you ? " <p> Snuffles 's heart leapt with joy . He would n't be punished . His tail wagged furiously . <p> Bitch-With-Pup got out of the car , the Pup sleeping in her arms . <p> She said , " What a good dog . I think he deserves a reward , do n't you Rick ? " <p> " Sure , " Boss said . " A big reward . " <p> " What do you want Snuffles ? A nice juicy steak ? How about we go camping next weekend , if you 're healed up enough by then ? " <p> Boss scratched his head again . " She 's right , boy . Anything you want . What will it be ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oh boy . I want to sleep on the bed . " <p> The masters looked at him . <p> Bitch-With-Pup said , " I think he tried to say something . " " What was that , Snuffles ? " Boss asked . <p> Snuffles panted . " I want to sleep on the bed . Every night . On the bed . On the bed ! " <p> But of course the masters did n't understand . They never did . <p> Author Affiliation
