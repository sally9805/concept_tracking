<p> When Chung and his wife left their daughter 's home in the East Bay last year , the elderly Chinese immigrants ended up walking the streets in a helpless state for hours , in tears and with nowhere to go . Although they felt unwelcome , they reluctantly returned the same day . <p> Several months later , it was a different story : The couple found a basement apartment in San Francisco 's Chinatown , abandoning the creature comforts of the suburbs for a life of independence in the city . <p> Chung and his wife are among a growing number of elderly immigrants from Asia , where extended families generally stick together no matter what , who have left the homes of their adult children to live on their own . <p> Such changing family values in the Asian American community debunk the notion that elderly Asian immigrants are unable  --  and unwilling  --  to break with tradition to adjust to life in the United States . <p> " Many of them are immigrants with a strong sense of resilience , " said Forrest Gok @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They may have been poor in the old country . They may have gone through a lot of sacrifices to bring their families here . They believe in sacrifice . If their children no longer need them , they feel useless or feel a need to be on their own . " <p> The seniors ' quest for independence can be seen on several fronts : <p> * In San Francisco 's Chinatown , the number of Asians 65 or older living alone rose by 89 percent between 1980 and 1990 , from about 700 to about 1,300 , according to Census reports . The Tenderloin and South of Market showed similar increases . <p> * Asians make up about half of the seniors on the waiting list for low-cost housing at the San Francisco Housing Authority , said Mike Wong , the agency 's diversity coordinator . <p> * Agencies that serve the elderly , including Self-Help for the Elderly , say they are dealing with more and more seniors who are living independently . The groups provide job training , community centers and housing referrals . <p> For most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a practical decision . Although suburbia offers more comfortable living conditions , they felt isolated and bored . <p> FEELING AT HOME <p> On the other hand , downtown communities give them a chance to make their culture a part of their daily lives , said Fernando Cheung of the Oakland Chinese Community Council . <p> " They can buy the food they like , " he said . " They can speak to the shopkeepers . They can come to the senior centers . If they need to see a doctor , they go to the Asian Health Services . It makes it a lot more attractive . " <p> But life on their own can be tough . <p> Many end up living in cramped quarters and dealing with health problems that need constant attention , Cheung said . And although nonprofit organizations have helped to open more community centers for seniors in the last 10 years , agencies serving the elderly are now bracing for shortages of funds . <p> For many seniors , the inconveniences are outweighed by the rewards of gaining control of their lives . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own since 1981 . A native of Hong Kong , she walks with a cane and speaks very little English , but she leads an active life in Oakland 's Chinatown . Every week , she does her own shopping and housekeeping and passes time with other old people at the local senior center . <p> " I have a lot of things to do , " she said in an interview at the Oakland Chinese Community Council , where other elderly Asians gather to chat , play bingo or read Chinese-language newspapers . " I have to do everything myself . " <p> Chan , who asked not to be identified by her full name , said she left her son 's house because her Chinese daughter-in-law was always reminding her : " In America , sons do n't live with their mothers . " <p> DIFFERENT VALUES <p> Other seniors tell similar stories of how they could not get along with children  --  and the spouses of their children  --  who have acquired values too American for their taste . <p> Trinh Ha , a 69-year-old Vietnamese woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is " very , very Westernized . " Her litany of grievances included his refusal to use the Vietnamese lunar calendar and he and his wife 's penchant for perfumed soap . <p> " They use one soap for washing , one for taking showers  --  I 'm used to having just one soap for everything , " she said , shaking her head . " All the little things irritate me . Too many small things accumulate , and it becomes a problem . " <p> NO RESPECT FOR ELDERS <p> Many immigrants from cultures where parents rule supreme over the family can not accept the erosion of their authority . " In China , the parents are always the head of the household , " said Lynn Fang of Self-Help for the Elderly in San Francisco . " But then that 's not the case when they come here . " <p> Frank , 65 , a Filipino who asked not to be identified by his full name , complained that his daughter treats him like a child . They still live together , but he is considering moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't answer back , " he said bitterly . " Because if I answer her , she 'll feel hurt , because I can say some nasty things . " <p> In some cases , parents leave after suggestions , direct or indirect , that they are no longer welcome in their children 's home . <p> Chung , who left his daughter 's East Bay home in tears , said his Caucasian son-in-law always addressed him by his first name , which he found offensive . His son- in-law also told him that in the United States , children are not responsible for their parents . <p> This offended Chung 's sense of propriety . " You raise your children to take care of you when you get old , " he observed sternly . " You save rice so you do n't starve . " <p> ALONE BUT INDEPENDENT <p> Realizing that the old traditions no longer hold , many Asian seniors map out alternative futures . And for many , moving out is the only way to preserve their self- esteem . <p> " When you reach our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to feel that you 're dependent on your children for what you eat everyday , " said Luis , a 71-year-old Filipino who asked not to be identified by his real name . He left his daughter 's home recently and now shares a South of Market apartment with his wife and sister-in- law . " Just because we 're old , we do not expect them to take care of us , " he said . <p> When Evelyn Gomez , a 66-year- old Filipina , was widowed two years ago , her children asked her to live with them . She refused , saying , " You have your own families , I 'd rather be alone . " <p> " If I live with them , I 'll end up tagging along , but I see that they want their privacy , " said Gomez , who now lives at a senior housing complex in Daly City . " That was also my experience when I first got married . " <p> Qui Rui Ping , 68 , arrived from China three years ago , and was living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his wife decided to move out . His 39-year-old son tried to dissuade them , invoking the Chinese tradition of filial responsibility . <p> But Qui said he wanted to work with and be around other Chinese people , so he and his wife moved a year ago to Chinatown , where he now works as a senior aide for the Oakland Chinese Community Council . <p> " I wanted to find friends , lots of friends , " he said through an interpreter . " To be able to work is to realize one 's self-worth . Mentally , I become more satisfied . " <p> TIME FOR HOBBIES <p> For Luis , independence has allowed him to indulge in one of his lifetime passions  --  dancing . He goes to dance halls three times a week and keeps a typewritten guide to senior dance parties in his wallet . He once shocked a younger relative by showing him how to dance the Electric Slide . <p> " We have all the time to do nothing , " he said . <p> Luis , Qui and Gomez still see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their children have actually improved . <p> Some social workers and academics stress that separation is not always a bad thing . " We have so romanticized the extended family , " said Carol Haber , a history professor at the University of North Carolina , Charlotte , and co-author of a recent book on aging in U.S. society . " Living in separate households is not the same as isolation or neglect . . . . Just because they live in separate households , it does n't mean that their relations are worse . "
