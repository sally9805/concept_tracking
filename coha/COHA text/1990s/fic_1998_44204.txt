It was a good time for Jews in Rome , early in the twelfth century of the Christian era , even though the city was a shattered relic , reduced to ashes , ruins , and twenty thousand souls . How many Jews ? A few hundred , most of them living in Trastevere , less than a mile from the Vatican hill , before they were forced to wear yellow badges , before their humiliation in the carnival races , before the ghetto . <p> When church bells rang , the Jews bowed their heads to listen . First the Lateran basilica , far off in the southeast , tolling the Angelus : Turn ! Turn ! Dor-mi-tum numquam ae-vum ! Santa Maria Maggiore followed : Life is short , do n't get caught ! Next , the black bell of Santa Maria in Cosmedin , just across the river : Turn , turn , before you burn ! Then , one after the other , bells of San Clemente , San Salvatore by the bridge , San Giovanni out west by the Aurelian wall . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bells in a herd of goats , but when the one they called Navi , the prophet , shining like gold in the Roman sun , the bell of Santa Maria in Trastevere , a great bell with a tiny Star of David engraved on the rim , swung its mouth east and west , they lifted their heads . Sh'ma ! Sh'ma ! This bell of Rome sang for Jews . <p> Reuben the bellmaker , may his light continue to shine , son of Gershom the bellmaker , taught them to hear many voices in every stroke , to identify the overtones , distinguish hum note , strike note , upper partials . In the house of prayer , he stepped up to the bema , raised his arms . " The alef note rings for Gentiles , " he said , " because they own the bell . But do you hear the shadow alef , softer , deeper , a diapason beyond the fundamental ? Hear it humming ? Now the gimmel , listen for it , just a whisper . Gimmel is for Rome , may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Jew . But dalet belongs to the children of Israel , dalet sings Sh'ma ! Sh'ma ! Sh'ma ! " Cupping a hand behind his ear , he asked , " Do you hear dalet ? Children , open your ears ! " <p> The church owns the bell , Reuben said , but sound belongs to the Master of the Universe . Even before Creation , when everything was nothing , the voice of the Holy One , Blessed be He , sang over the deep . <p> Jews lived here and there across the Tiber , but Trastevere was known as the Jewish quarter . Not a ghetto . Christians lived there as well , including the lions of Trastevere , the noble Pierleone family . Peter , son of Peter Leo , son of Leo , son of Benedict , rebuilt the church of Santa Maria in Trastevere . He was the richest signore in Rome , the Pierleone who became Pope Anacletus II . Even his enemy , the treacherous monk Papareschi , a puppet of the murderous Frangipani , even he grew up in Trastevere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Jews , I do n't want you to think they were relieved of fear , or the Tiber flowed with milk and honey , or the Evil One forgot where they lived . The time was a little better than the past , a lot better than the future , and the Holy One , Blessed be He , gave them wise rabbis , learned scholars , alert protectors . Distinguished Jews were brokers , bankers , physicians , advisors to the papal court . Eight hundred sixty years ago , that 's when , during the pontificate of Anacletus II . Maybe you think I 'm making it up , maybe you 'll look in the list of popes and tell me Anacletus II was a false pope . That 's because those depraved murderers , the Frangipani , who hated the Pierleone family , played a trick on history , chose their puppet in an illegal election , named him Pope Innocent II . Every morning , Reuben included them in his meditations . May the Holy One strike them with pestilence , fever , and drought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children , may their carcasses be food for birds of the sky and beasts of the earth . <p> Even his enemies conceded that Peter Pierleone was elected by a majority of the college of cardinals . In the Christian year II30 , Rome paid homage to him sitting on the papal throne as Anacletus II . On the night before the procession , torches lit the streets , lamps glowed on roofs , lanterns were strung from house to house . <p> Jews danced in the wedding hall and rejoiced in the streets , rejoiced with hymns and banners , sang loudly , The Jews of Susa shouted with joy when they saw Mordecai robed in purple . On the bank of the Tiber they raised their arms , sang Yigdal Elohim . Rabbi Daniel prayed aloud , Blessed art Thou , King of the Universe , who performed a miracle in this city . A Jewish delegation crossed the river , waiting for the papal procession . Murderous Frangipani scowled , observing from a distance . " How sweetly they receive one of their own , " growled a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Torah scroll on his shoulder , waited next to Rabbi Nathan , author of the Talmudic dictionary , who held the text of a speech expressing the esteem of the Jewish community . They stood by the Palace of Cromatius near the east bank , the ancient fragment of a temple devoted to astronomy , covered with mosaics displaying celestial signs . They waited in vain . Anacletus II , wearing silk garments covered with jewels , a gold crown on his head , mounted on a white horse , surrounded by horsemen and foot soldiers , never returned across the bridge , never paused at the Palace of Cromatius to receive the Torah scroll from Rabbi Daniel , because his procession ended at St. Peter 's . This was the first sign the new pope intended to shift the papal cathedral from Lateran to Vatican . It was the sensible thing to do . Pierleoni strength was in the west , while Frangipani dominated the east . <p> The Lateran in the southeast stood at least five miles away from the Vatican in the far northwest . Frangipani @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Colosseum , less than a mile away . They erected towers and houses all over the Palatine and the Forum , with their mansion at the Arch of Titus , a flightshot away from the Colosseum . No Jew voluntarily passed through the Arch of Titus , because the sculpture inside it represented the triumphal procession after the conquest of Jerusalem , showing the Great Menorah , spoils from the Temple , captive Jews . The Frangipani took it over , built their house on and around it , made the arch an entrance to a fortress . <p> The Pierleoni built towers and mansions in the west , with a great house in the Theater of Marcellus near the east bank , and fortresses controlling Tiber Island as well as Trastevere . Almoners of the great house fed men and women at the gate , doling each one a pound of bread , two cups of wine , a bowl of meat . The ordinary people of Rome , except for servants of Frangipani , loved the Pierleone family . <p> Years before , when Peter Pierleone was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all over , speaking to everyone . When he passed their way , Jews said to one another , There 's a lion in the streets . He walked like an ordinary man , but dressed in silk , fur , and jewels . That was before cardinals wore berets and red garments to identify their office . One Sabbath , he sought Reuben at home . Like a neighbor , he insisted . <p> Reuben the bellmaker , son of Gershom the bellmaker , unbarred the door , released the latch , stood at the doorway with his only child , Lily , clinging to his robe . He hesitated , looked nervously at the cardinal , who wore a white silk cape lined with scarlet , and a soft hat with a round crown and a wide brim turned up , standing between two cowled men in shining white robes . The lion of Trastevere smiled . " Worthy neighbor , is that fear or wonder on your face ? As if we 're the three from the oaks of Mamre . " <p> " Welcome to my house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> " Come to my country , Reuben . " <p> " What country , excellency ? " <p> " A country without land , where kings and queens and soldiers march without souls . Catch my king and all is lost . " <p> Reuben , who loved the game , smiled , relaxed , modestly replied , " I 'm not much of a player , your excellency . Try Rabbi Daniel . " <p> " Rabbi Daniel wins every time , " the cardinal replied . Glancing down at Lily , who put her thumb in her mouth , he added , " Bring the little one . You can trust my cook . She 'll give her sweets prepared according to your law , I promise . Midafternoon , day after tomorrow . I 'll expect you . " At the appointed time , they walked to the palazzo from their home near the river on the other side of the church , walked up the hill to the large building made of brick , with a plain , undecorated exterior . Three generations had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little hill in the middle of Trastevere , a hill Jews called Mount Ararat . The front of the palazzo faced the church in which Baruch , great-grandfather of Peter Pierleone , was baptized and changed his name to Benedict . <p> The air felt chilly . Lily was bundled in lambswool , and Reuben wore his best clothes , long , black tunic under a wool shirt with fringes of tallit hanging below the hem of the shirt , a fur-trimmed coat with a large collar , and a fur cap . Lily skipped , hopped , jumped , but held Reuben 's hand . " Can I really eat there , Abba ? " <p> " Rabbi Daniel says his excellency is not a man to be distrusted . That must be a wise saying , because I 'm not sure what it means . " <p> " If the cook swears it has no flesh , no milk , no wine , can I eat it ? " <p> " Ask for figs and honey , that 's safe . " <p> A servant led them into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room on the second floor , decorated with flowers arranged on tables covered by flame-red cloths of finest wool , a room with windows facing the church . The circular hearth in the middle was swept clean . A carpet of many colors covered most of the shiny scrubbed floor , and tapestries brightened panelled walls of dark polished wood . <p> Reuben hesitated on the threshold , noticing a silver lion on the doorpost . He touched it with his fingertips , thinking the lion 's paw large enough to hold a little scroll of parchment . How goodly are your tents , O Jacob , your dwelling places , O Israel . A monk in a white robe greeted them at the doorway , led them into the room . Peter Pierleone stood up , held out his hand . " Reuben and child of Reuben , bless you both . " <p> Reuben drew back two steps , bowed , and said , " May the Holy One grant you long life and years of plenty . " <p> " And peace shall be added to you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back of it . The white monk stepped aside , stood against a tapestry . Peter , glancing at the monk , explained , " He 's my shadow . Feel easy in his presence . " The tapestry showed the courtyard of a great house . Over the roof , the hand of God made a sign of benediction . Blessed is the man who feareth the Lord . A rich man was carrying out works of mercy , handing out bread while servants tended the sick , clothed the naked . Wealth and riches are in his house , and his beneficence lasts forever . Men armed with spears and shields stood in portals on the left . His seed shall be mighty on earth . Below them , in the lower left corner , a troop of armed men shrank from the scene , commanded by a wicked angel . The wicked shall melt away . The desire of the wicked shall perish . <p> Peter sat opposite Reuben at a round table inlaid with polished oak . They sat on velvet cushions in high-backed chairs decorated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shapes of human heads , hanging over them . A servant brought in glasses and a beaker of wine . Reuben noted with surprise a jug marked with the Star of David and the seal of Moshe the winemaker . The cardinal broke the seal and poured , explaining , " Since it 's unlawful for a Jew to drink wine handled by Gentiles , Rabbi Daniel brings his own . My hands go no further than the clay vessel . You can drink the wine . " <p> Lily stood at Reuben 's side , her hand twisting in the skirt of his tunic , until a large woman in a white apron beckoned from an open door that led to the interior of the house . Reuben whispered in her ear , " Figs and honey , " gestured for her to go . Lily passed through the doorway , following the cook to the kitchen . <p> The white shadow set a wood board of painted squares between them and a box of silver pieces . Peter scooped out thirty-two carved silver pieces , half of them polished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What war do you play , Reuben ? " <p> " Usually Jeroboam against Rehoboam . " <p> Peter shook his head . " Rehoboam bores me . He 's incompetent . " Arranging pieces on the board , he spoke with authority , spoke in a voice of command , no longer playing the part of a cajoling neighbor on Reuben 's doorstep . " Do you like Saul ? Poor old Saul is my favorite king . Let 's play Saul against David . You take King David . " He turned the board , giving the white pieces to Reuben . <p> " Gentiles play by different rules , " Reuben said . <p> Peter 's voice softened . " I 'll play by your rules . " <p> " You call the piece at the king 's side the counsellor , and you limit his move to one square . " <p> Peter Pierleone touched the black piece by his king . " But you call it the queen . " <p> " Because it 's written in the royal wedding psalm , On your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you grant her the most powerful moves on the board . " <p> " How do you know our rules ? " <p> " Your queen is great because the game was a gift from the Queen of Sheba . After Sheba left , King Solomon sat in the crystal palace and played against his ministers , rarely missed a Sabbath . That 's why Jews play the Sheba game on Sabbath with silver pieces . " <p> Reuben touched each piece . " King , queen , two prophets-you call them runners . Two horsemen , two generals-I believe your name for them is castles . And eight soldiers . " <p> Peter touched each white piece . " King David and Queen Bathsheba , we know what a powerful woman she was . " Then he touched the black queen . " The Bible is reticent about Saul 's wives . It does n't even tell us he married the woman of Endor . I choose her as my queen . " Returning to the white pieces , he exclaimed . " Here are your two prophets . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wise woman of Tekoa . Abishai and Asahel ride the horses . Your generals are Joab and Benaiah , of course . In the front row , here are your foot soldiers : Shammah , Elika , Jehoshaphat , Eleazer , Adoram , Elhanan , Zelek , and Uriah the Hittite . You start . " <p> Reuben moved a foot soldier two squares before King David . Peter responded by sliding a foot soldier two squares ahead of his own queen 's prophet . " The Maccabee defense ! " Reuben exclaimed . " How do you know it ? " <p> " From my father , who learned it from his . Undoubtedly , dear Reuben , your greatgrandfather and mine learned the game from the same master . " Reuben moved Bathsheba 's foot soldier two spaces . Peter captured King David 's foot soldier . " Uriah the Hittite falls in battle , " he said . <p> Why would he take the soldier at this stage of the game ? Reuben pondered over the silver pieces . Intent on avenging Uriah the Hittite , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With a cry of triumph , David 's horseman seized Saul 's foot soldier , but Reuben 's face fell when Peter ran his queen to a position three squares ahead of her general , attacking the white king . " Beware this mighty queen , worthy Reuben , my woman of Endor . King David is in mortal danger . " <p> Reuben laid down his king and said , " I told you I 'm not much of a player . That 's why I suggested . . " <p> " Rabbi Daniel wins every time , " interrupted Peter affably . He shoved aside the board , stood up , and taking Reuben 's arm , moved across the room . They sat together on a bench by the window while the shadow in the white robe gathered up the silver pieces . <p> " Righteous , worthy Reuben , I did n't invite you to my home for your skill in the Sheba game . " <p> " What do you require of me , your excellency ? " <p> " I asked you to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " I 'm only a craftsman pursuing the trade of my ancestors . " <p> " Your ancestors dwelled in Rome longer than mine , dear Reuben . I ask a boon for all our neighbors in Trastevere . " <p> " What 's your wish ? " <p> " A new bell , Reuben . A sweet bell for my church to sing for us all . Will you make one for me ? I 'll fill your purse . " <p> " No more than what I charge for my work . Save your gold and silver for the casting . For you , excellency , I 'll make a bell that will charm the ears of God . " Reuben noticed the white shadow moving away from the tapestry on the wall , silently moving closer . <p> Peter took Reuben 's arm , guided him to the window . " I 'm rebuilding her fabric , but I want her to sing ! " <p> " Lord , we will sing thy praises , " said Reuben . The glow on the cardinal 's face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small , I 'll pull it down , build another . What determines the size of a bell , good Reuben ? " <p> " Dimensions of the head , your excellency . Diameter of the rim is twice the diameter of the head and equal to height of the bell . Outer circumference is seven times the height . I think your tower will be adequate . " <p> " Worthy Reuben , clever Reuben , every bellmaker has a secret . What makes your bells sing like an echo from heaven ? " <p> " First of all the mould , your excellency . The inner mould of clay forms the inside of the bell . We shape it over a brick oven so we can heat up the mould . Over it fits a mantle , which shapes the outside . Between them we make a bell shirt out of tallow , a false bell the exact thickness we want . We melt the shirt and remove it , leaving exact space between mould and mantle . Then we pour liquid metal into the space . The trick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crack the mould . I mix the clay with manure and build a hot fire under the mantle . " <p> " Did you say manure ? " The white shadow spoke for the first time . <p> " Cow dung or sheep , it does n't matter , just so it does n't come from an unclean beast . When the manure burns up , it leaves a porous clay mantle that allows gases to escape . " <p> " Clever Reuben , " said Peter . " A good secret . " <p> " Other bellmakers know . It 's part of our mystery , but not a secret . We bury the mould and mantle in earth , stamping , tamping down every shovelful . Without the grip of solid earth , the pressure of hot liquid metal would burst the mould . Above it we construct a brick furnace to melt the metals in exact proportion . For your bell , I think , eighty parts copper , fifteen tin , two zinc , two iron , and the rest silver and gold , exactly how much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's your secret ? " <p> " I do n't hide it , proportions are easy to calculate . Then I prepare a brick channel to receive the blood . " <p> " Blood ? " asked the white shadow . <p> " That 's what we call the melted alloy . The boys who tend the furnace pump the bellows without a pause . I tap a hole in the furnace to let the hot blood flow down the channel into the mould . When it cools and congeals , the blood forms the body of the bell . I 'm careful to keep the blood clean and mix it well . If it 's not perfectly homogeneous , the tin separates a bit because it 's softer than the rest , and the problem shows up in the soundbow after years of pounding by an iron clapper . You get tin pitting-little holes that appear in the metal . They change the sound , and eventually the bell deteriorates . " <p> " They say your bells are made to last forever . " <p> " And tuning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know how to tune . The trick is to remove thin strips of metal from inside the rim . I work with iron and stone . File down the soundbow-inside where the clapper strikes-to lower the pitch , or grind down the edge to raise it . Very exact work , like cutting gems-if you take away too much or cut too deep , you spoil the harmonics . Tuning the upper partials demands utmost precision . " <p> " That must be your secret . " <p> " The Holy One steadies my hand . My secret is the words that go into the bell . " <p> " You mean prayers ? " <p> " Prayers too . When you hear the new bell , your excellency , you 'll know what I mean . " <p> The white shadow turned away , mentally composing his own secret . Reverend Father Bernard . The treacherous lion not only encourages heresy , but also commits foul sacrilege . Can you imagine the unthinkable ? Imagine him , cardinal priest of one of the most venerable churches in Rome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roman churches have always employed a few Jewish bellmakers , but it is an evil practice . The Jew confesses he smears the womb of the holy bell with excrement . You may recall a few years ago I assisted the curate at San Giorgio in Velabro when they installed a new bell . We scrupulously examined the bellmaker with regard to piety and doctrine before we engaged him . Then , when the bell was cast , clergy and choir sang a special mass as the workers poured molten bronze out of the furnace , and two exorcists worked north and south , east and west over the channel to prevent demons from entering the metal . A Christian bell requires a Christian bellmaker ! The Jew contaminates the Christian virtue of the bronze and tempts evil spirits to enter the bell . Finally , I must speak on a delicate subject because the Holy Ghost requires truth in the innermost parts . You know me as a father knows a son , and therefore understand I am not one to speak out recklessly or to hurl false charges . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murder a Christian child and pour his blood into the channel . I speak boldly about this matter because you will keep it until it ripens , and because I rest secure in the harbor of your protection . <p> The cook had strict orders about preparing food for Lily , but she gazed at the tiny child , felt her arm ( so thin ) , stroked her cheek , and ignored the instructions , serving flesh pie and tasty pudding . Lily chewed and swallowed till the food in her stomach crawled up her throat . In a small voice she called out , " Figs and honey , please . " Cook rocked her head in wonder and disapproval . Perhaps , she concluded , Jewish parents ate all the food and starved their children . <p> When the time came to leave , Lily walked home quietly , grasping her father 's hand . Her legs felt too heavy for skipping or jumping , and she wondered if the Holy One would punish her with a bellyache , or if her belly would cast out the unlawful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a sweet bell for him , Lily , " Reuben said . <p> She sang to her father : <p> Five parts copper , one part tin . <p> Add the blessings , put them in . <p> Silver and gold to make it sing , <p> Tune the bell and hear it ring . <p> Reuben nodded , but his mind adhered to the Sheba game and the noble lord of the palazzo . Shalom ! Peter had said when they parted . After dinner that night , Reuben opened the door to three men on the threshold , Rabbi Daniel , old Rabbi Yekiel , and young Reb Pinchas , the cantor of the synagogue . The cantor chewed the tips of his fingers . <p> Her mother withdrew , tried to pull Lily into the outer room , but she clung to Reuben . All three visitors sat on cushions as Reuben poured wine , recited the blessing . Lily sang to herself , Black beard , white beard , no beard . The cantor was young and fair with less on his chin than her late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fingernails , though , and they 're not kosher because he does n't chew his cud or have a cloven hoof . Do fingernails count as flesh ? It 's a terrible sin to eat human flesh . Better to eat animal pie and tasty pudding than bits of your own body . Why did they come here ? What do they want ? <p> " You were in the lion 's den ? " Rabbi Daniel spoke in Hebrew . <p> " He was gracious to us , " Reuben answered . Lily squirmed , hoped he would say nothing about her eating in the lion 's kitchen . <p> Quoting a verse from the story of Samson , Rabbi Daniel said : <p> What is sweeter than honey ? <p> What is stronger than a lion ? <p> " We played the Sheba game , " Reuben continued . <p> " He 's a fairly good player , " said Rabbi Daniel . <p> " Did you observe a lion on the doorpost ? " Rabbi Yekiel asked . <p> " Indeed , " answered Reuben . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Was the paw of the lion large enough to hold a scroll ? Of parchment ? " <p> " I thought it might . " <p> " Was there another doorpost in the room ? Perhaps a doorway that led into the house . Did that one have a lion as well ? " <p> " I did n't pay attention to it . But Lily passed through that door on her way to the kitchen . " Lily 's hand convulsed on her father 's robe . They turned to her . <p> " I did n't notice , " she replied , leaning heavily on Reuben 's thigh . <p> " You did n't notice ! " exclaimed all three . <p> Rabbi White Beard , in the high nasal voice he used to teach children aleph , bet , gimmel , dalet , asked , " What did you eat in the kitchen , my dear ? " <p> Twisting her father 's robe , Lily replied , " Figs and honey . " They turned back to Reuben . The rabbi in her mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the worship of idols . She protested , But it 's not a lie . I did eat figs and honey ! <p> The cantor sang another verse from the story of Samson : <p> Out of the eater came something to eat , <p> Out of the strong came something sweet . <p> " Did you see a candelabrum in the room ? A menorah perhaps ? " Rabbi Daniel asked . <p> " No menorah . A strange candleholder , carved in the shape of human heads . But you 've been there yourself . Why question me ? " <p> " Four eyes see more than two . Tell us what you noticed . " <p> " A monk who spoke little but never left the room , a monk dressed in white . " <p> " Exactly what did he wear ? Do you recall details ? " <p> Reuben stroked his beard . " White wool robe with a white cowl . That 's all I remember . I never saw his face . " <p> Lily spoke up . " I noticed a little black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waist . " <p> Rabbi Daniel turned to Yekiel . " Cistercian ! Same one I told you about . " Then to Reuben , " What an intelligent child . " <p> The young cantor sang a verse from Proverbs : <p> By her play a child is known , <p> Whether her conduct is pure or wicked . <p> Ear that hears , eye that sees , <p> The Lord made them both . <p> Rabbi Yekiel said , " I fear our friend is in mortal danger . Cistercians are his worst enemies . " <p> " Not as cunning as our friend , " Rabbi Daniel replied . " He has the heart of a lion but the mind of a fox . What a bold diplomatic move , to make one of them his counsellor . Through the eyes of their spy , he spies on them . " <p> " I do n't understand Christian politics , " Reuben complained . Rabbi Daniel swayed from side to side , as if intoning a midrash . He told how the war between the castles began in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to break the power of old aristocrats by leaving the city in the care of two new families , Pierleoni and Frangipani , how their rivalry divided the city , how Peter Leo became the most powerful nobleman in Rome but never turned against Jews , never denied his Jewish origins , how he loaned Jews money without interest , how his son Peter rose to eminence , how the family remained loyal to popes , how their enemies supported the emperor . Reuben nodded , grew sleepy , his mind wandered . Perhaps a bit less copper to raise the pitch just a little , more silver and gold , a shade thinner at the rim to bring out upper partials . " Reuben , you 're sliding off the pillow . Now tell us ! " <p> He sat up straight . " Tell what ? " <p> " Tell us what he wanted from you . " <p> " A bell . He wants a new bell for the church . A bell for everyone in Trastevere . " <p> Rabbi Daniel clapped his hands . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a collection . Let 's carry a box around the community and gather copper kettles , silver wine cups , gold jewelry . " <p> Reb Pinchas , withdrawing fingers from his lips , sang : <p> Take impurities out of silver before it goes to the smith . Take the wicked away from the king , and his throne will stand upright . <p> Reuben assembled workmen , dug a pit near the church , established a foundry , erected the furnace , shaped the channel . When he had prepared all the metals , he hammered out sheets of copper , thin as parchment , and brought them to his scribe , who purified himself for sacred writing by ritual immersion , prayer , meditation . The scribe spread a prayer shawl over a clean table , and Reuben gently laid copper on the white wool cloth . The thin metal sheets rumbled as he handled them , making faint echoes of thunder . The scribe engraved reverently , as if writing with a pen on a parchment scroll . Whispering over his head , Reuben told him what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are pomegranates and a circle of , golden bells . Every metal pot in Jerusalem and Judah shall be holy to the Lord of Hosts . Even the bells on the horses shall be inscribed holy . Hear my sound , my king and my God . He whispered over his head until the scribe filled the copper sheets . <p> Then , when raw metals bubbled in the furnace as a single liquid mass , Reuben threw in the copper words . He said a blessing , tapped a hole , and the steaming roaring molten stream rushed into the channel . <p> He cast the bell , tuned it , polished the surface . The cardinal sent a sculptor to emboss large words , VASA SAC RA LAU DO DE UM . On the rim , in tiny letters , Reuben engraved a Star of David and Ruben fecit . <p> At the end of May , on the feast day of The Three Marys , also thirty-third day of the Omer , a joyous holiday for Roman Jews , Trastevere dedicated the bell . A hundred men dragged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the church , the bell , and the crowd . Jews stood apart , on the other side of the church , where Rabbi Daniel , prayer shawl over his head , pronounced a benediction . Reb Pinchas sang , Yea he did fly on the wings of the wind . Christians and Jews , even a few Muslims and Parsees , hauled the ropes , hoisted it into the tower . Rouse yourselves and come , All ye nations . It seemed all of Trastevere turned out to cheer , praise , offer thanksgiving when the bell , shining like gold in the Roman sun , swung its mouth east and west and began to sing . <p> Who had ever heard such a bell ? Day after day , news of it spread . He maketh the winds his messengers . Even beyond Rome , a sound like the laughter of angels floated in the hills . " Do you hear ? " villagers asked . " It 's Santa Maria in Trastevere . " Everyone paused to listen . The Frangipani burned with envy . Iyar , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rain , but the summer remained dry . Clouds gathered , yet offered no moisture . Sivan followed Iyar without relief , and Tammuz brought hot winds that filled the air with dust . On the last day of Tammuz , a dark sultry day , when clouds hid the sun , Reuben crossed the Tiber to bargain with a Syrian zinc dealer in Cosmedin . <p> First , the Syrian whispered to a boy , who ran out of the house , then , before mentioning zinc , they sat on a rug and discussed the terrible weather , withering crops , dead fish in the Tiber , the rumor of German troops marching in the north . When they agreed on the price of zinc , the conversation ended and Reuben stepped outside . Two men waited for him at the doorway . <p> From their livery , Reuben identified them as Frangipani soldiers , a sergeant in a leather coat with a long dagger in his belt , and a tall slingman with a broken nose . As the slingman jumped behind Reuben , the sergeant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked down on him as a tower looms over a house . " Master Reuben we have work for you . " <p> They headed away from the river toward the Forum , Reuben walking reluctantly between sergeant and slingman . Lord of the world , my fortress , my shield , do you see what 's happening to me ? It 's Reuben , down here in Rome . You revive the dead , you sustain the living with loving kindness . Do n't forget you descended to rescue your children in Egypt . And do n't forget Reuben son of Gershom . They stopped at the Arch of Titus , entrance to the Frangipane fortress , and Reuben shrank bank . The sergeant laughed . " You do n't have to pass through the arch . We 'll go round to the back , to the servant door . " They led him into the great hall . " Master Reuben of Trastevere , " the sergeant announced . <p> Why does the way of the wicked prosper ? Why are the workers of treachery at ease ? Cencius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aged Cencius with white hair and smooth round face , the same Cencius who kidnapped a pope . Once , he broke into the church of Santa Maria in Pallara , hissing like a dragon , and seized Gelasius II , dragging him by the hair and arms into captivity . Peter Leo , father of Peter Pierleone , secured the pope 's release , helped him escape to France . Now this butcher Cencius , hands folded on the table like a harmless old man , smiled benevolently at Reuben . " Can you fix our bell ? " he asked . <p> The two soldiers , sergeant and slingman , accompanied Reuben to San Lorenzo , principal church of the Frangipani , a few steps away from the Colosseum . He climbed the tower , insisted they wait for him on the landing below , not wanting them at his elbow when he examined the bell . He heard the sergeant 's voice , raised for his benefit . " Tell me , Quickshot , why do Jews climb towers ? " <p> " To look down on Christians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heaven God will allow them to go . " Reuben inspected the cracked bell , deprived of its clapper , which lay on the platform , a huge pendant of bronze disengaged from the bell . Clappers are usually made of soft iron to avoid cracking the bell . Greed of spirit ! They had wanted the loudest bell in Rome , insisted on a solid piece of cast bronze . This bell is dead . They need to melt it down , cast it over again . <p> Once again he entered the hall . Dense clouds over the city hid the sun , the room grew dark . A servant entered the hall with a candle . Unwinding a rope from a cleat on the wall , he lowered a chandelier . The servant lit each candle and raised the circle of fire . Once again Cencius demanded , " Can you repair the bell ? " <p> Reuben pondered . What would they do to him when he refused ? Merciful One , you preserve your children against enemies , bandits , evil beasts . You kept me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . O Rock of my salvation , deliver me from this peril , guide my feet a thousand cubits from this dreadful place . Holding out his hands to Cencius Frangipane , he replied , " It grieves me to tell you , capitano , the bell is a ruin . " <p> " Then melt it down and cast a new bell . " <p> " I regret to say , capitano , it 's beyond my strength . When I finish the bells I already agreed to cast , I must withdraw from trade , for my vision is blurred , my hand without skill . " <p> " Remove him ! " Cencius growled . <p> As soon as he reached home , Reuben lay down on his bed , closed his eyes . " You went inside ? " asked his wife . He nodded . " God help us ! You saw how they live ? " <p> " Like a chandelier he should live . Hanged by day and burned by night ! " Reuben grew old , Lily grew up . As a child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him tools , made toy bell moulds out of clay , the Gentile laborers named her Tiny Princess . As a woman , when she tuned bells , supervised castings , gave commands , they called her Queen of Mud . <p> She dressed like a workman , even though Torah commands , A woman must not put on man 's apparel , nor shall a man wear woman 's clothing . The community indulged her crime , just as the men , indulgent and amused , had yielded when she was a child , when Reuben smuggled his tiny daughter under his cloak into the house of study . <p> " What 's that sitting on your lap , Reuben ? " <p> " The flower of my old age , " he had replied . <p> Her mother grieved . Lily the bellmaker ! How many men want to marry a woman who works at a trade like a man , whose face stays red from the foundry , a tiny woman with big arms from lifting . Men scratch at the door for the dowry , like dogs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of good character , one who studies , a man who knows the value of a woman . Does a man like that want a woman who wears men 's clothes ? <p> When she put aside work clothes , scorched , soiled , dark with soot , Lily wore dull garments , covered her hair with a gray kerchief . Unmarried women were expected to display their hair and enjoy bright robes . In synagogue she wore a dark mantle , covered her face with a veil . The Jews of Rome respected Lily , but her mother felt dishonored in her heart . Cover your daughter with clean , fair garments , writes Rabbi Solomon of Diphte . A maiden clad in embroidered silks pays honor to her mother 's household . She wept over Lily , a twenty-year-old maiden with a vile tongue for matchmakers , a tongue with no taste for the honey of courtship . Only Isaac the tailor persisted , wooing her from Purim to Purim . Evenings after Sabbath , they strolled to Jew Bridge , a section of the Fabrician span linking Tiber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Isaac courted Lily , they strolled to the bridge , accompanied as usual by Amah with the face of a wrinkled olive , the old slave Reuben 's father had bought from a Gallic trader , the woman who had nursed Lily , Reuben 's only child , who begged to be made a Jew when Reuben 's father died . As Lily gathered pebbles , the old woman sat on the ground , her back against a stone pier at one end of the bridge . Isaac stood close to Lily , watching her line up pebbles on the edge of the parapet . She flicked one into the muddy Tiber . " Lily , " he said . She flicked the next in line . " Lily , do you think of me ? " <p> Flicking another stone , she replied , " How can I avoid it ? " <p> " Lily , I do n't know what you think , " putting his arm around her shoulder . " I want to know you . " Another stone dropped into the water . Adam knew Eve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dinah ; Amnon knew Tamar . One by one , the pebbles fell , splashing in the Tiber . " I want to know what 's on your mind . Tell me your thoughts ! " <p> Lily gazed over the parapet at the wooden roof of a floating mill , rocking on the Tiber . She sighed . " You do n't : " <p> " Do I tell lies , Lily ? If you take me for an honest man , then believe I want to know . " She shook her head . " It 's not good for you to know my thoughts . " <p> " Only the Holy One can judge what 's good for me . " <p> Turning her back to the river , elbows on the parapet , she looked into his eyes . " I want a foundry large enough to cast a great bell . A good location might be in the abandoned garden under the east slope of the Gianicolo , where there 's plenty of room and where horses can drag in the sled of a huge mould @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as deep as the mould is high , and build a foundation of stones and day at the bottom , leaving a passage about two feet wide down the middle where the fire can burn underneath . The mould will rest on it . Next , we set up four posts around the base and fill the pit with earth . Then we bring in the mould and settle it evenly between the posts . The trick is to shovel out the loose earth from under one side of it . When it tilts over , we dig out the other side until it tilts in that direction . We keep digging each side until the mould goes lower and lower , until it settles down on the base of stones . Now you know what I think . " <p> That night , old Amah reported to Lily 's mother , " She drives them away like crows from the garden . " Lily 's mother frowned , and the frown lingered on her face , as if forgotten there . I know that look , thought Lily . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , curse the womb that gave her an unnatural daughter , plead with the Holy One to put yearnings in my heart . <p> Reuben comforted his wife , " She 'll find a husband better than Isaac . Talmud says parents must wait till a daughter is ready , till she says , ' I love this man . " ' <p> Lily dreamed the prophet Elijah came to Rome wearing the ancient breastplate of the High Priest set with cherry-red stones engraved with the name of Reuben , firstborn son of Jacob and Leah , and a robe with pomegranates on the hem , golden bells between them all around . A golden bell and a pomegranate , golden bell and pomegranate , all around the hem . The bells jingled , tikkun , tikkun , tikkun . Peter Pierleone grew larger . The Frangipani allied themselves with the German king , hoping imperial forces would eventually seize Rome and cut down the Pierleoni , whose possessions , wealth , and honors increased every year . Everyone expected Peter Pierleone , great-grandson of a Jew , to be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Pierleone , but a faction of new cardinals associated with the emperor 's cause , as well as the Cistercians and the Frangipani , formed a cabal against him . When Honorius lay on his deathbed-not a bad man at heart , the old pope , may he rest in peace-the conspirators carried him off to a monastery , and when he died , buried him there , holding an election immediately . They named Gregorio Papareschi , rector of a Frangipani church and a member of the cabal , as the new pope . In the early hours of the morning , while Rome slept , they seated him on the Lateran throne as Innocent II . <p> As soon as the news reached them , the majority of cardinals held an election , chose Peter Pierleone , seated him on the throne of St. Peter 's as Anacletus II . <p> Each pope declared the other an antipope . The people of Rome rushed to support Pierleone , and Innocent II fled into exile along with his cabal . Anacletus II , opening his arms to embrace the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulders of the Roman people . " The white shadow , still at his side , composed a letter in his head . His purse won him Peter 's chair , as well as the city . He bought the greater part of venal Rome , corrupting the great and oppressing the small . I am convinced , Reverend Father Bernard , the baptism of his ancestor was defective , and the lion remains a Jew . Now listen to this : Bernard of Clairvaux , spiritual leader of the Cistercian order , argued Innocent 's cause before the princes of Europe . He claimed Innocent was elected by the sounder part of the cardinals , and therefore should be considered the lawful pope . " Although he was expelled from the city , he is supported by the world . " The antipope , the imposter Pierleone , spawned by Jews , had the soul of a Jew . <p> But the happy city embraced Anacletus . Bright banners fluttered everywhere . Nobles rustled in silk , dressed their horses in purple , hung purple cloths from their towers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of harps , trumpets , drums , the clash of cymbals . The exultant new pope prophesied an era of peace , days of prosperity , years of comfort . The city will overflow with good things , and the Lord of Hosts will make Rome the city of his choice . <p> " The city is a cracked bell . Make me a new bell to heal the city . " Anacletus had sent for Reuben , who rode up to the palazzo on Vatican hill in the pope 's gilded carriage drawn by white horses with purple plumes . Anacletus greeted him warmly , and once again Reuben bowed , kissed his hand , but now the lion of Trastevere was the Holy Father of the Christians . The pope wore a white silk robe covered by a shorter gown , and a red velvet cape trimmed with ermine . A red stole , embroidered with gold , was draped around his neck , and he wore a red velvet hat with flat crown and wide brim . <p> Reuben looked around for the white shadow , but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thick carpets , tapestries on the wall , seated on gilded chairs , facing each other over a round table . " It 's too long since we sat together , Reuben . " <p> He remembered the time they played the Sheba game . Smiling , Reuben ventured , " I 'm not much of a player . " <p> The pope rose , fetched a wooden box from a place in the corner , sat down again with the box on his lap . His eyes searched Reuben 's face . " Give me a bell to heal the city . " <p> " For this cathedral ? " <p> The pope nodded . " You made a great bell for the people of Trastevere . Now shape an even mightier one for all the people of Rome , a bell for every corner of the city and the hills beyond , a bell to sing the glory of God and the unity of Rome . " <p> " For what time , what season ? The metal needs weeks to cool . " " Easter , the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Easter Sunday falls on the first day of Passover . I want to hear the greatest bell in Rome , a bell to sound the beginning of a new era , the end of conflict , a time of peace . There 's a bell in the tower we never ring because it 's cracked . Take it away , but do n't melt it down . Make the new bell out of fresh metals , purified and consecrated . When Easter dawns , your bell will sound the age of Anacletus . " <p> Opening the wooden box , he said , " King David dedicated to the Lord the silver and gold from all the nations he conquered . " He poured its contents on the table , pieces of the Sheba game-kings , queens , prophets , generals , foot soldiers . " I 'll send them when your furnace is ready . Thirty-two silver pieces . " The soldier in a leather coat , huge man with the neck of an ox , brought the news to the Arch of Titus , news about that Jew of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refused to work for Frangipani . That same defiant Jew is employed by the worm on Vatican hill to fashion a new bell for the church of St. Peter . " Leave Reuben to us , Master Cencius . We 'll amuse you with his screams . " <p> " I do n't want to hear a sound from him . The smell of that Jew is loud enough . Serve me with his silence . " <p> " Load up , Quickshot . On your mark . " <p> " Ready , sergeant . One bolt 's enough to bring down a Jew . " At night , with his eyes closed , Reuben imagined a bell to heal the city . Tikkun , tikkun , tikkun . Every morning he directed a crew of laborers , who carried their tools to the abandoned garden under the east slope of the Gianicolo . They dug a pit , established a foundry , built a furnace , shaped a mould , buried it in earth , constructed a channel . The pope came to observe , standing on the edge with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tied around her waist , legs in long muslin drawers , like any workman , sorting copper blocks in a corner . " She knows everything I know , " Reuben said , " and her hand is steadier . " People from every quarter of the city crowded the edge , drawn by rumors of a bell to summon angels . Frangipani soldiers mingled with the people . <p> One day , about dusk , a great moan like a rush of wind came out of the crowd . Reuben had fallen , struck by the bolt of a slingman , a rough iron bolt the size of an egg , cast by a Frangipane sharpshooter . It struck his head behind the right ear . His hand went up to the point of impact . Lily said he raised the hand an instant before it struck , raised it to cup his ear , as if listening to a call from the angel of death . He fell on his side , slid down into the pit . Rage flared on both sides of the Tiber , like sudden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city . Pierleoni troops occupied their abandoned forts and towers . Expecting to join imperial forces in the north , the Frangipani planned to march on Rome , subdue the city , and escort the German king to the Lateran , where their pope Innocent II would install him as emperor of the Romans . <p> The Jews prepared Reuben 's body for burial , dressed him in two suits of linen . Barefoot mourners carried his bier out to the Monte Verde graveyard between the ancient Jewish catacomb and the harbor gate of the Aurelian wall , and the bell of Santa Maria in Trastevere , the bell shaped by Reuben the bellmaker , commanded to ring by the pope , tolled as the mourners-women first , leading the bier-approached the Jewish cemetery , tolled as they lowered the coffin , still tolled as they tossed grass away from the grave . Since Christians were forbidden to approach a Jewish funeral , the pope stayed away , but on Vatican hill , the bell dedicated to Archangel Michael , guardian of heaven , rang the death knell-the first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Jew . <p> Her relatives came to the house , tried to comfort Lily , but she wept for Reuben , refused to be comforted , saying , " I 'll go to my grave mourning for my father . " The consolers sat on the floor with them , sat at the edge of Lily 's grief . Her mother sank into their compassion , and Lily thanked God they wrapped themselves around her mother , leaving her alone in the valley of the shadow of death , where the furnace of her mind poured iron for a band she wound around her soul , as a cooper fastens hoops on a barrel , lest she fly apart in a thousand pieces . <p> After the seven days , she descended into the deserted foundry , as if into Sheol , sat near the furnace , waiting for Reuben to load it with charcoal , smooth the bell mould with his hands , set bricks along the channel . Exhausted from weeping , she lay her head on bricks near the furnace , fell asleep and dreamed . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she answered , " Elizabeth , child of Reuben . " The angel of death spread his wings , dark as thunderclouds , bringing night to the space overhead . She could not see his face , but the sound of a bell came out of his mouth . Wait-for-the-time . Waitfor-the-time . Wait **34;295;TOOLONG . <p> She woke suddenly , alone in the foundry , looked up at the bright sky . A man appeared above , standing on the edge of the foundry , looked right and left to make sure they were alone . He gazed at her with loathing , spat into the pit , turned away . The pope sent a message to express his sympathy . She did not venture out of the house . A week later , the papal messenger brought Lily a clay vessel that contained figs and honey . The following week he brought thirty-two pieces of silver , pieces of the Sheba game . Days later , she received a scroll sealed with the keys of St. Peter , a sheet of parchment inscribed with a verse from Deuteronomy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even though his men are few . <p> The furnace of her mind cooled , and the iron bands released her soul . Once again she felt a sense of purpose . She returned to the foundry , and completed work on the bell . Now papal guards and Pierleoni soldiers patrolled the edge of the pit . <p> While the finished bell waited for the sculptor to decorate the surface , she walked up Vatican hill to measure once again the space in the tower , passing through the piazza unnoticed . The piazza was like Succoth , I tell you , all huts and booths . Below the steps of the basilica , she passed stalls of candle merchants , booths of money changers , huts of straw vendors with feed for horses and bedding for pilgrims . No one gave her more than a glance . She entered the tower , paused with her foot on the step , the knotted rope they used for measurements coiled around her waist . <p> One of the sacristans , a tall , bony man with one ear , blocked her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants to climb up to heaven . " Frightened , she backed down the narrow stairway , turned to leave the tower , but he jumped down and waved her up the stairs , mocking her with a low , courteous bow . The Duke of Aracoeli loaned his elephants , which joined an army of men , horses , and mules lifting the bell out of the foundry , to move slowly up Vatican hill , and settle it on a platform in the Cortina San Pietri , covering it with a lace robe , near the belltower . The pope named the bell Santa Roma , baptized it in the name of the Father , the Son , and the Holy Ghost . They removed the lace robe , kept the bell on display until after Palm Sunday . Then , as the elephants stood by , horses , mules , and men strained at the ropes , lifting the bell to its space in the tower with the pointed steeple . <p> Thursday , Friday , Saturday of Holy Week , church bells were silenced , and loud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then , on Sunday , Easter dawn touched the sky , lit the edges of towers and houses . As Vatican hill emerged from the dark , the new bell began , began , began to toll . The great bell of St. Peter 's , swinging its mouth east and west , sang to every soul in Rome . Sha-lommm ! Sha-lomm ! Sha-lomm ! <p> When the Jews gathered for morning prayers , the bell still tolled . Lily stood up in the synagogue . Cupping a hand behind her ear , she cried out , " Do you hear the dalet ? Sh'ma ! Sbma ! Sh'ma ! Children of Israel , open your ears ! " <p>
