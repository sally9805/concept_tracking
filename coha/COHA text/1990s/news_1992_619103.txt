<p> A dark , smoke-filled cafe . People dressed all in black seated around tables strewn with half-full coffee cups , intently listening to poetry . Stillness in the room as the words become political or personal  --  or scatological . <p> North Beach during the heyday of the beat poets in the late ' 50s ? No . A South of Market cafe just a few nights ago . <p> In the way that everything comes around again , a lot of people now fancy themselves poets and  --  to paraphrase some bad poetry  --  they want everybody to know it . The hottest events around the Bay Area may be open-mike readings at which aspiring poets pour forth in front of standing- room-only crowds . <p> By day , these readers work at prosaic jobs as computer programmers , certified public accountants and secretaries . But at night , they join the ranks of Ginsberg , Ferlinghetti , Corso  --  or at least McKuen . <p> This area has become a hotbed of poetry , as it was of comedy in the ' 80s . Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on at a cafe or club somewhere . <p> " In terms of the national scene , I think San Francisco is the laboratory of the spoken word/poetry scene , " said local poet Alan Kaufman . " It has the best poets . " <p> " There is a tremendous resurgence of interest in the open reading , and that is creating a renaissance of interest in poetry , " concurred Joyce Jenkins , editor of Poetry Flash , a Berkeley journal that has been around 20 years and publishes a comprehensive list of poetry readings every month . <p> Those close to the scene have different theories on why this should be happening now . Jenkins sees it as part of the same trend that has made performance art so popular among young audiences . The lines between the two have blurred , she says . <p> " Performance artists sound like poets , and poets are starting to look like performance artists . " <p> Kathi Georges , poetry coordinator at the Exit Cafe in Pacific Heights , said , " Many people do n't have the chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a poetry reading is about . " <p> The economy has also contributed to the burgeoning number of readings . Even established poets are having a hard time getting their work published . <p> " There is a need for community and for publishing that is n't met in print but is met at an open mike , " said Jannie Dresser , who coordinates readings at the Coffee Mill in Oakland . " To have five or 10 minutes to share your work with an audience is a form of publishing . " <p> Poets often take their work from one place to another like traveling salesmen and make changes based on audience response . <p> " The response is immediate , " said Quentin Baker , 59 , a high school English teacher in San Francisco who reads regularly . " I usually get polite applause . Nobody is overwhelmingly excited about what I write , but even that is good . You hear someone else get lots of applause , and it makes you dig down deeper for better things within yourself . " <p> There is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ featured at the same place the next week . Featured readers precede the open-mike segment . They get their names on a flyer , are often paid  --  or at least given a couple of drinks  --  and develop a following . <p> ECONOMIC INCENTIVE <p> At a time when many people find themselves with less money for entertainment , open readings are popular for another reason : They 're free . <p> Drinks and foods are for sale at most of the venues , but " people come for the poetry , " said Don Bocca , manager of Markey 's Cafe in Cotati , which hosts once-a-week readings . " They do n't really do much business for us . " <p> An open reading has some of the appeal of MTV . It happens fast . If you do n't like one poet , you need only wait a few minutes for a different one . At a typical open mike , 15 readers will be heard in an hour . <p> Because work is not submitted in advance , anything can happen , which can make for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Penn broke up three years ago , he showed up unannounced at the Paradise Lounge South of Market and read " all these horrible misogynist poems , " recalls Jennifer Joseph , who organizes weekly poetry events there . <p> At one open mike dedicated to anti-censorship , a poet took off all his clothes and read in the nude . He was n't censored , but a reader who pulled out a knife as a prop was asked to put it away . <p> Some of the poetry is intensely personal . At the Exit Cafe the other night , Russell Gonzaga , wearing his infant son 's pacifier around his neck , read a poem about the feelings he had seeing him for the first time in an incubator . <p> " All this chemistry , all this technology , keeping this little thing alive , " he reads . <p> Nancy Depper , a 25-year-old receptionist in San Francisco , read a relationship poem that included the showstopper line : " He is a thief and a liar , and I like that in a man . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jose , came to an open mike at the Paradise Lounge intending to read some choice lines she had written about her former boyfriend . <p> However , waiting for her chance in the limelight , she chickened out . " I decided I do n't like the poem , " said Hays , who read a less personal one instead . <p> Dan Drew , 43 , a Walnut Creek CPA , stood out among the other poets at the Paradise . They were dressed in black ; he wore white , including a Panama hat . His was the most unusual poem , sounding more like a detective novel . <p> " I have a pretty straight job , " he said . " Coming here is like free therapy . " <p> Other poets specialize in political poems , most with leftist leanings . The place to hear them is the Cafe Babar in the Mission . <p> IT 'S A VARIED AUDIENCE <p> The audience is as varied as the poets . Most listeners are young , but some look as though they were around to hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come because a friend is reading . At some point in the evening , they have a revelation that makes them want to return : Poetry is n't as archaic as it sounded in school . <p> " I came expecting it to be sort of cliche , but it 's not , " said Scott Karas , 24 , a student at San Francisco State University . " It 's fresher than I thought it would be . " <p> Kim Giltenberg , 23 , a secretary in the Financial District , feels comfortable attending readings by herself . <p> " It 's an alternative to music , which I also go hear , " she said . " I write poetry and am working on getting up enough courage to read . " <p> The poetry is n't the only reason readings have become so popular . They are a way for singles to get together . <p> " They 're great because you have something to talk about , " said Joseph , 30 , an office manager and part-time poet . " I met my boyfriend at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writer I had ever heard read there , frankly . <p> " If you see someone you like reading a poem , you can go up afterward and say , ' Gee , I really like your poem . ' Even someone who has n't read , you can still say , ' What did you think of that poem ? ' " <p> Jannie Dresser recalled the man who read a poem at the Coffee Mill about getting a vasectomy and having his surgeon sing songs by satirist Tom Lehrer while performing it . <p> " There could have been a woman in the audience looking for a man who had a vasectomy  --  you never know . Seriously , though , readings are a way to be open and reveal yourself and see others revealing themselves  --  and that breaks the ice . " <p> EXCERPTS FROM THE NEW POETRY <p> WE DO N'T WANT MUCH <p> We do n't want much , but when half the people we know who are n't homeless are having trouble paying their rent every month , something 's wrong . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a roof over our heads , mediocre food , a couple dozen guns , and the names , addresses , phone numbers and daily schedules of every fat-faced overfed CEO and every two-faced jogging vomiting politician around the world . <p> Kathi Georges <p> FIFTY DOLLAR BUDDHA <p> Your average L.A. woman , saddled down with plastic fingernails , glued-on eyelashes , mascara , nail polish , nail polish remover , 31 flavors of lipstick . . . <p> The nose job , the boob job , the butt cut , athletic tights and cross-your-heart triple overpass push-up-wire-enhanced suspension bra , carries on her person $ 300 worth of petroleum byproduct at any given moment .
