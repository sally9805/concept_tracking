When Jesse ( " The Body " ) Ventura starred on the professional wrestling circuit in the 1970s and ' 80s , he was usually cast as the bad guy . Decked out in a feather boa , sequins and the kind of oversize designer glasses Elton John made famous , the 6-ft. 4-in . Ventura would flex his muscles , glower at opponents and spit out such gems of wrestling wisdom as , " Win if you can , lose if you must , but ALWAYS cheat ! " <P> Now that he 's a candidate for Governor of Minnesota , Ventura , 47 , has hung up his boa and no longer espouses cheating . But to the state 's Democrats and Republicans , the former wrestler , actor and radio shock jock is still playing the bad guy . Most observers had considered Ventura 's shoestring Reform Party campaign an entertaining sideshow to the main event . Then a new poll in the Minneapolis Star-Tribune showed him with an impressive 21% of the vote  --  double what he had had a month before and within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a statistical headlock at about 35% each are the Establishment heavyweights : Democrat Hubert ( " Skip " ) Humphrey III , the state 's attorney general and son of the late Vice President , and his G.O.P. opponent , Norm Coleman , mayor of St. Paul . Now the Body is a supernova in the nation 's staid midterm elections . <P> Dressed in a burgundy blazer , faded jeans and a T shirt for an appearance last week , he quoted Jim Morrison , Jerry Garcia and Deep Throat ( the Watergate source , not the porn flick ) to lash out at his favorite targets : a corrupt campaign-finance system , the sensationalist media and , most of all , career politicians . Students in the audience at Northfield 's St. Olaf College hooted , applauded and did the Wave to show their appreciation . " He wants to help people , " said David Parker , a starstruck St. Olaf sophomore who plans to vote for Ventura . " He 's like a father figure . " <P> To pro-wrestling fans , perhaps . But could the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the political-science department at Carleton College , puts Ventura in the emerging populist tradition of Minnesota , a state that in 1992 gave 24% of its vote to Reform Party founder Ross Perot and in this decade has elected populists of both the left and the right  --  Democrat Paul Wellstone and Republican Rod Grams  --  to the U.S. Senate . Ventura 's campaign slogan  --  " Retaliate in ' 98 "  --  fits the tradition . <P> But Ventura 's prominence has exposed the shallowness of his positions . Last week he found himself in the awkward situation of defending his suggestion that Minnesota consider legalizing prostitution while insisting that he did not favor the idea . Even if Ventura does n't win , he may help decide who does . Until last week brand-name Humphrey seemed to be coasting to victory with a comfortable double-digit lead over Coleman . Not anymore . Now the race is so tight that whoever loses will no doubt insist the Body was to blame . <P>  --  With reporting by Kermit Pattison/Northfield           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
