Four NFL players prove size is n't everything . Photograph // Pittsburgh quarterback Kordell Stewart flipped a short pass to burly 243-pound runner Jerome Bettis . Nicknamed " The Bus , " Bettis 's favorite things are biscuits , gravy and running over defensive backs . After catching the football , Bettis took one step upfield . Before he could take another , WHAM ! He was tackled with such ferocity that he toppled like a big oak tree . Bettis looked around to see what truck-or big linebacker-had rattled his brains . When he saw who it was , he burst into laughter . His clock had been cleaned by the San Francisco 49ers ' Darnell Walker . At 5 feet 8 inches tall and 168 pounds , Walker is one of the smallest players in the National Football League . " I have n't grown much since I was born , " Walker joked . Walker is proof you do n't have to be a giant to play football . He 's not alone . There are a score of NFL athletes-real , hard-hitting football players-who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Take Tampa Bay Buccaneers running back Warrick Dunn . Despite his compact size of 5 foot 8 inches and 176 pounds , he was last season 's NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year . He also was the only rookie named to last season 's Pro Bowl , the NFL 's all-star game . " Size is n't the answer to everything , " Tampa Bay coach Tony Dungy says . " Dunn not only gives us a change of pace , but he 's much more durable than we thought . " The pint-size Dunn is so sturdy he has played in 67 straight games-48 at Florida State University , 18 with Tampa Bay , plus the Pro Bowl . Survival Secret : Vanishing Many of the NFL 's little big men say their small size is their secret to survival . It seems defenders often lose track of them . Photograph // That 's what happened when Oakland running back Napoleon Kaufman exploded for 227 yards last season in the Raiders ' 28-25 victory over Denver . With only seven minutes to play , the Raiders were clinging to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line . The ball was snapped and handed to Kaufman . Running straight ahead , he appeared to vanish in a forest of mammoth linemen . Suddenly , he popped into the open like a cork from a bottle . He did n't stop running until he reached the end zone , an 83-yard romp . " I was just looking to get a couple of yards , " Kaufman says . " Then I broke through , and I was free . " This scatback does more than simply run . He darts , dashes , dodges and dances to huge gains . His ability to scoot through the slimmest of openings also minimizes the punishment he absorbs . By the time a defender spots him , it 's too late to size him up for a crushing tackle . " It helps you last longer when you can avoid the big hit , " Kaufman says . " People often hit each other instead of hitting me square . " Go Away , Kid-You 're Too Small At Baltimore , the coaches thought 5-foot-7 , 172-pound Jermaine Lewis was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They forgot what I did in college at Maryland , " Lewis says . " I once scored four touchdowns in a game as a running back , receiver and punt returner . " His NFL breakthrough came last season . Showing he could play with the big boys , Lewis caught 42 passes for 648 yards and six touchdowns for the Ravens . " I may not be as tall as All-Pros Jerry Rice , Michael Irvin and Cris Carter Lewis says , " but my speed , quickness , good hands and ability to cut on a dime enable me to get open against any defensive back . I 'm also strong enough to break leg tackles . " A Human Road Runner When a football player does n't have size , he 'd better have speed and quickness . " Kaufman is the fastest guy I 've ever seen on grass , " Oakland defensive lineman Darrell Russell says of his team 's star running back . You 've probably seen " Road Runner " cartoons . Kaufman is just like that . Meep ! Meep ! and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 50 yards or longer last season . He had more long gainers than anyone else . Equally fast , Walker won the national 800-meter high school championship , and Dunn led his Baton Rouge , La. , high school to two state track titles . Thanks to his lightning speed and acceleration , Jermaine Lewis has become one of football 's most versatile players . In addition to being a top receiver , he led the NFL in 1997 with the highest punt return average ( 15.6 yards ) in 13 years . Says Lewis , " I think I 've proved the point that size is n't everything in the NFL . " Photograph Photograph Sidebar DARNELL WALKER AT A GLANCE Sidebar BORN : Jan. 17 , 1970 , St. Louis , Mo .
