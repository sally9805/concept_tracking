Rival campaigns laughed when GEORGE W. BUSH 's campaign paid $43,500 in a silent auction to rent prime space at next month 's Iowa straw poll . " They took the bait , " chuckled an adviser to Lamar Alexander . But Bush is laughing now . Rather than dip into his campaign chest , he had six donors cover the tab . Too clever , says Steve Forbes ' team , which charges that the end run is a violation of campaign laws that prohibit individuals from giving more than $1,000 to a candidate . The Bush folks say that since the money went to the Iowa Republican Party , they broke no rules . Perhaps that kind of fiscal ingenuity is why Bush has spent only a fifth of the $37 million he has raised and why he announced he would forgo nearly $17 million in matching federal funds in exchange for not being held to campaign spending limits . <P> AL GORE has already spent 42% of his purse on a busload of consultants and events like a do at Manhattan 's Pierre Hotel that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We are the cost-conscious campaign .
