Few children 's books evoke such strong emotions as The Story of Little Black Sambo . Its crude , derogatory drawings and racist character names are patently offensive , making it one of the best known relics  --  practically an icon  --  of a deplorable era . But Sambo himself is spunky and resourceful , and his story is charming enough that many adults remember it fondly . Now two publishers are trying to resurrect Sambo , preserving the good while jettisoning the bad in new versions of the mortifying old book . <P> That two retellings are coming out at once is , according to all concerned , quite coincidental . Both new volumes were created by respected figures in children 's literature , men in their 50s who were read Sambo when they were young but who 'd kept it out of the hands of their offspring . " As a child , I liked the little boy and the story but I felt very bad about how he was depicted , " says Julius Lester , an African-American writer who , along with illustrator Jerry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sam and The Tigers ( Dial ) . " The original is a little masterpiece , " argues illustrator Fred Marcellino , who 's white . " Its good qualities really outweigh its racist elements . " Marcellino has called his reworking The Story of Little Babaji ( HarperCollins ) . <P> The new books take somewhat opposite approaches to the story of a boy who tricks tigers into sparing his life in return for his new clothes , and then steals them back when the tigers ' vanity gets the better of them . Lester and Pinkney , who also reinterpreted the Uncle Remus books , have filled out the original narrative , setting the story in a fantasyland where every human is called Sam and animals talk ( the tigers sound like up-to-the-minute hep cats , saying " Ai n't I fine ? " instead of " Now I 'm the grandest tiger in the jungle ! " ) . Lester and Pinkney also give the story  --  originally written in 1899 by a Scottish woman and set in India but with minstrel-like black characters  --  a specifically African-American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He has left the original 's simple text as it was , merely replacing the characters ' names with Indian ones and adding sweetly spare new illustrations . <P> Although the book is not available in most libraries , HarperCollins still sells 20,000 copies a year of the original . But the tale 's reputation is such that the publishers of the new volumes were at first reluctant to resuscitate it . " There will be some people who think this is capitalizing on something evil , " says Steven Herb , head of the Education Library at Pennsylvania State University . But the authors say people 's initial horror is soon overcome . " At first people 's mouths drop open , " says Lester . " They say , ' Have you lost your mind ? ' But after they read the new version , they love it . " Perhaps even Sambo deserves a second chance . <P>  --  By Belinda Luscombe
