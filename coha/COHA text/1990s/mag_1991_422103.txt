<p> HOW THE TIMBER GIANTS FELL , THE LOTS WERE SOLD , AND TRANQUILITY REIGNED NO MORE IN THE FORESTS OF THE NORTHEAST . A LANDOWNER TELLS HIS STORY . <p> Until today it 's been raining hard for the better part t of two weeks . The road that runs past the Shatney farm  --  Shat Acres , we call it  --  is half washed away , and as we bounce around a curve our passage is blocked by a downed spruce whose roots have been unable to hold in the shallow , rocky soil . While I drag the chainsaw out of the truck and go to work on the tree . Lynn shows Allison , our two-year-old daughter , where the beaver have dammed the brook above the bridge and flooded half an acre of pussy willow , sumac , and chokecherry . The humidity is intense . A tribe of kamikaze deerflies , unhinged by my sweat , swarms around my head in a wretched cloud . and when I finally clear a path through the supine spruce I take time to combat them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impoverished pests in a New England forest , I think , the deerfly is the poorest . We lock the hubs in four-wheel drive and continue slowly , looking for a gap in the dense woods that will indicate the driveway to my father 's old farm  --  my old farm now  --  a place I have not visited for some years but that I remember to be thick with raspberry bushes . It is my intention to denude these raspberry bushes this very afternoon , and ennoble the dinner hour with the odor of pie . I am fond of pie . I start to salivate when Lynn spots tracks leading through an opening overgrown by skunk cabbage and we turn off the township road , pioneering our way toward the remnants of a stone wall marking the southern line of the property . I know where I am once the red pines replace the hardwoods . <p> My parents bought this farm as a summer home nearly half a century ago  --  100 acres , plus or minus , in the heart of the Northeast Kingdom : Greensboro Township @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barn , farmhouse , horse stalls , woodshed , and spring all needed attention , but the place was habitable . Out front and to the west were hayfields and pasturelands , behind the garden the woods sloped up to a ridge we called Sourwood Mountain , and along the northern boundary was a small lake that still appears on local maps as Mud Pond . <p> My mother and father planted lilacs and golden glow around the front door and a climbing rose along the stone wall in back ; they mowed and raked and painted . They spent the summer before World War II redoing much of the interior of the house . And then a conspiracy of events dominated by gas rationing and a move to California prevented their return to Vermont for more than five years  --  by which time things had changed dramatically . The barn had blown down in a hurricane , porcupines had chewed the supporting timbers of the house until it was no longer structurally sound , and all manner of critters had lived , bred , and died in the stud walls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which sprouted healthy crops of larch , spruce , and cedar . Mud Pond was beginning to show clear signs of eutrophic demise . <p> Even without a five-year hiatus , as absentee landowners ( a phylum referred to in Vermont as " summer people " ) there was no way my parents could have kept up what native farmers spent every hour of every working day laboring to maintain . And so the pile of boards that had been the barn remained a pile of boards , finally rotting and sprouting the magnificent patch of raspberry bushes I am about to pillage ; maple saplings joined the softwoods in a rush to reclaim the fields ; and the porkies continued to feed on the joists and timbers . Eventually we salvaged a few dozen adzehewn beams from the farmhouse , cremated its remains , and pushed them into the cellar hole . " New England wants to be woods , " my father said . " So let it be woods . " He planted the remaining open space in Norway pine ( a native tree that has nothing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hill above Caspian Lake in the town of Greensboro itself , and some years later , when I was grown and had a family of my own , transferred the title and tax burden to me . <p> Thus I , a Northern Californian , became the absentee landowner of a New England wilderness estate . <p> I review the above history in part because it occurs to me that the story of the Stegner " farm " is a corollary to a syndrome that has been seeping through many parts of rural America during the last decade . The hankering for a retreat in some idyllic outpost has become a middle- and upper-class American passion ; but on the crowded east coast of our nation it is a passion that many people believe threatens the environmental and social integrity of the entire northeastern territory . For the 70 million people who live within a day 's drive of the region , Eden can be had  --  and is being had  --  on a Maine lakeshore or a Vermont hilltop or a New Hampshire wood for a few hundred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 110,000 acres were chopped into lots in Maine alone . Unlike the West , with its vast buffers of public lands ( more than four-fifths of the Northeast is private ) , the only thing that has prevented wholesale development of New England 's wilderness is the unwillingness of its timber-company owners to sell . And that reluctance , as the recent leveraged buyout of one of the biggest of these timber companies suggests , may be short-lived . <p> The spectre of the subdivision of northern New England first appeared in 1982 with the hostile takeover of Diamond International , the giant lumber company that brought us , among other things , the safety match . Diamond , which owned about 1.7 million acres of forestland ( including 800,000 acres in Maine , 89,000 acres in Vermont and New Hampshire , and 96,000 acres in New York 's Adirondack Park ) , was acquired for $660 million in a corporate raid by British financier Sir James Goldsmith . To pay the debt incurred by his purchase , Goldsmith dismembered the company , selling its divisions , corporate headquarters , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and transferred title to the land itself ( which he retained ) to a Cayman Islands holding company . <p> In 1987 a French water utility , General Occidentale , bought the Cayman Islands company and immediately put the Diamond forests up for sale . While the state govemments hesitated over the price , a New Hampshire mobile-home-park and condo developer named Claude Rancourt jumped in , buying the land in Vermont and New Hampshire for $19 million . A Georgia-based land-speculation company , Lassiter Properties , bought the Adirondack forestland for $17 million . They proceded to do what entrepreneurial land speculators do : They set about to subdivide and sell once again . <p> Naturally , all parties involved in this series of transactions made ( or would make ) enormous profits along the way  --  except for the citizens of New Hampshire and New York , whose legislators belatedly woke up to the fact that a huge amount of pristine wilderness , critical watershed , and wildlife habitat was about to disappear . The two states came stumbling in to buy , at considerably inflated prices , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had outmaneuvered them in the first place . <p> The problem with the Diamond takeover , as a few people were quick to point out , was that it represented the kind of business transaction that , if repeated , could result in a wholesale change of land ownership in northern New England . The region 's timberlands are open to the public and serve as de facto parklands ; now conservationists warned that the millions of acres New Englanders counted on for their hiking , fishing , and boating pleasures could be put on the block . <p> It was a warning that , initially , went unheard . Not until Rancourt proposed huge vacation-tract subdivisions in New Hampshire and Vermont did the prospect of 90,000 second homes , condos , ski lodges , hunting camps , resorts , sports clubs , and what-have-you inspire widespread concern . It was pointed out in dozens of newspapers that 21 million acres of commercial timberland in Maine , Vermont , New Hampshire , and New York arc actually owned by a very few wood-products companies . If the giant Diamond International @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , probably nobody around here in East Jesus , Vermont  --  or so I assure my good wife . The newspapers are reporting the unfriendly takeover by Georgia-Pacific of Great Northern Nekoosa 's 2.1 million acres in Maine ( the largest landholdings in the state ) , but that 's just a timber company eating a timber company ; just a corporate bud worm feeding on somebody else 's spruce . No one is hungry for Mud Pond or Shat Acres . Plowing through the burdock that has overgrown the road , it is a little hard to imagine development of any kind occurring in these dense woods . I park the truck where the old barn used to be and we wade into the raspberry patch , pails in hand , mouths a-pucker ... only to find that the fruit has been stripped by a black bear whose lumbering path through the canes is as obvious as the undigested berries in the loaf he has left as a memento of his passing . " The glutton did n't leave us enough to flavor our corn flakes , " I observe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . " Bear poop . Bears like raspberries just like people do . " <p> " Poop , " Allison intones . <p> " I never did like raspberry pie . " <p> " Diaper ? " Allison suggests . <p> " I dislike seeds . " <p> Grumbling , we give up on berry-picking and walk down through the goldenrod toward the stone wall that divides the property from our neighbor to the south . The land once belonged to U.S. Bobbin , a company that made spools for thread ; we have heard that it recently sold to a conservationist from southern Vermont , and are therefore unprepared for the sight that greets us as we claw our way through a thicket of cedar and emerge into the open  --  the empty , stark , lifeless open . Stumps poke out of the torn earth , slash lies where it has been cut , deep tracks erode into furrows where the skidders have dragged their prey and the topsoil has washed down toward the outlet from Mud Pond . It 's a classic clearcut ; a nightmare photo-op @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen in little old north Greensboro ? Gaping and shaking my head , as if bemusement might make this go away , I wonder how much profit you can make by turning an insignificant 200-acre woodland ecosystem into a weed lot . <p> " Pretty , " Allison says , toddling toward a small patch of surviving milkweed . Not yet knowing how the world is supposed to look , she is undismayed by the way she finds it . <p> Her parents are more opinionated . Greed comes in all sizes , we observe  --  Goldsmith size , Rancourt size , local-developer size . We will learn , later , that our southern Vermont " conservationist " is in fact a small hustler who picks up remote , " unimproved " parcels of forestland for a pittance , clearcuts them , puts whatever he ca n't market as saw logs into a chipper , and sells the chips to a New Hampshire power plant for fuel . His unreal estate is now available in small lots for anyone looking to build a dream home in the country . <p> Unfortunately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world  --  unfortunate because their operations are less dramatic and harder to track , and their rape-and-scrape ventures seldom attract more than local notice . But their collective enterprise ( generally dealing in the 1,000- to 20,000 acre range , though often less ) threatens to fragment New England 's forests just as effectively as huge junk-bond takeovers by Wall Street financiers . To quote one Northeast Kingdom forester we encountered as he looked over the weeds and eroding soil of a recent 300-acre " development " not far from our own dismal discovery , " The local realtors are in a feeding frenzy . I 'm not worried about the timber industry mismanaging the forests ; I 'm worried about the forest being fragmented through development into little spaghetti lots like these . " <p> Happily , more and more people are worrying about both the timber industry and the developers  --  even some of those we elect to worry . A number of proposals have been put forth by various conservation organizations for the preservation of large sections of northern New England . One of the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommends establishing a 2.7-million-acre Maine Woods Reserve surrounding Baxter State Park ( at 200,000 acres , the only public park of any size in the Maine woods ) . The National Parks and Conservation Association has offered half a dozen suggestions for park creation ( or expansion of federally protected lands ) in both Maine and northern Vermont . Earth First ! modestly argues for a 10-million-acre biological preserve that would include northern and western Maine , New Hampshire north of Route 110 , the Northeast Kingdom of Vermont , unspecified areas of southern and central New Hampshire and Vermont , an expanded Adirondack Park , and the restoration of the Allagash , St. John , Penobscot , Androscoggin , and Connecticut River watersheds . In short , everything . Well , why not : If you know you 're going to get a lot less than you want , might as well ask for the whole taco . <p> In 1988 , concerned by all the aforementioned threats to the northeastern wilderness , Congress appropriated $250,000 for an assessment of timber resources in New York , Vermont , New Hampshire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. Forest Service in coordination with a 12-person Governors ' Task Force from each of the affected states ( three members from each state appointed by their respective governors ) . The Northern Forest Lands Study ( NFLS ) group , as it was called , was charged with identifying historical ownership patterns , with projecting the impact of change in those patterns , and with devising strategies to " consider a sustained flow of renewable resources in a combination which will meet the present and future needs of society , permanent public access for recreation , protection of fish and wildlife , preservation of biological diversity and critical natural areas , and new state or federal designations . " The task force was expected to survey all forest resources  --  fish , wildlife , recreation  --  not just timber , and was given a year to come up with a draft report . <p> Which , in October 1989 , it did . The reviews were predictably mixed : The timber industry applauded and the environmental community booed . The big problem , complained critics like Chris Ballantyne , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the report was silent on issues of forest health and biodiversity . Moreover , its strategies for protection were largely recommendations for tax incentives to the timber companies and gave short shrift to other options , particularly that of public acquisition . <p> The task force , assuming that federally owned land was anathema to New Englanders , decided that the political climate precluded increased federal , state , or regional authority in the North Woods and/or the establishment of any new or expanded national forests and parks  --  i.e. , public lands . <p> As they heard during 24 public hearings held for 90 days after the release of the report , they were wrong . A great many of the study-area residents , complaining that the document was a sop to the timber industry and that the only thing its recommendations sought to preserve was the status quo , argued for stricter regulation of forest practices and for increased state and federal acquisitions . Nor was public concern strictly regional ; the NFLS task force received more letters from Californians than it did from Vermonters . <p> Hoisting Allison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a skidder road to the brook that flows out of Mud Pond , where we wallow through a quagmire of erosion and silt banks until we reach the sanctuary of our own woods . " The task force may get yet another letter from a Californian on the subject of forest management , " I mutter to Lynn , taking one last look at our neighbor 's clearcut . <p> We pick up an animal path that leads directly to a lagoon along the south shore of Mud Pond , ringed by dead trees and choked with pickerel weed . From this point , we know from the topo map , we will be able to follow the inlet brook to an old logging road that bisects the property and thus circle back to the plundered raspberry patch where our lunch basket and a $1.99 bottle of Romania 's finest cabernet await us . Lynn points at moose tracks in the soft ground in front of us . Shortly thereafter she points to something else associated with moose , and I am about to repeat a dumb pie joke when she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his knees in the shallow water with a tatter of pickerel weed poking out of his mouth . Good thing I 'm now bringing up the rear . Best to shift discreetly into reverse and fade toward that old spruce . The girl and the woman will divert attention until I 'm safely aloft . But the moose stops munching only long enough to observe them with benign indifference , and after a few moments rips up another hank of weed , sloshes his way slowly around a point of land , and disappears . Allison waves her hands , pointing with glee . " Cow , " she says . <p> " Where 's your father ? " Lynn asks . I resent the caustic tone . <p> To its credit , the study team did incorporate a substantial number of suggestions made by individuals and environmental groups in its final report to Congress in May 1990 . More attention was paid to questions of forest health , and to the identification of forest resources and their use . The most significant changes , however , were in the range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquisition to the transfer of development rights  --  and the purchase of conservation easements and rights of first refusal . The report recommends implementation of existing-use zoning laws where such would be appropriate , capital-gains exemptions for sales to conservation agencies , and a host of tax incentives to encourage private landowners to keep their land undeveloped . Most important , it argues for the establishment of greenline areas protected by any or all of the above tactics through a partnership of local , state , and federal government agencies . Situational methodologies , in short , with an emphasis on cooperation and , to some degree , compromise . <p> The final report acknowledged that its drafters had been in error in their initial assumption that public-land acquisition is politically and economically infeasible . " A recent telephone survey of residents in several study-area counties found strong support for public purchase of land , " it admitted . Eighty-five percent of those polled favored public purchase for wilderness protection ; 80 percent for recreation opportunities ; 81 percent for wildlife habitat . <p> The study team should have known this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notorious enclaves of stubborn isolationism ( like right here in the Northeast Kingdom ) attitudes have long been changing . A 1988 poll conducted by a Sterling College student , James Cole , in the towns of Island Pond , Norton , Canaan , Bloomfield , Guildhall , Lunenburg , and Victory showed that 72 percent of the respondents believed there was a need for improved land management , and 67 percent were in favor of a Northeast Kingdom National Park . It is generally conceded that the era of de facto public recreation areas under the accommodating private stewardship of huge timber companies is coming to an end . If the region is going to retain anything of its special character . other institutions are going to have to take over . <p> " The next step in protecting the northern forests , " says Michael Kellett of The Wilderness Society . " is advocacy . " The recommendations of the task force arc now before Congress , but they are only recommendations , and it will certainly take prolonged , concentrated public pressure to turn suggestion into legislative action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress passed a Maine Wilderness Bill in September 1990 establishing the first federally designated wilderness area in the state ( 12,000 acres of the White Mountain National Forest , including the Caribou and Speckled mountains ) . It appropriated , as well , more than $1 million to establish a Northern Forest Lands Council to conduct research , inventory resources , and map the region . <p> On the other hand , Governor Mario Cuomo of New York declined to impose controls on 654 , 850 privately owned acres in and around Adirondack Park  --  controls he had verbally supported until pro-development interests began to howl . And bond issues that included money to purchase land went down in the November 1990 elections in New York and Maine  --  which means that none of the four northern states has any funding for that purpose at all . The clear message is that if New Englanders are going to preserve the environmental integrity of their region , they need federal support . <p> Indeed , preserving that environmental integrity is going to be a hard row to hoc , regardless of strategy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resident populations ( and even some of their advocates ) as strictly regional business . The fate of one wilderness is ( potentially ) the fate of all wilderness and is an issue that has little to do with regionalism  --  though I freely acknoeledge that the opinion of an outsider , flatlander , summer person , absentee landlord , Californian like me is not exactly the first order of concern to local communities in northern New England . I defend my position on the grounds that our Constitution and laws , the fact that we are the " united " states of America ( to say nothing of our fanatic belief in the right of mobility , the right to go wherever we want , whenever we want , however we want ) , give a Californian license to argue and agitate for the preservation of the northeastern woods , just as it gives a New Englander license to argue and agitate for the old-growth forests in the Pacific Northwest . " So think globally and act globally , " I yell , as I stretch out in the grass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheese sandwich and waving a carrot stick for emphasis . I am immediately reminded by my wife that I have not always been so pure of mind or large in spirit , that I too have suffered the temptations of the marketplace . <p> Okay , okay , so I once had a nonpreservationist impulse . Once . A while back the Town of Greensboro , with its insatiable appetite for more and more revenue , kept inching up the tax rate , then did a vague , aerial survey of the properties of all its landholders . I was informed that our plus-or-minus I(X) acres was more plus than minus  --  was in fact 200 acres  --  and received a staggering bill for reappraisal . Okay , so my impulse was to chop our outback into 10-acre parcels ( the minimum allowed by local zoning ) and sell it . " I 'll clearcut the sucker and turn it into hunting camps ! " I howled . " I 'll dust it with Agent Orange ! I 'll set it on fire ! " In the end , thanks to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I put my money where my environmental chin wags ) , I did not act on that impulse . Like my father , I decided to let it be woods . <p> Whether the owners of some 21 million acres of wildlands in New York , Vermont , New Hampshire , and Maine can afford to let it be woods , or are willing to , or are made to , is probably the most important matter that has faced New England in this century . But we can start small . I 'm writing the new forest-lands council today to propose a Mud Pond State Wildlife Refuge and a Shat Acres National Park . New England can have our bear , moose , and pickerel weed ; I can have a tax credit . <p> MAP : WHOSE WOODS THESE ARE Some 84 percent of the forestland in the Northeast is owned by just 45 different timber companies , paper mills , and local families . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : A dairy farm in Vermont 's Mad River Valley , where a seemingly imperturbable way of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COLOR ) : Wright Brook flows through Maine 's Mahoosuc Range .
