<p> Siding with environmentalists in a dispute that split his own advisers , President Clinton declared his support yesterday for tough new clean air regulations aimed at clearing urban skies of smog and soot . <p> Clinton 's long-awaited decision smooths the way for the adoption next month of the most significant rewriting of federal air quality standards since the 1970s  --  a change designed to make breathing easier for millions of elderly people and asthmatics while imposing billions of dollars in new compliance costs on businesses . <p> The regulations proposed by the Environmental Protection Agency will force scores of cities to either find new ways to cut pollution or face sanctions , including the loss of federal highway money . But the administration also sought to soften the blow with provisions that will delay the impact and give local officials flexibility in deciding how to comply . <p> Speaking in Nashville on a day when summertime smog triggered health warnings in dozens of U.S. cities , Clinton acknowledged the regulations would be " somewhat controversial . " But he added : " I think kids ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders who have complained about the possible impact of the standards on their economies , Clinton urged critics to " read the implementation schedule . Work with us . " <p> " We 're trying extraordinary new measures to give cities the means they need to clean up their environment so they can attract the right kind of investment , " he added . <p> The president 's decision resolved a fierce , monthlong internal debate that pitted EPA Administrator Carol M. Browner and other environmental advocates against White House economists who argued the new standards would be too costly . <p> It also set up a potential battle with Congress , which could try to block the regulations . Rep. John D. Dingell ( Mich. ) , ranking minority member of the House Commerce Committee , is one of several prominent Democrats who has threatened publicly to " go to war " with the White House over the standards . <p> " This decision unnecessarily complicates and delays the effort to clean the air , and I fully expect the Congress to exercise its Constitutional responsibilities in this matter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of condemnations from major corporations , trade associations and political conservatives . Jerry Jasinowski , president of the National Association of Manufacturers , said the regulations would " inflict terrible economic damage to our urban areas and undermine existing programs that are already working to make the air cleaner . " <p> But public health advocates and environmentalists cheered the decision and praised the White House for resisting pressure to seriously weaken the proposed standards . " These standards mean fewer sick days for workers , lowered health care costs and more kids in school instead of the hospital , " said Carl Pope , executive director of the Sierra Club . <p> The version of the regulations that Clinton embraced varies only slightly from the one EPA 's Browner first unveiled in November . The regulations set stricter limits for two types of pollutants : ozone , which causes smog , and fine dust-like particles called particulate matter . The EPA , citing scientific studies linking air pollution to asthma attacks and premature death , says current air quality standards are not adequate to protect the public health . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House economic advisers successfully pushed for measures that could delay the pain for some cities for a decade or more . <p> For example , the EPA standards on particulates would be delayed for five years to allow completion a nationwide monitoring network . After that , cities would have at least another two years to devise a strategy for reducing air pollution . In addition , the EPA agreed to be lenient with states that are participating in programs to reduce acid rain and restrict the flow of ozone across state lines . Administration officials said such programs could result in dramatic improvements in air quality , even before the new regulations take effect . <p> The goal , said Kathleen McGinty , chairman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality , was " not to reinvent the wheel but to work in partnership with states , local governments and industry to build on the many worthy efforts already underway . <p> The timing of the announcement , White House aides said , was driven by Clinton 's eagerness to have the decision made and publicly released before he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In recent days , European allies have criticized the Clinton administration for being slow to agree to a timetable on reducing emissions of green house gases blamed for global warming . <p> The decision had to be completed this week , officials said , because the administration is under court order to reach a decision by July 19 , and the Office of Management and Budget needed three weeks to review the regulations before they are formally submitted . <p> Administration officials said Clinton had essentially made up his mind before a final briefing was held at the Oval Office early yesterday , when he went over final details , with many of his questions aimed at how the proposal would be implemented . <p> Although the decision was viewed as a tactical victory for Browner , various administration officials made clear their resentment that Browner had been so public in her advocacy for stronger clean-air regulations . Although rejecting suggestions that Clinton 's decision had been forced , White House officials said Clinton did not appreciate public pressure . " He likes a good healthy debate , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the table . " <p> Others said White House resentment became muted in recent days as she showed willingness to come up with modifications to the rules to make their implementation easier on cities . Some officials said they believed Browner had not intended to pressure Clinton , but was unaccustomed to her policy pronouncements receiving such intense public scrutiny . <p> During his remarks in Nashville , where Clinton was participating with Vice President Gore in a conference on families and education , the president stretched to make the clean-air announcement relevant to the event 's ostensible purpose by emphasizing the effect of pollution on children . " Children with gripping allergies that they could have avoided if they had n't had to breathe dirty air do n't do as well in school , " Clinton said . <p> Harris reported from Nashville . <p> ** GLOSSARY <p> The standards that President Clinton endorsed cover two major classes of air pollutants , ozone and particulates . Here are some of the terms and issues involved : <p> OZONE <p> Often called smog , ground-level ozone is produced when sunlight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground-level ozone include automobiles , factories and power plants . ( Unhealthful at the ground level , ozone in the upper atmosphere helps filter harmful ultraviolet rays from the sun . ) <p> PARTICULATES <p> Fine airborne particles come from a wide variety of natural and man-made sources , including manufacturing , construction , transportation and agriculture . Scientists believe the tiniest particles are the most dangerous because they can lodge deeply in the lungs . <p> CURRENT RULES <p> Since 1979 , counties with ozone levels above 0.12 parts per million cubic feet of air are deemed in violation of federal air quality standards . For particulates , the EPA currently regulates only particles 10 microns in diameter or larger . ( A human hair is 70 microns thick . ) <p> NEW RULES <p> Citing new scientific evidence , regulators are imposing stricter standards for ozone and particulates . One new standard sets a target of 0.08 parts per million for ozone . The agency also for the first time is regulating particulates as small as 2.5 microns . The Clinton administration is planning to give local communities flexibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  perhaps up to eight years .
