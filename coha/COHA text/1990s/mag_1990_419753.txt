Section : Corporate America 's Most Powerful People <p> Here is the most comprehensive report to date on the 1989 compensation granted to America 's top corporate executives . These 800 chieftains earned $712 million in salaries and bonuses last year , plus a further $291 million in stock gains , mainly from exercising options . Add it up . A cool $1 billion , divided among 800 individuals . <p> Too much ? Some would say so , but when stacked against their companies ' combined profits of $175 billion and revenues of $3.46 trillion it does n't seem so high . A penny on every 2 1/2 profit dollars ; a penny on every 49 revenue dollars . Where the chief executive 's efforts made a visible improvement in profits , these efforts are clearly worth a lot of money . <p> Not every executive on this list deserved what he got . There seems to be a feeling that if you head a big company you should earn at least $1 million a year : A surprising 347 of our 800 reached or topped that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the help of stock gains , but 239 executives made $1 million or more in salary and bonuses alone , up from 208 last year . <p> With few exceptions , the 800 executives listed below run America 's largest companies .

Note that these gains are not always in cash , since many executives , including Coca-Cola 's Roberto C. Goizueta , hold on to their shares . <p> Craig McCaw , head of McCaw Cellular Communications , was the nation 's most highly compensated executive last year , earning $289,000 in salary and bonuses , and $53 million in stock gains . <p> McCaw aside , do these executives have enough faith in their own companies to invest a substantial portion of their net worth in them ? Some do , some do n't . The 800 as a group own $32 billion of their companies ' stock  --  an average of $40 million worth . The column headed " Stock owned " shows the value of each executive 's holdings as a percentage of his firm 's total market value . <p> In determining stock holdings we include shares of beneficial interest and shares held by an executive 's wife and children , even if ownership is legally disclaimed .
