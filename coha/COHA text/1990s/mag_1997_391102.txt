VERY SOON NOW , in the early moments of dawn , the sun will briefly illuminate a dying satellite . Deep in the New Mexican desert , a group of U.S. Army technicians will witness the moment and grasp it as an opportunity . The sun lights up the target . As if on cue , a high-energy laser beam streaks upward , traveling in the blink of an eye beyond the sky and into space , locking onto the orbiting satellite . Within seconds , the satellite seems to expand , and then disintegrates . The U.S. Army wo n't say exactly when this secnario will unfold , but a window of opportunity will open in the next few months as an unspecified satellite reaches the end of its useful existence . When the test occurs - and few doubt it will be successful - at the High Energy Laser Systems Test Facility ( HELSFT ) on the White Sands Missile Range in southern New Mexico , it may mark a turning point in warfare . For the first time , the military will be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bullet . Big Bullets - missiles - willl be answered by lasers . And the lasers wo n't emanate only from groundbased installations like the White Sands facility . In the coming years , planes equipped with lasers will intercept a squadron of space fighters armed with lasers will distroy long-range missiles before they get anywheree near thir destinations , eliminating as well the orbiting satellites that convey targeting information to the enemy . Missiles , in fact , are the catalyst behind the development of the laser as a weapon . Potential adversaries around the world are increasing their long- and shortrange missile stockpiles , and most experts think that in a future conflict , the enemy will also possess cruise missiles similar to those that have worked so well for the U.S. military . // How the Airborne Laser Works // How the Airborne Laser Works // Until now , missile defense rested on the concept of hitting a bullet with another bullet . But that 's easier said than done . The Patriot missile defense system used in the Gulf War was not as effective as reports at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroyed . Unless hit at a very specific angle and location , the enemy missiles broke into pieces , with no guarantee that the payload had been destroyed or that the pieces themselves were not deadly , particularly if the weapon was biological or chemical . With longer-range missiles , the problems are similar . A single missile can carry hundreds of submunitionssome as tiny as a football-that are difficult to track and destroy once they are released . Small , smart weapons that would act like bullets to destroy these submunitions are being researched , but numerous obstacles must be overcome . To date , tests of these weapons have been unsuccessful , and at best they may be effective only against a " rogue " missile fired by terrorists or by accident . They are also costly to build and deploy . The problems are compounded by the fact that current treaties prohibit the development of national missile-defense systems . In such an environment , the flexibility of laser weapons makes sense . This opinion has been given voice for a decade-its roots can be traced to President Reagan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " program . While only the movie of the same name has remained on the public 's radar screen , the military in the meantime , with the U.S Air Force taking the lead , has quietly been developing its own long-range version of Luke Skywalker 's light saber . Planes with Lasers At a distance , the unknowing could dismiss the airplane as just another jumbo jet , perhaps one with a few extra bumps and a curious-looking snout . But that blunt proboscis is the sharp end of the YAL-1 Airborne Laser ( ABL ) , the Air Force 's most novel aircraft , truly a weapon of mass protection . Flown by a crew of two and operated by a team of four , the Airborne Laser is designed to operate **25;1890;TOOLONG tactical ballistic missiles in their vulnerable boost phase , shooting down cruise and surface-to-air missiles , protecting reconnaissance aircraft from air-to-air missiles and peering deep into enemy territory with extremely precise optics . Boeing is the prime contractor , integrating the multimegawatt TRW Chemical Oxygen Iodine Laser ( COIL ) and the Lockheed Martin beam director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a converted 747-400F freighter . A full-power , flight-weight test is set for April of next year , and the big money shot is scheduled for 2002 , when the ABL prototype is to shoot down a tactical ballistic missile . The technology to build the ABL is within reach at a remarkable cost of less than $6 billion for a seven-aircraft squadron slated to be fully operational by 2008 . " The ABL will be revolutionary because of its ability to detect , target , and instantaneously destroy enemy targets at hun dreds of kilometers. , " says Air Force Secretary Sheila Widnall . " This will be the first time a nation has developed a militarily effective high-energy laser weapon . We believe the individual technologies are proven , but we must now integrate these technologies onto an airplane with weight and operational restrictions . " As presently envisioned , one ABL at a time will fly above the cloud deck at altitudes exceeding 40,000 feettracing figure-eight circuits , 90 kilometers or so , behind the front lines and extending its time in the air by using aerial refueling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up of modified F-14D Tomcat sensors , which provide a 360o field of view . Targets are relayed to a illuminating beacon that floods the plane 's nose cone with laser energy . The targeting illuminator laser then locks onto and begins to track the missile . At the command to fire , the high-energy laser punches a hole in the target . A nominal magazine load for the ABL will provide at least 20 shots . Costs are estimated at a relatively low $25,000 per mission . It 's a lot of bang for the buck , " says Col. Mike W Booen , USAF airborne laser-systems director . // Shooting Satellites from the Sky // Shooting Satellites from the Sky // Shooting Satellites from the Sky // Chemical waste is passed via a catalytic converter and piped through ejectors , leaving the plane as exhaust . This waste is benign , says John Waypa , TRW airborne laserprogram manager . " Over 90 percent of the elements present in the exhaust occur naturally in the atmosphere . " Satellite Hunter While technicians in White Sands wait for permission to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their ability to track and destroy a fast-moving object . The Mid Infrared Advanced Chemical Laser ( MIRACL ) , a complex array of telescope and mirrors married to computerized tracking and stabilization systems , is the most powerful laser in the United States . But the key component at White Sands is the Hughesmade Sealite beam director , which locks the MIRACL laser beam onto its target . Mounted on a 5.1-inch naval gun turret with a fast 350deg swivel motion , the 28,000pound beam director is surprisingly nimble . It includes both a small targeting laser and a 1.5-meter high-power aperture . The minimum range of the MIRACL laser is 400 meters ; the maximum range is still unknown . This laser has already demonstrated its effectiveness as a weapon . On Feb. 9 , 1996 , a short-range rocket was destroyed in flight over White Sands . This test was part of a joint effort with Israel to develop a tactical high-energy laser ( THEL ) . Such a weapon would be able to fire repeated bursts at the speed of light in situations in which a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is considered a tactical weapon because it is designed to protect a specified local area ; such a system could supplant the Patriot missile-defense system . Like the MIRACL system , THEL uses a deuterium fluoride chemical laser . Tests on a portable THEL should begin next year . In the meantime , the beam director points toward space , tracking satellites as a prelude to an attack that would cripple an enemy 's communication and surveillance capabilities in time of conflict . Space Fighters " When it absolutely , positively has to get there in 60 minutes . " That 's not the slogan of a new parcel delivery service . Rather , it is an expression of the strategy that is driving the U.S. Air Force into space . The Air Force envisions craft that return from space and relaunch in less than an hour . Military planners salivate at the thought of a squadron of these planes for reconnaissance , attack , destroying enemy satellites , and launching space missions . Photograph TRW 's Alpha hydrogen fluoride laser is designed to work in space and can be sized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any conflict , you want the high ground and space is the ultimate high ground , " says Gen. David Vasily , assistant chief of staff for the USAF . " Space-plane development had never been given a sustained push , because it looked like an expensive proposition without any probable combat impact , " says Merrill A. McPeak , a retired USAF general and former Air Force chief of staff and now chairman of the board at Pioneer Rocketplane , a Denver-based company seeking to produce an economically viable space plane . " The situation has changed , " McPeak says . " Due in part to the new emphasis on infowar , we now understand how important the constellation of space assets is . " They have the potential to win a war and could certainly lose one if they were compromised , he adds . Air Force Secretary Widnall seems to agree . " We must be able to access space-based systems-and space-as rapidly as we can now project a bomber to distant trouble spots . " It seems unlikely , however , that the world would tolerate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States or any other country . In fact , the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty of 1972 prohibits the deployment of space-based lasers . Having the same capability for a short time in a crisis situation via space planes would probably be more acceptable politically . According to the USAF 's own New World Vistas report , an assessment of 21st century defense requirements issued this year , future military space planes , manned or unmanned , will be equipped with lasers and be in operational squadron use by the year 2030 . In all likelihood , their arrival will come far sooner . The space laser itself may follow the lines of a TRW project that seeks to integrate the company 's Alpha high-energy hydrogen fluoride chemical laser , which performs more reliably in space than other lasers , with a Hughes 4-meter beam projection telescope and a Lockheed Martin beam control system . 1 his small Alpha LAMP Integration ( ALI ) system underwent its first test firing in March . ALl will likely be put aboard a space fighter that is a modification of an existing space plane design . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ X-33 and VentureStar ( X-34 ) reusable launch vehicles designs , scheduled to fly by 2004 " VentureStar : 21st Century Space Shuttle , Oct. ' 96 . The USAF has opened an office at the Phillips Laboratory research center at Kirtland Air Force Base in New Mexico to study the idea . " An orbital vehicle would be relatively smaller than the physical size of a B-1 bomber . We are looking for aircraft-like operations , and our main concerns are durability and reliability , " says Lt. Col. Jess M. Sponable , military space-plane program manager at Phillips . The VentureStar is on the fast track for development . NASA has already created an engine , appropriately called Fastrac , which will power the X-34 technology demonstration vehicle on its first flight in late 1998 . The cost of the engine was about $1 million ( about one-seventh the cost of similar engines ) . The Fastrac engine is about half the size and one-third the weight of a space shuttle main engine . Once deployed , the space plane , as well as the ABL aircraft and ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Controlling space , air , and land wo n't depend on how big or fast your bullets are but how powerful a laser you have in your arsenal . <p>
