It was supposed to have been Newt Gingrich 's valedictory , the week in which the first Republican House in 40 years could count its accomplishments before returning home to face the voters . As he sat last Thursday afternoon on the sun-washed balcony of his Capitol suite , the Speaker ticked them off : the line-item veto , a sweeping telecommunications law , a crackdown on illegal immigration , an expansion of health insurance , welfare reform , even a savings of $500,000 by ending daily ice deliveries to congressional offices . Then , in Gingrich fashion , he reached back  --  quite a reach  --  for a historical analogy . " You could make a pretty good case , " he said , " that this is the most significant Congress since the Great Society . " <P> At that moment two floors below , a bipartisan group of Congressmen  --  two Democrats , two Republicans  --  was deciding there might be a pretty good case to be made against Gingrich . After weeks of partisan squabbling in Congress , the investigative subcommittee of the House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Speaker . Soon after , the full 10-member committee seconded the decision . Of the four new charges they decided to pursue , the most serious one asks whether the Speaker gave investigators " accurate , reliable and complete information "  --  meaning , did he lie to them ?  --  about the tangled links between his videotaped college course , the tax-exempt foundation that developed it , and GOPAC , his political operation . The questions boil down to whether he used tax-exempt donations to support a political undertaking . Although Gingrich insists the charges are groundless , the action guaranteed that the case will dog him beyond the election , whether or not he returns as Speaker . <P>  --  By Karen Tumulty
