Roughly half the ceiling at the National Restaurant Association 's headquarters in Washington has been torn out to make way for a new sprinkler system . Though unintentional , it 's a fitting symbol of President Clinton 's proposal to install a 50% ceiling on the deductibility of business meals . Unfortunately , nobody at this 75-year-old trade association is in the mood for irony . " If the government keeps going the way it is , you wo n't have any fine- dining establishments in America , " grumbles chief executive William Fisher , as he chows down a power lunch at nearby Mo Sussman 's restaurant . " We are not a special interest . And I do n't wear Gucci loafers . But what 's good for our industry is good for the economy . " <P> While most anti-Clinton lobbying groups are lying low ( for now ) , the proposed bite on business meals is sparking a four-star effort by the restaurant association , which boasts a $21 million budget and one of the largest industry PACs in the nation . It will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to find politicians willing to stand tall for $50 lunches . But a week before Clinton even announced his plans , the group persuaded Congresswoman Barbara Vucanovich of Nevada , where expense accounts run wild , to sponsor a bill that would re-establish 100% deductibility . Hours before the President 's speech , angry restaurant lobbyists were telephoning Congress . <P> The industry points out that up to 30% of its $225 billion in receipts comes from deductible business meals . In the early 1980s , power lunches were 100% deductible . The Tax Reform Act of 1986 sliced that to 80% . " What 's going to happen in five years ? " asks Fisher , who adds facetiously , " Why not just knock it out completely and knock out the country 's leading retail employer ? " <P> But the dire warnings about the potential death of this market are not exactly bolstered by the restaurant association 's own studies . In 1986 it released a report claiming that the 20% decline in deductibility would prompt a 6% drop in annual sales and job losses of more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argument went , any gains to the Treasury would be more than offset by lost revenue from income and sales taxes . <P> In reality , nobody except the dead stopped eating . Restaurant employment jumped from 8 million in 1985 to more than 9 million today . Table-service revenues actually jumped in 1986  --  the year of the tax act  --  and they grew more than 6% a year until 1989 , when the recession prompted a dip . In 1992 sales began to rebound . Of course , high-ticket restaurants in particular have taken a beating , but that probably has more to do with a general post-1980s decline in lavish spending than it does with the deductibility of meals . <P> Even so , doom-and-gloom media stories are popping up everywhere . A week ago , the Boston Globe described its state 's restaurant business as " limping through the past few years , when about one in every five establishments closed their doors , " according to the Massachusetts Restaurant Association , which is affiliated with the national group .
