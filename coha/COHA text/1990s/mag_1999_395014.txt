Section : PESTICIDES/REPORT We analyzed pesticide levels in 27,000 fruit and vegetable samples . Many are too high <p> The government and agribusiness boast that the U.S. food supply is the " safest in the world , " but it is surprisingly easy for children to eat fresh fruits and vegetables with unacceptable levels of some especially toxic pesticides . <p> In a first-of-its-kind study of Department of Agriculture data , Consumers Union analyzed not only the amounts of pesticides on produce but also how toxic those pesticides are . The results suggest that what you choose to eat can make a real difference in the amount of toxic residues you consume . <p> The findings are especially pertinent to children , who eat far more produce per pound of body weight than adults and who are more sensitive to some effects of pesticides . With some fruits and vegetables , kids who eat a single serving can exceed the safe daily limit of certain pesticides . Other highlights : There are vast differences in the pesticide residues that different fresh foods contain . In general , processed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table below ) . The pesticides on virtually all tested produce are within legal limits . But many of those limits are at odds with what the government now deems safe for young children . Just one widely used insecticide , methyl parathion , accounts for the lion 's share of the total toxicity of the foods we analyzed . Its use is increasing on some crops , such as green beans , despite the availability of effective , less toxic alternatives . Domestic produce had more , or more toxic , pesticides than imported produce in two-thirds of the cases . DDT and other pesticides banned decades ago still linger in soil and show up regularly in residue tests . <p> The findings suggest that parents might want to be careful about the types and amounts of fruits and vegetables they serve their children - while still making sure they get plenty of healthful produce . While peeling can greatly reduce pesticide residues on many fruits and vegetables , it ca n't eliminate them . <p> At the moment , federal regulators are in the midst of taking a new , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a landmark 1996 food-safety law . Our findings suggest they should focus on the few specific pesticide uses that contribute a disproportionate share of the toxicity of residues in our food supply . How toxic ? <p> Our study is based on a treasure trove of data collected by the Department of Agriculture . Every year , the USDA checks the types and amounts of pesticides in thousands of samples of fruits , vegetables , and a few other products - domestic and imported , fresh and processed . The foods selected vary from year to year , but most have one thing in common : Young children eat a lot of them . Before testing , samples are prepared as they would be at home : Oranges and bananas are peeled , apples and peaches are rinsed , and so forth . The information is the most comprehensive the government collects on the pesticide residues people are actually ingesting . <p> We analyzed the results of the testing done between 1994 and 1997 on 27 food categories , covering some 27,000 samples ( a sample is about five pounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pesticides can be thousands of times more toxic than others . When it comes to pesticides on foods , the biggest concern is a person 's long-term exposure . Many compounds may affect the developing nervous system . Some are suspected of causing cancer . Some may interfere with endocrine activity . For our analysis , we devised a toxicity index that integrates all of these health risks and reflects the actual amounts of pesticides detected on produce . Highest scores <p> Of the 27 foods the USDA tested in the four years we analyzed , seven - apples , grapes , green beans , peaches , pears , spinach , and winter squash - stand out as having a toxicity score up to hundreds of times higher than the rest . <p> In part , this is because farmers use more pesticides on these crops . For instance , the USDA tests detected 37 different chemicals on its samples of apples - a crop with numerous pests and high cosmetic standards - compared with only 10 on broccoli . <p> Also , the crops with a high toxicity score are typically treated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Other foods had a very low score . These include apple juice , bananas , broccoli , canned peaches , milk , orange juice , and canned or frozen peas and sweet corn . The pesticides found in these products are either less toxic , used in much smaller quantities , applied longer before harvest , or removed or destroyed during peeling or processing . <p> A high toxicity score does n't automatically mean a food is unsafe to eat . Your personal risk depends on your age , your susceptibility to the effects of a compound , how often you eat a particular food , and how much of it you eat relative to your body size . <p> But the differences in toxicity scores do matter . For foods with the highest scores , even an adult can ingest pesticide residues that exceed what the government deems safe . We consider a score of 100 or more of concern ( a variation of 20 points or less is n't meaningful ) . In general , the lower the score , the lower the overall long-term risk . Problem pesticides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of insecticides ( see table below ) . Three chemicals stood out as problems : <p> Methyl parathion . One of the most potent members of a family of insecticides known as organophosphates , it accounted for almost all of the toxicity score of domestic peaches and frozen green beans and much of the toxicity score for apples and pears . <p> " Organophosphates are all designed to be neurological poisons , " explains Dr. Philip Landrigan , chairman of the department of community and preventative medicine at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York . " They work fundamentally the same in humans as in insects . " <p> In late 1998 the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) , which regulates pesticides , released a preliminary risk assessment of methyl parathion that concluded it posed an " unacceptable risk " as currently allowed to be used . <p> Children are being exposed to unacceptable levels of the chemical , our study found . In 1996 , the last year fresh peaches were tested , two in five U.S.-grown peach samples contained methyl parathion . Residue levels were so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe daily limit for a 44-pound child - the average 5-year-old . <p> National figures show that farmers are now using less methyl parathion on peaches than they did in 1996 , but they 're using more on apples and green beans . <p> Dieldrin . This carcinogenic pesticide was taken off the market in 1974 . But it continues to pose as much risk as many chemicals still in use because it takes decades to disappear from the soil . <p> In 1997 , the only year the USDA tested winter squash , dieldrin showed up in three-quarters of the frozen squash samples . Two-thirds of the positive samples had enough dieldrin per individual serving to exceed the safe daily limit for a young child . In all , the odds are 77 percent that a serving has too much of some pesticide . <p> Dieldrin , unlike methyl parathion , is absorbed into the pulp of the vegetable rather than being concentrated on or near the skin . That makes it impossible to wash off . Crops especially prone to absorb dieldrin include root vegetables and members of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cucumbers . Farmers can avoid the problem by not planting these crops in soil contaminated with dieldrin . <p> Aldicarb . Of all pesticides currently in use , it 's the most acutely toxic . Growers stopped using aldicarb in 1990 , but some potato growers in Washington state and Idaho resumed in 1996 . And use is increasing . <p> The USDA found aldicarb in about 6 percent of the potatoes it tested in 1997 . Because of the potential for immediate toxic effects , the agency tested 160 individual potatoes from these positive samples . About 1 in 20 had more than the safe limit for a young child . <p> Like dieldrin , aldicarb permeates produce and ca n't be washed off . Protecting children <p> How can some foods consistently exceed safe limits of pesticides when the USDA tests found almost no samples with more of any chemical residue than the law allows ? <p> One answer is that current residue limits are based on outdated standards not specifically designed to protect children , given the way their bodies process the chemicals and the amounts and types @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different from those of adults . One-year-olds , for instance , eat three times as many fresh peaches , per pound of body weight , as adults , and more than four times as many apples , bananas , and pears . All this means it 's easier for children to ingest relatively large amounts of pesticides . <p> For instance , the USDA tests found that some apples contained as much as 10 micrograms of a popular organo phosphate pesticide called chlorpyrifos . A 154-pound adult eating such an apple would ingest only half of the current safe daily dose , whereas it would put a 44-pound child 67 percent over his or her safe limit . <p> And there 's growing evidence that children are far more sensitive than adults to the effects of pesticides because their nervous systems are changing and developing so rapidly . <p> This is n't recent news ; in 1993 , a committee of experts from the National Academy of Sciences issued a major report on pesticides in children 's diets , which recommended that U.S. pesticide laws be overhauled to make foods safer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data suggest that low-level exposure to organophosphate pesticides " may have subtle , but measurable effects on neurologic function " in children . New legislation <p> That report triggered landmark legislation , the Food Quality Protection Act , passed unanimously by Congress in 1996 . It requires the EPA to take a careful look at all pesticides and tighten exposure limits to make them safer for young children . <p> The agency has already lowered its estimates of the safe daily limit for 19 of some 40 organophosphate pesticides , including methyl parathion and chlorpyrifos . ( But the residue limits on foods do n't yet reflect this change - which is another reason almost all peach samples with methyl parathion residues exceeded the estimated safe daily intake per serving for young children . ) <p> By August , the EPA must decide whether to further restrict or ban certain pesticides , including all the organophosphates . It can outlaw specific applications of a pesticide to a food or reduce the residues allowed to remain on foods . It can also increase the required interval between spraying and harvest , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Domestic vs. imported <p> The manufacturers of chemicals and the farmers who use them , fearing unfair foreign competition , frequently argue that the government should n't overly restrict pesticides . <p> Writing on behalf of the American Farm Bureau for its web site , W.E . Spencer , an Arizona citrus farmer , predicted that if the government restricts pesticides too much , " The United States - similar to its dependence on foreign oil - will have to rely on foreign producers using pesticides banned in this country to stock the produce bins and grocery aisles at the local supermarket . " <p> This scenario is n't likely . Imported produce must comply with U.S. regulations on allowable levels of pesticide residues . And federal regulators are unlikely to prevent American growers from using pesticides , provided they do n't leave unacceptably high residues on foods . <p> In the USDA database for 1994 to 1997 , there were 39 cases where enough foreign produce was tested to allow for a meaningful comparison with its domestic counterpart . In 26 of those comparisons , the toxicity score of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 10 times higher . In fact , of the crops with the highest toxicity scores , U.S. produce almost always outscored its imported counterpart . Recommendations <p> Based on our analysis , Consumers Union has asked the EPA to restrict or ban specific pesticide uses that expose children to residues above safe limits . <p> For virtually all of these uses , there are less toxic ways of controlling pests . But switching will be difficult , and perhaps costly , for farmers long accustomed to using certain chemicals on their crops . The government should provide financial and educational support for this transition . It should also direct more research toward finding safer ways of managing pests now controlled by the most-toxic pesticides . <p> The USDA should sample key crops periodically to track trends . Ideally , it would also increase the number of foods tested each year . <p> For consumers , there are several ways to minimize exposure to pesticides . One thing you should not do is stop serving fresh produce , which provides a host of vital nutrients . Instead , consider taking these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the highest toxicity scores . Peel those foods with a high toxicity score , such as apples , peaches , and pears . That usually removes much of the toxic residue . Washing with very diluted dishwashing detergent also helps . Consider buying organically grown produce , which is increasingly available . When we tested organic fruits and vegetables ( see our January 1998 report " Greener Greens ? " ) , we found that they had few or no toxic pesticide residues . For More Information <p> Our study , " Do You Know What You 're Eating ? An Analysis of U.S. Government Data on Pesticide Residues in Foods , " is available at www.consunion.org . Your child 's odds <p> Here 's how often a 44-pound child - the average 5-year old - eating a serving of these foods gets more than the official safe daily limit of a pesticide . Foods are domestic unless noted . TABLE How they scored <p> Toxicity scores for USDA-sampled foods show that domestic produce often fared worse than imports . A score of 100 or more is worth concern ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Scores are for the most recent year sampled . TABLE <p> Each score is based on three factors : how many samples of a food contained individual pesticides and the average amount and toxicity of each pesticide . The toxicity component measures a pesticide 's acute toxicity ( the ability to cause immediate ill effects ) and chronic toxicity ( the ability to cause long-term effects with continued exposure ) . A driving force <p> Pesticide choices matter . The use of methyl parathion , a highly toxic insecticide , accounts for a large part of the toxicity score for some produce . TABLE <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : The odds are two in five that a young child who eats a U.S. peach will get too much of the toxic pesticide methyl parathion . <p> ILLUSTRATIONS <p> WHAT POPEYE DID N'T KNOW <p> Spinach is a persnickety vegetable to grow . " You have to protect the whole leafy substance of the plant from attack , " says Tim Hartz , extension specialist on vegetable crops at the University of California . " And the market demands a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to grow a spinach plant to maturity in your home garden that does n't have some holes in it ? " <p> The crop 's unusually short growing season means that pesticides may not have a chance to break down before harvest . All this can create toxicity problems . <p> And problems there are . In our analysis of USDA pesticide data , the single sample with the most different pesticides on it - 14 - was of spinach . Overall , the toxicity scores for spinach were among the highest we calculated , for both imported and U.S.-grown produce . <p> One in 13 spinach samples had pesticide residues that were over the safe daily limit for a 44-pound child eating a single serving . <p> The USDA tests also found more illegal pesticides on spinach - 15 in all - than on any other crop . In all , 12.5 percent of spinach samples had illegal residues in 1997 , down from 24 percent in 1996 . Virtually all of the violations were for pesticides that are approved for use on some crops , but not on spinach . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but " We did n't consider the residues high enough for spinach not to be safe to eat , " says agency spokeswoman Judy Foulke . The agency concluded that the chemicals had likely gotten onto the spinach inadvertently rather than having been applied deliberately . <p> All of which suggests that , with leafy green vegetables especially , you should wash leaves thoroughly in water or very diluted dishwashing detergent before you eat them . Or consider buying organic . <p> ILLUSTRATION <p>
