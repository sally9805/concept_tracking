Five months ago , Clayton Williams , Republican candidate for Governor of Texas , took a pledge : " No more mud . " His Democratic rival , state treasurer Ann Richards , said amen to the goal of a clean campaign . Those good intentions lasted no longer than a firefly 's twinkle . No sooner had the vows been made than both candidates began hurling misleading accusations , tossing insults and making absurd pledges of no new taxes in a state facing a budget deficit of at least $3 billion . <P> Instead of suggesting how Texas can devise a court-ordered overhaul of its school-financing system , Williams ' forces have bombarded the electorate with commercials linking Richards to lesbianism and liberalism . In lieu of proposing ways for the state to close the budget deficit , Richards blasted the airwaves with poorly substantiated spots suggesting that Williams is a " deadbeat " guilty of shady business deals . With feigned humor , Williams wondered aloud whether Richards , who was a problem drinker until 10 years ago , is tippling again . Then , playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during a joint appearance in Dallas , " I 'm here to call you a liar today . " <P> Whether amused or appalled by the name calling , Texans are not surprised . " Dirtiness has been a Texas tradition , " says Republican consultant John Weaver . " It 's a blood sport . " While the candidates have been slashing with equal vigor , Williams ' ads have had far more visibility because he has outspent Richards $17 million to $11 million . A self-made success in oil and ranching , Williams threw $6.5 million of his own into the pot . Yet last week a Gallup poll showed that his lead of 10 points had diminished to 5 since September . The survey indicated that Williams has slipped to 45% while Richards was holding steady at 40% . <P> Though the unedifying Williams-Richards race has set this year 's standard for low-blow electioneering , questioning an opponent 's honesty is a favorite tactic in states far more genteel . One reason : knocking a rival 's character is easier  --  and more fun  --  than taking stands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : it can differentiate a candidate from a foe in races where there are few significant policy disagreements . Says Bob Stein , a Rice University political scientist : " Who can explain school finance to voters in a TV ad or even a special program ? The issues have become too complex to resolve in a campaign . Voters are looking for the best person and the best mind to do the job . " <P> Thus character has become the central issue in Minnesota , where Republican Jon Grunseth is trying to unseat Democratic Governor Rudy Perpich . Earlier this month , two women came forth with affidavits charging that Grunseth had encouraged them to remove their bathing suits and skinny-dip with him at his backyard pool at a July Fourth party in 1981 . The women were 13 and 14 at the time . Insisting that the event never occurred , Grunseth called Perpich a " supreme liar " for denying that he had put the women up to making the charge .                @ @ @ @ @
