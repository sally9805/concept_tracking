" ' Fade started , " he writes , " when I actually sat for awhile in the Polo Lounge at the Beverly Hills Hotel . I was with a couple of writer friends and we were headed for a party . I was dressed in a tux shirt and bow tie , just for fun . At a table across from us , one of the most beautiful young women l have ever seen was sitting with several older men . She was either a model or an actress or both . . . . She gave me the eye and she smiled at me in an alluring fashion . l do n't know if she thought I was a producer , or honestly liked my looks , but it really did n't matter . I thought I 'd died and gone to heaven She smiled at me on the way out , and started this story in my fantasies . <p> " LA , of course , had been working on my nightmares long before . " <p> The thousands of houses papered across the basin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The gray film of smog . The Pacific beyond , sun bright with faded promise . He was approaching LA , now . He was excited . <p> The smacking of rubber on concrete sent a jolt up his spine . Anticipation and claustrophobia made him snap his seatbelt and sit on seat edge as the DC-10 taxied to the USAir terminal . The engagement with the loading dock seemed to take forever . When he finally got off , after the press of bodies squeezing into the aisle , the dry feel of the sunny air touched him , relieving him of that last bit of Minneapolis winter chill . ( Seventy-nine degrees , the pilot had announced . Seventy-nine degrees sitting on the brilliant freeways , the swaybacked palms . ) He finally relaxed enough to allow himself the possibility this was n't a dream , this was real . <p> A big movie studio was going to make a movie out of one of his books and he was going to write the screenplay . <p> Well , the first draft , anyway . He knew enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expecting the finished project to be his vision . It was like Raymond Chandler said when asked if he thought that Hollywood ruined his books . Of course not , he 'd say  --  there they are right there on the shelf , just the way I want them . <p> There was a guy in tennis shoes and an Angels baseball cap with a sign that read DENNIS MACKE , holding it so the people who disembarked could read it . Sunglasses , too . Chewing gum . <p> " Hi , that 's me . " <p> " Hey . Welcome . " Easy handshake . " You got luggage ? " <p> He had luggage , yes . The guy took his carry-on bag , but Dennis hung on to his notebook computer . He 'd done a little work on the new book on the plane and hoped to do more in LA . They went down to the first level , snagged the luggage , showed the baggage tickets to the lady by the exit and trundled the cart on out to the car . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself a drink , watch MTV , whatever . " The driver 's name was Gary . " They must like this book of yours , huh ? " <p> " Yes . They paid me much more than I got for it from Random House . " <p> " Great . " The luggage got tossed in the back and the driver grinned . " I got a screenplay . Maybe we can make a book out of it . " <p> The traffic was awful and so was the screenplay , but by the time the limo pulled up to the Beverly Hills Hotel and Gary the driver ticked off all the things he could procure for him , Dennis decided to give him the benefit of the doubt and promised to read the whole thing in his room . <p> He 'd never been to LA before , so the blasting green of Beverly Hills and the voluptuous pink of the hotel made him giddy and grinny . The bellhop took him to his suite , popped his champagne cork and promised a primo table at the Polo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Century Lion was paying for everything . Say , you know , I write too . . . . <p> With another screenplay reading promised , the bubbles of the Brut tingling his nostrils , Dennis sat on his balcony overlooking a pool of bikinis and he breathed in this magisterial city of sun and success . There were strange aromas in the air , flower smells foreign to him . Laughter tinkled somewhere like bells and there was a plume of exhaust and burn of rubber as a Ferrari rammed from the parking lot into the hard gleam of the rolling city . <p> The phone rang . It was the studio , was he okay , was he up for that meeting tomorrow , no problem to take an extra day to relax first by the pool . No , he said . Tomorrow was okay . Tickets to a show ? No problem . You 've got the limo tonight or maybe you 'd like us to rent you a Beamer . <p> He took the BMW since the limo made him feel really strange . A Swedish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his hands , the freedom of solitude with which to cruise the foreign streets . He took the two tickets for the show at the Henry Fonda Theater . A comedy with a couple of movie stars dabbling in the stage . Would Friday night 's performance be okay ? Great , just great  --  and we can get you a date too , if you 'd like . Male or female ? Female , please . We 've got a secretary down here dying to see that play and loved your books . She 's a knockout . You 'll have fun . <p> And Dennis said he felt fine , that tomorrow 's meeting was still okay and that he was really looking forward to it . <p> Super , said the Exec . Wash up , relax , enjoy . The limo will be waiting for you at eleven tomorrow morning . Welcome to Los Angeles ! <p> He took a long shower , changed into something fresh and colorful and appropriate and went down to that table at the Polo Lounge . When he gave his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a big smile and he was seated at a small empty table . A waiter elbowed through the tinkling jazz piano almost immediately and took his order for a **29;880;TOOLONG . The drink came to him perfect , fresh and delightful , three big California olives skewered on a stick resting in the glass . <p> Through the windows and the touch of gin , he looked out on the palms and the flowers and thought : the light , the smells , the sounds  --  it 's all different here . Beautiful and charming . <p> Since he was alone , he could not help but notice the Conversation in the booth adjacent from him . Not complete sentences , just snatches of words . . . <p> "  --  photoshoot  --  " <p> "  --  Q rating  --  " <p> "  --  cover story  --  " <p> "  --  entertainment  --  " <p> They were like notes of music , hanging in the air , implying some unheard but fabulous symphony . Sitting across from him , a wing of hair over one eye like a young Veronica @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dennis had ever seen . She had on a tight dress that spoke of perfect curves and although he could not smell her perfume , one look at her perfect face synthesized it in his mind : a pheromone phenomenon . Next to her was an older man . His stubby fingers were spread on her thigh like a squashed bug as he spoke to the other people at the table . From time to time the woman 's eyes would drift across the room . Halfway through his martini , she caught him staring at her . She smiled . <p> He finished the drink in a gulp and ordered another . <p> "  --  antediluvian  --  " <p> "  --  locus of fusion points  --  " <p> "  --  referential gnosis  --  " <p> "  --  tangential trajectory  --  " <p> Startled , he looked up from his bleary examination of the pimentos in his olives . The same voice next to him , but were those words correct ? Surely not  --  <p> He got up to use the men 's room , and shot a brief glance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nondescript sorts , three men and a woman , no ties , a dress , a clatch of drinks in the field before them . Laughter . . . . <p> A flicker of something in the shadows between them . Had it been a cane ? It looked wooden . . . but it was too angled and barbed to be a cane . Chitinous was the better word , actually , thought Dennis . Barbed . <p> He used the bathroom , and when he got back , the beautiful woman was gone . Disappointed , he sat down , only to find a triply folded napkin under his drink . <p> " Hi , " the note read . " I 'm in Room 2556 . Can I buy you a nightcap at eleven o'clock ?  --  The Girl by the Squalid Old Slug . " <p> Dennis Macke 's heart hammered in his chest . <p> At eleven o'clock Dennis knocked on the door of Room Number 2556 of the Beverly Hills Hotel . <p> His heart was beating hard again , and his head was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then he 'd called his girlfriend back home . Jeanne had wanted to come , but her mother was ill and there was no one else to take care of her . Jeanne had cried and nagged and had been a general pain , and so he had assured her he 'd be back by the weekend and everything would be fine . <p> By the time he got around to thinking about dinner and a cruise around Hollywood , he was far too head-numb to drive , and so he 'd called up the limo . Gary the driver took him up Sunset , got him a Spago pizza take-out , cruised along the strip pointing out the nightlife . Rock clubs , strip clubs , jazz clubs . Neon , neon , neon . They took in the early show at the Comedy Club together , then they stopped at Tower Records , where Gary bought some new CDs for himself while Dennis bought a newspaper , some magazines , and the new book of essays by A.S . Byatt . <p> All through the gentle palmy-balmy night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nebulous emptiness and ephemeral colors , Dennis thought about the girl who 'd left the note . He checked his watch constantly . He did not want to be late . Gary asked if he wanted a girl for the night , but Dennis refused . No , he had a date at 11:00 PM . Had he not had that date , though , he would not have taken Gary 's offer anyway . It was n't so much Jeanne , or fear of STDs or whatever else as it was a low-level sense of off-kilter-ness , out-of-balance , wrongness he felt seeping through the cracks of the limo from the LA night . <p> He loved it . It scared him to death . There was a sharp beauty about everything , but he sensed another sharpness beneath  --  the unforgiving edges of hidden razors . Purely intuitive . Everything else was sensually alive and electric , like it was all one huge environmental manque , plugged into a never-ending power supply . <p> Gary got him back at 10:45 . He 'd washed his face , brushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into giddy uncertainty . <p> Knock knock . <p> " Just a minute , " came a crystalline voice , female , melodious . There was a promise in it , like the promise of a naked woman , posed  --  and yet an unnecessary promise . The beauty was sufficient in itself . <p> Dennis stepped back , adjusted himself . <p> The door opened and she leaned a smile out . <p> " Hi . Thanks for coming . I 'm Hillary . " <p> She was scrubbed bright . She wore a little bit of makeup and she smelled exactly as he imagined , only inexpressibly fresher . <p> " Dennis . " He cleared his throat , feeling his words clunked up in disorder at the top of his throat . " Uhm . . . " <p> She gave him her hand and she laughed . She was wearing blue jeans and a crisp white blouse . Bright blue bracelets and earrings tinkled with her laughter . <p> " You 're not from LA , are you ? " she said , twinkle-eyed . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , drinking a martini , looking extremely out of place . Just so cute . Like Woody in Cheers . Come in , Dennis , I wo n't bite . " <p> He entered and she closed the door behind her . <p> " I 'm afraid I do n't have any martinis , but I 've some very nice White Zinfandel . " She pointed to a bucket of ice with an uncorked bottle sticking up from it . " Napa Valley . " <p> " Sure , that would be fine . " He clasped his hands behind him so they would n't fumble at his belt buckle like they tended to , betraying midwestern hick nervousness . God , such clusters of diamond words he could string together in his prose with , ah ! bright gleams  --  and yet when his endocrine system was chugging , he could n't talk worth a damn . <p> She went to the bucket . " You must think me awfully brazen . I hope you do n't think I 'm common . " <p> " Actually , your note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't so bad ! " But you seemed to have company . " <p> " Hmm ? Oh that was just my agent  --  he 's married and I do n't touch married men  --  I just let them touch me a little . " She poured the wine into two elegant glasses . " You 're not married , are you ? " <p> " No . " <p> " I did n't think so . No ring but a definite ring quality to your face . Here you go . Cheers and all that . " <p> She handed him the glass of wine , invited him to sit down . <p> " Not that we 're going to touch or anything , necessarily , " she said after a contemplative sip . " I needed company tonight and you looked trustworthy . Was I right , Dennis ? " <p> He was staring at his wine , wondering if he should be disappointed or not . Then again , if she 'd answered the door wearing nothing but a towel he 'd probably have run away . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " It 's pink ! " <p> " Well , of course it 's pink . . . It 's White Zin . . . " That tinkling hugh again . " Oh , of course ! Yes , actually it 's more of a blush . " <p> " It tastes wonderful . " <p> " I thought you 'd like it . Now  --  me , I 'm a model and they 're after me to act . I 've been here lots . I 'm living in Manhattan , but I 'm from Iowa . Went to Iowa U. " <p> " Iowa City . " <p> " Yes . " <p> " Great writing program there . " <p> " You 're a writer . . . I thought you looked like a writer . " <p> " Not full time , until recently . I teach high school English in Minnesota  --  I 've written a few books . Tender Plains is one . River Grass is another . " Her look was blank . She 'd never heard of either one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . kind of a saga thing about Scandinavians coming to settle America and their story through the World Wars . " Face still blank . Charming , but empty . Tabula rasa . " It 's called Streams of Time . " <p> That face brightened intensely . " Yes ! " <p> " You 've heard of it ? But it has n't been published yet ! " <p> " But it 's been bought . By Twentieth Century Lion , right ? That 's why you 're here ! " Upon the face now were writ tomes of unreadable eagerness and impression . " Oh , how marvelous . How utterly wonderful . You must be terribly excited . " <p> " Yes , thank you  --  but it 's all very new . " <p> " You know , I had a hunch  --  A hunch ! My instincts are quite golden , you know . That 's why I knew I could leave you that note . Your expression was just so open  --  so , well , I do n't want to say totally innocent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He regretted it immediately , but did n't know what else to say . It seemed to be just the right word , though , because she laughed again in her sweet way , and she touched him on the arm . <p> She said , " Let me get my sweater . Let 's go out . Let 's have some fun . " <p> She had a rented Jaguar and she ripped it through the night , laughing . They tore down Rodeo Drive and she gestured at the expensive stores where she bought her " work clothes , " as she called them . She angled up Santa Monica Boulevardonto Hollywood . <p> She roared past Hollywood and Vine . <p> " Dismal , huh ? " she said , her scarf blowing in the wind . " And right along here is Walk of Fame . How 'd you like to strive for glamour and success all your life , and then have your name trod on by whores and pimps and sweaty tourists for eternity ? " <p> " I do n't think I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , probably not . It still gives me the shivers , though . " <p> She stopped outside the Mann Chinese theater and showed how much bigger her feet were than Marilyn Monroe 's . His dwarfed Clark Gable 's . He was amazed at how squalid and petty it all looked . Impressions in grainy concrete by souvenir stands . <p> A crowd was let out of one of the theaters as they inspected the glamorous memorabilia . They shambled out to their cars , and their voices from a distance seemed in foreign languages . <p> Afterward , they walked across the street to the Roosevelt Hotel . On the second floor , above the lobby , stretched an exhibit of old photographs of Hollywood 's past . Hillary showed him a photo of the Hollywood sign when it read HOLLYWOODLAND . The placard said that the area used to be a real estate development of the early twentieth century . <p> There was also a picture of early settlers in the area in the late nineteenth century . <p> " Mars , " said Dennis . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settling Mars , not a part of California . " He had to trot out some knowledge , so that he would n't seem the total ignoramus . " I mean , it was a desert back there , before they had any water . " <p> " Oh . Yes , that 's right , " she said . <p> After walking through the exhibit , she charmed a waiter downstairs at the CINEGRILL to let them watch the last part of a jazz show . He ordered glasses of White Zinfandel . She held his hand as the saxophonist played a tribute to Stan Getz as a finale . <p> They buzzed back and he walked her to her door . <p> " What 's your room number ? " <p> He gave it to her . <p> " Maybe I 'll give you a call tomorrow . " She kissed him on the cheek , and then left him outside . He walked back to his room feeling ebullient and light-headed . His walk back to his room took him past the Polo Lounge . Shadows moved beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a subtonal language that could have been English or Swahili . <p> The next day , when Gary knocked on his door , he was up , breakfasted , and ready for his meeting . As they trundled onto the freeway toward the San Fernando Valley where Twentieth Century Lion was , Gary asked him how he 'd done with the girl . <p> " Might have another date tonight , " said Dennis , letting it go at that , along with a satisfied smile . <p> " Be needing me ? " <p> " No . She has a car . " <p> " I 'll be on call anyway . I 'd like to get a look at this babe . " <p> " How do I know I can trust you not to steal her away from me ? " <p> " Out here ? Trust . . . ? " It was Gary 's turn to grin back in the rear view mirror . " You can trust us all in LA , babe ! " <p> The limo wheeled through the Cahuenga Pass and zipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lion was a wide lot quite close to the NBC studios , and it looked to Dennis like a jumble of World War II barracks with a fresh coat of paint . It all had a ramshackle feel to it  --  somehow , he 'd always thought that a Hollywood studio would look more . . . well , more glamorous . <p> A guard just waved Gary on through . Gary threaded through the twisted streets , finally stopping in front of a large , officious looking building . <p> " Just hop on up to the receptionist . She 'll tell you where to go . And do n't worry , I 'll be here to take you back to your hotel . And Dennis . . . " <p> " Yes ? " <p> " Break a leg ! " <p> It was n't a receptionist really , it was just a guy who told him which floor Henry Delgado could be found on . The receptionist of that floor  --  the eighth , the topmost  --  smiled brightly at him and told him he was expected . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the fact that so far in this building he 'd seen more suits and ties than in the entire city of Los Angeles . <p> A secretary came out , eyes wide behind blue framed glasses . " Mr. Delgado is delighted to have you in LA , Mr. Macke . Please come this way . " <p> The office was cutting edge snazzy , streamlined and immaculate . She showed him through a stained walnut door into a room . That it was a conference room was immediately apparent  --  a long teak table with coffee cups and chairs and smiles on top of suits were waiting for him . <p> The man at the head of the table got up immediately . He was wearing an expensive Italian suit . He shook Dennis 's hand and introduced himself as Henry Delgado , Executive V.P. of Lion 's Feature Film Development Division . He introduced Dennis around to the assembled men and women of Development . Dennis got lost in a flurry of names . Despite the fact that everyone acted very casually , he found himself to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realized what it was  --  part of it anyway . Even though this was plainly business , there was absolutely nothing stiff or businesslike about any of the demeanors he faced . It was all too calculatedly pleasant . They all seemed voluble people , a bright jokey attitude hanging about them as they bounced about and enthused over his novel . <p> Well , the money was real enough . And they 'd paid to bring him out here to wine and dine him  --  only the best . He forced himself to relax and let the easy-goingness pour over him as though it was just natural and normal . <p> Nonetheless , he probably could n't hide his ill-at-easeness , and they 'd probably thought that was perfectly natural . <p> " We hope you 've been enjoying yourself here in LA . " <p> " Oh yes , thank you . " <p> " Now then . Of course taking lunch is de rigueur , " said Henry Delgado . " But first let 's take a meeting ! " <p> Easy second banana laughter . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book and we intend to make a really fine movie out of it , " said Henry Delgado . " But you know , you 're the writer , and we just respect the hell out of writers , do n't we , Jim ? " <p> The man next to him shrugged . " Well , I 'm a writer , so I hope so . " <p> " We all dabble , " said Delgado . " But Dennis . . . You have a magic way with words and storytelling . Now the task before us is to take the body of work and translate it into one of the best damn movies that this country . . . hell , this world has ever seen ! " <p> Despite himself , Dennis found himself getting excited . He could n't help himself . He loved movies too . Everyone loved movies . . . they were a cultural , almost spiritual common denominator of life in the Twentieth Century . Who could resist the thrill of an engrossing tale flashed on a screen in front of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the taste of crushed ice and Coke in your mouth . He remembered his Dad taking him to his first movie  --  Pinocchio , it was . God , how he 'd loved it . Movies ! A world of mighty sight , fantastic sound . Stories , spectacle , emotion , music ! The great sweep of human invention and panache , dazzling , dazzling ! <p> " Great ! I mean , that sounds really good , Mr. Delgado . " <p> " Fine . You been treated okay here ? " <p> " Oh , sure . I 'm having a really good time . " <p> Delgado nodded . " I 've got to tell you , Dennis . That agent of yours got you a pretty good deal . Writing the first draft of the screenplay . Usually we like an experienced adaptor to get things going . " <p> " Well , I have n't got a whole lot of illusion , Mr. Delgado . It 's kind of a long book . I was actually hoping that it would be made into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Larry MacMurtry . But I guess we could just do the central part of the book . . . That would make a pretty good movie , I hope . " <p> " Scandinavians , " said Delgado , out of the blue . He picked up two pages of heavy-bond paper , stapled together . " Scandinavians , " he said thoughtfully . <p> " Well , Norwegians , to be more exact . The book , as you know , is about the history of Norwegians , settling the Midwest . " <p> Delgado licked his lips . " Hmm . Yes , I 'm a football fan . Love those Vikings . . . . But Dennis . . . Dennis , the thing is . . . well , look at it this way . There was this movie came out a couple of weeks ago . . . Quincy ? What the hell was the name of that piece of dung ? " <p> " The Settlers , sir , " piped up a voice . <p> " That 's it . The Settlers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wholesome Disney thing . Well . . . in a word it was a dud . " <p> " But I read a review about that . . . " said Dennis haltingly . " It was about post Columbian colonists . My book happens in the Nineteenth Century . " <p> " Hmmm . Right . Well , Dennis . Nothing wrong with the Nineteenth Century . But you know , we 've just had a couple of really big epic movies that were Westerns . You know , Indians , guns , bows and arrows . Noble savages . . . brave pioneers . . . Whew , it took a lot of guts for those guys to go through what they did . . . . I do n't see much motion here in this outline . So I 'm thinking . . . this great story , these great characters . . . ca n't they meet up with some Indians ? " <p> " Well . . . there were a few tribes in the . . . but the book is n't about Indians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's be politically correct . Okay , Jimmy . Make that a definite note . We want Indians in Streams of Time . " <p> Dennis blinked . <p> " And Scandinavians . . . I do n't know . " <p> " Norwegians . " <p> " Even worse . Look , any other kinds of people in this book ? Any black people ? " <p> " Well , a few I guess , but . . . " <p> " Why not a story of the struggle of black people in the area . I like that . We 've got to do a black story this year , or we 're fucked . Streams of Time would be a perfect vehicle . " <p> " Yes sir . And we 've just put Sidney Poitier under director 's contract . " <p> " Well , talk about good fortune . Note . A definite note . Black people . We want lots of black people here . . . put a lid on the Norwegians . " He took a sip of mineral water , looked out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had breakfast with the studio executive president at six-thirty this morning and you know what he said ? Two words . Child abuse . It 's hot and he wants it in a film . Stan , I forgot . . . is there child abuse in Streams of Time ? " <p> " No sir . Nothing about it in the reader 's report . " <p> " Too bad . Too bad . How about children ? " <p> " I think so . " <p> Delgado shrugged and grinned straight at Dennis . " No problem , then . They 're abused . " He turned to the scribbler . " A note . A definite note . " <p> Dennis was stunned . He 'd expected changes in the story . There had to be changes . But nothing like this . . . <p> " I really do n't think that the . . . the theme of the book would come through . " <p> The executive looked at his fellow story people . He mulled . He scratched his head . He played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'm glad you said that . I 'm a great admirer of artistic integrity . Are n't I , guys ? " <p> " He is . " <p> " Yeah . You can count on Henry . He 'll sell your book for you . " <p> " You 're looking at a year at number one hardcover . Just like Silence of the Lambs . " <p> " Or The Firm . " <p> " Or The Bible . " <p> Laughter . General air of artificial feel-goodness . <p> Henry Delgado leaned over toward Dennis . He smelled sharp and alert and hungry , like a tiger doused in Calvin Klein cologne . " You see . You 're in good hands . Trust me . . . . Your theme . . . it 's going to be underlined in solid day-glo . It 's going to shine through to countless millions of movie-goers all around the world . . . . And Mrs. Macke . . . your mom is going to be sitting in the theater afterward , sobbing with pride that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . unashamed to tell the truth . . . the way it was . . . for posterity . " <p> He leaned back and grinned . " Now tell me . . . who do you think would be best for the lead ? Dustin Hoffman or Robert DeNiro ? " <p> Good Scandinavians , both of them , thought Dennis Macke . <p> He got out of the meeting at one o'clock , when the story executives flocked out for their " idea lunches . " One of them , a faceless grinning California boy , had offered to take him out to a local watering hole and " check out the babes in for auditions , " but Dennis Macke demurred . His head was spinning . He just need to get home , lie down for a while . <p> All this sun . All this brightness . It was getting to him . He just wanted to go back to the Beverly Hills Hotel and close his thick drapes and put on the night blinders they 'd provided him and just crawl into bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the limo took him back . Gary observed that he " Had That Look . " <p> That Look ? <p> " Yeah . It 's like when you take a bite of cake and you realize it 's iced with shit ! " <p> Gary laughed in a way that was supposed to express camaraderie and **26;911;TOOLONG . Dennis just sank deeper into the limo , looking out the tinted glass as the palm trees and haze slithered by . He felt . . . he felt as though he 'd just managed to let loose a high-voltage wire that had been charging him with a perverse energy . <p> It was here in the air now , that energy . It had been in that room , crackling in the eyes of those studio executives . A manic cosmic grasping , a scrabbling of invisible pincer claws amidst a pile of garbage and jewelry . <p> When he got into the room , the first thing he did was to call his literary agent , the man who had closed the deal . He caught the man just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an impatience about him when he was in a hurry , and so Dennis kept it quick and concise . What did the contract say about his power here ? <p> What it said , Hendrik explained , was that he 'd gotten lots of money and could well afford a case of K-Y jelly to ease the pain . <p> Dennis ordered room service alcohol , closed the drapes and pulled the bedcovers over himself . <p> When she called at seven o'clock , he 'd gotten through about three snifters of brandy , but curiously was n't at all drunk . <p> " Hey . How 'd it go today ? " she said . <p> " Terrible . They want to ruin my novel . " <p> " Hey . It could be worse , " said Hillary . " Thousands of novels are published every year that they 've no desire to ruin . Tell you what . Let 's go spend some of their money on a nice dinner . . . And then I want to show you something . " <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dead and numb . <p> " It will help you understand . " <p> " Oh , I understand . It 's a power thing , is n't it ? Egomaniacs who have no powers of creativity want to stomp with jealousy on those that do . " <p> " Power ? Maybe . But it 's not really what you think . Look , there 's nothing like a thick slab of steak , a baked potato and big glass of red wine to calm the heart of a man . And I 've heard that a pretty girl helps , too . " <p> " Why are you doing this ? What are you getting out of it ? " <p> " A free dinner . Maybe I see something in you that used to be in me . Hmmm ? And then again , maybe I figure someday you might be able to help me , somehow . " <p> The truth was somehow refreshing . <p> " Okay . I 'll order up some coffee , I guess . Meet you at eight ? " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first he was afraid that she was going to take him to Morton 's , a watering hole famous for Hollywood power dinners and also for its steak . Instead , she took him to a place in Hollywood that looked not too presumptuous , but smelled quite good . <p> " No maitre d ' . Just good food , " she explained . <p> After martini cocktails , she ordered her steak very rare . He had his medium well . They ordered a bottle of California red wine , an aromatic young burgundy whose color blended perfectly with the steak juice that collected on Hillary 's plate . She ate with gusto , talking about ambition and makeup and catty people and who could do what for whom and where her friends had gone and where they had n't . She asked questions about what kind of house he 'd like , if he had a house . A house by the sea ? A house up on Mulholland maybe , riding like a castle on a cloud ? Or a big house in Brentwood or Bel Air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State ? Tennis courts were necessary wherever , she reported  --  take Steven Spielberg , for example  --  he 'd bought a whole three million dollar estate next to his Pacific Palisades complex , just to knock down a beautiful old house and build a tennis court ! <p> They drank their burgundy . Before he knew what was happening , she ordered another , and when he came out of the men 's room she surprised him with brandy snifters and dessert . <p> By the time he signed for the check , using the credit card account Twentieth Century Lion had given him , he was quite drunk and was glad that Hillary was driving him in her green Jaguar . <p> As they left , a gust of breeze caught her hair and made a wild Medusa of it , blowing her scent in his face . She laughed and grabbed his hand and her eyes sparkled mischievously in the guttering gas torches outside the restaurant . <p> " Now  --  what I wanted to show you . " <p> The valet varoomed up in the green convertible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble , and they were off , speeding through the curves of Sunset Boulevard , then onto Laurel Canyon Boulevard , up , up , past Mount Olympus ( was Valhalla next , Dennis wondered ) , past the Laurel Canyon Store where the famous and infamous had shopped , up along the curving road to the top of the Santa Monica Mountains . There the little green sportscar hung a right and powered along a dizzying set of curves , past white palaces tilting into the night , past bushes and dirt and stretches of nothing . <p> She pulled off the road so quickly that Dennis thought she 'd gone crazy and was hurling them both off a cliff . But she braked the car and they stopped and he could immediately see that it was a pull-out , a scenic view . <p> " You can see the Valley , the Cahuenga Pass and the basin from here , " she said . " It 's the very best view . " <p> Lights , lights , lights . A scatter of lights like a plankton farm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone , somehow , suspended above this ethereal majesty , and his brain seemed pumped with helium soaring even higher , tethered to his body by the thinnest of threads . <p> The next thing he knew , she was kissing him . Her hands were moving along his body like the strokes of a painter . He closed his eyes and his mind seemed to lift higher , bending bulging eyes downward to the two of them , squirming together softly . <p> His head drifted down her neck and she sighed and trilled with soft laughter . <p> " Ooh , " she said . " Oooh . Let me show you something . Let me show you something I bet they do n't do in Minnesota . " <p> He drifted back up to her lips , his bilious mind objecting , but his body accepting readily . He was vaguely aware of her left arm moving , undulating , somehow thickening . Out of the corner of his eye he saw her hand and it seemed to blur , blur against the dashboard , morphing into what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an elephant , slick with moisture , several tongues licking out hungrily . <p> Too much to drink , he thought . Too much . . . <p> Something tugged on the zipper of his pants , and then he was engulfed in sensation and the tether snapped and his brain sailed up through the sky and burst on the cruel points of the stars . <p> He opened his eyes . <p> He looked out past the edge of the precipice . The lights below and beyond seemed no longer to merely look like stars . They were stars . Fiery suns amidst rainbow planets . Comets shot by in the blackness , and in the middle of it all a maelstrom of nothingness , like the drain in Hitchcock 's Psycho pulling all matter and energy into one all puissant black hole . <p> Staring into the maw , he felt dizzy . He turned his head toward the side of the cliff and saw , to his dismay , that the cliff had steepened , that gnarled roots feathered with mist hung out like withered limbs along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an alien island , drifting through a dimensionless space , time and gravity unstuck . <p> Laughter sounded somewhere . Screeching screams . Sobs . Distant , but somehow immediate . The crimson and magenta haloing it all seemed to throb . . . <p> He closed his eyes , and he passed out again . <p> When Dennis Macke woke up , he was in bed in a dark room . After a moment of fear and disorientation , he saw that it was the room at the Beverly Hills Hotel . <p> Lying draped over a pillow next to him , fragrant with her perfume , was a piece of Hillary 's lingerie . Pinned to it was a note : LOVELY . THANKS . <p> He lay in bed for a moment , remembering all the drink , waiting for the hangover to kick in . <p> Nothing happened . He felt just fine . <p> He remembered the dream , though . It must have been a dream , right ? How could it have been anything else ? <p> He must have slept with Hillary last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner with her and the drive up to Mulholland  --  that had all been real enough . <p> But the rest ? Dennis shuddered . He went to the phone and asked room service for a pot of coffee and an Alka Seltzer . Not that he really needed the Alka Seltzer  --  it was almost like a precaution , a ritual . <p> Troubled , he drank the coffee and opened the windows . For some reason the light  --  which sheeted in now no less brightly  --  did not alarm him . Rather it soothed him , relaxed him . He had a strange desire to go and buy a bathing suit so that he could take a dip in the pool . <p> Instead , he sat on the balcony for a while , sipping coffee . Somehow during the night , he 'd acquired a cellular phone . It was on his dresser . Property of Hotel . He had n't noticed it before . He took the cellular phone out to the balcony , along with his notebook computer . He might as well work on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to before , but as far as he knew he had nothing on his schedule and so he might as well get some work in . He had just about decided that he 'd better let the screenplay of Streams go . That was what his subconscious decision had been yesterday , he realized . Somehow it did n't seem quite as important today , but he had time to mull it over anyway , right ? <p> He had fresh fruit and yogurt for breakfast under the California sun , and he was just commencing work on chapter five of his novel Rites of Winter , when there was a knock on the door . <p> He went to answer . A delivery boy gave him an envelope . He gave the delivery boy a tip and closed the door . <p> The envelope was from Twentieth Century Lion . <p> Before he could even open it , the phone rang . <p> " Hello ? " <p> An energized , self-confident voice boomed back at him . " Dennis . Delgado here . Twentieth Century Lion . You get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . just a moment ago . . . . I . . . " <p> " Good news , bad news , good news . I 've been promoted to Chief Development Executive . Had a meeting this morning with the bean counters . Our budgets are a little top heavy . Slash slash slash . Looks like we 're going to have to put epics on the back burner . Like yours . However , I was impressed with our meeting . Very impressed . I 've been working on an outline of my own awhile . It 's hot , I think , but I need a writer with some guts and soul . I think you 're my man . What do you say ? " <p> " Well , I have to look at the outline , of course . " What he was thinking though , in a mind that did n't seem quite his anymore , was about the quarter million dollars , minimum , EXTRA , this would mean . <p> " I 'd need you here for a while , we 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife or girlfriend or whatever out if you like , that 's fine . . . so : I 'm going to call your agent and make an offer . You read the outline . Lookin ' forward to working with you . " <p> The phone clicked in his ear . He took the outline out to the balcony . In the distance , he could hear the splashing at the pool , and the thrumming of high quality engines in high quality shells and the murmur of breeze through palms and cyprus . There was the gentle scent of flowers in the bright air and a non-sequitur desire for a martini suddenly hit him . <p> He settled for coffee instead . <p> The outline concerned an alien who came to Earth to drive stock cars . Arnold Schwarzenegger was mentioned as lead . This alien became friends with a young tomboy pit jockey and her younger brother ( Macauley Culkin ) . However , the alien 's nemesis ( Hulk Hogan ) finds him and decides to try to take him out in a mammoth climactic stock car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kicks of Star Wars , minuscule budget . " <p> Dennis finished it . He drank his coffee . He read it again . His agent called . <p> " Congratulations . They really like you . I ca n't handle the fine points , so I 'm setting you up with an associate out there . We 're talking a lot of money here , Dennis . " <p> He had thought that when he got the call , he would say no . Somehow , though , he found himself taking down his new Hollywood agent 's name and number . <p> Well , he thought . I can still write novels . <p> Like now . I 'm in the middle of chapter five and I know what 's happening in my book . The prose is flowing smoothly , and everything 's just fine . <p> He sat back out on the patio and picked up his notebook computer again and turned it on . <p> Above him the sun beat down and he felt a trickle of sweat slide down his cheek . <p> Not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink , topped with an umbrella . <p> He called room service . He thought about the sun and the moon and the stars and about Hillary and he found himself saving chapter five , and then calling up a blank screen . <p> Dennis Macke thought for a moment , and then typed in the first four letters of every screenplay ever written  --  and likely , he mused , hankering for that Tom Collins , of every screenplay that would ever be written . . . . <p> FADE . <p> ILLUSTRATION <p> <p> By David Bischoff <p> Dave Bischoff has published so many short stories that he no longer counts them , and a year or so ago , he passed the fifty-novel mark . He has also worked in television , and often travels between his home in Oregon and Los Angeles . <p>
