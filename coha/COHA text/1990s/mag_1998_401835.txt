Simple precautions will keep most grizzlies at bay . But what if there 's no turning back ? // SOMEWHERE IN THE NORTHERN ROCKIES , SOMETIME this fall , a group of hunters will hike back to where one of them killed an elk the evening before , to pack out the meat and horns and hide . Thinking solely about the job ahead , they will come around the last bend , or crest the last rise , and walk smack into the biggest damn bear they have ever seen in their entire lives , feeding on the elk . Any number of outcomes could occur in the next few seconds . Among the worst , according to Steven French , M.D. ( co-founder with his wife , Marilynn , of the nonprofit Yellowstone Grizzly Foundation ) , who for 15 years has studied Ursus arctos in the field to research ways of conserving them , is that one more grizzly ends up being shot by hunters who sincerely feared for their lives , whether or not their lives were truly in danger . Killing a bear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injury . What it definitely does , though , is reduce the bear population . The prime causes of grizzly mortality in the Yellowstone ecosystem in recent years have been hunter related , with critical female mortality quotas , established by the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service , being exceeded for the last three years . None of this is to suggest that bear attacks are not a real possibility , or that someone facing a charging bear is not facing real danger . It is only to point out the fact that bears suffer disproportionately from encounters with humans , particularly hunters . It is also a fact that hunters , along with fishermen , campers , and hikers , bear , as it were , most of the responsibility for causing bear attacks ; and so the responsibility for trying to prevent them must be theirs , too . BEAR , BEAR , ANYWHERE The most basic way to prevent bear attacks is to avoid encountering bears . While hikers are advised to travel in groups , talk , sing , and clang bells to alert the countryside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obviously not about to take such measures . They are , instead , going to move as quietly as possible , usually alone , and into the wind so a bear will have no inkling of their presence until they are directly on top of it . As French , a hunter himself , sees it , the single most essential skill hunters must develop to avoid encountering bears is awareness . This is the sense that a bear could be lying just over the next hill or behind the next tree or in those final 100 yards into camp at last light . Awareness is what enables a hunter , as he stalks an elk or a sheep , not to focus so exclusively on that animal that he is blind to all the signs  --  such as scat or tracks , a dip ahead in the terrain where a bear could be concealed , magpies clustered in a tree , the scent of decaying meat-that could possibly signal a bear 's presence . As essential as it is for all hunters to develop awareness , it is practically suicidal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it harder for bears to recognize them , bowhunters carry scents and use calls to lure animals in , and their only weapon is one that Indians in bear country abandoned as soon as they were able to obtain even the shoddiest trade guns . Photograph Photograph Pepper spray ( right ) is the best means of driving off a charging bear Bowhunters , concerned with stealth and concealment , are most apt to encounter a bear at close range . // The more aware a hunter is about bears , the more likely he is not only to expect their appearance anywhere at anytime but also to know about precautionary steps he can take to stay clear of them . He might know , for instance , that a rifle shot is nothing more than a dinner bell to many bears , and that a bear can arrive on the scene of a kill at once . Bugling , and other calling , can also attract bears , so a hunter should make sure he can see all around before starting to call . An aware hunter will try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as possible . If he has to hang the meat-and hide and horns-he will do so at least 10 feet off the ground , 4 feet away from the tree trunk or supporting pole , and 100 yards from any sleeping area . If he knows he 'll have to leave the dressed carcass where he shot it for any time , he 'll collect all the viscera on a plastic tarp and drag it as far from the carcass as he reasonably can before dumping the viscera off . ( He 'll also keep the guts away from any trails to prevent creating bear problems for other people . ) Before leaving the carcass , he will strip off his sweaty undershirt and tie it to the animal , the crusty human odor likely to keep most sensible bears at bay . An aware hunter , when he returns for his animal , will come in from upwind and find a spot from which he can observe the carcass at a safe distance before walking up to it . If he does find a bear on the carcass , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bear retreats ; or he may just have to wish the bear a silent bon appetit ! and quietly retreat himself . Trying to haze a grizzly off a carcass is a hardly unprecarious course of action . THE CONRONTATION Because bears are highly intelligent , temperamental wild animals , they are far from predictable ; so a hunter can be extremely aware , do everything right , and still find himself suddenly confronting a startlingly huge grizzly  --  there are no effectively small bears , of any species . In this circumstance a hunter must first make sure the bear recognizes him as a human , people not being among bears ' prey . Running or crouching are likely to draw a bear closer , to better identify what kind of animal it is seeing . A hunter partially obscured by brush should step clear , so a bear can see his complete outline , raise his arms at his sides to enlarge his image , begin speaking to the bear in a soft , calm , firm voice , and not make eye contact . Some people advocate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at " a bear , even to the point of shouting and chunking rocks at it ! Aggressive behavior may drive off sub-adult grizzlies ( if a hunter is good enough to judge age classes ) , most black bears ( although my only attempt at scaring off a sow black bear left me very far up a tree for a very long time , at night ) , and even some full-grown grizzlies . As a rule , though , trying to intimidate a mature boar or , worse , sow grizzly with cubs is like playing chicken against a Peterbilt . Better to speak softly and back slowly away . If a hunter does face a charge-and nobody really wants to hear this-he should stand his ground . ( If there happens to be a tall tree he can jump right up in , fine ; but black bears , and more grizzlies than most people imagine , climb . ) By far , most charges are bluffs , particularly if they end in a bear 's standing on its hind legs . French reports having grizzlies charge close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staying put and not running he has yet to be bitten or clawed . That being said , there are nonetheless bears that will complete an attack . French and others believe , though , that a bear will use only the force necessary to neutralize a perceived threat . Unfortunately , this force is measured in bear-units of energy : A swat that would n't seriously injure another bear can leave a human face in tatters . If an attack looks certain ( and the deterrents described in the sidebar have failed ) , a hunter should clamp his hands behind his neck and tuck up in a fetal position with elbows and knees on the ground . This should minimize injuries and restrict them to the meatier portions of the body . ( A hunter wearing a backpack or daypack should keep it on for added protection . ) A " mauling " lasts only seconds ; it just seems to go on for days . Afterward , a hunter should remain still until he is sure the bear has gone away . If an attack actually does extend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he is down and not moving , all bets are off and a hunter should fight like hell ! ( Any physical attack by a black bear should be resisted immediately . ) Nobody can truly ask anyone else even to consider the possibility of letting a bear injure him in lieu of shooting it ; but we can reconsider our perception of the " killer bear , " at least a little bit . Bears are one of the risks we accept when we choose to hunt many wilderness areas . If we wanted a wild completely free of the risk of bears , we could have that all too easily . The only problem is , it sim ply would n't be the wild anymore . <p>
