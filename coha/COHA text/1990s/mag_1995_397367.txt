What to expect : Big-company stocks will enjoy a respectable ' 95 , especially those that can increase annual earnings by 15% or more . What to do : Look for firms that dominate their industry , are expanding into new markets or can leverage a powerful brand name . According to MONEY 's forecast , fast-growing small companies figure to be the stock market 's headliners in 1995 , turning in gains that could reach well into double digits . Even so , every investor in 1995  --  and beyond  --  also needs a solid supporting cast of blue-chip growth stocks . These firms are the nimble giants of the market , typically pinnacle players in their industry . They provide liquidity , stability and , often , the kind of growth potential that only the hottest small companies can beat . For example , all seven of our top picks are expected to boost earnings by 17% or more annually for the next five years . And $5.3 billion ( in sales ) Lowe 's , our favorite blue-chip stock for 1995 , is projected to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more representative collection of these attractive blue chips than Standard &; Poor 's 500 . That 's the reason we have rated all 500 stocks in the index by their potential for strong performance in 1995 . ( The tables begin on page 52 . ) MONEY 's forecast calls for the index to gain 20% next year on the strength of modest inflation , steady corporate profit gains , stable price/earnings ratios  --  and , with the recent Republican sweep on Capitol Hill , a possible capital-gains tax cut to boot . A 10% return is not bad , by any means , but the index 's overall performance figures inevitably mask some soaring returns by individual stocks . In the 12 months to this past Nov. 1 , for example , the S &P; as a whole barely broke even , but shares of the top 10 S &P; performers  --  led by Stone Container ( $5.4 billion in sales ) , $1.6 billion computer maker Amdahl and $519 million telecommunications supplier Andrew Corp .  --  gained an average of 95% . To help you identify companies that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a detailed look at the 30 stocks of the S &P; 500 that earned our top performance rating . Then we analyzed them further , using data from Value Line and Standard &; Poor 's  --  both are New York City firms that provide detailed stock reports to individual investors  --  and canvassed dozens of brokerage analysts and mutual fund managers . The result : a list of seven blue-chip stocks that appear to have extraordinary potential in 1995 . The starting point for our analysis , including our ratings of all S &P; 500 stocks , was the Value Line Timeliness Rank , which is reported weekly in the Value Line Investment Survey ( $525 a year ; 800-833-0046 ) . The Value Line system analyzes more than 1,700 stocks , favoring those with a history of long-term earnings growth , recent strong price gains and earnings that exceed Wall Street 's expectations . Since 1980 , stocks rated 1 for timeliness by the Value Line Investment Survey have returned 18.1% annually , tops for that period among the 19 stock-picking publications followed by Mark Hulbert , editor of Hulbert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every year , it has proved especially reliable when market performance was dominated by growth stocks , as MONEY expects in 1995 . In the tables beginning on page 52 , you 'll find the 500 listed by rank , from most timely ( a score of 1 ) to least ( a score of 4 or 5 ) . We then further scrutinized the stocks that rated a 1 on the basis of their financial fundamentals . We looked for a growing return on equity  --  a sign of improving profitability  --  and a price/earnings ratio no more than 1.2 times the rate of earnings growth , which told us that the stock was still moderately priced . These data , supplied to us by Standard &; Poor 's , are available in the detailed research reports the firm offers on more than 4,600 individual companies at a cost of $9.95 each ; call 800-642-2858 . Standard &; Poor 's also measures Wall Street 's opinion about each of the stocks in the S &P; 500 , which we include in the tables under the heading " Analysts ' opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every major brokerage firm analyst toward a particular stock and translates the consensus into a score . A rating of 1.00 or more means that Wall Street overall rates the stock a buy . An opinion rating of 0.0 or less is a sell , and anything in between is a hold . Here , then , are our seven picks for the coming year , listed in order of expected return . ( Our single best idea , Lowe 's , appears above . ) Kroger ( KR ) New York Stock Exchange , $26 Projected ' 95 return : 35% With more than 1,270 supermarkets and sales of nearly $23 billion , Kroger is the nation 's largest retail grocery . But as rapidly as the Kroger chain grows , the company somehow manages to increase profits even faster . Net earnings rose a robust 85% for the first three quarters of 1994 , exceeding analysts ' projections , and same-store sales grew by 2% , double the industry 's average growth rate of 1% . In the past the stock has been vulnerable to downdrafts because of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a hostile takeover in 1988 . Since then , however , Kroger has rigorously eased its debt burden by paying off or refinancing virtually all that it owes . Since 1989 , the company has sliced its annual interest expense nearly in half , from $648 million to $331 million , partly by replacing long-term debt at interest rates of 11% to 15.5% with obligations paying less than 10% . " Because of the $3.9 billion in debt Kroger is still carrying , these shares are too volatile for widows and orphans , " says Edward Comeau , an analyst at Lehman Bros. in New York City . " But the company 's improved balance sheet means far more predictable earnings in the future . " Kroger 's shares trade at a P/E just under 11 , a 25% discount to other supermarket stocks . Comeau believes that shares could rise to $35 in 12 months . Oracle Systems ( ORCL ) NASDAQ , $46 Projected ' 95 return : 26% The world 's largest vendor of database software and services , this $2 billion Redwood Shores , Calif. company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faster than anticipated . Over the past two quarters , Oracle 's revenues have jumped 40% and earnings have zoomed an amazing 60% . Analysts say the firm is on track to maintain at least 35% annual earnings growth over the next three to five years . Fueling Oracle 's growth is the worldwide corporate switch from lumbering mainframe and midsize computers to more nimble office PCs and workstations . Dollars spent on electronic downsizing are expected to grow by more than 40% annually , as fewer than 10% of companies have so far completed the process . Oracle has a 40% share of the $5.6 billion market for the software and service expertise needed to help companies complete the transition . However , Oracle stock is n't cheap . It trades at a P/E of nearly 33 times 1995 earnings , and conservative investors should get aboard carefully . " Oracle is the kind of company to buy if you 're looking to hit a home run and can stomach the risk , " says analyst Frank Michnoff of Donaldson Lufkin B Jenrette in New York City . Even so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next 12 months . United Healthcare ( UNH ) NYSE , $52.75 Projected ' 95 return : 23% Based in Minnetonka , Minn. , $3 billion United Healthcare owns or operates HMOs in 20 major metropolitan areas with a total enrollment of more than 3 million . When you consider that only about 50 million Americans now belong to such plans ( roughly 20% of the total population ) , it 's easy to understand why analysts believe United can grow at a hefty 28% annual rate over the next five years as more and more employers switch to managed care . " Usually a growth rate that high means you 're buying a small , less stable company , " says analyst Eleanor Kerns of Alex . Brown &; Sons in Boston . " But United is an established performer with a strong track record and proven management . " The company has increased operating earnings over the past five years at a phenomenal average annual rate of 62% . The company also has $2.4 billion in cash that it could use to continue acquiring rivals . Last September , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largest health plan , GenCare Health Systems , for just over $500 million . The deal , when finalized , means that United will serve more than half the HMO customers in metropolitan St. Louis . The company 's growth strategy is to avoid states already saturated with HMOs and stick to underserved areas . United has a 25% share of the market in Georgia , for example , where only about 8% of the population is now covered by managed-care plans , compared with , say , California , where about 45% of the residents already belong . Kerns figures that as earnings grow and the risk of sweeping health-care reform all but vanishes in a Republican Congress , United shares could rise to $65 by the end of ' 95 . Mattel ( MAT ) NYSE , $29.25 Projected ' 95 return : 21% Rising from near bankruptcy a decade ago , $2.9 billion Mattel has transformed itself into the pre-eminent global toymaker . Roughly 40% of sales now come from 141 foreign countries , where revenues are growing at twice the U.S. rate of 7% . Markets whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Latin America , home to 920 million children . ( Compare that with the U.S. and Western Europe , Mattel 's biggest markets now , which total only 110 million kids . ) Additionally , a pending acquisition of Britain 's J.W. Spear , which owns the international rights to Scrabble , will boost worldwide sales in Mattel 's least developed area : board games . The company also has an enviable list of powerhouse brands , headed by Barbie , the well-dressed doll who celebrated her 35th birthday in 1994 with record sales of more than $1 billion . Mattel 's other key brands include Hot Wheels cars , Fisher-Price toys , and merchandise based on animated Disney characters such as the Lion King , expected to generate revenues approaching $100 million . " Core brands account for 80% of Mattel 's sales , which makes for a company with predictable performance , " says Barry Rothberg , an analyst at Furman Selz in New York City . He expects the toymaker 's earnings to grow 18% annually over the next three to five years . His 12-month target price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a P/E of 15 , is $35 . Microsoft ( MSFT ) WASDAQ , $63 Projected ' 95 return : 21% In the volatile technology sector , where products can become obsolete before some customers even know they exist , $4.6 billion software giant Microsoft is a paragon of consistency . In 1994 the maker of MS-DOS and Windows posted its 19th straight year of sales and earnings growth ( 24% and 25% , respectively ) , and analysts expect Microsoft to sustain 20%-plus annual earnings gains over the next five years . The Redmond , Wash. - based company 's high-quality growth does n't come cheap , however : Its P/E of 27.3 on 1995 earnings represents a 23% premium to its growth rate . Fueling growth over the next 12 months will be the introduction by June of the company 's new operating-system replacement , Windows 95 . Analysts say this should be Microsoft 's best-selling upgrade ever  --  worth more than $1 billion . By the middle of 1995 , the firm also plans to enter the burgeoning field of on-line services for business and home users ( everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billed per transaction and generate tremendous revenues . A pending $1.5 billion merger with financial-software developer Intuit should further bolster the company 's on-line capabilities . To capture market share rapidly , Microsoft plans to integrate its on-line service , called the Microsoft Network , with Windows 95 . ( Analysts estimate there will be some 30 million users of Windows 95 . ) " Microsoft should be a major player in on-line services for years to come , making the stock a great buy for long-term investors , " says Therese Murphy , an analyst at Smith Barney in San Francisco . She believes the company 's shares could hit $76 in 12 months . Pep Boys ( PBY ) NYSE , $36 Projected ' 95 return : 20% To car owners in 29 states ranging from California to Massachusetts , Manny , Moe and Jack ( the founders of the Pep Boys auto-parts and repair empire ) are as ubiquitous as Pavarotti , Domingo and Carreras . The $1.3 billion Philadelphia-based company operates some 408 stores and has plans to open nearly 75 more by the end of 1995 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first move outside the continental U.S. Analysts say these new stores can help drive the company 's earnings up as much as 30% a year over the next five years . " Buying Pep Boys now is like buying Toys R Us before it became Toys R Us , " says analyst John Casesa of Wertheim Schroder in New York City . Why ? The $160 billion annual market for auto parts and service is currently fragmented among thousands of tiny local garages , with a few specialized national chains like Midas and Jiffy Lube thrown in . The Pep Boys strategy is to consolidate market share by offering a broad range of repairs ( everything but transmission and bodywork ) at a price that is 30% to 50% less than neighborhood shops charge . To serve working families , Pep Boys centers stay open seven days a week for a total of 86 hours . Adds Casesa : " Pep Boys fills a gaping need , now that big chains like Sears and Montgomery Ward have reduced auto service . " Because auto parts and repair are Pep Boys ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the company will suffer from the corporate neglect and misjudgments that felled department stores ' auto-repair businesses . He thinks that the stock , which yields 0.4% and trades at a P/E of 22.6 , could fetch $43 by the end of 1995 .
