In the darkness of a space in limbo , the shadow of a woman appears . It is as if she has been called up from some other dimension . Gradually she begins to appear more tangible . She walks forward towards the audience as the light around her brightens . She stands for a long time before speaking , looking at the audience , as if drinking them in . GWENDOLYN You 're so beautiful . You look like great bunches of black grapes , you look like " renegade electrons searching for a core , " 1 you look like moon striped pieces of sorry , it gets to be habit . You look like . people sitting in an audience . You 're very precious to me . You came . So I feel I have to warn you that I do die in the end , so things might get a little intense . I hope you 're not afraid of excess . But I did not commit suicide . I drank myself to death , it 's different . Do n't Sylvia Plath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think I have to throw up . Nothing personal . GWENDOLYN turns to leave but sees there is no way out . The only open space is the audience . She turns again to them , fighting the desire to be sick all over everything . The feeling passes.When I used to do poetry readings , backstage I would be vomiting and retching up whole gobs of entrails and blood and old women would come and read the future no , not true . But I would vomit . A small Canadian wren shaking with fear . And then I would come onstage and something would happen . I would become taller and broader and wiser . More beautiful , more powerful , more pure.There are n't so many of us now , there used to be hundreds of thousands . You 'd see fifteen at one party . Something has thinned down the ranks of those magic women , alien creatures , some but not all dark haired with regular features and some great bead around their necks .

I still see some on the streets , disguised in smart outfits of all kinds , I want to go up to you and say , " I know and it 's all right , I wo n't tell anyone . " As GWENDOLYN reaches towards the audience , a spark of flame erupts from her handsI 'm sorry ! I did n't mean to frighten you . Damn those creative sparks.I always used to want to get shot . You know what I mean ? In the right upper arm . Right there . I wanted to grit my teeth and say , " it 's only a flesh wound . " And then save everybody anyway .

Come into my place . Mind and heart . Behind GWENDOLYN , a golden light becomes brighter and brighter , illuminating the brick walls and the high windows of a basement apartment like no one has ever seen before . There is a chair in the corner . An old trunk . Lights dance over the space.Come into my beautiful basement , and you 'll never think of mutual funds again , nor will you think of business zen.I have a genius with small spaces I 've done great things with all my other places GWENDOLYN gestures over the top of the trunk and it opens by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloth trimmed with gold , an exotic pillow , a bottle of Russian vodka and a glass.I 'll light candles on a trunkThat 's filled with iridescent junkThe trunk is covered witha wonderous cloth , sprinkled with ultraviolet mothsthe clothis sometimes a curtainbut that 's not always certain , sometimes the clothcovers pillowsthen the cloth , becomes the moth . GWENDOLYN begins decorating her apartment , the pillow is thrown on the floor , the wondrous cloth covers the trunk , the bottle and glass are placed invitingly.Come into my beautiful basementand we 'll laughAnd have fun , shoot arrows at the sun.Time for dreaming and seemingdancing like bulls teemingwith fertility and waste , come into my place.Make haste . A change begins to occur . Almost imperceptibly at first , GWENDOLYN 's face goes slack , her body becomes heavier , her movements ungainly . She gains twenty years in moments.I need a drink . Vodka , a woman 's drink . Colourless , odourless , so it almost does n't exist . GWENDOLYN pours clear vodka into a crystal glass . The glass turns purple . She upends the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass , she pulls a series of gauzy cloths on which can be seen strange writing . " Finally then do all my poems become as crazy scarvesissuing from the fingers like a coloured meshand you , magician " 2 My mind is filled with shards of ancient pottery , with bits of lapis lazuli , with cups from Mycenae my mind is filled with bullshit . Oh yes , those magic women , all through the ages , mind filled with bullshit magic women , they have that otherworldly look at least when they 're young . And they either get settled down so you never would have known they were ever like that , or they become strange and wounded and get too many cats . Like fifty . I know , I know . I do n't want to be like that any more , I 'm taking up a career in sales . GWENDOLYN pours vodka again into the crystal glass . This time it remains . Toasting the audience , she pours the vodka down her throat , like water going down a drain.And why not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it was unmagical , it tried to kill the surreal . It was hogtown , circled with slaughterhouses , a place of diligent , unimaginative commerce . But something was going on , something exploding , the hogs were squealing and squealing , the pigs were all over town . Oinking our way into a culture . And then , something changed . A breath of air , a piece of falling mortar , the smell of sulphur , and all of sudden the house I was living in was worth double what it was worth the previous month and then triple what it was worth the previous four months , and then five times what it was worth and ten times what it was worth and the ground I was walking on was suddenly worth more than gold and I looked and saw we were scattering to the corners , all the poetic piglets were running to the basement hovels of our city . Oink . The very ground had shrunk.I do n't want to be poor . I do n't like the idea of being poor . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't like light coming through the window like anyone else . How did it happen ? Did they suddenly put a circle around and we were on the outside ? The city will pay ! The city will pay , the world will pay ! For every poet forced underground , for every painter even if the paintings are stupid , for every possibly , no probably pretentious artist forced to flee , there will be payment , maybe not this year , maybe not next year , but in the fore-seeable future , all of us , all of you are paying ! Oh yes , this city is as divided as Jerusalem.I 'm sorry , I do n't mean to go over the top . It 's just that the top is so low these days , all you have to do is be standing up and you 're over it.What is it like now to be young and luminous ? Do they take you in ? You think it was hard then , back at the beginning of it all . But it was easy to be nineteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be taken in because the few there were , were so lonely . There was nothing , almost no novels almost no poems , it was a desert , and you could be Lawrence of Arabia taken in by the local Arabs , or in this case , the Protestants.There were warehouses as big as pyramids , you could hide in them . Your ancestors are hiding there . Go on . Talk to them . I 'm one of them . Make me an ancestor of this cityI thought the clock was n't ticking , I thought we were trying to find a fourth dimension and wonder of wonders the fourth dimension turned out to be stocks and bonds.Their Global reach is murder , their Global reach has no language , has no Gods . My Global reach is full of broken tongues , at least I speak them . ( Arabic ) Ana Allemt Naffi Arabi . Come out .

I do n't mean to poor-mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reputation around me like a forest green velvet cloak . The kind magic women always seem to want to wear . And I knew . I always knew I 'd get to do this thing and I have gotten to do this thing . When you change your name at the age of twelve from Wendy to Gwendolyn because Wendy is n't the name of a serious person , you know. I 'm five years old , maybe younger and there is soft rain . For some reason I 'm dressed to go to church or have gone to church and the world is holy and height-ened . I 'm alone on the street there 's a laneway or a path , no , because I can glance over and see our house , but the trees form an arch over me and drop warm rain on my new coat . I reach up and pull off a few flowers , hold them in my hand , walk down the archway like a nun , like a bride . I am dedicating myself to something and in the air is honeysuckle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am , it was to some higher force . I said , " I am your bride . " And so many times I have felt bound by that vow , times I 've thought , " What am I doing ? Why am I killing myself writing poetry ? " And I think of the silver grey of that moment , of my child self exalted with holy self-importance . Some god is there , and sacrifice , glory if anyone is watching , and the sense of doing ultimate good . Where is that bouquet of honeysuckle now when my bank account is empty and my body full of pain ? Tiny flowers , not showy really , a golden , tawny colour , a strong sweet smell and my young soul singing . GWENDOLYN 's hands begin to shake slightly . She looks at the audience as if making a decision . Then takes her bottle and glass and sits as close as she can get to them.There 's something I have to tell you . There 's a condition that happens some- times , not when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Acidosis . I never wrote anything about Metabolic Acidosis , I 'm afraid she has halitosis the body becomes so used to receiving certain fluids , that when you stop , it can create convulsions , epileptic-like seizures , heart attacks . Not from drinking , but from stopping drinking . Stopping dead . That is what is about to happen . But not yet . Poetry is breath , and sometimes the breath comes too fast and sometimes nothing at all will let it in . GWENDOLYN fights lightly for breath , then a sigh of relief . She opens a small pocket at the lip of the stage floor and places the bottle and the glass safely inside.Last night I had two green peppers for dinner . Fried . And a big bottle of vodka . And then I drank and read comics all night . The Marvel Family is so prosperous . Then around four in the morning a Jack Palance movie came on T.V.Maybe I did n't mention that I am besotted with Jack Palance ? The actor who does the one-armed push-ups ? I just love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been broken so many times and he 's gentle and fierce and he has a ranch and horses . " Body of many wings , beloved , body of many blue wings . " 3 I do n't want you to think I 'm angry . I 'm not . I love living inside this mind , it 's a constant adventure . Me and Jack Palance and the horses and the archways . They used to laugh at me reading comics . I read them long past the time when you 're supposed to stop . Wonder Woman . Wonder Woman was a suck and a slave . She never sold very many comics , but I needed her . She had a bad hair-do and a stupid skirt , the skirt looked American , like she was wearing a flag . But her mother was an Amazon , strong and proud . Amazons were created from the great cosmic maw of reborn souls . In the comic the souls look like a lot of paisley shirts in the sky . And Zeus comes down and says , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be female . " Many years pass and then all the signs are clear . A Being , a titanic energy force of great evil is chained deep beneath the island of the Amazons , and it is rising , refusing to be calmed . The date has been prophesized since the beginning of time . It is the Eve of Destruction . Wonder Woman , who is a suck and a slave , has somehow lost her lasso , but she has a helmet with plumes and breastplates , she wears the silly skirt , and carries a golden spear . GWENDOLYN stands slowly , heavily , as if being called away from the audience . But she has to go.All the Amazons are watching , because she is the chosen one . Chosen to save the universe and all the gods . Her mother does n't want her to go . The earth shakes as she enters the first cave . Many things befall . There are eyes in the dark , spears come at her from every direction , traps , the ground gives way under her feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one point everything is flame . You see beads of cartoon sweat on her face . She is looking for a monster . Then she 's in a cage . Like a shark cage , each bar is made of intellect , each bar a language , each bar an iron concept . The cage is lowered to the very centre of the earth where no one has ever gone before . And she finds herself in a nursery . It 's so sweet and pink that she is lulled into opening the door of the cage . Where is the monster ? Where is the thing that 's going to cause such destruction ? Then she sees in the corner a filthy creature sitting in its own shit . The smell is enough to make her wretch , there are no superpowers to keep her from gagging . She ca n't tell if the creature is male or female , hair covers it 's warped body , she sees long talons , catches a glimpse of fangs . But she has pity for the creature , it 's alone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tears . It 's a child ! And Wonder Woman is filled with sorrow , she reaches out to touch the matted hair . The creature grabs her ! And Wonder Woman struggles with the creature , it 's on her back , between her legs , sucking her breasts , inside her mind . She knows it is not her strength that will save her , the creature is stronger than she is . The cage of intellect is behind her the door is open , if she can get to the cage the cage will save her and the creature knows it too . Then the strangest thing happens , she starts to fall asleep . Even as the creature and its poisons burrow deeper and deeper inside her , she feels like curling up into a nice little ball , feels a warm blanket put over her , and a sweet song sung to her . ( Singing ) You 're nothing but a nothing , A nothing , a nothing.You 're nothing but a nothing . You 're not a thing at all.not a thing at allnot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't find a way for her to win . It is the creature who is stroking her long black hair . And she is sleeping , sleeping GWENDOLYN stops as she hears the sound of rain coming from the air above her.But that 's no way to sell comics ! And so what happens is , with a mighty feat of strength , courage and training , Wonder Woman throws off the creature , stabs it with her spear , runs to the cage , sees the creature is wounded but not dead , closes the door , hears the shrieks of the creature . The Eve of Destruction is put off for another thousand years . The cage rises , she goes through the caverns and tunnels , exits the final cave . She does n't know if she can walk but she does , bleeding and victorious . Her mother embraces her and a great cheer rises up from the Amazons.No one notices the shadow of the creature following behind her . Dwarfing the walls is a giant shadow , GWENDOLYN moves towards it . It is as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whirls around to face the audience , a common sense square of light appears behind her.But that 's not modern . Gods and Amazons , not modern . You have to disen gage to be modern . And what you have to do to be post-modern I 've never figured out . I wrote a book . And it 's so good . Every poem . Not a clunker in it . Boom and boom and boom and deeper and darker and lighter and funnier . There . How much is that worth ? That 's what I said to the bank manager when I asked him for a loan . There , how much is that worth ? He was under the impression I would be late for our appointment . I said , " I am always on time for deadlines , and furthermore , I 've supported myself as a poet for twenty years without a day job running IBM would be a vacation . " No , that 's not what I said , that 's what I wanted to say . I doubted . I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying hard enough . Where are your RSPs , where is your mind ? You could learn Arabic , you could learn Hebrew , you could learn Greek , ancient and modern , why could n't you get together a simple down payment for a house ? " I rallied . To show him my yield potential , I marched home and brought my twenty books , plunked them on his desk and said . " I did these , how much is this worth ? " He looked at me with these quite lovely blue watery eyes and said , " nothing . " The Truth . Truth . I kissed him on the mouth . He looked very surprised I do n't think anyone had ever done that after being turned down for a loan . I gathered together my twenty books in two shop ping bags , walked out of the bank , muttering ideas for a sequel to the Odyssey . ( Greek ) An boro na miliso ten glosa tote boro na chorepso to choro . As she speaks , GWENDOLYN gains weight , the lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She hunches over the imagined shopping bags , her eyes darting at corners.I had long since left off wearing my long velvet robes , I was dressed in a lumpy wool coat and winter gumboots . I know what people saw . GWENDOLYN straightens , shedding many years.I could do it if I wanted . All I 'd have to do is make a certain shift . And the phone would always be ringing , and my assistant would be in the other room making coffee . Herbal tea . And I am in a perfectly cut business suit . The kind magic women always like to hide behind . She answers a metaphorical telephone.Gwendolyn MacEwen , Poetry International ? I told you , I want John Cassavetes to do the film . He 's dead ?

I know that flipping between extremes is not a good idea , I know there 's a sacred little path between the two . " You have the Jekyll hand , you have the Hyde hand . " 4 My therapist was blind . They gave her to me for free . In the corner is a seeing eye dog , a beautiful German Shepherd . " We have to get to the bottom of the well . We have to go right to the pit of the pain .

You missed your appointment . Gwendolyn ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Gwendolyn ? Gwendolyn ? " In the darkness the trunk illuminates itself . GWENDOLYN walks towards the trunk like a sleepwalker , then rips off the wondrous cloth with a magician 's flourish . Beneath the cloth a square of paper appears , made of light . GWENDOLYN kneels down beside the trunk and begins slowly to write.Her mother was madand her father drank.So sad . So sad.Her mother was sadand her father She stops herself . She wipes the square of light away impatiently and starts to rhyme herself into the ground.Whatever you do , do n't write poetry.I mean it. It 's bad for your liver , it 'll make you shiver , it bloats the bladder , it sads the sadder , and bads the badder.It causes osteoporosis , it makes more hair than usualgrow out of your noses.For the females a dreaded mustache growsand that 's in addition to the hair in the nose.Fur ballscoagulate and furbulatein the small intestineDo you think .

She walks into the audience , manacles in her hands , and asks one of them to lock her up. I am going to need some help . And then I will eat a very large bowl of kelp . Actually it 's you I 'd like to tie me in chains , then maybe I can borrow some of your brains . It 's very simple , just take the lock , I 'm sorry , I just really have to stop . Do n't be afraid to snap it tight , it 's so important for me to get this right . Now the other side , I hope you do n't think I 'm taking you for a ride . That 's swell , you are helping me out of a kind of hell . Oh , that 's so much better ! I 'll have to write you a card @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stands in the middle of her audience and rattles her locks and chains.This is so good . I 'll never get out . Poets are magicians without quick wrists . Well , no more poetry for this girl . I can feel myself becoming more tangible by the moment . They 'd never let me into the fourth dimension done up like this . Think prose . Think filing . Think flossing . Think faxing . GWENDOLYN turns to reenter her apartment.I 'll go back to the bank manager as a real person in the real world The manacles suddenly drop to the ground with a giant thump . GWENDOLYN stares at them on the ground.Shit. " silent as Houdini who could escape from anythingexcept the prison of his own flesh . " 5 The light on the audience dims . As if there is no more protection.Poets love the dark . Drunken clocks , electric gardens , kindled children , strange breakfasts , rattlesnake spines Her mother was madand her father drank.so sad.Her mother was badand her father blank .

First you are wrapped in an old fashioned straight jack et , the kind they used to use for murder ous criminals . Then you are placed in a glass coffin , maybe like that guy in New York , and the coffin is placed in a water boiler , and the water boiler is placed in a tank , and the lid is nailed shut . And you know the trick , you 've done the trick a thousand times , but this time you ca n't get out . You 're looking for some image that will set you free . The air is running thin , everyone is watching , the coffin is real , and you are locked , locked in a thousand chains . Where is that image ? " Everything dies and I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But what does that mean ? What 's your dark ? Is it lurid bodies being eaten by worms ? Electrons like mad bees circling your head ? Is it germ warfare ? Going blind ? Waking up paralyzed ? Excruciating pain ? Your moth er dying ? Your child dying ? The child I never had was mad.Red and hoarse , even coarse , It was unnatural and bad.A twisted lump , with eyes that burned redAnd almost no head . So when they ask me about the child I never hadI never say , madness skips a generationI never say , what gives you consternationIs that I never had the child that was madNever . Poets love the dark . Then there 's a moment in a sunfilled kitchen , I do n't know why I say ' sunfilled ' because I lived in so many basements .

About your life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes you sick . You fight it , you do n't want to feel it . It hurts . And yet you allow yourself to sink right into your guts . Not for yourself , but for the poem . And the poem may or may not be dark , but the moment is always dark . It 's always dark to go somewhere you do n't want to go.Someone you know hangs themselves , do you imagine the rope , the body swinging , of course not unless you 're moved to write a Do you find out that at his feet were four cigarette butts ? Do you imagine him smoking them before he did it ? Do you wonder if it took a long time to die there alone in the woods ? Do you wonder if he got an erection at the last ? A big blue one .

" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughs , picks up a wand and starts blowing bubbles . She catches a bubble , which has become suddenly solid in her hand , and drops it into a secret door in the trunk . We hear the tinkle of broken glass.If I were to say to you , I 've had many lovers , I think I 'd be giving you the wrong impression . Not that I have n't had many lovers , not that I 've ever counted . But to say , I 've had many lovers is to present myself as a bit slutty maybe and it was n't like that . I 've been married more than a lot of people . Twice indeed . The first I wo n't talk about , there are too many rumours . The second I wore the veil . I took the vows . And I 'm still very connected to him . The one where I wore the veil . But in between and around what I 'm trying to say is that I lived in a world that was voluptuous . Where the meaning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my lovers . Loved them . Loved them . And they loved me . And when we made love , we were learn ing . It was the kind of thing where you could say , ' sex is my sacrament ' and no one would snicker . I 'm not saying living like this does n't have any problems . I 'm not saying there are n't children left over from that time knocking on doors , asking , " are you my mother ? " But I do believe that some things go hand in hand and when the language of this lovemaking left , something else left too.I wonder if I was a good lover . I 'd like to think so . I 'd like to think I gave some thing , that there was a weight to it . So I can say I 've had many lovers just like I can say I 've had a lot of cocks inside me and I have . There are times when I think I ca n't stand to have one more cock inside me . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say I 've had many lovers is also to say I have paid a price .

And because I knew how to play , I think maybe I was a good lover . And if things got a little tortured , things got a little tortured . We 're not sup posed to love drama , we 're supposed to love reality . I never understood that.I 've been thinking about the heart . My heart . How it pains and twitches some times . My heart is in a cage and my ribs are that cage and the bones are torqued and twisted . The idea that you 're sup posed to give your heart . Such a simple thought .

" Poetry has nothing to do with poetryPoetry is how the air goes green before thunderis the sound you make when you come andwhy you live and how you bleedand the sound you make or do n't make when you die . " 8 It 's coming back . I 've seen you as I 've walked these streets . Tiny dark rooms and bars are filled to the rafters with poets .

Too many leaping words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and alleys of the world , these poets , or they will shrivel in the septic sun . Come out . I see your eyes gleaming . Come out . Speak to me of victory .

When she pulls away , two tongues of flame are burning in the palms of her hands . " We all have second degree burnsAnd they hurt but the hurt does n't matter.The living flame of the world is what matters . " 9 The flames burn as she speaks , the sound of fire builds to a crescendo . The flames disappear . A moment of total blackness . GWENDOLYN appears suddenly in another area of the stage.It 's dangerous . I 'm not saying it 's not dangerous . The travelling is definitely dangerous .

Poetry is the fastest thing I know , but it 's not that other quickness , that dead ly speed . Once there was a woman who yearned above all things to have a brother . She thought if she had a brother , an other , a male reflection , that she would find her true self . And her fantastic loneliness would go away . She lived in a place sur rounded by doorways and each one led to an ancient spot and some to spots that had n't been invented yet .

There were doors to Minoa and doors to Mesopotamia , doors to ancient Jerusalem , and ancient Greece , and one to a place called Kanada that was so exotic you had to be very care ful when you went there . On winter nights when the loneliness got so bad she thought she would die , she would choose a door . Only in Egypt did she find her brother . A land where brother and sister , joined by blood , could become one . How to explain the terrifying ease with which she passed through ? At first the nauseous feeling , like memory , lying on a beach a long time ago when she was young then flame , then surrender . Hot dry air . The smell of saffron . Soft hands guide her and the attendants laugh . They take off her winter gumboots , giggle at her wooly toque , and get to work with cosmetic pots and potions . She is stripped , washed , mas saged with many oils . The feel of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in kohl , her arms and face sprinkled with gold dust , one breast is free , the nipple tipped with ochre . They unwrap her hair and it falls to her ankles . Finally they whisper her secret name and she is ready.She walks through the garden , barely looking at the lions , what they 've done with the pool , the sumptuous flowers . The rays blind her , and she knows that only in Egypt is the sun truly a god . And even she who loves shadows is drunk with it . Where is he ? He plays games , he leaves clues . Bits of papyrus , as stone , a carnelian on the ground.The woman is always afraid before she sees her brother . Maybe there wo n't be that click , maybe this time they wo n't be able to dance with their minds , maybe her fantastic loneliness wo n't go away . Then he 'll catch her and tickle her as if they were children but they both know they are not children anymore . In him she sees mother and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , as she rounds the corner of the garden , she sees a coffin and knows that he is dead . The trunk becomes a coffin , glowing as if irradiated.They 've killed him , it was not unexpected . They did n't want his light . They 've read ied him for burial , but they 've done such a terrible job . The coffin is cheap and where are the things he has to take to the other world ? The chests of gold , his amulets , his weapons ? And what about the body ? How well is it preserved ? Is n't that a col larbone , a knee sticking out , a finger ? What if he does n't make it across ? There must be three coffins and four magic bricks.Oh my brother , you taught me so much , because of you I learned a terrible thing . I learned to to love war . And I do . I love war like a young male loves war , like a twelve year old girl loves war . The desert and battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , because I needed you . They poured poison into you a little at a time and then they hid the bottle . The seizures were terrible , I know . Your body arched back , you shook , your limbs flailed about and you could n't do anything . God is n't only light , we know that . Let me lie down beside you and think up a curse to keep the thieves from robbing your grave . It 'll be a good curse , my brother . A humdinger . GWENDOLYN lies across the coffin . The sound of wind . Her body tears itself away . She goes stumbling into the blackness.Then she 's travelling again , she 's always travelling Let there be war ! Let me ride across desert sands and die bloody and covered with flies for some cause that none of us can understand . Do n't let me die in November in this city , the impression of a telephone imprinted on my dead belly . Send me to Egypt to dieNot yet . GWENDOLYN begins to paw the walls frantically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for something . Finally she uncovers a secret panel , inside is a silver flask . She drinks from it , glugging like a fish.I bang into this acquaintance , I would n't call him a friend , and he says he has the flu , and so does his wife and kids . He says , " It 's a bad time for families and the flu . invited to dinner in six years . And I did n't understand why I had just slipped off the edge of a world where a hundred loose acquaintances lived . People I knew almost well . Certain kinds of people , people with cars . And I thought , am I a dud at the table , is my conversation less than sparkling ? What am I , chopped liver ? They go quiet and act like they 're being kind , they would n't want to bore you with talk about their children in the face of your exciting single life but really it 's a primal act of condescension . You can talk to me about anything , why not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show , like a dirty slip hanging below my out of fashion skirt , like the bruised mask of the sick . It was starting to show , at writer 's gatherings where there are thin crowds and a lot of standing . Poor thing , only forty six , she 's looking so old , on the sauce again . Slurring her words . They ask her the future and the hag says , " I know , I 'm just not telling anyone . " No , you do n't want her sitting at the table . They think I just write sad stuff . I do not write dark fluff . Why is she ruining the neighbourhood with all those cats ? They 're protesting at the abortion clinic , but they do n't care about the animals cry ing for water . Ask me a question . Ask me a question . Okay maybe some people still called , and I did n't call them back , maybe I do n't want to go out with them anyway , maybe I 'd rather go out with George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . He does n't write poetry and he has n't had a bath in a long time . Who was it that had n't had a bath in a long time ? Oh right . My first husband . Shhhhh . I was n't going to talk about him . Not a word.We were married for five months . Five months . And no one ever forgot it . They blame me still . I was nineteen , that still counts as a teenager . He was forty two , it was a mistake . I do n't want you to think I 'm angry , I 'm not angry , but hell 's bells . How would you like to be part of a couple called beauty and the beast ? Insulting to both of us . I was no beauty , just all young people are beautiful , and was he a beast ? Was he a father figure ? Yes . Was he a brilliant poet ? Yes . Did we have wild and crazy times together ? Yes . But you could n't talk to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great raving entity . He was a stinky man . Have you ever been with a stinky man ? No , I 'm sorry , you 'd remember if you had . Oh , sometimes it was hard . Stinky men know damn well it 's hard . Their smell is a gauntlet to the world . Go away , here is my smell . Come here , rise above my smell if you are true . Love me , for my wounded animal smell . And I did . But I began not to be able to breathe . Poetry is breath , I could n't breathe . I tried to explain . And then one day you 're in the kitchen screaming , " you stink , you stink , you stink ! " And you know what he said ? " It will always be a problem . " And then you saw the beast for he sank his teeth into me and would n't let me go , howling to the world about betrayal . I married and loved for a time a grand stinky man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I died . GWENDOLYN drops years again , now appearing nineteen , standing in a wide circle of golden light.At first there are wild dreams , world dom ination , a line of t-shirts , thousands com ing to your door , leaving flowers on your stoop . I 'm published in the States , and I am twenty . If there 's no money , there will be money . If there 's never any money , I 'm just fine about that . It 's not about fame and money , it 's about the words coming out . And the world is this big . And the ground is this big . Then the circle gets a little smaller . The good publishers turn into bad publishers and the cover photo makes you look like a dweeb . And you sell less copies than expected even though everyone says the next publishers are smaller . Fine . Work . Work hard . And there 's a little less money . And it 's more difficult to find a place to live . And you almost get raped in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little smaller . There 's a grant , but the grant does n't quite cover what it was supposed to cover , and no one 's reading poetry any more , but they think you 're just so wonderful . And the bottle is bigger as the space is smaller . You say , " All right . It 's stupid , world domination . Those were young thoughts of fame and bullshit . All I want is to do good work , have some people read it and a basically full belly . " No . Fine . I 'm not going to argue . I do n't expect special treatment just because I write poetry . Work , work hard , and I 'm old and the world is reading even less poetry and that 's just fine . I 'll write a novel , there 's no need to be bound by poetry , and the novel is about someone with no identity lost in a land as big as the sky , but it 's too specific or too general , there 's something wrong with it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little smaller . You say alright I wo n't expect that , I wo n't expect to write novels and make a killing or anything like that . I just want to write poetry and have that poetry get out . No you do n't get that . You get the basement . And the circle gets a little smaller . And you quit drinking cold again and start to have convulsions , they take you to the hospital and your friends ask , " Is she an epileptic ? We always knew she was touched by the gods . " And the doctor says , " no , she 's a drunk . " And the circle gets a little smaller . And no man and no children and the fire is taking up all the room and the work is going well and I 've written it all and there 's two dollars in the bank and a green pepper for dinner and the circle is so small until you 're dancing on the head of a pin . GWENDOLYN covers her face with her arm . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her voice is slurred , coarse.Do n't look at me do n't look at me I do n't want you to know where I live you ca n't cross that line over there I do n't want you to look at me do n't poetry is breath poets are magicians without quick wrists poets are poets are breathe in and out breathe in and out waitThey 're announcing me at a reading at the Club Bamboo , my twenty published books , my awards , my alien dignity , and I come out Voices erupt from GWENDOLYN , as if she is possessed . p. 3 ( MOTHER 'S VOICE ) You fucking cunt ! I 'm going to kill myself because of you . I do n't want daughters ! ( FATHER 'S VOICE ) Come here , Gwen , come here , do n't look at her . Let me hold you . Come here . Let me . ( MOTHER 'S VOICE ) Get away from me ! I 'm going to slash my throat because of you . Blood everywhere because of you , daugh ter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's all right . I just need a drink . Do n't look at her , I just need a drink , then I 'll hold you , I just need a " It is moving above me , it is burning my heart out , I have felt it crash through my flesh , I have spoken to it in a foreign tongue , I have stroked it 's neck in the night like a wish . " 10 Do n't touch me ! " Beware ! I now know a language so beautiful and lethalmy mouth bleeds when I speak it . " 11 My blind therapist said , Gwen , you have to find more joy in your creativity . Joy . Yes . Deep inside . With my poor art and imperfectly I have wept fire , I have surfed subatomic mist , I 've raised desert Queens , I have ridden ancient battle scenes , I 've stitched up continents on my sewing machine . You ca n't begin to know the joy I feel in what I have done.But.You try and you try and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it away and you fuck it away but it comes back and back and back . No , you do n't get that . You get this . You do n't get that . You get this . And then there are no poems there is no fire there is no breath there 's a weight and a shadow . There is nothing because you are nothing . ( Singing ) You 're nothing but a nothing , a nothing , a nothing , you 're nothing but a nothingyou 're not a thing at allnot a thing at all . And even then , you think , there 's a way out . There 's an escape . There 's a way out there 's an escape . The trap gives way under your feet the basement is at the very centre of the earth but you think there 's an escape there 's got to be a there 's a there 's an escape there 's a Here 's an escape.He 's cold . Cold eyes . He 's wearing Beatle boots and the wrong kind of socks for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right amount of greasy . He 's not your lover . He is your constant companion . Every night around four in the morning , you hear him knocking . GWENDOLYN bangs her heel on the floor there times.And you say , " Thanks , not tonight . " And he replies with elaborate courtes , " Very well , Gwendolyn . Tomorrow then ? " " Tomorrow then . " There are no footsteps when he leaves . If there was just one poem left inside of me I wanted to write . Then when he came knocking , I would say , " Sorry , I 'm working . This nothing is putting out another silly poem . Pretending she 's important . Believing she 's impor tant . " And that would keep him away for a while . I could go over there and write one more brilliant poem , but why ? So this night , I answered the door , invited him in , offered him a seat on the pillows . He 's over quick and sitting down . " Would you like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't we drink what I brought ? " , he replied . It looked like vodka , except it was a strange colour of violet . His hands trembled slightly as he poured it into glasses that came right out of his leather jacket . GWENDOLYN takes out a brandy glass from another secret compartment . The glass contains a liquid that is a strange colour of violet . " Shall I put on some music ? " I said . He said , " I 'll play myself . " He took out a gypsy violin and played beautifully except icicles hung from the bow . I was careful never to look into his eyes and he knew it too . " I seem to have lost the taste for poetry , " I said . " Really ? How very sad . " " But I have n't lost the taste for this . " She raises the glass to her lips , then lowers it , untouched.Still I did n't drink . " Funny , I was a howl ing maniac just a few minutes ago and now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It is the Eve of Destruction , " he said . " A party to end all parties . " Still I did n't drink . I smelt . Oh you 've never smelled a drink like the one my Lord Death brings to the door . Sweet and fiery The whole world went violet for a moment , as if it was being covered in cellophane . Coated . He was smiling so lonely like a child I knew what had to be done . " I 'm sorry , " I said . " I would like to invite you to stay , and have a lovely time , but I 've decided I 'm not going to drink tonight . " He looked very grave . " Have you forgotten the pain ? " I smiled , " Oh , I 'm an expert on not forgetting the pain . " We both knew what was to come . He rose with his exquisite politeness , even made a courtly bow . My hands were already starting to shake , but I think I hid it well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paused , trying one last time , saying with great tenderness , " Why choose such a fate when one small sip with me " I was tender too . I knew his lips would taste like sand . " The next time you come , you 'll have to break down my door . " With that , he was gone . WENDOLYN turns the glass she has been holding upside down . White sand spills onto the floor . She gazes at the audience , as if pouring herself into them . Then she begins picking up the pillow , the manacles , the glass , and moves toward the trunk . As she approaches , once again , it opens by itself.I 'm sorry , but I did warn you . In silence , GWENDOLYN kneels behind the trunk , packs her things and goes to stand . Almost imperceptibly , she loses her balance , grabbing for the lid of the trunk . The marrow of her bones seems to be shaking . She steadies herself . Lying on the chair is the wondrous cloth . Moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her with no flourish at all , and gathers it in her arms . She seems confused , as if she does n't know how to get back to the trunk . But she executes the journey , placing the cloth inside . Her arms reach up to close the lid , the fingers white as light.I want you to know I was brave . I want you to know I fought hard , I want you to know I loved beauty , that I laughed . I want you to know I was a coward . GWENDOLYN stands and moves towards the audience , becoming taller and broader and wiser , more beautiful , more powerful , more pure . " I swear by all the famous , ancient lions I have knownThat the mighty children yet to comewill foster finer stars , For they are the true lords , born of morning , whose coming will call us down like a deck of cards . " 12 The lights begin to fade as GWENDOLYN smiles . " I am starting to haunt you . I am starting right now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an after-image of GWENDOLYN 's face hovers in the air .
