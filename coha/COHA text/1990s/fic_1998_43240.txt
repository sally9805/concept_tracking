Scene : The action of the play takes place in the Simple Notion Shop , owned and operated by Miss Dorothy Simple , a New England maiden of twenty-six , who is physically very attractive but has barricaded her house and her heart behind a double row of petunias . The town is Primanproper , Massachusetts , which lies within the cultural orbit of Boston . The play starts in the early morning . Miss Simple , very agitated for some reason , has just opened her little shop . She stands in an open door in a food of spring sunlight , but her face expresses grief and indignation . She is calling to a police of her on the corner Dorothy : Officer ? - Officer ! Officer ( strolling up to her ) : Yes , Miss Simple ? DorOthy : I wish to report a case of deliberate and malicious sabotage ! Officer : Sabotage of what , Miss Simple ? Dorothy : Of my petunias ! Officer : Well , well , well . Now what do you mean by that ? Dorothy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself . Last night this house was surrounded by a beautiful double row of pink and lavender petunias . Look at them now ! When I got up this morning I discovered them in this condition . Every single little petunia deliberately and maliciously crushed underfoot ! officer : My goodness ! Well , well , well ! Dorothy : " Well , well , well " is not going to catch the culprit ! Officer : . What do you want me to do , Miss Simple ? Dorothy : I want you to apprehend a petuniacidal maniac with a size eleven-D foot . Officer : Eleven-D ? Dorothy : : Yes . That is the size of the footprints that crushed my petunias . I just now had them measured by a shoe clerk . Officer : That 's a pretty large foot , Miss Simple , but lots of men have got large feet . Dorothy : Not in Primanproper , Massachusetts . Mr. Knowzit , the shoe clerk , assured me that there is n't a man in town who wears a shoe that size . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain at large . Any man who would crush a sweet petunia is equally capable in my opinion of striking a helpless woman or kicking an innocent child ! Officer : I 'll do my best , Miss Simple . See yuh later . Dorothy ( curtly ) : Yes . Goodbye . ( Slams door She returns behind her notion counter and drums restively with her pale-pink polished nails . The canary cheeps timidly . Then tries the arpeggio . Dorothy , to canary . ) Oh , hush up ! ( then contritely ) Excuse me , please . My nerves are all to pieces ! ( Blows her nose . The doorbell tinkles as a customer enters . He is a young man , shockingly large and aggressive-looking in the flowerpatterned cubicle of the shop . ) Gracious , please be careful . You 're bumping your head against my chandelier . Young Man ( good-humoredly ) : Sorry , Miss Simple . I guess I 'd better sit down . ( The delicate little chair collapses beneath him . ) Dorothy : Heaven have mercy upon us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 've broken that little antique chair to smithereens ! Young Man : Sorry , Miss Simple . Dorothy : I appreciate your sorrow , but that wo n't mend my chair. - Is there anything I can show you in the way of notions ? Young Man : I 'd like to see that pair of wine-colored socks you have in the window . DOroUn : What size socks do you wear ? Young Man : I keep forgetting But my shoes are eleven-D . Dorothy ( sharply ) : What size did you say ? Eleven ? Eleven-D ? Young Man : That 's right , Miss Simple . Eleven-D . DOrothy : Oh . Your shoes are rather muddy , are n't they ? Young Man : That 's right , Miss Simple , I believe they are . Dtr1 : Quite muddy . It looks like you might have stepped in a freshly watered flower bed last night . Young Man : Come to think of it , that 's what I did . Dolhy : I do n't suppose you 've heard about that horrible case of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter of fact , I have heard something about it . DOrty : From the policeman on the corner ? fBung Mail : No , ma'am . Not from him . DOrthy : Who from , then ? He 's the only man who knows about it exceptexcept-except-the man who did it ! ( Pause . The canary cheeps inquiringly ) You-you-you-are the man who did it ! Yg Man : Yes , Miss Simple . I am the man who did it . Dorthy : Do n't try to get away ! Young Man : I wo n't , Miss Simple . Dorothy : Stand right where you are till the officer comes ! Young Man : Are you going to call the officer ? Dorothy : Yes , I am , I certainly am. - In a minute . First I 'd like to ask vou w vou did it ? Why did you crush my petunias ? YOUN Man : Ok . I 'll tell you why . First , because you 'd barricaded your houseand also your heart-behind that silly little double row of petunias ! Dorothy : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do n't know what you mean . Young Man : I know . They 're apparently such delicate , fragile creatures , these petunias , but they have a terrible resistance . Dorothy : Resistance to what , may I ask ? Young Man : Anything big or important that happens to come by your house . Nothing big or important can ever get by a double row of petunias ! That is the reason why you are living alone with your canary and beginning to dislike it . Dorothy : Dislike my canary ? I love it ! Young Man : Secretly , Miss Simple , you wish the birdseed would choke it ! You dislike it nearly as much as you secretly disliked your petunias . Dorothy : Why should I , why should you , why should anybody dislike petunias ? Young Man : Our animosity and its resultant action is best explained by a poem I once composed on the subject of petunias-and similar flora . Would you like to hear it ? Dorothy : I suppose I should , if it 's relevant to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes like this : ( LIGHT MUSIC ) How grimly do petunias look on things not listed in the book , For these dear creatures never move outside the academic groove . They mark with sharp and moral eye phenomena that pass them by And classify as good or evil mammoth whale or tiny weevil . They note with consummate disdain all that is masculine or plain . They blush down to their tender roots when men pass by in working boots . All honest language shocks them so they cringe to hear a rooster crow . Of course they say that good dean fun 's permissible for every one But find that even Blindman 's Bluff is noisy and extremely rough And- ( stage whisper ) - Not quite innocent enough ! What do you think of it ? Dorothy : Unfair ! Completely unfair ! Yong Man ( laughing ) : To organized petunias ? DOrothy : Yes , and besides , I do n't think anyone has the right to impose his opinions in the form of footprints on other people 's petunias ! Yeog Man ( remng small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete restitution . Dorothy : What with ? Young Man : With these . Dorothy : What are they ? Young Man : Seeds . Dorothy : Seeds of what ? Sedition ? Young Man : No . Wild roses . Dorothy : Wild ? I could n't use them ! Young Man : Why not , Miss Simple ? Dorothy : Flowers are like human beings . They ca n't be allowed to grow wild . They have to be Young Man : Regimented ? Ahhh . I see . You 're a horticultural fascist ! Dorothy ( with an indignant , gasp ) : I ought to call the policeman about those petunias ! Young Man : Why do n't you , then ? Dorothy : Only because you made an honest confession . Young Man : That 's not why , Miss Simple . Dorothy : No ? Young Man : The actual reason is that you are fascinated . Dorothy : Am I ? Indeed ! Young Man : Indeed you are , Miss Simple . In spite of your late unlamented petunias , you 're charmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're very conceited ! Young Mall : Now , if you please , I 'd like to ask you a question . Dorothy : You may . But I may not answer . Young Man : You will if you can . But you probably wo n't be able . The question is this : What do you make of it all ? Doro " : I do n't understand-All what ? Young Man : The world ? The universe ? And your position in it ? This miraculous accident of being alive ! ( soft music in the background ) Has it ever occurred to you how much the living are outnumbered by the dead ? Their numerical superiority , Miss Simple , is so tremendous that you could n't possibly find a ratio with figures vast enough above the line , and small enough below to represent it . Dortil : You sound like you were trying to sell me something . Young Man : I am , I am , just wait ! Dorothy : I 'm not in the market for Young Man : Please ! One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . One minute . Young Man:look ! Dorothy : At what ? Photograph Editor 's note <p> Young Man : Those little particles of dust in the shaft of April sunlight through that window . Dorothy : What about them ? Young Man : Just think . You might have been one of those instead of what you are . You might have been any one of those infinitesimal particles of dust . Or any one of millions and billions and trillions of other particles of mute , unconscious matter . Never capable of asking any questions . Never capable of giving answers . Never capable of doing , thinking , feeling anything at all ! But instead , dear lady , by the rarest and most improbable of accidents , you happened to be what you are . Miss Dorothy Simple from Boston ! Beautiful . Human . Alive . Capable of thought and feeling and action . Now here comes the vital part of my question . What are you going to do about it , Miss Simple ? Dorothy ( who is somewhat moved , in spite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I thought you came in here to buy some socks ? Young Man : Yes , but I 've got to sell you something first . Dorothy : Sell me what ? Young Man : A wonderful bill of goods . Dorothy : I 'll have to see it before I sign the order . Young Man : That 's impossible . I ca n't display my samples in this shop . Doroth : Why not ? Young Man : They 're much too precious . You have to make an appointment . Dorothy ( retreating ) : Sorry . But I do all my business in here . Young Man : Too bad for you . - In fact , too bad for us both . Maybe you 'll change your mind ? Dorothy : I do n't think so . Y.g Man : Anyway , here 's my card . Dorothy ( reading it , bewildered ) : LifeIncorporated. ( looks up slowly ) Young Man : Yes . I represent that line . Dorthy : I see . You 're a magazine salesman ? Young Man : No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's matter , though ? Young Man : Oh , yes , and it 's matter of tremendous importance , too . But it 's neglected by people . Because of their ignorance they 've been buying cheap substitute products . And lately a rival concern has sprung up outside the country This firm is known as " Death Unlimited . " " Their product comes in a package labeled " War . " They 're crowding us out with new aggressive methods of promotion . And one of their biggest sales points is " Excitement " Why does it work so well ? Because you little people surround your houses and also your hearts with rows of tiresome , trivial little things like petunias ! If we could substitute wild roses , there would n't be wars ! No , there 'd be excitement enough in the world without having wars ! That 's why we 've started this petunia-crushing campaign , Miss Simple . " Life , Incorporated " has come to the realization that we have to use the same aggressive methods of promotion used by " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to show people that the malignantly trivial little petunias of the world can be eliminated more cleanly , permanently , and completely by " Life , Incorporated " than by " Death , Unlimited " ! Now what do you say , Miss Simple ? Wo n't you try our product ? Doro/ ( nervously ) : Well , you see it 's like this-I do all my buying in Boston and Young Man : What do you buy in Boston ? Dorily : You can see for youreself . Look over the stock . Young Man ( examining the shelves ) : Thimbles-threads-ladies " needlework-white gloves Dormly : Notions . Odds and ends . Young Man : Odds and ends-of existence ? Dorothy : Yes , that 's it exactly . Young Man : What do you do after hours ? Dorothy : I carry on a lot of correspondence . Young Man : Who with ? Dorothy : With wholesale firms in Boston . Young Man : How do you sign your letters ? Dorothy : " Sincerely " " As ever " " Very truly yours . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Love ?

Afterwards IIl take you for a ride in an open car . Doro ! ly : Where to ? Young Man : To Cypress Hill . Dothy : Why , that 's the cemetery Young Man : Yes , I know . Dothy : Why there ? Young Man : Because dead people give the best advice . Do1ty : Advice on what ? Young Man : The problems of the living . DOrothy : What advice do they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Dorothy : Live ? Young Man : Yes , live , live , live ! It 's all they know , it 's the only word left in their vocabulary ! Dor01y : I do n't see how- ? Young Man : I 'll tell you how . There 's one thing in Death 's favor . It 's a wonderful process of simplification . It rids the heart of all inconsequentials . For instance , it goes through the dictionary with an absolutely merciless blue pencil . Finally all that you 've got left 's one page-and on that page , one word ! Doro " : The word you hear at night on Cypress Hill ! Young Man : The word you hear at night on Cypress Hill ! Dorothy : Ohhh . Oh , oh ! Young Man : But no one hears it till they deal with me . I have a secret patented device that makes it audible to them . Something never processed by DuPont . But none the less a marvelous invention . It 's absolutely weightless and transparent . It fits inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have it on . But this guarantee : you 'll hear that word , that sound much like the long , sweet sound of leaves in motion ! Dorothy : Leaves ? Young Mall : Yes , the willow leaves or leaves of cypresses or leaves of windblown grass ! And afterwards you 'll never be the same . No , you 'll be changed forever ! D@tlt : In what way ? Young Man : You 'll live , live , live ! - And not behind petunias . How about it , Miss Simple ? Dorothy ? Is it a date ? Tonight at about half-past eight on No. 77 ? DoShy : Whereabouts on Highway No. 77 ? Young Man:Il ; By the wild plum tree-at the broken place in the long stone wallwhere roots have cleft the rocks and made them crumble .
