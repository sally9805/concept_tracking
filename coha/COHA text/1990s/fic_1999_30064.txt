The telegram in my hand read : RUSSELL NEED YOU IN DEVONSHIRE . IF FREE TAKE EARLIEST TRAIN CORYTON . IF NOT FREE COME ANYWAY . BRING COMPASS . CHAPTER ONE CONTINES HOLMES To say I was irritated would be an understatement . We had only just pulled ourselves from the mire of a difficult and emotionally draining case and now , less than a month later , with my mind firmly turned to the work awaiting me in this , my spiritual home , Oxford , my husband and longtime partner Sherlock Holmes proposed with this peremptory telegram to haul me away into his world once more . With an effort , I gave my landlady 's housemaid a smile , told her there was no reply ( Holmes had neglected to send the address for a response  --  no accident on his part ) , and shut the door . I refused to speculate on why he wanted me , what purpose a compass would serve , or indeed what he was doing in Devon at all , since when last I had heard he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burglary from an impregnable vault in Berlin . I squelched all impulse to curiosity , and returned to my desk . Two hours later the girl interrupted my reading again , with another flimsy envelope . This one read : ALSO SIX INCH MAPS EXETER TAVISTOCK OKEHAMPTON . CLOSE YOUR BOOKS . LEAVE NOW . HOLMES Damn the man , he knew me far too well . I found my heavy brass pocket compass in the back of a drawer . It had never been quite the same since being first cracked and then drenched in an aqueduct beneath Jerusalem some four years before , but it was an old friend and it seemed still to work reasonably well . I dropped it into a similarly well-travelled rucksack , packed on top of it a variety of clothing to cover the spectrum of possibilities that lay between arctic expedition and tiara-topped dinner with royalty ( neither of which , admittedly , were beyond Holmes ' reach ) , added the book on Judaism in mediaeval Spain that I had been reading , and went out to buy the requested stack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of England . * * * * * * * At Coryton , in Devon , many hours later , I found the station deserted and dusk fast closing in . I stood there with my rucksack over my shoulder , boots on feet , and hair in cap , listening to the train chuff away towards the next minuscule stop . An elderly married couple had also got off here , climbed laboriously into the sagging farm cart that awaited them , and been driven away . I was alone . It was raining . It was cold . There was a certain inevitability to the situation , I reflected , and dropped my rucksack to the ground to remove my gloves , my waterproof , and a warmer hat . Straightening up , I happened to turn slightly and noticed a small , light-coloured square tacked up to the post by which I had walked . Had I not turned , or had it been half an hour darker , I should have missed it entirely . Russell it said on the front . Unfolded , it proved to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just make out the words , in Holmes ' writing : Lew House is two miles north . Do you know the words to " Onward Christian Soldiers " or " Widdecombe Fair " ?  --  H. I dug back into the rucksack , this time for a torch . When I had confirmed that the words did indeed say what I had thought , I tucked the note away , excavated clear to the bottom of the rucksack for the compass to check which branch of the track fading into the murk was pointing north , and set out . I had n't the faintest idea what he meant by that note . I had heard the two songs , one a thumping hymn and the other one of those overly precious folk songs , but I did not know their words other than one song 's decidedly ominous ( to a Jew ) introductory image of Christian soldiers marching behind their " cross of Jesus " and the other 's endless and drearily jolly chorus of " Uncle Tom Cobbley and all . " In the first place , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was not usually of the sort wherein such hymns were standard fare , and as for the second , well , thus far none of my friends had succumbed to the artsy allure of sandals , folk songs , and Morris dancing . I had not seen Holmes in nearly three weeks , and it did occur to me that perhaps in the interval my husband had lost his mind . Two miles is no distance at all on a smooth road on a sunny morning , but in the wet and moonless dark in which I soon found myself , picking my way down a slick , rutted track , following the course of a small river which I could not see , but could hear , smell , and occasionally step in , two miles was a fair trek . And there was something else as well : I felt as if I were being followed , or watched . I am not normally of a nervous disposition , and when I have such feelings I tend to assume that they have some basis in reality , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wind , and when I stopped there were no echoing splashes of feet behind me . It was simply a sense of Presence in the night ; I pushed on , trying to ignore it . I stayed to the left when the track divided , and was grateful to find , when time came to cross the stream , that a bridge had been erected across it . Not that wading through the water would have made me much wetter , and admittedly it would have cleared my lower extremities of half a hundredweight of mud , but the bridge as a solid reminder of Civilisation in the form of county councils I found encouraging . Having crossed the stream , I now left its burble behind me , exchanging the hiss of rain on water for the thicker noises of rain on mud and vegetation , and I was just telling myself that it could n't be more than another half mile when I heard a faint thread of sound . Another hundred yards and I could hear it above the suck and plop of my boots ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a violin , playing a sweet , plaintive melody , light and slow and shot through with a profound and permanent sadness . I had never , to my knowledge , heard the tune before , although it had the bone-deep familiarity possessed by all things that are very old . I did , however , know the hands that wielded the bow . " Holmes ? " I said into the dark . He finished the verse , drawing out the long final note , before he allowed the instrument to fall silent . " Hello , Russell . You took your time . " " Holmes , I hope there is a good reason for this . " He did not answer , but I heard the familiar sounds of violin and bow being put into a case . The latches snapped , followed by the vigorous rustle of a waterproof being donned . I turned on the torch in time to see Holmes stepping out of the small shelter of a roofed gate set into a stone wall . He paused , looking thoughtfully at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elbow , the result of a misstep into a pothole . " Why did you not use the torch , coming up the road ? " he asked . " I , er ... " I was embarrassed . " I thought there was someone following me . I did n't want to give him the advantage of a torch-light . " " Following you ? " he said sharply , half-turning to squint down the road . " Watching me . That back-of-the-neck feeling . " I saw his face clearly by the light of the torch . " Ah yes . Watching you . That 'll be the moor . " " The Moor ? " I said in astonishment . I knew where I was , of course , but for an instant the book I had been reading on the train was closer to mind than my sense of geography , and I was confronted by the brief mental image of a dark-skinned scimitar-bearing Saracen lurking along a Devonshire country lane . " Dartmoor . It 's just there . " He nodded over his shoulder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or five miles away , and although you ca n't see it from here , it casts a definite presence over the surrounding countryside . You 'll meet it tomorrow . Come , " he said , turning up the road . " Let us take to the warm and dry . " I left the torch on now . It played across the hedgerow on one side and a stone wall on the other , illuminating for a moment a French road sign ( some soldier 's wartime souvenir , no doubt ) , giving us a brief glimpse of headstones in a churchyard just before we turned off into a smaller drive . A thick layer of rotting leaves from the row of half-bare elms and copper beeches over our heads gave way to a cultivated garden  --  looking more neglected than even the season and the rain would explain , but nonetheless clearly intended to be a garden  --  and finally one comer of a two-storey stone house , the small pieced panes of its tall windows reflecting the torch 's beam . The near corner was dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind curtains , and the light from a covered porch spilled its welcome out across the weedy drive and onto a round fountain . We ducked inside the small space , and had begun to divest ourselves of the wettest of our outer garments when the door opened in front of us . In the first instant I thought it was a butler standing there , the sort of lugubrious aged retainer a manor house of this size would have , as seedy and tired as the house itself , and as faithful and long-serving . It was his face , however , more than the old-fashioned clerical collar and high-buttoned frock coat he wore , that straightened my spine . Stooped with age he might be , but this was no servant . The tall old man leant on his two walking sticks and took his time looking me over through the wire spectacles he wore . He examined the tendrils of escaped hair that straggled wetly down my face , the slime of mud up my clothing , the muck-encrusted boot I held in my hand , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removed the boot . Eventually he shifted his gaze to that of my lawfully wedded husband . " We have been waiting for this person ? " he asked . Holmes turned to look at me , and his long mouth twitched  --  minutely , but enough . Had it not been that going back into the night would have meant a close flirtation with pneumonia , I should immediately have laced my boot back on and left those two sardonic males to their own company . Instead , I let the boot drop to the stone floor , sending small clots of mud slopping about the porch ( some of which , I was pleased to see , ended up on Holmes ' trouser leg ) , and bent to my rucksack . It was more or less dry , as I had been wearing it underneath the waterproof ( a procedure which made me resemble a hunchback and left the coat gaping open in the front , but at least guarantied that I should have a dry change of clothing when I reached my destination ) . I snatched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fat bundle of cloth-mounted , large-scale maps , and threw it in the direction of Holmes . He caught it . " The maps you asked for , " I said coldly . " When is the next train out of Coryton ? " Holmes had the grace to look discomfited , if briefly , but the old man in the doorway simply continued to look as if he were smelling something considerably more unpleasant than sodden wool . Neither of them answered me , but Holmes ' next words were in a voice that verged on gentle , tantamount to an apology . " Come , Russell . There 's a fire and hot soup . You 'll take your death out here . " Somewhat mollified , I removed my other boot , picked up my rucksack , and followed him into the house , stepping past the cleric , who shut the door behind us . When I was inside and facing the man , Holmes made his tardy introductions . " Gould , may I present my partner and , er , wife , Mary Russell . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One would think , I reflected as I shook the old man 's large hand , that with two and a half years of marriage behind him the idea of having a wife would come more easily , at least to his tongue . However , I had to admit that we both normally referred to the other as partner rather than spouse , and the form of our married life was in truth more that of two individuals than that of a bound couple . Aside , of course , from certain activities rendered legal by a bit of paper . The Reverend Sabine Baring-Gould made the minimum polite re- sponse and suggested that Holmes show me upstairs . I wondered if I was to be allowed back down afterwards , or if I ought to say good-bye to him now . Holmes caught up a candlestick and lit its taper from a lamp on the table , and I followed him out of the warmth , through a dark-panelled passageway ( my stockings squelching on the thin patches in the carpeting ) , and up what by the wavering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faces . " Holmes , " I hissed . " Who on earth is that old goat ? And when are you going to tell me what you dragged me down here for ? " " That ' old goat ' is the Reverend Sabine Baring-Gould , squire of Lew Trenchard , antiquarian , self-educated expert in half a dozen fields , and author of more books than any other man listed in the British Museum . Hymnist , collector of country music  --  " A small light went on in my mind . " ' Onward Christian Soldiers ' ? ' Widdecombe Fair ' ? " " He wrote the one and collected the other . Rural parson , " he continued , " novelist , theologian "  --  Yes , I thought , I had heard of him somewhere , connected with dusty tomes of archaic ideas  --  " amateur architect , amateur archaeologist , amateur of many things . He is one of the foremost living experts on the history and life of Dartmoor . He is a client with a case . He is also , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were talking I had followed the candle up the stairway with its requisite portraits of dim and disapproving ancestors and through a small gallery with a magnificent plaster ceiling , but at this final statement I stopped dead . Fortunately , he did not go much farther , but opened a door and stepped into a room . After a moment , I followed , and found him turning up the lights in a nice-sized bedroom with rose-strewn paper on the walls ( peeling up slightly at the seams ) and a once-good , rose-strewn carpet on the floor . I put the rucksack on a chair that looked as if it had seen worse usage and sat gingerly on the edge of the room 's soft , high bed . " Holmes , " I said . " I do n't know that I 've ever heard you describe anyone other than Watson as a friend . " " No ? " He bent to set a match to the careful arrangement of sticks and logs that had been laid in the fireplace . There was a large radiator in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed , it stood sullen and cold in its corner . " Well , it is true . I do not have many . " " How do you know him ? " " Oh , I 've known Baring-Gould for a long time . I used him on the Baskerville case , of course . I needed a local informant into the life of the natives and his was the name that turned up , a man who knew everything and went everywhere . We correspond on occasion , he came to see me in Baker Street two or three times , and once in Sussex . " I could n't see how this sparse contact qualified the man for friendship , but I did n't press him . " I should n't imagine he ' goes everywhere ' now . " " No . Time is catching up with him . " " How old is he ? " " Nearly ninety , I believe . Five years ago you 'd have thought him a hearty seventy . Now there are days when he does not get out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trace of sorrow beneath his matter-of-fact words . Totally unexpected and , having met the object of this affection , quite inexplicable . " You said he had a case for us ? " " He will review the facts after we 've eaten . There 's a bath next door , although I do n't know that I would recommend it ; there seems to be no hot water at the moment . "
