Phantom is off to a great start . But should it have been greater ? // AS DARTH MAUL CAN TELL you , double-headed lightsabers are cool-but they cut both ways . After months ( or was it years ? ) of hype , The Phantom Menace finally arrived , hitting theaters May 19 with industry-shaking power . Thanks to tent-dwelling fanatics and round-the-clock showings , Phantom took in $28.5 million on its first day , breaking The Lost World 's 1997 record of $26.1 million . Phantom continued barreling through the week : By Monday , it had tallied $105.7 million , the biggest five-day opening ever ( old mark : Independence Day 's $96.1 million ) . " These numbers are humongous ! " says Fox Domestic Film Group chief Tom Sherak . " It 's a home run . " Actually , it 's more like a ground-rule double . Despite Sherak 's cheerleading , most observers felt Menace 's numbers were intriguingly middle  --  of-the-road . George Lucas ' opus did n't break the most-revered box office record-highest three-day weekend gross . ( Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) And it did not come close to some experts ' predictions of $130 million and beyond . " Clearly the first day was n't a disappointment , " says Merrill Lynch media analyst Stuart Rossmiller , " but the weekend could 've been a little higher . " Adds Exhibitor Relations " Paul Dergarabedian , " Everybody was saying $120 to $140 million for five days , and it just did n't happen . " In all fairness , many of those predictions-especially the ones in the $150-175 million range-were as over-the-top as Jar Jar 's antics . Given that the film was playing on an estimated 5,000 screens , and assuming that it played five times a day at midsize theaters of roughly 300 seats , a ticket price of $4.69 ( the national average ) would yield a maximum five-day gross of about $175 million . And that 's assuming sellouts for every show at every theater for nearly a week . That exercise illustrates how unprecedented the expectations for Phantom were .

" They thought : It 's too crowded , I wo n't get in . I 'll wait . " ' Admits Lucasfilm president Gordon Radley , " We 've heard a lot of people felt there were n't tickets available . " Photograph // Another factor that put a damper on Phantom 's coming  --  out party : exhibitor backlash . Lucas had procured unheard-of concessions from theater owners . Among the demands : Lucasfilm will receive 90 percent of the first- and second-week grosses ( typically , studios take 70 percent ) , and exhibitors are required to book Menace for at least 12 weeks-in other words , the whole summer . Loews Cineplex Entertainment refused to play along with its New York City theaters , meaning that Menace did n't play in some of Manhattan 's prime cinemas , including the Sony Lincoln Square , the most lucrative movie house in the nation . At an investment conference last week , Loews CEO Larry Ruisi noted : " We play hardball . If you roll over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everybody else . " Radley counters , " Look , it 's playing at the 1,200-seat Ziegfeld , so it 's hardly lost in the Manhattan scheme of things . " For now , most exhibitors are n't complaining too loudly . With Memorial Day weekend looming for the film 's second week , no one 's betting against the Force just yet . But the key tests will come in the following weeks . That 's when mixed critical notices could affect repeat business . " It ca n't do Titanic numbers , " a marketing exec at a rival studio says , referring to the big boat 's $600 million gross . " It wo n't even beat Jurassic Park $357 million . It will only get repeat business from young kids and geeks . " Radley bristles at such summations . " We 're not competing with Titanic , " he says . " We 're doing what 's right for Star Wars . Whatever Star Wars ultimately makes at the box office , that 'll be its destiny . " Spoken like a true Jedi . E @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) <p>
