How do you portray a people ? For this week 's cover story , senior writer Lance Morrow and Jerusalem bureau reporter Jamil Hamad avoided the politicians who regularly define the Palestinian cause . " Rhetoric in the Middle East has an elaborate life of its own , " explains Morrow . " It tends to obscure the truth . " Instead of gathering familiar slogans , the two constructed their group portrait from the personal tales of a wide array of ordinary Palestinians . Says Hamad : " We decided to let readers judge for themselves the fears and dreams that filled our notebooks . " <P> For Hamad , a Palestinian , the project had special import . Born in Rafat , a now demolished Arab village located in what is Israel today , he says , " I am acutely aware that we Palestinians are misunderstood as a people . " He tells of an elegant Palestinian woman , Hanan Bargouthi , who , having undergone a humiliating search at a London airport , observed bitterly , " I am Palestinian by birth , Jordanian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrorist according to security people . " <P> Both Morrow and Hamad approached the story well briefed . Hamad , who studied law at Damascus University , has worked for Arab newspapers in Morocco , Lebanon and Jordan , and was a free-lance journalist in Jerusalem before joining TIME 's bureau there in 1982 . Morrow , who is based in New York City , has visited Israel six times in the past 2 1/2 years . He confesses to painfully divided sympathies : " The Israelis and the Palestinians , " he says , " are a kind of moral-political double exposure , two universes set down in the same place . " <P> As Hamad and Morrow collected their tales , they discovered that although the Palestinians are widely dispersed , their universe in some ways remains a village . Hamad was two hours into an interview with a family in the West Bank before he realized that he was related by marriage to one of its members . While he was interviewing students in Jordan , a teacher overheard that he lived in Bethlehem , the man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hamad ? " asked the teacher . Hamad laughed and replied , " I am Jamil Hamad . " The two had not seen each other in 20 years .
