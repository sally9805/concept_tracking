Chapter OneAnswer the door after midnight and you might as well set a place at the table for trouble -- Chloe Morgan 's first thoughts when the knock came . Hannah , her shepherd , let out an initial throaty growl from her nest of blankets , then thumped her tail in the dark for the all clear . Tugging the horse blanket from her bed , Chloe padded barefoot across the rough plywood floor . Rule one : You were damn careful out here in the middle of nowhere . Hugh Nichols let a select few live in the slapped-together shacks on his two hundred acres ; he 'd be damned if he 'd sell out to developers so they could fling stucco around his land . But when it came to just who got to stay and who did n't , he was mercurial . You did nothing to make him question his decision . Few of the shacks had electricity , but Nichols had tapped into the county water , so it was n't all that bad . Rig up a hose and you could take a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you could light a hurricane lamp -- oil was n't expensive . Living here was safer than the streets had been , when she 'd lain awake in her truck till dawn , fearful of every noise . Each night since she 'd moved here , she said a silent prayer of thanks for the roof . So far the county had left them alone , but she was n't naive enough to think it would last . Who knew ? You did what you could and then you moved on . She walked quietly through the dark and rested her cheekagainst the plywood door . " What do you want ? " " You got a call . " The voice was Francisco Montoya 's , who lived nearest to the pay phone and the main house , where Nichols slept off his legendary drunks and fought with a series of women he believed were after his considerable bankroll . Bad news could always wait . " Tell whoever it is to call back in the morning . " He tapped louder now . " Chloe , you got to wake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is foaling . He asks for your help . " She cursed softly to herself . " Okay , Francisco , thanks . Go on back to sleep . " Naked except for the blanket , twelve hours ' work under her belt and only two hours ' sleep , she wanted to go back to bed and the respite of unconsciousness . Earlier , the night air had smelled like rain and her truck tires were showing steel . Now Phil Green 's mare was giving birth . So what ? Did he want her to share in the joy of it ? She despised foaling -- the utter mess it could turn into , the way owners got stupid with pink or blue birth announcements , and all that crepe-paper nonsense . Too often she 'd seen tiny hooves lacerate the vaginal wall , an ignored infection rack fine horseflesh until death came like an awkward blessing . The heartbreaking view of twins haunted her still -- she 'd sworn off all that -- simply tried not to think about it and get on with her own work , teaching people to ride . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never would . Out her only window , she watched the reflective stripes on Francisco 's jacket dim as he trudged back up the hill to his own place . Home was an old tow-along silver Airstream , complete with electricity he 'd jerry-rigged off a truck battery . Constantina was pregnant again , and their four-year-old daughter , Pilar , was just out of County Med with a winter bug that had turned into pneumonia . Out here a lot of things could level you , but Francisco and Constantina were illegals . They lived in fear of illness . The expense and the lack of proof of citizenship were more nightmarish than enduring the sickness . Once in the hospital , anything could happen . Social workers did n't help any , separating everyone . So they took care of each other out here , circled their wagons when there was trouble , recycled scrap aluminum , fed each other 's animals when money was tight . Hannah sat obediently by Chloe 's side , snapping at some unseen insect . She had slim pickings in winter . Chloe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minute , cursing motherhood , winter rains , the night in general . Then she got up , threw a pink sweatshirt over a denim miniskirt and found her tennis shoes , the only pair of footwear dry enough to be of service . " Go get in the truck , " she told the dog , and Hannah flew out the door , down the fire road , and into the bed of the old Chevy Apache , her bent tail folding beneath her like a flag at dusk . The truck started on the second try , a good omen . Chloe drove out of the compound without her headlights so as not to wake any more of the squatters than she had to . Forget reason and plausibility , there were times Chloe swore she heard voices out here . Not babbling or devil tongues , human voices . Once she figured she was n't crazy , she decided maybe they belonged to people who had died long before , whose very lives had been erased by time and progress , but who were n't quite done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drove through the canyons in darkness , half asleep , on the watch for deer crossing , she heard them the clearest . Hermana , hija .. . . They called her back from swerving off the highway , kept her awake . Tonight they were saying , La yegua sufre . . . tocala .. . . She kept the windows rolled up and did n't stop for anyone . You did n't need a newspaper story to learn the wisdom of the road -- everyone was suspect -- everyone had an agenda . But that did n't stop her from stealing sidelong glances at two hitchhikers , noting their hopeful grins , the echo of others who seemed to single her out , speak to her . &shy; Date prisa , por aca ! She would have liked the company of another warm body , even if they never touched or spoke . Just someone along for the ride . Like Fats had been , Fats Valentine . Stop it . Her life was singular now , since his death . There , past the junction at Cook 's Corner , as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two bikers stumble out onto the tarmac . That character with his thumb out -- his face held an echo of Fats 's smile . Probably dangerously drunk , his liver halfway to cirrhosis . The other guy had the jutting brow of a Neanderthal and probably a survival knife to match every outfit . Forty years ago , he might have been an immigrant orange picker , his overalls thick with the labors of a night spent smudging , hope suffusing the weariness in his bones as he rounded another row of trees in the glistening frost . But the trees were n't there anymore , were they ? A whole town surrounding the giant , nearly new university had sprung up like concrete circus tents . Still the words whispered in her ear , the breath faintly erotic as it tickled her neck flesh : Nunca seremos vencidos . Este nio representa mi sufrimiento , y mi esperanza . She shook her head drowsily and in the distance before her saw the freeway , a trickle of moving cars . Stay awake , she commanded herself . Phil Green needs your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and crash someplace like Irvine . You think the city fathers would name a street corner after you ? No way , sister . Scrape you up like the rest of the trees and pour concrete for a new foundation . But under the hard shell of highway she felt something else press against her tires . Preremembrances she could not possibly know , yet did . The faint outlines of roadhouses from sixty years ago shimmered before her eyes like heat mirages . She heard bits of tinny music from an old upright that had traveled the plains in a covered wagon , losing a few strings to the desert animals who thought they might make fine nesting material . Old music , simple , prim love songs asking permission to court and woo . People who were n't there . Visions . The result of some kind of brain irregularity you developed , deprived of sleep and adequate protein ? All she knew was they had to do with the earth somehow , a past so charged with promise that it could n't quite give up its grip on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never felt lonely . She saw them shimmer in those heat mirages ; they were in serious desert now , land not in the least fertile , no longer preoccupied with rain but resigned to the stasis of hot waiting . All those faces -- what did they want to tell her ? Did n't the people coming west sense that they 'd never leave ? Why not go back to what they knew ? A certainty of weather , seasons that descended like ritual ? What promise drove them on ? Was any struggle worth it ? To stay alive . Bear children to increase the tribe . Some notion . Underneath that notion another surfaced , equal in weight : Someday they would each have to give up with grace . Continues ...
