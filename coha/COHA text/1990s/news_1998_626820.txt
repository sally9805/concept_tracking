<p> PEARLAND - A casual observer is tempted to ask what could be wrong in Pearland , where everything looks rosy from the outside . <p> South of Houston just inside the Brazoria County line , the city 's population has increased 200 percent since 1970 , schools have doubled since 1990 , new houses are popping up everywhere and the populace is increasingly young and affluent ( median age and income : 32 and $ 49,858 ) . <p> But beneath the glow of suburban upward mobility lies a viper 's nest of politics that seems to always revolve around the city manager , Paul Grohman , who 's been at the flash point of controversy since his arrival six years ago . <p> He is reviled by some for political skulduggery , revered by others as an economic development visionary . <p> In May , the City Council told him to take steps or " seek professional help " to address his " strong sense of insecurity . " <p> They ordered him to stop threatening to " stack " the council chambers with his supporters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to quit bringing a gun to City Hall , if reports that he packs a pistol are true . <p> Grohman 's marching orders , contained in a two-page letter , were extraordinary not only for their frank message , but because they were signed by the entire council , including some who are ardent Grohman supporters . <p> Two months later in July , after voters removed a Grohman supporter from the council , a more drastic measure was taken . Grohman 's $ 91,688 salary was reduced by $ 3,688 in a 3-2 vote . <p> The three councilmen who voted for the salary cut say they did it to convince Grohman , 43 , to change his ways . Thus far , they say they have n't seen much improvement . <p> To no one 's surprise , this has led to recriminations from Grohman supporters who showed up in droves last week at City Hall , some toting signs . <p> Grohman 's fans openly worry the latest turmoil engulfing City Hall could undercut the unprecedented prosperity that Pearland enjoys , but growth appears to be inevitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 288 that will contain about 10,000 housing units is on the drawing boards . It likely will be annexed by the ambitious city , which already has annexed about 5,000 acres the past three years . <p> In a few years , city planners predict Pearland 's estimated current population of 36,000 will top 50,000 . <p> " It 's following in the footsteps of Sugar Land , " observed Postmaster Chuck Kelly , who said his letter carriers are scrambling to deliver mail to an average of five new addresses each week . <p> While growth is up , the path taken by Grohman looks more like an up-and-down rollercoaster . <p> In 1993 , he was on the verge of being fired . By 1994 , he was riding high and landed a contract that some view as ridiculously generous and intentionally vague . Now , his job security appears shaky . <p> Local real estate brokers complain that Grohman 's wife , Gail , also a broker , has an unfair advantage over them because of her husband 's close ties to the Pearland Economic Development Corp. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to invest in the city . <p> Gail Grohman carries a city pager , but her husband has assured critics that he pays for the service . <p> But the most persistent complaint lodged against Grohman is his participation in partisan politics , something most city managers avoid . <p> Often in lockstep with Grohman is the Rev. Rick Scarborough , an evangelical firebrand who is pastor of Pearland 's First Baptist Church . <p> As has happened in the past , Scarborough came to Grohman 's aid when the council cut the city manager 's salary , sending a letter to the three council members who approved the pay cut . <p> " It appears to me . . . there has been a conspiracy to humiliate and harass our city manager until he resigns , " Scarborough wrote . <p> His willingness to intervene on behalf of Grohman may not be as significant as it once was . <p> In 1996 , Scarborough trumpeted in his book , " Enough Is Enough , " that besides the city manager and police chief , three members of City Council and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church . The book was published by the Rev. Jerry Falwell 's Liberty House Publishers . <p> Today , for a variety of reasons - including one councilmember who left because of term limits , another who lost re-election and another who moved out of town - no First Baptist church member holds an elected position . <p> Three school trustees who were church members have changed churches . Pearland school board vice president Glenn Garrison grew uncomfortable with the merging of politics and religion . <p> " I make my own political decisions , " said Garrison , who switched from First Baptist to another church . <p> Trustee Jim Watson says he does go to First Baptist , but is n't a member of the congregation . <p> Scarborough is n't deterred by either defections from his church or the reduced role of his church members on the school board and city council . <p> " It 's never been our agenda to control the city , " he said . <p> Nevertheless , Scarborough defends Grohman , describing him as a victim of forces that oppose progress . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't trust him and never will , unfortunately , " he said . " I do not believe Paul to be a perfect man , but he 's a good man . " <p> In the past , Grohman has defended his involvement in politics as his constitutional right . <p> If nothing else , his words and actions provide a stark contrast of the man . <p> In local weekly newspaper columns he once wrote , he was given to quoting the Bible and calling for more integrity in government . <p> At the same time , he concealed his own involvement in an aborted attempt by voters to recall his critics from the City Council . <p> The likelihood of telephone eavesdropping also is a fact of life at City Hall , where employees warn confidantes that their calls may be taped by a recording system that was installed as a reaction to a telephoned bomb threat . <p> The specter of Big Brother is not as far-fetched as it may sound after Grohman and the police chief were found to have a veritable library of their own taped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawsuit . <p> That sort of information , though , does n't faze Grohman 's supporters , who acknowledge he can be abrasive , but insist he is be best thing that 's ever happened to Pearland . <p> " You ca n't be everybody 's friend and really be a dynamic person . That 's my analysis of Paul Grohman 's personality problem , " said Stella Roberts , a devoted supporter who is vice president of the Pearland Economic Development Corp . " He 's assertive and some people would say he 's aggressive , but even this council would say this city is a better city than it 's ever been , and it would n't be where it 's getting without Mr. Grohman . " <p> Still , Grohman 's battles with city employees who do n't satisfy him , as well as his quick temper and propensity to threaten lawsuits , are constant grist for gossip . <p> " The guy just repulses me , " said Ben Best , a Pearland lawyer who is among the few private residents willing to criticize Grohman openly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's made it known he tapes other people 's calls . The man in imperious . He 's condescending and generally rude . " <p> When the city attorney resigned last March , she did n't leave before dropping a bomb in Grohman 's lap . <p> In a letter to City Council , Amy McCullough wrote that Grohman carried a gun to City Hall and " has spoken of shooting me on more than one occasion . " <p> McCullough , who declined an interview request after she resigned and was given a financial settlement with the city , told the council that Grohman solicited city employees to " fabricate a case against me . " <p> " Co-workers are afraid to step forward on my behalf , " she wrote . <p> Grohman is n't talking , refusing to return telephone calls from the Chronicle . But he still has an ace in the hole - a contract that includes a golden parachute that could force Pearland to pay him an estimated $ 250,000 in severance pay . <p> The background behind the contract is buried in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city of Pearland , Stella Roberts and her husband , Jack . <p> Joy Niday Colson , a former City Council member who contends she was the victim of a smear campaign that left her life in ruins , is appealing her lawsuit after federal and state judges ruled against her claims to be a victim of First Amendment retaliation . <p> Though her suit has been unsuccessful , the depositions , affidavits and telephone conversation transcripts it has generated reflect a rather unflattering portrait of Pearland politics . <p> It elicited a judicial sigh from a federal magistrate , who reviewed the case and described the behind-the-scenes maneuvering in Pearland as " an all too common breeding ground for lawsuits of this nature . " <p> Evidence in the lawsuit shows Grohman and Police Chief Mike Hogg feared they were going to be fired in 1993 and became intimately involved in launching a recall movement to oust Colson and two other council members they believed were after their jobs . <p> Grohman concealed his participation in the recall even though he was asked about it by at least one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> In a deposition , Grohman stated he did n't think his decision to order the police chief to research and write the first recall petitions was important because the recall was inevitable . <p> The recall movement , ostensibly based on charges of malfeasance and incompetency , failed after a judge ruled the petitions were based on charges that were too vague . <p> A grand jury also refused to indict the council members despite repeated attempts by either Hogg or Grohman to secure charges from Brazoria County prosecutors , Texas Rangers and the FBI . <p> Those attempts included an offer by Hogg to " deliver " 1,800 votes , purportedly from First Baptist Church members , in exchange for indictments , according to an affidavit signed by Tom Selleck , an assistant district attorney at the time who stated Hogg apparently believed he wanted to run for district attorney . <p> Selleck 's allegations are supported by an affidavit signed by John Blankenship , the chief investigator for the District Attorney 's Office . <p> Hogg denies the bribery allegation . <p> " My only goal was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . <p> Grohman and Hogg lobbied diligently for the indictments , prompting an exasperated response from Jim Maple , the district attorney in 1993 . <p> " You ca n't be politically protected , " a bemused Maple told Grohman in a recorded telephone conversation . " In other words , you know , if the voters or whoever it is that hired you do n't like you , for whatever reasons , I think you 're kinda out of luck . " <p> Even so , the campaign to save Grohman 's job was successful . <p> While the recall movement failed and criminal charges were never filed , voters who had been subjected to a barrage of allegations against Grohman 's critics ended up giving the city manager a firm majority on the council , which rewarded him with his current contract in 1994 . <p> The contract allows Grohman to collect two years salary and force the city to buy his house and pay him a relocation fee equal to 10 percent of his home 's value if he is terminated " without cause . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to termination without cause . <p> When council members Larry Wilkins , Bill Berger and Klaus Seeger voted last month to cut his salary , they essentially invited Grohman to take the money and run . <p> So far he has n't done that , and the council members say they do n't plan to fire him as long he makes positive changes . <p> " I just do n't know if he can really change , " said Wilkins , a 40-year-old optician . <p> The city manager 's contract states he is not entitled to his generous severance package if he receives two consecutive unsatisfactory annual reviews by the City Council - but it fails to spell out exactly what constitutes an unsatisfactory review . <p> " That 's what the courts would have to decide . It does n't bother me a bit in the world , " said Richard Tetens , a 64-year-old engineering consultant and Grohman supporter who is the only current council member who held office when the city manager 's open-ended contract was signed . <p> Besides Grohman 's contract , another oddity hanging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would take to fire the city manager . The new city attorney , Darrin Coker , is researching the question of whether it 's three votes or four votes because the City Charter is unclear . <p> Predictably , there is talk around Pearland that another recall of Grohman 's council critics , similar to events in 1994 , may be necessary to rescue the city manager . <p> " They 're trying to intimidate us , " said Seeger , a 48-year-old engineer who is the newest member of council . " It 's gon na get ugly here , no doubt about it . " <p>
