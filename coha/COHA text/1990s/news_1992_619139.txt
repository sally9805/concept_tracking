<p> Tiana Poston 's East Palo Alto neighborhood reverberates with police sirens and firearm explosions of gang violence and soured drug deals  --  hardly a place for a Girl Scout . <p> Or is it ? <p> From tough streets in East Palo Alto to housing projects in New York , the Girl Scouts of the U.S.A. is signing up new troops in some never-before visited places , including homeless shelters in Oakland , Philadelphia and Washington , D.C. ; teenage pregnancy clinics in San Francisco , and even a migrant labor camp in Texas . <p> " My neighborhood , it 's not all that good , " says Tiana , 11 , a sixth-grade student at Ronald McNair Intermediate School who was eager to join the Scouts . " It needs a lot of gardening and more things for the children . We need a better environment . There 's a lot of gangs and a lot of shootings . Sometimes it 's very scary . " <p> The Girl Scouts ' drive is dramatically changing its image from a proper and conservative volunteer association to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changing demographics and rising pressure to remain vital to society , the 80-year-old , nearly all-white organization began three years ago to seek registrations of multiethnic and troubled girls who were pregnant , homeless or too poor to pay the $ 4 annual fee , which the Girl Scouts subsidize . <p> " I think the organization just was n't attentive , " said Marie Rose Main , national executive director of Girl Scouts in New York . " What brought the change is the changing diversity in the population . The nation became more diverse in leadership and government with civil rights , and that was an influencing factor . " <p> Main said the outreach drive is a high priority for the organization : " If we are going to be a vital part of today 's society , then we must reach out and include all girls . " <p> The attempt to keep up with the times has distanced the Girl Scouts from the Boy Scouts of America  --  a separate organization widely viewed as its volunteering partner  --  at a time when Boy Scouts has come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls . <p> In the Bay Area , the United Way , which sponsors both groups , has been particularly critical of the Boy Scouts for banning homosexuals and has continuously held up the Girl Scouts as a model youth organization for its nondiscriminatory practices . <p> " They 're doing the kind of thing the United Way likes to support , providing services to those most in need , " said John Stafford , a United Way spokesman . " When older , traditional organizations are able to transform themselves and adapt to modern urban reality , that 's really meaningful . " <p> CONTEMPORARY NEEDS <p> Girl Scout recruiters sell new generations of teenage girls and parents on Girl Scouts 1990s-style by offering to guide them through the contemporary crises they face . <p> " This is not a white , middle class , **26;771;TOOLONG cookies organization anymore , " said Beverly Johnson , a special project organizer for the San Francisco Bay Girl Scout Council who recruits Girl Scouts and troop leaders in Oakland 's impoverished black neighborhoods . <p> Johnson is black and often uses this blunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell them , ' I know when you heard " Girl Scouts , " this is what you thought , but I 'm here to dispel the myth . ' " <p> Because of work by Johnson and others , recruiting programs in the Bay Area have resulted in new troops gathering in some unlikely places : <p> * Of the 24,341 girls registered as Bay Area Girl Scouts last year , about 400 were pregnant teenagers in a special program called From the Heart . Members meet monthly at pregnancy centers or in schools and learn about child care , as well participating in more traditional pursuits such as as retreats , campfires , cookouts and career exploration . <p> * Girl Scouts registered three new troops in homeless shelters in Hayward , Berkeley and Oakland , where girls of different ages  --  Daisies , Brownies and Cadets  --  participate in a structured program to build self-esteem and self- respect . <p> * About 100 girls in East Palo Alto have formed 12 troops and meet weekly , alternating typical Girl Scout activities with discussions about murder , gang violence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Last month 's rash of violent incidents spurred a 24 percent increase in Girl Scout membership . <p> * In Oakland and surrounding East Bay suburbs , an estimated 100 impoverished families have girls registered as Scouts . Girl Scouts recruited these new members from public schools that have Head Start programs for at-risk youth . <p> * At San Francisco 's Everett Middle School in the Mission District , Girl Scouts recruited 21 Hispanic Scouts this year for a role-model program , linking them to professional Hispanic women who act as mentors . <p> CHANGED PERCEPTIONS <p> " When I first walked in here , I thought of kids in green and brown dresses selling cookies , " said Janine Carlson , the Bay Area spokeswoman for the Girl Scouts , who started her job last month . " But its quite different from what you and I perceive as traditional Girl Scouting . " <p> Although Girl Scout activities still focus on the familiar cookie sales , camp retreats and badge- earning assignments , newer programs in the inner cities are unorthodox and loosely built around the special needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not sitting around knitting , " Johnson says . " People think that everyone in Girl Scouts bleeds green . Well , there are many ways to service people that still fit the traditional philosophy of helping others . " <p> Tiana Poston 's East Palo Alto troop learns more about public safety issues than would a regular Scout group . But like other troops , her group has taken field trips to art museums and a ballet performance . <p> " A problem for a lot of these kids is that they do n't know there are alternatives to the drugs and gang violence they see in the two or three blocks of their neighborhood , " said Cynthia Whatley , Tiana 's troop leader . " We have to show them they have choices . " <p> SURPRISED ADULTS <p> When the Girl Scouts came knocking on new Bay Area doors , they initially stunned the teachers , social workers and parents they approached . <p> Tina Lugo , the Hispanic mother of twin daughters who are Girl Scout Daisies , recalled her impression when a Scout recruiter showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were enrolled in the Head Start program : " I thought the Girl Scouts was for higher-income families . When I was growing up , we could n't afford it . She offered it at no cost . " <p> Pat Keehan , a teacher at the Hilltop Special Service Center , a San Francisco public school that serves 70 pregnant girls or young mothers ages 12 to 18 , was similarly surprised . <p> " When we heard Girl Scouts , we thought , ' With our teens ? No way ! ' " Keehan said . " We thought , ' These are hardly the Girl Scout type . ' These girls are pretty street- wise by age 12 . They just did n't fit the image . " <p> The program , however , was a success . <p> " The workshops were n't as important to them as the actual exposure to camp in the woods , " Keehan said . " Many of these girls had never even been over the Golden Gate Bridge . " <p> SPREAD TO SUBURBS <p> Dolores Reveles , a Bay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , said the new Girl Scouts are catching on in some multiethnic suburbs , in addition to inner-city areas . <p> On a recent weekday , high school teachers at Fremont High School and Carlmont High School in Belmont contacted Reveles about starting new troops . Many Hispanic students wanted to become Girl Scouts . <p> " The viewpoint is changing , " Reveles said . " More and more people are thinking they can be involved with Girl Scouts . "
