ALTHOUGH MANY YOUNG WOMEN OF CHILDBEARING age are treated for depression , no one is sure if it is safe for them to take their needed medication during pregnancy . A new study in the Journal of the American Medical Association provides a mixed answer . Researchers followed women who became pregnant while receiving therapy  --  either with Prozac , a relatively new and extremely popular drug , or tricyclic antidepressants , an older class of medication . Women in both groups bore the same small risk of having children with serious birth defects  --  which was no higher than it is for women in the general population . But both groups of women on antidepressant medication showed abnormally high rates of miscarriage . More study is needed to determine whether the medication or the depression could be bringing pregnancies to a premature end .
