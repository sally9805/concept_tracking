MY first wedding was Aunt Marcia 's second . I wore a straw hat with a baby-blue ribbon . The church was like an old schoolroom . Before the " I do , " before the kiss , I fainted away in the pew , and my mother carried me out the back door , rolling her eyes . <p> Queasy , I sat on the cement steps . " You 'd better not do that at your wedding , " my mother told me , and spat on a handkerchief to wash my face . I started to cry , because I was confused , and because I had lost my hat . My mother touched my tears with the corner of the handkerchief . " There , " she said , " that 's a little more appropriate . " When I got home , even before I unbuckled my patent-leather shoes , I opened the big blue dictionary and looked up " appropriate . " <p> MY friend Pamela liked to play Bride . She was usually the bride , since we played at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had wrapped her head in a bed sheet with lace doilies stapled to it . Her bouquet was green and red tissue paper . She wore her best dress-up clothes-orange beads , and a pink evening gown that trailed behind her . The only trouble was , she kept stepping on it in front . " This stupid thing , " she said as she walked down the hallway , while I sang " Here comes the bride " in my loudest , most celebratory voice . <p> " Hey , " I said as she approached the cardboard-box altar . " Your dress is n't white . " <p> " So ? " <p> I tried a different approach . " When can I be the bride ? " <p> " After I 'm the bride , " Pamela said , adjusting her veil . <p> I knew that this offer meant nothing . A second bride was no kind of bride . <p> " Do you take this man to be your awfully wedded husband ? " I said in a bored voice . <p> " I do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her fingers . <p> " Kiss the bride . " <p> Pamela kissed the air passionately . <p> After the kiss I stood at the altar , and Pamela looked at me . The bouquet dangled from her hand . I suddenly remembered . " Oh-throw the bouquet . " <p> She threw it , and I ran from the altar to pick it up . It withered in my clutch . Pamela 's ankle suddenly lopped sideways , and her foot fell out of the large shoe . <p> " What happens next ? " I asked . <p> SAM visited me in September , and I drove him to Rocky Mountain National Park . Sam wanted pictures of elk , bighorn sheep ; he wanted a mountain lion . I pulled the car over for every herd of animals . Sam jumped out with his point-and-shoot every time . He paused . The elk stared right at him . The bighorn sheep tossed its big head in Sam 's face . One after another , the animals stood still and then finally leaped away , disgusted , as Sam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We walked down the street in Estes Park with ice-cream cones . " My wife , " Sam said , " will be intelligent , educated , and ambitious-yet , " with a finger raised , " will want to have approximately five to seven children . " <p> " Bullshit , Sam , " I said , and hit his hand as if it were a tennis ball . A penny fell from the change in his grip , and he bent to pick it up . <p> " Does it work the same when it 's your penny ? " I asked . " Do you get good luck when you pick it up ? " <p> " No , but I 'll drop it again if you like . You can pick it up and get lucky . " He dropped it , and it made a cheap sound on the pavement . <p> I bent down to pick it up . It was shiny and new . When I straightened up , Sam held out his hand . I put my hand there , and he pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I dropped he called and said , " I 'm getting married . I 'm in love . We took a compatibility test and scored way high . " <p> She had the whole wedding planned in advance . Before she even met him . In a laminated pink notebook , with sketches and prices . All the songs , all the special readings by Kahlil Gibran . All she had to add was the initials on the napkins , the name on the cake . <p> So easy , so few decisions for him to make . He lucked out on a girl like that , I told him . <p> MY mother called me at my soon-to-be-old apartment the day that Johnny and I were moving in together across town . " The phone 'll be disconnected any minute , " I told her , kicking a wad of crumpled-up newspaper against the cabinet door . It bounced back to my toe , and I did it again . <p> " Do n't do it , do n't do it , " she said . She was crying . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already signed the lease . There 's a big orange moving truck outside . Johnny sprained his groin trying to lift the couch with the Hide-A-Bed . " <p> " But what will he think of you ? What will he think of me ? " <p> " Mom , he does n't even know you . " " Put him on the phone . " <p> I argued , but she was silent until I handed the phone to Johnny , who was sweating , holding an empty canary cage . " Yes , I understand . Yes .... No .... No .. No . .. Yes . " He handed the phone back , and I asked my mother , " Okay , what did you say ? " " None of your beeswax . " <p> After we hung up , I asked Johnny what she had said , and he said , " I could n't begin to tell you , " But he put his sweaty arm around my shoulders and told me that he would pack the rest of the truck himself . That I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I had any doubts , to tell him today . <p> ALCOHOL was served , champagne wreathed with cool white cloth napkins , although this bride was a Seventh-Day Adventist . We knew her through Johnny 's job . The day was cold and misty , but heat blowers had been installed in the tents . As I walked too close past one of them , it mangled my stockings in one hot blow . I looked down at the strings of mesh , fused together in thin snakes . Johnny laughed and offered me his pants . <p> A young couple stood at the cake table , drinking nonalcoholic champagne . The woman , who had glasses and a frumpy haircut , smiled a lot . She wore a long angora sweater dress with a matching cardigan draped over her shoulders . Hey , I thought , you 're my age . You ca n't do that . <p> She said , " I do n't know . This champagne does n't taste nonalcoholic . It 's just a little too convincing . " " I do n't care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it says it is . " <p> I concentrated on standing upright on the wet earth . But my spike heels sank into the mud , and my shoes kept getting stuck . <p> " Our wedding had no champagne , " the wife said . " So you could n't get them mixed up , nonalcoholic and alcoholic champagne . We just did n't serve any . Just coffee , tea , like that . " <p> " Are you an alcoholic ? " I asked . " Certainly not , " she said . <p> I was thinking about the word " certainly " and how I rarely heard it in conversation anymore . Then I realized that they probably could n't drink because of their religion , and I slapped my forehead with my palm , while my heels dove into the ground again . <p> " Mosquito ? " the husband asked politely . She was a marketing manager , and he was an accountant . They worked for the same company , and had been married since they were both nineteen . " And you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Part-time sometimes , temporary other times . " <p> " Who are you here with ? " <p> I pointed to Johnny with the bottom of my champagne glass . At that moment he was showing a woman how he could click his heels together in the air . The woman laughed and applauded . Some mud splattered on her shin from the heels of his shoes . I said , " Johnny there . I live with him . " " Ah , " the husband said . " You 're married to Johnny . " " No . I live with him . " <p> They nodded . The wife said , " Well , then , " and brushed her husband 's shoulder . Her long nails made scraping noises on the tightly woven cloth . They moved together toward a couple under a dripping tree . " Oh , Seth , Marie , " the wife said . <p> I stood alone again , holding my glass in my hand . After all , I was what I said I was . <p> JOHNNY and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big white shirt and no tie , and I wore a kimono . Nobody talked to us , but a big band was playing , so we drank a lot of wine and headed toward the floor . First we tried a polka , then a jitterbug , then a tango . Johnny pushed me into a bridesmaid 's bare back , and I stepped backward , detaching her foot from its satin pump . " I 'm sorry , " I told her , and whispered to Johnny , " Why ca n't you lead worth a damn ? " <p> I walked outside . Standing in front of me was a statue of Hiawatha , with Minnehaha in his arms . Her dress hung in strips , and his biceps barely bulged under her weight . <p> I heard Johnny walk up behind me . " See that ? " I pointed to the statue . " Is that how it 's supposed to be ? " I turned around , but it was n't Johnny , it was Sam , the groom . <p> " Yeah , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get . " We looked through the window at the wedding guests , and at Johnny dancing with the bride . They were beautiful , the whites blurring together , the bride ringing on his arm like a giant bell . They could have been any two people that you had seen once and forgotten . <p> BUT it would n't feel like a wedding if we drove to Vegas and got married by an Elvis impersonator , " I said , holding a spatula . " We could act like it did n't mean anything . " In the pan the eggs chugged like a motor . <p> " Do you really want to get married in Las Vegas ? " Johnny asked , next to the stove . <p> " No , " I said , confused . " No , I do n't really want to get married . " <p> " Good . Me neither . After Sally , I promised myself never again . " <p> " What if you think about wanting to marry me and I think about wanting to marry you ? And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'll promise not to do it . " <p> " But I do n't want to . " <p> " Even with me ? " <p> " What are you talking about ? You hate all this . What is it that you want ? The wedding part ? " <p> " No . I could n't stand to be around my family for a whole day . " Do you want to be <p> " Do Everyone would to be name . Get fat . " <p> " No . Everyone would ex " Just me to take your last name . Get fat . " " Everyone who ? " <p> " Just everyone . " <p> I had meanwhile flipped the eggs for the second time , so the yolks were face up and coated with a doughy white film . Johnny turned the burner knob to OFF . <p> I looked around the yellow kitchen , with yellow linoleum peeling at the edges . " I hate yellow , " I said . <p> " Well , that 's what you get when you rent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love you . I do n't know what you 're asking me for . " <p> " I want to be that important . " " To whom ? " I started crying , sliding the eggs from the pan onto a plate . They had sat too long in the hot pan and were now rigid , even the yolks . <p> " I want you to want me like that . I want you to love me that much . As much as you loved Sally . " Johnny ran his fingers through his short hair and looked at me blearily . " It was n't about love with Sally . It was about marriage . It was never about love . " " I still want you to love me that much . " He looked at the plate and then at my face . His voice was scorched and halting . " Do you love me that much ? " he asked . <p> I INTRODUCED Nancy and Gary at an informal wedding reception . Nancy was Johnny 's co-worker , one of those embarrassing guests who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wispy hair and permanently flared nostrils . He had once followed me home telling me about his pet lizards . <p> They talked at the buffet table for two hours , after the reception had moved outdoors , after the keg had burped its last . Nancy flushed red . Her voice became even louder , her shoulders even wider . She 's in love , I thought , and turning into a man . <p> Nancy finally left after saying good-bye for thirty minutes . Gary stayed , holding an empty plastic cup . " Go after her , " I whispered , and he hesitated until he saw her brake lights ignite in the parking lot . Then he ran toward her , waving with both arms . <p> Gary called me the next day . I had been up all night , and had a purple crescent under each of my eyes . Johnny was still in the bathroom , crying . " I was thinking of asking Nancy to coffee , " Gary said . <p> No , not coffee . A date . Say the word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said . " Bring flowers . Kiss her good-night , with tongue . " He repeated everything . Date . Flowers . A kiss . In the next room Johnny had emerged from the bathroom and was dividing our books into stacks . He got The Great Gatsby . I got Anna Karenina . Romeo and Juliet we gave away , since in that one both of them died . GARY told me about his engagement over a hot cup of coffee . The windows were steaming in the coffee shop , and I drew little animals in the mist on the windowpane while he talked . <p> When Gary proposed to Nancy , it was raining , but he had planned a picnic , so they spread a blanket and sat on a curb . The chicken had gotten soggy , but the potato salad could be saved . He handed her a small white box . Nancy started crying . When she saw that the box contained a pendant , not a ring , she cried harder . <p> That night they called their parents . His hooted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receiver from across the room . Her parents were quiet . They said , " Oh . " When she got off the phone , Gary asked , " How did they feel ? " <p> Nancy said , " They said , Oh . " ' <p> Gary slept all night , but Nancy walked back and forth in the moonlight . When the sun came up , he said , she was still waiting by the window . He woke up , and she looked at him with her red-rimmed eyes and said , " Okay , I 'm ready for it . " <p> " Ready for it ? " I asked , suddenly looking away from the window . <p> " Yeah , I guess she meant that she was okay with the idea , " Gary said . <p> " Is that what she meant ? " <p> " I did n't ask , " he said . " Who knows what anyone thinks anyway ? " PLAYED piano at a Presbyterian wedding , for a friend of a friend . The piano was good , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The stained glass was blue . <p> They looked at each other and cried through the service . They choked on their vows . They said , " Yes , I will . " I cried too as they clutched each other and kissed and kissed and kissed . AT Nancy and Gary 's wedding reception Johnny and I did the wave-salute at each other from our respective tables . He had brought a date ; she was blonde , drunk , and kissing him . I had no date , but my stomach was the flattest it had ever been . <p> Johnny asked me to dance . I pulled close to him and smiled at his date . <p> " I think she 's the one , " he said . " The one what ? " I asked . <p> " You.know , " he said . But I didn't-not really . I left him alone in the middle of the dance floor and asked someone else to dance . He said no , so I asked someone else . He also said no , looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me at my abandoned table . " Do you want to dance ? " " No , " I said . " I want nothing . " <p> " Look at her , " he said , and pointed to his bride . So I did . Her dress was enormous-she was packed in like a lace sausage . She thumped someone on the back so hard that his hors d'oeuvre flew out of his hand and dropped to the floor . <p> " I love her , " Gary said . " I love her completely . My love for her is complete . " <p> And it was . Complete . And I was n't . Completely . Relief and fear tangled together , like the hands of women clutching in the air for a falling bouquet of something . * <p> Sidebar
