I am a seagull-no , that 's not it . I am an actress . <p> - Anton Chekhov <p> I want to be alone . <p> - Greta Garbo <p> I. How Not to Dress <p> A pair of brown velvet slacks , one leg cut against the bias so that it shone a deeper hue and slenderized the left hip without diminishing the right , but looked great under strobe light . Brown strappy sandals with a spiked , wood-look heel purchased on discount from the Pump Room , where my best friend had worked up a great sales record by caressing the ankles of middle-aged women as he slipped on their pricey loafers and spectators . A Chorus Line T-shirt , brown on cream , with a string of dancers stretched across my chest , the leggy star 's posture distorted by one newly developed breast , the married couple 's hands clenched tightly over the other and knotted at the nipple . At my neck , a homemade brown velvet choker with one of my of my mother 's prize ivory earrings stabbed into its bow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught up in an asymmetrical bun and tied with a coarse brown shoestring . <p> * <p> She wants to be an actress , my mother explained to her friends , when I crossed their path in the entryway . They were not sympathetic . <p> " Why not just go the whole hog and study up to be a wood nymph ? " one said . <p> " You know , Sandy , you 'll get enough of that later on when you start dating . " <p> They were sturdy , ironic women : schoolteachers with distinctive laughs and all  --  purpose wardrobes : the volleyball coach with the potty mouth and the perpetual pair of culottes ; the history buff with her unfiltered cigarettes and shag cut , crates of movie stills and sixties albums stacked up in her homeroom ; the English teacher sporting classic tailored blouses , gap teeth , and tennis elbow . My mother was their queen , the first divorcee in the school system . Every Friday they 'd pack their apples and cream cheese sandwiches and take off for the matinee . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd say , as they tramped out the door , my mother 's glossy raincoat brushing my bare calf and a script of illegible smoke signals trailing behind them . * <p> Alone in the mod condo we 'd bought when my dad went through his life change , I examined all the makeup in the medicine cabinet . But I longed for more exotic thrills than my mother 's sensible collection would allow : blue mascara , purple lipstick , metallic eggplant eye shadow . She 'd told me I should n't wear makeup at all , that I had a beautiful skin to begin with , and I 'd only ruin it with all that extra . She claimed she only indulged because of the Pill , which had marked her face with a fine mask of sunspots-nothing more sinister than a healthy cover of freckles , if you had n't known better . When she was a girl , in fact , her face had been completely open sierra , pride  --  of-the-prairie , like mine . <p> But then I looked in the mirror and remembered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oddly enough , my mother loved that one , and had raised a stink when a photographer tried to airbrush it away in a close-up we 'd done for my junior high graduation . I turned my head so that it did n't show . I had a face that should only be looked at from the side , never straight on . I had to remind myself . Her face is her fortune . Her fortunate fate . The face that launched a thousand ships . Sentences from books I 'd read over and over . I turned my eyes up , then down . I ran a finger along the outline of my cheek . I tried to tell the future . * <p> They say that Greta Garbo 's face had no bad angles , but she looked like a different woman in every shot . A barely insinuated cleft in the chin . A needle-fine , but sizable nose . Wide , expressive lips . Gaps between several of the front teeth , narrowed in Hollywood . Eyes . Eyelids . Cheekbones . Eyes . <p> But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mirror . <p> She was born in Stockholm in 1905 , Greta Gustafsson , the flower of seven generations of rural peasant stock . Her father was a street sweeper and gifted amateur singer who died of kidney trouble when Greta was fourteen . Erratic financial support came from Uncle Jack , a taxi driver . Her first shorts were promotional films for Bergstrom 's , the department store where she began her working life at age fifteen . A supervisor , recognizing her talent , promoted Greta from the millinery department to women 's ready-to-wear , where she prospered . <p> * <p> " Miss Gustafsson. . . always looks clean and well groomed and has such a good face . " <p> * <p> The face was n't divine at first . In early photos , it looks alternately : too round , too crowded , too broad in the chin . The kinky hair clouds the outlines . The crooked teeth give the smile a comic cast and Miss Gustafsson looks every syllable her name-a parody of a strong Swedish milkmaid-sturdy , willing , but of dubious intelligence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the most sophisticated actresses of a generation . <p> In How Not to Dress , Greta loses herself in the logistics of a reversible riding habit . She fumbles with the buttons . She flashes on and off in her goofy gap-toothed smile . An earlier version is more plot-oriented . In Top to Toe , the family home has been razed by a fire . Instead of despairing , mama , papa , and childer descend on Bergstrom 's in a carnival spirit . They will get themselves a new wardrobe out of the ordeal . Miss Gustafsson shows her legs and smiles . Everyone buys . Everything is delivered . <p> * <p> I want to come out of the divorce like that , dressed in a wardrobe my father has never seen , one that my mother would n't be caught dead in . I reach down and pull the bottom of my T-shirt up through the neck to make a halter . I paint some rouge onto the mirror , then rub my face in it , keeping my promise never to mar my features @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Devil <p> To get the part , I have to do somersaults on stage . Really . Then a dash up and down the orchestra pit , a reading of a clean limerick , and an improvisation based on Hansel and Gretel . It 's not until callbacks that I get my hands on the script , which turns out to be an early play by Woody Allen . I 'm reading for the part of the ingenue , a tourist from New Jersey who ca n't quite figure out what she wants in a man until she meets up with a befuddled diplomat in an Eastern Bloc American embassy . She makes a lot of long speeches filled with ellipses and run-ons . I fill the gaps with gestures I 've learned from watching the Matinee Club imitate the home ec . teacher . <p> My best friend , Kerry , gets the part of my father-a coincidence that fills me with mystic 8-ball awe . He reads the lines in an exaggerated , campy style and takes great pleasure in finding an Ugly American wardrobe from thrift stores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ racks for dinner jackets and tuxedos to wear with our designer jeans . <p> But the real sleeper is the male lead-a blond wrestler who shows up with a motorcycle helmet and plays dumb so convincingly that he fascinates the whole crowd . He blinks his long , rabbity eyelashes in the spotlight . He acts with his arms , bare even in the heart of February , so I can see the muscles flinch with every lurch of the plot . He has trouble with the lines . I ca n't believe no one 's noticed that Todd 's too beautiful to play Woody Allen . <p> Meanwhile , Mr. Morris the director tells my mother and all her friends he thinks I 'm beautiful . But , when we 're blocking at the early rehearsals , he lets me know , in front of the whole cast , that I walk like a duck , my dark roots are showing , and I do n't know how to kiss . <p> " Melt , " he says . " You 're in the throes of passion , you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just been woken up in the middle of the night out of an erotic dream , and you 're supposed to let your torso melt into his . Sandy , what 's the matter , hon ? Have n't you ever been kissed before ? You look like you 're playing the little teapot , not a healthy American girl . " <p> * <p> Backstage , Kerry teaches me how to walk with my heels farther apart , how to apply Sun-In with more precision and substitute a powerful hair dryer for the sun 's rays . He demonstrates a ball change , for quick changes of direction on stage . He mimics my lines so that they jostle and jiggle , sloshed over with emphasis and implication . When he shows me how to melt , his face goes slack , his hipbone digs into mine , and I smell the jade green frisson of his cologne . <p> * <p> It was Max Stiller , a prominent Swedish director , who created Garbo as we know her today . He was a former actor himself , a handsome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risky business negotiations . He cultivated a collection of elaborate antique waistcoats and an obsession with beautiful women with whom he was never known to become romantically involved . While Greta was still attending the Royal Dramatic Theatre Academy , Stiller cast her in The Saga of Gosta Berlin , g , warning that she would have to lose twenty pounds for the role . He conducted long arguments with the camera man over Greta 's best angles and made her repeat scenes until she cried . He then escorted her into high society , told her what to say and how not to dress . She called him Moje . He called her Garbo . That is to say grace in Spanish . Wood nymph in Norwegian . Divine on any tongue . <p> * <p> " Tell Miss Gustafsson that in America , men do n't like fat women , " the American movie mogul commented to Stiller , as they planned the break to Hollywood . <p> * <p> The somersault turned out to be more than a whim . At one point , I had to maneuver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hero to tumble over a hard sofa arm . Lucky me . Todd had to actually dive over the back . Every time we did it , I had a moment of panic , as if I was going to roll off the stage . It was similar to the moment of the stage kiss . In both cases , I went into a dark place where I lost all sense of orientation . There was the earthy smell of Todd 's sweat , like my father 's old running shorts in the bottom of the laundry hamper , his hand on my lower back , the crick in my neck , the furball in the pit of my stomach . Then he 'd pat me further down and I 'd jump , leap , catapult back into the clutch of my own skin . Later , Todd started a rumor that I was a little too aggressive with my tongue , and Kerry said I 'd finally get to start dating after all . <p> * <p> " You know that when you blow out the match . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a revolutionary love scene , Greta Garbo and John Gilbert in Flesh and the Devil , close up , for at least five minutes and illuminated only by the match they hold between them . They were flesh and blood lovers by that time , or so MGM would have its audiences believe . Gilbert was a film idol , a frustrated director whose education had halted at the edge of eighth grade . Garbo was a rising star , traumatized by her loss of Stiller , who failed in Hollywood and returned to Sweden alone to die six months later of tuberculosis . Gilbert taught Garbo to play tennis and took her out on long jaunts with his roommate , all of them dressed alike as handsome bachelors . Greta repeatedly refused to marry him and called herself a bachelor for the rest of her life . <p> * <p> " Wife is such an ugly word . " <p> * <p> After rehearsals , Kerry and I would go to my house where he 'd hint around that he wanted to go sit on the sun porch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my father had left behind . Afterwards , we 'd supplement what we 'd drunk with water from the tap , as if we really believed that the old man would come back some day to reprimand us , and as the spring wore away at the alcohol content , our evenings got longer , our highs more expansive , and our conversations more philosophical . <p> Kerry told me what he thought was gross : <p> French kissing <p> Marijuana joints <p> Waking up in the same clothes you went to bed in <p> I told him the things I 'd never do : <p> Take the Pill <p> Really dye my hair <p> Sleep with someone unless I wanted to <p> " Oh , you already do , girl . You 're just frigid as hell . " <p> I kicked at his ribs with my spike heel . " No , I 'm not . Besides , that 's a contradiction in terms . If I want to sleep with someone I 'm not frigid . And vice versa . " <p> He grabbed my ankle and started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so cold it made my teeth ache and the blades of my shins sting , but it felt good too , and I concentrated on not pulling my leg away . " Not necessarily . Everyone wants to . It just means you might want to , but you ca n't enjoy yourself . " <p> " I always enjoy myself just fine , thanks " I said . The glass was soaking into me , was becoming part of my leg , part of the slope of conversation , part of Kerry 's lap . Maybe this was what Mr. Morris meant by melting . <p> " That wrestler chump really bothers you , does n't he ? " <p> " I 'm just worried he 's going to forget his lines in the middle of a performance . What would you do ? " <p> " I do n't know , San . A diva 's only as good as her last leading man . " <p> " Thanks a lot , " I said , and we heard the front door jostle on its hinges . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " She should 've bounced him out on his balls . " <p> " She should 've skipped the face lift and gone for the ski lift . " <p> Then I heard my mother 's voice , scraped dry with tears and cigarettes . " It 's just so sad , " she said , and I felt the budding hangover beneath my hairdo blossom like a cabbage rose . <p> III . Garbo Talks <p> Then there was the problem of delivery . I could n't project past the twelfth row . Mr. Morris had his assistant testing it for me . Whenever I heard my voice on the tape recorder , I thought it was someone else-the time and temperature lady , the mouse on my favorite cartoon , the timid female voice on the phone that used to shed excuses down to its very last fiber then ask for my father during the middle of the afternoon . It was n't an ugly voice ; in fact , there was something attractive in its timbre : a twist , a curving inward , a verbal blush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own lines , especially when Kimber caught them on tape , fast forwarding and reversing , flashing her elbows and pressing her lips together , isolating the words like guppies in plastic baggies . <p> " You think you know what you want . " <p> " You think you know . " <p> " You think you want . " <p> Kimber stopped the tape again . " What ? " she said , so that the word echoed on both ends . Her hands pulled at her long rumpled hair and her thin nostrils dilated . The tail of her men 's dress shirt rode up over her hips as she squared her knobby shoulders and tried to track my career . <p> * <p> It was a convention by then : Garbo made her appearance almost a quarter of the way into the film , just as the viewer 's anticipation was paling . Then it reasserted itself at the moment of impact , a raw craving for some essential beauty , like the yen for raw beets and carrots the actress exhibits in Ninotchka , and which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> * <p> " What ? I ca n't hear her . Is she trying to be an actress or a seagull ? I do n't hear the gravel in her gullet , Moje . " Kimber ran the tape backward again without dimming the sound . There was a blip and gush , a shriek and caw of cellophane that made my eardrums quiver . <p> " Yakablom . Yakablom to you too , " she said , and I laughed along . " There 's your doppelganger , your demon voice , you ought to try it sometime , kid . What did you read for try-outs ? I did The Seagull but Aaron-Mr . Morris-thinks it 's maudlin . His taste is more Neil Simon-y . Mistaken identities , hairbrain schemes , light romantic comedy . It makes me want to weep . I can really weep , you know , real professional tear-jerker quality . Anytime I want . " <p> And she started in , her whimpers bleeding imperceptibly into actual moans . Real tears manifested in the corners of her eyes . Pencil rimmed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a point of teaching myself to cry without making any noise at all , sitting stock still on the sun porch , staring out the window and clutching a sofa pillow . I 'd hold the sound in until I felt the shallows of my face solidifying , the look congealed at last . But now it turned out that was n't the way to be an actress after all . <p> * <p> When it comes to Anna Christie the effect is doubled : Garbo has made her name in silent pictures filled with long close-ups and placard ellipses : " You are . . . so beautiful " " You are . . . so young . " Galloping horse hooves kick her name up out of the sand ; trains spark its syllables through the rails ; she has no need to speak up for herself . But now Garbo must raise her voice in the service of technology . The posters for the movie concentrate on this singular fact : " Garbo Talks . " <p> * <p> " Are you all right ? " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ale on the side . . . and do n't be stingy , baby . " she said , in a coarse , spiky accent , her face suddenly drawn tight , her eyes dilated and focused somewhere behind my shoulder . " Who 's that ? Who 's that ? " <p> I thought she was hallucinating , her eyelids flickering in an REM tattoo . Then I realized she was asking me something-a quiz , a joke , a riddle . <p> " Who ? " <p> " Do n't you know ? She does n't remeber , Moje . It 's the Divine Garbo . Those are the first lines she ever said on film . They say I look like her . I 'm supposed to have her cheekbones , no ? <p> * <p> The effect was fabulous : throaty , chocolate , erotic , deep-salted , divine . John Gilbert 's career plummeted when his high-pitched whine shattered his screen image . But Garbo 's voice veiled her face , coated and saturated the picture , safe-sealed the mystery . <p> * <p> I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cast called her the Kook , the Kook-umber , or the Kook-Under , and avoided her at all costs . She seemed older than the rest of us , her features deeper , her odors darker , her vocabulary more pronounced . She showed up at rehearsals with movie magazines and paper bags full of odd snacks-a pickled green tomato , a sardine sandwich , a butcher 's package of smoked herring . Her curly reddish hair looked oily under a series of hats and berets . In conversation , she salted her speech with allusions to movies and actors no one had ever heard of before . The men 's dress shirts she wore over jeans or dark trousers were thin enough that you could tell she did n't have a bra on , and underneath , her baseball breasts stood wide-set and stolid on her chest . Once when she rolled up a sleeve , I looked up its huge arm hole and saw a thick spiral of light red hair , like a sea sponge waiting to expand . <p> " She 's a narc , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our kiss and he patted me on the backside , as he did more and more often now that he was beginning to memorize his lines . " No one our age would wear a hat like that . " <p> " She 's Mr. Morris 's love interest , " the plump girl who played my mother confided . <p> " No , she 's just a fashion disaster , " Kerry said . " Come on Sandy , let me fix your hair . " <p> * <p> In Garbo 's first scene , she stares across the table at an old woman in men 's clothes . Both characters are ragged , exhausted , well on their way to being drunk . Garbo 's beauty is shaded by a hat and a hangover . She wears a string tied around her neck , a ruffled blouse , a frown plaited into her forehead . <p> Marthe , the wharf rat , meets her gaze . <p> " I know who you are , " Anna Christie says . " You 're me in forty years . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough : Kimber was a transfer student who had lost her parents in transit . Just after she got settled in our school , the Air Force shot her father off on Temporary Duty Elsewhere and her mother spiraled into some personal crisis that sent her through a series of institutions and rehab centers . That left Kimber alone in her senior year of high school , three months to graduation . Mr. Morris had figured out she was flying solo when he pulled into his driveway one January night and saw the open door of the house next door . A girl was swinging on the newel post on the front porch , dressed in a sheet with a men 's tie knotted around her waist . Her body was illuminated in the porch light , its peaks and ridges as defined as if she were nude . He remembered thinking she looked like the Columbia Studio muse , the unreconstructed one , before the fat censors took an eraser to it , and then he wondered whether he 'd really done it this time , he 'd stayed too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those sex-infused hallucinations . He parked and picked up his gym bag , and went in for a closer look . <p> * <p> " The Grand Hotel . People come , people go , nothing ever happens . " <p> The movie opens with wide shot of a switchboard , showing us the potential for crossed wires and missed connections . We can find its analogue in the spiral stairwell of the Grand Hotel , a huge cutaway wedding cake of plot . <p> " I wonder if anyone ever jumps ? " the Baron says , leaning in toward Joan Crawford . <p> " I do n't know . Why do n't you try it and see ? " <p> * <p> When Mr. Morris got closer , the girl stooped , as if suddenly exhausted , sat down on the porch , and shucked off her ballet slipper . Then she rubbed its toe against her cheek , so Aaron-Mr . Morris-could almost feel the texture of the waxed ballroom floor against his ten o'clock shadow . He watched her kiss the slipper 's underside , then take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railing . She paused for a moment , watching it balance . He saw his breath move . <p> * <p> Across town , my father is holding a business meeting in the lounge of the Plaza Suite . His drink is dry and the potential buyer has offered to refill it , but the guy 's not being aggressive enough at the bar , standing there chatting up a woman in a black studded halter instead of concentrating on getting the bartender 's attention Once more , Dad has the opportunity to regret the intrusion of disco into the more respectable hotels . He rolls the ice around in the glass like the dice in a crap game . His video lottery franchise is flourishing , buckets full of silver every afternoon . The flash color of rainbow trout he 'd be hauling into his early retirement . But only if he can manage this merger . The woman shifts so that he can see up the hollow of her armpit . Jackpot . A nickel shot of nipple . Without even trying , as usual . <p> * <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we took our Private Lives duet acting entry to the state forensics tournament , we stayed overnight in the Capitol Holiday Inn . After Mr. Morris gave us the mutual respect speech and locked himself in his room with his gym bag , we went for a late night swim with some of the competition , then padded around the halls on bare feet , no cover-ups , feeling like the exhibitionists we were trying to become . The hotel was a theme park of adulthood . A bird cage took up one entire wall of the lobby , showcasing parrots and toucans , some of whom actually called " Toss the crackers , cookie " and " Sock it to me , sailor " at us as we passed . When an indoor cafe appeared at the end of the atrium , umbrellas and tables set up on astro turf , we landed at an abandoned table and rehearsed our roles , ad-libbing to meet the situation , and there was a sharp chlorine smell in my nostrils , a sticky glow over Kerry 's rough-complected winter tan that made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or broken , and remembering this night . Then we went back to one of the rooms and sat against a wall , watching two of our friends make out on the tacky brown and orange queen-size bedspread . <p> " An eight for poise and presentation , " I said . <p> " A ten for expressiveness . Did you see the size of that boner ? " <p> " Ow , what are you doing ? " <p> " Checking your qualifications , San . " <p> * <p> Just as Mr. Morris became convinced the girl was going to expose herself , he power  --  walked up the front steps , holding both hands over his head , then realized that he 'd watched too many movies and let them sink back into his pockets . His gym bag still sat like a penitent dog in the driveway : who 's to know what 's inside ? <p> " Are you all right ? " he said . " I 'm Aaron Morris , from next door . I teach at the high school , I think I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threw her head back and tucked her bare feet under the sheet . But she did n't get up off the porch . " Strange man , strange man do n't look at me . " <p> " I , ah , I do n't want to intrude , but are the folks around ? You know , the administrators , the producers , the payroll department , the sponsors ? " <p> " I wo n't lie to you . I 'm here alone . I 'm depending on the kindness of strangers . You can do whatever you want to me . " Her voice was strange : hoarse , fatalistic , demanding , like no teenage girl he 'd heard after ten years in the business . He felt his own throat close . <p> " Right now I just want to get you in out of the cold . " <p> * <p> Garbo 's role opposite Baron Barrymore looks like deliberate typecasting . By this point , she 's reached that dangerous curve in her career where she 's suddenly able to parody herself a rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cast them either . Once she steps out of the tutu and slips back into the adoring men 's dressing gown , she 's herself again , vamping from one hotel room to another , uniquely anonymous . You might say Garbo lived her life as if it were a series of movie flats and hotel rooms . She did n't take the time to accumulate furniture or husbands , never entertained , rarely answered the phone . Her apartment in the Campanile Building was marked with a simple " G " , the doormen neither affirmed nor denied her presence , and three of her seven rooms were permanently blocked off . At actual hotels , she registered under an alias : <p> Miss Karin Lind <p> Miss Jane Emerson <p> Miss Emily Clark <p> Miss Mary Holmquist <p> Miss Gussie Berger <p> and the favorite : Miss Harriet Brown . <p> * <p> I was the only kid in my group who lived in an apartment , as I called it , since I could n't pronounce " condominium " without stumbling over the " condom " part , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how you looked at it . I tried to see myself as a New Yorker in one of Woody Allen 's movies , although our furniture was far too plump and crowded for that , and I suspected he 'd never approve of the white plastic dinette set with sunflower cushions or the farmer 's market still life in the hall . For my mother , the condominium was the fulfillment of a girlhood fantasy of living like a bachelorette . The minute they got the separation , she went out and bought it , said she was n't going to give the old bluffer the chance to back out now . The compact dishwasher , the laundry chute under the bathroom sink , the fold-out ironing board were amazing to her : I often caught her opening and closing them rhythmically , her mahogany wedge haircut bobbing in the draft , and I only wished he could see how she looked then . <p> But our new living quarters did mean that I heard everything that went on , whether I wanted to or not . And one night while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its nasty nail polish zest , I switched off my blow dryer to listen to Mr. Morris describing the scene in Kimber 's house once he finally got her inside . Candy wrappers and movie magazines all over the floor , male and female clothing draped over the chairs and sofas , a strong odor of sauerkraut in the air . When he went back into the kitchen , he found that the gas stove was on , though all the pots in the house seemed to be stacked up on the counter and the refrigerator contained only a bottle of cheap vodka , a package of radio batteries , a few stalks of celery and a half  --  empty jar of jalapeno jelly . <p> " The girl was trying to off herself , " he told my mother-Marlene , let 's call her . <p> " Do n't be dramatic , Aaron . If she was really serious , then why was the door open ? " <p> " Maybe she ran out of nerve . Anyway , I 've been keeping an eye on her . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . It 's more kosher , do n't you think ? " <p> " It 's always more kosher for the woman to carry the extra weight . That 's why we 've got the stretch marks . " <p> " Marlene , did I ever tell you you 're a living doll ? " <p> * <p> When her last lover , George Schlee , died of a heart attack in the Crillon Hotel in Paris , Garbo panicked , packed , and left without notifying the authorities . His wife , who bore a striking resemblance to the film star and had tolerated the affair in a dignified manner up to a certain point , never spoke to Garbo again . She had her New York apartment exorcised of " the vampire 's " presence . That 's why it 's not surprising to see Greta sweep out the door in her fur , without even accounting for the Baron 's corpse . <p> * <p> So Kimber moved her movie posters in with us . She packed her car with three paper bags of clothes , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of jalepeno jelly and peanut butter cups which she hoarded under my bed , and brought out for special occasions . The vodka she left at home , but we made commando trips in whenever we needed fortifications . She slept on the daybed in my room and I watched her twist in the sheets , throw a leg over a pillow , wind the covers over her head , mutter into the Hollywood headboard , get up and bring a sardine sandwich back to bed . My mother , who had her own mysterious bouts of insomnia , would look in at the door , bobbing her tea bag in a cup of hot water , and wink at something over my head . <p> * <p> " There 's always another Grand Hotel . " <p> V. Garbo Dies <p> It happens in an opera box at the theatre . But it could be anywhere : two girls sitting in a bedroom , a beauty parlor , a carriage . One must be darker than the other .

She had my Glamour draped over her knee and I was leaning on my elbows over her yellowed copy of Photoplay . The strong smell of must gave the chocolate a fishy taste , but I still let it melt in my mouth as long as possible , while I mulled into the core of the gossip-would Garbo ever marry John Gilbert , were her feet and her salary really as huge as they claimed ? <p> " I do n't know how you can read this rubbish , " Kimber said . One side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since she insisted on reading in semi-darkness , and I wondered whether it was true , as one photographer swore , that Garbo had such a fine sense of the camera that she could actually feel light and shadow on her skin . <p> " What ?

Let 's shake rehearsal and take my car down there , just us two bachelors . My treat . All you have to do is think of something to tell that strange man . " <p> I had two feelings about Kimber : one was embarrassment , and the other admiration . When she dropped me off to meet my friends at the disco where I 'd flash the fake I.D . Kerry had made for me , join the boys drinking gin and tonic , the girls drinking sloe gin fizzes , and practice couples dancing until we dropped away , one by one , reclaimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't ask her to come along .

I wanted to be as committed as Kimber , not just a schoolgirl mouthing lines . <p> " Sandy , I do n't know how you can pretend to be an actress when you do n't know anything about the greats . Quick , what 's Marlene Dietrich mean to you ? " <p> " My mother 's named after her . " I was losing interest in Todd anyway , ever since Kerry told me he that he 'd been writing crib notes on the undersides of his voluminous arms . Besides , I got to kiss him every night . " I 'll pack the sandwiches , " I said . <p> * <p> " But why Garbo ? " Kerry asked , when I asked him to cover for us at rehearsal . " I looked her up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a sweater and she 's got boney knees to boot . I like someone like a Jean Harlow or a Marilyn Monroe . Someone with a little umphh to them . I hate to say it , but this Garbo must 've really stunk in bed . " " You 're saying she was frigid , I guess . " <p> " Was n't she the one who was always ragging on how she just wanted to do it alone ? " <p> * <p> It 's 1937 , and Garbo , at thirty-two , has earned her most adult face , a gaunt heart pinned under picture hats and sausage curls , ragged white camellias . " I always look well when I 'm near death , " her character claims . But in real life , she only says she 's tired of playing " evil womens " who do nothing but make stupid love . <p> * <p> The marquee read : " Garbo Dies : Camille and Anna Karenina . " <p> I pulled the hood of my Red Riding Hood cloak up around my head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd done Anna Karenina in junior English , which Kerry called " Adultery Lit " making me think of my father and his goings-on . In that book , it was hard to decide which one you wanted to be : Dolly was old , Kitty was stupid , Anna was doomed . It was like looking at my mother and her friends . Maybe that was why I could never imagine myself as a woman , only an actress or a girl . <p> " Is n't it terrific ? " Kimber said . She pulled camera out of her huge black satchel . " Go ahead and shoot me , be sure to get the marquee . " <p> * <p> " It 's a beautiful color , " Marguerite Gautier exclaims over the fancy dress cover of Manon Lescaut . " It must be a good story . " Only after she 's made certain fatal imitations does she discover the girl was unscrupulous and faithless , a liar and a cheat . Of course , like Garbo , Camille has little time to read . " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her maid . Garbo herself said she did n't talk grammar in any language and could never finish a book . But she did send a maid out to buy up all the movie magazines the day they appeared on the stands . If a given issue did n't include an article on her own career , Garbo , a famous tightwad , was n't above returning it . And since she did n't grant interviews , it 's tempting to speculate what she was looking for : a new angle , perhaps , something that would place the moonscape of her personality at a new remove , and finally show her what to do . <p> * <p> The theater was the same tattered venue where I 'd seen Romeo and Juliet with my entire ninth grade class . The red velvet drapes were torn and the gilt paint on the various golden scrolls was peeling off in strips . A deep smell of insecticide permeated the aisles . And even though the theater was practically empty , Kimber wanted to sit in the balcony . At the entrance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its fuzz came off on my hand . Several chandeliers had been lowered to the floor in the boxes around us and covered with clear plastic drop cloths . They looked like wedding cakes covered in cobwebs , and I remembered that they 'd been there when Kerry and I went to see Rocky Horror Picture Show a few months back . It looked like they were n't going to be replaced any time soon . I gripped onto the railing to make sure it was sturdy : that much had lasted , at least . <p> Kimber set up camp there : Coke to one side , soft black coat wrapped around her shoulders like a shawl , satchel resting under her feet . She grasped both arm rests and twisted her head back luxuriously against the back of her seat , so that her felt hat fell off , and she did n't even pick it up . Her hair was washed , for once , and it fell in pressed brown-red crinkles to her shoulders <p> " Well , I 'm just as happy as an unborn child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misses me yet ? " <p> " Could be . It 's seven-fifteen . " <p> " Let me see that picture again . What ? The lighting 's off . My cheekbones are completely buried in fat . " <p> * <p> I 'm surprised by the black and white , even though Kimber has warned me this would happen , and claims I 'll forget about it by the end of the film . But the lack of color makes it hard to concentrate , since I 'm so used to the lame , quiana and colored strobes of my own night life . I notice Garbo 's hair is shaded in-between dark and light . I try to imagine its real color and realize , with a jolt , that it must be the same as mine , although I bet no one ever called her a dirty blonde . <p> * <p> About the time Marguerite and Armand escape into the country , we finish our sandwiches and Kimber starts passing me lozenges , which taste sweet and citrusy through the coating but then turn bitter as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toothpaste whenever we run out . I admit , I know they 're not candy . So I just swallow them quickly , stop at three or four . <p> * <p> " How good the earth smells . Better than any perfume . " <p> * <p> The sheep slump across the screen , loose inside their wool , the skirt of Margeurite 's dress billows , the bees swarm . I see the camellias move open and closed : life , death , it 's not so much to be afraid of . I can make the petals move any way I want . I practice peeling them back , bending them forward . The top of my head rises like the lopsided , homemade souffle my mother made to celebrate her freedom . I can feel Kimber breathing next to me . I can smell her slight ammoniac odor and hear the obstructions in her nasal passages . It makes me wonder whether acting can really be that hard . <p> * <p> My father , sitting in a nearby bar booting up a recalcitrant machine , sees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a bow , a pair of eyes . The Ms. Pacman program has interfaced with the poker game again . " Get over here , you chippie , " he says . " I 've got a bone to pick with you . " <p> * <p> " Damn it , Janet , " we scream . I 'm out of popcorn , and so I dip into Kerry 's box , and come up with a handful of seeds , remember the rice at an aunt 's wedding , and how she told us it was a cruel custom because when birds ate too much instant rice they exploded in air . But we all emptied out the blue net party favors anyway . Then I tasted one loose grain at the bottom , just to see . In the dark movie theatre , I drop the seeds onto the floor , which is so coated with debris that I think something may take root there and grow . <p> * <p> At school , Aaron Morris is playing my part . He takes off his shoes to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gym bag . He spits on his forefinger and rubs his hands together like a melodrama villain , then covers his face to feel the eyelashes flicker against the pads of his palms . He 's done this since he was five , whenever he wanted to get into character . It tickles , in the provocative way that sometimes , during sex , his hands become as sensitive as genitals , and he ca n't tell whether he 's touching or being touched . <p> * <p> But it 's not Juliet , with her neck-high cleavage , that gets the boys all hot and bothered . It 's Mercutio in tights , his little bag of marbles tied together with string and flapping dangerously close to the scabbord , close to the hero , who does n't seem to notice a thing . Queen Mab will be all over them tonight , her maple syrup welling out of their woods . " Fag ! " they yell . " Douche drain . " " Cunt . " It 's a riot . No one can stop them , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ridges of my cheekbones , like two perfect dots of rouge , I ca n't believe these are the people I 'm supposed to be crying over . <p> * <p> Armand throws the money onto her skirt . He 's won it gambling , of course , won it from another of the barons who keep cropping up in Garbo 's films . The poor hero 's convinced she 's dumped him for the cash . And now , just as Marguerite character is turning inside out like a glove for him , he finally gives in , adopts the worldly view , and admits , without pity , that she 's nothing but a whore . <p> * <p> Beside me , Kimber 's attention is waning . Her breath gets more clotted , until it 's almost a snore . I 'm afraid to look , to interrupt whatever going on with her . She 's been so excited about this , and now that we 've reached the climax , she 's finally gotten over her insomnia in a big way . <p> * <p> We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Paris . But this time Marguerite is gone , harvested by the disease which has been the only consistent love interest in her life . Even facing death , she looks fearlessly in the mirror , tucks a camellia in her sash for luck . <p> * <p> I touch her shoulder , her coat collar , her coarse hair . There 's a bit of foam on her lip , like the fine mustache off a Kahlua and cream . She mutters and lolls her head back in a way that frightens me . I do n't feel too good either . I reach into my purse for the gold hotel matchbook my father gave me : his beeper number is scribbled inside . <p> VI . Garbo Laughs <p> " Remember when a siren was ... a brunette and not an alarm ? " <p> Remember when your father walked into the lobby of the Bijou with his trench coat over his arm ? <p> * <p> At the hospital , he 's all over my mother , asking why she did n't tell him about Kimber ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we could be sued . His hair is blonder now , cut in leafy layers over his red ears and I wonder whether he 's been using Sun  --  In too . He tells her how she 's the irresponsible one , how he 's been saving for my college tuition all the time she 's been pissing my future away . She just sits tapping a rolled-up magazine against her crossed leg . Her mascara is smeared under one eye and her hair is as mismanaged as any souffle . <p> " Sandy , " she says . " Could you go get us some coffee , dear ? " <p> But I am far too sleepy to move . <p> * <p> " My face does n't compose well , " the Grand Duchess complains , before the Soviet envoy who will be Ninotchka takes over . " It 's all highlights . I 'm bored of this face . " But when Garbo arrives on the set , she makes a pass at Ina Claire , whose role has been whittled to a cameo to accommodate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retreats to the little boys ' room . Later , Claire will report that the Divine left the toilet seat up . <p> * <p> That night , after they pump Kimber 's stomach and announce that she 'll be OK , my father takes me home . He comes in , flips through the mail on the kitchen cabinet , unbuttoning his shirt with the other hand , and collapses on the sofa out on the sun porch . For a moment , I expect him to stumble over the back , then I remember where I am again . <p> " What about hitting the hay ? " he says . <p> But I hear him flipping channels , shaking the ice in his glass , opening drawers and bumping into furniture deep into my sleep , while I dive into dream after dream , hold my breath , and come up for air again . My shoulders are sore . My belly is distended , pumped up , like a football or a bicycle tire . <p> It 's an old movie , maybe Cary Grant , maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 'm the anesthesiologist . We wear black velvet masks with white strings to show our status . We have to operate on my sister 's face . My mother holds the girl 's head in her lap , while I assist . I see the sharp folds of flesh in the corners of her eyes , the gill-like quiver of her nostril . I press the sequined gas mask over her waxy lips . But the stuff is n't working , the girl stirs , my grip on her leg loosens , my mother 's knife slips . <p> * <p> Buljanoff , Iranoff , and Kopalski are your typical bunglers with a satirical twist : Muscovites who take too quickly to Paris . When seduced by capitalism in the form of Count Aigu , they lose interest in selling the Grand Duchess 's jewels for the needs of the Russian people and Comrade Garbo is sent in to finish the job . <p> * <p> In her hospital bed the next morning , Kimber sits up , asks for jalapeno jelly on rye toast , and makes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> stolen jewels <p> royalty <p> hotels <p> death <p> photographs <p> hats <p> Paris <p> staircases <p> champagne <p> She tugs at the hospital bracelet on her wrist , the only thing that 's changed since yesterday , and experiences a flicker of relief that she did n't choose that route . Her alimentary canal feels like snake skin , and tastes of brine and pickle juice . Her stomach lies coiled in a deep , muscular ache . She checks her cheekbones in her coffee spoon , then rings the bell again : she 's going to need another take . <p> * <p> Why did n't they think of it before ? In a tragedy , the beautiful woman with a foreign accent , no matter how sympathetic , must die . But comedy frees her up ; as a Bolshevist she can be extravagant in her asceticism , and extravagance is plainly Garbo 's only mode . Even her eccentricities : the thriftiness , the impatience with convention , the health food fetishes , are set into play . So it is only when she reaches her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laugh . <p> * <p> Before the final spate of movies , Greta packs her bags again . She 's off to Sweden , then Italy with Leopold Stowoski , the leonine conductor of the Philadelphia Orchestra . She brings : trousers , sandals , a simple swimsuit and enough jam to last for several weeks . Every morning at the Villa Cimbrone , she drags on her dressing gown and brings another jar down to breakfast . Afterwards the housekeeper washes them and lines them up on the casement , where Greta can see their clean edges cutting into the sun . Two , three , five days away from the business . She ca n't imagine any jewelry as beautiful as that . She and Stowaski lunch on beets and carrots ; he teaches her yoga up on the battlements ; they walk through the village examining the local produce . Every night , she retires with a box of salt and a bottle of olive oil . She does n't think about it as love , only the air on her skin , the vegetable fiber yielding under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his personality . She has n't felt this calm since Stiller . When the press catches up to the couple , they hold Garbo under siege in the Villa Cimbrone for three weeks , until she gives up and makes a deal : a press conference in exchange for complete isolation . <p> The question is the usual one : When does she plan to marry ? <p> Later , Greta goes to the kitchen , topless in her baggy shorts and big espadrilles , and packs up the empty jars , knowing they 'll never keep their part of the bargain . <p> * <p> He finds it in the kitchen pantry , alongside the oat flakes , the cans of tomato paste , the big tin of olive oil , the generic bags of flour , and the cute little jars of capers she must spill onto everything , now that she 's off and on her own , freed of meat , potatoes , calls to delay dinner every other night . It 's the capers that make him furious , even before he gets to the real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eggs , his spaghetti . Closer up , they looked like miniature sea urchins . And their slimy flavor of anchovy or tongue made it all too obvious that , despite his irregular lifestyle , it was his wife who had the exotic tastes . <p> * <p> But all she was looking for , she told the press hounds , was a man who could show her beautiful things . <p> * <p> Ninotchka wants the technical tour of Paris : the sewers , buses , and utilities . The Eiffel Tower is included only because of its reputation as an engineering feat . Count Aigu , unaccountably , knows nothing about it . He claims Parisians only go there for one reason-to jump off . <p> " How long does it take a man to land ? " <p> " Now is n't that too bad-last time I jumped , I forgot to time it . " <p> * <p> " You 've missed two rehearsals in a row , " Mr. Morris told me on the phone . " I 'm developing some personal mannerisms that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your can-can back to work or should I go ahead and give away your role ? " <p> " Kimber 's the only one who knows my lines . " <p> " Listen , I 'm sorry about that . Maybe we took on a little too much there . Who knew she was really that far gone ? I promise , I 'll take care of it , contact her parents , set something up for her . Now , tell me the truth , are you hungry enough to go through with this ? " <p> " My father found your bag , " I said , and hung up the phone . <p> * <p> They 're looking for a radio , some impersonal music to set off the champagne . But when the Count and Ninotchka stumble onto the hotel safe , they look into the empty box of the camera as if they 've never seen the jewels before , as if this is n't what they 've been haggling over the whole time . <p> " The czar sold ten thousand serfs in the market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tears of all Russia . " <p> And when Garbo says it , we believe it , we want some liquid misery of our own . <p> * <p> " Epic , " Kerry said . " So your old man is a player again . " <p> * <p> Kimber stands on the front porch with Sandy 's mother . They stare at the shadow of the four o'clocks against the wall , the woman and girl in profile , just a silhouette between them . <p> " We do n't have to go in if you do n't want to . There 's a matinee . " <p> Kimber nods her fierce head . <p> Inside , Sandy presses a warm , yeasty cheek to the windowpane and watches them walk back to the car . She remembers her mother 's story about sleeping with pennies in her cheeks , trying to make dimples . Now Sandy spends her teenage years cultivating cheekbones . It 's a wonder anyone ever makes it into film . <p> * <p> " Do n't ever ask me for a picture of myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in a drawer . I could n't breathe . I could n't stand it . " But that 's just what that pesky photographer Cecil Beaton does-hoards the famous profile his whole life , makes a reputation off it later . <p> * <p> " Sometimes pictures or photographs are more like people than people themselves . Very seldom when I am walking along with Garbo am I able to see her . " His favorite photo was taken in his own home , during one of the few periods when he managed to spirit her away from the possessive Schlee , whom he dubbed " the Russian sturgeon . " In this one , Garbo 's face is in the dark , her eyes barely visible . But the outline of her profile is lit with a thin , pencil-edged halo . Beaton , a technical genius , had used a simple heating element in a wall in his digs to achieve the effect . <p> * <p> So it 's a belly whopper , when it finally happens . At a stoplight , they run into a blond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a musical horn that repeats the first bar of " The Entertainer " over and over . When they ignore him , he cuts them off at the intersection and gets out , empties a bag full of women 's clothes and plastic implements onto the hood . Kimber feels the laughter tumble out of her sore throat , against her will , like coins from a slot machine . <p> VII . Two-Faced Women <p> The night of dress rehearsal , and Kerry and I are twisted together on the sofa trying to figure out how to lose our virginity . At least , I think that 's what we 're doing because we 're both completely recumbent , our bodies touching all along their length , and this is the closest I can imagine to going all the way . He grabs onto my breasts like he 's trying to pull himself up by them . As he snakes across my torso , I brush my hands over his naked back , feel the pimples on the skin , the hard nuggets of his vertebrae . I smell my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mixed up with his ginger and cologne . On the floor beside us sits my present : a pair of burnt orange suede pumps , which , according to Kerry , will give me perfect poise and presentation , allowing me to walk all over the competition . <p> * <p> " So you 're stepping out in both directions ? " Garbo said , when Beaton told her of his various affairs . <p> * <p> In 1941 , Hollywood had lost its European audience , due to the war , and MGM cast about for a way to give Garbo American appeal . They cut her hair , spruced up her wardrobe for a more cheerful outlook , and revived a domestic farce . In Two-Faced Woman , a long suffering wife sets a trap for her straying husband . Using a ploy favored in Hollywood , she disguises herself as her own twin sister , and attempts to seduce him in disguise . <p> * <p> There was a scraping of sliding doors , and Kimber 's harsh voice slid like a putty knife between us : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funny stuff saps all your energy for performance ? " <p> Kerry propped himself up on his arms and stared . <p> Beneath him , I could see the line where his orange-toned suntan met the fresh pink flesh of his neck . <p> " I did n't know you were so hot to cooperate , Ms. Mata Hari Movie Star . " <p> I pushed Kerry to the side , and sat up to look at Kimber . She was wearing my velvet pants and one of my mother 's scarves wrapped in a makeshift halter over her chest . Her skin was as rich and irregular as pulled taffy ; there was a snail 's trough over the appendix , a mole in her cleavage , a round white vaccination scar on the upper swell of shoulder . That was as much as I knew of her history , after six weeks of sleeping in the next bed . <p> " Not to worry . Gim me a ginger ale and a whiskey , " I said . " And do n't be stingy , baby . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Roman Catholic League of Decency . The organization objected to the assumed adultery , even though it was only an optical illusion . So MGM revised the script to show that the husband 's onto Garbo 's trick all along . This , apparently , was more satisfactory . No one mentioned the immorality of the circumstances that led to her deception in the first place . <p> * <p> Ever since that day when Kimber came home from the hospital and my mother took her to see Manhattan , they 've been acting peculiar . They quote bits standing by the open refrigerator , making sandwiches and lemonade . " I finally had an orgasm , but I found out it was the wrong kind . " <p> Kimber now only eats between meals , even though my mother takes special care to buy her favorite foods . She goes to school sporadically , but always manages to show up for rehearsal wearing some odd ensemble , her sallow skin marked with purple and mauve , her hair frizzed out to its limit . And , by some strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wear our clothing without asking . Robes and sweaters accumulate over the backs of chairs . Shoes collect like fallen fruit on the floor . No one sweeps , and I start seeing tiny tumbleweeds of her long , red hair rolling around the hallway . <p> I hang around my mother 's bedroom hoping for an explanation . <p> " It 's not like you could n't have called me , " she says . " I was sitting here organizing my files the whole time . I do n't know why you want to drag in the Gestapo . You remember how much trouble we had with him . " <p> " But how could you do it with Mr. Morris ? " <p> " It never bothered you before , " she said . " Or are you going to pretend you never noticed ? You 're no Sarah Bernhardt , you know . " <p> * <p> My last movie , like my first , is unwatchable . I disappear at both ends of the film career . Without the bad womens I hated so much , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want after all . I am tired of trying to express myself . I pull the brim of my hat down when I catch eye of a camera . I step behind the gentleman friends . I have made enough faces . <p> * <p> The effect , one critic quipped , was like watching Sarah Bernhardt get slapped with a pig 's bladder . <p> * <p> Neither of us slept the night before , but we did n't talk either . I lay in the dark and listened to her rough breath , like the sea in Anna Christie under a layer of tarp and burlap . I touched myself between the legs , as if I could unbutton myself from there , finding the thing that set me apart . But even though I shed my skin until I was raw , I never found the secret passageway into my own personality . <p> Some roles considered for Garbo after Two-Faced Woman failed : <p> Marie Curie <p> George Sand <p> Sarah Bernhardt <p> Desdemona <p> Hamlet <p> Dorian Gray <p> * <p> In the bathroom of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face one more time . A square open space with too many flats , not enough flow . Skin like onionskin paper , a single freckle blotting the freshly driven snow . Nose . Eyes . Broad bare expanse . Nose . Mouth . Nose . It 's the bones that count , they say , and these were clearly inherited from my mother : I guess that 's why Aaron likes them so much , he 's jumped hers often enough by now . I smear foundation over my forehead . I swear I 'll never do this for them again . My skin bristles under the tangerine polyester pantsuit suggested in the script . I ca n't smooth my nipples down , no matter how many times I brush the front , and my neck is flushed with whisker burn and some kind of rash from the makeup . I know my father is sure to be there tonight ; it 's my fault , he 'd never remember otherwise . But now , he 'll only be sitting around waiting to make his own show . <p> * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around Manhattan , a hermit about town . Garbo sightings were reported like comet tails ; she was spotted window  --  shopping in Times Square , fingering beets and carrots in the farmer 's market , pricing baubles in an antique store . The screenwriter Mercedes de Acosta , a lifelong friend and one-time lover , worried about the deterioration of Garbo 's mental state . Most especially , she worried about the pernicious influence of George Schlee , with his awful mixture of Slav , Brooklynese , and baby talk . <p> Garbo , for her part , distrusted the flamboyant Mercedes more and more as she aged . When questioned , she claimed the old queen brought her bad luck . At one point , Mercedes sent Greta to a chiropractor who " made her bones float about in her body " and distorted one side of her mouth . <p> * <p> Watching from the wings , Kerry remembers his tongue in her mouth , the slug-like pressure of her lips . Sandy is n't the prettiest girl he 's known ; her breasts are too small , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after a few drinks . But he likes the wise way she pronounces dirty phrases . He likes the flutter inside her rib cage when he pumps her tit . On stage , Todd reaches for her elbow , Kerry gets a slide tromboner to the pelvis , and he likes that , too . <p> * <p> Marlene sits in the back of the house , avoiding recognition and laughing at the idea that she 's become a stage mother . At thirty-six , she does n't need the fuss of love . Her life has been a process of subtraction . First , the eye liner , then the girdle , then the bra , followed by the bows and frills she had favored as a young girl . After that , of course , the husband dropped off as a natural result . Now she 's down to foundation and mascara , a pair of cotton underpants , a closet full of simple shirt dresses , and a secret lover with womanly hands . <p> But then there 's the problem of daughters : as she pares down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a concentrated effort to stop at one , but she 's somehow ended up with two of them , one from the real marriage , one from the show . They 've got three personalities each , six faces , revolving wardrobes , suicidal urges and colliding sex drives . The whole thing makes her dizzy : no one should have to live through this twice . And when Sandy makes a suggestive move up there , Marlene squints into the light and sees her stretching out over the stage , a long line of paper dolls holding hands into perpetuity . What will she ever be able to tell them about how to keep their shadows under control ? <p> * <p> He 'll bring a morals charge , that 's what he 'll do . The thought sends a current through his chest , his pectorals lighting up like winning numbers . He 's sitting next to a gaggle of dyke-spinsters-Marly 's buddies , who remember his wilder days and keep whispering among themselves , then ogling him through their cat-eye spectacles . Hey , hey , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed to be watching up there . But he can hardly look either , when that thug puts his hand on the nutshell curve of the girl 's lower back . All he can think of is Marly , Marly , you used to be that innocent for me . <p> * <p> Just when everything was going so well , Aaron sees Kimber crawling onto stage , and remembers when he first saw her cringing on her front porch . The old tragic flaw . Catching up to him again . For the moment , the audience is distracted by the stage kiss , but that ca n't last for long , not with the priggish kids he 's got doing his romancing up there . He signals to Kerry to go get her , but the boy seems hypnotized , staring at the mellow circle of light on the stage . <p> * <p> I fall over the sofa , as expected , but when Todd gets up , it 's really Kimber who reappears . We look at each other , sweating under the lights , the makeup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She is Garbo , I think , her cheekbones gleaming like a pair of polished antlers on a trophy wall . I am Garbo , my big feet and shoulders shaking the scenery , my eyes dealing deuces , my X-ray skin recording the play of lust and sorrow in the crowd . What can I do but deliver the stage kiss , the way I 've been taught ? Her lips are cool . My tongue is raw . Her loose breasts nestle under my clavicle ; her sour smell sifts up through my nose . And although Mr. Morris will never cast either of us again , I still take one last cue from him : I only hope we land without breaking any bones . <p> * <p> I am not a normal man . I have a bad stomach , I do n't go out in company , I ca n't drive , I never sleep at night . My only gift is to make films but I hate to be looked at . My only use is to make love , but I ca n't stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naked faces , do you know ? Women are sure some sad animals with their naked faces and their stupid love affairs . Never ask me about the movies . The bones are made to float about in my body , and I am not a normal man . <p>
