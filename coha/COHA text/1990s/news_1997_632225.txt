<p> It seemed an unlikely place for him to be , this plain brick bungalow in Cicero . <p> But once again he had come , a balding , bespectacled man wearily climbing the stairs , gathering himself for a brief moment , pressing the buzzer on the door . <p> If the neighbors had spotted him , known who he was , they surely would have been astonished , rushed over for a word , an autograph , a blessing . They surely would have begged his time , his attention . <p> But , as usual , no one noticed . <p> Here , he was just a man . <p> And so the door opened , and Joseph Cardinal Bernardin slipped inside , received the way he wanted to be : quietly , warmly , anonymously . As a friend . As a brother . <p> Unbeknownst to all but his close friends , staff and family , Bernardin sought escape here dozens of times over a 10-year period , until his death one year ago . <p> In a relentless schedule of church meetings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could carve turkey or stir soup or simply talk . <p> Here he developed an extraordinary private relationship with a small family that opened its home to him  --  " three little women "  --  Felicitas Santos , her sister , Estrella , and their mother , Mama Irene . <p> Bernardin 's works were well-known to Chicago and to much of the world . His story of courage and peace in the face of death gave inspiration to a city and a people . <p> Far less known was the humble home in Cicero that gave rest to one of the country 's highest of holy men . <p> They had come from the Philippines in the early 1970s and lived in a two-flat apartment building when they first met Bernardin . <p> Felicitas , known as " Tita , " and Estrella , known as " Star , " volunteered weekends at the Little Sisters of the Poor nursing home in Chicago , where Bernardin 's mother was a resident . <p> There , and at church , they struck up an acquaintance . <p> " Someday , Archbishop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telling her sister . <p> " You must be dreaming , " she answered . " We are not rich . Only the rich become friends of dignitaries . " <p> " Believe me , " Tita responded . " He will visit again and again . " <p> But he could not , he said when they asked . As much as he would have liked to , there simply was not time . Someday , he told them , someday . <p> On a warm autumn afternoon , four years later , after a mass for the 75th anniversary of Mary , Queen of Heaven parish , he finally agreed . <p> One visit . For a few minutes . <p> He arrived with another priest , the Rev. Leroy Wickowski , who had helped celebrate the mass . <p> " We were humbled , " said Star Santos . " We who are poor and nobody . And here was this great man , this man of God who came to our home . We thought : What did he find in us , why did he come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but of the Santoses ' lives in the Philippines , of their current jobs , how they were doing in the United States . He met their mother . <p> " He was very warm , " she said . " Very down to earth . He put us right at ease . " <p> They were n't the only ones who got something out of the visit . Away from the pressures of the job , he seemed to relax . <p> " I will come here again soon , " he told them . " You have a lovely family . " <p> He did . A weekend here , a holiday there . <p> In 1987 , the family moved into a small brick home on South Austin Boulevard , and Bernardin continued his visits , accompanied by other church leaders , including Monsignor Ken Velo , his top personal aide . <p> " It was a ritual , " Velo said . " He was touched by the fact that they wanted to make him a brother , and he responded in kind . " <p> Those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this home he could take a day off , be himself . <p> The Rev. L. Scott Donahue , who accompanied Bernardin on several visits , would later write of the remarkable effect the visits had on the archbishop . <p> " Joseph Cardinal Bernardin was a giant of a man of God , " Donahue wrote . " Giants , like the rest of us , need an oasis , a place to renew the spirit , to be nourished , to be playful and to be cared for . ( He ) found one such oasis in a small bungalow on a busy street in Cicero , Ill . <p> " In the home of Star , Tita and Mama Irene Santos , Cardinal Bernardin found rest . " <p> He visited nearly every Christmas and Easter , and at least once a month , for 10 years . <p> The sisters , who first called him " his eminence , " shortened it to " his em . " He called them the " three little women . " <p> They marveled at how at home he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it was warm enough , " Tita Santos recalls . " He would help take the rolls out of the oven . He would make his own coffee  --  as if I 'm the guest . " <p> Sometimes in his black cassock , many times in a flannel shirt and casual slacks , he would arrive by himself , collapse into a chair and prop his feet up . <p> " He did n't talk about his work , " Tita Santos says . " That 's why he loved to come here . " <p> Most visits would be followed with a personal note . <p> " Dear Tita , Star and Mama Irene , " read one , dated Nov. 29 , 1992 . " What a wonderful way to celebrate Thanksgiving ! Many thanks for everything  --  the delicious dinner , the beautiful gifts and , most of all , your delightful company ! I look forward to seeing you on Christmas morning . Love , your brother , Joseph .

" But I will keep praying for you , that you will come back home soon , for good . " <p> It was n't long after that Bernardin was diagnosed with cancer , but the visits continued , up until two months before his death . <p> " I 'd like to see you before you leave , " Star recalls him telling her over the phone when she was in town for a visit . " Can I come over tomorrow for lunch ? " <p> He drove over alone on Aug. 3 , 1996 , his last visit . As always , the sisters took photos to commemorate the stay . <p> " Tita and I cried when he left , " Star recalls . " We wanted someone to drive him . He seemed to be having so much trouble , but he drove . We were worried he might fall down the steps . He left , alone . " <p> They stayed in touch by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A month later , Tita and her mother faced their first Christmas without a visit from Bernardin in more than a decade . <p> " It was just me and mom because Star was in Alaska , " she says . " I said that since his eminence came around every Christmas , I will cook like I always have . I prepared the table , set a place where he always sat . Then I went to the window and waited for him to come . He did not come , of course . This time , he did n't come . " <p> On a raw November afternoon , down a leaf-strewn lane off Austin Boulevard in Cicero , Tita opens the door to the small brick home she still shares with her elderly mother . <p> " Come in , come in , " she says . " I want to show you something . " Like her mother and her sister , she is a tiny woman , with a swirl of dark hair and a gracious smile . She welcomes a visitor into the living room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their home  --  to protect the cardinal from the media that likely would have seized on the story  --  she is eager to finally talk about the man they came to know as a brother . <p> " Look , " she says . <p> Pictures line a fireplace mantel , a bureau , a television . In them , Bernardin , relaxed and content , beams in the house . In one , he wears a flannel shirt ; in another , his feet are propped up on a foot rest ; in another , during his last visit , he sits back in a casual blue shirt , looking weary . <p> Gifts given by him to the family , from Rome , from Germany , crowd a coffee table : small carved wooden angels , a crystal sculpture , a portrait burned in wood above a bureau . <p> It is almost like a shrine . But in this home , it feels more like a tribute to a beloved family member . <p> The sisters have collected many of these photos , these family moments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slim , modest volume that is more a family album than a work of literature . Which is fine with them . <p> " We miss him so much , " Tita says , glancing around the living room , Bernardin 's home away from home . <p> " It 's OK . He was a giant man who came to our humble house . He will always be here .
