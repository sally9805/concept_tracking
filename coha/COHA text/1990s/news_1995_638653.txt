<p> MORRISON - If you have n't met Sean Davis and/or wo n't in the future , do n't worry about it . It is n't necessary . <p> You already know him . Or , as the case applies , you will . Soon . <p> Davis , you see , is a teenager whom every high-schooler who ever was - or ever will be - runs into at some point in their prep years . <p> The Bear Creek senior is not only one of those kids who gets great grades , is a star in sports and has little problem socially , but he also has met trouble and lived to tell about it - repeatedly . <p> He is a sort of everyman to the teenaged-generation 's order , one who excels in many tasks as a young man , yet one who survives others in a devilish manner underlined by the innocence of youth and a no-fear mindset . <p> He has a knack for creating happenings . He 's involved . People talk about him . <p> Being cool is n't a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't say much . He does n't have to . <p> Quick , baby boomers , sound like anyone you knew back in your midteens ? <p> " He 's the most unassuming kid you ever saw in your life , " Bear Creek coach Tom Thenell said . <p> Perhaps . But as the eve of the 1995 football season draws near , the ante has been raised considerably . <p> Davis , definitely one of Colorado 's most interesting schoolboy personalities in memory , surely will be one of the state 's hottest names for Division I recruits . <p> After all , if he has his average season Davis will have thrown for more career yards than just about any high-school kid who ever played . <p> It 's his chance , as he points out , " to go somewhere and play . <p> " I 'm ready , " he shrugged . <p> I 'll bet . <p> Davis ' totals already rank among the best in Colorado history . <p> Unfortunately , they often are trivialized in state circles when his name comes up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including within his own league ( Jefferson County ) , considering him " not that good , " or saying " I 'd rather have my kid , " and b ) the myth that teams throwing the ball in fickle Colorado weather do n't do anything in the playoffs . <p> That 's ridiculous , of course , because : c ) Davis easily should have started for all but about two Colorado teams over the last two years , and d ) Bear Creek , which finally had the linemen to compete up front in ' 94 , made it the state semifinals . <p> These are the facts : <p> His 7,557 yards passing in three years as the Bears starting quarterback already puts him third in state annals behind Ryan Clement ( Mullen ) , 9,273 . <p> He is second in Colorado in career attempts ( 833 , 24 behind Clement ) and needs just 21 completions to pass Clement ( 551 ) for first in that category , too . <p> The next touchdown strike for the three-time Post all-state selection , which would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state history . <p> Last season , his 183 completions in 257 attempts ( 71.2 percent ) was the second-best showing in a single Colorado season . <p> Davis also has rushed for 20 TDs , which means he either has run or thrown for some 83 scores in just 32 games . <p> Nationally , the numbers game gets even better . According to updated figures , he already ranks 24th all time in yards passing . Two ahead of him is a guy named Pat Haden , who had 7,633 . <p> If he never completes another pass as a schoolboy , Davis has surpassed the yardage total of the likes of Ron Powlus , Peyton Manning , Heath Shuler and Cale Gundy . <p> The all-time national leader in career passing yards is Josh Booty , who took apart Louisiana schoolboy play to the tune of 11,700 yards . That may or may not be out of reach for Davis . But no other high-schooler ever has gone past 10,000 yards , so Davis has other chances to out-throw Todd Marinovich , brothers Koy and Ty Detmer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become just the eighth player to have 1,000 attempts , to crack the top 10 in career TD tosses and become the all-time leader in completions ( he needs 162 ) . <p> Know which mark he had his eye on recently ? <p> " I 'd like to break coach Thenell 's record , " he said . <p> Figures . <p> Thenell , a Mullen star in 1978-79 , completed 68.5 percent of his passes , the career-best on record in the state . <p> Said the coach : " I wo n't be surprised at anything he does . " <p> Nor will Overland coach Tony Manfredi : " We definitely respect him . " <p> " An excellent high-school quarterback , " added Arvada West coach and former National Football League wide receiver Dave Logan . <p> Davis also has some great history in other areas . <p> Such as : <p> Born in Durango , he spent his first days in a teepee . That 's because he describes his parents as being former " hippies . " <p> Gary , his dad , chuckles at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was n't a teepee like on the Great Plains and in the mountains of the old west , but rather a pretty elaborate one , and for another , he has been in the car business for more than two decades , which has taken him and the rest of the Davis clan ( mom Yolanda and brothers Jason , Joel and Michael ) to various parts of the western states . <p> Two weeks before the start of his junior year , Davis got into an automobile accident . The Jeep rolled and he bruised the left side of every rib . " I flew out , " Davis said , " and this thing just kept flipping toward me . " Added Thenell : " Yeah , but he did n't miss a play . " <p> Of course , no stranger to fisticuffs but never really a fan of going out and looking for it , Davis once got into a scuffle with " somebody 's dad who was picking on somebody . " The man , Davis said , " came out after me in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be knocked out on the ski slopes and jump off cliffs into water . <p> He refuses to watch a lot of television because he 'd " rather be doing something . " He reads a lot and also is a 15-handicapper in golf . Besides , he does n't have a 3.7 grade-point average by staring at the tube . And he has handled the likes of Russian in the class room . Said Thenell : " Who takes Russian ? " <p> Davis prefers the punk-rock sounds of Guttermouth to most others and can be seen slamming at the Ogden Theater whenever somebody worth seeing is in town . <p> Since Thenell threw him in the secondary last season , Davis , who usually has the dirtiest uniform of any player on the field , also enjoys his chance at handing out some of those licks , particularly after a stalled Bears drive or a turnover . " It 's not like on offense , " he said . " You can work out some of your frustrations . " <p> He also was an accomplished wrestler as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first two high-school years , finishing third at 152 pounds as a sophomore . <p> If you get the feeling that this is a resilient kid , then you 're not alone . <p> " Tough ? " asked Manfedi . " He 's taken a few beatings , but you never hear a peep out of him . " <p> Said Thenell : " He 's physically tough and that 's made him emotionally and mentally tough , too . " <p> " He 's a linebacker with the mentality of a quarterback , " said Gary Davis . <p> He should know . Years ago , his third-oldest son was wiping out linemen in drills in little-kids ' play . <p> And when Thenell asked permission to throw his son to the big boys of Colorado prep football as a ninth-grade starting quarterback , both the father and the coach got the same response . <p> A big grin followed by a hearty : " Well , sure I can handle it . " <p> Duh ! Apparently a stupid question . <p> Now a bulked-up 6-feet , 197 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to not rest on his laurels , " Thenell said . " Year by year he 's gotten better . He lifts weights and throws the ball . " <p> Davis , who also has clocked a 4.6-second effort in the 40-yard dash , can bench press 300 pounds , squat with 380 and clean and jerk 285 . <p> There have been some inquiries about the quality of his arm strength , although Thenell swears that is n't a problem , and Davis , well , is n't worried . <p> When asked how far he can throw a football Davis replied : " I do n't know . " <p> Thenell has an idea , though : " When I watch films and his back foot touches our 40 and he throws it into the end zone , I know he can throw it . " <p> " My job , " Davis simply states , " is to get the ball to the right guys in the right places . " <p> Plus , Thenell boasts , Davis is " a winner . " Three years ago as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming off two successive playoff performances , afloat at 4-6 , then a year later he helped them qualify for the playoffs . And they were a game away from playing for a championship last year . <p> " He 's got that something about him , " Thenell said , " that when he 's on your side , you do n't worry about it . He 's just not worried about it no matter if it 's bad or good . <p> " And we got him . " <p> College-wise , Davis , who said he " definitely will wait until the end of the year " to decide on a college , thinks perhaps forestry will be his major . <p> But that could change , depending on what happens with football . His dad , though , thinks that if somebody comes in during the season with something substantial , he might commit then . <p> According to those on his " short " list , the likes of Colorado , SMU , BYU , Texas , Notre Dame , Nebraska , Oregon and Wyoming are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WAC to Notre Dame , " Thenell said . " I think he wants to go somewhere where he knows that they need him , somewhere where they want to win . " <p> " He 's never not played on any team he 's ever been on , " said Gary Davis . <p> Said Sean : " The thing is , I 'm only 6-foot , 197 pounds , not real big <p> " It does n't matter if it 's close to home or not . I just want to go somewhere when I can play more than one year . "
