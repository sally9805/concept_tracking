I 'VE SAID IT BEFORE , AND I 'M SAYING IT AGAIN : THE ONLY thing we ever learn about the gun business is that we never learn . Just four years ago the industry was said to be going the way of the dodo . Gunmakers were wailing like Irishmen at a wake , and once-mighty names such as Winchester were rumored to be tottering toward their final resting place . But have you been in a gun shop lately ? I stopped by the local establishment last week with half a mind to buy a shotgun I 'd had my eye on . It was a pretty little over/under with excellent breeding but with the kind of price tag that makes you wonder if the dealer is suffering from delusions of grandeur . I 'd hoped a bit of horse trading would make it more affordable , but if not , I 'd fall back on a reliable hard luck story from my deprived childhood . ( Dad had to sell his Parker shotgun during the Depression , leaving me without an inheritance . ) It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's gone , " the dealer told me . " I 'll put you on the waiting list for another , but you 'll be about seventh in line . " And that 's how it is across the country . Gunmakers are working extra shifts to keep up with demand , some types of ammo are virtually rationed , and U.S. Repeating Arms , said to be moribund awhile back , is putting the finishing touches on a modern , multimillion dollar plant built on the site of the old Winchester factory . ( Is it true that Winchester is reintroducing the pre-1964 style Model 70 ? We 'll see next month when we introduce the new rifles for 1994 . ) BERETTA Beretta , the oldest name in gunsmithing ( and one of the world 's oldest firms of any sort ) , takes a big bite of the American handgun market with its American-made autoloaders , but many shotgunners have found its Italian-made over/unders a bit pricey . Although the smooth-handling , quickpointing Beretta smoothbores are a staple in sporting clays , many shotgunners have never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which frustrates promoters who have yearned for the Beretta trademark to project a swanky Italian cachet like Ferrari or Ferragamo . This year Beretta abandons such pretenses by introducing an over/under that , at a suggested price of $1,215 , challenges other working men 's over/unders on a head-to-head , down-and-dirty dollar basis . This does n't mean that the new shotgun is a substandard Beretta , because it is n't . Beretta begins with its high-quality barrels and action , puts them together with the came care given its other firearms , but leaves out such superfluous stuff as action decoration , side ribs and bright metal finish . All of which makes the gun a no-nonsense " essential " shotgun . In fact , that 's what this new Beretta is called , the Model 686 Essential . What the gunmaker did not leave out are features we 've come to expect in any racy Beretta over/under : selective ejectors , single selective trigger , chromed bores , vent rib , screw-in chokes and good wood . It comes in 12-gauge only , with three-inch chambers and a choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at about 6-1/2 pounds . BROWNING Browning and " automatic " just naturally go together . Like Mom and apple pie , it 's hard to speak of one without the other . So , when Browning unveils a new self-loading shotgun , shooters stand up and take notice . In recent times , though , Browning has introduced so many short-lived autoloaders that a guidebook is needed to sort out the different models and variations . Do n't get me wrong , all have been fine guns , well-finished and incorporating the latest technology . But Browning 's retention of the " square back " profile never stirred nostalgic longings the way Browning stylists had hoped . After all , the venerable A-5 is still available for those who crave that unmistakable look . With its new Gold shotgun , Browning offers an autoloader that is truly new and a sensational departure from traditional Browning styling . The Browning fit and finish of wood and metal are still obvious in this gun , but the look and feel is sleek , low profile and exceptionally pointable . If it were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to catch on the straightaway . There is no Browning nostalgia here ; the gently contoured receiver is the best looking since the old Model 50 Winchester . But more importantly , the receiver was designed not just as a housing for the mechanism but also as an actual aid to the gun 's pointability . This becomes evident when you shoulder the gun and note how close your grip hand is to the line of sight and how the conformation of the stock 's grip puts more control in your rearward hand . I could go on about this , but when you pick up the Gold you 'll instantly understand . The mechanism is gas operated , of course , soft kicking , self-cleaning and shoots all loads without adjustments . Take down for cleaning and carry is fast and simple , and loading is from the bottom . At present the new Gold comes in 12 or 20-gauge , with the 20 being a trimmer , scaled-down version . The makes one yearn for an even further scaled-down 28-gauge and  --  why not ?  --  even a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as are three-inch chambers , vent rib , good walnut with rubber pads and Invector Plus or Invector screw-in chokes . Barrel lengths are 26 inches , 28 inches and 30 inches for the 12-gauge , with average weight being about 7 pounds 6 ounces . The 20-gauge weighs about 6 pounds 14 ounces , with a choice of 26-inch or 28-inch barrels . As always , the 1994 browning catalog is a classy showpiece in itself , and while turning its pages I attempted to count all of the grades , gauges and variations of the popular Citori over/under . Finally I gave up  --  there are too many . A new one that caught my eye is the new top-of-the-line Golden Clays . This new grade , which is distinguished by gold bird and clay target inlays , extensive engraving and highly figured wood , is available in all target models . A.H . FOX Fox ? Did n't this manufacturer stop making guns back during the Great Depression ? Well , yes , but good guns have a way of coming back to life , and aficionados @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ H. Fox to be among the best , and certainly the best looking , of all American-made doubles . The Fox was the product of a lavish era of gunsmithing that lasted about four decades , ending with the Depression 's lean years . Like other shotguns of its time , the Fox came in several grades , with collectors now paying serious money for the rare and elegant top models . The problem is that there just are n't enough of the old Foxes to go around . Now the A.H . Fox is being re-created in five high-grade versions ranging from the " CE " up to Exhibition Class . Unlike the Parker Reproduction , which was successfully introduced a few years back , the new Fox is made entirely in the United States by a firm called the Connecticut Shotgun Manufacturing company . The management has quite a sense of style . Even its brochure harks back to a golden era , but more to the point , how good are the guns ? In a word : magnificent . The few samples I 've seen and briefly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and checkered than the originals . Anyone who says that great craftsmanship is dead in America had better take a look at these guns . A ringing question that came to mind when I inspected the new Fox is why , with such skill and resources available , does this gunmaker bother making a reproduction of anything Good looking as the original Fox was , it was n't without its mechanical shortcomings . Would n't it be great to see an entirely new Great American Double ? These people could do it . By the way , if you 're hoping the new Fox is less pricey than the original , forget it . Prices begin at more than five grand and go up to $25,000 . MARLIN It 's a tossup whether Marlin 's new Model 512 shotgun should be in this article or next month 's introduction of this year 's new rifles . It sure looks like a rifle , and in our tests it certainly shot like a rifle . The M-512 is a redo of Marlin 's M-55 clip-fed bolt-action Goose Gun . The M-512 has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , drilled and tapped for a scope base ( which is included ) and a bolt handle altered for scope use . Even the press-checkered stock is configured along rifle lines . Obviously the purpose of the Marlin 512 is to shoot rifled slugs , and this it does with riflelike accuracy . During a quick test of the M-512 this past deer season , we found it would honestly group three shots inside a two-inch circle at 100 yards using Remington 's new Copper Solid slugs . Because poor accuracy is the principal limitation of many shotgun/slug combinations , the new Marlin is a wish come true for big-game hunters who have longed for a moderately priced shotgun that delivers dependable accuracy with today 's popular sabot-encased shotgun slugs . It comes in 12-gauge , with three-inch chambers ( I recommend 2-3/4-inch loads for best accuracy ) , weighs eight pounds and holds three rounds . RUGER When the Ruger over/under shotgun was unveiled in 1977 , it was considered " typically Ruger " in that it was radically untypical . Now , 17 years later , the slim , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ model variations and has proven to be highly adaptable to change , always a hallmark of good gun design . The latest variations include a long-barreled ( 30-inch ) 20-gauge for sporting clays and  --  are you ready for this ?  --  the long anticipated 28-gauge . The trim sub-bore , at six pounds for the 26-inch-barrel model , is a full pound lighter than the 20-gauge Ruger and , like all currently produced Ruger shotguns , features a stainless-steel receiver along with such standard niceties as single selective trigger , automatic ejectors , vent rib and choke tubes . The 28-gauge is also available with 28-inch barrels . Thirty-inch barrels may seem a bit strange on a 20-gauge gun , but longer barrels are very much in vogue on both sporting clays and skeet courses . The longer sighting plane means more precise alignment and helps pick up the target quicker . Of course , the weight-forward balance also has a smoothing effect on swing and follow-through . To keep the additional barrel length of Ruger 's new 20-gauge Sporting Clays from making it too muzzle heavy , the side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any event , and keeps weight to 7-1/2 pounds . Sporting clays or not , this should be one hell of a fine dove gun . All Ruger 12s and 20s now have back-bored barrels and longer choke tubes , which , by the way , are not interchangeable with the old-style tubes . REMINGTON The guy in charge of developing new guns at Remington is a smart young fellow by the name of Jay Bunting . It 's a name worth remembering because he 's going to powerfully influence the look of shotguns and rifles well into the next century . Before you tag him as a desk-bound technocrat , let me tell you that he won last year 's U.S. Open amateur skeet championship . More importantly , he is n't afraid of new ideas , knows a good thing when he sees it and has the clout to push it into production . This explains why you 'll find 19 new guns or modifications in this year 's Remington catalog , 11 of which are shotguns , plus some extras that you 'll soon be wanting . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the Model 11-87 Shooters Special , a gun that is available only through those dealers who snatched them up during a limited ordering period . The gun is an instant collector 's item , and you wo n't find it in the Remington catalog . The Shooters Special starts as a Model 11-87 Premier Light Contour autoloader , but a curly maple stock and forend make the gun attractive and unique . The gun comes with a 28-inch vent rib , high polished blue metal , and it is packaged in a hard airline-safe case filled with goodies such as shooting glasses , knife and cleaning kit . There is n't room here to describe all of the other new Remingtons , but the big improvement is a better cantilevered scope mounting system than the earlier one . But first , why a cantilevered scope base ? Or why a scope base at all ? The scoped shotgun is an idea whose time has come , and it 's big business . Not just for big-game hunting , but even savvy turkey hunters are getting wise to its advantages . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scope attached so that it stayed in place and held zero . With a scope mounted on a shotgun 's receiver , as is common with rifles , the loose-fitting barrels typical of many pumps and autos tend to shift position from shot to shot . This causes a " wandering " zero . By attaching the scope directly to the barrel they both point in the same direction , even if the barrel is n't tight in the receiver . This explains Remington 's cantilevered scope-base system , which is anchored rigidly to the barrel and extends back over the receiver , without touching it , so that the scope is in proper position for aiming . New Remingtons that can be had with the improved cantilevered base include Model 1100 and 11-87 autoloaders , as well as the 870 pump . Each is available in standard models with wood stocks-and bright metal or the popular SP ( Special Purpose ) guns , which are distinguished by dull finished metal and dead black synthetic stocks . Either way , the new Remington shotguns that come with an integral scope base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is smart because the added comb height gets your eye up where you can see through the scope without having to stretch your neck like some sort of weird bird . Depending on which version you go for , you have a choice of rifled barrel for best accuracy with the new sabot-sleeved slugs ( such as Remington 's Copper Solid ) or standard smoothbore with screw-in Rem chokes . If you are buying a shotgun strictly for big game , I 'd go with the rifled barrel because of the accuracy advantage . The smoothbore , however , offers dual duty for turkeys and small game , and you 'll still have the option of using Remington 's rifled choke tube for deer hunting . Of special interest is Remington 's introduction of 20-gauge 1100s and 870s with rifled barrels . Both include the new scope base . I have n't tested any 20-gauge slugs , but people who have tell me that the accuracy can be astonishing . Anyone with much experience with 12-gauge slugs knows that the recoil can make your eyes water , so the lighter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as young hunters . Speaking of which , the short-stocked 20-gauge 870 Youth Gun is available with a 20-inch rifled barrel for young hunters . It comes fitted with rifle-style open sights . About now you may be tempted to throw something across the room and lament the fact that Remington 's current slug guns are such an improvement over the one you currently own . Happily , you wo n't have to buy a whole new gun because the gunmaker is offering extra barrels , rifled and smoothbore , with the new scope base for 100s , 11-87s and 870s . There are too many to list here , so pick up a Remington catalog  --  which , by the way , is my idea of a real catalog because it includes the prices . See the address in the " Catalogs And Information " sidebar . WINCHESTER It was n't exactly hate mail , but when I wrote an article about the coming era of synthetic stocks , we got a batch of letters denouncing me and my suggestion that materials other than wood were decent and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told you so , " but that was two decade ago , and you know what has happened since . Not only have synthetic stocks become acceptable in shooting society , but in many instances they are the preferred choice of hunters . Though originally considered mainly an advantage to rifle accuracy , it 's amazing how synthetic stocks have caught on for shotguns , such as Winchester 's three new specialty Model 1300s . By " specialty " I mean guns designed for one specific use , which , as you 've noticed , is a growing trend in the hunting business . Two of these pump guns , aptly named Black Shadows because of their black stocks and nonglare black metal ( even the bolt is black ) , are for turkey and deer hunting . The deer version has a 22-inch smoothbore barrel fitted with adjustable rifle sights and WinChoke screw-in tubes . It comes with an improved cylinder tube , which is fine for shooing slugs , and other choke tubes are available for buckshot hunters who want to tune their patterns . The Black Shadow Turkey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ventilated rib . The third new 1300 is identical to the Black Shadow Turkey except that the stocks have a Realtree camo pattern , and it comes with a matching padded sling . The Black Shadows come with fitted sling studs , and all three of the new guns are drilled and ready for fitting one of today 's hot new shotgun scopes . ( See " Peeping Toms , " OUTDOOR LIFE , February 1994 . ) Fitted with scopes and the right choke tube , any of these three would make a hard-to-beat deer or turkey gun . They are 12-gauge , with three-inch chambers and weigh about seven pounds . CATALOGS AND INFORMATION A.H . FOX SHOTGUNS Connecticut Shotgun Manufacturing Co .
