Mary Soon Lee lives in Pittsburgh and works for a small artificial intellignece company . She first introduced us to linguist anna Suzorsky and the Eridanians " Universal Grammar " ( April 1996 ) . Now we return to the sama mig for a lesson in trust and noivete . ( And surely you know by now that last word is n't in the dictionary . Really . Trust me . ) <p> HOLMAN PUT HIS HAND on my arm just before we entered the - U.N. security council meeting . " Janna , remember , be polite . " I shrugged my arm free . " What do you think I 'm going to do ? Yell at the council ? " The doors opened before Holman could answer , but he shot me a warning look before taking his seat at the oval table . Judging by the ministers " crumpled suits and the jungle of coffee mugs on the table , the security council had n't had much more sleep than Holman and I. This was the fifth time in forty-eight hours that they had summoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same questions : had we seen evidence of subterfuge or conspiracy in our dealings with the aliens , were there any traps disguised within the Confederate contract ? " Dr. Holman , Dr. Suzorsky , " said the Japanese minister , " Thank you for your cooperation . General Dumar asked to review your testimony one final time . " I could feel my forced smile mutating into a grimace . Most of the council members at least pretended to be considering the merits of the Confederate contract , but Dumar had opposed it from the very start . The contract itself was a straightforward document , offering humans membership in the Confederacy on two conditions : that we guaranteed never to attack other species in the Confederacy , and that we never pursued weapons research tailored against non-Terran species . If we refused to sign , Earth would be flagged as a prohibited world and our contact with other sentients would cease . Dumar leaned toward me . " Dr. Suzorsky , you were the first linguist to discover the aliens engaged in covert communication . Correct ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essentially accurate . The first seven alien species to visit Earth arrived speaking human languages flawlessly , but disclosed almost nothing of their own languages or technology . When the seventh set of alien visitors , the Eridanians , arrived , I had deduced some simple word elements from their gestural vocabulary . " And as soon as the aliens realized you understood them , . they ceased this covert communication . Correct ? " I nodded . The Eridanians had promptly switched to speaking Mandarin Chinese to one another . " Then you agree that the aliens " behavior is suspicious ? " I took a deep breath . " We do n't know enough about the Eridanians to understand their reluctance to share their language ; perhaps their reasons are cultural or religious- " " How naive , " sneered Dumar . Beside me I heard Holman groan softly , and I knew he was dreading my reaction . Ever since he first hired me , Holman has tried to convince me that diplomacy is an important quality in a xeno-linguist . Dumar templed his hands on the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have more sense . You admit we do n't understand the aliens , but you would have us agree to this contract in blind trust , signing away our right to defend ourselves . " I did n't shout . I did n't raise my voice . " How naive , " I said , " to believe that our defenses would be in any way adequate if the Confederacy chose to attack . Even a child would have more sense . " Dumar 's face turned beet-red . His teeth ground together audibly , and he said something that can be roughly translated as Ignorant Little Girl . " And you 're a paranoid , megalomaniac fool . " For good measure , I repeated myself in French , rather more colorfully . Dumar stood up to leave . Everyone started to speak at once . Holman raised one hand , and said quietly , looking at Dumar , " Please , General , sit down . It 's late . We 're all tired . " Holman has the most expressive voice I 've ever heard , soft and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the council fell silent . " Tempers are frayed . I know that Janna regrets her rudeness . General , your perspective on this situation is greatly valued . Please do n't leave . " And Dumar sat down . Holman kicked me under the table . Hard . I muttered something that approximated to an apology , and the meeting dragged on until one in the morning . When the meeting finally ended I left immediately , leaving Holman still talking to the Chinese representative . I caught the shuttle from Brussels to London , then a taxi to my house . As soon as I walked in the front door , Horatio , my house computer , beeped at me . " Good evening , Janna . You have seven messages waiting . Do you wish to hear them ? " Later . " " Three of the messages are marked as urgent - " " Are they from Holman ? " " Yes . " " Delete them . " I kicked off my shoes and sank into the sofa by the bow window . The last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stared out the window . Outside snow clung to every surface . In the morning the London traffic would turn the snow to brown slush , but for now it was pristine . The rowan tree sagged under the weight , each twig coated to stubby thickness . I rubbed at the ache in my neck . " Horatio , turn up the heating to seventy degrees . " On the table beside me was a game I 'd been given by the Tsilt , the eighth alien race to visit Earth and the first to share their language . I lifted up the alien game , watching the short rods change color as they touched one another . Unlike the other sentients , the Tsiliit had arrived without knowing human languages . For three weeks Holman and I had taught them English as they taught us an alien language . Under the security council 's orders , I had studied the recordings of that visit , searching for signs of duplicity . But all I had seen was the Tsilts " eagerness , their curiosity , and my own face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Through the window I watched a large snowflake drift down to land on the sill , and for the first time I regretted my outburst . Not that I had n't meant every word I 'd said to Dumar , but I should n't have risked antagonizing the rest of the council . It was less than two years since the Tsilts " visit , and already human technology had leapt ahead based on the information we 'd exchanged . If the U.N . signed the contract , other species might be equally forthcoming . If . I set the Tsilt game back down on the table , and fetched the stack of paper-mail , still too wound up to sleep . I opened the first letter : an ad for a credit card . The second was my bank statement . The third envelope was heavy . I pulled out a square of stiff cardboard , and stopped midway . Someone had glued on a photo of me standing beside the Tsilt . Overlaid across the edge of the photo , its muzzle against the image of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Horatio . " My voice shook . " Horatio , switch on the security system . " I turned over the cardboard . A Humans First pamphlet was taped to the back , proclaiming that the contract was a delaying tactic while the aliens prepared to invade . The department sent out monthly warnings about Isolationist extremists , and I 'd seen snippets of the protest marches on the news-cube . But I 'd never taken any of it seriously . I pushed the cardboard away and started opening the rest of my mail . Systematically I unfolded the sheets of paper and stacked them on the table , but I did n't take in a word they said . I thought about calling the police , but it was probably just some teenage kid playing a prank . The department received hate-mail from time to time , and it had never amounted to any more than threatening letters . Yet the house seemed very empty . Part of me wanted to call Holman . We have our ups and downs , but he 'd come over if I explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smug . I could picture his self-satisfied expression , his wide dimpled grin . The grin of someone perfectly ready to offer support but who never needed such support himself . Unbearable . So I could n't call Holman , and I did n't want to stay in the house alone . That left Billy 's pub . I changed into a black pantsuit , and caught a taxi to Billy 's . It was after three A.M. when I arrived . The poker game was still going , though that was the only sign of life . Billy had abandoned his station behind the bar to join in the game with Lara and Marcos . Billy waved me over . " Been auditioning for a horror movie , Janna ? Or are those bags under your eyes a new fashion ? " " I thought I 'd coordinate with your decor , " I said . " Rather the worse for wear . " " Do n't mind Billy , " said Lara . " He 's grouchy because he 's lost eight hands in a row . " Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . Lara dresses like a hooker and plays like a card-sharp . I 'd stake a year 's pay that she knows eight dozen ways to cheat , and another year 's pay that she 's never used any of them at Billy 's . I took the seat between Lara and Marcos . " What 's the game ? " " Jacks to open , nothing wild except red-eyed aliens , " said Marcos . It was nothing , the kind of comment you hear all the time at Billy 's , but I thought of the cardboard letter , and I could n't stop myself from shivering . " You okay , kiddo ? " asked Lara . " Fine . " I picked up my cards , and took a deep breath . As ever the pub smelled of cigarettes , the walls yellowed by years of smoke , familiar , comforting . I pushed a coin forward . " Ten ecus . " BILLY LET ME snatch a few hours sleep in one of the login booths before I went back to work . When I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me a squashed object that might once have been a croissant . I chewed on the maybe-croissant while I sat at the bar , watching the news-cube . The U.N . delegation had announced that they would be meeting the aliens next Thursday . The BBC reporters scrupulously refrained from speculation on whether or not the delegation would sign the contract , but they showed clips of world leaders . The German chancellor blustered about independence , and not kow&lt;owing to the aliens . The Egyptian president stressed the need for a larger military budget . Only the Chinese leader publicly advocated signing but I hoped the others would agree once they were off-camera if only out of fear that the aliens would otherwise renege on their agreement and blast humanity out of existence . I refused to think about the alternative , a world turned inward , walled into a solar system that no one else would ever visit . At ten o'clock I sneaked into my office without being caught by Holman . Before tackling anything else , I emailed an apology to the French general , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ security chief . I skimmed my email , paused when I spotted a message from Lars Svendsen , the man due to captain the fourth ship to Mars . For a moment I forgot all about work and the Confederate contract : when I was growing up I was transfixed by the return to the Moon - the fragile lunar landers , flimsy metal foil envelopes on squat legs ; the astronauts swaddled in their bulky suits ; Earth rising above the lunar landscape . Captain Lars Svendsen , astronaut and future Mars colonist . I read his message : he wanted to meet me tomorrow to discuss a possible project if I could fit him in at such short notice . Of course I could . I was busy rearranging my schedule when someone knocked at the door . " Come in . " " Janna . " Holman stood in the doorway , one hand clamped rigidly round the handle . " I 've just been informed that you received a death threat last night . Why the hell did n't you call me immediately ? " The coldness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a flippant reply . " I did n't consider it a significant danger . " " Then in the future kindly leave such judgments to someone with more experience . " " Fine . If it happens again , I 'll phone the police . Is that satisfactory ? Or do you want to escort me home every night ? " The comer of Holman 's mouth quirked . " That offer has a certain appeal . " He let go of the door handle , the line of his shoulders relaxing . " But if you 'd prefer another companion , the department will pay for a bodyguard . I do n't want you at home alone . Please . " I stared at him : he really was concerned . I had n't thought about it before , but I was the only person Holman ever treated in this big-brother fashion . With the rest of his department he was friendly but more remote . With the women he dated he was suavely insincere . " I do n't need a bodyguard . If you insist , I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Good . " And he left without even mentioning my run-in with General Dumar . My English aunt was out of town , and I did n't want to stay with anyone from the department . In the end I went to a hotel . I did n't like the thought of going back to my house , even briefly , so all I had with me was a toothbrush and a backup change of clothes that I kept at the office . After a shower , I turned on the hotel cube . Lines of men strode down Pall Mall , waving black flags bearing the Isolationist symbol : a silver alien skull with two gaping red eye sockets , one above the other . I switched to the next channel . The same scene , but this time on the streets of Washington DC . A hollow drumbeat sounded , and the men marched in step . I turned off the cube and got into the bed . I was so tired my joints ached , but it took me a long time to fall asleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hollow beat of a drum . THE NEXT MORNING Svendsen arrived at my office a quarter of an hour early . He was a short man in his fifties , with large hands which he waved around energetically as he apologized for being early . " I 'm delighted to meet you . " I gestured at a chair . " Sit down . Can I get you a drink ? " " Yes . No . " He sat down in the chair , stood up again . " Dr. Suzorsky , would you mind if we took a walk outside while we chat ? I have only been to London twice before , never for long . " " Call me Janna . A walk is fine . " So we went outside into a clear , cold February morning . We walked through-Piccadilly Circus and Leicester Square . I grew up in the States , and I relish the long layered history of London . Buildings that date back to the Middle Ages standing toe-to-toe with glass skyscrapers . We walked past street vendors bundled up in overcoats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Dickens , selling hot roast chestnuts , the smell quite wonderful . But others were selling odd little toys modeled after Tsilt artifacts . " What was it you wanted to speak to me about ? " " I want you to invent Martian . " I stared at him . " Martian ? " " Yes , we want a common language for Mars , a language of our own . " " Why ? Why not English , or Esperanto , or Chinese ? Or simply using machine-translation - " " No , this is not the same . To hear each other 's voices , to hear how each word is said , this is better than listening to a translation . " His big hands carved up the air as he spoke , emphasizing each point . " Originally we agreed to learn Spanish , but when I suggested a separate language , one not tied to any particular community , a language for Mars , there was much enthusiasm . Will you do this ? Will you make us a language ? " I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ student . Most of the linguists I knew had experimented with their own artificial language , and to be given the chance to design a language that would really be spoken - " I 'd love to . I 'll have to check with Dr. Holman but I 'm confident he 'll approve the project . " Holman was always eager to promote the department , and a project like this was bound to attract media attention . Svendsen beamed . " Excellent . And if it is possible we would like more than the language alone . " " Such as ? " " Everything . " He laughed , a round cheery sound . " Well , not everything But stories and poetry , and school books for children , all in our new language . I thought machine-translation could be used for this . " " It can , though it wo n't be quite the same . Translations always lose some of the semantics , the flavor of the original . " Some of my joy in the morning deflated at the obvious disappointment in his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the plus side , an artificial language will be relatively easy to learn . We can avoid the irregularities of natural languages . " We headed back toward the department . Svendsen clapped me in a bear-hug when he said goodbye , and for a second I felt like a little girl being hugged by Father Christmas . I told Holman about Svendsen 's request that afternoon . He agreed immediately , and then leaned back in his chair . " You did stay at a friend 's house last night ? " " Yes . " It was the simplest answer . " And you 'll stay with them again tonight ? " " Yes , Daddy . " He frowned . " Janna , I 'm serious . The Isolationists are determined to prevent the signing of the contract . They 're crazy enough to try anything . " He paused . " If you need to go back to your house for any reason , I 'll arrange for someone to accompany you . I could go there with you after work if you like . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and drove me home directly after work . " Good evening , " said Horatio as I opened the door . There was a pile of mail on the doormat . I stepped over the pile , not quite ready to face it . " You have five messages waiting . I ordered fresh milk - " " Horatio : off . " Holman picked up the mail as he stepped inside after me . " Would you like me to sort through this while you pack ? " " Thanks . " I ran upstairs , packed my suitcase . When I came back down Holman had arranged the letters into neat stacks . " Nothing out of the ordinary , " he said . He pointed at the stacks . " Bills , junk mail , a San Francisco postcard from someone with an illegible signature . " I took the postcard from him . " It 's from my sister . " Holman shifted his feet , cleared his throat . " Do you have plans for this evening ? We could have a working dinner , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I liked Holman , though I 'd probably have denied it if he asked . Once I 'd even slept with him , but I 'd recovered my wits in the morning : Holman 's trail was littered with temporary liaisons and I did n't wish to add to the collection . " Just dinner , " said Holman . " I promise not to even mention my spare bedroom with the jacuzzi and the view of Hyde Park . " I thought of the empty hotel room . " All right . Just dinner . " Over the following days the threatening letter receded to the back of my mind . I worked late each evening , intent on Martian . My desk piled up with printouts . I talked to Nadia about optimal phoneme sets , to Jeff about machine-translation to convert existing texts to the language we were creating . When Holman had time , he wrote additional software to aid in the language design . I 'd been doing my best to ignore the news , still uneasy whenever I saw pictures of the Isolationists . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delegation was due to meet the Confederate representatives , I could n't concentrate on work . I kept glancing at the clock . Finally I went to the department lounge to watch the news . The room was already full , everyone crushed in around the news-cube . Holman arrived a few minutes later , and squashed in beside me . The broadcast showed the U.N . delegates taking their places in the new assembly chamber , their suits dappled with colored light from the huge stained-glass dome above . The four aliens entered and stood motionless as the Chinese leader walked down to meet them , the contract rolled up in his hand . Bowing his head , he presented the contract to one of the aliens . The circle of the alien 's mouth irised open and shut as it unwrapped the contract . On the bottom of the page were the seventeen signatures of the U.N . security council . Everyone in the department cheered and whooped and hugged the people around them . Holman held onto me a little longer than necessary . " Have I ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I have a jacuzzi with a view of Hyde Park ? " " Too often , " I said , stepping back . " Does that mean you wo n't celebrate with me tonight ? " " Not if you were planning on an evening just for two . " " Of course not . " He gave me a wide dimpled grin , feigning innocence . " Ptolemy , my cat , is an excellent chaperone . " " Despite that assurance , I think I 'll decline . " That evening I stopped work early for the first time in a week , but I celebrated at Billy 's pub rather than Holman 's apartment . The next day I checked out of the hotel and moved back home , refusing Holman 's offer of a bodyguard . Earth had a flurry of alien guests in the weeks following the signing of the contract . After a failed bomb attempt by the Isolationists , security for the guests tripled . No one was quite sure how the Confederacy would react if the Isolationists succeeded in injuring one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interpret it as a breach of the contract . Early in April Svendsen phoned . " The Aki have asked me to meet with them on Wednesday , " he said over the phone . " Apparently they are curious about the Mars colony . Would you consider accompanying me ? This will be my first meeting with aliens ; perhaps I might make some foolish blunder by myself . " " I 'm sure you would n't , but I 'll come if you like . " " The meeting is to be in London . It will be no more than a few hours of your time . So you will come ? " " Yes . " " Excellent . " Wednesday was a cool spring day . The crocuses were open in the parks , the air sweet with blossom . Svendsen was n't one to waste such fine weather . The pair of Aki agreed to a walk by the Thames , and the four of us set off , surrounded by a phalanx of U.N . soldiers . The Aki came from a planet with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to assist their movements , and the skeletons made a constant low-pitched hum as we walked by the river . Svendsen and the two Aid talked incessantly , one speaking faster than the other . I followed along behind them , content to listen , watching how Svendsen punctuated his sentences with sweeping gestures . The group paused opposite the Houses of Parliament . The late afternoon sunlight brushed the old buildings to a golden-brown . The U.N . soldiers stood in a protective semicircle backed by a broad wall overlooking the river . I sat on the wall , and glanced down at the river that gave birth to London over two millennia ago , when the Romans chose it as a suitable crossing point of the River Thames in 43 AD . I smiled at the contrast between that image and Svendsen , future Martian colonist , standing here talking to the Aki . A tiny glowing red dot crept along the stone sidewaLk . I blinked , swiveled round to see something sparkle high-up in the Houses of Parliament . Odd . I ca n't describe it any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I saw the red dot track over the stone , angling toward the nearest Aki . I jumped up , yelling something , pushed the Aki down . I heard the sound of a bone snapping , and that detached part of my mind noted that the Aki exoskeleton is fragile , adapted to a lower gravity . And then there was a sharp heat spreading down from my lower back . Holman was there when I first woke up . He grinned like a little boy when I opened my eyes . That 's the first and best thing that I remember from the next few days . I 'd prefer to forget the reporters who squeezed into the hospital ward to snap pictures of my backside cocooned in bioplaster , all the hate-mail from Isolationists , and , almost as bad , the letters of praise from well-meaning strangers . If I 'd had more time to consider what I was doing , I would probably have ducked out of the way . On the fourth day Holman told me that the assassin 's body had been found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joined the Isolationists two years ago . His fingerprints matched those on the old-fashioned laser-rifle found earlier . The police declared the case closed with uncharacteristic haste . But one of the U.N . investigators told Holman privately that they suspected alien involvement . I thought about that a lot as I lay in bed . I had plenty of time to think , and it was n't a comfortable experience . General Dumar had been correct up to a point . I had been naive , assuming the aliens were trustworthy because that was what I wanted to believe . I thought about Holman , remembering the one night I made love to him , wondering what it would be like to stay together , wondering whether we could ever return to being friends if a relationship did n't work out , and whether it was worth that risk . I thought about Lars Svendsen , and the way I had immediately leapt at the chance to invent a language , without considering whether that was really what he needed . I asked Holman to buy me a Latin grammar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lars , a richer language than I could give you , with stories and speeches and poetry , and a history that wo n't end as long as someone speaks it . Good luck . " I like to think of the colonists on Mars , reading Virgil and Cicero and Pliny . It 's a curious thought , the colonists speaking a long-dead language on a long-dead world as they carve out a new history . Through my work I have had the chance to speak with alien visitors . But it 's people like the colonists who will one day go and seek them out . Yes , alien contact does carry risks , but I think it 's better than solitary confinement in our solar system , only able to guess at the universe beyond our doorstep . They discharged me from hospital at the end of April , and three nights later I took Holman to Billy 's pub . It 's only so long before you get bored of a jacuzzi and a view of Hyde Park . My bottom was still sore , but life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the poker . " Lost a fight ? " asked Billy , staring at my padded backside . " And you 're looking as ugly as ever too , " I told him , gingerly sitting down . Big Al started dealing . " Stud poker . One-eyed jacks are wild . " With one long red fingernail , Lara flicked up the edge of her hole card just enough to see it . " Shit . I fold . " I breathed in slowly , taking it all in , Holman and Billy , Big Al and Marcos and Chen . Lara dressed to kill . The worn green baize , the smell of cigarettes . As classically perfect as strawberries at Wimbledon . I sighed with contentment.
