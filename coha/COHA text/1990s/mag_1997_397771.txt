Forty years ago , a group of nine Black students , now known as the Little Rock Nine , courageously desegregated the all-White Central High School as they entered the school with armed escorts . On the 40th anniversary of that landmark day , President Bill Clinton stood at the door and opened it for them . The president urged Americans to again push back the barriers of racism . " Segregation is no longer the law , but too often separation is still the rule , " Clinton told the 2,000 people gathered on the front lawn of the Little Rock , AR , school . " Forty years ago today they climbed these steps , passed through this door and moved our nation , " he continued . " And for that , we must all thank them . " In 1957 the controversial battle elevated when Arkansas Gov . Orval Faubus went against court orders and ordered the Arkansas National Guard to keep the Black students from desegregating the school . The standoff lasted a tense three weeks . President Dwight Eisenhower then sent members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Sept. 25 . When they passed through the front doorway of Central High School , the Little Rock Nine endured jeers , threats and were spit upon as they attended school . " If those nine children could walk up those steps 40 years ago all alone , if their parents could send them into the storm armed only with schoolbooks and the righteousness of their cause , then surely we can build a better America , " Clinton said . " Let us resolve to stand on the shoulders of the Little Rock Nine .

" Today , children of every race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk down different halls , " Clinton said . " Not only in this school , but across America , they sit in different classrooms , they eat at different tables . They even sit in different parts of the bleachers at the football game . " Far too many communities are all White , all Black , all Latino , all Asian . Indeed , too many Americans of all races have actually begun to give up on the idea of integration and the search for common ground . " The President continued , " There are still people who ca n't get over it , who ca n't let it go , who ca n't go through the day unless they have somebody else to look down on . And it manifests itself in our streets and in our neighborhoods , and in the workplace , and in the schools . And it is wrong . And we have to keep working on it , not just with our voices , but with our laws . And we have to engage each other in it .
