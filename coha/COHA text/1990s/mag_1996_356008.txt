Ask James Girolamo , 5 , or Everett Webre , a mature 4 , which Saturday-morning television shows they like best , and they will look at you blankly as though you were quizzing them about hedge funds or Harold Pinter . The boys , no budding back-to-the-landers , are the sons of TV-friendly Manhattan media professionals , but neither James nor Everett has ever watched Saturday-morning cartoons . " This is family time , " explains Everett 's mom Priscilla Glover , " one of the few times during the week we can all be together . Everett knows he can watch the Disney Channel whenever he wants , so he does n't beg to glue himself to the TV on the weekends . He does n't even know what he is missing . " <P> The broadcast networks , however , are all too aware of what Everett is missing , and they are desperate to do something about it . Distracted by home videos , computer games and round-the-clock cable channels such as Disney , the Cartoon Network and most significantly of all , Nickelodeon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grownups shunning whole milk . For the first six weeks of the new season , on average 4.16 million kids 2 to 11 years old tuned into Saturday-morning network shows , down 20% from last season , according to Nielsen Media Research , and a whopping 60% from 1986 . During the past year alone , CBS has lost 50% of its young Saturday-morning viewers , the WB network 26% , and Fox 9% , even though it carries the thriller series Goosebumps , TV 's highest-rated children 's program . ( Seeing the writing on the wall , NBC dropped its kids ' programming altogether four years ago . ) <P> " I 'm worried , " concedes Margaret Loesch , chairman of Fox Kids Networks Worldwide . " There are only a certain number of kids , and with more and more programming services , the ratings pie is being sliced into too many pieces . " <P> And Nickelodeon is gaining a big chunk . As the networks have watched their ratings dwindle , Nick has seen its Saturday-morning audience grow 23.5% during the past year . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many times , " argues Nickelodeon president Herb Scannell . " They do n't care about kids , and kids are feeling that . " <P> Well , not exactly . Nick is n't leaping ahead with the sort of innovative live-action fare it serves up in the evenings ( The Secret World of Alex Mack ) but rather with repeats of its weekday cartoons like the clever Rugrats , as well as reruns of older Saturday-morning shows that were canceled by the major networks years ago . " When Nickelodeon is able to beat broadcast networks with repeats of Muppet Babies and Beetlejuice , " notes Jamie Kellner. head of the WB , " it suggests the matter goes far beyond programming . " <P> Indeed , part of the networks ' strategy to lure back Saturday-morning viewers focuses on copying a big secret of Nickelodeon 's success : promotion , promotion , promotion . Fox , for example , has tripled the marketing and promotion budget , in part to advertise its kids ' fare on cable and radio stations . ABC is now using its prime-time Friday-night block @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promote shows airing the next morning .
