<p> Only a few years ago , a fondness for faded English chintz developed into near cult proportions on two continents . It was the start of the Eighties , a decade that promised the trappings of prosperity to ever-widening circles . Hordes of anglophiles found themselves reaching for the faded cabbage rose . It was that pale emblem , upholstered on plump old chairs in the slightly decaying stately homes of the English countryside , that came to symbolize the inherited wealth , property , manners and impeccable taste of the upper class . <p> Throughout the ' 80s , the lesser classes were buying new chintz and desperately dipping it in tea to get the old look . Today , the rose blooms on sofa beds and recliners across suburbia . <p> Ironically , it was a wealthy transplanted American , Nancy Lancaster , who was behind it all . By then , she was living in retirement in a cottage at the edge of her former country property in Oxfordshire . It was there on Aug. 19 , amid her quintessentially English garden , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ever the epitome of understated blueblood style . A private memorial service will be held next week in a historic chapel near Charlottesville and her beloved childhood home . <p> What is remarkable about Lancaster , a Virginian by birth , is that she distilled the essence of upper-class English country life so perfectly and turned it , through her firm Colefax &; Fowler , into a decorating motif so true that even the British succumbed . <p> A continent away in New York , Lancaster 's lifelong friend Sister Parish was doing similar business as the old-line Parish-Hadley decorating firm . Cozy splendor was her specialty , pairing humble handwoven baskets with lofty $ 150,000 breakfronts . Parish had begun convincing her society clients that good taste meant toning down rather than playing up their rare antiques . <p> " It was the dream of every person who had come upon cash to have their house decorated by Sister Parish , " says Paige Rense , editor-in-chief of Architectural Digest , which published a spread on " The World of Mrs. Henry Parish II " in 1981 . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to toss a hand-stitched quilt from Appalachia at the foot of the priceless heirloom bed , put a rustic rag rug on the floor , display folk art . It was Parish who gave the rest of America the courage to celebrate their heritage as style . <p> Parish , like Lancaster , was born into a world of privilege and continuity . She once recalled her first journey as an unconscious " first lesson in good things . " At the age of 15 days , she was transported by train in a simple white wicker basket to the family summer home in Dark Harbor on Islesboro Island , Maine . It was during summers there that she met the Virginian who became Nancy Lancaster , a frequent visitor on nearby 700 Acre Island . And it was in Maine on Sept. 8 , three weeks after Lancaster 's death , that Parish died of complications of pneumonia . She was 84 . <p> Parish once explained her philosophy by saying , " Innovation is often the ability to reach into the past and bring back what is good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is lasting . " Until she entered the hospital for the last time , she had spent her summer in the yellow clapboard house overlooking the water in the maple four poster in which she was born , surrounded by her painted furniture and her spatterware . <p> Working simultaneously but separately over six decades on two continents , Nancy Lancaster and Sister Parish revolutionized the look of American rooms and left enduring marks on 20th-century interior design . Cabbage roses . Rush carpeting , the forerunner of sisal . Mattress ticking as upholstery . Skirted tables . Baggy slipcovers . Cross-stitch rugs . Ottomans . <p> The two women were style pioneers , though neither ever formally studied design . Both were born into aristocratic families , exuded style , had talent and the inbred sense of comfort that comes with wealth . But each in her own way , and based on first-hand experience of a vanishing upper-crust lifestyle , inspired a design vocabulary and way of arranging houses and gardens that mapped the course of decorating in England and America for 60 years . <p> " Above all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with simplicity , " says Evangeline Bruce , a Lancaster friend for 50 years and an occasional Colefax &; Fowler client . " Nothing was self-conscious and nothing looked decorated . Everything was played down . " <p> If Lancaster will be remembered as the mother of the English country-house style , Parish is the one who launched an American country style that remains a national favorite . Her Maine houses  --  there were at least four  --  were filled with signature details , such as checkered cotton , needlework pillows , dog paintings , hand-woven afghans and painted floors . Even in more formal settings , she would combine vintage needlepoint carpets , coromandel screens and crystal chandeliers with twig baskets and slipcovers made of mattress ticking . But as with many things American , some of her inspiration came from England  --  a good chunk from her friend Nancy Lancaster , who knew how to bend tradition . <p> " Nancy Lancaster took a gilded Adam chair and put chintz on it , " said New York designer David Anthony Easton , who once worked for Parish . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their imitators , however , both Lancaster and Parish knew when to stop . Their names may be associated with chintz , but they used it discreetly . <p> Parish had no qualms about imposing her views . She loathed " boring brown furniture . " She also was known for " tea carting . " As new clients watched in terror , Parish , as legend has it , would command a rolling tea cart around their rooms . When it was filled with the accessories she deemed tacky , they were whisked away , never to be seen again . <p> " They were both very brave , " says designer Mark Hampton , a chronicler of decorating history and one of the many A-list designers who once worked for Parish 's firm . " They were not ' fraidy cats . ' " <p> Lancaster was born Nancy Keene Perkins on Sept. 10 , 1897 , at Mirador , her grandfather 's house in Greenwood , Va . Her parents were meat-packing executive T. Moncure Perkins and Elizabeth " Lizzie " Langhorne , who had several celebrated sisters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Lady Nancy Astor , the first woman elected to the British House of Commons . <p> Nancy Lancaster spent her childhood in Virginia , except for two years when her mother , determined that her two daughters marry diplomats , took them abroad to learn French . In 1915 , she graduated from the Foxcroft School where she studied traditional subjects plus the niceties of curtsying , entering a room like a lady , and beagling  --  fox-hunting with beagles . <p> She married three times ; in 1918 to Marshall Field 's grandson , Henry Field , who died six months later ; in 1920 to Ronald Tree , his cousin and heir to the same department store fortune and later a member of Parliament . Lancaster and Tree had two children , but were divorced after 27 years . The following year , she married Claude Lancaster , whose name she kept though the union lasted only a year or so . <p> Claude Lancaster had rented his 18th-century country house , Kelmarsh Hall , to Nancy and Ronald Tree when they moved to England in 1926 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a bathroom for each bedroom . <p> Seven years later , the Trees bought Ditchley Park , a 1722 Georgian masterpiece in Oxfordshire , complete with the original tapestries and William Kent furniture . It was during the ensuing years that Lancaster came into her own as a taste-maker , her advice on gardens as well as houses sought by relatives and well-connected friends . A 1937 ball for 1,000 guests at which the women all wore red or white was the talk of society . Winston Churchill was a frequent guest during the Blitz . <p> At the end of the war , Lancaster bought Lady Sibyl Colefax 's design firm and shop , Sibyl Colefax Ltd. , and joined forces with a prominent London decorator Colefax had employed , John Fowler . Renamed Colefax &; Fowler , the firm worked on many stately houses , including a derelict 18th-century property in Oxfordshire called Haseley Court , which Lancaster purchased in 1954 . <p> " The first time I saw her she was wearing a full-length fitted ermine coat with a scarlet lining and an enormous ermine toque , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assistant in the 1950s . " She looked like Catherine the Great . " <p> According to Irvine , Lancaster was the rainmaker with the big ideas , and Fowler , who died in 1977 , was the talented decorator who knew how to execute them . " John had all the greatest houses crossing his path . It was because of Nancy Lancaster who had such a flair and with her American money could fix up houses and persuade her rich American buddies to buy and fix theirs up . " <p> Although British families with the wherewithal were determined to fix up their grand properties , many country houses were on the block  --  their owners impoverished , exhausted by war , and without the enormous staffs required to run the stately homes . <p> A study by the Historic Buildings Council documented the state of affairs . " In 1953 , it is no exaggeration to say that the prevalent attitude ... among owners of large houses , was one almost of despair . " It went on to say that even prospects of government grants toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stem the flight from the big house and the sale of its contents . " Americans , on the other hand , many of them married to Britons , had money . <p> Although Lancaster and Fowler often fought , they collaborated on several projects . Their most famous were the Gothic chapel at Haseley Court , which they frescoed the dusty apricot color of villas in the Vicenza and converted to a bedroom in 1956 , and the Yellow Room , Lancaster 's magnificent Mayfair pied-a ' - terre , completed in 1958 and first published in 1962 . With its glossy butter-colored walls , unlined taffeta curtains and sheepskin scatter rugs , it has been described as the very " yardstick of British style . " The color has inspired many , including Bruce , who says she had " shamelessly copied " the color of the Yellow Room both in her Georgetown dining room and in her home in Beijing in the 1970s , when her late husband , David K. E. Bruce , was U.S. chief of liaison . <p> Another person taken with the Yellow Room was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the early ' 60s , Buatta was working as an assistant to Irvine when he made a visit to England and was introduced to Fowler , Lancaster and the Yellow Room . <p> " I just went crazy , " says Buatta . " I had never seen such played-down grandeur . " <p> The room 's powerful influence is evident in Buatta 's published work as early as 1969 : yellow walls , pillows , ribbons , paintings of dogs , yards of English chintz . Throughout the ' 70s and ' 80s , he used enough of the floral fabric to earn him the title " Prince of Chintz " and now has his own line of chintzes . It was Buatta who spread chintz at Blair House when he and Mark Hampton redecorated the presidential guest house in 1988 . <p> Parish 's Beginnings <p> Sister Parish often has been described as the most famous living American decorator . She was born in Morristown , N.J. , in July 15 , 1910 , as Dorothy May Kinnicutt , but the childhood nickname , Sister , preferred by her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a collector and often took her antiquing . Parish 's mother had a very strict sense of order and filled her houses with family treasures  --  photographs in silver frames , old white wicker and Staffordshire animals . <p> Like Lancaster , Parish attended Foxcroft , then married a promising Wall Street stockbroker , Henry Parish II , in 1930 . They moved to a completely decorated Manhattan home , a wedding gift from her parents . They had three children . <p> Parish was 23 in 1933 , when tough times during the Depression moved her to open a decorating business in a one-room cottage near their country home in Far Hills , N.J. The first client to walk through the door had a decorating budget of $ 100,000 . <p> Other than Elsie de Wolfe and British designer , Syrie Maugham , most decorating at this time was being done by firms , not individuals . But Sister Parish 's reputation grew steadily , and by the time she moved her office to Manhattan after World War II , she was known in certain circles for a polished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ included Whitneys , Paleys , Gettys and the Kennedy White House . <p> " Mrs. Parish would tell me that she sometimes would n't know a Louis from a George , but that she did know what was right from what was wrong , " says Libby Cameron , a Parish-Hadley designer originally from Washington . <p> Parish worked on her own for 29 years before she took on Albert Hadley , already known for his work at the McMillen firm . She added Hadley 's name to her own company 's , becoming Parish-Hadley in 1963 . Until early this year , Parish went to the office on most days . <p> " The older Mrs. Parish became , the less timid her rooms became , " says Hampton . " Her rooms just got stronger and bolder . It was fearless use of color and pattern . " <p> Parish was known as well for her colorful personality , which inspired the character of haughty society decorator Cora Mandell in Dominick Dunne 's 1988 roman a ' clef , " People Like Us . " Parish was delighted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking forward to playing herself attending a glittering party at the Metropolitan Museum in a film version of the book , but the scene was never shot . <p> " She intimidated people , " says Rense , who left the firm out of AD 's list of 100 top decorators . ( She denied there was a rift , but noted that most of Parish-Hadley 's projects in the 1980s were offered to HG , not Architectural Digest . ) " She was like the lioness who pretended to be a lamb . I have heard her clients , even grand people , who were terrified by her . She was imposing ... even though she spoke in a whispery voice . " <p> The dignified Parish was said to resemble a more " patrician " Ethel Barrymore . She and her Pekingese were chauffeured daily to her East Side office , Sister in the front , dogs in back . In the office , they sat in special baskets upholstered in mattress ticking . The dogs were driven home when Parish decided a meeting was too boring . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training grounds for top designers . In addition to Hampton , Easton and Irvine , Parish-Hadley alumni include William Hodgins , Kevin McNamara and Bunny Williams . The firm has had many Washington clients : Sen. Jay and Sharon Rockefeller ( D-W . Va . ) , Bill and Buffy Cafritz , and Al and Tipper Gore at the vice-president 's residence . Colefax &; Fowler trained Nina Campbell and Nicholas Haslam . The firm 's clients have included Buckingham Palace and the Queen Mother . <p> The firms ' success , says Albert Hadley , now 73 , came when the time was ripe for a style that was romantic . " It was a swing of the pendulum that quite naturally followed that period in the ' 60s when everything was modern and pared down , " he said . " Most people ca n't live that way . " <p> It was partly the Royal Wedding , in 1981 , that generated U.S. interest in British style . Millions of Americans tuned in to the opulent 11-part British television series " Brideshead Revisited , " filmed at Castle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the National Gallery of Art opened the " Treasure Houses of Britain " exhibit , the look was becoming almost a self-parody . Rooms from Leeds to Las Vegas were drowning in chintz . <p> Americans put their spin on the look but without the faded fabrics , the worn leather wing chairs , the unpolished silver and brass and the requisite dog hairs . At its most extreme , it is the Bavardages ' grossly overdone dining room with 14 coats of burnt apricot lacquer and rustic Appalachian basket centerpieces immortalized by Tom Wolfe 's 1987 novel " Bonfire of the Vanities . " <p> Lancaster and Parish considered their look to be timeless , though only time will tell . " A quieter approach may be more in the ascendancy now , " says Louis Oliver Gropp , editor-in-chief of House Beautiful magazine , and editor of House and Garden when it published Lancaster 's Yellow Room . " The pendulum does swing . " <p> That ' Lived In ' Look <p> It 's hard to imagine what things were like before , except maybe for Sister Parish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a quilt was a beautiful thing , " she told AD in 1981 . " When I started , putting flowers in a basket was unheard of . " <p> Ultimately , for both designers , the lived-in , Old Money and very WASP look was key . ( Parish put pink blush linings in her lampshades " to make the rich look healthy . " ) In Lancaster 's rooms , there would be " straw carpets next to boulle  --  that 's the fanciest brass and tortoise shell furniture you can imagine  --  and next to it , a painted country piece , " says Buatta . " She and Sister were my greatest influences . " <p> Because Parish 's clients shunned publicity , her work was known only in wealthy circles until she decorated the White House for the Kennedys , having done their homes in Georgetown and Hyannisport . ( One misguided headline writer penned " Kennedys Pick Nun to Decorate White House . " ) <p> Her firm frequently participated in the Kips Bay and Southampton decorator show houses . And Parish-Hadley made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Parish-Hadley collection of tufted sofas and red lacquer canopy beds . <p> Parish was a well-known figure in New York society and enjoyed entertaining in her colorful , cozy Fifth Avenue maisonette , which once belonged to Gloria Swanson . Until last year , she regularly invited friends in for casual Sunday night drinks , where she held court from the corner of a comfortable sofa with a glass of vodka and Clamato juice beside her . She was n't a cook , but one of her favorite recipes was the unlikely combination of Velveeta , chicken bouillon and sherry soup , which she served in Wedgewood cream soup bowls . <p> Although Parish was known for withering glances , she had a wicked sense of humor and Buatta says she " roared " when he gave her a " Twisted Sister " heavy metal album as a birthday gift . <p> Crossing Paths <p> Parish 's annual London visit always included visits to the Colefax showroom and the country homes of her friends John Fowler and Nancy Lancaster . There was talk of the two firms joining forces , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Virginia 's Stratford Hall , the birthplace of Robert E. Lee , where Parish decorated a guest house and Lancaster , who flew the Confederate flag over her English homes and served on the Stratford board for 20 years , decorated the library . Lancaster was notorious for issuing edicts on everything there from the color of the curtains to the taste of the turnip greens and Virginia sausage . <p> Lancaster loathed being called a decorator , and did not formally enter the business until 1944 , 11 years after Parish hung out her shingle in New Jersey . Lancaster brought a practical and totally American sense of comfort to the cold musty English rooms  --  and finally gave the Brits some decent bathrooms , complete with rugs and fireplaces . With her love of romantic antebellum plantations and gardens that had never recovered from the Civil War , she respected the British passion for things that looked a little timeworn . She sought out 100-year-old chintz and , according to designer Keith Irvine , she " bought 17th-and 18th-century lacquered pieces but only if badly looked after , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in the same key . " Borders , " she said , " should look like old ladies ' petticoats . " She told Colefax partner Imogen Taylor , " I like things a little rundown , " and Taylor responded , " I know . It 's really the shabby chic we 've all been trying to emulate all these years . " <p> In the end , it was Virginia that Lancaster loved best . Not long ago , Barrie McIntyre , a British design archivist , asked her which of her many houses she would choose to live in if she had to do it over . " Without any hesitation , " he says , " she answered ' Mirador . ' " Lancaster had used the house frequently until World War II , then lent it to admirals and British diplomats , but was forced to sell it in 1955 . <p> Often photographed wearing broad-brimmed hats and her tiaras at a jaunty angle , Lancaster was known for memorable pronouncements . " The thing about decorating is , I 'm agin it . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said in her clipped , aristocratic British accent . <p> " If you have a red room , it must have a blue ceiling  --  blue the color of the atmosphere , " she told her friend Vernon Edenfield , director of Kenmore , a house museum in Fredericksburg . <p> After selling her Haseley manor house in 1975 , Lancaster moved to " Coach House , " a cottage on the property , filling it with simple painted furniture , but retaining access to her walled garden . Seven years later , she sold the contents of the Yellow Room . <p> She frequently corresponded with Edenfield , who was glad to provide her with all the necessities she could n't find in England , such as hearth brooms and rock crystal swizzle sticks for her whiskey . One letter to him , on pale blue stationery , explained , " I had a marvelous time buying all these things . Now I have to eat them . " <p> Her prized possessions found fine new addresses . From the Yellow Room , Buatta bought a chandelier , and Oscar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now holds a pair of Elizabethan portraits . Bruce got four Gothic chairs from Haseley Court . <p> Lancaster gave her first and last TV interview in 1993 , a BBC profile called " An English Woman 's Garden , " which Parish viewed not long before she died . In it , an elegantly behatted Lancaster in a motorized wheelchair gave a tour of her Haseley cottage garden , quipping that her interviewers would be more useful deadheading her roses than asking her all those questions . <p> Their Decorating Legacy <p> Sister Parish and Nancy Lancaster left a legacy far beyond the rarefied circles of their wealthy clientele . The ideas they introduced to the decorating establishment decades ago  --  some revived , some new  --  now are common features in popular decorating magazines , stores , mail-order catalogues and homes across America . Among them : <p> Quilts <p> Baggy slipcovers <p> Mattress ticking and white duck as upholstery fabric <p> Antlers <p> Chintz , authentic and reissued 18th- and 19th-century florals .
