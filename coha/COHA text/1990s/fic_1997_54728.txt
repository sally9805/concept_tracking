Here 's the first in our trio of cover stories . Mike Resnick is a Hugo-and Nebula-award winning author . He 's also been nominated for the Best Editor Hugo for the editing he 's done on a wide variety of anthologies , including an excellent alternate history series published by Tor . <p> " The Gefilte Fish Girl " is n't alternate history . It 's fantasy , but not necessarily of the dreamy kind . <p> So I walk up to her and say , " Ma , we got ta talk . " <p> And she never looks up from the TV , and she says , " Not during Homemakers ' Jamboree , Marvin . " <p> And I say , " Ma , I 'm Milton . Marvin is your goniff brother who is serving six to ten for passing bogus bills . " ( Which he is . He 's a great artist , even the judge admitted that , but he just does n't do his homework , and printing a bunch of twenties with Andrew Johnson 's picture on them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) <p> Anyway , she says , " Marvin , Milton , what 's the difference , and did you know that Liz Taylor is getting married again ? What is it for her now  --  the thirty-fourth time ? " <p> And I say , " You know , Ma , it 's funny you should bring that up . " <p> And she says , " Funny ? Okay , Mister Big Shot , tell me what 's so funny . Are you the one she 's marrying ? Go ahead , make my day . " <p> And I say , " Lots of people get married , Ma . Some of them even get married to women who are n't Liz Taylor , hard as that may be for you to believe . " <p> And she says , " Lots of mature people , Melvin . " <p> And I say , " Melvin is my cousin who ran off with the gay lion tamer from the circus . I 'm Milton , and speaking of mature , I 'm thirty-four years old . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's thirty-four years old would know to change his socks without being told . " Suddenly she curses and says , " See ? You made me miss today 's health tip . Here I sit , waiting to go to the hospital for a nerve transplant from all the tsouris you cause me , and I ca n't even watch my television in peace . " <p> So I say , " You 're in great shape , Ma . Every artery 's as hard as a rock . " <p> " Feh ! " she says . " God has reserved a special place in hell for ungrateful sons . " <p> " I know , " I say . " It 's probably right next to where He puts all the henpecked husbands . " <p> " Do n't you go making fun of my dear departed Erwin , " she says . <p> " I was n't , " I say . " And besides , all we know is that he departed in one hell of a hurry . We do n't know for sure that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't , he should be , that momser ! " she says . <p> Well , I can see the thought that he may be alive and God forbid enjoying himself is about to drive her wild , so I try to mollify her . <p> " Okay , okay , " I say , hoping the Lord is otherwise occupied and does not hear what I am about to say . " May God Himself strike me dead if he 's not your late husband . " <p> " Well , he was late for most things , " she agrees , leaning back in her chair . " Except in the bedroom . " <p> I try to change the subject again . <p> " We were talking about marriage , " I say . <p> " Someday , when you 're old enough , " she says , " you 'll get married and ruin some poor Jewish girl 's happiness , just the way your dear departed father ruined mine , and the only good thing that will come of it will be a grandson who , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his grandfather but will show me a little respect and compassion . " <p> I begin to see that this is going to be even more difficult than I thought , and I try to come up with a subtle way to break the news to her . So I think , and I think , and I think some more , and finally I say , as subtly as I can , " Ma , I 'm engaged . " <p> And she looks away from the television set and takes her feet off the hassock and plants them on the floor , and stares at me for maybe thirty seconds , and finally she says , " Engaged to do what ? " <p> " To get married , " I say . <p> She digs into her sewing kit , which is on the floor next to her , and pulls out a scissors . <p> " Here , " she says , handing it to me . " Why waste all afternoon rushing me to the hospital 's cardiac unit ? Just stab me now and be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I ask . <p> " Schmendrick ! " she says . " How can the fruit of my looms talk to me like this ? " <p> " I 'm the fruit of your loins , Ma , " I tell her . " Fruit of the Loom is what I 'm wearing beneath my pants . " <p> " All right , " she says . " Just stand there and watch me breathe my last . " <p> " Your last what ? " I ask . <p> She glares at me and finally says , " Before 1 die , at least tell me the name of this female person you 're engaged to do whatever with . " <p> " Melora of the Purple Mist , " I say . <p> " Melora of the Purple Mist ? " she repeats . " How can I fit all that on a wedding invitation ? " <p> " Just use Melora , " I say . <p> " And what bowling alley or topless club did you meet Miss What's-her-name of the Purple Mist at ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , kind of , " I answer . <p> " I knew it ! " she says , poking a pudgy forefinger into the air . " I knew I should never let you take that job with the sewage company ! " <p> " It 's a salvage company , " I say . <p> " Sewage , salvage , what 's the difference ? " she demands . " It 's that Gypsy who walks around half-naked with her deathless beauty sagging down to her pupik , right ? I told you she had her sights set on you ! " <p> " She 's not a Gypsy , and it 's not her . She 's just another diver . " <p> " So you 're marrying some other girl who lies around on deck with her tuchis soaking up the sun , " she says . " I should feel better about that ? " <p> " She does n't lie around on deck , " I say uneasily . <p> " On deck , below deck , big difference , " she snaps . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The truth of it is , she spends most of her time about fifty feet below deck . " <p> " So she 's a diver , " she says . <p> " Not exactly , " I answer . <p> " What , then ? " <p> " Try not to get real excited , Ma , " I say . <p> " I 'm not excited , I have convulsions all the time , " she says . " Just tell me . " <p> " She 's a mermaid , " I say . <p> " As long as she 's not that Gypsy girl , " she says , fanning herself with the TV Guide . " Or that lady bartender from last summer . Or the bug woman . " <p> " The entomologist , " I correct her . <p> " Whatever , " she says . " So tell me about this Purple Mist person . " <p> " Like I said , she 's a mermaid . " <p> " Like what has a tail and spends her whole life in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , " I say . <p> " Does she wear a bra ? " she says suddenly . <p> " Ma ! " I say , outraged . <p> " You heard me  --  does she wear a bra ? " <p> " No , " I finally answer . <p> " Figures , " she says . <p> " What a thing to ask ! " I say . <p> " What do you want me to ask ? " she says . " My son comes home and tells me he 's marrying someone who 's covered with scales and spends all her time swimming in salt water , despite what it must do to her complexion . So can she at least get us a price on fresh fish ? " <p> " It 's not something I 'm real concerned with , " I say . <p> " Of course not , " she says . " You 're as impractical as your late father . " She sighs . " All right , so where did this female person go to school ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say . <p> " Ah ! " she says with a knowing nod . " Rich family with a private tutor . What temple do they belong to ? " <p> " Who ? " <p> " Her family , " she says . " Try to pay attention , Martin . " <p> " Martin is your nephew who went broke manufacturing the folding waterbed , " I say . " I 'm Milton , remember ? " <p> " Do n't change the subject , " she says . " What temple do they go to ? " <p> " They do n't , " I say . <p> " They 're Reformed ? " she asks . <p> I take a deep breath and say , " They 're not Jewish at all , " and then I wait for the explosion . <p> It takes about three one-millionths of a second  --  a new record . <p> " You 're marrying a shiksa ? " she bellows . <p> " I 'm marrying a mermaid , " I say . <p> " Who cares about that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm having a coronary ! " <p> " Ma , try to understand  --  there are n't any Jewish mermaids , " I say . <p> " It 's my fault ? " she demands . " It 's bad enough that you want to give me grandsons with fins  --  and how in the world will the rabbi perform the bris ?  --  but now you tell me that their mother 's a goy ? " <p> " I knew I was gon na have trouble with you , " I say unhappily . <p> " Trouble ? " she shrieks . " Why should there be trouble ? Your Uncle Nate will come by with a knife and a cracker and say , ' Is this a jar of beluga caviar ? ' and I 'll say ' No , it 's forty thousand of my grandchildren . ' " <p> " Will you at least meet her ? " I ask . <p> " Some conversation we 'll have , " she replies . " She 'll say ' Blub ! ' I 'll say ' Gurgle ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll say ' I 'm getting the folds , ' and she 'll say  --  " <p> " That 's the bends , not the folds , " I explain . <p> " Bends , folds , what 's the difference ? " she says . " I plan to be dead of a heart attack in two more minutes . " <p> " She speaks English , " I say , getting back to the subject . <p> " She does ? " <p> " With a beautiful lilting accent . " <p> " I knew it ! " she says . " You 're too young to remember , but they drove our people out of Lilting before the last war ... " <p> " Lilting is n't a place , Ma , " I say . <p> " It is n't ? " she says suspiciously . " Are you sure of that ? " <p> " I 'm sure , " I say . " She really wants to meet you . " <p> " I 'll just bet she does , " she says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lobster . " <p> " I do n't think lobsters eat people , " I say . <p> " Aha ! " she says . " But you do n't know ! " <p> " We 're getting off the subject , " I say . <p> " Right , " she agrees . " The subject was my imminent death . " <p> " The subject was Melora . " <p> " What does this fish person who does n't wear a bra want with you anyway ? " she demands . " Why does n't she go elope with some nice halibut ? " <p> " I met her while I was hunting for treasure , " I say . " It was love at first sight . " <p> " So what you 're saying is that you went down there looking for gold and what you came up with was a female person of the Purple Mist ? " <p> " You 're making this very difficult , Ma . " <p> " You bring home a cod for dinner , and instead of cooking it I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making this difficult ? " she says , just a bit hysterically . <p> I figure it 's time to play my ace in the hole , so I say , " She 's willing to convert , Ma . " <p> " Into what  --  a woman with two or more legs ? " <p> " To Judaism , " I say . " I told her how important it was to you . " <p> " How can she convert ? " she says . " Do we know any rabbis who can hold services fifty feet under the water ? " <p> " She can come to the surface , " I say . " How else would we talk ? " <p> " When did you ever talk to a girl ? " she says . " You 're just like your departed father . " <p> " We talk all the time , " I say . <p> She considers this and finally nods her head . " I suppose there 's not a lot else you can do . " <p> " Do n't get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raises her eyes to the heavens  --  which are just beyond the lightbulb in the middle of the ceiling  --  and has another of her hourly chats with God . " He wants me to welcome a lady fish into my family and he tells me not to get personal . " <p> " A lady Jewish fish , " I point out . <p> " So okay , she wo n't be just a fish girl , she 'll be a gefilte fish girl , big deal . What do I feed her ? If I give her lox , will she accuse me of cooking her relatives ? " <p> " She eats fish all the time , Ma . " <p> " And when we leave the table to go watch Oprah , do I carry her or does she slither on her belly ? " <p> " Actually , she does n't watch Oprah , " I say . <p> " She does n't watch Oprah ? " she says , and I can tell this shocks her more than the fact that Melora is a mermaid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She 's never seen a television , " I say . " They do n't have them in her kingdom . " <p> " What are they , some kind of Communists ? " she demands . <p> " They do n't have any electricity , " I explain . <p> " You mean she does n't even have a food processor ? " <p> " That 's right , " I say . <p> " That poor girl ! " she says . " And no disposal unit in her sink ? " <p> " None , " I say , and I can see that suddenly she 's working up a head of sympathy . <p> " How can anybody live like that ? " she says . <p> " She manages just fine . " <p> " Nonsense ! " she says . " Nobody can live without a trash masher . My son 's wife may be a fish , but she is n't going to slave thirty hours a day just because I had to ! " <p> " That 's very thoughtful , Ma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do n't interrupt ! " she snaps . " You bring her by this afternoon . I 'll have some knishes ready , and some blintzes , and maybe a little chopped liver , and we 'll watch Oprah and I 'll show her my kitchen and ... " Suddenly she stops and re-thinks her schedule . " Bring her earlier and we can watch Donahue , too . And tonight they 're re-running that old series with Lloyd Bridges . It should make her feel right at home . " <p> " You 'll like her , Ma , " I promise . <p> " Like , shmike , " she says . " If I have to go through life without ever being able to point to my son the doctor , at least I can point to my almost-daughter the gefilte fish girl . Mrs. Noodleman down the block will be so jealous ! " She pauses . " We 'll have to put a little meat on her bones . " <p> " You have n't even seen her , " I say . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know your taste in women . Cheap and skinny . " <p> " Ma , you think any woman under two hundred pounds is skinny . " <p> " And you think any woman who does n't ask for ice cubes and a straw with her wine is sophisticated . " She gets up , and I can see she 's getting set for a couple of hours of serious puttering . " Now , you go get her and bring her back , while I prepare something for the poor undernourished thing to eat . And I think I 'll invite Rabbi Bernstein , since we need someone to work with her , and he 's always fishing when he should be at Temple , and ... " <p> As I leave , she is trying to remember which company sells the pens that write under water so she can send out wedding invitations to the bride 's family . <p> CARTOON : " I think it 's time you had that little talk with Billy " <p> <p> By Mike Resnick <p>       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
