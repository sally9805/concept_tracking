AMOST EVERYONE in the Americas and Western Europe will have a beautiful view of a total lunar eclipse on the night of September 26-27 . Skywatchers who felt left out by their poor view of last April 's lunar eclipse , seen well from North America only in the Northeast , will now finally get their chance . The Moon will be high in a dark , evening sky as viewed from most of the United States and Canada . Near the West Coast the first partial stage of the eclipse will already be under way when the Moon rises and the Sun sets on the 26th , but by late twilight even Westerners will have a fine view of the totally eclipsed lunar disk glowing dim and red low in the eastern sky . Only Alaska misses out . Moreover , this eclipse comes with a rare bonus . The planet Saturn will be shining at magnitude +0.5 just a couple of degrees from the Moon 's ruddy disk . Not since the " Spica eclipse " of April 12-13,1968 , has the eclipsed Moon been in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box at far right ) . Careful watchers will notice Saturn and the Moon changing position with respect to one another as the Moon moves eastward through the Earth 's shadow . Saturn 's position will also depend somewhat on your location . Seen from North America , the great ringed planet will be 2deg below or to the lower right of the Moon 's edge around mideclipse ( 2:54 Universal Time September 27th ) . As seen from England , the planet will then be 2 1/4deg to the left of the Moon 's edge . From Buenos Aires it will be 30 to the upper right . No other bright objects are nearby ; the Moon is in dim Pisces . WHAT TO LOOK FOR The map on the next page shows the visibility of the eclipse worldwide . The timetable on the facing page tells when the important eclipse events occur for four North American time zones . The diagram at left shows the path that the Moon takes through the Earth 's shadow , with its disk drawn in at times given in the table . Photograph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4th . Hans Buchholtz of Stenlose , Denmark , took these pictures with a 4-inch f/9 refractor on Kodachrome 64 film . Totality still had 15 minutes to go when he made the 20-second exposure at top . Totality had been over for 3 minutes during the 2-second exposure at bottom . Right : The Moon 's position in the Earth 's shadow at different stages of this month 's upcoming eclipse .

Adapted from the Fifty Year Canon of Lunar Eclipses : 1986-2035 by Fred Espenak. // The first event listed is the Moon 's entry into the penumbra , the pale fringe of the Earth 's shadow . The penumbra is where an astronaut standing on the Moon would see the edge of the Earth blocking part of the Sun . The outer portion of the penumbra is so pale that no change is visible until the Moon 's leading edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look for a very faint shading beginning to steal across the Moon 's celestial east side ( the lunar west side , the side with Oceanus Procellarum ) . Soon the penumbra becomes much darker and more obvious . The next event listed is when the edge of the Moon enters the umbra , the dark inner portion of the Earth 's shadow . This is the beginning of partial eclipse , also known as first contact . The umbra is much darker than the penumbra and fairly sharp-edged . At first the Moon 's limb may seem to vanish completely in the umbra , but as it goes in deeper you 'll notice it glowing dimly orange , red , or brown . The partial phase will last 1 hour 7 minutes , while the umbra consumes ever more of the Moon 's bright face . As the moonlight dims , stars will come out and Saturn will seem to shine more brightly . As the last edge of the Moon slips out of sunlight ( second contact ) , total eclipse begins . During totality at last April 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was a sign that the Earth 's stratosphere was relatively clear of dust particles . It was quite a change from the lunar eclipses of 1992 and 1993 , which were darkened to reddish black and reddish brown , respectively , following the huge 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines . Volcanic haze from the gigantic eruption spread throughout the Earth 's upper atmosphere , blocking much of the orange light of sunrises and sunsets that normally filters around the Earth 's rim to illuminate the Moon during eclipse . ( The Pinatubo haze also reddened twilights on Earth , hampered deep-sky observing , and was credited with causing a couple of years of slight global cooling . ) Now the haze is gone , so the eclipsed Moon should again be colorful and relatively bright . Look for different shades of darkness and color in the Earth 's shadow as revealed on the Moon 's face . During recent eclipses , time-lapse photography showed interesting wedge-shaped patterns slowly moving across the Moon . A scale for rating the overall darkness of lunar eclipses was devised by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the " Danjon number " form a long-running record of lunar eclipse brightnesses , so they are well worth continuing - in part to calibrate the atmospheric conditions responsible for how the eclipsed Moon looked before we had global atmospheric monitoring . Here are Danjon 's L ( for luminosity ) values : L = 0 : Very dark eclipse . Moon almost invisible , especially in midtotality . L = 1 : Dark eclipse , gray or brownish coloration ; details distinguishable only with difficulty . L = 2 : Deep red or rust-colored eclipse , with a very dark central part in the umbra and the outer rim of the umbra relatively bright . L = 3 : Brick-red eclipse , usually with a bright or yellow rim to the umbra . L = 4 : Very bright copper-red or orange eclipse , with a bluish , very bright umbral rim . A fractional estimate , such as 1.8 or 3.2 , may seem the most appropriate . Sky dc Telescope welcomes your observations , which can be sent to the address near the end of this article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instrument used if any , and a description of the sky clarity . Totality will last 1 hour 10 minutes , ending with third contact . Then the partial phases repeat in reverse order , with the last of the umbra finally slipping off the Moon 's celestial west-southwestern limb ( the Mare Crisium side ) at fourth contact . The penumbral shading should remain visible for perhaps a half hour longer . PHOTOGRAPHY The best advice for photographing a lunar eclipse is to take lots of pictures at many different exposures and throw most of them away . You never know just how bright your subject is going to be . But the table at right can serve as a rough guide . You 'll need a telescope or telephoto lens that enlarges the Moon to a good size . At this eclipse , the size of the Moon 's image on film will equal the focal length divided by 105 . Thus an 8inch f/10 telescope ( focal length 80 inches ) will produce a Moon image 0.76 inch ( 19 millimeters ) across , easily fitting onto the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans will have a fine view of the Moon being eclipsed on the evening of September 26th . Easterners will see the Moon highest and the eclipse happening latest in the evening . South Americans see the eclipsed Moon near the zenith later in the night . Viewed from Europe and West Africa , the Moon is in the western sky before or during dawn on the morning of the 27th . Adapted from the Fifty Year Canon of Lunar Eclipses : 1986-2035 by Fred Espenak. // The minimum focal length for getting a good-looking Moon is about 300 mm . A focal length as long as 500 mm will still give a field wide enough to include Saturn , the distinctive souvenir of this eclipse . With 500 mm and a 2-second exposure you could get away with a camera on a fixed tripod , but Saturn might not show well even on fast film . Longer exposures or focal lengths will require a tracking mount to prevent blurring due to the turning of the Earth . A simple , do-it-yourself tracking camera mount is described on page 32 of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , visual observers have measured the exact size of the Earth 's umbra by timing when its edge crosses lunar craters . Sky &; Telescope continues to collect and analyze crater timings to maintain continuity with these historical records . Results for the last few eclipses are described on page 101 . We invite all telescope users to participate in this fun and easy project . You 'll need a clock or watch that displays seconds . Set it just before your observing session to an accuracy of a second or so from a reliable source ( not local telephone-company time , which in some cities has been as much as a minute off ! ) A good source is the U.S. Naval Observatory time service at 1900-410-8463 or at http : //tycho.usno.navy. mil/cgi-bin/timer.pl . The photographic chart above identifies easily recognized craters and bright spots . When the umbra approaches one of them , note to the nearest 5 seconds when the umbra 's edge ( defined as the line where the shadow changes brightness most sharply ) crosses the feature 's center . Do n't be misled by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feature often remains visible when fully inside the umbra . The table above gives predicted Universal Times when features labeled on the photograph should enter and exit the umbra . If too many events happen at once , skip some rather than let yourself be rushed . In addition , try to judge the four contact times when the partial and total phases of the eclipse begin and end . Please send a copy of your timings , along with your name , location , the telescope aperture and power used , and any other relevant information , to Roger Sinnott at Sky &; Telescope , P.O. Box 9111 , Belmont , MA 02178 or by e-mail to rsinnott@skypub.com . FUTURE ECLIPSES The next eclipse of the Moon will be a spectacular , deep partial one that falls just short of totality on the evening of March 23 , 1997 . The Moon will be high in the sky as seen from most of the Americas . The next total lunar eclipse for North America does n't come until the night of January 20-21 , 2000 . So let 's hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crater timers . Labeled above are well- defined features for timing the passage of the umbra 's edge across the Moon 's face . The table at left above predicts when features will be covered and uncovered ( in chronological order ) , in Universal Time September 27th . South is up , so the umbra will first touch the disk at the right edge ( near Grimaldi ) . Many observers find crater timings easiest to do at medium magnification . You need an image scale large enough to show each feature clearly , but small enough not to blur the umbra 's hazy edge very much . // <p>
