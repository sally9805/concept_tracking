Section : Business The economy has stalled and a double-dip recession could be on the way <p> George Bush came down with a nasty case of the shakes last week when he  --  and millions of fearful Americans  --  were jolted by yet another round of alarming economic news . A disturbing Federal Reserve report shattered any illusions the president may have had about the economy 's underlying strength . The survey confirmed what government statistics have clearly indicated over the past few months : Manufacturing has slowed , retail sales are weak and bank lending has plummeted . Unemployment also continued to menace the economy as new claims for jobless benefits jumped to 452,000 , the highest weekly level since May . Orders for big-ticket durable goods such as appliances and machinery dropped for the second straight month . And sales of existing homes fell 4.3 percent in September , the third consecutive monthly decline . Even more ominous , the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp . predicted that additional bank failures could triple the amount of money needed to rescue the nation 's troubled financial institutions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be sliding into another downturn , the second leg of a dreaded double-dip recession . " The fourth quarter will be negative , ' predicts economist Gary Shilling . " It looks like Christmas sales are going to be a real disaster . ' And if their holidays are spoiled by more bad tidings , Americans are sure to blame President Bush . Last week 's Washington Post- ABC News Poll showed that only 37 percent of those questioned still approve of the president 's handling of the economy . In March , the figure was 49 percent . This eroding support could threaten Bush 's re-election next year , a frightening prospect for White House aides and the catalyst for last week 's scramble to come up with a plan for jump-starting the economy ( story on Page 60 ) . <p> The business community has also begun to worry as profits shrivel and staggering corporate losses pile up . Falling demand in an enervated economy triggered General Motors ' $1.1 billion deficit during the third quarter , for example , as uneasy customers waited on the sidelines to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plunge during the same period , because hard-pressed companies put off mainframe computer purchases . Feeble consumer spending , which fell 0.2 percent in August , was responsible for a 39 percent third-quarter earnings drop at Sears Roebuck 's retail group , and Nordstrom , the upscale emporium , expects to report flat profits and declining sales for the quarter ending October 31 . A 10 percent decrease in commodity prices over the past year has helped drive down Big Oil 's earnings . In the third quarter , for instance , Texaco 's net income fell 25 percent . And the devastating commercial real-estate slump , which has precipitated a dramatic fall-off in asset values across the nation , contributed mightily to Citicorp 's $885 million loss for the three months ended September 30 . <p> Many corporations would be in far worse financial shape if they had n't hacked away at payroll expenses and sentenced droves of workers to unemployment . So far , 1.7 million jobs have been lost during this recession , with layoffs permeating a wide range of industries  --  from banking to baking . Chase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employees last year , for example , posted a sharp turnaround as its third-quarter earnings climbed to $136 million following a $623 million loss during the same period in 1990 . Goodyear Tire &; Rubber Co. , which has seen its work force shrink by 1,100 people since last September , has also experienced a dramatic rebound . Profits at the company , based in Akron , Ohio , reached $59 million in the third quarter , just 12 months after a $61 million net loss was recorded . And on Wall Street , where nearly 50,000 jobs have been eliminated since 1987 , earnings are soaring . During the third quarter , for instance , Merrill Lynch saw its profits more than triple to $160 million from the same period a year earlier . <p> Slash and burn . A number of struggling firms hope to emulate this successful slash-and-burn strategy . AT &T,; a case in point , recently incurred a large restructuring charge from its takeover of NCR that will help fund severance packages for 14,000 employees over the next two years . The telecommunications giant hopes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third-quarter loss , will clear the way for a steady stream of future earnings . <p> Cutting back on capital expenditures  --  growing just 1.6 percent in 1991 , the smallest increase in five years  --  is another way that heavily burdened companies are scratching out profits in the slumping economy . Dallas-based AMR Corp. , the parent company of American Airlines , for example , managed to register a 7 percent earnings uptick in the third quarter , while many of its competitors remained mired in bankruptcy . But in order to maintain this scant edge , American has been forced to defer $500 million in new ground equipment , while delaying or canceling options on some $3.6 billion worth of new aircraft due for delivery in several years . <p> Massive layoffs and severe spending cuts enable companies to fatten the bottom line and provide shareholders with better investment returns . But if corporate America , in search of short-term earnings , continues to aggressively scale back its work force and pare down its outlays , the stalled economy could take a turn for the worse and a double-dip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth have already pushed real disposable per capita income down for four consecutive quarters  --  the first time this has happened since 1954 . Tapped-out consumers are also saddled with back-breaking debt loads , which now account for 97 percent of their dwindling disposable income . <p> Easing the crunch . In the face of these grim prospects , the Bush administration is desperately seeking ways to end the nation 's lingering credit crunch , another reason why the economy has withered over the past year . Since spring , commercial-loan activity has fallen at a 3.2 percent average annual rate each month . Bush has made minor regulatory changes to reduce the pressures caused by the lending squeeze , and Deputy Treasury Secretary John Robson says the government has " anecdotal " evidence that examiners are now going a little easier on banks that want to make new loans . But , he adds , the administration ca n't do much to correct the continuing contraction in bank lending . Citing " a sea change in bankers ' attitudes , ' Robson notes that many banks are publicly blaming regulators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the real reason they 're not lending is that they want to build their capital cushions or they 're fearful about the economy 's future . <p> Spreading bank woes have also cast a dark shadow across the nation 's financial system . Last week , the FDIC disclosed that bailing out failed banks will cost about $7 billion more in 1991 and 1992 than the agency projected just last summer . This will leave the FDIC 's Bank Insurance Fund with a $9.6 billion deficit by the end of next year . To replenish the fund , the Bush administration has proposed that the FDIC be allowed to borrow up to $70 billion through the Treasury . The loan would be repaid through sales of failed-bank assets and steep deposit-insurance premiums from banks . But as bank failures mount , it 's becoming increasingly clear that these measures probably wo n't cover the full bailout costs and , in a replay of the savings and loan fiasco , the American public will be stuck with much of the bill . Says Auburn University banking expert James Barth , " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to their wallets . ' <p> An expensive bank bailout is the last thing that debt-laden Washington needs right now . Throughout this recession , the government 's fiscal policy has been handcuffed by record budget deficits that have prevented it from further stimulating the moribund economy . As a result , the Federal Reserve Board , through its monetary policy , has been forced to combat the downturn on its own . Despite repeated interest-rate cuts , however , consistent economic growth remains on hold . This has led worried policy makers  --  in the White House and in Congress  --  to flaunt a host of alternative measures such as tax cuts . The sad irony is that the Fed 's ability to further loosen credit may be hampered because financial markets fear that tax cuts would increase the deficit and possibly kindle inflation . Once again , impulsive politicians , in a frantic effort to patch up the nation 's tattered economy , may have only torn this fabric asunder . <p> Picture : Third quarter $1.1 billion loss .
