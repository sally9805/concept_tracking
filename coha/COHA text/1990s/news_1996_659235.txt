<p> There once lived a girl who was rather ugly - or at least that 's what people told her . <p> She had pale , thin lips and a long , crooked nose . Over her right eye sat a blotchy , purple birthmark . Lynn Romer was her name , but kids called her Pinocchio and Wicked Witch . Grown-ups just stared . <p> For some reason , she was very shy . When strangers knocked , she hid in a closet . In high school , when other kids were dating , she stayed home . <p> Oh , she tried to look prettier . She dabbed on heavy makeup and grew her bangs long . She went to a doctor , who tried something new called laser surgery . It faded her birthmark some , but left a permanent scar . <p> In fairy tales , the ugly duckling grows into a lovely swan . But this was real life . The rather ugly girl became a rather ugly woman - or at least that 's what people told her . <p> One night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He pointed to a child and said , " He 's the beauty . " Then he said to Romer , " You 're the beast . " A carful of teen-age boys once pulled alongside her . One boy stuck a megaphone out the window . " WE SEE YOUR BIG NOSE ! " he said . <p> When she was 28 , Romer fell in love . He was a good man , a religious man , and she thought that they might marry . <p> Then he called it off . She asked if it had to do with her looks , and he answered that , well , he hated to say it , may God heal his illness , but yes - he could n't fall in love with an ugly woman . <p> Eight years later , Lynn Romer sits in a restaurant , talking faster than a reporter can write . No more hiding . No more makeup . No more trying to change herself into someone she is not . <p> She 'd rather change the world . <p> " I 'm ugly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ? I 'm ugly , and please do n't try to tell me I 'm not , because if you do , then I 'm going to think there 's something wrong with being ugly . It 's OK to be ugly . I think I have a beautiful soul , and that 's all that matters . " <p> From her Ogden home , Romer leads a very personal crusade against what she calls " looksism , " the judging of people 's character by their physical appearance . <p> Such discrimination is everywhere , Romer says , but she singles out a chief culprit - an entertainment industry fond of stereotypes equating beauty with virtue and ugliness with evil . <p> Romer has founded a group called The Pinocchio Plot , after the boy whose lies made his nose grow long . She has a new kind of fairy tale in mind . The wicked stepmother does n't have to have warts . Prince Charming might be short , fat and bald . <p> Such role models would show youngsters they can be worthy and capable even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Romer believes . <p> " The lessons we learn as children are the ones that stick with us the rest of our lives , " she says . " Those lessons are hard to undo . " <p> Some might say impossible . What Romer labels looksism , social researchers say is a fact of modern life . Studies have shown that attractive people get better jobs and are considered nicer , smarter and sexier than their plain counterparts . <p> Other studies go further , suggesting beauty is not so much cultural as biological , an evolutionary device ensuring that the fittest humans date , mate and procreate . <p> But Romer , hoping humanity has evolved to value more than just a person 's breeding potential , wants to move beyond stereotypes that magnify and condemn the physical flaws that sooner or later mark us all . <p> Even Snow White got wrinkles , she notes . <p> Bucking America 's obsession with beauty is a battle more easily joined than won , but Romer is undeterred . More philosophical than shrill , she tilts at her windmills with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faith in humanity , " she says . " I just constantly prod and nudge people along . You 've got to start somewhere . " <p> Actually , Lynn Romer starts everywhere . A lot of things bug her , and in conversation she darts from one to the next at a dizzying 200 words a minute . <p> Romer on weight discrimination : " People think that if a person is happy being fat , there 's something wrong with that person . But who is it the problem for ? Is it because people do n't like to look at fat people ? " <p> On sexy evening gowns : " When people get dressed for fancy occasions , women bare their breasts while men put on more clothes . " <p> On Disney movies : " They really punch my buttons , " Romer says , taking personal offense at " The Lion King , " in which the villainous Scar is named for a scar over his eye . <p> The Pinocchio Plotters number just a dozen or so , mostly women from Ogden and Salt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newsletter is planned , and the group sponsors a contest inviting authors to submit children 's books with positive portrayals of " appearance-impaired " characters . <p> Romer also writes hundreds of letters a year to newspapers , magazines and others . Last summer , she wrote to Leonard Horn , head of the Miss America Pageant , chastising him for calling it a scholarship contest while requiring women to strip down to swimsuits . He did n't write back . <p> Her complaints of looksism elicit groans of " Get a life " from those who fear that yet another politically correct " ism " will only create a new and unnecessary class of victims . <p> On the other hand , a letter of Romer 's published this spring in Mothering magazine drew more than 120 supportive responses . <p> " Thank you for expressing exactly what I 've been thinking for years , " wrote a mother worried about her two young daughters . " I 'm sick and tired of seeing their heroines big-eyed , big-busted , small-waisted and impossibly long , lean-legged ! " <p> Lynn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She is not grotesquely disfigured , not someone you 'd stare at on the street while hating yourself for staring . <p> In the right light , at the right angle , her faded birthmark and long nose are n't obvious . What you do notice are searching , blue eyes and a quick , confident smile . <p> For years , she did what many people do , measuring her own worth in the reactions of others . <p> The breakup with her boyfriend started her down a different road . It left her crying , angry and searching for answers . Are men really that shallow , she wondered ? Is the world really that cruel ? <p> A counselor helped . So did a plastic surgeon , though not in the way he intended . As he explained how he could trim Romer 's nose , she could n't help staring at the doctor 's own bulbous snout . <p> " He was totally secure with himself , " she recalls . " And I thought , ' What am I doing ? Why have I been brainwashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His looks really ugly , and he 's OK with it . I 'm certainly not going to pay him money to fix mine . ' " <p> Today , her anger and hurt have faded , supplanted by a determination to help others . She quit her job as a writer of closed-captions for TV programs and now lives mostly off savings , hoping to make a living as a writer . <p> Her curiosity remains . <p> She knows looksism is not a regional or class thing , having seen it in all walks of life and wherever she has lived - in rural Missouri growing up , in Southern California and Boston as an adult , in Utah since 1992 . <p> A male-female thing ? Ah , now that 's getting closer , Romer suspects . <p> She notices it at her drugstore , where 200 feet of aisle space is reserved for women 's beauty products , compared to 16 feet for men . She sees it in checkout-stand magazines with gorgeous models on the covers and headlines that proclaim , " Beautiful Skin Starts Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wrapping , Polishing , Snipping , Shaping and Buffing Your Body . " <p> The message to women , she says , is clear and constant : Whatever you look like , you 're not good enough . <p> To which she responds with a message of her own . It 's the moral of her story , one in which Lynn Romer - unwaxed and unsnipped - is determined to live happily ever after . <p> " Looks fade fast , " she says , " but character lasts .
