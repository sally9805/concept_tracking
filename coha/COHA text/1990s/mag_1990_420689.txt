How the spice people at McCormick cook up a successful recipe .. Focus on the core business , sell aggressively and add attractive new packaging . <p> MOST COMPANIES simply print their annual reports . McCormick &; Co. rolls a honey-like substance onto the pages , imparting a lasting , powerful aroma . After all , McCormick is the U.S. ' leading spice merchant . <p> The scent for last year 's annual report was cinnamon . Apple pie spice was the scent in 1988 . And this year ? That 's a closely guarded secret . But , says John Felton , vice president of corporate communications , " Heaven help us if we ever have a year that merits garlic . " <p> Relax , shareholders , this year certainly does n't merit garlic . Sales and profits are booming . The company founded 101 years ago when Willoughby McCormick concocted root beer and fruit syrups in his Baltimore basement will sell an estimated $1.3 billion worth of spice and other goods this year and earn about $65 million . <p> Yet , as recently as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the annual report ; certainly there was much to cause shareholders to hold their noses . McCormick had branched into real estate and marginally profitable lines such as its Tio Sancho Mexican foods and so-called portion packs  --  the individual packets given away by restaurants . Meanwhile , its dominant share of the retail spice business was slowly eroding . <p> Enter founder Willoughby 's great-nephew Charles P. McCormick Jr . ( Buzz to friends and employees ) . He took over as chief executive in 1987 . In just three years Buzz , 62 , has relit the company 's old fire . The payoff : By company estimates , its retail market share has recovered all lost ground and then some . At a recent 43% , it is more than double the market share of McCormick 's nearest competitor , Durkee French . Earnings per share rose from 52 cents in 1987 to $1.20 in 1989 and should hit $1.45 this year . <p> Buzz McCormick has cashed in on a growing preference among Americans for highly spiced food . Cajun blackened redfish and enchiladas verdes require a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make . As health-obsessed Americans curb their intake of salt and marbled steaks , they increasingly resort to garlic powder , red pepper and other spices to add flavor to otherwise bland dishes . Overall , U.S. per capita consumption of spices has almost tripled since 1965 to 3.1 pounds a year , according to the American Spice Trade Association . <p> Buzz McCormick took his first full-time job at 19 as a McCormick salesman , when his father was chief executive . Over the next 40 years , two non-family members succeeded his father in the top job while Buzz rose steadily through the ranks , specializing in the retail spice business . In 1987 he became chief executive , as part of a team with President Bailey Thomas , 59 , a 26-year veteran of the company 's unit that supplies spices to restaurants and packaged-food makers . <p> Thomas and McCormick are complementary personalities . Buzz , articulate and patrician , serves as the company strategist and spokesman . Bailey , an energetic , hands-on manager , likes to enliven sales meetings by appearing in costume ( for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Working as a team , they sold McCormick 's real estate and got rid of product lines earning less than satisfactory returns , including the Tio Sancho and portion-pack businesses . With cash from the sales , McCormick bought back stock  --  more than 20% of its outstanding shares in the last three years  --  accounting for much of the increase in per-share earnings . <p> To reverse the decline in the company 's share of the grocery store spice business , the Buzz and Bailey team spent over $20 million to redesign the retail line . The traditional white tins were replaced with modern-looking , clear plastic bottles that enable consumers to see what they are buying . <p> Under this team , McCormick broadened distribution . Since most supermarkets carry only one full line of spices , competition to get into a new store is fierce . Traditionally , spice peddlers have to pay the store in return for a one-to-three-year contract for the shelf space . This payment often takes the form of a special " discount " ranging from perhaps 2% to 25% of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As a measure of McCormick 's aggressiveness , the company 's " other assets , " mostly these prepaid discounts , more than tripled from $8 million at the end of 1988 to $29 million in 1989 . <p> Now Buzz and Bailey are focusing overseas . Many of McCormick 's clients-fast-food chains such as McDonald 's and Burger King , and many food processors  --  are expanding rapidly in Europe and Asia . Increasingly , they are asking their spice suppliers to come with them . <p> McCormick hopes to improve margins by pursuing new , low-cost sources for its spices . Since 53% of every McCormick sales dollar gets spent on raw materials , the possible savings are huge . <p> Bailey has already set up nine alliances and joint ventures with spice suppliers abroad . One is a large basil grower in Egypt . Egyptian basil is cheaper than American , but McCormick did n't buy it in the past , because growers could n't meet the company 's cleanliness and quality standards . In the new arrangement , McCormick contributes production know-how and training , in return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the company will save $2 a pound on several million pounds of basil a year . <p> McCormick and Thomas have been as adept in finance as in marketing and procurement . In December 1988 they sold McCormick 's real estate portfolio for some $500 million , earning a net gain of $83 million . " Some people are smart , some are lucky . These guys were both , " says John McMillin , Prudential-Bache 's food industry analyst . " They sold 1,000 acres of prime Baltimore real estate a year and a half ago . The timing was perfect . " Since then , vacancy rates have risen and prices have dropped . <p> McCormick and Thomas have treated their shareholders magnanimously . In addition to cash dividends , currently 12 cents a share per quarter , the company has been devoting part of its excess cash flow to buy back some 5% of its stock each year ; this , in effect , enhances the value behind each share still outstanding . <p> Given this record , Buzz McCormick has credibility when he says : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we 're doing . Our goal is to reach it by the early 1990s , and we 're halfway there already . There is even greater potential for growth in our international and industrial businesses . " Given the way eating trends are going and how McCormick has been cashing in , here 's a company almost guaranteed to grow much faster than the economy . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Founder Willoughby McCormick fits great-nephew relit the old fire . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Chief Executive Buzz McCormick ( left ) and President Bailey Thomas Cooking up a winning recipe for the country 's biggest spice seller . <p> By Dana Wechsler Linden <p> MEANWHILE , IN THE KITCHEN <p> Here 's one of Buzz McCormick 's favorite recipes , for old-fashioned herb dumplings : Sift 1 V2 cups flour with 2 tsps. baking powder and 2 tsps .
