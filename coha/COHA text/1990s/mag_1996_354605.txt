IN POLITICS , A SURE SIGN OF a serious candidacy is when the candidate finds himself at the bottom of a political pile-on . That 's how you can tell that Pat Buchanan is serious . Within a day after he unhinged the party establishment by winning the New Hampshire primary , his fellow Republicans started treating him as if he were a proposal to increase the capital-gains tax . On ABC 's PrimeTime Live , General Colin Powell said Buchanan gives out " messages of intolerance . " Sam Donaldson asked Powell whether he could vote for Buchanan for President if he were the Republican nominee . The general was crisp and clear : " No . " <P> In New York City , Republican Mayor Rudolph Giuliani called Buchanan 's primary victory " frightening " and raised the question of his attitude toward Jews . But it was Bob Dole who summed up the charge against Buchanan in a few words . The morning after New Hampshire , he said the G.O.P. primary race was now a contest between " the mainstream and the extreme . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian Coalition , Dole promised to tone down his attacks on Buchanan as an extremist . Since then , he has n't toned them down by much . <P> From the start , Buchanan has been expecting his primary-season opponents to gang up on him . But the scale and intensity of the not-so-friendly fire have been more than he counted on . " I have lost an enormous amount of respect for some of the leaders of our party , " complained his sister and campaign chairman Bay . Swinging through South Dakota , Buchanan warned his fellow Republicans to hold their tongues . " Calm down ; relax , " he pleaded . " Do n't say things you might regret later . " Earlier that day he delivered the same message on the Today show . " For heaven 's sake , stop the panicky name calling . " <P> Funny he should put it that way . One reason that Buchanan is so susceptible now to charges of extremism is that name calling has been his lifelong stock-in-trade . This is a man who can make Switzerland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four-letter word . Among TV talk-show conservatives , Buchanan emerged as the foremost belligerent power because when he talks , no niceties are observed . Race and immigration ? " If we had to take a million immigrants in , say , Zulus , next year , or Englishmen , and put them in Virginia , what group would be easier to assimilate ? " ( 1991 ) Women ? " Simply not endowed by nature with the same measures of single-minded ambition and the will to succeed . " ( 1983 ) Gays ? " Have declared war on nature . " ( 1983 ) <P> Likewise with his campaign stump speech , which has the devilish thrust that Dole 's so manifestly lacks . Not until you hear Buchanan go ballistic on immigration or trade can you fully grasp what the word " earshot " means . He has a different term for it : " going iambic , " marshaling his punch lines into warrior poetry . " They are honed , " he told TIME . " You work on it and you work on it and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
