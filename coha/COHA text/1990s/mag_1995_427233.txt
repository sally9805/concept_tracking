Section : Articles ; ARTICLES The Left is perceived as kind and caring , despite its extensive history of promoting genocide . <p> Mr. Watson , formerly a professor at New York University and now a Fellow of St. John 's College , Cambridge , is the author of Politics &; Literature in Modern Britain and The Idea of Liberalism ( St. Martin 's ) . He is currently completing a history of socialism . <p> WHEN it comes to handing out blame , it is widely assumed that the Right is wicked and the Left incompetent . Or rather , you sometimes begin to feel , any given policy must have been Right if it was wicked , Left if it was incompetent . <p> To give an example : I happened recently in Vienna to pass a restaurant that was advertising Jewish food , with two armed policemen standing outside . They were there , one of them explained to me , to guard against right-wing radical extremists . There had been no violence against the restaurant then , and I believe there has been none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wicked , so it must be right-wing . <p> That is fairly astounding , when you think about it . The truth is that in modern Europe , genocide has been exclusively a socialist idea , ever since Engels proclaimed it in Marx 's journal the Neue Rheinische Zeitung in January - February 1849 . Ever since then everyone who has advocated genocide has called himself a socialist , without exception . <p> The Left has a lot to hide . In the 1890s , for example , French socialists dissociated themselves from the Dreyfus affair , and in January 1898 the French Socialist Party issued a manifesto that called it a power struggle within the ruling classes , and warned the workers against taking sides in the matter . Dreyfus 's supporters were Jewish capitalists , they argued , eager to clear themselves of financial scandals . A few years later , in 1902 , H. G. Wells in Anticipations repeated the Marxist demand for genocide , but with variations , since the book is a blueprint for a socialist utopia that would be exclusively white . <p> A generation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his play On the Rocks ( 1933 ) , called on scientists to devise a painless way of killing large multitudes of people , especially the idle and the incurable , which is where Hitler 's program began six years later . In a letter to his fellow socialist Beatrice Webb ( February 6 , 1938 ) Shaw remarked of Hitler 's program to exterminate the Jews that we ought to tackle the Jewish question , ' which meant admitting the right of States to make eugenic experiments by weeding out any strains that they think undesirable . ' His only proviso was that it should be done humanely . <p> Ethnic cleansing was an essential part of the socialist program before Hitler had taken any action in the matter . The Left , for a century , was proud of its ruthlessness , and scornful of the delicacy of its opponents . You ca n't make an omelette , ' Beatrice Webb once told a visitor who had seen cattle cars full of starving people in the Soviet Union , without breaking eggs . ' <p> There is abundant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believed they were socialists and that anti-Nazi socialists often accepted that claim . In Mein Kampf ( 1926 ) Hitler accepted that National Socialism was a derivative of Marxism . The point was more bluntly made in private conversations . The whole of National Socialism is based on Marx , ' he told Hermann Rauschning . Rauschning later reported the remark in Hitler Speaks ( 1939 ) , but by that time the world was at war and too busy to pay much attention to it . Goebbels too thought himself a socialist . Five days before the German invasion of the Soviet Union , in June 1941 , he confided in his diary that real socialism ' would be established in that country after a Nazi victory , in place of Bolshevism and Czarism . <p> The evidence that Nazism was part of the socialist tradition continues to accumulate , even if it makes no headlines . In 1978 Otto Wagener 's Hitler : Memoirs of a Confidant appeared in its original German . Wagener was a lifelong Nazi who had died in 1971 . His recollections of Hitler 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camp , and they represent Hitler as an extreme socialist utopian , anti-Jewish because the Jew is not a socialist . ' Nor are Communists  --  basically they are not socialistic , since they create mere herds , as in the Soviet Union , without individual life . ' The real task , Hitler told Wagener , was to realize the socialist dream that mankind over the centuries had forgotten , to liberate labor , and to displace the rule of capital . That sounds like a program for the Left , and many parties called socialist have believed in less . <p> Hitler 's allegiance , even before such sources were known , was acknowledged by socialists outside Germany . Julian Huxley , for example , the pro-Soviet British biologist who later became director-general of UNESCO , accepted Hitler 's claim to be a socialist in the early 1930s , though without enthusiasm ( indeed , with marked embarrassment ) . <p> Hitler 's program demanded central economic planning , which was at the heart of the socialist cause ; and genocide , in the 1930s , was well known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no other . There was , and is , no conservative or liberal tradition of racial extermination . The Nazis , what is more , could call on socialist practice as well as socialist theory when they invaded the Soviet Union in 1941 and began their exterminatory program . That is documented by Rudolf Hoess in his memoir Kommandant in Auschwitz ( 1958 ) . Detailed reports of the Soviet camp system were circulated to Nazi camp commandants as a model to emulate and an example to follow . <p> Soviet exterminations under Lenin and Stalin may have totaled 25 to 30 million , which ( if the estimate is accepted ) would represent about three times the Nazi total of nine million . That seems to matter very little now . My Austrian policeman was still certain that racism is right-wing . As are a lot of people . After a recent bomb outrage against a synagogue in Lubeck , the German press instantly assumed , before anyone was charged with the crime , that the Right was to blame . The fact that there is no non-socialist tradition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That is an impressive act of suppression . The Left may have lost the political battle , almost everywhere in the world . But it does not seem to have lost the battle of ideas . In intellectual circles , at least , it is still believed that racism and the Left do not mix . <p> Why is this ? How has the evidence of socialist genocide , how has Hitler 's acknowledgment of his debt to Marx , been so efficiently suppressed ? <p> The answer , I suspect , lies in the nature of political commitment . Political knowledge is not like botany or physics , and commitment is not usually made by examining evidence . When socialism was fashionable I used to ask those who believed in it why they thought public ownership would favor the poor . What struck me about their responses was not just that they did not know but that they did not think they were under any obligation to know . But if they had really cared about poverty they would have demanded an answer before they signed up , and would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In other words , they were hardly interested in solving poverty . What really interested them was looking and sounding as if they did . <p> When Marxism was fashionable , similarly , I used to ask Marxists what book by Marx or Engels they had read all the way through , and watch them look shifty and change the subject . Or , for a change , I might ask them what they thought of Engels 's 1849 program of racial extermination , and watch them lose their temper . Politics , for lots of people , is not evidence-based . It is more like showing off a new dress or a new suit . <p> THERE are three motives , broadly speaking , for political commitment , of which the third is admirable . I shall leave it till last . <p> The first is self-definition . You call yourself Left or Right , that is , as a way of proclaiming to the world and to yourself that you are a certain sort of person  --  kind and caring if you are Left , competent and realistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ideas are far older than our century and matter now only to historians , and even they would usually prefer not to be asked about them . It might be worrying if anyone did . The line between the efficient and the inefficient , after all , is nothing like as simple as the line between the private and the public , and not all public enterprise is caring : Auschwitz was public enterprise . Never mind . If you want to look caring , you will not ask such questions , and if anybody does it is always possible to change the subject . <p> The second motive is a sense of community . You choose a political side because the people you know , or would like to know , are already there , and you would like them to like you . There was a time when , in university life , you would not be accepted unless you were Left , and it took enormous courage in that age to speak out on campus against Soviet or Chinese exterminations . That view is not yet dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atlantic who move , and intend to go on moving , in circles that think anti-Americanism a sufficient substitute for connected thought . <p> The third motive is instrumental . You can hold a political view with the admirable purpose of achieving something specific like constitutional change or a balanced budget , and support those who support it , whatever their party color . A moment 's reflection suggests that this is rare . It is hard work , for one thing . It seldom attracts admiration , for another , though it often should . And it is not always easy to believe that this will work . Much more agreeable , on the whole , to use politics as a way of defining yourself or of making and keeping friends . <p> The Left got away with its crimes , I suggest , because those who form opinion had their own reasons for looking in another direction . They wanted to see themselves in a certain light and to keep the good opinion of people whose friendship they valued . They had no wish to look at evidence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced , that it did not mean what it said . I remember once , in a controversy in a British journal , being told that Marx , Wells , and Shaw were being whimsical and nothing more when they committed socialists to mass-murder . Could n't I take a joke ? Evidence is seldom as inconvenient as that in the physical sciences , and scientists do not enjoy such convenient excuses for dismissal as whimsy or irony . Most critical theory , in our times , has been a way of pretending that evidence does not , and perhaps can not , be taken literally . <p> The effects of that mood are still visible . The history of socialism , above all , is studiously neglected and even , in some aspects , simply taboo . What we need now is a serious and unblinking study of socialism , of what it said and what it did : one that does not fudge the evidence : one that is brave enough to tell it as it was . <p> CARTOON <p> By GEORGE WATSON <p>     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
