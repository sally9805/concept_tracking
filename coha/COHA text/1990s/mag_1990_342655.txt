By actual count  --  well , actual approximate count  --  the Australian rock band INXS has played 2,000 performances during the past 13 years . And what have its members got to show for it ? Folks still have trouble with the name . " In excess " would be phonetically correct , but it lacks the cool mystery of those four uppercase letters , which make the lads loom large , like something mythic : six electrified Druids with some new rhythmic spells to weave . <P> The spells are catching , and holding . The previous INXS album sold 9 million copies worldwide . The band 's eighth and latest album , X , was released by Atlantic in September and promptly shot to the chart tops , where it has settled into the No. 19 position . The band is touring Europe at the moment , and will hit the U.S. , where it is a campus favorite , in January . <P> " Touring is second nature to us , kind of automatic , " explains Andrew Farriss , 30 , the keyboardist and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing in public , and our audience got bigger and bigger . Record companies in Australia had to sign us because our live-show following was bigger than some people 's record sales . " Adds Michael Hutchence , 30 , who handles lyrics , lead vocals and sex-symbol assignments with equal panache : " We 've toured a lot around the world for three or four years without a lot of success to tour on at first , because that 's one of the ways we show what we 're made of . I mean , we are one of the best live bands in the world . " <P> All that and anachronistic too . Proudly so . " We come from a weird generation , " Hutchence explains . " We were born on the cusp between the ' 70s and ' 80s , like U2 and Simple Minds . The whole live thing was very prominent in those days , before people made or broke their careers through video . We 're an anachronism . But a good one . We 're enjoying it . " <P> INXS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as performers rather than video icons , but their music is snazzy and right up to the second . It has good melodic hooks ( thanks to Farriss ) and strong rhythmic underpinnings ( courtesy of his brothers Tim , 31 , on rhythm guitar , and Jon , 28 , on drums , as well as bassist Garry Gary Beers , 28 ) . It has a surprisingly soulful flow ( from the sax of Kirk Pengilly , 29 , who also plays lead guitar ) and , in Hutchence 's dramatic vocals , anthemic ambitions . <P> The new album shows off their diversity extravagantly and exuberantly . On previous albums , Farriss and Hutchence tended to write a given song in one particular style , but on X they 've worked several styles into a single tune . The opening track , Suicide Blonde , starts off with a bluesy harmonica , then boots into a dance track that also rocks hard . By My Side has some suggestions of country , as well as overtones of a classic ' 40s-style saloon ballad . Says Farriss : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
