Three years in the making ! At a cost of $2.7 billion ! From three of the most powerful men in show biz ! Ladies and gents , DreamWorks SKG proudly presents : The Peacemaker ! <P> Actually , the film cost a thrifty $50 million ; the $2.7 billion is for the startup of the multimedia company that Steven Spielberg , Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen created in 1994 . But since DreamWorks has been on the pokey side delivering boffo product from its TV and music divisions , the release of The Peacemaker has sparked anxious anticipation . Should n't the studio 's first film , like the opening bars of a symphony , make a statement about the outfit 's ambitions ? <P> Not this one . The picture is an urgent if conventional thriller about the theft of a nuclear bomb by a Serbian terrorist . Every nation wants to defuse the bomb since the terrorist says he will use it to blow up the United Nations . But in Michael Schiffer 's script the task is pretty much left to a cowboy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clooney ) and nuclear scientist Julia Kelly ( Nicole Kidman ) . They race around the globe ( the film was shot in 10 countries ) , kill villains , crash cars and tap on computers . <P> Standard action-film stuff , including the **36;5690;TOOLONG scene from Spielberg 's The Lost World . It works well for a while , thanks to Mimi Leder 's bustling direction and to Clooney , who has a gift for eroticizing impatience . ( " Women ! " his stare says . " Ca n't live with ' em ; they ca n't live without me . " ) Then the film finds sympathy for its villain and goes softly nuts with him . In the final chase everyone 's IQ drops about 20 points . <P> The rest of The Peacemaker moves with familiar efficiency . It ai n't DreamWorst . It 's just an odd little film for the big guys to say hello with . <P>  --  By Richard Corliss
