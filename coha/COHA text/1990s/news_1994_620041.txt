<p> Welcome to Uzbekistan ! Stone-faced guards with guns are everywhere . VIP airport treatment means a one-hour wait for the return of your passport and another hour wait for transportation . There is no telephone book . Credit cards are useless . <p> Despite its poverty and obscurity , this hot , dry Central Asian backwater in the former Soviet Union this summer became the venue for  --  of all things  --  a multimillion-dollar international tennis tournament . Most residents of this predominantly Muslim country can not find medical care or even supplies to fix their bicycles . But the tournament was the pet project of Uzbekistan 's President Islam Karimov  --  and in this post- Soviet dictatorship , what Karimov wants , Karimov gets . Tennis , the president apparently believed , would put his country on the world economic map . <p> So some weeks ago a peculiar expedition descended on Uzbekistan 's capital city , Tashkent , following in the footsteps of Alexander the Great , Genghis Khan and Tamerlane , all of whose armies had seized this Great Silk Road oasis in times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small force of journalists and , most important , a division of cowboy capitalists and executives on the hunt for deals . But unlike the previous conquering armies , this expedition was invited by the government of Uzbekistan , all expenses paid . <p> While the tennis players brought the social cachet of their sport , the real mission was assigned to the executives , among them traders in oil , liquor , commodities , hotels and communications satellites . They were to open up this newly independent republic to capitalist investment , bringing Western technology and capital to a region filled with natural resources  --  to the benefit of both sides . The tournament provided a social setting where the business executives , most of whom were American , could meet government officials and local businessmen to explore investment possibilities . As in much of the former USSR , however , just who these Uzbek citizens were posed an interesting question . In Russia and other former Soviet republics , communism is mutating into mafia rule . In Uzbekistan , the No. 1 worry for foreign investors , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local mafia . <p> Tashkent is a dual city . The Russified sections include tree-shaded boulevards cooled by streams and massive fountains where brown-skinned Uzbek children sneak in to swim until they are rousted by police . The Uzbek sections are dry , with narrow dirt lanes fronted by mud walls and gates leading into family courtyards . Cows and sheep graze in vacant lots . <p> The bazaars are filled with gold-toothed old men hawking saffron and other spices . Brightly kerchiefed women offer apricots and cherries . Upside-down cow 's heads , ropy white intestines and fly-covered livers are all for sale , as are a pair of neatly aligned sheep legs , skin and hooves still attached . <p> This California-sized country is loaded with resources : Gold , oil , natural gas and cotton are plentiful . And its 22 million people have few consumer goods , so it 's a potentially lucrative market as well . <p> Lured by visions of profits like the silk traders of old , an international group of promoters from the United States , Israel and Russia formed the tennis-business brigade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moscow 's annual Kremlin Cup , a similar tennis-business venture that used Dan Bush , brother of former president George Bush , to help open doors . This time the promoters have brought along Ed Nixon , whose ski jump nose and awkwardly expansive gestures are disconcertingly reminiscent of his brother , the late president . <p> According to the promoters , Karimov committed $ 40 million of his country 's scarce currency reserves to the project , promising to construct world-class tennis facilities , and importing more than $ 1 million in gourmet food for the festivities . On the first day of play , welders and carpenters were still at work , and those who brushed up against a wall got paint on their clothing . <p> But things are not always as they seem in Tashkent , and hard facts are elusive . Even the President 's Cup business organizer , New Yorker Robert Coffin , told me , " It was n't really $ 40 million , it was actually $ 3 million . You and I will never know how that money got spent . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Rumors of corruption floated around the tournament : of bribes and rake-offs on everything from building materials to warm-up suits . The tournament director , an Israeli named Yuval Gat , said his bills were not paid by the government but by Sasson Khakshouri  --  a middle-aged man with silver hair and wild black eyebrows . Khakshouri , an Iranian carpet , construction and hotel tycoon with a Swiss passport , strong Israeli connections and a passion for tennis , appeared to be the tournament 's godfather . <p> But Khakshouri insisted that the government had paid for everything . When asked how much it had cost , however , Khakshouri became suddenly vague . " With the currency rates , it is not clear , " he said with a shrug of his shoulders and a smile . <p> The spanking-new stadium was packed with government officials on opening day . Ball boys and girls in smart uniforms paraded onto the center court , leading in the players with their national flags . Karimov 's bodyguards secured the stadium , and the president strode in flanked by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said he wished that people would not wage war by shooting one another with Kalashnikov rifles , but would instead compete " using sport instruments , " as the translator put it . <p> The president then took his seat in the stands as Ed Nixon was shepherded in to sit by him . While Nixon smiled and nodded , Karimov , with his narrow slits for eyes , pockmarked skin and cleft chin , looked every inch the steely dictator with some heavy human- rights baggage . In fact , the organization Human Rights Watch has issued a disturbing report on Uzbekistan that runs to 70 pages . Critics of his regime suddenly disappear . Not long ago , Karimov 's police arrested a woman for writing an unflattering poem about him . <p> But no protest marked the opening match ; players smoothly hit the yellow ball back and forth as knobby-kneed ball boys hunched by the nets . It was n't top tennis : World-class players were at the French Open that week . This was more like Triple-A ball with Wimbledon wannabes duking it out under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Californian Chuck Adams of Pacific Palisades . A curly-haired 23-year-old , Adams was suffering from a flu bug and coughing unhappily but managed to win his first match . <p> After the gala opening day , the shiny red and blue plastic seats at the stadium were mysteriously empty . No tickets were available for purchase , either , so the matches went forward with few spectators . <p> This upset Edward Nixon . He cornered Mrs. Khakshouri , wife of Sasson . " Government ministers have pocketed the tickets , " he scolded . " Where are all the school children ? The president told me the stands should be full ! " he stormed . <p> " But the government does n't want a public sale of the tickets , " she countered . " It will be better next year . " <p> " There wo n't be a next year at this rate , " retorted Nixon , storming off . He ostentatiously handed his ticket over to a young man in a wheelchair . " Let the people come ! " he declared with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a few drinks in him and is trying to change the system overnight , " observed his translator , an old State Department hand , trailing behind . <p> Robert Coffin gave interviews in the tournament 's bordello-like headquarters , where acres of pink carpet studded with burgundy velvet sofas were reflected in a mirrored ceiling . A dizzying profusion of brightly hued plastic flowers bloomed everywhere . <p> Coffin lounged on one of the sofas , the stub of a cigar in his hand . He wore tasseled loafers , no socks , white trousers , a blue and white checked shirt and dark aviator glasses . Coffin previously worked in the Bush administration . <p> " This country needs everything and I can bring people over here , " he said . " The business opportunity is incredible  --  there 's no competition and incredibly cheap labor . " He described the beautiful 17-year-old dancer at Tashkent 's premier hotel who works every night from 8 p.m. to 3 a.m. for $ 25 a month . ( The average wage in Uzbekistan is $ 10 a month paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) <p> Coffin has arranged a business symposium  --  a forum where the visiting American entrepreneurs can tell Uzbeks how to succeed in business . But the speakers are reaching across a cultural chasm : 1990s New Age aimed at the elite of a country where most people must stand in lines simply to buy bread . <p> At the symposium : <p> * A chic New York blonde explains how she " empowers " Manhattan residents with an information service : to get children into the right schools , find the easiest commute , develop " street smarts . " <p> * A tennis association official harks back to the " defining moment of U.S. tennis , when Billie Jean King played Bobby Riggs , " and urges Uzbeks not to stint on the training of their tennis pros . <p> * An author quotes Ezra Pound on " poets as the antennae of the race , " describes his difficulties making a living writing short stories , and recounts his success at writing for European Travel and Life magazine . <p> Solemnly seated on rows of red chairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uzbek audience listens impassively . <p> When the Uzbeks get their turn , the speakers cite numbing statistics : millions of cubic meters of natural gas , thousands of kilometers of railway lines and more thousands of kilometers of highways , 95 types of minerals in 700 locations , hectares of cotton production , the eighth largest gold reserves in the world . Their lengthy presentations end with pitches for investment , citing tax breaks , retention of profits and political stability . <p> For both sides , it is a very long morning . <p> The main event for the cowboy capitalists is n't the tournament , it is lunch at a luxurious dacha outside Tashkent . A particularly well-paved road leads to a walled compound , the home of Gafur Rahimov . A short , strong black-haired man who wore a peacock-blue blazer to the business symposium , Mr. Gafur ( that is how he is addressed ) has done very well since his country 's independence . He is reputed to own land and commodities in vast quantities . " The guy was a peasant three years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this poor , hot country , Mr. Gafur has that rarity , a cold swimming pool , as well as a fully equipped weight room , tennis court and a few television sets . He puts on a splendid lunch for his guests . His manners are those of a Mafia don . <p> From time to time , Mr. Gafur leaves the party and summons one person into a private meeting . Among those so honored : a liquor distiller , who already sells 20 million liters of vodka a year to former republics of the USSR , and a commodities speculator . Afterward , both men seem optimistic about the possibility of doing business in Uzbekistan . <p> The speculator , a towering Wall Streeter named Bruce Miller , is enthusiastic . " These people have raw product ; there 's a ton of cotton here , " he says . " And they have to find a way to get it to market . " Miller tosses around phrases like " tremendous spread , " " cost of the carry " and " commodity fluctuation "  --  concepts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Miller hopes to do in Uzbekistan what others are doing in neighboring Kazakhstan . " These guys go into Kazakhstan and they 're slamming down copper and other stuff . The spread is so huge , they 're moving from Brighton Beach to Greenwich in three years , " he says . ( Translated into San Francisco terms , the profits there are so vast that in three years people have made enough money to move from Sunset apartments to Atherton estates . ) <p> As the week goes by , other businessmen await an audience with Mr. Gafur ; some are favored , while others cool their heels . <p> When asked how he had put Mr. Gafur together with the Americans , Coffin becomes coy . " That 's what I do , " he says with a mysterious smile . " I find people . " <p> As the tournament nears its end , an Uzbek women 's softball team , the Asian Lilies , challenges an American team of government employees stationed in Tashkent and the visiting tennis organizers to a game . The teams meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spectacularly lithe Lily who is warming up in bikini briefs . Some of the Lilies have Asian faces , others European . <p> As it turns out , the Lilies should be called the Asian Sharks  --  they have been trained by Cuban diplomats to hit , field and throw . They slide into bases like grim rockets , and they outscore the Americans handily . <p> Conversation on the sidelines turns to the week 's tournament and the empty stands that had so infuriated Ed Nixon . Americans and Britons stationed in Tashkent are filling in the visitors about what 's really going on . <p> " Three planeloads of fancy food from Switzerland were flown in for the occasion , " explains a businessman . " Government ministers met those planes and claimed most of the cargo . You know why the stands are so empty ? The ministers have all the tickets and have n't given them out . But here 's why : With only a few people in the stands and invited to dine , only a small part of the food supply will last the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the black market . It 's in a warehouse now . " <p> Others confirm his story . " I ca n't wait for you all to be gone , " chimes in one woman who works at the American embassy . " I have n't had lobster in years . " <p> Perhaps , as the President 's Cup organizers hope , free enterprise will spread through Uzbekistan bringing with it a free flow of information , a higher standard of living and a more open society . <p> But there is another possibility , said a source close to the tournament who asked not to be named . Moscow , which is well ahead of Tashkent in economic development , has three McDonald 's outlets , and more Mercedes are sold there than in New York . But Moscow has become so dangerous that many foreign businessmen never leave their hotels , or else they arm themselves with knives or guns when they venture out . " It 's threatening , and you do n't know where the danger is coming from , " he said . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where you check your guns . <p> " Tashkent is safe now , " he said . " But prostitution is beginning here , maybe $ 75 a night ; in Moscow , it 's more like $ 200 to $ 300 . " <p> I asked if he thought Tashkent would end up like Moscow . " Probably , " he said . <p> Incidentally , Chuck Adams won the President 's Cup .
