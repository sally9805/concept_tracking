silence , darkness . woman sits alone in a chair at an institutional-style table , a harsh light hangs down directly overhead . a tape player , water carafe and cup , cigarettes , and an ashtray are close at hand . woman finishes a cigarette , stubs it out , and slowly begins to speak . WOMAN can i just speak ? ' s that okay ? i mean , i 'll talk about , buti got ' a sort of ease into it , you know ? ' cause i was never , like , this major talker or anything like to keep things to myself , some people 'd call it " private " or whatever , but it 's more like just being sort ' a " inward . " right ? i 'm an inward kind ' a personi think it depends a lot on the way you grow up , you know , family and all , and i just ended up more inward than anythinganyway , i found that a lot of times , when you ask for stuff , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always an answer out there , you can ask over and over , but you do n't all the time hear something back ( BEAT ) speaking ' a that , you can hear me , okay , right ? can ya ? i guess so she begins to speak , then stops , considers , finally , she begins again , very slowly.it 's interesting , you know , how things 'll work out . well , not " out , " i guess , not so much that as maybe just " through . " right ? things get worked throughor work themselves through , we probably do n't have all that much to do with it . we like to think we do , though , right ? god , like we 're in on all the big planetary decisions and shit , you know ? but , uh-uhyou wan na know what i feel , i think we 're just spinning around out here , completely out ' a whack and no way of ever getting it right again , i mean , back on track or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we been doing things wrong for so long now that it all starts to feel okay after a while , you know , like this is how it ought a be . ( BEAT ) there 's a greek word for that learned it in school , he taught it to mewell , i guess i more like " heard " it from him , if i 'd ' a learned it i could tell you what it is , right ? yeah . i know it 's greek , though , i caught that much , but i do n't remember what it was she thinks quietly for a moment.no 's too long ago now . had something to do with the world , the whole thing , coming off its axis or something , going off in the wrong direction from how it 's all supposed to be . and its the fault of people , or " mortals , " that 's what my teacher said , " mortals are to blame . " see , he said it was simply the fact that  --  and i never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good enough , that was the usual problemmbut he said it all stemmed from just our being mortal , right ? ( BEAT ) so , then every problem we got is from being mortals or humans , that 's what " mortals " meansand just because we are what we are , these " mortals , " it 's , like , our fault , explain me that she stops for a moment and lights a cigarette.you know , a lot of times i just could n't make clear what was coming out ' a his mouth , he was really smart , though , had , like , two college degrees or something , and still wanted to work at public school , i kind ' a admired that . i was in his class , one of ' em , his first year . ' s greathe took us , my class anyway , on a bunch ' a stuff , field trips , like museums , and up to chicago one time . that was fun . we went there , maybe twenty-five or so of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going along that one road , runs past the lake up there god , that was beautiful ! he looked back , my teacher did , sitting up by the driver , and saw all of us kids smashed up against our windows and staring out , every one of us with our eyes glued to that water ! so , he had the driver pull off at an exit and we got , maybe , fifteen minutes or so to run around on the beachthis was novemberchase each other , throw rocks , whatever , but all i did was stand there , stand down by the edge of the surf and watch the waves coming in. there in my little red windbreaker , and i du n no , i felt like an astronaut. or a kind ' a time explorer , maybe , some scout or something , sent on ahead , down to earth to see just what the fuck all the fuss 's aboutand taking it all in for the first time . you know ? i still remember that . ' s kind ' a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the monkeys and that one guy , he does those commercials forplanet of the apes , that 's the one . it 's like that , remember , when he rides down the beach and realizes that he 's home after all , and there 's no going back , and he 's screaming and everything , pounding his fist up at the sky , but he 's still sort ' a caught up in it all , too , like , taken in by the awesomeness of what he 's seem mean , it was better than that , i thought , maybe just because of my age at the time , it was better , but it reminded me of that a little , it did she stops , taking an extra long drag on her smoke.you know what 's funny ? he hit on me , my teacher did , on one of those trips , yeah . not on that one , this was at the maritime center a couple months laterscared the shit out ' a me ! i did n't even know what he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did , but i was , like , thirteen  --  and that 's just not what you 're expecting at that age . well , maybe it never is he came up behind me at the observation tank , right , where they 've got the sharks and everything , see , this other teacher was with us and she wanted to take the rest of the children on down the passageway  --  ' cause they have a place where you can handle different sea things , shells and crabs and stuff , and the shark tank has this dark room connected to it so that you can stand there and see without a glare all over the windows , and some kids were sort ' a scared  --  but i was always interested in sharks and all that , i was . you know , you have to pick a vocation in seventh grade , they make you do that in junior high , on this " career day , " right ? and i chose " marine biologist. " i did . out ' a all the other kinds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' cause i love the water , always haveso , my teacher said it 'd be okay if i stayed and watched , we 'd catch up later ( BEAT ) well , i 'm keeping my eye on this one big hammerhead , that 's a species of shark  --  you probably knew that  --  and he 's darting in real close to the glass , this hammerhead issuddenly , i feel all this weight up against me. my teacher is pushing me forward with his body , up onto the observation windows , and i ca n't move . he never said anything while it was happening , i mean , to me  --  i could hear him whispering something about the " tragic nobility of sea creatures , " some shit like that  --  and all i can see , i ca n't turn at all , the way he 's got me held there , all i can see is this shark , the one i 'd been watching , coming out of the murk and sweeping past me , again and againand it 's not ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned each time , that i can see his eye . he turns past the glass at the last second and his eye just sort ' a rolls back all white as he passes fuck , that was scary , i 've never forgotten it . that feeling , his weight on me , and watching as that hammerhead just kept circling around ( BEAT ) well , what the hell , it 's easy to scare a kid . right ? she plays a moment with the butt of her cigarette in the ashtray.anyway , he would n't look at me after that , my teacher , not even a glance , the whole rest of the trip . and he was always real nice before , and funny to mei mean , not in a bad way , not like inappropriately so , i do n't think , but  --  no , i was n't even a " teacher 's pet " or whatever  --  he was just sort ' a open with me. jokes , and showing me pictures in magazines , like , after that career thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing in pieces ' a coral to look atwe were starting to be friends , i thought , at least sort of friendly , because it 's hard , i think , for a teacher in school , like , junior high , where nobody cares , kids just wan na do sports , and dances , hang out with their friends , you knowso , if you meet a person who is actually interested , like i was , and i really was  --  i was n't the smartest or remembered the most , like i said , but  --  i was genuinely interested in things , i wanted to learn , right , i felt like i needed to comprehend a little about the universe , you know ? i did . ' cause it intrigues me. the way it works , yeah . ( BEAT ) and i think a teacher can pick up on that . and he just responded to itso , we started to sort ' a hang out a bit , just at school , the library , or looking at slides in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good , umm ' s good , that 's all . i mean , fuck , i was thirteen , okay , it was nice to have somebody look at you and not say to pick up your sockssomething like that . let 's face it , thirteen 's a pretty shitty age , right ? pause.but he would n't look over at me after that she stops a moment.he did give me a ride home , though , from school . he did do that . i mean , nothing , not a look on the outing , sits way away from me on the bus , but back at our building , see , he 's responsible for us , and all the parents are there , this is a friday , and my dad does n't show , he does n't show up . we go into the office , call his work , nothing at home , and he does n't come . half-hour goes by , nobody at school but us. sitting there on the curb , waiting for my dad . finally he says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . he drove this late model peugeot  --  i remember ' cause i once asked him to teach me how to say it  --  kind of a cream color peugeot , and he said he 'd run me home if i 'd like that . ' s what he said , " if you 'd like that . " ( BEAT ) in the car , like this was yesterday , i recall he had this woman singing on the tape player , real soft and painful , i remember , ' cause i had to ask who this was . i mean , this was not the bee gees and i 'd never heard anything like it . so fragile-sounding , you know ? he said it was " billie holiday , " that was her name , and it was all he ever played , first thing he 'd said to me , i mean , practically , in five hours is " billie holiday . " and he smiled , it was dark out , but i could see him smiling there , we 're sittingat a light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever listen to . " and then , " you kind of remind me of her , you know ? you always seem just a little bit sad . smiling , but sad . i like that " ( BEAT ) the fuck did that mean ? you know ? because , listen , you do n't say stuff like that to a thirteen-year-old , okay ? you just do n't , uh-uh , ' cause she 'll be yours for life . i mean it . if you do , she will be pause.not in front of my house , but down from it , a block maybe , he pulls over , there 's a florist shop and its closed , this time of the evening , and he parks in the little lot they have therehe kissed me. jesus , he kissed me like , i guess , you imagine how it must 've been when they first invented it , like back in the days of myths and shit , when , you know , men were heroes and you could get kissed like that and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would , and you could still taste him on your lips , years later , because back then kisses still meant something , that 's what he kissed me like she takes a sip of water . she fiddles again with the edge of the water cup but does n't drink.i really do n't wan na , umm , elaborate too much on , well , you know , cover all the relationship stuff a whole lot , ' cause if you 've talked to him you know it already , anyway , right ? maybe more than you want to ( BEAT ) we started seeing each other , you know , as much as a junior high school teacher and a thirteen-year-old can see each other , that 's what we began to do . we started doing that . and i know what you 're thinking , or have thought it to each other , laughing and stuff , that it 's my own fault or that he was some type ' a molester , whatever , but you would n't really be true about that . either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . and would kiss and things , not so much , but kiss and little hugs and stuff  --  i 'd sneak into his classroom at lunch for , like , just seconds sometimes , and we 'd hug  --  that ' what we 'd do . pause.my fourteenth birthday 's in march , i 'm a pisces " the fish . " how ' bout that ? i guess it was really the weekend of , the actual day fell on a thursday , but that saturday , he , umm , picked me up at the library , the downtown branch , where i did book sorting on a volunteer basis , ' cause you get a bunch of privileges and stuff if you do it twice a monthbut i told her , the volunteer coordinator , she was just a high school girl anyway , i told her i felt sick that day and he picked me up and we went driving , i asked where but he said , " it 's a surprise , " so i sat back in the o1 ' peugeot , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day out , and just kind ' a drifted off to the sound of the wind rushing by . the wind and billie holiday singing sad on the back speakers she stops , gathering her thoughts a moment.when we got to chicago , he drove straight to the lake , to this pier where he 'd rented a boat for us , beautiful red speedboat , and god , it was so exciting for me ! he just kept doing things like this , and there 's a picnic basket and it was great , just great to be out there , in the water , on this boat with him , it was just real lovely ( BEAT ) he gave me a bracelet , it was all wrapped up , in wax paper , inside my sandwich ! yeah , you believe that , he 'd hollowed out my bread and put my present inside there , and i loved that , that was just cuteand i got , ahh , this beautiful , like , picture book of several greek stories , mostly of euripides , ' cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what , " humanistic " had , like , the most humanity of the greek writers . he said he was the one most at war with this ( BEAT ) shit , still ca n't think of that word , but he was the guy who was really angry about the world being all fucked up just because we happened to be mortalsanyhow , it had a bunch ' a nice drawings and he said i 'd like it even more as i got older ( BEAT ) i still have it . silence.i , ummfound out about the baby , that i was going to have one , in late april , the 23rd , i guess , and i did n't cry . i should 've , fucking kid myself , you know , but sometimes you can go along , years even , and not feel like you 're growing up at all , and then there 's times when you age a ton , like , in a couple ' a seconds , you know ? so , i found out and went straight to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there and we discussed it all . talked a long time ( BEAT ) we talked , like i said , and , you know , he seemed , and this caught me , ' cause i did n't know what he 'd think , but he was all excited ! not yelling , or all adult and shit , and said he loved children , could think of nothing better than having a son or something , said we 'd have to be careful  --  i mean , we both understood the situation  --  but i promised him i would n't tell anybody who the father was , no matter if my dad got really shitty about it  --  and he did , believe me  --  or school , or whatever , i said i 'd keep our secretwe made a pledge together , there on his sofa , and i kept it . ( BEAT ) he told me that day , he said he had to go away for a couple weeks , just the end of summer , he was finishing up another of his degrees at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd , you know , make some plans . ( BEAT ) that was hard , ' cause i was scared , i 'm not gon na pretend i was n't , but getting his degree was a big thing , and could help us , too , he saidand so we talked for awhile , and we kissed , god , you know for being this big guy , he was really gentle to meand then i went home . i went to my house with our baby inside me , and watched hogan 's heroes on tv , like i did every afternoon . i mean , what else are you gon na do , right ? ( BEAT ) i just need a little water she pours a touch more into her cup and sips.okay. umm , what else ? ahhwhen i heard he 'd left his position at school  --  this was by a fluke , anyway , i was at the general office during the summer , which was not that far from our house , bringing them a vaccination report on my brother , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oh , i heard about your arts and sciences teacher at gardner , " my school , " we 're sure sorry to lose him , are n't we ? "  --  i did n't hear much else , really , just that she said , " well , i suppose they need good teachers in phoenix as much as they do anywhere " ( BEAT ) but i did n't ask for an address or anything , i did n't , because i was standing there , in that office , suddenly standing there , fourteen years old with a baby in me and this woman yacking on about my brother needing a german measles booster , and did i know if he 'd had one yet , and i was frozen in time . ' s like the heavens had opened above me , at that very second , and all i could hear was the universe , this woman in front of me talking on like i was her godchild and all i could make out was the howl of the cosmosand you know what ? it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly turned and it was laughing , laughing down at me she stops and slowly lights another cigarette.like i said , there 's a bunch ' a shit you do n't need to hear twice , and i do n't want your sympathy , okay , i do n't , so we 'll skip the hardship stuff about when i did tell my family , and being pulled out ' a school , the move to my aunt 's housesound familiar ? i told you before , or if i did n't , i meant tothis story 's nothing special , really , practically the only part that 's of any interest is that it happened to meyou know ? ( BEAT ) anyways , billie , that 's my son , billie , " william , " whatever was born . a beautiful boy . just quite great , and although every mom goes off on that , he was . i mean it . he 's great , and , umm , without getting all shitty about it , i give birth and a bunch ' a years pass . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sent a couple letters , and he wrote me back right away , this was , ohh , maybe a year , eighteen months laterjust long enough to make him wonder , you know ? i was still only about sixteen at the time , so i guess he was pretty scared about the whole thing  --  ' s what he said on paper , anyway  --  and asked if i could understand , not forgiveunderstand . ( BEAT ) i , ahh , let him know that our pact was still safe , and this was n't , like , some money thing , i just wanted him to have , if he would n't mind so much , a sort ' a relationship with billie , through the mail or whatever , i knew there was nothing for us , well , you know , not after thatbut i 'd send pictures and stuff , we ended up doing it through a postal box , and he got to know his son that way . that 's how it happened , a few presents now and again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother loved him , and kept the secret all while the father was away . and i know you 'll think i 'm just talking shit now , but honestly , if i closed my eyes and thought about it , i could still feel his kiss on my lips . even then long pause.the rest you knowon his fourteenth birthday , billie and me , we rented a car  --  we were living in utah by then , out with some relatives at that point  --  and we drove to arizona to meet his father , we 'd planned this , the two of us , by letter , and agreed it 'd be just the one timehe was , umm , you know , married by this time , married and teaching in phoenix , no children , though , is n't that funny ? no kids ' cause his wife had a part of her uterus , i guess , some thing , that would n't work properly , but they did n't adopt and just kept trying naturally , over and over . i thought that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , it 'd just be this once , at a motel that he 'd picked in town . one time when we 'd all sit down and see each other . again , at least , the two of us , again she fiddles with the edge of the tape player.this thing 's almost run out she looks up but there is no answer.okay . ( BEAT ) we met at the room . ' s a terribly hot day , at least for december it was , ' s how i remember it , anyway , and we were tired from the travel , but he was there , as promised , hardly seemed any older , which kind ' a sucked , i thought , ' cause i 'd changed  --  i mean , look at me , right ?  --  and it was this big moment for billie , ' s all excited , and we even hugged , and it was in that second , as he leaned in to kiss my cheek , his head turned toward me and maybe it was just the light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw something there , there in his eyeshe loved this boy , all that shit he 'd said to me years ago , it was true about kids . he loved ' em . but alsohe was satisfied , i could see that , satisfaction on his facebecause he 'd gotten away with it all . that 's what i saw , shining in his eyes , as he moved forward to kiss me. he 'd beaten fateand gotten away with it . ( BEAT ) after dinner , we had a bucket of store-bought chicken in the room , billie got a couple packages  --  one was a book of myths , imagine that  --  he said he wanted to see us again before we left . he had to run to school for about an hour , a science fair , i guess , but he 'd be back . he promised he 'd be right back . the last time i saw him , there at the door , he mentioned that word , thatumm , well , whatever , he said it and smiled , as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whispered , " maybe it 's not our fault after all . i mean , we 're just human , right ? " pause.billie was already in the bathroom , we 'd driven straight through , and i could hear the water running . he was in his bath . god , he loved the tub ! since he was tiny , he loved it . so , i knew he was in there , the water filling up around him , and " lady day "  --  ' s what he liked to call billie holiday , ' s her nickname , and he called her that  --  playing on his tape player . " stormy weather . " i , ahh , went into the room , the bathroom , and i could see him there , through a little opening in the liner he had pulled shut , eyes closed and the steam coming up . he did n't really struggle , could n't actually , the shock of it , i suppose , when the recorder first hit the waterthere was really only a quick kind ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or whatnot , and then the softer sound of him , billie , as he kicked a second or two in the water , i turned the taps off a little later ( BEAT ) after , i just sat there , on the linoleum , and watched him , lying in that cloudy pool of bath water , his eyes open and so still , i thought i could almost see , i mean , if i squinted , i could almost make out " adakia , " that 's the word . the word i was trying , you know , that 's it . " the world out of balance . " you can look it up if you wan na , but i 'm sure that 's the one knew it 'd come to me , if i waited long enough . she lights another smoke.i was picked up in vegas , at a restaurant , you 're aware of that , though , obviouslyand brought back here . and that 's it . so , now you know . i mean , what you really wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planned it , yes . butmaybe longer than you thought , huh ? lots longer she laughs to herself.and i worry about what 's gon na happen , i mean , to me and all , i do  --  ' s natural , though , right , to wonder about things  --  but i 'll tell you . tell you what gets me through today , the next hourit 's him . my teacher . pause. I can almost see ' em , you know , i can , down there in phoenix , probably wandering around on some playground at school , a saturday , and he 's just stumbling there by himself near the monkey bars . ca n't be consoled , right , the truth all spilled out now like it is , and all these tears running down , yelling up at the sky , these torrents of tears and screaming , the top of his lungs , calling up into the universe , " why ? ! why ? ! ! " over and over . ( BEAT ) but you know what ? in my fantasy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never is p. 3 she sits and smokes now as the tape player continues to quietly hum on . silence , darkness .
