It was October 30 , 1991 , and while the coffee room at the law office where I worked in Los Angeles was abuzz with talk about Anita Hill and Clarence Thomas , I was on the brink of my own personal battle with sexual harassment . I was in fact only hours away from being sexually attacked by Screen Actors Guild ( SAG ) franchised talent agent Wallace Kaye . In the months to follow I would join forces with the police and aid in a sting operation that would lead to Kaye 's arrest and conviction . During that time I would be lied to and betrayed by my union  --  SAG  --  the same one that had franchised Kaye . After securing two attorneys willing to represent me pro bono , the next stage of the battle would entail fighting SAG and forcing it to change policies that had protected Kaye for two years , while complaints from his victims poured into the SAG office . These complaints were filed away , and appeals to revoke his franchise ignored . But on this day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an appointment with an agent who was interested in representing me . While I was new to Los Angeles , I was not new to the business . I had been earning my living as an actor for many years and had worked steadily since receiving my master of fine arts in acting . After completing a tour with the Idaho Shakespeare Festival , I needed to establish a home base . I had friends in Los Angeles so I moved here knowing that with a rsum full of theater credits , rather than film and television credits , getting started in Hollywood would be like starting over . To be an actor in Los Angeles without an agent is to be without work . Agents receive casting information from producers , and without an agent you ca n't even be seen by the production companies that are hiring . One of SAG 's responsibilities is to regulate and franchise talent agents . To obtain a franchise , an agent must sign a 75-page contract ensuring " ethical behavior , " among other things . SAG retains full rights to invoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if any of the rules are broken . My search began with a list of SAG franchised agents . I then mailed my photo and rsuM to agents on the list . I had met with Kaye several times since June 1991 , when he first called me after seeing my photo and rsuM . He 'd seen me perform a monologue , and viewed a video of my work . Each time I met with him he was warm and friendly . The storefront office , which he shared with an associate , was impressively busy . The agency had one large room and a smaller storage room . Kaye was a mid-level agent , who had been operating only since 1990 . He had about 100 clients , none of whom were well known . He was often on the phone with casting directors , and usually there were other actors waiting to interview with him . On October 30 , he called and said that he had decided to sign me with his agency . All I needed to do was come to his office and sign the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office was empty . During the meeting I asked him what kinds of roles he planned to submit me for , and he asked me to do an improvisation to help him make that determination . He told me that there was a sensual quality about me , reminiscent of Ava Gardner . To determine if I could play that kind of character , he asked me to create an unscripted scene , or improv , that involved coming into a room and trying to " turn on a very cold man . " It did n't strike me as unusual that he was asking me to improv a scene for him . Since I could make up the lines , I chose to make the scene romantic rather than sexual , pretending to try to get my husband to take me out for an intimate dinner . I had barely begun when he stopped me and asked me to use him as my scene partner . I resumed and again he stopped me , saying he needed more . I asked him what he meant , and he said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I stopped . " I 'm not comfortable with what you 're asking me to do , " I told him . Kaye is a huge man  --  over six feet tall and more than 220 pounds . Rather than explain what he wanted me to do , he chose to use his tremendous strength to overpower me . Holding me down he thrust his tongue down my throat . While I struggled to get up , he put his hand up my sweater , undid my bra , fondled my breasts , and started to undo my jeans , saying , " Come on baby , let 's go in the back room and do it . " Finally , I managed to break free . Furious that he had turned a business meeting into an opportunity to molest me , I asked him if sleeping with him was part of his 10 percent commission . He just shrugged . I demanded to know what had made him think I would " go in the back room and do it " with him . He said there was " just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a SAG member and told him that I was going to report him to the union . He shrugged again and said , " So , I 'll just report you too . " When I went to the door , I discovered it had been locked the entire time . He followed me out , smiling and waving goodbye as I drove away . In a multibillion-dollar industry that thrives on sex , glamour , and money , abuses of power seem commonplace  --  so commonplace that there have been few attempts to challenge the status quo . If you do speak up , be prepared to lose work and be labeled a troublemaker . Like many female victims of a sexual attack , I tried to take responsibility for what had happened to me . What was it about me that made him molest me ? I analyzed the clothes I was wearing : loose-fitting jeans and a crewneck sweater . Though I knew what I was wearing had no bearing on the attack , I was glad my clothes could n't be construed as sexually alluring . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something on my resume to make him think I was naive or inexperienced ? No , I decided . This attack had nothing to do with my credits . I was a female . He was an unscrupulous male in a position of power . I was a victim . I choked on that word . I 'd always considered myself strong , intelligent , savvy . I 'd had other agents . I 'd been acting for 15 years . I 'd taught acting . I 'd instructed my students on how not to be exploited . Now I was the one who had been exploited . But " exploited " is hardly a strong enough word to describe what happened . A part of me was still struggling to comprehend it . Time had stopped . It all seemed surreal somehow . Feelings of disappointment , humiliation , disgust , and relief that I was n't raped slowly melted into an ugly mixture of rage and despair . Suddenly lines from a character I had played years before began to ring in my head : " To whom should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe me ? " The character , a victim of sexual harassment , was Isabella in Shakespeare 's Measure for Measure . I also felt duped . After all , the relationship between agent and actor is a business one , based on trust and mutual respect , but this man made me feel stupid and insignificant and used . What he did not only violated my body ; it violated my sense of self . My despair was soon eclipsed by another more powerful feeling  --  the desire for justice . Perhaps legally I was a victim , but I was a victim only if I did n't fight back . Silence was what gave the perpetrator power . And this attack was n't about sex . It was about power . Never for a moment did I ask myself i I would report Kaye to SAG . That was a foregone conclusion . Later , when I told my boyfriend what had happened , he advised me to go to the police . Funny , that had never occurred to me . They wo n't take this complaint seriously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was n't harmed physically . I could just picture it  --  an overworked police officer in Los Angeles County patiently taking my complaint , while the police radio crackled with reports of drive-by shootings , gang violence , and drug busts . Whoever heard of someone being arrested for sexual harassment ? I was to learn months later that what happened to me is termed " felony sexual battery " in California , a crime that can result in arrest . Though laws in the area of employment discrimination vary from state to state , if a supervisor pinches your rear end without your consent , he has committed the crime of " misdemeanor sexual battery " and can be arrested . Because Kaye touched private areas of my body , skin to skin , without my consent , he was charged with felony sexual battery . Unaware that I had a criminal complaint , I believed that my best course of action was to report Kaye to SAG . The day after my attack , I called the agency department of SAG 's national headquarters in Hollywood . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in writing . When I asked if there were other complaints filed against Kaye , I was told that agents ' files are confidential . This information gave me pause . What was the point of having a file if an actor could n't find out if there were complaints in that file ? I asked that question in my complaint , along with two pages of additional questions , and I gave a detailed description of my experience with Kaye . I sent a copy of the six-page letter to the state labor commissioner and to Barry Gordon , the president of SAG . I said that I would waive my right to anonymity . Several weeks later a high-ranking member of SAG 's agency department called , praising me for being the only person in 30 years willing to testify against someone in the industry accused of sexual harassment . She promised that , since I was n't concerned about anonymity , SAG would take action , but she cautioned that the situation had to be handled very delicately or Kaye could sue SAG for slander and libel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with this woman that would leave me increasingly puzzled . While I understood that many actors were afraid ( and justifiably so ) that naming an attacker would lead to reprisals , I could n't believe that I was the only one in 30 years who was willing to face her attacker . In early spring 1992 the woman from SAG 's agency department called to say that the union had confronted Kaye with my allegations . He vehemently denied them and said I had tried to seduce him . She assured me that the union believed me but said that the ball was now in Kaye 's court . He was threatening to sue SAG . I did n't hear from SAG again until June 1992 when a representative called to tell me that a detective from the Burbank Police Department was inquiring about Kaye . said that the union was n't involved with the police , but I could call Detective Dave Gabriel if I wanted to . I liked Dave from the moment we first talked . He told me he had a report from a woman who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished giving him my statement he told me that what had happened to me that night in Kaye 's office was felony sexual battery and false imprisonment . I was shocked . Why had n't someone at SAG advised me to report my attack to the police Dave was equally puzzled by the union 's inaction . He said the other woman was also upset with SAG and had reported her attack to the police only after having been told that her complaint would not be accepted because she was not a union member . Vicki Shapiro of SAG 's legal department told Dave that she had a file " thick " with complaints against Kaye , but that agency regulations prevented her from giving Dave access to that file , since the files of franchised agents are confidential . SAG had had my letter for seven months . During that time no one from the union advised me to go to the police , and Kaye had been allowed to continue assaulting women . I was obviously not the only one who had complained in writing or the only one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kaye . Little did I know at the time that Diane Figgins , the actor who originally contacted Dave , had called SAG prior to her appointment with Kaye to make sure he was legitimate . When she asked if there were any complaints against him , she was told that there were none . In fact , SAG had a file with complaints against Kaye  --  including mine  --  dating back to 1990 . They ranged from stealing clients ' money to physical and psychological abuse and sexual assault . Many of the complainants had agreed to testify against Kaye or to allow SAG to use their names . The police were trying to take the action SAG was afraid to take . But Dave cautioned that it would n't be easy : " Sex crimes like this are very difficult to prove , " he said , " because there are no witnesses other than the victim and the perpetrator . " But now Dave had my statement in addition to Diane 's . And he was questioning several other women . In early July 1992 , he called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women featured the same scenario as mine . In some cases Kaye had convinced the least experienced actors to disrobe so he could check their bodies for scars , and then he molested them . One young woman was so afraid that she would be raped and killed that she allowed him to stroke and suckle her breasts , while she cried and prayed to god to get her out alive . But it was still our word against Kaye 's and Gabriel was so worried about other women being molested , he wanted to act quickly . He was forming a plan . " I 'm thinking of putting together a sting operation , " he told me . " Do you think if I put an undercover officer on the case posing as an actress that Kaye will fall for it ? " When I said that he definitely would , Dave asked me if I 'd coach Susan Hayn , the undercover officer . Susan dropped by Kaye 's office about nine one morning with her photo and a resume I had written for her . Kaye was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepare a monologue and call him the following week . He offered her coffee and tried to hug her as she left his office . With the first contact made , it was time for Susan and me to prepare . Susan and her sergeant came to my home one afternoon . The sergeant was very concerned about the kind of door Kaye 's office had . He said the police officers might have to break it down if Susan , who would be wearing a wire , signaled them that she was in danger . As an undercover officer posing as a prostitute , Susan had never had to be touched to get the criminal . This time she would have to let him touch the most intimate parts of her body . I told Susan that the most important thing about the next meeting was that she seem naive , enthusiastic , and gullible . I selected a short monologue for her to memorize , reminding her that Kaye was n't judging her talent . What he wanted was her body . A few days later , Dave called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wife was there . He had Susan do her monologue quickly and then dismissed her . We were back to square one . It was now September . Kaye and Susan were having trouble making contact because Susan was so hard to reach . Dave was afraid that Kaye might suspect what was happening . But I did n't believe that Kaye suspected Susan was an undercover officer . All of his actions with Susan thus far were consistent with his " normal " pattern of behavior . On September 17 , Susan finally reached Kaye by phone . Kaye made an early evening appointment with her for that week . Susan and I met one more time to prepare her for what we hoped would be the last time that Kaye sexually molested a woman . Susan admitted that she was nervous because " so many women are counting on me . I do n't want to let them down . " A few days later , a jubilant Dave called me . The sting operation had been a success . True to form , Kaye had put Susan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all on tape . While Susan did n't regret having taken part in the operation , Dave said she was pretty shaken up by the whole experience . " When I realized that even with all my police training he could easily overpower me , I got scared , " she later said . While Susan was in the office with Kaye , her sergeant and fellow officers were waiting in a car , listening to what was happening to her via the wire . There were also several other police cars outside the building . The officers heard the tension in her voice and were ready to break in when Susan emerged from Kaye 's office and ran for her car . Her sergeant would later say it was " hell " listening to what she was going through in there . Kaye was arrested at his office on October 7 , 1992 . He met bail and was released only to be rearrested after other victims came forward . More than 50 women called Dave , prompting the court to assign Kaye 's bail at half a million dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid a visit to SAG 's agency department . When I asked if what had happened to me was a crime , the same woman I 'd talked to months earlier said she did n't know . I asked her why SAG had n't reported Kaye to the police , and she told me that the agents ' contract is a " gentleman 's agreement " and " we just do n't know what to do when they do n't act like gentlemen . " When I volunteered to help draft a pamphlet for SAG members on sexual harassment , she walked me to the door and said , " Maybe one day you will be on the board of directors and then you can tell me how to do my job . " Kaye was tried in April 1993 . He was convicted on nine counts of sexual battery and false imprisonment . I attended his sentencing on June 9 , 1993 . In spite of the probation officer recommending probation because all the victims " talk as if they had lived a totally cloistered life and had never had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentenced Kaye to five years and four months in prison . I immediately went to Los Angeles attorneys Wayne W. Smith and Leanne Fisher of Gibson , Dunn and Crutcher , one of the largest corporate law firms in California . After hearing the facts , they offered to represent me pro bono in my attempt to force SAG to change its policies on the confidentiality of agents ' files . This experience has taught me how much good can be accomplished if you choose action over fear . Sexual harassment and sexual assault do n't have to be " business as usual " in the entertainment industry . As or me , I have a new manager who introduced me to a reputable agent . I have yet to experience any reprisal for my actions , but if I do , so be it . Who ever said doing what 's right is easy ? THE UNION Wallace Kaye has been in prison almost a year , but questions are still swirling around his little storefront operation . Kaye may be the first Hollywood talent agent to be imprisoned for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clients . He was franchised by the Screen Actors Guild ( SAG ) , a union that failed to protect its actors from an abusive agent . A lawsuit filed by Gloria Allred , the lawyer who 's representing one of the women Kaye sexually assaulted , has put SAG on the defensive . Allred and her client , Diane Figgins , have accused SAG of negligent misrepresentation for claiming that there were no complaints against Kaye , despite having received complaints of sexual assault and harassment against him . SAG 's director of communications , Mark Locher , was widely quoted as saying that SAG 's hands were tied because none of the complainants were willing to come forward . Though no one at SAG would return calls from Ms. about Kaye , SAG spokesman Harry Medved and actor Lisa Pelikan , who is the vice chair of SAG 's women 's committee , agreed to speak with us about sexual harassment in general . Asserting that they were " not lawyers , " they did not want to comment on the Kaye case except to say that until a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing could be done to discipline Kaye . Pelikan said the union " moved forward immediately " when such a person materialized . She then went so far as to take credit for apprehending Kaye : " To say that we did n't do anything is just bullshit , " she said . " SAG set up the sting operation . The whole reason it was done was because of SAG . " Deputy District Attorney Mark Collier , who prosecuted the Kaye case , laughed long and hard when told of Pelikan 's claim . " I do n't think they were very instrumental , " he said , understating the case . In fact , both the SAG file on Kaye and statements from women who complained to SAG about Kaye show that SAG 's claims are indeed laughable . The file contains singed complaints from SAG members that date from before police contacted SAG about performing the sting operation that led to Kaye 's arrest . " Of course I was willing to come forward , " said SAG member Leslie La Page , whose formal complaint was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claim there was no SAG members willing to come forward is an unfortunate misunderstanding , an out-and-out lie , or a memory lapse , " La Page scoffed , adding that the person she spoke to at SAG told her there had already been 200 complaints filed on Kaye . For Allred , the claim that SAG could n't pursue allegations from nonmembers is itself suspect : " Does that mean that a SAG-franchised agent is permitted to sexually harass an actress as long as the actress is not a SAG member ? " As for SAG 's fear of committing slander , Allred said the truth itself constitutes defense against defamation . Those involved in the Kaye sting claim SAG  --  far from aiding in the sting  --  actually refused even to cooperate . SAG would not hand over the Kaye file for fear of violating the anonymity of those who had complained , though it certainly could have released names of those who freely gave them . What SAG did do , as the file reveals , is take note of Kaye 's offenses . One SAG employee describes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about an agent . The caller refused to name the agent , but the description sounded a lot like Kaye . Beginning June 28 , 1990  --  two days after the date of the first signed complaint against Kaye from a SAG member  --  memos started appearing regarding the " Wallace Kay file . " Reports of sexual , physical , psychological , and financial abuse piled up . The mother of a child actor reported that Kaye threw a chair at her when she refused to sign a contract . A male client reported that Kaye purloined an airline ticket meant for the actor 's girlfriend . A caller reported having witnessed Kaye " psychologically abuse " two women actors . Another reported that he " slapped , pinched and scratched " her face . Can sexual barter be rooted out of Hollywood 's entertainment industry ? At press time , SAG has rebuffed attempts by Charmaine Blakely 's lawyers to add sexual harassment as cause for dismissing a franchised agent . In a telling example of how little has changed in Hollywood , SAG 's Lisa Pelikan has presented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with sexual harassment . Her advice ? Inform SAG of any improper conduct . Though SAG did nothing to discipline Wallace Kaye , Pelikan now claims that no sexual harasser will ever eat lunch in Hollywood again . Exactly how would SAG eliminate harassers ? By pulling their contracts . Groping unsuccessfully for an example , Pelikan alighted on this bit of circular logic : " We pulled Wallace Kaye 's contract . He 's no longer a franchised agent . " Unless he 's operating from prison . THE UNDERCOVER COP She 's five foot four , but " I 'm not a wimpy little girl , " says Susan Hayn , the 30-year-old cop who took part in the sting operation that snared talent agent Wallace Kaye in the act of sexual assault . " I work out . I 'm not naive . " Even so , her confrontation with the 220-pound Kaye was not one she would want to repeat : " Letting this guy touch you when you do n't want him to touch you  --  that was more difficult than any job I 've done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her yearly crackdowns on johns that could have prepared her for the risks she took as the naif in Kaye 's office . As a faux prostitute , Hayn carried a gun . With the johns , Hayn says , " there 's no physical confrontation . " In Kaye 's office Hayn would be armed with only a microphone . Her six backup officers in one squad car and two unmarked cars would be out of eyeshot  --  a crowbar and battering ram away from the other side of Kaye 's locked office door . And despite everything Hayn had heard , she still was n't prepared for Kayes ' hulking , overpowering presence . But she was n't surprised by the first thing Kaye did when she walked in his office  --  he locked the door . Kaye 's elaborate sexual come-on bordered on the absurd as he whipped out a lingerie catalog and asked Hayn to strip . " I rebuffed him on the bra-and-panties routine , " Hayn says . Kaye then decided to lure her into an improv . The first was his signature setup : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be more " sensuous . " After several false starts , he prompted her to move closer and closer . When she repeatedly balked , he became increasingly annoyed . Undaunted , he tried other scenarios . As the scenarios became more and more provocative , Kaye became more excited and aggressive . " I could n't hold his hands , " Hayn recalls . They quickly slid up her dress and over her breasts and rear . As he nudged her dress open with his chin , Hayn used all her strength to try and keep him away , but he still overpowered her  --  something that had never happened to Hayn in eight years as a cop . Hayn returns again to the fine line between attempting to preserve her own sense of wholeness and apprehending the criminal . Hayn knew she 'd reached her limit when Kaye 's fingers worked their way up to her crotch : " I said , " Mr. Kaye ! " and he got a little worried . " Hayn never called for backup . When she fled from Kaye 's office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not arrested on the spot . Instead , he was allowed to incriminate himself even further by denying  --  to a uniformed officer who waited outside  --  that he even saw a distraught woman running from his office . As to whether it was worth actually being molested in order to trap the molester , Hayn responds with a resolute " yes . " THE DETECTIVE Right after Wallace Kaye 's fateful encounter with undercover officer Susan Hayn , a uniformed member of the sting team stopped Kaye in the alley behind his office . Claiming to be working the " alley burglary suppression team "  --  a complete fabrication  --  the officer told Kaye that a " blonde-haired gal " had bolted out of the building saying she 'd been attacked in his office . Kaye denied ever having spoken to the woman , and the officer responded with a dutiful , " Oh , O.K. She looked distraught , but that 's O.K. " The officer 's phony reply may sound unnervingly similar to how male cops have often handled complaints by women who have been sexually assaulted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stereotypes . Some cops do take sexual assaults seriously , and some  --  like Detective ( now Sergeant ) Dave Gabriel  --  find them so repugnant they work overtime to apprehend the attackers . Gabriel was helped by a host of fortuitous circumstances , including a cooperative district attorney 's office , the availability of officers who share his outrage , and the willingness of sexually abused women to come forward and tell their stories . Gabriel got the case when actor Diane Figgins called him with a complaint that on its own would probably have been rejected as too iffy to try in court . But Gabriel never doubted Figgins ' story , and after discovering that dozens of women had filed similar complaints with SAG , he decided to approach Susan Hayn about doing a sting operation . " I did n't want to delay too much longer because women were going in there and could be assaulted , " Gabriel recalls . " I did n't want to rush in with too little evidence , but if any women had reported rapes it would have been morally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Hayn , and a half dozen officers had worked out a series of cues . If Kaye got out of control , Hayn would say , " Uncle Don wo n't like this . " ( Don was her sergeant . ) Gabriel told Hayn , " We 'll crash down the door . We 'll be crashing through the windows so stay out of the way of flying glass . Hold him off for ten seconds , that 's how long it 'll take us to be in there . " In fact , the sergeant did call officers to Kaye 's door as Hayn and Kaye played a cat-and-mouse game in which Hayn , her voice tense , told Kaye to stop . " That door was about to come down , " says officer Javier Ruiz . But then Hayn flew through it , so agitated she did n't even see her fellow officers waiting outside . There were some glitches . That morning one of the officers suggested that Kaye might ask Hayn to strip . Gabriel pooh-poohed the idea . " Sure enough , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , " Come out in your bra and panties . I want to see what I 'm representing . ' ' " Hayn refused to strip . Hayn 's experience made lasting impressions on most of the officers involved . Gabriel confesses that he 's not as elated as he once was about the operation . " I did not intend for her to be assaulted that much , " he now says . While Gabriel concedes that some cops lack sensitivity , he interprets their " robotic distance " as a shield against the kind of burnout he himself suffered before leaving the sex crimes unit last year : " I tell my officers they have to steel themselves against something like a six-year-old girl who 's been sodomized so badly her intestines are ripped apart . Tell me you 're not gon na be affected by that . " Charmaine Blakely has just completed a run in the play " You Ca n't Take It with You " at the Colony Studio Theater in Los Angeles . Blakely and Figgins , along with their lawyers , continue to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeking monetary damages against SAG , Blakely says , " I 'm not interested in money . I 'm interested in change . " Wallace Kaye is still in prison , though he and his wife , Elizabeth , maintain his innocence . Dave Gabriel has been promoted to sergeant . <p>
