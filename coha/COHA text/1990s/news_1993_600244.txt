<p> Imagine a classroom of kids with no teacher . Or an army going into battle with no general . It could be chaotic , right ? That 's the story of the stock market lately - little or no leadership . It 's a key reason why many investors , both pros and casual investors , are fearful . The agony of it all : perhaps an onslaught of lower stock prices . <p> Will Weinstein , head of San Francisco 's Genesis Merchant Group , a $ 1 billion money manager , sums it up : " It 's risky as hell with no leadership and no clue to the next darling . So we 're cutting back on stocks . I 'd rather be safe than dead . " <p> Weinstein , citing the current leadership of gold , oil and utilities , says , " That 's negative leadership . It 's defensive . it means most investors sense a down market . " <p> Elaine Hahn , skipper of San Francisco 's Hahn Capital Management ( assets : $ 30 million ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a theme that is n't rotated on a weekly basis . " But the problem is that there 's no emerging leader . " <p> Clearly there 's a shift among many big guns from big-name growth companies to defensive issues . How long it 'll last is anybody 's guess . But one old friend , market veteran Larry Wachtel of Prudential Securities , sees it picking up steam . <p> " The game now is to be more risk averse , " he says . " We 're moving from 20 price-earnings multiples to 10 . That 's easy to understand . No one wants his head handed to him like we saw in Philip Morris and Policy Management Systems . " <p> On bum earnings news , both stocks - in just one day - tumbled 23% and 43% , respectively . <p> What about all the talk of a swing to economic-sensitive companies ? Granted , there are many boosters out there . But it 's rated a dead game if the economy goes south . <p> It all raises a critical question : How do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I put that question to a trio of pros . Each is beating the market 50 million partnership in Atlanta . Their best ideas , plus 12-month targets , are in the chart . <p> All three are wary of the market . Patterson is the chief grizzly . " We 're making a market top , " he says . " It 'll be extremely difficult to make money the rest of ' 93 . " <p> Why ? He thinks interest rates have bottomed and will rise slowly in an improving economy . Likewise , he has inflation worries - namely that President Clinton 's policies will hike the costs of doing business , and those costs will be passed to consumers . <p> He figures the over-the-counter market already has made a top and the Standard &; Poor 's 500 index is in the process of doing the same . He sees the NASDAQ composite down 20% to 25% <p> So how is he playing the market ? " Since there ai n't much leadership , you 've got to go with earnings momentum wherever you find it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chart , Motorola is No. 1 . " Communications is the big growth area of the ' 90s , and Motorola is the lead dog . " His earnings numbers : $ 3.10 a share this year and $ 4 in ' 94 . Last year 's net : $ 2.17 . <p> Given his worries , he has shifted his portfolio to 50% long and 50% short , a bet on lower prices . He also has slashed his technology holdings from 45% of his portfolio to 20% since he sees a big slowdown in earnings momentum later this year . It 's based on his belief that supply will catch up with big demand in personal computers . He figures that 'll mean a peak in profit margins . <p> " Almost all high-tech firms are involved with the black box ( computer ) , and many will suffer , " he says . He 's especially wary of Broderbund Software , Arrow Electronics , Cabletron Systems and Adaptec . <p> What about consumer biggies that have been getting bashed ? He sees more bashing . " When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we are now , P-E multiples are at their highest level , " he says . " And since rates will go up , multiples will come down . " <p> From current levels , he sees 20% to 25% drops in 12 to 18 months in the likes of General Mills , Duracell , Rubbermaid , Home Depot , Wal-Mart , Coca-Cola and PepsiCo . He sees the same for RJR Nabisco , which he labels " a poor man 's Philip Morris that 's overloaded with debt . " <p> Given big uncertainty surrounding health-care reform , the last place you might expect leadership is health care . Not so , says Weinstein . " Action in some sectors has already discounted the dangers and unknowns , " he says . He says this is especially so in hospital management , particularly in the psychiatric arena - an area that has Clinton support . <p> His top pick : Community Psychiatric Centers , which has 56 such facilities . " It 's reinventing itself , " he says . " It 's got a fortress balance sheet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the quality of its health care . " He sees earnings of 40 cents a share in the fiscal year that ends Nov. 30 , down from 52 cents in ' 92 . But then he sees a dramatic pickup to more than $ 1.20 a share in ' 94 and $ 2 in ' 95 . " It 's a $ 30 stock in two years , " he says . Thursday 's close : $ 11 1/8 . <p> A lot of energy-related companies are showing plenty of energy this year , with many up over 20% . Some pros , though , see it as little more than a trading phenomenon . Not Hahn . She sees selected names taking on a solid leadership role . " There 's a structural change in the supply-demand pattern , " she says . " Demand is no longer seasonable but sustainable . Oversupply is over within such key fuels as oil and gas . " <p> Her top pick is Thermo Process . It has a process that eliminates hydrocarbons from contaminated dirt . Customers include army bases and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 75% owned by Thermo Electron . What excites Hahn , she tells me , is a superior technology no one has been able to replicate . Her earnings numbers : 60 cents a share in the Aug. 31 fiscal year , $ 1 to $ 1.25 next year . Last year 's net : 30 cents . <p> Her market outlook : lower prices by year 's end . She sees second-half economic growth , contrary to expectations , slower than the first half because tax increases will eat away at consumer spending . Her woeful wrapup : " We 're at the brink of a significant downward revaluation of stock values . I 'd only buy with great care .
