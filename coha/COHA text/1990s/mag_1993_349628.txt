By early June , the four-ton , 30-ft. - long female minke whale was done with her winter sojourn in temperate waters . It was time to head back to the chilly Arctic for the summer . Traveling north , she and her fellow minkes would periodically dive down to gulp fish , then swim back to the surface to suck air through their blowhole  --  for like all whales , minkes are air-breathing mammals . They followed an age-old migratory track , invisible to humans but as well marked as an interstate highway to the whales . <P> Unfortunately for this particular whale , the track led directly up the coast of Norway  --  and on June 17 , into the path of the Ann Brita . A few minutes and a well-placed harpoon later , the minke 's destiny abruptly changed course . Instead of reaching the Arctic , she ended up on an auction block in the Norwegian port of Svolvaer , sold to the highest bidder for $2.50 a lb . This minke was the first of 160 hauled in by Norway this season for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ban on for-profit hunting established by the International Whaling Commission ( IWC ) in 1986 . ( More than 130 others were hunted legally for scientific purposes , although many environmentalists claim that the science involved was minimal . ) All the catches were fully approved by the Norwegian government . <P> Norway knew it was asking for trouble by going after whales for profit , but that did n't make the ensuing uproar any easier to take . Letters of protest have poured into Norway 's embassy in Washington . Environmental groups have called on consumers to boycott the country 's exports and on travelers to stay away from Norway , especially during next year 's Winter Olympics in Lillehammer . German and British companies have canceled several million dollars ' worth of contracts for Norwegian food . And the U.S. Commerce Department will decide within a week or two whether Norway 's actions make it potentially subject to trade restrictions on the more than $1 billion of Norwegian products exported to the U.S. every year . <P> Yet despite being branded an international outlaw and threatened with an economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Its resolve is strengthened by the confidence that other countries may follow : Iceland , which quit the IWC last year over the same issue , says it will resume whaling next summer , ban or no . Japan will abide by the rules for now , but has lobbied the IWC to allow limited whaling . All three nations argue that the current policy is governed by emotion , not rational science . They contend that a careful harvest of relatively plentiful species like the minke is harmless . Says Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland : " We can not allow uninformed sentiment to decide on the controlled use of our natural resources . "
