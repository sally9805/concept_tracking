On the cold , overcast afternoon of Dec. 16 , federal appeals court Judge Robert Vance received a package at his white-columned house in Mountain Brook , Ala. , a Birmingham suburb . The return address indicated that the parcel had been mailed by Vance 's old friend Senior Judge Lewis R. Morgan , who knew of Vance 's passion for animals . " I guess Judge Morgan sent me some more of those horse magazines , " Vance told his wife Helen . But as Vance eagerly opened the shoe box-size parcel , it exploded . Vance was killed instantly ; his wife was seriously injured . <P> Two days later two more parcel bombs appeared . One detonated in Savannah , killing Robert E. Robinson , an attorney and alderman . In Atlanta , police disarmed another lethal package ; it was addressed to the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit , on which Vance served . In Jacksonville , Fla. , local N.A.A.C.P. president Willye Dennis was in such a hurry to leave the office that she did not have time to unwrap a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning of Robinson 's death , she remembered the unopened box and called the sheriff 's office , which discovered inside it a bomb made with nails and smokeless powder . <P> In the search for a motive for the deadly mailings , many feared that Colombian cocaine dealers had opened a new front in their counteroffensive against the war on drugs by targeting the Eleventh Circuit , which handles many drug cases . Later a different but equally appalling rationale began to emerge : racial hatred . <P> White supremacists may have been angered at rulings by Vance in highly publicized federal court cases . He had joined in decisions that upheld the murder conviction of a member of the Aryan Brotherhood and allowed the prosecution to present evidence that led to the convictions of Ku Klux Klansmen involved in a bloody 1979 confrontation with blacks in Decatur , Ala . In September Vance wrote a bluntly worded reversal of a lower-court ruling that had lifted an 18-year-old desegregation order from the Duval County , Fla. , schools . The plaintiff in that case was the Jacksonville branch of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenge to a school desegregation plan for Savannah . <P> As chairman of the Alabama Democratic Party from 1966 to 1977 , the jovial , imposing ( 6 ft. 3 in . ) Vance was the epitome of the moderate Southerner intent on expanding the rights of blacks . Vance successfully integrated the party , in the process helping to remove from its seal the white rooster that had long served as a symbol of white supremacy . In 1968 he led the first racially mixed state delegation to the Democratic National Convention in Chicago . As a lawyer , Vance shocked the tight-knit legal community by breaking a gentlemen 's agreement to keep blacks off juries in Birmingham . President Jimmy Carter fulfilled Vance 's lifelong ambition by nominating him to the federal bench in 1977 . He became part of the Eleventh Circuit four years later .
