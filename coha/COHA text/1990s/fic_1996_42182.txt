FORESTERS WEAR PUTTEES , green or gray . This one never went anywhere without his rifle , just as he never went anywhere without being in a great hurry . When he came through the village he was always at a half-sprint , the dust stirring above his ankles . Everyone greeted him , but he greeted none , perhaps because he was always in such a desperate rush that he had no time to notice those who slowed down and stepped out of the way when they saw him coming . Sometimes they would move to the edge of the ditch by the side of the road and follow him with their heads . To these bystanders it looked as though he was being led by a dog on a long leash , a big , invisible dog to which he secretly whistled through his ever-pursed lips , and against which he set his hurried pace . He appeared so thoroughly engaged by the movement of this phantom hound that he could not be distracted by anything else . When he passed them , the villagers never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one another from time to time , as if to remind themselves of the association they all shared in the shape of that strange , invisible dog . <p> As he sprang up the concrete steps of Cederblom 's Grocery , the forester startled a small group of women who stood at the top , offering each other snuff . In sudden alarm , they jumped out of his way . Inside he unslung his rifle and stood there with his feet spread wide on the newly scrubbed floorboards , weighing the weapon by the shoulder strap until he found its perfect point of balance . Only then did he step forward to the counter , and all the eyes staring at him in curious bewilderment now slunk hastily off in other directions . The rifle butt came to rest firmly on the floor , the barrel sticking up an inch or two above the counter 's edge , and the two girls attending to customers suddenly looked nervous , even frightened , as they filled their customers ' bags and cartons . <p> When the forester 's turn came , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not even when he was told that something or other was out of stock would he trouble to speak . He would simply shake his head in displeasure and shrug his shoulders , as if to free himself of the annoyance . The forester always bought the same things , provisions for his excursions into the woods  --  canned goods , hard bread , goat 's cheese , oranges , coffee , condensed cream  --  and other essentially masculine things normally associated with strength , solitude , and superiority : puttees , boot grease of a particular brand , expensive pipe tobacco , the finest pipe cleaners , flasks for field use , and flints for his cigarette lighter . <p> When at last his goods were set before him , he would shove them into his pack himself , the very abruptness of his movement making any assistance from the shop clerk impossible . No one in the village had ever heard him ask for help , just as no one had ever heard him say thank you . No one had seen his match blow out in the wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone ever heard him swear because a stone had crept into his shoe . The forester was plagued by none of those things that made other people feel ridiculous , nothing that could be laughed or even smiled at . But the villagers were patient . <p> One day the forester came into the store and bought a woman 's head scarf . On this day he left his rifle and backpack at home . Nor was he wearing his gloves as usual . The villagers were surprised to see how small his hands were  --  so small and white , almost like a woman 's . The cigarette he was smoking also looked ridiculously small in the middle of his big , red face . From the moment he entered Cederblom 's he was acting out of the ordinary . Instead of immediately approaching the counter , he went over to a little glass case just to the left of the entrance . Inside were the sorts of things people usually paused and snickered at , but never bought : cheap necklaces , gaudy bathing caps , imitation gold bracelets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , earrings . What good would any of these things be to him in the middle of the woods ? Leaning over this museum of urban vanity , the forester stood for a good while , ardently puffing on his cigarette without ever taking it from his mouth . Finally it occurred to one of the clerks that she should offer her assistance . <p> He asked in a friendly but somewhat embarrassed tone if he could see some cloths , and the girl , misunderstanding , began to spread embroidered tablecloths and linens over the lid of the case . <p> " Not like that , " the forester said , spitting out his cigarette and crushing it under the toe of his boot . " The kind that goes on your head . " <p> The girl obviously did n't realize that the " cloth " was intended for a woman . " To keep warm ? " she asked . She could vaguely remember having seen people with toothaches wearing white cloths tied around their heads . <p> The forester looked into the glass case as if into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for . He walked around the case , which extended far into the room , and pulled out a drawer filled with scarves . He picked up the first one he saw , and after holding it up to look through the blotchy red translucent silk , he asked the girl in rapid , low syllables to wrap it for him . <p> Afterwards he stood for a few moments on the steps outside , trying to light a cigarette in the rain . Through the display window the girl saw him hurry past with his lips closed around the cigarette like a vise . Just before the bend in the road he stopped suddenly , took one of his delicate hands from his pocket , and held it out in the rain , as if he were about to taste it . But he continued on presently and was soon out of sight , even from the farthest of the store windows . It was odd , though . Very odd . <p> That night nearly everyone in the village knew about the forester 's scarf . Many were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down and they lay awaiting sleep in their kitchen beds with a cat curled up on the blankets , the low tones of conversation interrupted only occasionally by the sound of a car passing on the road . <p> The next morning , as usual , the schoolteacher 's wife rode up to Cederblom 's on her bicycle . Her name was Alice . Though raised in the city , she was the daughter of a farmer from a neighboring parish . It was a clear day ; the weather was warming up after the rain , and the door of the store stood wide open . As she was stepping across the threshold , Alice suddenly turned and ran back to her bike , as if she had forgotten to do something . She fiddled with the lock for a moment and then stuffed something into her handbag . When she came back up the steps her head was bare , but as she approached the counter she realized it was too late . A small group of women stood nearby fingering a roll of fabric , and they followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She knew then that they had probably seen her wearing the forester 's scarf , had seen and understood the weakness that compelled her to hide it in her handbag . And because of this the bag grew so heavy in her hands that she was barely able to lift it . The shopgirl 's expression made it heavier yet . When it came time to place her order , Alice 's face flushed a deep red . Suddenly she could n't remember a single thing she meant to buy . But since she did not wish to acknowledge her alarm , not even to herself , she asked for a number of unnecessary things , whatever popped into her head at the moment , including a pair of cuff links . <p> That was stupid , she thought as soon as she asked for them , doubly stupid with all of these other women standing right there . And when the shopkeeper opened her bag to help her with the items , she hated him , for there in front of everyone he pulled out the scarf , set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mouth : " It would be a shame to put all these heavy things on top of such a pretty little scarf . " <p> The forester rented a corner upstairs room in the teacher 's house . By midday he and the teacher 's wife were encircled in a net of speculation and suspicion . It was a wide net , still set at a distance , but with so many hands eagerly clutching it , their chances for escape were growing slim . <p> Of course , the talk of children is never worth heeding . But still , children can be dangerous ; they do n't have the tact to hold back the truth . The next day during lunch break the teacher was sitting at his desk . Through the half-open door he could hear one girl chasing another through the hallway , and he was about to go out and tell them to stop when the first girl was overtaken . Apparently unaware that he was inside , the girls stopped abruptly outside the classroom door . <p> " Who ? " cried the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Who ? Who-who-who ? " <p> " The forester " panted the other . <p> The two girls ran off giggling , leaving the teacher alone with his shame . Heated misgivings began to tickle his mind like a sweet , itching pain . When the children returned from recess he sat there at his desk , red in the face . At least it felt that way to him . He had to look down to reassure himself that he was n't naked . Though the air of the schoolroom was rife with midsummer heat , he buttoned his jacket and pulled up the zipper on his sport shirt all the way to his Adam 's apple . For the rest of the day he was not himself . He asked the students short , nervous questions , which he answered himself if the silence dragged on too long . And he avoided the two girls from recess altogether , not even daring to look toward the window near their seats . <p> When he came home that afternoon he could hear the forester walking back and forth up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene , he acted as if nothing was wrong , going out of his way to be friendly , nonchalant . But from this time on  --  perhaps without even realizing it  --  he began to collect evidence for his case . There is no such bloodhound , no such imaginative detective , no hunter so ruthless as a jealous husband . <p> The next day at recess he borrowed a bike from one of his colleagues . He told his class he had to take a very urgent telegram to the station and that perhaps he would return a few minutes late . He rode off in the direction of the station , but once he was alone on the road , he carefully turned off and pedaled down a little path through the woods . He rode quickly , the bicycle rattling over stones and roots . He would approach the house from the rear and take them by surprise . A few hundred yards from the back gate he slowed down , got off the bike , and leaned it against a tree . He would walk the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stepped behind a bush and lit a cigarette to strengthen his dignity in an otherwise undignified situation . The back gate was freshly oiled , so it did n't creak . He stepped lightly through the yard , and above the sounds of the birds chirping and the rope repeatedly slapping against the flagpole , he could hear low voices from the bower . He drew in thick clouds of smoke from his cigarette as he peeked through the newly clipped entrance . <p> They were lying there in the grass , though there was a table they could just as well have been using . Granted , they were only drinking coffee , and they lay on opposite sides of a large tray filled with coffee cups , plates , and a basket of cookies , but his wife was wearing a pretty scarf that he had never seen before . She was also smoking , which she never did . The tone of their conversation was so low that he could n't make out much of what they were saying , just bits and pieces really , though he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was short , much shorter than he had anticipated . So even before the teacher finished his cigarette , he made his way around to the front , threw open the door so that it could easily be heard , and stamped his feet as if he had snow on them . Then he moved to the mirror in the hallway and blew smoke at his own flat reflection to impress it . A few seconds later he heard his wife 's footsteps on the porch . As soon as she saw him , she stopped in her tracks . The scarf was no longer on her head . <p> " Oh , it 's you , " she said . " I thought I heard a sound in here . " <p> " So you did , " he said , flicking his cigarette onto the floor and leaving it there for her to stamp out . Then he went through the door and brusquely down the steps . He whistled as he passed the bower , which was completely silent now in the midday heat . But no  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear his throat and set his cup on a plate . <p> While the teacher was riding back through the woods , he came unexpectedly upon a small woman whose clothes were drenched in sweat . Right where the path suddenly curved she was collecting pine cones and putting them in a sack . She was Mrs. Mattsson , the mother of one of the girls he 'd overheard in the hallway . As he pedaled past , he could tell from her expression that she would ponder a great deal over this strange midday meeting in the middle of the woods when he was supposed to be at the school , teaching . Stupid , he thought . Stupid , but unavoidable . <p> Alice got a broom and a dustpan from the kitchen and swept up the tobacco and ashes . Then she drank a few glasses of water and walked around opening windows to keep from suffocating . It was windy , and she found this a great relief as she leaned out the big living room window , allowing the breeze to fan the heat of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ web with small , unmerciful threads was closing around her body . She had to stick her hands inside her dress and drag her fingers across the skin to convince herself it was all in her head . She wanted to run , but in a direction that did not exist , neither toward the bower nor toward Cederblom 's nor the road , the school , or the woods . <p> Now it sounded as if someone was coming through the gate . She heard the latch clang as it banged shut beyond the bower . A moment later Alice saw the sweaty little woman marching across her lawn , a large sack trailing behind her in the grass . The woman passed very , very close to the bower . As Alice stood at the window she bit her lip , hoping the forester would not suddenly call out to her , or come charging out , eager to grab her and pull her toward him as he often did when they were alone . Alice hurried out and met the woman on the steps of the porch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stone walk , and pulled the hair off her sweaty forehead . Then she looked Alice in the eyes with an expression that was utterly inscrutable , neither kind nor malicious . All the same , Alice found it confusing , and she could n't think of a thing to say . She simply looked down at the sack and then past the sack toward the bower . She noticed then that Mrs. Mattsson was beginning to look in the same direction , so she had to do something to divert the woman 's attention . She wet her tongue to ask the farmer 's wife what she wanted , but the little woman beat her to the punch . <p> Posing a question that really was n't a question , she lifted the sack and said , " Mind if I walk across your yard ? This sack , it 's so heavy , and it 's shorter for me this way . " <p> It sounded all right . If she 'd only held her eyes still it might have sounded even better . But they were wandering all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to the forester 's bedroom and down to the yard , between the apple trees , hovering for a moment like a hawk , unmoving , over the bower . It was as if she could see into it , even though she was standing there on the walk beside Alice , breathing heavily from her exertion . <p> " Naturally , Mrs. Mattsson , " said Alice at last , reaching down to help with the sack . <p> But Mrs. Mattsson would not accept her help . She became suspicious , in fact , when she saw that Alice was so eager to assist her , and so she found various pretexts for dawdling there in front of the porch . There were invisible cats to lure out of the bushes , flowers to admire , and aromas to savor as she let her eyes rove over the yard and the house . <p> " It 's such a nice place you have , " she said , looking Alice in the eyes one last time . Then , at last , she picked up the sack and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alice , never saying hello or good-bye , looking at you with such insolence whenever they feel like dropping by , whenever they feel like leaving . <p> Then of course it had to happen  --  as the woman was trudging away , just as she was opening the front gate  --  the one thing Alice most feared . The forester called out to her . <p> " Alice Where the hell are you ? " <p> At that moment Alice seemed to be hearing his voice for the very first time . Her entire body went stiff . The gate took an eternity to close , and when at last the latch clanged it brought her back to life . She rushed back up the steps , through the hallway , and up the stairs to the second floor . The sitting room door was open . Rushing in , she locked it behind her and collapsed in a big chair . A few moments later the forester was knocking at the door . Though she refused to open it at first , she finally gave in and did so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filling his pipe with tobacco , oblivious to everything . <p> Thoroughly preoccupied by this task , he glanced up and said , " What the hell 's wrong with you ? " <p> Alice lose control . She could n't bear such apathy . The situation was so foreign to her that she found herself completely incapable of mastering it . All the dread over what had already happened between them , dammed up throughout the spring by new caresses , clandestine pleasures , all of it flowed out from her now in a long shriek , an outburst of shame and fear . <p> She had imagined many times before what her defiance might lead to , but she 'd really only toyed with the thought of ultimately getting caught . She had allowed her thoughts to race skyward like rockets , had reveled in their blinding glare as she burrowed her head into his flesh . They often pulled down the shades in his room for a few hours in the middle of the day to pretend it was night . They made one another strong , each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him as into a cave , and in the soft warmth of that dim retreat the hostile outer world seemed comically weak , laughable , small . The long periods between their respites in the forester 's room had been like bridges between small , delightful islands . It was these bridges that enabled her to understand the sensual bond she was developing with this man , her lover , a bond that grew stronger with the passage of time . They were bridges of memory  --  memories of a fingertip on a breast , a bite on the shoulder , a kiss on the neck , the long glide of a hand down her back . <p> The fear of discovery had been but a game , for until now she had not been alone for a moment . But now she realized at last that discovery would strand her , alone  --  so terribly alone that nothing could possibly help her , least of all this man who stood in her room stuffing his pipe with his short , stunted lover 's movements . She found herself standing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bridge that connected to nothing . She was surrounded by water . Whichever way she turned , only fog and darkness lay before her . And discovery no longer seemed a game . It was of no help that she was once strong . It made no difference that she had once been able to slip into his arms and build a wall of his flesh . Because discovery was n't like a flash of light , blinding one moment , gone the next . No . Discovery was a state of monotonous suffering . It was the endless gossip of a few hundred hicks , farmers , lumber workers , local hotshots , not to mention their wives . That 's what frightened Alice the most . The air was filled with Mrs. Mattsson 's eyes . And it was this thought that made her cry out . <p> " I 'm tired of this I 'm tired of having the whole village peeking around the corner . I 'm tired of people grinning whenever I step out the front gate . I 'm tired of people clustering together and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road . I 'm tired of being the forester 's whore " <p> " Alice , has someone said that ? " <p> " And you You 're so stupid , you ca n't see anything . If you were the least bit concerned about me you would n't let me go through this But you do n't give me the respect of a scroungy dog .... You ... you ... you " <p> By then the forester had wrapped his arms around her bead . She had his shirt-sleeve in her mouth , and once the words stopped coming she found herself frantically tired . In that state she allowed herself to be led into his room . She lay on his bed , stroking the flowered bedspread with her fingers . I was raining . The running water blurred the windowpanes . In the bower , the rain was probably ruining her cakes , overflowing the cups and the cream dish , but she could n't bring herself to go down there . Instead , she lay on the bed listening to the forester , who had moved to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was telling her that of course he understood everything . He knew very well what it meant in a little hick town like this when people began to gossip about a married woman and another man . But really , it had only been that thing with the scarf that was stupid . He admitted it . Perhaps that could be thought of as proof of something . But otherwise had n't they always been careful ? Had she ever been in his room when her husband returned from school ? Had he ever so much as touched her when someone else was around ? Had they ever been seen together on the road or in the park ? And had n't they been very careful about their meetings , her mentioning to her husband the day before that the forester would be in the woods for the whole day , then standing in the kitchen preparing his lunch the night before to put all suspicions to rest ? Had n't he always left the house early on those mornings , biding his time in the woods until he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as discreetly as possible , always along the back roads , the hidden paths , ready at any moment to dive into a nearby bush at the slightest sound ? <p> " You seem to forget that Arne came home today , " said Alice . " We could just as well have been in your room then . " <p> " Arne came home , " he repeated calmly . " Maybe he saw the scarf on the hat shelf , wondered where it came from , drew his own conclusions . It must have put him at ease when he sneaked up only to find us having coffee in the bower . " <p> " And Mrs. Mattsson , " said Alice . " What about her ? It never occurred to her to use our yard as a shortcut before , and she 's been passing by here all her life . " <p> " Mrs. Mattsson , " the forester echoed . He began carving a ruler with his knife . " She probably passed Arne in the woods and got curious . " <p> " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that when you knew she was here " <p> " I thought she was gone . Besides , there 's nothing strange about me calling out to you . I 've been living here quite some time . " <p> " But you swore at me And men only do that to their mistresses . " <p> " All right , I 've been a little careless , " said the forester calmly as he tried to look through the tear-blinded window . " I admit it . Maybe we 've both been a little careless . You did n't have to wear my scarf into the store . But listen . There 's nothing that ca n't be fixed  --  not even carelessness . You fix that by being twice as careful as before . We 're going to be so cautious that everyone will feel stupid about their suspicions . If we 've ever looked at each other when we 're having our coffee at night with Arne , then from now on we 'll never give each other as much as a sidelong glance . Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you can , I can , " said Alice . She felt very tired . She watched the rain as it ran down the window . A butcher 's shop window , she thought , and laughed a little  --  just a small laugh , barely noticeable . Not that the forester noticed it anyway . He was busy unzipping his tobacco pouch . He took out a pinch and crumpled it to separate the leaves . <p> " We 'll be polite to each other , " he said . " But no more . Definitely no more . <p> " Definitely not , " she said . " Definitely not . Definitely not . " <p> The forester was surprised to hear her say it a third time . Sometimes she would tease him with her goddamned superiority by repeating his words in her voice , but with his tone . It was like looking at yourself in a broken mirror . " How long are you going to keep that up ? " he would ask her . " As long as I damn well please , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well please for a very long while , until at last he threw her violently to the bed , her lips , like charged magnets , dragging his own helplessly toward them . <p> The rain poured and poured . The forester had just lit his pipe and was drawing smoke in through his childishly rounded lips . On his desk ticked an alarm clock that rang at one in the afternoon when the blinds were drawn . Definitely not , thought Alice , though she could n't remember why . The forester took the pipe from his mouth . <p> " The trick is simply to wait , " he said , fingering its stem . " Do you think you can learn to wait ? " <p> " For what ? " <p> " For the right moment . Is n't Arne going on some school trip ? " <p> " June 6 , " said Alice . She was sitting now on the edge of the bed , looking out at the sky , which had begun to clear . Her eyes were fixed in the middle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to stand up to compete for her attention . He paced back and forth , each time stepping barely to the side for her feet , but never touching her . <p> " Two weeks , " he said , stopping in front of the window . " Can you wait that long ? " <p> She was looking at his back as he said this . Shake just a little , she prayed . But the forester 's back was completely still . She rose from the bed and moved across the silent carpet toward the door , looking over her shoulder to see if the mute back would notice her . But it was blind and noticed nothing . <p> Yet when her own back brushed against the door , the forester stirred and turned slowly . He sat back on the windowsill . <p> " All right , " he said . " For two weeks we 'll forget about each other . Do you think you can manage ? " <p> But Alice did n't respond as he 'd expected . Curtseying in the doorway with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet again , Herr Forester . " <p> When he was alone , the forester sat down again at his desk and began to leaf through a book about hunting . He decided to go on a night hunt , so he wound the alarm clock and set it for midnight . Then he stole to the door and turned the key . In one of his desk drawers was a small bottle of brandy , something he saved for special occasions , to help stiffen his resolve in difficult times . He took a glass from the shelf and poured a little , very little , into it . He poured the exact amount that a man of character would pour . Holding the glass to the light , he was pleased with himself for having poured such a moderate amount . Then he tossed it back in one painful gulp . He poured out the same amount a few times more , and each time he was equally pleased by the strength of his character . <p> All at once the sun appeared and struck him in the eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blinds , he saw Alice coming out of the bower toward the house . She was carrying the remains of their interrupted meal on a red tray that cast a friendly reflection on the grass where she was walking . Her shoulders looked tired , and she appeared to be leaning on the tray for support , bearing her fatigue and the beginnings of despair before her as she kept her eyes desperately fixed on the tray , trying to keep it all from tumbling out of her grasp . As he saw her there , the forester was moved by a sudden feeling of tenderness for the teacher 's wife . Leaning over the desk , following her quiet path to the house with his eyes , he felt the pleasure of this tenderness awaken in his body . <p> " You dear little woman , " he said through a closed mouth and <p> still throat . And yet the words seemed to rise into the room and hover in its thick air , smelling of kindness , the forester 's kindness . He was overcome by an inexpressible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to figure out why he felt that way , he persuaded himself that it was because of his tactful handling of this business with Alice and the schoolteacher . After Alice went back into the house , he felt himself vaguely deserving of one more snort of brandy , and as a sort of reward he allowed himself perhaps slightly more than would normally befit a man of character . <p> He locked the bottle in the drawer again and took his rifle out of the closet . He laid it across the desk and wiped away the dust that had collected on the barrel with a piece of blotting paper . Then he detached the breech and closed his eyes as he ran his fingers over its hard , polished surface . For a whole week the rifle had been stowed away in the closet , and now , as he set the breech into place , he did so with tender , gliding movements . He raised the rifle . Pulling the stock tight against his shoulder , he aimed it into the bower . It would have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it on , or at least a sparrow , or a few bottles . He had a pet notion about standing at the window or sitting in his chair , or perhaps even lying on the bed , and firing at bottles suspended from balloons . But there were neither bottles nor owls nor sparrows out there at the moment . Just then , however , the gate leading to the woods let out a loud squeak . And suddenly there was the teacher , coming down the path with a stack of books under one arm . He was smoking a cigarette and sweating profusely . Of course it was very stupid of the forester , but by the time he realized that he was standing in plain view aiming his rifle at the teacher , it was too late to do anything about it . Naturally , the gun was n't loaded , but it was a very stupid thing to do in any case . <p> The teacher found his wife in the kitchen . She was at the sink , drying coffee cups and dishes that until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The tray was not hanging up as usual , but lying on the kitchen table with some spilt coffee still on it . He noticed each of these things before he greeted his wife . Then he sat on a stool and prepared to drop the bomb . <p> " You did n't come home the usual way , " commented his wife , wiping the tray and hanging it on the wall . <p> " I went through the woods , " he said as he began weighing the books in his hand , one at a time . " I thought it might be quicker . Maybe I was wrong . " <p> " Mrs. Mattsson came through the yard today . She thought that was quicker . " <p> " Well , I wo n't be doing that again , " her husband said , staring at her so intently that at last she could n't keep her own eyes still . <p> " Why 's that ? " she said , hesitating . <p> Bang The teacher slammed the books down suddenly on the table . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before he went on . <p> " I do n't feel like getting shot through the window , " he said at last , with such nonchalance that the effect was doubly unnerving . <p> Alice sank into a chair at the other side of the table , and then the two of them sat there looking deep into each other 's eyes for a few moments . This time her wide eyes fled nowhere . But the dumbstruck expression on her face did not result from feelings of dread or a guilty conscience , as her husband imagined , but rather from pure astonishment . <p> " Shot ? " she repeated , cracking a grin . It sounded so absurdly melodramatic . <p> Her husband rose slowly to his feet . Like a lion tamer , he sank his eyes into hers . <p> " Just a minute ago the forester was standing at his window , " he said in a voice as even and nonchalant as before . " Aiming a rifle at me . " <p> At once Alice 's face turned a flaming red , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't help noticing this . He turned somewhat dramatically and walked to the window , and Alice could do nothing but helplessly stare at his back . Her first impulse was to jump up , spin him around , and hurl everything she could at him in defense of the forester . But then , as her emotions settled , she became calmer , more clearheaded , and by the time she pushed her chair back she had thought of a way to preserve everyone 's dignity , to placate everyone 's conscience , to restore everyone 's damaged feelings . <p> " Arne , " she said , repeating his name insistently until he finally turned around . " Arne , you have to go up there right now and demand an explanation . If not for yourself , then for my sake . Do you think I like the idea of being home alone with some lunatic who goes around aiming guns at people ? If you do n't go up there right now I wo n't feel safe in this house for another minute . Besides , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that Tell him that " <p> They started up the stairs together , Alice leading the way , keeping several steps ahead of her husband . The teacher followed reluctantly , half-stunned by an unexpected though gratifying fact  --  or two facts . Lunatic , she had said . And in such an angry tone . And it 's a crime . Besides , it 's a crime . People go to jail for things like that And so he went along . <p> Before he knew it , there they all were . The forester was standing before them in his doorway , his hair mussed . He blinked a few times , stupidly , as if he 'd been sleeping and was hastily awakened . Alice was abrupt . She did n't even allow him to catch his breath . <p> " Sir , my husband said you were pointing your rifle at him when he came through the yard . " <p> The forester backed a few steps into his room , sat on the edge of his desk , and fingered his knees . He let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistake , " he said , looking at the floor . " I wanted to see if the rifle was clean . So I took it out and was sighting it on something in the yard , and ... well , unfortunately Arne happened to come walking down the path just when ... but like I said  --  " <p> " Yes , yes , of course , " said the teacher . " It was just a little unnerving . You know , to look up and see ... well , you understand . " <p> On their way down the stairs , the teacher leaned toward his wife and whispered , " Since when have you started calling him ' sir ' ? " <p> Alice stopped and looked up at him with an almost frantic determination . <p> " Since today , " she said . " He made a couple of stupid comments about you coming home in the middle of the day . So then I told him I thought he was taking a few too many liberties of that sort around here . And as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's what I told him . Just like that scarf he had the nerve to give me . I 'm sure you 've seen that . " <p> " No , " her husband lied . <p> When they reached the bottom of the stairs , Alice took the scarf down from the shelf . Her husband studied her smile , comparing it with others on similar occasions , trying to determine whether it was counterfeit . Alice likewise observed his expression as he turned the scarf over in his hands , and by the exaggerated attention of his eyes she could tell he had already been aware of it . This worried her a little . She climbed out of herself and stood by , correcting every movement before she made it so that each gesture would carry absolute credibility . <p> That evening the forester did not come down for coffee as usual . For a while they could hear him pacing in his room . Then he lay down on his bed . The springs creaked . Quite some time passed before they heard another sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry for himself , " said Alice when her husband commented on the forester 's absence . " First because I snubbed him today , and now because of this business with the gun . " <p> It all sounded quite on the level . As the teacher spread honey on his roll , he scrutinized all the different parts of his wife 's face , but everything held together . Later that night , just after they got into bed , they heard the forester 's heavy footsteps on the stairs . He left the house and headed into the woods . The teacher lay back , calmly and clearly weighing the various pieces of evidence . On one side were all the things that seemed to indicate guilt ; on the other , innocence . His wife crept over into his bed . At first this made him glad , but then he grew suspicious , because he was almost always the one to take the initiative . He lay beside her , silently running through two mental lists , first of the incriminating and then of the vindicating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the warmth of her body , he became ever more convinced of her innocence . Until finally he felt freer and happier than he had in a very long time . He fell asleep quite late , with a bit of her hair closed between his teeth . <p> Alice , on the other hand , lay awake for a long time , the scenes of the day replaying over and over in her mind . Cautiously she freed her hair from her husband 's mouth and moved away . When she lay down on the cold sheets of her own bed , she wanted to scream from the pain of those fourteen days that separated her from happiness  --  that sweet , dangerous happiness , the happiness that bites . She did not cry out , but she did lie awake most of the night . <p> At dawn the forester came home from his hunt . Alice awoke when she heard sounds from the porch below , and she sat up quickly in bed . The room was very warm , so she got up and opened a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ porch and not long afterwards hard steps on the stairway . She remembered then how the forester had gone on the night hunt . <p> She went out to the porch in her bare feet anyway , to see what had caused the loud noise . A large white bundle had been thrown on the floor . Startled , she stopped short before a stiff white wing with blood on its tip , a frozen , mangled block of blood and feathers . The dead bird , the raw morning mist creeping through the yard , the threatening silence that hovered over the village : all of it flung her back inside the house , where she stopped before the mirror . She stood looking into it , massaging the color back into her cheeks and feeling rather sorry for herself , so frightened , so alone . <p> Suddenly she thought , I have to talk with him . Right now . He has to help me . He ca n't leave me alone like this . <p> She took the scarf from the shelf and wrapped it around her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she heard no sign of her husband stirring in the bedroom , she ran lightly up the stairs . She barely dared to touch the steps , she was so afraid of getting caught . And she did n't knock on the forester 's door , because a knock would almost certainly wake her husband if he was still sleeping . Instead she just opened it , very slowly . <p> She opened it so slowly , in fact , that the forester was caught entirely off guard . Standing there on the threshold , Alice felt a chill run through her body . Her first impulse was to turn and run back down the stairs , because what she saw filled her with a disgust so complete that she could not endure it without screaming . Or so she thought at first . There are certain situations we do not wish to see our loved ones in , as the unworthiness of their behavior damages our own pride . Their pitifulness becomes in every sense our own . And in such situations it is only by breaking from them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The silence drew out to an exasperating length , but the forester did not yet notice Alice standing in the doorway . Her eyes filled slowly with warm tears . Offended , abandoned , she absorbed every detail of the scene before her . The glass in the forester 's right hand was nearly full . What indulgence When he 's had enough of me , she thought , he switches to brandy . She took in his profile , his swollen , red , drunken , sated profile . How could she have ever loved it ? Or had she never really seen it before And then the left hand . She stared particularly long at what he was doing with that hand , for this was what held her captive and filled her with such disgust . <p> In his lap rested a dead squirrel , a large splendid creature he 'd shot on the hunt . With his left hand he was caressing it , not so much tenderly as amiably , as one might do to a pet . His expression was not at all cruel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women give themselves to him , thought Alice . A caresser who can only love with his hands . <p> Of course , he was bound to notice her eventually . No one can be the object of such intense thoughts without somehow sensing it . A sharp thought scratched his cheek . He turned slowly toward the door , his caressing hand clenched in defense . The moment he set eyes on Alice , he tried to stand up , to put his dignity back on its feet , but with a motion of her hand she enjoined him to remain seated . <p> To be caught sitting If only he 'd been standing , then at least he could have looked down at her . He felt himself diminishing before her eyes until his shoulders were little more than a hanger for his forester 's coat to dangle on . <p> " What are you doing here ? " he asked in a dark voice . He tried to get rid of the glass as discreetly as possible . <p> " You do n't normally ask me that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the threshold pressing against her bare feet . It hurt them , but right now that pleased her . It was all right for something to hurt as long as it reminded her of the obligations she had to her hate . Gently she untied the forester 's colored scarf and took it from her hair . <p> The forester maintained his calm , making no attempt to stop her . He did n't jump up with a lover 's entreaties . How could you be so cold ? How could you reject something I gave from the heart ? No . And he made no move to charge forward , grasp her in his arms , and conquer her , though he recognized this as one way of dealing with the situation . Instead he just sat there , calmly formulating his defense . She had caught him sitting down  --  caught him . And that 's just what he felt like , a captive . It was like being hauled before a judge , though she had accused him of nothing . But he sat there devising a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective than toppling the moral base on which your accuser stands ? <p> The forester slowly turned away . He looked at his glass . There was n't much in it . As befits a man of character , it was almost fully empty . So he lifted it from the desk pad and , holding it up as an argument for his own excellence , he turned to her again with vehemence . There was an ominous shine to his eyes . I , he thought with an exclamation mark . I can not even sit in my rented room and have a few drops of brandy in solitude And as for my prey , why ca n't I take it up to my expensive room without you being scandalized ? And that you  --  you , of all people  --  should say it ( though she had , in fact , said nothing ) . You So attached to hypocrisy that you force others to be hypocritical Force them to swear to you that they never touch a drop Coerce promises that they will never kill for pleasure You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're doing . Down to your own level . Do you think I ca n't see that ? <p> But he was not about to give her the satisfaction . Now he would be the one to set the trap . As if he could n't figure out why she chose to intrude on him at this time of day . He raised the glass to his lips and took a drink , a little nip to clear his throat . <p> " Did n't we agree not to see each other like this for a couple of weeks ? " <p> His voice was thick with suppressed emotion . This sudden attack on his dignity nearly brought tears to his eyes , or at least a misty haze . The steam of the fury boiling within him dampened the windows of his soul . <p> Then at last it happened . The scene . The Big Scene . Enough to make him want to shade his eyes , something he would gladly have done if decorum did not prohibit it . Alice 's bare white feet now crossed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room . They were trembling , both from a desire to kick him and a longing to run away . And yet , contrary to his expectations , she did not yell . Her voice was a tightly stretched wire onto which her words stepped delicately out . If one single word were too heavy , the wire would snap . <p> " You have it good , " she said to him . " You have your rifle and your brandy . You do n't have to lie awake all night . No one talks about you in the stores . No one gossips about you in their kitchens . No one thinks you 're ridiculous . No one finds you shameful , because you 're not cheating on anyone  --  no one but me . Who does n't cheer when someone deceives a deceiver ? Two weeks is easy for you . A nice little holiday . Imagine , fourteen days that you do n't have to kiss and caress me . How wonderful Imagine not having to be in love for fourteen whole days . What an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words appeared to have no effect on the forester . Truth be told , he was n't touched by them in the least , for the simple reason that he did n't understand  --  or even hear  --  a thing that Alice said . He just sat there waiting for her to end so that he could say his line  --  The Line  --  the one that would bring him peace of mind and clearly establish who was right and who was wrong . Even a playwright who suddenly discovers that One Irresistible Line in the midst of a frantic dress rehearsal could n't have more eagerly awaited the perfect moment to make his voice heard . <p> Finally , Alice was quiet . Her feet no longer shook . They stood firmly on the forester 's rug , and they would not move till she heard his lips pray for forgiveness . Not that she felt particularly forgiving  --  but who can resist wielding the power to answer a prayer The forester sat up in his chair , and it squeaked . He straightened his back . His eyes became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the glass . Lucky it 's not plastic , thought Alice . If it were plastic you 'd be lost . <p> " I an a man of character , " said the forester . He emphasized the " I " and looked sadly dignified when he said it , as if he were eminently pained at having to remind her of such a self-evident truth . He then finished his drink , and not even the brandy could make a dent in the composure of a face so controlled by that sentiment . <p> For Alice this marked the end of it . She suddenly found herself standing there peering down into Mrs. Mattsson 's face . Mrs. Mattsson 's eyes stared harshly and judgmentally back into her own . You have no character , the eyes told her . You 're an impenitent , lost soul , disgraced in this village . She wanted to cry out . But the lonely  --  in the truest sense of that word , lonely  --  they do n't bother to cry out their despair , because the act would be meaningless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do things with her hands that even a desert could n't ignore . She could scratch the desert sand until its desert face bled . <p> Shhhht <p> Suddenly two pieces of a brightly colored scarf were lying in the forester 's lap . And Alice was n't firmly rooted in front of him any longer . A sob choked between her teeth , she ran out in wild , headlong flight . This of course only strengthened the forester 's conviction that he was in the right . Those capable of maintaining composure always imagine they 're in the right . <p> The door slammed behind Alice . <p> Hysterical idiot , he thought to himself , without an ounce of compassion . Then he sank back into an undignified slump . She 's closed that door for the last time . At that point a little more brandy seemed like it would do the trick . And so he filled the glass . A few moments later he took up his rifle and aimed it out at the sky . But no brandy bottle came sailing beneath a balloon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teacher had heard voices in his dreams . But the bang of the door shook him from those dreams and made him sit up in bed . When his wife slowly turned the doorknob on her way into the room , he lay back again with the painful assurance that he knew everything now . As he wrapped the blankets around himself , his memory of the night 's pleasures remained as yet in his limbs . It was humiliating to think he had so recently made love with an unfaithful woman . It made him an accomplice of sorts to the infidelity without strengthening the force of his indignation . Nothing can paralyze the will like the memory of pleasure . When she entered the room , he feigned sleep . <p> She decided to wake him . The tender warmth of her attempts to entice him from sleep convinced him , eventually , that something had happened between her and the forester . Perhaps the affair had come to an end . But the thought was no comfort . The most humiliating fact of all remained : while he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone to another man 's room . Betrayal in absentia was possibly forgivable  --  it was like letting down your own soul . But to betray the warm body of someone there beside you was an unpardonable offense . The teacher 's body stiffened at her touch , but finally he had to go through the motions of waking to keep from giving himself away . He began a long and awkward theatrical waking scene , stretching his body in every direction , yawning and then mumbling a number of incomprehensible half-phrases from the deep of his throat . Alice ran her hands along the skin beneath his pajamas . With his eyes still closed he grabbed her wrist deliberately and removed it from his body , wishing to demonstrate how much his subconscious condemned her unfaithfulness . As soon as his eyes were fully open , she crept from the edge of the bed in close to his body . <p> " Arne , " she said . " Take me with you . " <p> " Where ? " he blurted out in a voice that sounded much more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so desperately afraid of being stranded again in the desert  --  so afraid of the desert itself  --  that she did not pick up on the telltale inconsistencies in her husband 's voice . <p> " On the school trip , " she said , close to sobbing . She searched for her husband 's eyes , for eyes that would love her , that would look at her as they had a few hours before , black and glazed from lust . <p> He sat bolt upright in bed and looked out the window , into the yard . And there and then any memories of lust disappeared altogether . His body grew heavy and dignified , as if pregnant . School trip , he thought . Images from school appeared in his mind  --  images at first glance innocent , but put into their proper context , terrible : two girls ' heads leaning together , their eyes sweeping over him cursorily , shamefully ; one girl shouting out " The forester " in the corridor ; a group of teachers abruptly ending their conversation as he entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawn together , a host of eyes fixed on them for four hundred miles . No thank you <p> " That 's out of the question , " he said curtly . He could now be as awake as he pleased . <p> " But why ? " she pleaded , believing to the last that there must be some technicality , some matter of policy , placing obstacles before them . <p> Her husband settled against the headboard , pulling his shoulders back as if engaged in some gymnastics performance . He folded his hands on his stomach , a man pregnant with his own honor . Because I 'm ashamed would sound idiotic . Because I 'm afraid would sound cowardly . <p> " Because I 'm a man of character , " he said . This , on the other hand , sounded terrific . <p> But as soon as the words passed his lips , his wife transformed before his eyes into a tight bundle of laughter . Shaking in paroxysms of laughter , she rolled around on the bed . <p> Her husband just stared at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't even cry . A crying woman is very practical . You can comfort , or even forgive , a crying woman without losing your dignity . It can even be a somewhat pleasant experience to pour out your comfort into the mold of a crying woman . But a laughing woman A laughing despair These are simply not legitimate . With a laughing woman there 's nothing you can do ... except let her go on laughing ... pull the blanket back over your head ... turn on your side ... go back to sleep . <p>
