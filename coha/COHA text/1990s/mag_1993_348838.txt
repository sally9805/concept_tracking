FRESH OFF A CONFRONTATION WITH HOLLYWOOD HOT SHOTS ON health-care issues , Clinton adviser JAMES CARVILLE is still talking tough about Tinseltown . He offended some at a White House meeting that included producer Gary David Goldberg and Barbra Streisand . Says Carville now : " If a Hollywood producer who makes $20 million a year thinks I 'm arrogant , that 's unfortunate . If a $20,000-a-year computer programmer in Holly Springs , Mississippi , thinks I 'm arrogant , that 's a tragedy . "
