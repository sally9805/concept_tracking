You ca n't look at great portraits today without a certain nostalgia . The painted portrait is a form that , like blank-verse drama in the theater or the caryatid in architecture , would seem to be on its last legs . Indeed , with few exceptions , it has no legs and seems unlikely to grow new ones . Photography took them away . But older portraits have hardly lost their magic and their grip on the imagination . This is why " Portraits by Ingres : Image of an Epoch , " which is on view ( through April 25 ) at the National Gallery in London , and will be seen later this year at the National Gallery of Art in Washington and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City , is such an invigorating show . <P> And the subtitle fits . Almost from the time they left the easel , the portraits of Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres ( 1780-1867 ) were seen as being more than personal likenesses . They had a defining character . Ingres 's period has coalesced around his art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was in Italy , the Mecca of the aspiring French painter , his pencil drawings caught the upper crust of foreigners there  --  the milords Anglais and their families on the Grand Tour , the French officials who ran Napoleon 's kingdom in Italy , his fellow expatriate artists  --  with stylish brio and steely exactness . It is fascinating to see him shifting through different levels of notation  --  for example , between the subtle , continuous modeling of the face of Mrs. Charles Badham ( 1816 ) and the brisker , more linear treatment of her shawl and clothes , and the subtle ghost traces of Roman architecture behind her . Nobody understood this medium better than Ingres , and the show contains some of the most exquisite pencil drawings ever made . <P> Back in France after 1824 , Ingres created a gallery of the rich and the powerful ( bankers , royalty , a newspaper owner , beautiful femmes du monde ) that seems to define the high society of its day as fully as Felix Nadar 's photographs recorded the artistic elites of the 1850s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hated it . It was both hackwork and the vehicle of some of his highest instincts as an artist . It drove him crazy : " I do n't know how to draw anymore , " this greatest of 19th century draftsmen moaned to a friend . " I do n't know anything anymore . A portrait of a woman ! Nothing in the world is more difficult ; it 's not doable . I 'm starting it over . It 's enough to make a man cry . " And he undoubtedly meant it . <P> " Pupil of David , history-painter . " So he identified himself : heir to the Great Cham of French neoclassicism , Jacques-Louis David , and practitioner of the most exalted kind of art , the art that interpreted myth and history to an educated audience . ( He never painted a still life and rarely did landscapes except as background to human figures . ) But classicism means different things to different artists , and we need an idea of what it meant to him . It had very little to do with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statuary . Other and lesser artists who had been through David 's teaching studio believed it did , and had fine theories to support their belief . But Ingres had a horror of theory , and like his 17th century predecessor Nicolas Poussin , he was much more interested in flesh than in marble .
