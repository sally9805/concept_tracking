<p> Five school boys wolfing down ice cream as they strolled through a Soweto mall caught Solomon Sikakane 's fatherly , entrepreneurial eye . <p> " These little chaps , these are our clients , " Sikakane said . " We 're going to make use of them . " <p> Sikakane and partner Barbara Malk are pioneers they are opening a book store in South Africa 's largest black township . On Monday , they began to stock the shelves of their long , narrow shop in a corner of Soweto 's Dobsonville Mall . <p> None of South Africa 's major book store chains ventured into Soweto when the Dobsonville center opened last year , giving this community of 4 million its first upscale mall . Other than a few small church-run shops specializing in religious literature , Soweto never really had a book store before Sikakane and Malk arrived . <p> Sikakane , a retired black school teacher , and Malk , a white homemaker recently returned from a 15-year stay in the United States , admit it 's a gamble . A recent study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a seventh grade level . <p> The store 's manager , Sikakane said his business plan is to target young readers to try to develop a " culture of learning " early . He plans to bring in teachers to read to groups of youngsters in the store , and most of the stock will be children 's books . <p> He named the store Imfundo-Thuto Imfundo means " education " in Zulu and related languages , and Thuto means the same in Sotho , another African language . <p> Before opening , Sikakane handed out samples of his wares to children in his Soweto neighborhood . <p> " You must tell me what you want to read , " he told them . The children returned with a list of favorite books he turned into an inventory . <p> Sikakane , son of a Lutheran minister , grew up with books .

" I know how it 's held me back I never had the confidence to get a paying job after my children were born . <p> " One needs to fortify oneself with knowledge . " <p> Malk , whose husband is a real estate developer in San Diego , California , poured 50,000 rand ( about dlrs 13,700 ) in start-up funds into Imfundo-Thuto . Sikakane said he would invest part of his salary into the business . <p> The small , black-owned venture is relatively rare in South Africa , where whites still control most business a year after the first all-race election ended white minority rule . Black entrepreneurs complain of difficulty in obtaining loans or raising capital . <p> ( db-tsc ) <p> Mooroogiah Naidoo , a South African anti-apartheid figure who spent 14 years in exile , died June 1 of emphysema at age 75 . <p> Known as M.D. , he was a lawyer who belonged to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ANC armed wing Spear of the Nation and the African Indian Congress . <p> He was jailed for six months for organizing a 1946 campaign to defy laws prohibiting land sales between Indians and non-Indians , and later received a five-year sentence for his Communist Party work , along with helping a person on bail escape the country and possessing a banned book . <p> The 1967 conviction caused his automatic disbarment . Naidoo left South Africa in 1977 and joined the exile community in London . He returned to Durban in 1991 and gained reinstatement as a lawyer so he could continue his practice . <p> Naidoo was survived by a daughter , Sukthi . Both his sons died previously , including one killed in a political assassination in Lusaka , Zambia , in 1989 . <p> ( tsc ) <p> President Kim Young-sam on Monday renewed his proposal to provide food aid to North Korea if the communist country officially asks for it . <p> The North , admitting for the first time that it faced a food crisis , asked Japan last month for emergency food supplies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> But North Korea has not officially responded to the South Korean offer , apparently out of national pride . <p> " We are ready to give food aid to North Korea if it agrees to discuss it officially , " Kim told a meeting of senior citizens from what is now North Korea . Millions of people crossed the border during the 1950-53 Korean War to live in the South . <p> There have been unconfirmed reports that North Korea , in unofficial contacts with South Korean officials , has expressed willingness to receive food aid through the Red Cross or other non-governmental channels . <p> South Korea , fearing that its food aid might be diverted to the military , insisted that any food aid be given through official channels . <p> Experts in Seoul say the North 's food problem is chronic and the country is short about 2.5 million tons a year to feed its 22 million people . <p> With its economy in tatters , the North reportedly has little cash to buy food from outside . <p> A schoolteacher suspected of killing 22 children he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kidnapping and murder of a 10-year-old boy . <p> Norman Simons , dubbed the " Station Strangler " in one of South Africa 's worst serial murder cases , rubbed his eyes and moaned when Judge Wallie van Deventer read the verdict . A maximum penalty of life imprisonment could be delivered Tuesday . <p> Simons , 27 , described by his colleagues as quiet and popular with students , was charged only with the murder of Elroy van Rooyen but was widely believed by police and public to be the serial killer who left a trail of 22 corpses over eight years . <p> The victims were young boys and teen-agers lured away from train stations in the poor , mixed-race Cape Flats area Cape Town . They typically were raped and strangled . <p> Van Rooyen went missing last March after a man he met at a games shop convinced him to carry some boxes to a train station . He was later found face down in a shallow grave with his hands tied behind his back . <p> The court cleared Simons , described by colleagues as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rooyen , saying tests on semen taken from the boy 's body had proven inconclusive . <p> Van Deventer did not find Simons guilty of sodomizing van Rooyen because tests done on semen that was found on the child 's body were inconclusive . <p> But van Deventer said the evidence left no doubt he was the killer . <p> Simons , who suffers a personality disorder , had confessed after his arrest last April that he had been sodomized as a child by his brother and since heard voices telling him to kill people . <p> The next day he retracted the confession , but subsequently told police that he met van Rooyen at the games shop and took officers to the nearby train station where he molested and killed the boy . <p> Ten-year-old Ryno van Rooi , who was with van Rooyen at the games shop , told the court they were approached outside by a man who offered them money to help him carry boxes . Van Rooyen left with the man for the train station and was never seen alive again . <p> ( az-pm ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ice cream caught Solomon Sikakane 's entrepreneurial eye . <p> " These little chaps , these are our clients , " Sikakane said . <p> Sikakane and partner Barbara Malk are pioneers : They are opening a bookstore in South Africa 's largest black township .

None of South Africa 's major bookstore chains had ventured into Soweto when the upscale mall opened last year . <p> The township south of Johannesburg was built as little more than a vast dormitory for black workers . Little thought was given to providing conveniences like shopping malls , movie theaters or bookstores . <p> That is beginning to change with the end of apartheid and South Africa 's first all-race vote last year .

That 's due in part to apartheid-era education meant to keep blacks in menial jobs . Schools , viewed as instruments of the white minority government 's schemes , were the targets of anti-apartheid protesters who shouted " liberation before education .
