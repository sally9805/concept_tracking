Fearing for the safety of their grandchildren , Joellene Adams and her husband left the barricade and drove into enemy territory . But as they pulled up to the home of their son Richard , he fired an automatic rifle at the car . Later that evening Richard telephoned with an apology : " Ma , I 'm sorry . I did n't know it was you . " Replied his mother : " Do n't ever call me Ma again . " <P> Over the past year such violent Mohawk vs . Mohawk clashes have become commonplace on the 28,000-acre St. Regis reservation , as a bitter quarrel over lucrative casino operations has escalated into a virtual civil war . Heavily armed pro- and antigambling factions have battled for control of the main road through the reservation , which straddles the border between upstate New York and Canada 's Quebec and Ontario provinces . Last week the fighting reached a new and bloody peak : thousands of shots were exchanged in a three-hour gun battle that left two dead . Hundreds of New York State troopers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-governing reservation , and a force of Canadian police moved in to restore an uneasy calm . <P> More is at stake than the gambling industry , with revenues of as much as $300 million , which has flourished on the U.S. side of the reservation since bingo parlors were introduced in 1986 as a quick and easy way to fund tribal welfare programs . " It 's a question of who is going to have jurisdiction and under what conditions " over every aspect of reservation life , says Ron LaFrance , acting director of the American Indian Program at Cornell University . A bitter power struggle between three competing tribal councils has been exacerbated by disagreements among a maze of U.S. and Canadian government agencies that oversee the reservation . <P> Mohawks who live on the Canadian side enjoy less autonomy than their American counterparts . Their only attempt to launch a bingo operation was quickly shut down in 1984 by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police . The casinos on the U.S. side are also illegal . But that has not kept thousands of gamblers from both sides of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tables at six gaudy gambling palaces . Since last June , federal and state law- enforcement officials have repeatedly raided casinos , confiscated cash and removed slot machines in an attempt to keep gambling within legal bounds . But a shutdown would require continuous police presence , a provocative move U.S. officials have not been ready to make . <P> Although the crackdown has drawn applause from antigambling Mohawk factions , it has provoked a militant response from Mohawks who regard the raids as violations of the tribe 's sovereign rights . " We need to exercise our right to self-determination , " argues Francis Boots , spokesman for the Mohawk Warriors Society , a militant and well-armed vigilante group that favors the casinos . " Gambling is just a small part of that . "
