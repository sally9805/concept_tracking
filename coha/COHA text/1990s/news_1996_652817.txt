<p> Diana Trilling , an uncompromising cultural and social critic and a member of the circle of writers , thinkers and polemicists of the 1930 's , 40 's and 50 's known as the New York intellectuals , died on Wednesday at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital . She was 91 and lived in Manhattan . <p> At one point , as a critic for The Nation , Mrs. Trilling read a novel a day for six and a half years , delivering challenging reviews on some of the most important works of the modern era : Evelyn Waugh 's " Brideshead Revisited , " Robert Penn Warren 's " All the King 's Men , " Jean-Paul Sartre 's " Age of Reason " and George Orwell 's " 1984 . " <p> As a reviewer , she approached her work with " force , control and precision , " said Paul Fussell , the scholar and author , in his introduction to a collection of her criticism titled " Reviewing the Forties " ( Harcourt Brace , 1978 ) . Her theme , he said , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentimentalities to fiction . " Above all , he said , she was " impatient with simplicities , " but " generous in recognizing real merit . " <p> As an intellectual living through the Depression , the rise and fall of Fascism and Communism , World War II , the Holocaust , Prohibition and the sexual revolution , Diana Trilling clung to an old-fashioned ethos . <p> " My first responsibility was to my home and family , " she once said . " I was able to deceive myself that it was a matter of free will and competence that I took on the tasks of the home . " She credited her husband , Lionel Trilling  --  one of the century 's foremost literary critics and teachers and the author of works like " The Liberal Imagination " that became central documents of American intellectual life  --  with her success and development as a critical writer , even as she struggled to establish herself in her own right in later years . <p> Keeping the Flame , While Breaking Free <p> To everyone , she was a complicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for cultural contention and a sharp , usually unforgiving pen . Robert Lowell called her " a housekeeping goddess of reason . " <p> She began writing in 1941 and never stopped . Fifty-four years later , in her 90th year , with failing eyesight , she composed a 75-page article on the Welsh literary figure Goronwey Rees , offered it for publication to The New Yorker , then headed for her summer home on Cape Cod . Later , back in her ground-floor apartment on Claremont Avenue near Columbia University , she resumed her routine of writing from 9 in the morning to 1 in the afternoon , five days a week . <p> She believed that " writers are what they write , also what they fail to write . " No novels , no volumes of poetry or short fiction bear her name , but among her credits are five books . These include three collections of essays and reviews and an impressionistic piece of journalism , " Mrs. Harris : The Death of the Scarsdale Diet Doctor " ( Harcourt Brace , 1981 ) , about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an exclusive girls ' school , for the murder of her lover . She also wrote " The Beginning of the Journey " ( Harcourt Brace , 1993 ) , sometimes a memoir , sometimes an apologia , often a long letter of rebuke to those who thought of her as little more than a sidekick to the scholar with whom she lived for 46 years . <p> Still , the task of keeping Lionel Trilling 's flame while trying to break free of its light sometimes seemed to envelop her . She once told an interviewer that the headline on her obituary would read : " Diana Trilling Dies at 150 . Widow of Distinguished Professor and Literary Critic Lionel Trilling . " <p> His expertise was acquired ; he held a doctorate from Columbia University , taught there in the company of brilliant colleagues and challenged students who went on to produce some of the country 's finest literature and criticism . Her expertise , on the other hand , was intuitive ; her Radcliffe degree in fine arts , she said , left her ill-prepared for anything except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I graduated from Radcliffe without having read a line of Homer or Dante or Chaucer , without knowing anything of Shakespeare , " she said . So she learned from her husband , " casually , unconsciously , by association , " and along the way discovered that she had a natural acuity for language and an innate sense of what made a good book work . <p> She suggested in her memoir that Lionel Trilling often used her as an editor and tutor on style . " What I was trying to bring to his writing was a greater directness and greater fluidity , " she wrote . Nevertheless , she never doubted " that , of the two of us , he was the more important writer . " Her husband " had more to say than I and a great deal more resonated from what he wrote . " <p> Her work appeared in some of the best magazines in the country , including The New Yorker , The Atlantic , Harper 's and The Saturday Review , but mainly in two journals that were among those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , The Nation , where she wrote book reviews and literary criticism , and The Partisan Review , to which she contributed essays . Her writing bears out her interest in the relationship between esthetics , morality and society and her determination to express moral judgments  --  her critics said moralistic judgments  --  on literature and the political issues of the day . <p> She was a fierce anti-Communist , someone who joined some Communist-front groups in the early 1930 's but who then became disaffected by the ruthlessness of Stalin , and for the rest of her public life she wore the ideals of Western democracy on her sleeve . Perhaps it was this disaffection that led her to think of herself as a rationalist bent on exposing empty slogans and ideas  --  political , literary and cultural . And it was this stance , the immovable anti-Communist who insisted that all ideas be grounded in rationality and morality , that dominated her work . <p> ' An Anxious World ' Filled With Fears <p> A native New Yorker , she was born on July 21 , 1905 , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a manufacturer of straw braid . Her parents were immigrant Polish Jews who moved with their children from Westchester to Brooklyn to Manhattan . " Pleasure was not the principle of our home , " Mrs. Trilling once wrote . " I learned early in life that to laugh before breakfast was to cry before dinner . " <p> She described herself as an " excessively fearful " child . First she was afraid of the dark , then of burglars and , as she grew older , eventually of just about everything , especially being alone or leaving the house . " I regard the whole of my life as having been lived in an anxious world , " she said . <p> Her fears , indeed her fear of having so many fears , may have shaped her choice of work , she came to believe , because they made her " too intent upon reasonableness " and " blocked the free play of my imagination . " Thus she stuck to analytical writing , preferring the logical and cerebral to the fantastic . <p> In 1927 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bullfrog ( gin , apricot brandy and grenadine )  --  she met Lionel Trilling . He was smart and handsome , a graduate student in literature at Columbia . In a short time , they fell in love . Later they slept together . ( " Surely going to bed with a man before marriage was the most courageous act of my life , " she said . ) And in 1929 , they were married . <p> " With marriage I had entered Lionel 's world , " she said . " It was with his friends that I now chiefly associated . They were not easy companions , these intellectuals . They were overbearing and arrogant , excessively competitive ; they lacked magnanimity and often they lacked common courtesy . Ours was a cruelly judgmental society , often malicious and riddled with envy .

" In the pages of The Partisan Review , Commentary , The Nation and Dissent , they debated whether America should enter World War II . They quarreled over Trotsky and Senator Joseph R. McCarthy , the Beats and the Columbia riots to such an extent that many of the survivors have not spoken to one another for years . <p> When these intellectuals were not preoccupied by ideas or pulling apart the culture , they talked incessantly , Mrs. Trilling remembered in her memoir , " about sex , sex , and more sex , with particular emphasis upon adultery . " Sex , she continued , " took up as much conversational space as in later years we would give to politics .

When her husband hung up , Mrs. Trilling looked at him and offered herself for the position . <p> She held the job for 10 years , often wielding her pen like a Bowie knife : " A mad , bad , and dangerous book , Allan Seager 's ' Equinox ' is fiction 's most recent attempt to practice psychiatry without a license . " Or , of Truman Capote 's " Other Voices , Other Rooms " : " I find myself deeply antipathetic to the whole artistic-moral purpose of Mr. Capote 's novel . I would freely trade 80 percent of his technical skill for 20 percent more value in the uses to which it is put . " <p> She was proud of her reputation as a clear-eyed , uncompromising critic . She liked to tell the story of a Viennese novelist , a refugee from Nazi Austria , who " was said to have remarked that he had lost his country , his home , his language , but that he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reviewed by me . " <p> As she approached her 42d birthday , she decided that she and her husband had been squandering their lives . " We were afraid to be full grown up and to be in command of ourselves and others . " And so she became pregnant . Their only child , James , was born shortly thereafter , in 1947 . James , of Providence , R.I. , survives her , as do two grandchildren . <p> In 1975 , Lionel Trilling died of pancreatic cancer at the age of 70 , and in the years that followed , she worked hard to assure his legacy , editing a 12-volume uniform edition of his work . But she also strove successfully to establish her own mark , writing essays , publishing two collections of criticism  --  " Reviewing the Forties " and " We Must My Darlings " ( Harcourt Brace , 1977 )  --  and covering the Jean Harris trial .

" She said that the best academic minds had drifted into esoteric specialization and she assailed multiculturalism as " our present-day version of Stalinism  --  a culture of moral virtue without thought .
