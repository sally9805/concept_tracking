<p> Although Jack Pardee may get a crick in his neck from looking over his shoulder at Buddy Ryan , Oilers owner Bud Adams insists the head coach 's job is not in jeopardy . <p> Adams and general manager Mike Holovak hired Ryan as defensive coordinator , but that does n't mean he is the heir apparent to Pardee . <p> " " Jack 's not on the hot seat , " Adams said Monday . " " He 's a laid-back guy who does n't jump up and down . I want him to be more of a take-charge guy , and I think he will be . <p> " " I like Buddy , and the public seems to like us having Buddy , but I have n't seen him coach yet . I 've got to look at him the first year . " <p> In his annual state-of-the-Oilers address , Adams spent more than an hour discussing such subjects as Pardee 's job security , Ryan 's hiring , the Wilber Marshall controversy , defensive tackle Ray Childress ' contract situation , adding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the NFL and the owner 's wish for his team to reach the Super Bowl before he dies . <p> One subject that is going to be an almost endless source of speculation before and during the season is Pardee 's job security and Ryan 's eagerness to become a head coach again . <p> " " Jack gives his coordinators a lot of authority , and I ca n't think of anybody I 'd rather have running our defense than Buddy Ryan , " Adams said . " " Buddy wants to be a head coach again and probably will be when there 's a window of opportunity . " <p> Adams has more pressing problems than the head coach 's job security . Once again , he gave out mixed signals on Marshall , saying the trade was dead but not ruling out acquiring the Washington Redskins ' franchise player . <p> The Redskins are hoping commissioner Paul Tagliabue will force the Oilers to give them first- and fifth-round picks for the linebacker , a deal agreed upon by the teams before the Oilers pulled it off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington on Monday signed outside linebacker Carl Banks , who was waived by the New York Giants earlier in the day . Banks and Marshall play the same position . <p> " " I do n't think anything 's going to happen , " Adams said . <p> " " We 've already said what we 're going to do . We never had a trade with them . " <p> The Redskins and Marshall 's agent , Richard Bennett , say the trade should be completed because the linebacker agreed with the Oilers on a one-year contract for $ 2.75 million . But Adams had instructed team general counsel Steve Underwood to pull the plug on the deal before Marshall accepted . <p> " " I did n't change my mind , " Adams said . " " I was not for the price or the No. 1 and 5 picks . Until you make your trade in writing to the commissioner , it 's not official . We never notified the league , and neither did the Redskins . <p> " " Now I 'd be interested if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sixth-round draft choice . " <p> Asked if he believes there is any way Marshall might still wind up with the Oilers , Adams said , " " I do , but I 'm not going to talk about it here . We 're not pursuing it right now ; I do n't want to mislead you . We have until the sixth game of the season ( the NFL trading deadline ) to make a trade . " Reminded that Ryan guaranteed a Super Bowl victory if the Oilers acquired Marshall , Adams said , " " I do n't think there 's any one man who 's going to take us to the Super Bowl . It 's going to take a team effort . <p> " " Marshall would be a great addition . They ( Bennett and Marshall ) said we could n't name him the franchise player , so how long were we going to get him ? One year . You 're giving up an awful lot for one year if we gave them what they wanted . " Since Adams says Marshall is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he plans to turn his attention to Childress . The Pro Bowl defensive tackle has one year left on his contract at $ 970,000 , including a $ 120,000 reporting bonus . He has vowed not to play until he gets a new deal . <p> Childress said the Oilers promised to redo his contract last year . There were negotiations between Underwood and agent Jeff Moorad , who is Leigh Steinberg 's partner , at the owners meeting in March , but nothing came of it . Childress was placed on a back burner . <p> " " We 're going to do what we said we 're going to do , " Adams said . " " We 'll be getting an offer to Childress . A lot of things have happened since we started on that situation . <p> " " We made a deal with Warren Moon in July ( announced in early September ) , and he did n't sign the contract until December . I told him ( Steinberg ) we were not going to start negotiating with Childress until he signed off on Moon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " " We 're going to be talking to Childress and Steinberg . We 've got a good relationship with them . We 'll be talking to Leigh within the next two weeks . " <p> Adams also addressed the issue of adding a tight end to the roster . Adams and Holovak wanted a tight end . The coaches did n't , nor did Moon , who has been outspoken on the subject . <p> " " How many teams have tight ends ? " Adams said . <p> " " Twenty-seven . Why do we need one ? I 'm not the coach , but they could do some things with the tight end that would make the defense have a harder time trying to figure out what the hell they 're doing . <p> " " Right now , we line up the same way . Our slot guy goes in motion . Every team almost knows where our receivers are going to end up . We have to do something to make those defensive coaches work harder . <p> " " We 've got a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> John Henry Mills , the fifth-round pick , is a 6-foot , 220-pound tight end who is more suited for H-back . <p> " " He 's tough , and he can catch , " Adams said . " " He wo n't be an All-Pro tight end , but we wo n't be using him like that . I do n't know how they 'll be using him , but he 'll play special teams , I guarantee you that . " <p> Adams does not think the Oilers need to use a tight end to reach the Super Bowl , but since he is 70 , he believes the team should pursue every method possible to give them their best opportunity . <p> " " I 'm in pretty good health , but I do n't want to wait too much longer , " Adams said . " " I want to get there as quick as I can . <p> " " We have the fifth-best won-lost record over the last five years . We 're the only team that 's made the playoffs the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the playoffs . We have a winning team ; you ca n't knock that . <p> " " If you go by stats , we 're ranked right up near the top in offense and defense . We have n't been able to get to the division championship , but you ca n't say what we 're doing is all wrong . <p> " " Teams around the league say we have the best talent , and I give Mike Holovak full credit for that , but we have n't put it together to get the final results we want . We 're a better team than Buffalo was last year , but they were in the Super Bowl and we were n't . " <p> Adams is happy the Oilers lost only two unrestricted free agents  --  offensive tackle Don Maggs ( to Denver ) and outside linebacker Rick Graf ( Washington ) . But the Oilers and Dallas are the only teams that have not signed free agents under the new system , and the Cowboys are severely restricted under the new rules because they won the Super Bowl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than us , " he said . " " New England did n't lose any . <p> " " Some people say you did n't sign any free agents , but our theory behind that was we were n't going to sign some player just to be signing him . Why sign a guy who 's making more than a starter and ca n't beat him out ? There were few free agents who could have come in and beat out our players . " <p> Adams is concerned about the salary cap that is projected to take effect in 1994 . Projections are that clubs will be able to spend between $ 32 million and $ 34 million on player salaries . <p> " " If we started the 1994 season tomorrow , we 'd be $ 10 million over the cap , " Adams said . " " I 'm including our three transition players ( Ernest Givins , Lorenzo White and Al Smith ) we tendered offers to today . <p> " " We have 13 starters whose contracts are going to be up this year ( nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are All-Pros . We 've got 16 non-starters whose contracts will be up . <p> That 's 29 players . You tell me how we 're going to do it . " <p> Adams speaks out <p> On the breakdown at Buffalo : " " I do n't blame the defense completely because the offense stunk the second half . Coaching decisions were bad . We did n't even handle the clock . That 's going to be a hard one for us to overcome <p> That was probably the most disappointing , devastating day in my whole football career . " <p> On outside linebacker Lamar Lathon being demoted to second-team : " " Lathon should have been here when we had the rookies and free agents ( minicamp ) instead of on some cruise . I think he would have learned a little more on the field than he did on the cruise . He 's going to have to play football and do it right to play for Buddy Ryan . " <p> On dissension among the players , primarily over money : " " We 're no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Houston tomorrow if they could change places with guys here because they like the run-and-shoot offense . Some of our players could n't play on another team that has two wideouts . I do n't think Curtis Duncan could start for another team that uses two wideouts . He does n't have enough speed . " <p> On the run-and-shoot offense : " " Everyone 's used to playing the run-and-shoot . If we brought in a coach who wanted to use a New York Giants-type offense , it would be a disaster for three or four years and reverse everything we 've been doing for the last few years . "
