It had never happened before in the history of aviation . The chances of its happening again are one in a number that has zeros stacked across the page like eggs in cold storage . And yet the fact remains that it happened . For a long time , people who saw it will tell their children and grandchildren how Shorty Frooze , who had never flown an airplane , found himself suddenly at the controls of an airliner 8,000 feet up in the blue air over Kansas , and how , like a farm boy breaking the new colt , he calmly decided to ride the big ship in to a landing . <p> But to appreciate what really happened that July afternoon you have to know something about Shorty . His real name was n't Frooze , of course . It was Habib el Something or Other , one of those Asia Minor names that are like nothing in English . They began to call him Frooze in the years when he was a fruit peddler in a little town near Kansas City . I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , jingling a bell , and singing his wares in a high voice that penetrated every kitchen in town . " Can'aloupe ! " he would call . " Wa'ermelon ! Fresh Frooze ! " And the name stuck , even when he learned to say " fruits " and retired the patient little donkey and set up a sidewalk stand in Kansas City  --  Shorty Frooze . <p> The most important thing about Shorty was his son . Had you ever guessed Bill James was his boy ? Bill dropped his last name when he went to the University of Kansas . He was as different from his father as could be . He was big and handsome and popular , and a great athlete . Shorty told me once that Bill resembled his mother , who died when Bill was born . And inevitably Shorty 's boy grew away from nervous little Shorty , who could n't even talk plain English . Bill was n't exactly ashamed of his father , but when he took him to father-and-son banquets in high school , Shorty did n't enjoy it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thereafter Shorty faded into the background . He stayed away from Bill 's fraternity house in Lawrence . Whenever Bill played ball I would see Shorty there , with a happy mist in his eyes , but always in some inconspicuous corner , and I could never find him when the game was over . <p> One big area of Bill 's world was closed to Shorty . That was aviation . Bill was a natural flier . He soloed at 17 . By the time he was 18 , they said , he could fly a barn door if anyone would put an electric fan on it . He went to the airlines before he finished Kansas . When the shooting started in Europe he wanted to go right into the RAF , but Shorty said no . He said Bill was all he had left . Wait at least long enough to finish out the year with the airlines , he pleaded . Because Bill was n't quite 21 , Shorty had to give consent . They said some pretty bitter words before Bill stomped out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the accident , barely a week later , with Shorty watching . <p> Shorty grieved unnaturally over Bill 's death . He kept blaming himself , torturing himself . I always passed his little stand on my way to work , and for days at a time it would be closed , while Shorty sat at home grieving . Then he took to hanging around the airport , talking to the mechanics and the pilots and watching the ships slide in from every point on the compass . They knew why he did it ; he felt closer to Bill there . But after a while he became a nuisance , and they had to ask him to stay away . <p> Then he went back to work again , frantically . I could find him at the stand any hour of the day or evening . To save money he went often without food , as he had when he was helping put Bill through Lawrence . And whenever he had a few dollars saved up he took an airplane trip . He would come to the airport hours before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their hands . The first time I saw him there , I stared , too . I did n't know him . He had got out his Sunday suit , and it must have been the suit he was married in . It had tight trousers and a long coat and made him look like something out of a musical comedy . But when the plane was announced Shorty was always first in line , and he would scurry out to be sure of the front seat . That was as near as possible to the place where Bill had sat when he was pilot ; there Shorty could see as nearly as possible what Bill must have seen from the pilot 's cockpit . It would have seemed pitiful , his trying so hard to get closer to the boy in death than he could in life , if it had n't been laughable . And that was how Shorty happened to be on the front seat of an airliner bound from Denver to Kansas City on the July day when it happened . <p> The other passengers confirm Shorty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Denver toward Kansas City when the stewardess opened the door of the pilots ' compartment and stepped into the passengers ' part of the ship . She was as white as her blouse , they said . She sat down unsteadily beside Shorty in the front seat . Apparently only Shorty heard what she said . She pointed to the front compartment . <p> " My God , see what 's in there ! " she gasped , and fainted dead away . <p> Shorty himself did n't know exactly why he did what he did in the next few minutes . Why he took the stewardess 's keys and went into the pilots ' compartment , instead of giving the stewardess first aid , is something that could be explained only in terms of some larger pattern of which that act was a part . The important thing is that he did go through the door forbidden to passengers . He locked the door behind him and looked along the passageway , which he had never seen but which Bill had seen so often , past the radio equipment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pilot and copilot sit surrounded by windows and instruments . <p> At first he comprehended only that there was something vaguely wrong with what he saw . It came to him slowly that there was no pilot and no copilot , and no hand was on the controls , and no eye was watching where the ship flew . <p> Still slowly , like a man lifting an unknown weight , he mastered other details : one pilot stretched out on the floor , the other slumped down behind his seat . Shorty touched them , fearing he might be touching dead men . He listened to their hearts . He propped them up , then stretched them out and poured water from a vacuum bottle on their faces . You have read the story in the newspapers , of course , and you know that pilots and stewardesses were suffering from a violent attack of food poisoning , from a lunch they had eaten before flight . But Shorty did not know that . He knew only that both pilots were unconscious , and he could not revive them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plane high above Kansas . <p> The sensible thing , he admitted to himself , would be to go back and see whether a doctor or a pilot was among the passengers . He tried to weigh the possibility of there being a doctor or a pilot against the possibility of panic if there was none . And partly because of that judgment , partly because he was at last where Bill had sat on so many flights , he decided not to go back to the passengers  --  not for a little while . <p> He sat down in the pilot 's seat , trembling , but not with fright . This thing with the little steering wheel on the end must be the " stick " Bill had mentioned so often . There was one for each pilot , and two pedals like clutch and brake in front of each stick . He tried to see how many of the dials and switches on the instrument panel he could identify from hearing Bill talk about them . One he was sure of  --  down at the lower left center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was what was keeping the plane level and straight . Things would be all right until the gas gave out . Here was the radio headset . Acting on a sentimental little impulse , he put on the earphones and picked up the microphone Bill must have addressed so often . <p> Bill would have said something professional like " Pilot to tower , " he knew , and given the flight number and position . But the only thing Shorty could think of to say , in a high , embarrassed voice , was , " Hello there . Hello , Kansas City . " <p> Nothing happened for a minute , and then a voice came into his earphones . He felt like a boy caught playing with forbidden toys . But the voice was calm and matter-of-fact . " Hello , old fellow , " it said . " Been wondering where you were . Anything wrong ? " <p> Shorty thought at the time that the voice would be engraved in his memory like chisel cuts in stone , but later he had trouble describing it for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , of course , and it was like any other airways voice  --  flat , calm , sparing of words , the kind of rhythm men develop from dealing much with elements and refusing to get excited over mere man-made things . All afternoon Shorty kept trying to identify it with some person he knew , but not quite succeeding . It was a friendly voice , for all its impersonal quality . It invited confidence . And before Shorty really thought about what he was doing , he was pouring the whole story of his situation into the microphone . <p> When he stopped , there was a long , low whistle from the earphones . <p> " My kid Bill ought to be here , " said Shorty . " He was a flier . " <p> " Yes . I know , " said the voice . Then it was silent so long that Shorty said anxiously , " Hello ? " <p> " Well , " said the voice thoughtfully . It took a long time to say , " Well . " <p> " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If I were you , " said the voice , " I 'd fly her into Kansas City . " <p> " But I do n't know how , " said Shorty . <p> " I 'll teach you , " said the voice . <p> " You 'll do what ? " gasped Shorty . <p> " Put your hands on the stick and your feet on the pedals , " said the voice . " Do n't be afraid . They wo n't bite . " <p> Shorty swore to me that is what happened up in the plane . That is how he came to do what he did . He says he did n't feel frightened at first ; he felt foolish , like a man on a quiz program . Then he wondered how soon he would wake up . It took a long time , Shorty said , before the reality of the situation swung around in his mind and hit him like a fist . <p> And by that time the voice in his earphones had taken over and was n't giving him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scared of the instrument board , either , " said the voice . " You wo n't need most of the things on it . They 're luxuries . See if you can find a dial marked Altimeter and tell me what it says . " <p> " Eight , " said Shorty . <p> " That means 8,000 feet , " said the voice . " Now look for a handle marked Automatic Pilot . " <p> " Here it is , " said Shorty . <p> " Turn it to ' off . ' " <p> " Take off the Automatic Pilot ? " gasped Shorty . <p> " Sure , " said the voice . " You 're going to learn to fly this crate , are n't you ? " <p> Shorty 's hand shook as he took off the Automatic Pilot . The left wing dropped slightly . <p> " Keep the stick center . " <p> The wing went up . <p> " How did you know ? " asked Shorty incredulously . <p> " Everybody does it the first time , " chuckled the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Landing 's simple , but you 'll have to know how to bank . Let 's try ' a left bank first . Put the stick a little left and a little forward . Push the left pedal a little . Just a little . " <p> Bill had talked about that , Shorty remembered . He had said that the pedals worked just the opposite of a bobsled crossbar . <p> The big ship came around . Shorty took one hand off the stick and wiped something wet out of his eyes . In that instant he understood more of what flying had meant to Bill than ever before . <p> " Level it off , " said the voice . " Press the right pedal a little . Stick back to center . Pull it back a little to put the nose up . How was it ? " <p> " A little jerky , " said Shorty . <p> " You probably lost some altitude , too , " said the voice . " That 's because you did n't keep your nose on the horizon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " The plane 's nose . Now let 's try another left bank . " The voice seemed to hypnotize him into it . Shorty said . " Now another . " it said . " Better ? ... You know , " said the voice . " you might fool me and come in on the other side . Let 's try a right bank . Just the opposite . Right pedal , and so on . Come on , now ; let 's do it . " <p> " That was pretty bad , " said Shorty . I remember , Bill said a right bank seemed harder than a left one at first . " <p> " That 's right . Now let 's practice another one . " <p> " What do you suppose the passengers think ? " asked Shorty . <p> " What they do n't know wo n't hurt them . Are you flying along the railroad tracks now ? " <p> " Pretty close . " <p> " East or west ? Look at your compass . Top of the instrument board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How are you at glides ? " <p> " I never tried one , " said Shorty . <p> " Better try two or three . About all there is to landing is a good long glide . Push the wheel a little forward and try one . Not too far forward . What does the altimeter say now ? " <p> " Seven and a half . Does that mean 7,500 ? " <p> " Yes , " said the voice . " Now look around and find the switch that lowers the wheels . You 'll need that . " <p> Shorty said he surrendered himself to the voice like a man floating downstream . What it told him to practice , he practiced . What it told him to push and pull and press , he did . Once there was a prolonged pounding on the door behind him . " Shall I open the door ? " he asked the microphone . <p> " I would n't , " said the voice in the earphones . " Why take a chance ? You can fly this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> That was one of the sweetest moments in Shorty 's life . <p> " They told me I was too old to learn to fly , " he confessed . " They even kicked me out of the Kansas City airport . " <p> " They wo n't today , " said the voice . <p> Shorty said he wished he had a 50 cent cigar . That was the first moment in his life when he had felt like smoking one . <p> As they flew on across Kansas , Shorty said he got a kind of physical pleasure out of living he had n't experienced for 30 years . His senses seemed peculiarly alert to the blueness of the air above him , the sweep of the Kansas plain , the wind waves in the wheat , and prairie grass below him . He saw another plane , headed southwest along the distant horizon , and felt the warm sense of brotherhood that ships feel at sea . Bill had told him about that feeling , but he had n't understood it . <p> He even began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever felt with anyone except Bill , when Bill was a boy . With his customers , with the few neighbors he knew , he always tried to say as little as possible and to cover up his awkward English and his funny accent . This fellow talking into his earphones actually seemed to want to hear him talk . Shorty told him about himself , and about Bill , and about some of the things he could see from the plane . When he saw what looked like wheel tracks curving across the prairie , it was the most natural thing on earth to ask the voice what they were . <p> " That 's the old Santa Fe Trail , " Shorty 's earphones said . " That 's the road they took before there were railroads . They went to the old Spanish cities in Mexico and brought wagonloads of goods home to sell . That 's one of the most famous roads in America . " <p> " Why , that 's what I do , " said Shorty , becoming excited . " That 's how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bring it up here to sell . I used to sell it in wagons , too . Can'aloupes and wa'ermelons and frooze . " Unconsciously he dropped back into the old immigrant English . <p> " Sure , " said the voice . <p> Impulsively , Shorty told about the quarrel with Bill and how sorry he was that Bill 's last words had been spoken in anger . <p> " I do n't think Bill held any anger at you , " said the voice . <p> " How well did you know Bill ? " asked Shorty . <p> " Pretty well . " There was a little silence , and then the voice asked , " How do you feel , old fellow ? " <p> Over to the north was the yellow River Kaw , and the Lawrence hill was rising out of the endless plain . The hill , crowned by shining university buildings , had always seemed very high and insurmountable to Shorty . From this angle it looked different . <p> " You 're going to take her down now , old fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make a good landing . Your kid Bill would be proud of you . " <p> Shorty said that was the last time he felt any indecision about it . <p> " Better start to lose altitude now . Take her down to 2,000 . Slow . Plenty of time . Slow ... slow . " <p> Shorty pushed the stick forward ... slow ... slow . <p> The smoke of Kansas City was on the sky , and the taller buildings were beginning to separate from the horizon . When Shorty first saw the field he wondered how a plane could hit anything so small , but when he approached it a second time with motors throttled down as far as they would go , landing flaps down , wheels reaching for the ground , he felt a great surge of strength and knew he could do it . He banked around , feeling all the firmness and power of the ship as it turned into the wind . A sea captain 's phrase went through his memory  --  " a taut ship "  --  and he knew suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he understood something else about flying : You fly , the plane does n't . Or at least there is a time of merger when you and the plane become one and fly . He wondered how often Bill had felt this same oneness with his plane . He felt very near to Bill at that moment , perhaps closer than ever in life . It was almost as though he and Bill were one . <p> Then he was steering into the white stripe of the runway , pulling back the stick little by little as the voice in the earphones told him to , cutting the airspeed , trying to bring the tail down level with the nose , trying to hold the wings level , knowing that the next ten seconds would tell whether it was a good landing or a crash . <p> Even in those seconds he remembered a plane he had once seen overrun a field and stand awkwardly , with nose buried in a swamp and tail high in the air , until everything above the ground burned away . Bill 's plane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left one hit first  --  left wing low , he guessed  --  and the plane gave a great awkward bounce , turned a little off the runway , and settled down . Shorty cut the ignition and let the ship roll . He did n't feel up to taxiing it . After it stopped rolling , he put his head down on the stick and closed his eyes . <p> When the field attendants rushed out in their little cars to bawl him out for not taxiing to the landing apron , his first impulse was to crouch down , so they would n't see him , or try to vanish in the crowd before anybody saw who he was . Then he remembered some things that had happened during the afternoon , and he sat up straight . <p> The attendants saw his civilian coat in the window and stopped growling and were silent in astonishment . And then he had his little moment of triumph . Little Shorty Frooze who sold cantaloupes . Little Shorty who was kicked off the airport because he was a nuisance . He sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaned out the window and spoke to them in what he imagined to be the authoritative voice of an airlines captain . <p> " We have sick men aboard , " he said . " Take care of them before you touch anything else in the plane . " <p> And that is all of Shorty 's story except one very important incident . When they had shaken his hand and snapped his picture , he said he wanted to go to the tower to thank the person who had helped him bring in the ship . They laughed at the joke , and then saw he was in earnest . <p> The airport manager took him aside a moment . " Mr.  --  er  --  Frooze , " he said , " you know , do n't you , that we 've been trying to contact your plane all afternoon ? Nobody in the tower has been talking to you . " <p> Well , you explain it . What happened in the blue air over Kansas I have told you just as Shorty told me . It does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the other hand , it does n't seem possible that he could have remembered enough from Bill 's old aviation chatter to bring in that plane without help . Shorty swears someone was talking to him , and he thinks he knows who it was . I do n't for a moment believe it was who he thinks it was , but strange things happen . And the important thing , after all , is what Shorty thinks , because he has stopped grieving over Bill now , and walks with his head up , and does n't hide from people , and looks at the sky with the squint of a flier . <p>
