The Bighorns float above the haze to the west of our ranch like marble palaces in a fairy tale . Until the woman came , we 'd never been up in those mountains . My father kept us to work day after day , or else there was school , and , until the woman , he 'd said he could n't leave the ranch for that long , especially not at lambing time . <p> My father always knows when the lambs are coming . Some years they come early , when the snow slaps into your face like a horse 's tail . Then some of them die . Sometimes they come late and the house gets heavy with our waiting . This year the ewes were on time . All the snow was gone , except on the Bighorn Mountains , which are always covered with snow . <p> When my mother died a few years ago , Ben was just starting to talk and I got him all worked up over going up into the Bighorns . It gave us something to want . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us busy and he was n't talking much . <p> I take good care of Ben : fold his clothes and put them away , draw his bath , watch over him when my father is working the ranch or down to Bucky 's . I do most of the cooking . When I put on lipstick and nail polish my father does n't mind , even though my mother would have said I 'm still too young . Every night I roll up my hair in curlers just the way my mother used to . At first I missed her so bad I had to press a pillow against my stomach in order to sleep . Sometimes now , I ca n't quite remember what she looked like . <p> The three-wheeler turned over on my father last summer . He was chasing the cows into the close-in pasture , and he broke his leg in three places . He limps now , and I can hear him at night moving around the kitchen when he ca n't sleep . The uneven sound of it makes me sad . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found him . When the men carried him in , he had passed out from the pain and I thought at first he was dead . In the front room we have a sofa . Above it is a picture of Jesus that shimmers rays of light when you move to the side of it . They laid him down underneath Jesus until a neighbor came in a station wagon to take him to the hospital in Sheridan . He came to while we were waiting and he squeezed my hand and said , " Little Mother . " <p> His hair is black and falls over his eyes . I like to push it back and then run my fingers down to his scratchy chin . I like the red dust on his shoulders , the cuffs of his jeans that trap little pieces of hay . I like everything about him . <p> Maybe once a week my father drives us down Route 6 to Bucky 's and buys us sandwiches that Bucky keeps in a freezer and heats in a microwave . My father drinks beer , sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , getting in the way of the game . Dogs wander in and out . Neighbor women stop in on their way home from jobs in Sheridan . We know everyone there , except for the out-of-town truckers , and the Arties . The Arties do n't belong here . They come from out of state to stay at the fancy white team across from Bucky 's . In this barn they paint pictures or build things out of pieces of junk they find lying around . Once a couple of them made a life-sized bull out of rusty barbed wire . These people come across the road to Bucky 's , ask questions about cows and rattlesnakes , and after a few weeks one batch leaves , another comes . I do n't like them much . Sometimes my father goes alone to Bucky 's when it 's too late for Ben to be up and about . This year he went to Bucky 's at night more than he usually does , right up to lambing time , which made me nervous . But I should n't have worried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> And sure enough , when the time came , he banged on our bedroom doors . " It 's time , " he called . The clock said five thirty We 'd been ready for this for a few days . Ben and I stumbled out of our rooms , fetched the buckets , the bundle of clean rags , and a piece of rope , climbed into the pickup . The sound of the sharp red stones under the wheels seemed to crack the quiet dark night wide open . We did n't need to speak . Before my mother got sick , she 'd be with us , with a thermos of hot coffee and blankets to help us stay warm . <p> The ewes were in the corral where my father had penned them a few days ago . They lay on the ground , most of them , in no particular way , the unborn lambs mounding up their bellies like piles of dirty snow . The shape of them was all you could see in the darkness . Their eyes would be too dumb to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ born bleated for their mothers . <p> My father moved from one ewe to the other , lifting their tails , feeling their bellies , pushing down when he thought it would help . When a lamb came out , he lifted it into the air by its hind feet to make sure it was breathing . Held up like that , newborn lambs look like wet chickens ready for the pot . Ben and I knew what to do . We tipped the water buckets for the ewes to sip . We patted the rubbery long lambs with rags to dry them . <p> The sun burst over the ridge sudden and white , scattering flecks of light across the jagged hills like salt , stinging our eyes . We looked up from what we were doing and blinked at each other as if we 'd just noticed where we were . All the lambs had gotten born with no trouble , except for one . The ewe named Sally would not lie down . She paced around and made silly baa 's like she did n't want to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over to rub his bad leg , and said , " Let 's go home . We 'll come back later for Sally . I think she 's just a slow one . " But his eyes looked worried , and I knew there would be trouble . The lamb might be turned around . Sometimes when that happens he has to pull the lamb apart inside its mother . I set the rope down just outside the corral , ready for later , and we went home to eat breakfast . <p> As we were finishing the last of the eggs I 'd scrambled , a car drove up . I looked out the window and saw a Volkswagen , which you almost never see around here . The driver was a woman . " You 'd better tell her to come another day , " I said to my father . <p> He pushed aside his plate , stood up quickly , went to the sink , ran the water , slicked some into his hair . " I asked her to come . " <p> Ben began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to slap him . <p> My father was at the door and in came this women wearing jeans and a clean red shirt . Her hair was cut in bangs and was shorter in the back than in the front , straight and very shiny . She was thin , a little flat . Though she was at least as old as my father , she was kind of pretty . <p> " This is Drew , " my father said . Ben jumped out of his chair and ran over to her . I wanted to yank him away . <p> " Drew ? " I said , wrinkling my nose . " That 's very funny . You must be one of those Arties . " My father frowned at me . I took a deep breath , offered the woman a chair , and said , " Have some coffee . I made it myself . I always make the coffee . " <p> Then I took the woman on a tour of the house , led her by the hand from room to room . When she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled a little , then put the back of her hand to her mouth to cover it . <p> The four of us squeezed into the pickup . I had to sit with my feet around the stick . Ben sat on the woman 's lap , and after a little while he leaned into her as if he 'd known this lap his whole life . I expected this woman to chatter the way Arties do , but she was quiet , staring ahead at the long hills of sagebrush . She looked sort of sad . She began patting Ben 's shoulder , absently , lightly , as if she 'd done this before . My father looked at the hand out of the corner of his eye , then he looked quickly at the woman 's face , quickly away . <p> The sheep pen was filled with the noise of the mothers baaing deep in their throats and the squeaky lost bleats of the half-day lambs . The animals wandered around foolishly , calling , staring past one another as if they 'd given up hope of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they know who their mothers are ? " the woman said . <p> " They 'll sort themselves out , " my father said , which was not the truth . He 'd match them up later . Sally stood at the end of the corral , her sides bulging like sacks of flour . She was panting . She ran away from my father when he walked toward her , so he had to chase her around the corral to get her down . Even with his limp , he 's fast . Her dumb eyes rolled back as he wrestled her to the ground . " Hold her , " he said . <p> I stood back some , waiting to see what this woman would do . She gave a little sigh , then knelt into the red dust beside the ewe . She pulled Sally 's head onto her lap , stroked it like it was a cat , and made little sounds in her throat . <p> My father lay on the ground behind the ewe and shoved his arm up inside her . When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across its neck , her face nearly into the dirty fleece . Into Sally 's ear she said , " Poor Mom . There , there , " as if that would help . <p> " Its legs are caught , " my father said . He drew his arm slowly out of the ewe . It was covered with water and blood <p> " You 'll have to tear it up , " Ben said . " I hate this . " He spun away from us , started chasing the lambs . <p> My father looked across the ewe at the woman . He said , " I did n't ask you to come here for this . " <p> The woman nodded and gave a scared-looking smile . " It 's all right . " She stared at his bloody arm . Then two of them stared at each other for a long time Finally , he shook himself a little and said to me , " Go get the rope . I 'm going to try to pull it out . " <p> Ben was holding a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dust . When he saw me go for the rope , he dropped the lamb and ran over to us . " I hate it when you use the rope , " he said . But he squatted down to watch . <p> My father reached back inside Sally , and the woman closed her eyes as if she was praying . " I 've found its head , " he said at last . He took the rope from me , tied a loop in it , and pushed it up into the ewe . It was hard work and his face fumed red . Finally he pulled out his arm and handed the end of the rope to me . When I count three , we 'll both pull . " He looked down at the woman , who was still sprawled across Sally . " Hold her tight now . Grab her there , by the shoulders . " The woman breathed in deep and hitched both her arms around the sheep . <p> Ben rocked back on his heels . " Hope you do n't break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The woman was stronger than she looked and held tight . Sally groaned and bulged her eyes . " Again , " he said to me . " Harder . " Then the lamb slipped out . My father lifted the loop off its neck , jerked open the lamb 's mouth , and scooped out a gob of blood and mucus . Then he put his mouth to the lamb 's , breathed into it , breathed again . " Live , " he said . " Goddamn you , live . " It seemed like everything he ever cared about was being poured into this one limp , oversized lamb . <p> After a while he scowled and flung the lamb down , embarrassed by all that fussing . " It 's breathing , " he said . " Let 's go . " He looked down at Sally , who was still lying down , her sides sucked in hollow now and drenched in sweat . " She 'll either take him or she wo n't  --  if she lives . " The woman rolled away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd been in a deep sleep . <p> When we got back to the house , I asked the woman to ride with me on the three-wheeler down to throw hay to the horses . I could see she would rather not . She looked sort of pale . But I made it seem like it would hurt my feelings if she did n't . " Not too fast , please , " she said . I looked right at her and said in my mother-voice " I 'm a responsible person . My father depends on me . " <p> " There 's no place to hang on , " she said . <p> " Hang onto me , " I said . I saw that she was staring at my father with the same look as when she saw his bloody arm . She wanted to be with him , not go off with me . Well , she would have to wait a little longer . <p> Ben ran up to us and grabbed hold of the woman 's leg . " Take us to the Bighorns , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I said , " Our dad 's going to take us . " Ben began to whine . He grabbed higher on the woman 's leg and tried to pull himself up to her lap . " I think that would be dangerous , " the woman said , and tried to stop him with her hands . She looked worried , kept pushing against the wheeler with her feet to find a place to rest them . <p> My father stepped forward and lifted Ben into his arms . Ben was crying loudly . Huge tears spurted outward from his eyes . I jammed my foot down on the throttle , gunned the engine to its fiercest pitch . The woman flung her arms around my waist . I smiled , let the motor settle , then drove slowly to the horse pasture , careful to miss the rocks , the gullies and dips , the clumps of sagebrush . <p> I knew that in the slow time of late afternoon when this woman had gone , my father would take us back to the sheep pen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and put each family together in separate pens at the edge of the corral . And if Sally would n't take the lamb or if she died , we 'd get to carry it home and feed it . <p> The woman came back the next day . Such a nice woman , wanting to give Ben and me what we 'd begged for all those years . She said , " I 'll take you to the Bighorns . " And then my father said , " Great idea . We 'll take the truck . More room for our gear . " I would have to straddle the stick again . Suddenly my father had all the time in the world to leave the ranch and do what he would not do just for his own kids , no matter how they 'd begged . He called a neighbor to come feed the animals , look in on the lambs . Why had n't he thought of that long ago ? <p> But yes , it was exciting to see the mountains coming closer and then to be inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road curving into the bright sky , the sheer dizzy drops . When we were just about as high as you could get , not long before we stopped to camp , we drove past a place called Medicine Wheel . Like a schoolteacher , the woman explained that Medicine Wheel was a sacred site that used to belong to the Indians . People said you could feel the good spirits when you went near it . " Be very quiet , " she said . " See if you do n't feel different all of a sudden . " Then she and my father turned to each other . A look went between them as if they were the only ones there " You felt it ? " she said in a kind of whisper . My father nodded slowly looked embarrassed . " Felt what ? " Ben cried , and bounced on her lap . " What ? What ? " I pretended I had n't heard . <p> Ben and I had to sleep in the back of the truck . My father slept in our tent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this woman pulled the sleeping bags out of the stuff sacks and spread them into the tent like she owned it . In the morning she came out of the tent wearing a blue bathrobe and smiling more than was right . She cooked pancakes in our frying pan over the fire and even made the coffee . After breakfast , it was her idea to walk around the lake . <p> So we walked , not saying much . The peaks jutted up around the lake like a giant 's ring of fire stones . We climbed over slabs of pale granite that tilted like old sidewalks , sloshed through the fat snow crystals of spring-melt , rotting leaves , deadfall . The sun on the water flashed like the bottoms of a million leaves , and the air was so sweet you wanted to gulp it down like water . I remember it like a movie I wish I had n't seen yet . <p> We walked for a long time and Ben was tired . Back at camp we ate hot dogs roasted on green sticks . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by themselves , leaving me and Ben alone in the campsite . Ben climbed into the cab of the truck and fell asleep . I thought of taking a swim , but then I 'd ruin my curls . Instead , I filled a pan with water from the lake , doused the campfire though it was already out , just for something to do . I spread the wet ashes around some with a stick , wondered if my father had remembered to lock up the three-wheeler in the barn , wondered if Sally had died from the hard birth of her lamb . <p> When we drove out of the Bighorns , my father 's eyes were sad . A heavy silence weighed us all down , even Ben , who curled up on the woman 's lap , not wiggling as he usually did . It seemed to take a long time to get home , and when we did , the woman gave Ben a long hug . Then she ran her hand down my father 's arm as if it was a piece of velvet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply said , " Goodbye . " Then she drove away in her Volkswagen and never came back . <p> Ben cried when my father said she probably was n't going to see us again , cried many times again in the days afterwards . My father was no help . He spent hours out by the pond throwing rocks into the water . I had to remind him that there were the horses to be fed , hay bales to be bucked , the lambs to be checked . <p> Everything is almost normal again . The days are coming in hot even before the sun is over the ridge . The horses stay in the shade by the pond , their heads drooping down . Sally is all right , and her big lamb gambols along with the others , never knowing how close it came to being torn apart inside its mother . <p> There 's no haze today and the Bighorns seem almost close . I wish we had n't already gone to them . It was something I wanted for so long , and now it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time with just my father and Ben . The woman who took us to the Bighorns was nice enough , but no one should replace our rightful mother . I 'm glad she went away . <p> I set my saddle on the fence by the back door and begin to walk to the pasture to fetch my horse . How good it feels to ride a horse ! I love knowing I can control something that can pound the rocks into dust and explode the smell of sage into my hair . Today I want to ride so bad , I can feel the electricity in my legs . But the phone rings , and because my father depends on me , I run inside the house to answer it . <p> " This is Drew , " says the voice . <p> " Who ? " I 'd forgotten her name , but it 's her voice all right . She says her name again , says she 's calling long-distance and she asks to speak to my father . <p> I feel afraid all of a sudden , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like weathered sandstone , and so I am glad I can honestly say , " He 's to the lambs . " <p> She does n't say anything for a minute , then , " How are you ? How 's Ben ? " <p> I say to her , " I have n't got time to talk right now . " I want to ride my horse , ride him right now , over to where the lambs are , and see if my father needs help . Ben is visiting our aunt in Sheridan . Sometimes it 's a relief to have him gone . My aunt wanted me to visit , too , but I know my father needs me here . He depends on me . If something changed that , what would happen to me ? <p> Another silence , and , " Could you ask him to call me ? I 'll give you my new number . " <p> " I have n't got a pencil , " I tell her . <p> " Could you find one ? Please ? " <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but ca n't find one . Even so , I pick up the receiver and say , " All right . " <p> The woman tells me the number twice , loudly and slowly as if I 'm deaf or stupid , makes me say it back to her . " Be sure to tell him , " she says . " It 's important . " I write the number on the table with my finger and say , as if I 'm in a dream and not myself at all , " Yeah , I got it . " <p> The woman says a nice goodbye and hangs up . I fill a thermos with lemonade and go outside . The heat floods into my face as I feel the shame of my lie , but already the sun is spreading little heat-lakes of light across the pasture , the red rock bleeds into the sagebrush , and I know my father will be glad I 've come . <p> <p> By Nancy Roberts <p>               @ @ @ @ @ @
