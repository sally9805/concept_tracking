<p> Officials of Denver International and Front Range airports are asking for the same gift from United Parcel Service this holiday season - UPS ' commitment to build a major package distribution hub at one of the two airports . <p> Denver officials say if Front Range succeeds in landing the cargo carrier , it could open a legal challenge to Denver 's current mutual agreement with Adams County to bar passenger service at Front Range . <p> " I 'm concerned about the potential for expansion to passenger service " at Front Range , said Denver City Council member Allegra " Happy " Haynes , chair of the council 's airport committee . <p> Officials of Front Range simply say that their airport - with its close proximity to Interstate 70 and a nearby Union Pacific Railroad line - is an ideal location for UPS ' proposed intermodal hub . <p> Intermodal refers to the combination of air , rail and truck freight service within a single operation . <p> " I 'm rooting for Front Range Airport , " said Fuller and Co. broker Stew Mosko @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " to DIA officials until Front Range and Adams County began pursuing the UPS deal . Fuller manages land partnerships in the vicinity of both airports . <p> Over the next 10 days , Denver is expected to forward a proposal to UPS calling for DIA to construct additional taxiways and concrete aprons worth about $ 22 million on DIA 's border to accommodate a " through-the-fence " freight operation for UPS . <p> DIA would fund the project with money from its capital fund or by issuing additional airport bond debt . <p> Through-the-fence refers to a venture in which UPS would buy private land on DIA 's southern or western border for construction of a huge package distribution center . For its part of the venture , DIA would build a 1 million-square-foot concrete apron and associated taxiways as a staging area for UPS jet aircraft on the city 's side of the fence . <p> UPS delivery trucks would travel through the fence , ferrying packages between parked planes and the distribution center . The company likes the through-the-fence option because it aims to own its distribution centers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , UPS operates a more modest freight facility on DIA property in the airport 's south cargo complex under a five-year lease . The package company has eight round-trip cargo flights every day , paying Denver about $ 1.5 million in landing fees annually . <p> UPS spokesman Ken Shapero said the company now has a " gateway " operation at DIA . Flights from larger UPS air hubs funnel freight into DIA for distribution throughout the region . <p> But the regional hub that UPS is considering for Front Range or DIA would be a far larger operation , handling at least 20 daily round-trip flights . <p> DIA officials say the $ 2 million or more in additional landing fees generated by an expanded UPS operation would pay for the city 's taxiway and apron improvements for the company . <p> While Denver readies its proposal for UPS , Front Range Airport officials have put theirs on autopilot . <p> " Front Range is a natural solution for a cargo hub ; it 's a forced solution at DIA , " said Front Range aviation director Dennis Heap . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , " he added . " DIA may come up with something that will work . " <p> Heap said advantages that Front Range brings to UPS include runways that would be within yards of the company 's freight terminal and the close proximity of I-70 and the Union Pacific line , which runs across the southern border of the small airport . <p> In contrast , UPS planes could have taxi distances of as much as two miles to DIA 's runways , Heap said . <p> To get UPS , Front Range would have to extend its two 8,000-foot runways each to 10,000 feet and add taxiways and ramp areas adjacent to UPS ' planned 500,000-square-foot distribution center . The airport also would need de-icing facilities and a new tower . <p> The price tag for all these improvements would exceed $ 20 million and if the cargo company chooses Front Range , the hub could be in operation by 1999 and employ about 650 UPS workers at the start , Heap said . <p> The airport would pay for the UPS improvements with the increased landing fees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be used for the improvements , according to Adams County officials . <p> UPS had revenues last year of about $ 20 billion and the company has always been known for its distinctive brown local delivery trucks and over-the-road rigs . Yet the air express business of UPS is the company 's fastest-growing and most profitable segment . <p> UPS now has a jet fleet of 226 aircraft including highly advanced 757s and 767s . <p> The company has air cargo hubs in Louisville , Ky. ; Columbia , S.C. ; Philadelphia ; Dallas ; Rockford , Ill. ; and Ontario , Calif . UPS ' hub at Dallas-Fort Worth Airport opened last year and cost $ 30 million . It has about 1,000 employees and expects to double the workforce over the next decade . <p> The Rocky Mountain area is an obvious candidate for a UPS regional air hub , but DIA and Front Range are competing with other cities in the region to land the facility . <p> Shapero said an intermodal hub at either DIA or Front Range would be the company 's first to fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said such a hub primarily would help the company grow its 3 Day Select service . <p> UPS has delivery services that include Next Day Air , 2nd Day Air and 3 Day Select . Other services with longer delivery times typically use over-the-road trucks . <p> Shapero said 3 Day Select and the multiple modes of air , rail and truck that it uses creates the most complex logistical challenges for UPS . <p> Denver officials say DIA 's selling points for UPS include the airport 's snow removal and firefighting and rescue capabilities and advanced navigational aids that allow landings in low-visibility conditions . <p> They also cite the closer proximity of a site on DIA 's periphery to UPS ' existing package delivery complex at 52nd Avenue and Ivy Street in Commerce City and the availability of spare parts for UPS jets from other carriers at DIA . <p> Owners of land around DIA and economic development officials say the real competition for the UPS hub is less between DIA and Front Range airports and more between the Denver area and other cities in the region , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Albuquerque . UPS ' regional air hub will spur other nearby commercial development wherever the company puts the facility , said Bruce O'Donnell of L.C. Fulenwider Inc. , a major property owner on DIA 's periphery . <p> " It 's like a shopping center getting Nordstrom as an anchor tenant , " O'Donnell said . " UPS will be a catalyst for development anywhere they land . " <p> Aurora Economic Development Council President Julie Bender and other officials said the Denver area will benefit whether the UPS hub is built at DIA or Front Range . <p> " The most important issue is for metro Denver to capture ( UPS ' ) Rocky Mountain hub , " she said , pointing to competition from other cities in the region . <p> Van Schaack Holdings Ltd. owns land just west of DIA at 88th Avenue , an area named as a possible site for the through-the-fence UPS complex . <p> A second site at DIA is on the airport 's southern border at 68th Avenue , a parcel owned by Monaghan Farms Inc . <p> The property is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UPS because highway interchanges are planned nearby at 56th and 64th avenues when the E-470 beltway is extended past DIA on the west . The $ 650 million E-470 extension from Parker Road to 120th Avenue is scheduled for completion by 1999 . <p> " Our main thrust is to keep UPS " at DIA , whether on the west or south sides of the airport , said Van Schaack managing general partner partner Tony Combs . " We 've given them viable options so DIA is the most attractive place to be . "
