Ted Hamilton is night manager at the Eagle , a seedy Liverpool hotel whose habitues " wander in from twelve o'clock onwards ... clutching at their down-below parts , ready for their lonely bit of action . " The narrator of this slangy , tangy first novel from Britain has seen it all . Or so he thinks , until the Eagle falls into the hands of managers from the head office , who express concern for their " customer-stroke-guests " while remaining oblivious to the shenanigans under their noses . Throw in a racist thug , some lovable Cockneys and Rastafarians , and a whiff of violence , and you 've got a small bomb just waiting to explode . The plot here is incidental ; what takes center stage is the driving , driven narrative voice . <P>  --  By Elizabeth Gleick
