TIME OF THE GYPSIES Directed by Emir Kusturica <P> Screenplay by Gordan Mihic and Emir Kusturica <P> Time of the Gypsies  --  what a drab handle for such a sprawling , enthralling entertainment . The title promises a 60 Minutes-style expose on purse snatching and child exploitation in the tourist capitals of Europe . And is anyone in a hurry to see a 2-hr. 22-min. film in Romany with English subtitles ? As it happens , the movie does take time for side trips from Yugoslavia to Italy , to show young Gypsies stealing and pimping at their bosses ' stern whims . But its heart is in a Serbian village of Gypsies , where outcasts find a family and fevered dreams are as tangible and intimate as a relative come to sleep in the crowded shack called home . <P> " When God came down to earth , " a villager says , " he took one look at the Gypsies and took the next flight back . " But God left a couple of things behind : the gift of magic  --  black magic or white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curse of belief in it . Women levitate as they give birth ; the veils of dead brides float in the rank breeze . Proud , loving Hatidza ( Ljubica Adzovic ) has the power of healing , and her grandchild Perhan ( Davor Dujmovic ) can do a few telekinetic tricks too . We wo n't even discuss  --  because they come at the end of this beggar 's banquet of a film  --  the walking outhouse and the killer fork . <P> Perhan is a comer , and not just because he can move a spoon up a wall with his bare will . The teenager is eager to escape his wastrel uncle Merdzan ( Husnija Hasimovic ) , who practices Tai Chi and chases every village female over twelve . Perhan is desperate to pay the hospital bills for his crippled sister ( Elvira Sali ) and earn enough money to marry his girlfriend Azra ( Sinolicka Trpkova ) . He must do it quickly , before Merdzan can get his lecherous hands on her . " Make sure her feet do n't see more sky than earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the richest , meanest man in town . Ahmed ( Bora Todorovic ) is a blustery gangster who will teach Perhan the rules of petty crime but will take a long time to learn how fierce are the strains of loyalty and revenge in his brightest pupil . Ahmed will finally get the point on the day he dies : his wedding day . <P> Yes , this is a Gypsy Godfather , its spiky authenticity achieved by an almost all Gypsy cast . Director Emir Kusturica ( When Father Was Away on Business ) neither romanticizes nor flinches from the popular image of Gypsies as a primitive , stealthy people . But he also sees them as a Third World nation of wanderers , displaced and dispossessed in the midst of European bounty . They can survive only on their dreams and their cunning ; the film 's buoyant visual style is true to both . It is the style of magic realism , the blending of grit and sorcery that soars through the novels of Gabriel Garcia Marquez . Kusturica knows that magic realism finds its perfect home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the big screen everything must be real because we see it . And in the time of the Gypsies , it is always once upon a time .
