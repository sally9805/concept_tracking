All through 1994 , Jack Kemp traveled the country helping local Republican candidates while collecting chits for his own presidential bid , which he planned to make in 1996 . In late October he was in Birmingham , Alabama . The overflow crowd had come to hear the most publicly irrepressible and optimistic G.O.P. politician since Teddy Roosevelt , and for a time , Kemp delivered as promised . His old football stories were laced with lessons : " I learned about the market 's power when I was traded to the Buffalo Bills for $100 . " His tales recalled the Gipper 's golden age : " The world changed because Ronald Reagan had the courage of his convictions . " He did n't have to mention what everyone knew : Reagan had borrowed his beliefs from Kemp , the Elmer Gantry of supply-side economics . <P> The audience roared , but the self-described " bleeding-heart conservative " had something else to say . Forming fists with his words , Kemp thundered , " Republicans in California want to deny assistance to the children of illegal immigrants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school . Think about that . Is that what the party of Lincoln is about ? We ca n't just welcome the less fortunate and minorities . We have to reach out to them . We are obliged to help them become like the rest of us in this room . It is not only the morally right thing to do , " Kemp said quietly for emphasis . " It 's the politically smart thing to do too . " <P> Dumbstruck , the crowd stood mute . Afterward , Kemp slumped in a folding chair . For the first time in 25 years , I saw an incredible force depressed . " This is n't my party anymore , " he brooded . " You saw it . They rejected the message . Without compassion , the party will have no future . And I wo n't either . " <P> Three months later , pleading a distaste for fund raising , Kemp announced that he would n't run in ' 96 after all . <P> Now he 's back , the beneficiary of desperation . Kemp will probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones uttered to friends last spring , and denying them will be easy for him . Kemp long ago mastered an essential element of politics , the art of behaving as if no one has any memory . He will enthusiastically and repeatedly praise a man he has loathed , and preacher that he is , he may even come to believe what he says . <P> But before he was drafted last week , Kemp thought Dole was doomed . The Senator might have a chance if , say , Clinton were indicted in the Whitewater case , Kemp said last April . But short of that , victory seemed impossible . Kemp marveled at Dole 's stamina but contended that the Senator was " old and tired in the ideas sense . " And even if Dole believed in the kind of policies that could excite people , Kemp reasoned , Dole 's legislative mind-set would probably cause him to " make a mess of it . " Clinton , Kemp concluded , " will kill him . " <P> But maybe not them . Kemp has the true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than Dole , can be propelled to the forefront , maybe Clinton will expire instead . " But the No. 2s never get you much , " Democratic patriarch Larry O'Brien once said , as he recalled the equally odd coupling of John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson in 1960 . " They can help some , as Lyndon did in Texas , and that 's why you choose someone you ca n't stand . But in the end , it 's the guy on top who carries you . " Or doesn't.
