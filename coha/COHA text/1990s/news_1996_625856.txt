<p> Houston Police Chief Sam Nuchia got hit Thursday with what he called " " the mark of the beast " - 666 lawyers in the Houston Bar Association 's judicial candidate poll rated him " " not qualified " to be an appellate judge . <p> Nuchia , however , pointed out that 513 attorneys rated him " " qualified " and 480 rated him " " well qualified " to be an associate justice on the 1st Court of Appeals . <p> " " A lot of lawyers are not aware I actually , besides being a police officer , am an experienced prosecutor , " Nuchia said . " " I had nearly five years as a prosecutor . I won 30 trials in federal court and did two appeals , including one I argued in the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals . " <p> He ticked off a list of well-known lawyers whose clients got convicted in court cases he prosecuted , including former U.S. Attorney Tony Canales and two brothers , Mike DeGeurin and Dick DeGuerin . <p> " " At least 40 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm qualified to be a judge , " Nuchia quipped . <p> Nuchia , 50 , a Republican , will face attorney George Ellis , 63 , a Democrat , in the general election . Both do not have opponents in their parties ' primaries March 12 . <p> Ellis , a judge on the 14th Court of Appeals here from 1982 until he was defeated in 1994 , was rated " " well qualified " by 576 Houston lawyers , " " qualified " by 616 lawyers and " " not qualified " by 388 . <p> Faring much worse than Nuchia was Carolyn Day Hobson , a 61st District Court candidate ranked " " not qualified " by 1,204 attorneys and " " well qualified " by only 156 . Justice of the Peace Betty Brock Bell , seeking re-election to the Precinct 7 , Place 1 post , got 481 " " not qualified " votes and 86 " " well qualified " rankings . <p> The lawyer most favored by the bar association was Texas Supreme Court Chief Justice Tom Phillips , a former Houston district judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1,841 lawyers and " " not qualified " by 153 . Place 1 Supreme Court Justice John Cornyn had 1,260 " " well qualified " votes , and Place 3 Supreme Court Justice Greg Abbott had 1,834 " " well qualified " votes . <p> In the 12-candidate battle to succeed retiring Precinct 5 , Place 1 Justice of the Peace Paul Till , attorney ( SEE CORRECTION ) Mark Fury got 129 " " well qualified " votes and just 73 " " not qualified " marks . Attorney Nick Lykos , had 103 " " well qualified " votes and 156 " " not qualified . " <p> According to Houston Bar Association President Charles Gregg , this year 's poll was notable for containing the names of three non-lawyers - Supreme Court candidates Harry L. Bowles , Gideon Mark Bowers and Ray Dittmar . All together , the three Libertarian candidates were marked " " well qualified " by 53 Houston attorneys . <p> In previous years the bar poll has been criticized by people who felt some lawyers casting votes had scant actual knowledge of the judges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joel Androphy said , lawyers who are " " non-litigators " were asked to refrain from voting . <p> The outcome was that 2,650 lawyers cast ballots - about 30 percent of the bar association 's 8,825 members . Androphy pointed to the big numbers of rating attorneys who did not cast ballots in many races as evidence that the raters were honestly following instructions . <p> Androphy said candidates with " " cute " names - Supreme Court candidates Andrew Jackson Kupper and Gene Kelly , and appellate candidate James " " Daniel " Boone - clearly were not benefited by their eye-catching monikers . <p> Gregg referred back to a Texas Lawyer article that suggested bias toward women candidates in the poll , but the 1996 results showed women fared very well . Gregg said the outcome indicates the article 's thrust was unfounded . <p> Judicial Qualification Poll <p> Results of the Houston Bar Associations 1996 Judicial Qualification Poll . A total of 2,650 lawyers returned surveys about the qualifications of candidates in contested judicial races in the March primaries and November general election . <p> Attorneys responding to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well qualified .
