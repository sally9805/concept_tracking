A Flurry of Friends : Stories of Animal Companions . Gentle Spirits <p> It was a time of great spiritual cleansing in my life . I was in the midst of meditation releasing some long-held family issues when there was a knock at the door . My tiny neighbor boy , only five , held a large tank in his arms , filled with tiny , leaping frogs . " I caught these for you . I knew you needed them , " he said . <p> Well , what could I say to a gift like that ? I graciously accepted , and twenty-three tiny frogs entered our family 's life . My children and I spent hours learning about the fascinating life of frogs , and I found myself drawn to them night after sleepless night . I knew each and every tiny face , whom they linked to snuggle with when they slept , the fastest swimmer , highest hopper , and most accomplished escape artist . The frogs entered my life when I was looking for answers , and I was profoundly moved by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I found that they were outgrowing the tank and brought them to a nearby river and released them . As I said my farewells , I knew they whispered their own in chorus , and their tiny spirits flowed with mine in reverent embrace . My Furry Midwife <p> I never cherished the companionship of Lulu , our lively basset hound , until I got pregnant . I have always been a " cat person " but when my husband insisted that we needed a dog , I finally gave in . Lulu always seemed to be in the way , panting and whining and capering all over me and my guests . I 'm afraid that I was n't very patient with her . <p> But all this changed during my pregnancy . Lulu Belle began to follow me everywhere , calming down and becoming a quiet , soulful presence . She cuddled up to me and took naps with me ; her whole manner became sweeter and more attentive . I wondered how she could possibly know what was going on inside my body , but it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look forward to our quiet times together . As the months went by and my belly became bigger and rounder , I would point to it and say to Lulu , " Look , there 's a puppy inside there ! " She always looked as if she knew exactly what I was talking about . <p> When I finally went into labor , Lulu refused to leave my side . She jumped up on my bed and moaned with me during my contractions . Even when my friends tried to coax her out of the room with her favorite treats , she refused to budge . She seemed to think of herself as my furry , four-legged midwife . <p> When the ( human ) midwife arrived , she insisted that Lulu had to leave . It took two people to drag Lulu from the room , and she planted herself firmly outside my door and cried for hours . She stayed there , standing a restless vigil , for hours while my labor dragged on . Unable to complete my labor at home , the midwife , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me later that Lulu " went ballistic " after I left and would n't even look at him when he returned from the hospital without me later that evening . <p> When we brought home our baby girl Erynn , Lulu was ecstatic . She eagerly licked and sniffed her , greeting her with eager joy . Whenever the baby cried , Lulu was immediately there , or would run and find me if I was in another room , as if to remind me of my ( her ? ) responsibility . <p> Lulu showed me a great deal about unconditional love and loyalty , and she is still a wonderful member of our family . My Animal Family <p> Early every morning , my first devotion is to go to the " snake room " . There is my sacred cave live fifteen serpent friends and companions , each precious and a gift from the Goddess and her loving God . Many of the snakes are familiars , some are still babies and will go to " their " people when it is time ; many will remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they continuously reassure me they are enjoying . <p> My companions are not only snakes , however . Our howling Dog Family sets my spirit free whenever I go outside to them and join in their howling . Laughing together , we release all our tensions , blending with packs from the mountains and cities , singing to and with our friends . <p> Little Brown Mouse scurries out to meet me and greet me every day . We talk and play , and she darts from hand to hand , enjoying my affection and love . She gives her babies to Snake , willing to serve as part of the journey . Sometimes people frown and judge me for keeping mice to be fed to the snakes , but Little Brown Mouse knows the cycle of life in a way that predates our western human understanding . She knows me as an ally , a friend , not a Master of Mistress . <p> Light Boy , the black rat , loves to be cuddled and snuggles and holds me when I 'm feeling sad . His friends , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guests when they enter our home . My guests , appalled , whisper , " They are n't for the snakes , are they ? " " No , " I reply , " Light Boy and his friends are part of our family . " <p> Wild Turkey , a flock of friends , gathers often behind our deck , gobbling , " Feed us ! " They soothe me with their singing , their chortles and cooings , and even their fighting and pecking teaches me . " Birds are reptiles with wings , " a vet once told me , and so I think of the turkeys as dinosaur descendents , a bit of our wild past outside my house . <p> My friend Fly taught me stillness and how to lose my fear of yellow jackets . Perched on my finger , she challenged me to stillness . After many tries , I found that I could finally be still when the yellow jacket buzzed by and not panic with fear . " Stillness , " said my friend Fly , and I listened and learned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delusional , worried about my life in the country with my friends . They sometimes call me crazy but I and my many nonhuman friends know that I am following my heartsong . Home Life with Cat <p> Beastie jumps awake as soon as the clock radio sounds , blinking his yellow eyes . He slowly walks along the covers up to my should and lies down in the crook of my arm , placing his outstretched paw softly but insistently on my shoulder . When I stroke his back he squeezes his eyes shut with pleasure . It 's the beginning of another day . <p> We have breakfast together , and , when I leave for work , I kiss him gently on the top of his head , between his pert little ears . " Bye , bye , Beastie , " I say , and he ducks a little , as if my affection is a bit of an imposition on his dignity . <p> We spend the day apart , but I still think of him from time to time . I have a photo of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it gives me comfort . When I come home , Beastie comments insistently from behind the door if I spend too much time unlocking it . Especially if I have been out late , his tone is quite demanding , and I fuss over him immediately to make up for my absence . He forgives me quickly - especially if I stroke him behind the ears . <p> Together , we go down to the building lobby to check the mail-box , and , if the weather is nice , we sit on the front step together . Friendly neighbors say hello to me and marvel at my well-behaved , beautiful cat . <p> We go back inside and make dinner . After Beastie enjoys his , he plays with we while I try to enjoy mine , often engaging me in a game of hid and and seek or tag , just as I 'm sitting down to eat . He leads me on a wild and crazy chase through and around the house , up a chair , down the back , up a widow still , down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my dinner , and he approaches to beg me for some . No matter what I 'm having , he wants some . Usually I end up being firm and saying " No , " but sometimes I give in . <p> Throughout the evening , Beastie says beside me , quietly sitting while I read or watch TV or whatever . When I am ready for bed , I turn off the light , walk down the hallway and enjoy the delicious sensation of falling into a comfortable bed . A little time later , a floorboard will creak , and I will see his dark shadow move into the room . The bed wobbles gently as he puts up a tentative paw , then leaps up to join me . He settles in near my feet , or , if it is especially cold , he will stretch along my side for warmth . <p> I say goodnight to him and , in the moonlight from the window , his green eyes reflect back to me what seems to be a message of comfort . <p> My soft , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ready to go to sleep . When I hold him , I feel endlessly wealthy , as if life is an abundance of love and goodness . As Beastie 's caretaker , I am surprised to be blessed with his presence - I feel like a lottery winner . <p> Of course , I know the cliche of a lonely person making an animal out to be more than it is , to be like a human companion . But Beastie is not human , and I am not lonely . The love I feel for him is very distinct from what pleasurable human society brings me . Animals can have more generous , affectionate , and playful temperaments than many people ; their companionship is quite different from human interaction . <p> Beastie falls asleep leaning against my ankle ; sometimes he snores , which wakes me up , but it 's a small price to pay for his company . I fall asleep again easily when it happens , and my sleep is restful and sweet and sure , with Beastie dreaming beside me . The Gift of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening , one of those lazy Saturdays blessed by Gaea with gentle breezes , fresh smells and a spirit that melts away the residue of a busy week past . I had just started making dinner when my five-year-old son David came slamming in the back door , wild-eyed . " Come look , Mom . You got ta come look now ! " I promised I would come , soon , but he was insistent . " No , Mom . Now . It wo n't be there if you wait . " <p> Wiping my hands on my shirt and turning off the stove , I glanced around to be sure nothing was sitting out for our three cats to attack in my absence . Then I followed him into the backyard . <p> No more than six feet away , perched lazily on our wire fence , was the most beautiful creature I 'd ever seen . Cocking her head to one side , examining me with one lively crimson eye , was an albino ring-necked dove . We stood there without a sound , unwilling to disturb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued to stay nearly motionless , I noticed that she was breathing hard and it occurred to me to wonder how far she had flown . I decided that she might need some food and water , and went inside to get a bowl , collecting a bag of wild birdseed on my way through the porch . <p> I 'm sure I was a comic figure as I crouched down low and duckwalked carefully to her side , holding up first a bowl of water , then seed . Still she sat , eyes alert and questioning , but unmoving . <p> Emboldened by her willingness to have me close , I poured the seed in my hand and held it within her reach . She twisted her head to look first at me , then the seed , and then pecked at it . We gasped in unison and then watched in amazement as she hopped over to my hand to continue her meal . <p> I began to stand , hoping to take her into the porch where she could rest . It occurred to me that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heal . Slowly I moved with her to the porch . She rode with ease as she let herself be lifted to the hanging fluorescent work light . Immediately she came to life , strutting up and down the light frame , bobbing her head and studying the unnatural rumple of back porch litter . Then she cooed . Lifting the water and seed to rest with her atop the light , we decided to go inside and leave her alone . <p> Walking into the kitchen , our reverie was broken by the sound of our biggest black cat , purring and asking for dinner . " My god , " I said , suddenly remembering . " We have cats ! " <p> We eventually found a way around that dilemma ; after a long process of trying to find out where she had come from , we finally gave Joy ( the name seemed perfect ) a home in a large bird cage with a potted ivy cutting , a crystal and an old mirror . <p> Life went back to normal , with a cooing dove hanging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window . She talked to us in the evenings , answered to us when we called , and , after we 'd safely secured the cats behind closed doors , she 'd fly to be wherever we were . <p> Then , in December , I got sick . It started like the flu , but kept hanging on , and by Christmas I was losing weight and confined to bed . All the while , Joy talked to me , gently coaxing my mind back to the peace and safety she embodied for me . When I was a friend gave me a book to read while I was convalescing , saying that she had been guided by Gaea to give it to me . I thanked her and put it aside , not having enough energy to read it . <p> Finally , weeks later , I opened the book , Ken Carey 's Return of the Bird Tribes , and my eyes settled on a passage . " We are the superior intelligence that you are looking for in the galaxies . We have been in your parks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cages in your living rooms . We are the Bird Tribes . " <p> My head snapped up and I stared at Joy . Slowly she turned her head , casting her all-seeing eyes on my startled face - and cooed gently . <p> The tears came easily , tears of frustration and release , tears that had been locked up for years , lost in the struggles of daily life . That 's when I finally knew - we really are n't alone here . Something greater , something present in all Life sees and responds . We are part of a larger dance , all in it together , loving each other , protecting each other , leading each other . <p> Joy still lives with our family ; it 's been over five years now since she came to us . She 's still as captivating as the first day she sang for us ; in fact , she 's become such a conversationalist we often ca n't hear the television over her cooing . ( I usually take that as a sign ! ) She 's always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real glory of Gaea comes through the day to day appreciation of the little things we see everyday , the things which , if we wait , will be gone . <p> Article copyright SageWoman . <p> Article copyright Blessed Bee , Inc . <p> Illustration ( Three frogs ) <p>
