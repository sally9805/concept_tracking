THREE-QUARTERS OF A CENTURY HAS NOT BEEN TIME ENOUGH TO EFFACE THE REMNANTS OF VIOLENCE ALONG A FOUR-HUNDRED MILE FRONT <p> It is early fall in France , and the forest is silent and peaceful . A man , dressed in camouflage fatigues and carrying a metal detector and a sawed-off pickax , disappears into the misty underbrush . Here and there holes in the ground are half-filled with dead leaves ; strands of rusty barbed wire hang from corkscrewshaped metal posts . The forest , about forty miles from Paris , is officially called the Bois de la Brigade Marine . The French government has given this land to the United States ; Americans know it as Belleau Wood . It was here that men of a U.S. Marine Corps brigade , attached to the 2d Infantry Division of the American Expeditionary Forces , fought a desperate battle to keep the German army from reaching Paris in the summer of 1918 . Most visitors to the site look at the cemetery and its ornate chapel , the hunting lodge , the captured German 77-mm guns whose wheels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then they drive off to visit the imposing AisneMarne monument above Chateau-Thierry . Meanwhile , the man in camouflage is back , smiling . He has found what he was looking for : uniform buttons and a U.S.M.C. cap badge . Since his activity is now illegal , he vanishes with his treasure , adding to the collection of Marine relics he has been amassing for several years . <p> Today , seventy-five years after the armistice went into effect at 11:00 A.M. on the eleventh day of the eleventh month of 1918 , buses take thousands of people to visit the battlefields along a five-hundred-mile line stretching from the seacoast of Belgian Flanders to the French-Swiss border in Alsace . The tourists are mostly shown cemeteries , monuments , an occasional fort , towns mentioned in books , rebuilt in the twenties and showing few traces of war . Indeed , the French and the Belgians , faced with the utter devastation of lands where countless villages literally sank into the earth , wanted only to forget the disaster that had befallen them . Once the armistice was signed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prisoners of war , began to fill in the trenches and the millions of craters . They loaded entire trains with dud shells , tons of barbed wire and steel pickets , wagonfuls of the skulls and bones of thousands of men who never had a proper burial . In heavily contested areas like Verdun the land resisted all attempts at cultivation . It was only in the mid-thirties that someone discovered that Austrian black pines would grow in the lunar soil . Eventually the trees matured and are now being harvested , the stumps are bulldozed , the ground leveled , and hardwoods like beeches are planted . In another sixty-odd years these too will be cut , and the land may at last be returned to farming , as it was before 19 14 . <p> As a child growing up in France , I would spend hours looking at magazines illustrated with sepia-colored photographs of trenches filled with machine-gunned bodies and of French soldiers going into the attack , bayonets glinting in the sun . The " poilus " looked old and strange with their mustaches , ridged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their voices when they mentioned Verdun or the Chemin des Dames . The message , even to a child , was clear : These were places marked by Death . Years later I learned that about six hundred thousand men had died in Verdun in a tenmonth struggle that ended , like most other First World War battles , in stalemate . I also read about Loos , Ypres , and the Battle of the Somme , where the British Expeditionary Force suffered almost sixty thousand casualties in a single day . Once in a while I would wonder if these events , which took place before I was born , could truly have happened . It seemed incredible that a million and a half Frenchmen could have died in only four years and that another million had been maimed or gassed . Such a cataclysm must have left traces . If one hundred thousand shells exploded every day on the Verdun battleground , would n't a few be left ? I finally decided to go and look . <p> It was December 1984 when I arrived in Verdun , two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magazines seemed prosperous enough : blue-jeaned teenagers hung around , and people shopped for presents and bought daintily wrapped pastries or the famous local product , sugared-almond dragees . The next morning I drove up into the barren hills surrounding the city , where half-frozen soldiers , standing up to 210- and 420-mm shells , flamethrowers , and poison gas , had denied the German army access to the city at their backs . The well-maintained road wound through dense pine forests ; there was a monument here and there , a museum , the ruins of a fort . Disappointed , I parked on the shoulder and walked straight into the woodland . Then I froze as if I had been about to step on a coiled rattlesnake. jutting out of the earth were the fuzes of a dozen live artillery rounds . Beyond them I could see French canteens with their twin spigots , mess kits , a rusty metal bowl that had been a German helmet , a mosscovered hobnailed boot , more duds . There were shell holes everywhere of all sizes , some fifteen feet deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the so that had been dugouts . The war might have ended the previous year . I returned to Verdun several times over the course of five years and never ceased to be moved by the aura of the place . <p> In 1989 I was commissioned by the Mal de la Photo festival in Reims to photograph the traces of war in the Champagne region . Since my maternal grandfather had been mortally wounded in a September 1915 attack on the strongpoint of La Main-deMassiges , I went to see if anything was left of an offensive that had cost 250,000 lives . The landscape at first glance was devoid of any evidence of the then unprecedented three-day , nine-hundred-gun French bombardment . Tractors plowed the chalky fields , and the first spring buds were appearing . Local farmers , however , knew where to look , and they showed me around . In a week I had enough photographs for an exhibition at the Episcopal Palace , next to the thousand-year-old Reims Cathedral . <p> By that time friends were urging me to photograph other parts of the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Somme ? Have you been to Alsace ? You should see the Chemin des Dames ! Go and look at the soldiers ' carvings in Picardy . " Their suggestions pointed to one logical solution : Photograph all the remaining traces of war on the Western Front before they are gone . Already there were ominous signs : forests were being leveled ; scavengers with metal detectors were digging up battlefield relics ; bunkers were being bulldozed to make way for high-speed rail lines , highways , shopping malls , agribusiness , housing projects . Not to mention the fact that the surviving veterans were all past ninety years of age and fading away rapidly . <p> Beginning in 1990 , my wife , Anna , and I began seriously discussing the possibility of the two of us attempting what we were already calling " The Western Front Project . " The advice from experts , historians , and specialists was fairly unanimous : " You ca n't do it . It would take years , and besides , it 's all gone anyway " and " What about money ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in 1991 1 left for a fund-raising trip to Europe . There were vague promises , but nothing concrete . When I returned to New York , however , things began to look up . A generous donor offered a five-thousand-dollar seed grant , and we decided to head for France and Belgium immediately . We would cover as much ground as possible between September and Christmas , and if no further grants were forthcoming , we would return home and try again later . We rented a little red Renault , headed first for Belglum , and then sped across France . <p> At first we went about finding sites to photograph by trying to match old military maps to modern 1:25,000-scale ones , but this system did n't work : Most trenches had been filled in , and bunkers were n't where we thought they should be , or had been destroyed long ago . Eventually we asked the local people to show us what was still visible in their community , took the photograph , and then matched the site to the old map-in effect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " being the research that would have to be done to correlate the visual information to what had taken place there . <p> As we were driving and hiking about northern France , good news came : The University of London 's King 's College had agreed to act as a sponsor for the project , and the Leverhulme Trust grant we had applied for had been approved . I became a senior research fellow of King 's College with a research assistant to help identify the vestiges we found . <p> Anna and I returned to New York in January 1992 to print the several hundred negatives we had made in the first three months of the project . By the time we returned to Europe the following month , we had developed the system that we stuck with for the rest of the project . First we would write ahead of time to the mayors of the townships along the old front line , asking for their help in locating sites . In many cases people had been living for so long next to First World War vestiges that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not think of any when first asked . But a few days or weeks later they would remember , and we would always tell the villagers that we 'd return in a few weeks , then continue back and forth on our itinerary from the North Sea to the Vosges . We did three such round trips along the front , totaling more than twenty thousand miles . <p> As we went along , we stayed in gites ruraux , usually older farmhouses that could be rented by the week . The furnishings were often primitive , but we could walk in with muddy boots and no one was there to object ; we saved time and money by doing our own cooking ; and , most important of all , we could develop our four-by-five negatives each night in the bathroom . <p> Several battlefield experts working alone or with associations were most generous in sharing information with us , and we met men of all ages , some in their twenties , who had spent months exploring , noting , and photographing the remnants in their regions . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it over again . In Aubers , for instance , where more than ninety-five German bunkers had been recorded by the local historical association , it did not make sense to do the job again , and we photographed only some of the most representative vestiges . <p> At no point in the project did we intend to record every single site . For one thing , we limited ourselves to photographing only those vestiges that were visible and identifiable as of World War I origin . Anything built after November 1918 was , with very rare exceptions , left unrecorded . As a rule , we discovered that the more level or fertile an area was , the fewer the remaining vestiges . Picardy and the Somme in particular have very few sites still intact . Agribusiness on an American scale ( France is the secondlargest food exporter in the world ) ensures that practically every square meter of land will be put to good use . But in the Vosges , hills and mountains remain pristine , and barbed-wire entanglements and bunkers are allowed to remain-until forest clearcutting takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war can be especially immediate and affecting : in the pitch-dark mazes of abandoned quarries we found graffiti left by New England doughboys , German grenadiers , French chasseurs , and Welsh tommies . A barn used as a French troop theater still bears the cartoons drawn by an audience of poilus . The remains of a 150-mm howitzer lie in a ravine near Verdun ; in the Aisne large bolts set around a concrete pit mark the position of a giant cannon that fired on Paris , about seventy-five miles away . On an Alsatian mountainside stands an elaborate swimming pool ; built in 1915 for a Bavarian regiment , it even had a boiler to keep the water at a comfortable temperature . Everywhere are monuments large and small , erected by units to honor their dead . Many of these are German , often carefully maintained by the local French municipalit in spite of the old enmity between the two nations . Each year the earth regurgitates tons of shells , grenades , and other lethal hardware . The French and Belgian governments collect this iron harvest and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An enthusiastic tinkerer decides to saw a rusted-out shell in half and blows up with it ; a child plays with a grenade and is maimed . Survivors may be awarded compensation as a " Civilian Victim of the War of 1914-1918 . " <p> With the passing away of the last veterans , the War to End All Wars fades from human memory into the realm of history . A warship named Belleau Wood still cruises under the Stars and Stripes ; reserve and active units still bear their old World War I names of Rainbow Division , or Harlem Hellfighters ; in town squares stand monuments engraved with strange , forgotten names . But soon nobody will remember Cantigny and Chateau Thierry , Langemarck and the Hartmannsweilerkopf . It is all the more important , then , that we never forget what this vanished generation did there . <p> PHOTO : In a corner of the Argonne Forest fiercely contested by the French and Germans in the war 's first year , the zigzag trenches still yield tip the debris of battle , including the dud shell in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French engineer stationed in the sector , the " elephant head " pillbox adds its ominous snout to the grim topography of Verdun . The concrete " trunk " po red over a cast-steel core ensured that a direct hit could destroy only one of the two machine guns within . <p> PHOTO : The carvings in the soft limestone of a quarry near Nanteuil-La-Fosse are the work of the New Englanders of the 103d Infantry Regiment , stationed there in February 1918 . Some , like the one at left , reflect the timeless concerns of soldiery , others are specific to the unit . All were done by the light of dim lamps set in niches like the one below the ship . <p> PHOTO : A four-masted schooner : the 103d knew the sea . <p> PHOTOS : This patriotic motif was crisply incised ... while the Indian was impressionistic . <p> PHOTO : Two profiles , both fondly sculpted . <p> PHOTO : F.
