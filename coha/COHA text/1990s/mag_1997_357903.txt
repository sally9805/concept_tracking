On the last evening of his life , as he dined in Sydney , Australia , with his father Kelland and stepmother Susan at the restaurant Flavour of India , Michael Hutchence did not appear to be the sort of alienated rock personality whose despair would overtake him . So spirited was he , in fact , that at one point during dinner he sprang from his chair and pressed a kiss on the lips of the restaurant 's enthralled assistant manager . Later , he would chat amiably with strangers at the bar of the nearby Ritz-Carlton hotel , where he was staying , and keep the daiquiris and Moet flowing until 4 a.m. for an actress friend he invited to his suite . <P> Eight hours later , however , the 37-year-old lead vocalist of the once top-selling band INXS was found naked and dead , hanging by his neck from a belt attached to the self-closing mechanism of the door to his hotel room . Hutchence , a new father about to embark with his band on their 20th-anniversary tour last Tuesday , had apparently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are finding almost incomprehensible . " Everyone felt that if someone had called us and said , ' Michael overdosed , ' we would have said , ' Jesus , we saw that coming 10 years ago , ' " explained Ed St. John , a former editor of Australian Rolling Stone and a friend of the singer 's . " If he 'd crashed his motorbike off a cliff , we would have said , ' Yeah , that 's Michael . ' But the suicide is the hardest part to understand . I 've never seen him depressed . " That irrepressibility may have fueled one early theory about the cause of death : autoerotic asphyxiation . It seemed in keeping with his quest for thrills and new sensations . <P> The Australian police , however , dismissed the notion , and signs of inner pain quickly emerged . A bottle of Prozac , the antidepressant , was found in the singer 's hotel room . And on his last night , his father Kelland saw a young man in some turmoil . Professionally , Hutchence had watched INXS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young rockers like Noel Gallagher of Oasis dismissing him as a has-been . During dinner at Flavour of India , the elder Hutchence told Michael , " Son , I 'm worried about you . " The singer replied that he was " fine , " but barely touched his food , opting for countless Marlboro Lights instead . But Hutchence did seem to need an ear . At approximately 8 o'clock on the morning he died , he reportedly left a distraught message on the answering machine of a former girlfriend , Michelle Bennett , telling her he needed to talk . When she arrived at his hotel room soon afterward , she knocked on the door but got no response , and returned home . Hotel security later found Hutchence 's body .
