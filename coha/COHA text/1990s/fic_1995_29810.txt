Dedi 1994 and circa 1943 She is plucking her bird of paradise of its dead branches , leaning around the plant every time she hears a car . The woman will never find the old house behind the hedge of towering hibiscus at the bend of the dirt road . Not a gringa dominicana in a rented car with a road map asking for street names ! Dedi had taken the call over at the little museum this morning . Could the woman please come over and talk to Dedi about the Mirabal sisters ? She is originally from here but has lived many years in the States , for which she is sorry since her Spanish is not so good . The Mirabal sisters are not known there , for which she is also sorry for it is a crime that they should be forgotten , these unsung heroines of the underground , et cetera . Oh dear , another one . Now after thirty-four years , the commemorations and interviews and presentations of posthumous honors have almost stopped , so that for months at a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But she 's long since resigned herself to Novembers . Every year as the 25th rolls around , the television crews drive up . There 's the obligatory interview . Then , the big celebration over at the museum , the delegations from as far away as Peru andParaguay , an ordeal really , making that many little party sandwiches and the nephews and nieces not always showing up in time to help . But this is March , ! Marma Santmsima ! Does n't she have seven more months of anonymity ? " How about this afternoon ? I do have a later commitment , " Dedi lies to the voice . She has to . Otherwise , they go on and on , asking the most impertinent questions . There is a veritable racket of gratitude on the other end , and Dedi has to smile at some of the imported nonsense of this woman 's Spanish . " I am so compromised , " she is saying , " by the openness of your warm manner . " " So if I 'm coming from Santiago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Exactamente . And then where you see a great big anacahuita tree , you turn left . " " A ... great ... big ... tree ... , " the woman repeats . She is writing all this down ! " I turn left . What 's the name of the street ? " " It 's just the road by the anacahuita tree . We do n't name them , " Dedi says , driven to doodling to contain her impatience . On the back of an envelope left beside the museum phone , she has sketched an enormous tree , laden with flowers , the branches squirreling over the flap . " You see , most of the campesinos around here ca n't read , so it would n't do us any good to put names on the roads . " The voice laughs , embarrassed . " Of course . You must think I 'm so outside of things . " Tan afuera de la cosa . Dedi bites her lip . " Not at all , " she lies . " I 'll see you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the voice wants to know . Oh yes . The gringos need a time . But there is n't a clock time for this kind of just-right moment . " Any time after three or three-thirty , four-ish . " " Dominican time , eh ? " The woman laughs . " ! Exactamente ! " Finally , the woman is getting the hang of how things are done here . Even after she has laid the receiver in its cradle , Dedi goes on elaborating the root system of her anacahuita tree , shading the branches , and then for the fun of it , opening and closing the flap of the envelope to watch the tree come apart and then back together again . * * * In the garden , Dedi is surprised to hear the radio in the outdoor kitchen announce that it is only three o'clock . She has been waiting expectantly since after lunch , tidying up the patch of garden this American woman will be able to see from the galerma . This is certainly one reason why Dedi shies from these interviews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her life as if it were an exhibit labeled neatly for those who can read : THE SISTER WHO SURVIVED . Usually , if she works it right-a lemonade with lemons from the tree Patria planted , a quick tour of the house the girls grew up in-usually they leave , satisfied , without asking the prickly questions that have left Dedi lost in her memories for weeks at a time , searching for the answer . Why , they inevitably ask in one form or another , why are you the one who survived ? She bends to her special beauty , the butterfly orchid she smuggled back from Hawaii two years ago . For three years in a row Dedi has won a trip , the prize for making the most sales of anyone in her company Her niece Minou has noted more than once the irony of Dedi 's " new " profession , actually embarked upon a decade ago , after her divorce . She is the company 's top life insurance salesperson . Everyone wants to buy a policy from the woman who just missed being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? The slamming of a car door startles Dedi . When she calms herself she finds she has snipped her prize butterfly orchid . She picks up the fallen blossom and trims the stem , wincing . Perhaps this is the only way to grieve the big things-in snippets , pinches , little sips of sadness . But really , this woman should shut car doors with less violence . Spare an aging woman 's nerves . And I 'm not the only one , Dedi thinks . Any Dominican of a certain generation would have jumped at that gunshot sound . * * * She walks the woman quickly through the house , Mama 's bedroom , mine and Patria 's , but mostly mine since Patria married so young , Minerva and Marma Teresa 's . The other bedroom she does not say was her father 's after he and Mama stopped sleeping together . There are the three pictures of the girls , old favorites that are now emblazoned on the posters every November , making these once intimate snapshots seem too famous to be the sisters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vase on the little table below them . She still feels guilty about not continuing Mama 's tribute of a fresh blossom for the girls every day But the truth is , she does n't have the time anymore , with a job , the museum , a household to run . You ca n't be a modern woman and insist on the old sentimentalities . And who was the fresh orchid for , anyway ? Dedi looks up at those young faces , and she knows it is herself at that age she misses the most . The interview woman stops before the portraits , and Dedi waits for her to ask which one was which or how old they were when these were taken , facts Dedi has at the ready , having delivered them so many times . But instead the thin waif of a woman asks , " And where are you ? " Dedi laughs uneasily It 's as if the woman has read her mind . " I have this hallway just for the girls , " she says . Over the woman 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her room ajar , her nightgown flung with distressing abandon on her bed . She wishes she had gone through the house and shut the doors to the bedrooms . " No , I mean , where are you in the sequence , the youngest , the oldest ? " So the woman has not read any of the articles or biographies around . Dedi is relieved . This means that they can spend the time talking about the simple facts that give Dedi the illusion that hers was just an ordinary family , too-birthdays and weddings and new babies , the peaks in that graph of normalcy . Dedi goes through the sequence . " So fast in age , " the woman notes , using an awkward phrase . Dedi nods . " The first three of us were born close , but in other ways , you see , we were so different . " " Oh ? " the woman asks . " Yes , so different . Minerva was always into her wrongs and rights . " Dedi realizes she is speaking to the picture of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pinning her down with a handful of adjectives , the beautiful , intelligent , high-minded Minerva . " And Maria Teresa , ay , Dios , " Dedi sighs , emotion in her voice in spite of herself . " Still a girl when she died , pobrecita , just turned twenty-five . " Dedi moves on to the last picture and rights the frame . " Sweet Patria , always her religion was so important . " " Always ? " the woman says , just the slightest challenge in her voice . " Always , " Dedi affirms , used to this fixed , monolithic language around interviewers and mythologizers of her sisters . " Well , almost always . " * * * She walks the woman out of the house into the galerma where the rocking chairs wait . A kitten lies recklessly under the runners , and she shoos it away " What is it you want to know ? " Dedi asks bluntly . And then because the question does seem to ruddy call the woman to account for herself , she adds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The woman laughs as she says , " Tell me all of it . " Dedi looks at her watch as a polite reminder to the woman that the visit is circumscribed . " There are books and articles . I could have Tono at the museum show you the letters and diaries . " " That would be great , " the woman says , staring at the orchid Dedi is still holding in her hand . Obviously , she wants more . She looks up , shyly . " I just have to say , it 's really so easy to talk to you . I mean , you 're so open and cheerful How do you keep such a tragedy from taking you under ? I 'm not sure I am explaining myself ? " Dedi sighs . Yes , the woman is making perfect sense . She thinks of an article she read at the beauty salon , by a Jewish lady who survived a concentration camp . " There were many many happy years . I remember those . I try anyhow . I tell myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minou tells me I am doing some transcending meditation , something like that . She took the course in the capital . " I 'll tell myself , Dedi , in your memory it is such and such a day , and I start over , playing the happy moment in my head . This is my movies-I have no television here . " " It works ? " " Of course , " Dedi says , almost fiercely . And when it does n't work , she thinks , I get stuck playing the same bad moment . But why speak of that . " Tell me about one of those moments , " the woman asks , her face naked with curiosity . She looks down quickly as if to hide it . Dedi hesitates , but her mind is already racing backwards , year by year by year , to the moment she has fixed in her memory as zero . * * * She remembers a clear moonlit night before the future began . They are sitting in the cool darkness under the anacahuita tree in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drinking guanabana juice . Good for the nerves , Mama always says . They 're all there , Mama , Papa , Patria-Minerva-Dedi . Bang-bang-bang , their father likes to joke , aiming a finger pistol at each one , as if he were shooting them , not boasting about having sired them . Three girls , each born within a year of the other ! And then , nine years later , Marma Teresa , his final desperate attempt at a boy misfiring . Their father has his slippers on , one foot hooked behind the other . Every once in a while Dedi hears the clink of the rum bottle against the rim of his glass . Many a night , and this night is no different , a shy voice calls out of the darkness , begging their pardon . Could they spare a calmante for a sick child out of their stock of kindness ? Would they have some tobacco for a tired old man who spent the day grating yucca ? Their father gets up , swaying a little with drink and tiredness , and opens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medicine , a couple of cigars , a few mints for the godchildren . Dedi tells her father that she does n't know how they do as well as they do , the way he gives everything away . But her father just puts his arm around her , and says , " Ay , Dedi , that 's why I have you . Every soft foot needs a hard shoe . " She 'll bury us all , " her father adds , laughing , " in silk and pearls . " Dedi hears again the clink of the rum bottle . " Yes , for sure , our Dedi here is going to be the millionaire in the family . " " And me , Papa , and me ? " Marma Teresa pipes up in her little girl 's voice , not wanting to be left out of the future . " You , mi qapita , you 'll be our little coquette . You 'll make a lot of men 's - " Their mother coughs her correcting-your-manners cough . " -a lot of men 's mouths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At eight years old , in her long braids and checkered blouse , the only future the baby wants is one that will make her own mouth water , sweets and gifts in big boxes that clatter with something fun inside when she shakes them . " What of me , Papa ? " Patria asks more quietly It is difficult to imagine Patria unmarried without a baby on her lap , but Dedi 's memory is playing dolls with the past . She has sat them down that clear , cool night before the future begins , Mama and Papa and their four pretty girls , no one added , no one taken away Papa calls on Mama to help him out with his fortune-telling . Especially-though he does n't say this-if she 's going to censor the clairvoyance of his several glasses of rum . " What would you say , Mama , about our Patria ? " " You know , Enrique , that I do n't believe in fortunes , " Mama says evenly . " Padre Ignacio says fortunes are for those without faith . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the distance that will come between her parents . Looking back , she thinks , Ay , Mama , ease up a little on those commandments . Work out the Christian math of how you give a little and you get it back a hundredfold . But thinking about her own divorce , Dedi admits the math does n't always work out . If you multiply by zero , you still get zero , and a thousand heartaches . " I do n't believe in fortunes either , " Patria says quickly She 's as religious as Mama , that one . " But Papa is n't really telling fortunes . " Minerva agrees . " Papa 's just confessing what he thinks are our strengths . " She stresses the verb confessing as if their father were actually being pious in looking ahead for his daughters . " Is n't that so , Papa ? " " Sm , seqorita , " Papa burps , slurring his words . It 's almost time to go in . " Also , " Minerva adds , " Padre Ignacio condemns fortunes only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can know . " That one ca n't leave well enough alone . " Some of us know it all , " Mama says curtly . Marma Teresa defends her adored older sister . " It is n't a sin , Mama , it is n't . Berto and Razl have this game from New York . Padre Ignacio played it with us . It 's a board with a little glass you move around , and it tells the future ! " Everybody laughs , even their mother , for Marma Teresa 's voice is bursting with gullible excitement . The baby stops , suddenly , in a pout . Her feelings get hurt so easily On Minerva 's urging , she goes on in a little voice . " I asked the talking board what I would be when I grew up , and it said a lawyer . "
