Morse locked in an empty room or cell . Alone . She wears a dirty , tattered , but once fine , dress . She stands center stage with the dress pulled up to hide her face . She is wearing a torn pair of boys britches or long underwear under her dress . She is just barely visible in the dim light . She repeats the words that her interrogator might have used earlier . MORSE What are you doing out of your grave ? ( Beat ) What are you doing out of your grave ? ( Beat ) Speak to me . ( We hear the sound of someone being slapped , but Morse remains still and does not react . ) Speak to me , girl , or you 'll stay here ' til it 's known . ( Another sound of a slap , harder . Morse still does not move . ) What happened to the gentleman ? ( Another slap . ) What happened to his wife ? ( Another slap . ) Whose blood is on your sleeve ? ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her face . ) The blood of a fish . Is on my sleeve . Because . The fish . The fish were burning in the channels . Whole schools of them on fire . And the ships sailing and their hulls plowing the dead up out of the water . And the war had begun . The war with the Dutch had begun . ( Beat ) It was March . No , it was later . In summer . A summer so hot vegetables stewed in their crates . The old and the sick melted like snow in the streets . At night the rats came out in twos and threes to drink the sweat from our faces . ( Beat ) And it had finally come . ( Beat ) The Visitation . We all went to sleep one morning and when we awoke the whole city was aglow with the fever . Sparrows fell dead from the sky into the hands of beggars . Dogs walked in the robes of dying men , slipped into the beds of their dead masters ' wives . Children were born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were locked in their own house , the two of them . All the windows , but one , nailed shut from the outside . They 'd waited out their time of confinement . Three more days and they could escape.But then we came . In through the basement and across the roofs.One of us died . In that room . Two of us died . ( Beat ) It was night . Yes . At night . He moved as though invisible . Gliding through the empty streets . ( Bunce , making a fair amount of noise , tumbles into the cell , which has now become the Snelgraves ' room . He stands facing into a corner . ) He came in through the cellar . He thought the house was empty and so he made himself at home . ( Snelgrave and Darcy enter their bare room . ) But his timing was off . Mr. and Mrs. Snelgrave caught him in the act of relieving himself into one of their finest vases . ( Morse joins the scene , but hides in the corner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Snelgraves ' house . Bunce is looking over his shoulder at the Snelgraves , who remain in the shadows , almost invisible. ) p. 3 BUNCE ( Producing the vase , with a genuine embarrassment ) : Thought I 'd . Save my piss . It 's got rum in it . Might be the last I 'll have for weeks . p. 4 Act 1 , Scene 2 SCENE TWO Lights up on the Snelgraves ' room . Morse is still hiding . Snelgrave and Darcy jump back , terrified of contact with Bunce . BUNCE I 'm a poor man looking for shelter . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE My God ! Lord have mercy on us ! BUNCE I thought everyone died in this house . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE Help ! Someone help us ! BUNCE Shhh . I mean no harm . MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE He 's relieved himself . In my vase . ( Bunce holds out the vase , offering to give it back to her . ) Get out of our house . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE He has the infection ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He stinks . And sick . Look at his eyes . BUNCE I 'm not sick . Just hungry . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE The guards . What if they saw you enter ? MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE They have no mercy ; it 's the law . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE Open your shirt . Stay ! Open ! Prove there 's no marks on you . ( Bunce opens his shirt . With his cane , Snelgrave pokes at Bunce , moving the shirt this way and that to have a better look . We see a bandage around Bunce 's waist and a spot of blood . ) What ? There 's blood . My God ! Blood ! p. 5 BUNCE It 's years old . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE ( Brandishing his cane ) : Get back ! Get back ! BUNCE Still bleeds . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE Your arms , then . Show us your arms ! ( Bunce pulls up his sleeves and Snelgrave examines his arms . ) No other marks . He 's clean . ( Morse comes out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MORSE I am Morse Braithwaite . MR .

DARCY SNELGRAVE Sir Nevill Braithwaite and his wife . We know them . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE Dead of the plague last Tuesday . Man , wife and daughter . MORSE It 's true my father fell on me in a fit of fever , and there I lay beneath him for two nights and a day . It 's terrible to smell such things from a father . But I finally dug my way from under him and up on the roofs I went . To hide . To hide from the plague . I saw no light in this house . I came in through the window . I 'm not a thief . p. 6 MR .

Have a good sleep , did you ? It stinks in here , it does . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE We 've washed the floors with vinegar . KABE And stripped the room bare , I see . Well , the less the nasty has to hide in . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE We 've boarded up the other rooms , except for the kitchen . KABE Ah . Shame it is . Such fine rooms , some of the finest in town maybe , empty but for stink . Bit cramped this one though ? MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE This is the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ah yes . Two maids and a houseboy , carted and pitted . And the canary too , Mrs. Snelgrave ? ( Makes the sound of a canary ) Shame . ( Beat ) Will you be needing any provisions from the market this morning , madame ? Plenty of corn but cheese there 's none . Butter , none . Some fruit but it 's got the hairs . MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE No , thank you , Kabe . That will be all . KABE The whole town 's living on onions . You can smell it in the evenings . It 's all that farting that 's killed the birds . ( Sound of hammering on boards . ) DARCY AND SNELGRAVE Kabe ? KABE Sorry . Fellow across the way saw you let in a couple of guests last night . MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE No . No . MR .

WILLIAM SNELGRAVE Alive , damn you , for almost four weeks ! We are clean ! KABE Sorry . BUNCE ( Appearing ) : Then why did n't you lot try and stop us ? KABE Not our job . We 're just the guards . We make sure no one gets out . If they get in , well , that 's just luck . So , twenty-eight days again for the lot of you . Just enough time to get snug . I do n't mind . I like this house . Pretty as a bird , it is , heh , Darcy ? ( Tweets again ) MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE How dare you ! KABE Does stink , though . I get paid twice as much to guard a proper house like this.Could I have one of your gloves today , Mistress ? Wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrieks with laughter . ) MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE I 'll have you in the stocks when I 'm out of here , Kabe . KABE I 've been wanting to ask her that for years . Never could ' til now . ( To Morse ) Why do n't you ask her ? Ask her to show you her pretty , white neck ! ( Sings ) One o'clock , two o'clock , three o'clock , four , here 's a red cross for your door.Where 's my enemy ? Flown to the country ! Never mind that , coz p. 9 MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE Someone should shoot him . KABE ( Continues singing ) : One o'clock , two o'clock , three o'clock , four , I 've got the key to your locked door ! ( Kabe shrieks again with laughter and is gone . ) MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE Come here , child . ( Morse approaches him . Snelgrave slaps her . ) You would have been better off if you 'd stayed put . Sir Braithwaite 's daughter does n't climb over roofs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father is dead . Give me your hand . In the Snelgrave house , we behave like Christians . Therefore , we will love you as one of our own . MORSE Why ? ( Darcy takes the girl 's other hand and the three of them stand together . Bunce stands alone . ) MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE Because you 're one of us. p. 10 Act 1 , Scene 3 SCENE THREE Bunce sitting alone in the bare room . A key turns in the lock , and an apple rolls across the stage toward him . He picks it up , smells it with ecstasy . Snelgrave enters . BUNCE I have n't seen one of these in weeks . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE Something special I have Kabe bring in now and then . BUNCE The three of you in the kitchen ? MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE For the time being . ( Bunce holds up the apple , admires it , then begins to eat . ) I 'm not a cruel man , Bunce . But even under these conditions I ca n't just let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my protection . The problem is you have the only suitable room in the house because it has a door that I can lock and now we must sleep on the kitchen floor . ( Beat ) And you smell awfully . BUNCE It 's the tar , sir . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE Ah-ha ! A sailor . I knew it ! It keeps the water out , the tar . And your buttons , of cheese or bone ? BUNCE Wood , sir . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE That 's unusual . I know a bit about the waters myself . I work for the Navy Board , just down the lane , on Seething . My friend Samuel and I , we control the largest commercial venture in the country , hmm . The Royal Dockyards. p. 11 BUNCE They 're as good as closed , sir . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE That 's the curse of this plague . It 's stopped all trade . There 's not a merchant ship that 's left the main port in months . Rats eating at the silks , damp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selling spice and nutmeg on the streets . And starving . The lot of you . ( Bunce eats the apple core as well . ) BUNCE I sailed three cats and a hag before we unloaded at the main port . Half of the crew got sick and died . A crowd set fire to three flys unloading beside our rig . They said the ships were carrying the plague . The crew had to swim to shore . Those that were n't burned . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE What were your routes ? Did you ship to Calcutta ? Bombay ? BUNCE Green waters of the Caribbean and back , mostly . Green water , green islands , green air , and all the colors of Port Royal . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE Port Royal . They say the women there are masculine and obscene . BUNCE Salt-Beef Peg . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE Your wife , certainly ? BUNCE Not married . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE ( Enjoying this ) : Shameful. p. 12 BUNCE She had nothing on Buttock-de-Clink Jenny . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE Not in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sour as ah well . Sorry , sir . There 's not a lot of good memories a sailor has , and them he has he carries tucked deep in . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE I 've heard the stories at the coffeehouse . You know , I often dream of the sea but if I step my foot in a boat , the world goes black before my eyes . My body ca n't abide it , but my heart . Well . ( Beat ) I 'm a rich man , Bunce , and you a common sailor yet  --  look at the two of us  --  we have the sea between us . The struggle , the daring , the wrath . Cathay 's lake of rubies . The North-West passage . Ice monsters fouling the sea  --  that angry bitch that 'll tear you limb from limb . Man against the elements . BUNCE Mostly for us sailors it was man against the captain . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE ( Begins to rock back and forth , eyes closed , living in the moment of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blow like a madness and the sea leaps up like a continuous flame . The hideous , howling wilderness that stabs at the hull , that would rend flesh from bone . Sea spouts the size of cities . The cargo shifting and tumbling below deck and water casks rolling from side to side . One terrible cry after another pierces the air as the crew is swept overboard . ( Snelgrave motions for Bunce to stand beside him and rock back and forth with him . After some initial hesitation , Bunce does so . ) To lessen the resistance to the fiendish wind and keep her from capsizing , three of our best crawl on deck with axes and climb aloft to cut away the fore topmast and the bowsprit ropes . p. 13 BUNCE And as they hack at the mast , a monstrous wave , three times the size of the rig , whacks the starboard and snaps the foremast like a stick , and carries it with one of the sailors into the sea . The second is crushed MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE ( Continues for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ship . BUNCE The third is hung by his boot in the ratline . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE The sea has no mercy and smashes all who try to rule her beneath her foul and lecherous waves . BUNCE Smashing , smashing . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE Smashing the small vessel like eggshells against a stone . Oh death , death , death . ( Snelgrave whacks his stick on the floor furiously a few times . ) And scurvy . Did you get the scurvy ? BUNCE Many a time . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE Knots . You can do knots ? ( Takes out a piece of rope and knots it ) What 's that ? BUNCE That 's a bowline . But your tail 's too short . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE Is it ? ( Bunce takes the rope and reties the knot . ) Hmmm . Show me another . ( Bunce does a series of knots , one after the other , as they speak. ) p. 14 BUNCE Butterfly knot . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE ( Indicating a scar on Bunce 's neck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Main pirates ? ! BUNCE ( Another knot ) : Lighterman 's hitch . ( Meaning his neck ) Sail hook . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE In a drunken brawl ? BUNCE We were a short ways outside Gravesend . Our fly was carrying sugar and rum . The press gangs were looking for fresh recruits and boarded us just as we came into port . ( Another knot ) Half hitch with seizing . ( Beat ) To keep from the press , sometimes we 'd cut ourselves a wound and then burn it with vitriol . Make it look like scurvy . They wanted whole men , so I stuck myself in the neck with a sail hook . They passed me over when they saw the blood . ( Snelgrave hands Bunce some nuts . Bunce eats . Snelgrave watches him eat. ) p. 15 Act 1 , Scene 4 SCENE FOUR Morse , Bunce , Darcy and Snelgrave in their room . Darcy reads , but more often just stares . Snelgrave sits with an unopened book . Morse sits and stares . Bunce sits in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A sense of boredom , tedium , inside a house where no one can leave . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE Did you vinegar the corner , under your mat , as well , Bunce ? BUNCE Yes I did , sir . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE Right . ( Long silence . ) The chairs as well ? BUNCE Yes , sir . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE Right . MORSE ( Sings ) : Over and across the tall , tall grassThey lay my love in the dirtHe was just a kid and myself a lassIf it 'd bring him back , I 'd reconvert . ( Snelgrave whacks his cane . ) MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE Not in this house . MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE Oh , let her sing . MORSE ( Continues ) : O fire of the devil , fire of loveThe truth is a lie and the pig 's a dove . p. 16 MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE She does n't sing like a Christian child . MORSE ( Continues ) : The desert is cold and Hell is hotThe mouth that kisses is sweet with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've heard song in this house since  --  MORSE Ca n't you sing ? MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE I do n't like to . But I like to hear it . Sometimes . MORSE Are you not hot in all that dress ? MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE No , child . I never wear anything but this sort of dress . MORSE Can I see your neck ? MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE What ? Why , child ? MORSE Because I think you must have a beautiful neck and it 's the time of the plague and there 's not much of beauty left in this city but you . MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE Who taught you to lie so kindly ? MORSE Learned it myself . Can I see ? MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE I will get you a looking glass and you can look at your own neck , which is lovely . Mine is not . I am old . p. 17 MORSE Please . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE Leave my wife in peace . MORSE Let me see . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE Sit back down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hangman about your neck . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE I said leave her be . MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE She means no harm . MORSE Or perhaps the finger marks of someone who hates you . MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE ( Laughing ) : Perhaps the hole of a sword that went in here and came out there ! MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE Must you encourage such putrid imaginings ? Enough . My head hurts from it . ( Snelgrave exits the room . ) MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE Stand here , child . ( Morse nears her . ) Closer . Let me feel your breath on my cheek . ( Morse moves closer . ) The breath of a child has passed through the lungs of an angel . That 's what they-say . MORSE My mother said to me that once a tiny piece of star broke off and fell from the sky while she slept in a field of wheat and it pierced her , here ( Motions to Darcy 's heart but does n't touch her ) and from that piece of star I was born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What did he say ? That he molded you from a sliver of moon ? MORSE My father is dead . MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE I know . But what did he say about his little girl ? MORSE My father was born dead . He stayed that way most of his life . MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE I met your father , at the opera , once . He seemed a decent man . MORSE My father hit the maids . I saw him do it . Sometimes twice a day . MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE Well , then , he kept order . A household must have order . MORSE He used a piece of leg from a chair . He kept it in the drawer of his writing desk . MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE Sometimes servants misbehave . That 's not your father 's fault . MORSE Do you hit your servants ? MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE My servants are dead . MORSE Did you hit them ? MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE No , I did n't . But when they did not listen , I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MORSE Can I see your neck now ? p. 19 MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE No , you can not . MORSE Can I see your hands ? MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE My hands are private . MORSE I 'm not afraid to die . MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE You do n't have to be ; you wo n't die . MORSE I already know what it 's like . To be dead . It 's nothing fancy . ( Morse moves away from Darcy . She takes the hem of her dress in her hands . ) Just lots of nothing to see all around you and nothing to feel , only there 's a sound that comes and goes . Comes and goes . Like this : ( She slowly tears a rip in her dress , up to her waist . ) Have you heard that sound before , Mrs. Snelgrave ? ( Darcy does not answer . Morse speaks now to Bunce . ) And you , sitting there on your lily pad like a frog ? Have you heard it ? BUNCE In Northumberland . Yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kid . We heard all sorts of things down in the earth . And when our lanterns went out , our minds went to Hell . MORSE Did lots of you die down there ? MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE Morse . BUNCE Lost my baby brother in the mines . Well , he was n't a baby , but he always was to us . Just thirteen , he was . We went deep for the coal . They kept pushing us . Pushing us deeper . The ceilings were half down most of the time . One fell in on top of us , six of us it were . p. 20 MORSE Your brother was crushed ? BUNCE Yes , he was . And the master , he kicked me ' cause I was cursing the mine . I jumped him and his men pulled me off . He kicked me again and I bit his ear in two . One of his guards popped a knife in my side . Never healed up right . MORSE What did he look like crushed up ? Your brother . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He looked like . Well . His face was the only part of him . Not crushed . His face looked . I do n't know . What ? Disappointed . I think . MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE That 's enough . MORSE ( To Bunce ) : And his body ? BUNCE His body . It was like . What ? Like water . What was left of him . I could n't take him up in my arms . He just . Spilled away . ( Morse nears Bunce , kneels down and simply looks at him . After some moments , Bunce looks away from her and at Darcy. ) p. 21 Act 1 , Scene 5 SCENE FIVE Outside of the Snelgraves ' house . Just below the window . Kabe is guarding the house . KABE ( Calls ) : Bills . The Bills . Stepney Parish , seven hundred and sixteen . White-Chapel , three hundred forty-six . The Bills . St. Giles 's Cripplegate , two hundred seventy-seven .

MORSE We 're all right . KABE You a relative ? MORSE Mrs. Snelgrave says you 're a thief . KABE Does she now ? And how old are you , sweetheart ? MORSE Twelve . Mr. Snelgrave says you 're the worst sort of rabble . KABE We 're always rabble , we are , when we come out from our alleys and lanes and rub shoulders with Snelgraves , hawk an innocent gob o ' phlegm on their doorstep . They 're not much company , how ' bout you ? MORSE Mr. Snelgrave says you 're not much above vermin . p. 22 KABE Does he now ? And have you ever seen a little mousie ? MORSE I seen rats . KABE Ever had a sweetheart ? ( Morse shakes her head no . ) Doctors say virgins ripe for marriage are ripe for the infection , their blood being hot and their seed pining for copulation . MORSE Mr. Snelgrave says you want us to die . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could show you a jewel that 'd change your life . MORSE Go ahead then . KABE Do n't know if you 're grown enough . MORSE I 'm old on the inside . Show me . KABE Hold onto that window . ( Kabe stands directly under her and opens his pants . Morse looks . And looks . ) Well ! ! MORSE You 're a man , then ? KABE Of course I 'm a man . A bull of a man . A whale of a man . MORSE Sometimes people pretend . KABE ( Closing his pants ) : What you just saw was n't pretending . MORSE Do n't like all the strawy hairs on it . p. 23 KABE Have you no manners , you prince 's whore ? You should be beaten . Have you ever been beaten ? MORSE ( Laughing at him ) : Lots of times . Can you get me a Certificate of Health from the Lord Mayor so I can pass out of the city ? KABE ( Shrieks with laughter ) : You 're a card , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KABE He 's no longer in town . MORSE Yes he is . Lord Mayor of London . He 's the only one who stayed . KABE Not counting the poor , child . The poor 's all stayed . And what I hear tell , that 's not the mayor in the mayor 's house but a madman who broke in and jumps naked through the garden , cawing like a crow at night . The rest of the court 's gone too . All that 's got wealth has fled from the plague . And God 's followed them . MORSE The Snelgraves have n't fled . KABE That 's not for trying . They just got unlucky ; their servants died before they could leave ' em behind to starve . MORSE Get me a Certificate so I can pass the blockades . KABE I got ahold of a few of those papers at the very start , but now . Well . They 're as rare as And what would you give me in return ? p. 24 MORSE Do n't have much .

I know an old man who 's got a bucketful . MORSE Got no money . KABE I 'll make you a deal . You let me , ah , kiss your foot and for every kiss I 'll get you a sugar knot . MORSE Deal . ( Kabe kisses her foot , twice . Then sucks on her big toe . Morse kicks him . ) You said kiss , not suck . KABE What 's the difference ? MORSE An apple . A suck is worth an apple . KABE Thief .

I feel it in me shins . MORSE Then I 'll be good at being dead . My father and mother are already dead . Poor Daddy . Poor Mommy . Dead , dead , dead . KABE Stupid brat . What you lack is fear . This past week , I got the bodies piled so high in my cart I could hardly see over the tops of them . ( Beat ) Hey . I know an old woman who 's got tangerines , still good , that she wears under her skirts . She says they stay fresh down there because she 's hot as the tropics . MORSE Get me a tangerine too .

But if you crawl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep well this night . MORSE Perhaps I 'll kill you first .

We 'll all meet in the graveThen we 'll all get laid down Oh , down , deep down . p. 26 p. 27 Act 1 , Scene 6 SCENE SIX Bunce washes the floor with vinegar . He uses a small rag and a bucket . Snelgrave watches him . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE I heard the crier this morning . The Bills have almost doubled this week . Mostly the Out-Parishes of the poor . But it 's moving this way . A couple of persons I know personally have died . Decent people . Good Christians on the surface . But there 's the key . On the surface . When the poor die , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their faces and you 'll see their bitter hearts . When the rich die , it 's harder to tell why God took them ; they 're clean , attend the Masses , give alms . But something rotten lurks . Mark my words , Bunce . A fine set of clothes does not always attest to a fine set of morals . ( Bunce , wiping the floors , nears Snelgrave 's shoes . ) Are you afraid , Bunce ? BUNCE Sir ? MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE Are you afraid of the plague ? BUNCE Who is n't , sir ? MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE It is written in the Ninety-First Psalm of the Book : " Thou shalt not be afraid for the pestilence that walketh in darkness A thousand shall fall at thy side , and ten thousand at thy right hand : but it shall not come nigh thee . " That does n't mean I do n't ever doubt , Bunce . I use vinegar . p. 28 BUNCE Those are fine shoes , sir . The finest I ever saw this close up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silk suit . A bit tight on my corns , but real gentlemen 's leather . I would wager your life , Bunce , that you 'll never wear such fine shoes as these . BUNCE I 'd wager two of my lives , if I had them . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE A little learning , Bunce : patterns will have it that you , a poor sailor , will never wear such shoes as these . And yet , the movement of history , which is as inflexible as stone , can suddenly change . With a flick of a wrist . Or , I might say , an ankle . Watch while I demonstrate . ( Slips out of his shoes ) Put them on , Bunce . BUNCE Sir ? MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE Put my shoes on your feet . BUNCE My feet are dirty , sir . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE Then have my socks on first . ( Bunce holds up the fine socks and examines them . ) Go on , then . ( Bunce carefully slips on the socks , then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back and forth at their feet . Snelgrave wiggles his bare toes . ) Now , Bunce . What do you see ? p. 29 BUNCE I see the master is without shoes . And his new servant . He is wearing very fine shoes . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE And history ? What does history tell you now ? BUNCE Not sure how that works , sir . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE Historically speaking , the poor do not take to fine shoes . They never have and they never will . BUNCE I 'm wearing fine shoes now . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE Yes , but only because I allow it . I have given history a wee slap on the buttocks and for a moment something terribly strange has happened : you in my shoes . However , what we see here is not real . It 's an illusion because I ca n't change the fact that you 'll never wear fine shoes . BUNCE But I 'm wearing them now , sir . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE Only because I gave them to you . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then history will be on course again . As a matter of fact , it never strayed from course , because what we 're doing here is just a little game . BUNCE What if I kept the shoes ? MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE Kept them ? You ca n't keep them . They 're mine . BUNCE I know they 're yours , sir . I 'm just asking what if I kept them ? p. 30 MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE That 's not a historical question . BUNCE No . It 's a game question . You said this was a game , sir . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE So I did . Well , if you kept them I would go and get another pair before my feet got cold . BUNCE Then we 'd both have a pair . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE You 're not attacking the problem correctly . If we both have a pair , how will people tell our feet apart ? They 'll look the same . That 's not history , Bunce , that 's obfuscatory . BUNCE May I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly may not . BUNCE I just want to hold it , sir . It 's finely carved . I 'll never hold a cane like that in my life . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE ( Reluctantly hands it to him ) : I 'm not a cruel man . ( Bunce takes the cane , tucks it awkwardly under his arm . ) Not like that . It 's not a piece of firewood you 're lugging for the stove . ( Snelgrave snatches it back . He delicately tucks it under his arm and walks this way and that . ) BUNCE It does n't look right on you without the shoes , sir . ( Bunce holds out his hand and after a moment 's hesitation , Snelgrave hands the cane to him . Bunce carries the cane almost properly this time. ) p. 31 MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE That 's it . Elbow a bit higher . I always think of it as walking across the hands of children . You must do it lightly and carefully or you 'll break their bones . BUNCE Is this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Certainly not . This is just practice . BUNCE Practice for what ? MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE Brrrrr . My feet are cold . The shoes , please . ( Bunce walks once more to and fro , then stops face to face with Snelgrave , close . Silence for some moments . Bunce hands Snelgrave the cane and removes the shoes , slowly , then the socks . He sets the shoes carefully and neatly between them , laying out the socks one by one . The two men look at the shoes between them . They watch each other some moments , then Bunce returns to his bucket and rag . He cleans . Snelgrave picks up his shoes and socks . ) The Bills are up . Way up this week . We 'll need to vinegar this room twice a day from now on . Starting tomorrow . One ca n't be too cautious . I 'll send my wife in with some bread for you when you 're done . BUNCE Yes , sir . ( Snelgrave begins to exit . ) Sir ? ( Snelgrave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cruel man , either , sir . p. 32 MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE I know that , Bunce . I would n't have taken you on as my servant if I had thought otherwise . ( Snelgrave exits . We hear the lock turn. ) p. 33 Act 1 , Scene 7 SCENE SEVEN Bunce adjusts his wrappings under his shirt . The door is no longer locked , and Darcy enters . She watches him for some moments . He 's unaware and curses the wrappings that are beginning to fall to pieces in his hands . We hear Kabe singing offstage . KABE ( Sings ) : Calico , silk , porcelain , teaIt 's all the same to the poor man and me . BUNCE Ah , fuck the Lord . KABE ( Continues ) : Steal it in the Indies , haul it cross the seaAnd now it 's nothing between the plague , you and me . BUNCE Ow ! Fuck his Angels too . MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE I brought you some clean linen . BUNCE ( Backing into his corner ) : Beg your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE They are . Does it hurt all the time ? BUNCE Only when I sit a lot . On the sea I 'm standing most of the time and I feel best . MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE Here 's a clean shirt . It belonged to our servant boy . I 've soaked it in vinegar and cloves . It 's safe . p. 34 BUNCE ( He takes the shirt ) : Thank you , missus . MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE I brought some clean strips too . So you can rebind it . BUNCE ( He takes them ) : You 're kind . MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE I do n't want blood on my floors . ( They each wait for something from the other . ) BUNCE Perhaps you should go back to the kitchen , missus . MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE I will stay . BUNCE It 's not pretty . ( Darcy does n't leave . Bunce shrugs and painfully takes off his shirt . His old bandage is still in place . He begins to wrap the new one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old one off or it will do no good to put a clean one on . BUNCE It does no good anyhow but make it look better . MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE I will do it . BUNCE No . MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE ( Taking the new bandage from him ) : Yes , I will . BUNCE ( Angry , holding the old bandage in place ) : I said no , missus . p. 35 MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE All right then . Do it yourself . ( She tosses the bandage at his feet so that he must stoop to pick it up . He does so . ) BUNCE ( Wanting her to turn away ) : Please . ( She does so , annoyed . Turning his wound away from her , he rebinds it . We do not see the wound . ) MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE So you 're a sailor . Merchant or Navy ? BUNCE Merchant by choice . Navy by force . MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE Then it 's the sailor 's life for you : drinking , thieving , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Playing into the clich ) : Yeah . Swearing . And once or twice we took hold of our own fucked ship from some goddamned captain . We let our men vote if the bloody prick lived or died . Mostly our men voted he died , so first we whipped and pickled him , then threw the fat gutted chucklehead overboard . And because we could n't piss on his grave we pissed on the bastard 's back as he sank to the sharks below . MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE A tongue that swears does not easily pray . BUNCE The times I was asked by my captain or his mate to beat a fellow tar ? I ca n't count them . The times I refused ? Maybe less than one . ( Some moments of silence. ) p. 36 MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE I 've never sailed on a ship . I married when I was fifteen . ( Beat ) Why did you come to our house ? BUNCE The ships are n't sailing but the Navy 's . I did n't want to get picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it an honor to serve the Navy . BUNCE Ay . Some would . Though I never met them . MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE Do you have a wife ? BUNCE I did for a little while , but I lost her . Was coming into port at Liverpool , merchant ship . Making short trips . Got picked up for the second time to serve His Majesty 's ships . Did n't get back to port for eight months , and then my wife was gone . If she still lives , I do n't know . The neighbors said she raved for months and went mad . Tick fever . But I do n't believe it . She was a smart one . I think she just got tired of waiting and moved on . MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE Did your wife have soft . Skin ? BUNCE Soft skin ? Well , no . It was n't what you 'd call soft . Her father was a ribband weaver and she worked by his side . Her hands were harder than mine . MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 37 MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE Have you never touched a woman 's skin that was soft ? BUNCE Not a woman 's , no . But I met a lad in the port of Bristol once , and he had skin so fine it was like running your fingers through water . MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE You speak against God . BUNCE I 'm speaking of God 's pleasure . MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE ( Picking up the scraps of bandage that Bunce has discarded ) : And his . Breast . Was it smooth as well ? BUNCE His breast . It was . Darker . Like the skin of an apple it smelled , and as smooth . MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE Did you love him ? BUNCE For those few months I loved him better than I could love another in years . His name was Killigrew . We got picked up off the streets and pressed onto the same ship . Warred against the Hollanders . He died . MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE I 'm sorry . BUNCE The bastard . Always had the luck . MRS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When this is over and we 're allowed to leave here , you 'll have these . You 'll be able to eat a while and pay for shelter . They 're real stones . p. 38 BUNCE ( Accepting the earrings ; examining them ) : Why am I to be paid like this ? MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE It 's not payment . It 's charity . BUNCE I 'm poor , missus , but not stupid . If your husband catches me with these I might as well jump into the pits . MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE He wo n't find them if you keep them well hid . BUNCE Hid where ? You keep ' em . When we 're all out and by our own legs , if you still feel moved to charity , you can give them to me once more . ( He hands them back . She puts them on again . ) MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE And this man you loved . Killigrew . Were his BUNCE What . ( Darcy touches her own thighs . Not in a seductive manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say the word out loud . ) MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE Here . Was he smooth here ? BUNCE What do you want , missus ? MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE For you to answer me . BUNCE And if I do n't ? MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE We no longer lock you up . We trust you now . p. 39 BUNCE All right . ( He nears her , close ) Close your eyes . I 'll do you no harm . ( Darcy closes her eyes . Bunce softly blows air across her face . When he stops , she does not open her eyes . ) That 's how it felt to touch him there . ( Some moments of silence . ) MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE I do n't intend to die of the plague , Bunce . My husband has agreed to help me end my life if the tokens appear . BUNCE Not all that gets the plague dies . MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE First the marks appear around the neck or groin . There 's fever . Violent vomiting . The patient can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But if the swelling can be brought to break and run , sometimes a person can live . I saved a friend that way once . Cut the marks with a knife and bled them . He never could speak again , but he lived . MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE No , no . The stench of the sores is unbearable . The body rots . And then the mind . Lunacy and madness is the end . I saw two of our servants die that way . Their screams are locked inside my head forever . BUNCE Would you like to know of any other parts of my lad Killigrew , missus ? p. 40 MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE No . Thank you . I 've heard enough . Just bless the Lord He 's brought you into this house . Against our will , certainly , but I assume not against His . ( Beat ) I could have you hanged for speaking of such matters to a married woman of my position . BUNCE ( Sings ) : Lust in his limbs and rust in his skinA bear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DARCY SNELGRAVE I 'm just an old woman . That 's what you think . Well . Smile as you like . I once had a lover , and his arms were so strong that my skull was crushed in his grip . With his bare hands he plunged between my ribs and took hold of my heart . A wafer between his fingers , it dissolved . Sometimes I wake up in the dark and stand in the hall and I can feel the cold draft pass freely through my chest as though there were nothing there . BUNCE I 'll have those earrings after all . ( Darcy is motionless , as though not hearing him . He gently slips the earrings from her ears . ) I 'll find a place . I 'm a pirate . p. 41 Act 1 , Scene 8 SCENE EIGHT Darcy , Morse and Snelgrave in the room . Morse 's wrists are bound with rope . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE The child 's a thief , I tell you . What did I find in her pockets one morning last week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just playing jacks with them , " she says . She 's got the manners of a servant and the tongue of a who  --  MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE Do n't you dare . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE That brooch belonged to my mother . Not you . The child will confess when I give her some of this . ( Snelgrave brandishes his cane . ) MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE I 'll find the brooch . It 's bound to have fallen when I was turning things out . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE The child will wear those ropes until we find it . MORSE I did n't steal your brooch . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE Hold your tongue . MORSE You belong in a cold , cold grave . ( Snelgrave raises his cane to hit Morse . She runs to hide behind Darcy . ) Help me , Mrs. Snelgrave . MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE You did steal his coins . ( Snelgrave whacks and misses. ) p. 42 MORSE Yes , I did . But you gave Bunce some of his gin . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own eyes , sir . Mrs. Snelgrave thought I was asleep . You were , but I was n't , and she poured some of your gin into a bowl and she took it to him . She watched him drink it . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE Is this true ? MORSE ( Makes the sound ) : Slurp , slurp . MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE He asked me the other day if we might spare some spirits . I said no . Later , I changed my mind . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE In the middle of the night ? MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE I did n't want to wake you . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE ( To Morse ) : And what else did you see , Morse Braithwaite ? ( Morse raises her roped hands to him . After a moment he understands the deal and takes off the ropes . ) MORSE She asked him if the new bandage fit right . He said it felt a bit tight . He asked her to feel it . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE He asked her to feel what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 43 MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE You . Felt his bandage ? MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE I merely checked his bandage to make sure it was n't pressing the wound . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE You did this . How ? MORSE I can show you . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE ( To Darcy ) : How did you check his bandage ? ( Darcy does n't answer , just shakes her head . Snelgrave calls Bunce . ) Bunce . Bunce ! ( Bunce enters with the rag and pail . ) BUNCE I have n't finished the kitchen walls yet , sir . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE Put down the vinegar . I want you to stand there . Right here . Yes . Nothing else . Just stand . ( Bunce stands with his back to the audience . ) Now , Mrs. Snelgrave . As my wife . As a Christian woman , show me how you checked that his bandage was n't too tight . So that it would n't press the wound . ( Beat ) Do it , woman , or so help me what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do to you . ( Darcy slowly nears Bunce . ) Just a minute , my dear . Surely , in the dark , his belly full of my gin , it would be difficult to feel the tension of his . Bandage . With your glove on . You must have taken off one of your gloves , did n't you ? ( Whispers , with menace ) Did n't you ? p. 44 MORSE Yes , she did . Because her glove dropped on the floor as he was slurping the gin . Slurp , slu  --  MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE ( To Morse ) : You shut your mouth . ( To Darcy ) Take off your glove . Let our good servant Bunce see what 's touched him in the dark . MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE William . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE Darcy ? ( Darcy stands before Bunce and removes her glove . We can not see her bare hand because Bunce blocks our view . ) Have a look , Bunce . ( Bunce does not look down at Darcy 's hand , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep her hands private , sir , it 's  --  MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE ( To Darcy ) : Tell him you want him to look . Because you do , do n't you ? That 's the nature of secrets . They yearn to be exposed . MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE You may . Look . BUNCE If it pleases you , missus . MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE It does . ( Bunce looks down at her hand . He does not react . Then he looks at Snelgrave , who deflates . Morse slowly comes around Bunce to have a look . She 's amazed rather than disgusted . She backs away and turns to Snelgrave. ) p. 45 MORSE You did this to her ! MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE It was an accident . MORSE You did this . ( Darcy puts her glove back on . ) SNELGRAVE ( Calm now ) : No , child . It was the fire did it to her . When she was seventeen . Just two years after we married . We lived outside the city then . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saving her horse . It was a wedding gift . MORSE ( To Darcy ) : Did you save the horse ? MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE No . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE She burned . My beautiful wife , who only the night before I 'd held in my arms . Naked , she was  --  MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE Quiet , William . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE I used to kneel at your feet , by the bedside at night . ( Bunce steps back and stands beside Morse . They watch the Snelgraves . ) And you 'd let your robe fall open . Your skin was like . Like . There was n't a name for it on this earth . ( Darcy puts her gloved hand on his head , she comforts him almost automatically . He closes his eyes . ) For hours on end in the night . My God , how I loved you . p. 46 MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE ( Moves away from Snelgrave ; speaks with calm reserve ) : Some of the animals freed themselves . The dappled mare my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mane was on fire . She kept leaping and rearing to shake it off but she could n't shake it off . The mare ran in circles around the garden . Faster and faster she ran , the fire eating its way to her coat . Her coat was wet , running with sweat , but that did n't stop the fire from spreading out across her flanks . A horse on fire . In full gallop . It was almost . Beautiful . It would have been . Beautiful . But for the smell . I can still smell them . After thirty-six years . The horses . Burning . ( Morse puts her hand in Bunce 's hand , and the two of them stand watching the Snelgraves . This action should be a subtle , almost unconscious gesture , on both their parts. ) p. 47 Act 1 , Scene 9 SCENE NINE Kabe outside on the street below the Snelgraves ' window . He is half-naked and wears a pan of burning charcoal on his head . He is preaching . KABE A monster , last week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Earl . His name on fear of death I do withhold . One eye in its forehead , no nose , and its two ears in the nape of its neck . And outside in the garden of that very same house , a thorn which bore five different fruits . And , good people of this city , if we must read these phenomena as signs  --  MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE ( At the window ) : Kabe . KABE And we must . Listen not to the liars and hypocrites  --  MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE Did you get the quicksilver ? KABE  --  for they will tell you that it is the wrath of God against an entire people , corrupt in both spirit and in heart . ( Kabe stops preaching , steps back and speaks to Snelgrave . ) Got it . Babel , Babylon , Sodom and Gomorrah , cow shit I tell you . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE And the walnut shell ? KABE Had a little trouble with the walnut shell . Hazelnut is all I could come by . p. 48 MR . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Dr. Brooks 's pamphlet specifically states that the quicksilver must be hung about the neck in a walnut shell . KABE With the hazelnut , only five shillings . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE You said four yesterday . KABE That was before the Bills went up again . ( Turns back to preach ) And I say to you if it is God 's wrath , then why has He chosen Oxford for the birth of this monster ? MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE What about the oil and frankincense ? KABE Because Oxford is where the court has retired , the king and all his fancy , fawning courtiers . Because the plague  --  ( To Snelgrave ) Could n't get any  --  ( Preaching ) is a Royalist phenomenon . Who dies ? One simple question . ( To Snelgrave ) But I do have a toad . ( Preaching ) Who dies ? ( To Snelgrave ) Not dead two hours . ( Preaching ) Is this not a poor man 's plague ?

WILLIAM SNELGRAVE Two shillings . KABE Right . ( Preaching ) Go to the deepest pit near Three Nuns ' Inn , if you dare , and you will see who it is that dies , their mouths open in want , the maggots moving inside their tongues , making their tongues wag as though they were about to speak . But they will never speak again in this world . The hungry . The dirty . The abandoned . That 's who dies . Not the fancy and the wealthy , there 's hardly a one , for they have fled , turned their back on the city . Clergymen , physicians and surgeons , all fled . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE Have you thought again about my little offer ? KABE ( To Snelgrave ) : Sorry . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE I could make you rich . KABE As well as dead if I let you escape . ( Preaching ) And here we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from lack of bread and wages as from the plague  --  MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE Where are your clothes ? And what 's that you got on your head ? KABE Pan of charcoal . Keeps the bad air from my head when I unplug my finger from God 's arsehole . p. 50 MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE Blasphemer ! Put on your clothes . You 're a Snelgrave Guard . KABE Not on Tuesdays I 'm not . ( Nods to offstage ) On Tuesdays old Stewart fills in for me . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE Why , you 're behaving like one of those madmen . Those conjurers . Those dealers with the Devil . KABE Solomon Eagle , at your service . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE This is outrageous . I wo n't have a conjurer guarding our door ! It 's bad enough that I 'm kept captive by you , Kabe , but that you summon more scum from their hellholes to stand below my windows . My house . My street . My city ! KABE ( Preaches again ) :  --  Is on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money is on loan by the Lord Mayor to the king , and Parliament takes no action . They stir their soup with our bones . The grass grows up and down White Hall court and no boats move on the river but to war . Dead as dung upon the face of the earth we all shall be if we do not resist . I say to you : get off your knees . Rise up ! Rise up ! ( Beat ) But how do we begin ? With this . With this , my friends . ( Takes out a small vial of liquid ) The road to the poor man 's Heaven : only six shillings ! Solomon Eagle 's plague water . p. 51 MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE Six shillings ! That 's robbery . KABE ( Preaching still ) : Is your dignity not worth six shillings ? It 's your duty to keep your body strong for this long and bloody struggle ! Do not let the monsters of Oxford beat you down . Arise , arise into all your glory ! You , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Six shillings , and the world is yours ! MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE I 'll give you five . ( Snelgrave drops the coins to Kabe , who catches them in a small jar of vinegar . ) Do I drink it ? KABE One thimbleful each night before retiring . Also anoint the nostrils , ear holes and anus twice a day . ( Beat ) Sir Braithwaite 's girl . She died with her parents . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE How do you know ? KABE Spoke to one of the maids that used to work there . Her husband did their garden . He found the family dead . They say there was something stuffed in the dead child 's mouth . Some kind of animal . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE She ca n't be dead ! She 's alive and well and a pest in my house . KABE The maid used to bathe the Braithwaite girl . Maid said the girl had a scar the shape of a key ' cross her belly . Happened when she was a baby . Some kind of accident . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If one of you dies in there , can we pull the body out the window ? We doubled up the boards on your door and it will be a hell of a work to open it up again . p. 52 MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE The dying is done in this house , I thank the Lord . And when the dying is done in this city , Kabe , you better run , because I smell a Leveller 's blood in you , ringing loud and clear . I thought we buried the lot of you . KABE My father was a Leveller , sir . His son 's just a poor man with a pan of charcoal on his head . And now the old man 's dead . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE Plague ? KABE One of my toads , sir . Had a dozen of them in a bucket at the bedside . One of them got out and , well , my father , he snored and down one went and got stuck and the old man choked to death . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Levellers . Diggers . I say cut them to pieces or they will cut us to pieces . KABE Do you want the toad as it is , or do you want me to bore the hole ? MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE You do it . And get me a piece of string to hang it on as well . KABE Wife 's piss also works wonders . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE ( Realizing he 's being taken in ) : Vermin . KABE Use your wife 's urine to purify , before that sailor does . p. 53 MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE You 'll be dead soon KABE But will she let you have it ? MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE And I 'll find you in your lime pit and piss in your mouth . p. 54 Act 1 , Scene 10 SCENE TEN Snelgrave , Darcy , Morse and Bunce in the room . Boredom . Morse sits and ties figures out of cloth and sticks . Then she glances about the room . Her eyes rest on Darcy . She stands and goes to her . MORSE I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? MORSE It 's sweet . It 's rotting in your chest . ( Snelgrave snorts . ) My mother did n't smell like you . She smelled like lemons . MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE That 's lovely . MORSE Because she was always afraid . ( Snelgrave snorts again . ) Last night I dreamed that an angel tried to land on our roof . But he had no feet so he could n't stand . He crawled in through the window , to touch our faces , but he had no hands . He said to me , " Come to my arms . " But he had none . This morning I woke up and there was a feather in my mouth . Look . ( Morse shows Darcy a small , white feather . She runs the feather gently over Darcy 's face . ) MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE Must we listen to this senseless babble day in and day out . I 'm sick of it . Bloody sick of it . p. 55 MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE Then pass your time in the kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter died in her own house . Says they found her naked . Naked and dead .

WILLIAM SNELGRAVE On her stomach . MORSE ( To Darcy ) : Is the rest of your body burned ? MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE Yes MORSE What does it feel like ? MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE I think we should have a look . MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE Feel like ? Most of the places on my skin I ca n't feel . ( Morse runs her hand lightly down Darcy 's arm , slowly . ) MORSE Can you feel that ? MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE No . Yes . There . At the elbow .

WILLIAM SNELGRAVE Bunce could do it . ( Morse runs her hands slowly over Darcy 's breasts . Darcy does not stop her . This action is no different from how Morse touched Darcy 's arms . Snelgrave stands over them . ) MORSE Can you feel this ? MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE A scar the shape of a key . MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE ( Sincerely trying to answer Morse 's questions ) : Not yet . Yes . There . Under your left hand . I can feel something there . MORSE What do you feel ? MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE We could all be in danger . MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE I feel I do n't know . No one has touched me there . In years . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE ( Grabbing Morse 's arm ) : It 's about time we found out just who you are , young lady . Bunce ! MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE Let go of her . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE ( Shoving Morse into Bunce 's arms ) : You 're the strongest , Bunce . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should be the one , sir . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE You do as I tell you .

( Bunce begins to unbutton Morse 's shirt buttons . ) MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE Bunce . Do n't you dare . ( Bunce looks from Snelgrave to Darcy . ) MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE You cross me ? MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE I sponged the child . Twice . She has the scar . But your idiot Kabe is mistaken . It 's not a key . The scar is like a spoon . ( To Snelgrave ) After the fire . Not once . Not even to embrace me . I was . Even changed . I was still  --  MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE ( Interrupts ) : How could I have loved you ? It was never about who you were but about what was left of you . ( Morse raises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scar . ) MORSE The angel took my scar . ( Snelgrave glares at his wife . ) In exchange for the feather . p. 58 BUNCE I think I 'll vinegar the kitchen walls again , sir . ( Snelgrave puts out his cane to stop Bunce . ) MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE Tell me something , Bunce . If you had a wife and she lied to you . Lied to you , in front of company . What would you do ? ( Bunce is silent . ) You 'll learn , Bunce . ( Snelgrave shoves Bunce toward Darcy , and accidentally touches Bunce 's wound . Bunce winces . Snelgrave looks at his hand in disgust and then wipes it off . ) Get that thing to stop oozing ! There she is . The liar . And perhaps a whore . Though she 'd have to do all her whoring in the dark because . Well . As a young woman she was rather large up top . How would you sailors say it ? BUNCE Well-rigged , sir . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's just say that half her sails have been burned away and leave it at that . ( Beat ) As you stand there , Bunce , looking at your wife , you realize that she 's not only a liar but unsound under all that linen . ( Beat ) Strike her . ( Beat ) I said strike her . BUNCE ( To Darcy , as he prepares to hit her ) : I 'm sorry , missus . ( He raises his arm to strike her ) p. 59 MORSE ( Sinking to her knees , quietly ) : Mother ? ( Beat ) Hush , hush . Do not cry . ( The others look at her . Morse has wet herself . She is ill . The piss slowly makes a line across the floor between them . ) I am filled . With angels . p. 60 Act 1 , Scene 11 SCENE ELEVEN Morse still sitting on the floor , alone , in dim light . In the cell or place of confinement , as in Scene One . MORSE ( Whispers ) : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sound of a slap . This time Morse flinches at the slaps . ) She smelled . Of lemons . ( Another slap , harder . ) Maybe she was my age . No . She was . Lissa was . A year younger . She had brown hair as long as a horse 's tail and like cakes her dresses were . Rimmed with yellows and blues . Lissa had a fat stick that she kept in her trunk of toys and she would sneak up behind me as I swept the floors and hit me across the back . When I cried , she 'd let me hold the bird that her grandfather brought home with him from India . It was a green and black bird and it could sing a melody . When I held it I could feel its tiny heart beating inside its chest . ( Darcy enters and stands in the shadows of the cell . ) Sometimes when Lissa 's father scolded her she would come running to me and fling herself into my arms and weep . Her tears soaked my dirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet and feels her dress . It is wet . ) Ugh . I 've wet myself . ( She takes the dress off and casts it in the corner . She is wearing long underwear , perhaps a boy 's , underneath ) And then I got sick and Mr. Snelgrave shouted , " Plague ! Plague ! " but I had no tokens . ( Darcy takes up the dress and holds it , then exits with it . ) My teeth swelled . I vomited . I had the spotted fever . For three days , Mrs. Snelgrave held me in her arms . ( Beat ) That week Kabe said the pits were near over-flowing . But Kabe said it was n't only the dead that went to the pits . Some of the living went to the pits to die of grief . More than once , he said , when he tried to pull the grievers out of the pits he heard a sound like a stick snapping in their chests.Lissa 's father , Mr. Braithwaite , died first . Then the mother . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside out they rotted . Lissa died more slowly . We were alone in the house . She said , " Hold me . " Her body was covered in tokens . ( Beat ) But it was n't Lissa 's blood that was on my sleeve . ( Beat ) Who was alive and who was dead ? In the pits their faces looked the same . Dried out by grief . And their hearts snapping in two inside their chests . Such a sound , Kabe said . Such a small , small sound , like this : ( She makes a small sound ) ( Blackout. ) @x Snelgrave and Bunce in the room . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE And what was the longest period you sailed without port ? BUNCE Two years . Though we docked , we could n't leave the ship , so afraid was our captain that we 'd not come back . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE You 're still a young man . BUNCE I was never a young man , sir . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE Well , in the name of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while so long at sea ? BUNCE Stayed alive . As best we could . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE I mean with your baser instincts . Those instincts against God . BUNCE Aboard the vessels I sailed , we never murdered our captain . Though once we threw one overboard after he beat the cook with a pitch mop . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE Bunce . You are in my house . I come in contact with the court and Parliament . I attend Cabinet meetings . At this very moment the Dutch are nuzzling at our shores . ( Snelgrave gives Bunce an orange . Bunce takes it but does not eat . He lets out a whistle  --  oranges are a delicacy even in good times . ) On these long voyages , without the comforts of a wife , what did you do to satisfy your unseemly satisfactions ? p. 63 BUNCE Between the Devil and the deep blue sea , there 's little satisfaction , sir . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE ( Whacks his cane ) : At night , Bunce . Packed in there man to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ halfway to Madras and it 's sweltering hot and you wake with the hunger of a shark . But not for food . The Devil is foaming at your lips . What do you do , man ? You 're frothing with desire . What do you do ? BUNCE I do n't know as I ever frothed with desire , sir . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE The Lord , may He be forgiven , Bunce , gave you a foul and fleshful instrument that resides in your loins . And though you may attempt to ignore this instrument of debasement , in the darkness of a ship , among the sweat of rats and tired men , this instrument certainly led you  --  BUNCE ( Interrupts ) : You mean my prick , sir ? MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE Not in this house . BUNCE It goes where I go , sir . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE Exactly . And where does it go when your body is snarling and gnashing and snapping like a wild dog and it must be satisfied or you 'll die ! ? ( Bunce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Bunce nears Snelgrave , close , too close . He takes Snelgrave 's finger , examines it a moment , then forces it through the rind of the orange . Bunce turns the orange on Snelgrave 's finger , slowly , sensually . Then he pulls the orange off of Snelgrave 's finger . Involuntarily , Snelgrave looks at his wet finger . Bunce raises the orange over his head , squeezes it and drinks from the hole in the rind . ) I issue commissions to the Navy Board . ( Beat ) I draft resolutions to send to the king . ( They look at each other. ) p. 64 p. 65 Act 2 , Scene 2 SCENE TWO Snelgrave , Darcy , Morse and Bunce in the room . Morse now sits on the mat in the corner with Bunce . She wears long johns . Darcy coughs once , twice . BUNCE Can I get you some water ? MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE No , thank you , Bunce . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE ( Mocking ) : " Can I get you some water ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened to your manners ? It 's Mrs. Snelgrave . Mrs. Snelgrave . " Can I get you some water , Mrs. Snelgrave . " ( Beat ) Bunce . BUNCE Mrs. Snelgrave . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE That 's right . That 's right . MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE William . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE I 'm an old man , Bunce . I sleep sound . Do you sleep sound ? BUNCE Usually , sir . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE They say a man who 'd put to sea for pleasure would go to hell for pastime . ( Beat ) What 's your pastime , Bunce ? Heh ? ( Snelgrave pokes at Bunce with his stick . Morse runs to Darcy . ) We 'll be out of here one day . Never see each other 's rotten faces again . But where will you go ? What will you do ? I have work . I have friends . Do you have work , Bunce ? Do you have friends ? p. 66 MORSE I 'm his friend . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE ( To Morse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Beat ) Tell us another story , Bunce . A real brute of a sea story . We 've got some time left . To kill . I 'll give you two shillings if it 's good BUNCE No , sir . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE No ? MORSE He said no . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE What 's the matter , Bunce ? What 's got under your skin ? ( Poking him again with his stick , harder ) What 's on your mind ? BUNCE I got four things on my mind , sir . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE ( Still poking him ) : Go on . I 'm intrigued . Four things . BUNCE First is that stick you keep poking me with . Second is when I get out of here , I wo n't sail for the Navy again . Ever . I 'll kill somebody first , even if it 's me . Third is your wife , Darcy Snelgrave . And fourth is your wife as well . I count her twice ' cause she 's much on my mind  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of my wife ! BUNCE You do n't , sir , so I thought I might . p. 67 MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE What ? What ? What do you think of my wife ? MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE Stop this , William . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE What do you think of my wife ? BUNCE The way a tar thinks , sir , you do n't want to know . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE ( Still poking him ) : No . I do n't . You swine . Eat your words . Eat them . ( He forces the stick in Bunce 's mouth ) Eat them . ( Bunce firmly but calmly grabs the stick and walks Snelgrave backward until Snelgrave sits in his chair . ) BUNCE Move , sir , from this chair and I 'll push this stick through your heart . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE Darcy ? MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE ( Calmly ) : Morse , bring me the rope . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE Darcy ! ( Morse gets rope and she and Darcy tie Snelgrave in the chair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warns Snelgrave . Kabe pops his head in . ) KABE A morning to all , good neighbors . Mr. Snelgrave , Mrs. Snelgrave . Rabble . Want the Bills this week ? Not leveling out . God save the king I say . The Devil wo n't have him . p. 68 MORSE We 're playing : we 're going to cook Mr. Snelgrave . KABE No harm done , heh ? And here 's something for your game , Morse . ( Kabe throws Morse an orange . ) Mrs. Snelgrave ? Need anything ? ( There is no reply . An awkward silence . ) Well . I 'm off , as the scab said . Working the pits . Deaf Stewart 'll take over for me tonight . Throw something at him when you want his attention . MORSE Can you get me some good linen from the pits ? I want a new dress . KABE There 's a king 's ransom in them pits . And along the roads . Bodies just asking you to strip ' em . If the family ai n't robbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SNELGRAVE Morse ! Kabe ! Have you no sympathy KABE They do n't need it anymore , do they , Mrs. Snelgrave . Mr. Snelgrave . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE Kabe KABE ( Ignoring Snelgrave 's plea ) : What 's terrible at the pits is n't the dead . What 's terrible is that there are persons who are n't dead but are infected with the plague and they come freely to the pit , shouting , delirious with fever , half-naked , wrapped in blankets , and they throw themselves into the pits , on top of the dead , and expire there . p. 69 MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE Kabe ! KABE Others are still dying . They leap about the pit , roaring , tearing the clothes from their bodies , taking up sticks and sharp stones and cutting open their sores to relieve the pain , some hacking away at their flesh until they fall down dead in their own blood . Ay , that 's what 's terrible . Not death , but life that has nothing left but still wo n't give itself up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE Let me go .

Darcy enters . They watch each other silently in the dark . MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE He sleeps . BUNCE Yes . ( Some moments . ) What do you want , missus ? MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE I want . To see it . BUNCE Why ? MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE I think about it . All the time . What it must . Look like . BUNCE That 's what you think about ? MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE Please . Lift your shirt . BUNCE You know what I think about , Mrs. Snelgrave ? MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE Maybe it 's a joke . A lie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the streets and pretend you 're Christ , with a wound that does n't heal , and they 'll give you alms . BUNCE Excuse me , but it 's none of your damn business . ( Darcy turns to leave . ) Darcy . MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE You 're not to call me that . Ever . p. 71 BUNCE I do n't want you to see it . ( Beat ) But you can touch it . If you must . MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE Yes . BUNCE Give me your hand . ( She does so . ) Close your eyes , missus . ( Darcy closes her eyes . ) Keep them closed . ( She nods . He guides her hands under his shirt . ) Feel it ? ( Some moments . ) MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE There . BUNCE Yeah . MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE It 's a small . Hole . Does it hurt ? BUNCE I do n't know . Some of the skin , it has feeling left . Go on . Some of it does n't . MRS . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : ) BUNCE What ? MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE My finger . I 've put my finger . Inside . It 's warm . ( Beat ) It feels like I 'm inside you . BUNCE You are . ( After some moments , Darcy takes her hand out from under his bandage . There is blood on her fingers . She looks at her hand as though it might have changed. ) p. 72 MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE You should have died from a wound like that . BUNCE It was an accident . MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE An accident ? BUNCE That I lived . MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE Do you know I 've hardly given you a thought in these weeks , but every night I ravish you in my sleep . Why is that , Bunce ? Can you tell me why that is ? BUNCE It 's nothing to worry over , Mrs. Snelgrave . You people always want to fuck your servants . ( Darcy raises her arm to hit him . Bunce stops her . ) You have n't an idea in hell who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sailor . You steal . You kill . ( Bunce begins to run his hands along her arms , much as Morse did earlier , slowly , watching her face to see what she can feel . ) BUNCE I worked the Royal Navy off and on for eleven years . Here ? MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE No . BUNCE Deserted when I could . In between I skulked the city . There ? ( Darcy shakes her head no . Bunce moves on slowly to touch her shoulders and neck . ) I got picked up on the waters  --  here ? p. 73 MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE Yes . BUNCE By the Spaniards and served them against the French . There ? ( Darcy shakes her head no . ) Then the Hollanders against the English . ( Bunce goes down on his knees . He puts his hands under her dress to touch her ankles . We can not see his hands or her legs as her dress is long . She does n't stop him , though she looks to see if Snelgrave is still sleeping . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Darcy does her best to hide both her fear and pleasure and she hides them very well . ) Then I was taken up again by the English out of Dunkirker and served against the Hollanders . ( Beat ) There ? ( Moving his hands higher up her legs ) There ? MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE I do n't know . Yes . I think so . BUNCE Last I was taken by the Turks  --  MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE The Turks . BUNCE Where I was forced to serve them against the English , French , Dutch and Spaniards and all Christendom . The last time I got picked up , I was in church . MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE Church . BUNCE In Bristol . The press gangs had orders to pick up all men without property , above fifteen . They must have raided half a dozen churches to get the men they needed .

In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the mizzen shrouds and swept overboard . Another fell from the jib boom . p. 74 MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE Jib boom ? BUNCE There was one boy who took sick with the motion . His neck and face swelled with the retching . Then his tongue went black . He held out his arms to us . For mercy . Then he vomited his stomach up into his hands and died . ( Touching her ) This ? Yeah . Here . ( Beat ) We sailed to battle the Dutch at Tescell . MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE Tescell . BUNCE Over twenty ships went down on fire . And the gulls . Screaming above the cannons . They would n't fly from the ships . Here ? ( Beat ) Some of them . Their wings caught fire , so close did they circle the sinking masts . When the battle was over , half of the men . Dead in the water . Floating face down in the waves , still in the Sunday suits they 'd been picked up in . ( Beat ) I sailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her intimately ) And here ? Yeah . Right here . ( Beat ) In all that time I did n't kill . ( Beat ) Mrs. Snelgrave ? MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE ( Whispers ) : Yes . BUNCE I never killed . It was in me though . Do you want me to stop ? ( Darcy does not answer him. ) p. 75 Act 2 , Scene 4 SCENE FOUR Snelgrave still tied in his chair . Bunce curled up and asleep on his mat . He does n't stir through the entire scene . Morse sits and plays with two small cloth-and-stick dolls . She is wearing one of Darcy 's dresses , which does n't fit her at all , but she is happy to be dressed in it . MORSE And the two lovers were happy and the sky a blue grape and the birds sang . ( To Snelgrave ) Can you make the tweet of the birds ? MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE If you untie me . MORSE ( Uses a doll to speak ) : I ca n't , Mr. Snelgrave . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in half with your cane . ( To Snelgrave ) If you do n't want to play , then shut up . ( Back to her game ) And the two lovers were happy and the sky a fat apple and the birds sang . And the world  --  ( Snelgrave begins to make bird sounds . Morse listens a moment . She approves . ) And the birds sang sweetly and the world was good and  --  ( She looks at Snelgrave 's bare feet )  --  even the rich had shoes . But one day the world changed . ( She strikes a tinderbox ) And it never changed back . ( She holds one of the dolls near the flame ) p. 76 MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE Do n't do that . ( Beat ) Please . MORSE The young man said . But the fire angel would have her heart . ( She lights the stick doll on fire and sets it on the floor to burn . They watch it burn out . ) Even her voice was burned , but still he heard her say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to her and  --  MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE No . He did n't come to her . He was a coward , your man . ( Darcy almost enters the room but then stops and watches them . They are intent on the story and do not see her . ) MORSE He knelt down beside her  --  MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE He walked away . MORSE  --  and put his hand into the ashes that were her body . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE He turned his back . MORSE The young man sifted the ashes until he found what was left of her heart . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE Small and black and empty it was  --  MORSE But it was her heart . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE And the young man put the burnt organ  --  p. 77 MORSE No bigger than a walnut shell  --  MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE  --  into a glass of his own blood . ( While Morse speaks the following , Snelgrave softly makes bird sounds as before . ) MORSE And there the heart drank and drank until it was plump once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his arms again , she being now only the size of his palm , he could caress her with his fingers , and when it was winter the heart lay against his cold breast and kept him warm . ( Darcy leaves . They do not notice . ) MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE I 'm an ordinary man . I never meant to be cruel . MORSE Neither did Sir Braithwaite . And yet when my mother , a maid in his house for fourteen years , came to him one morning with the black tokens on her neck , he locked her in the root cellar . He was afraid they 'd close up his house if they found out someone had taken sick . Neither food nor water he gave her . I lay outside the cellar door . With the door between us , we slept with our mouths to the crack so that we could feel each other 's breath . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE We did n't lock up our maids . We called for a surgeon . MORSE She said , " Hold me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was between us and I could not hold her . p. 78 MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE Enough of this . Get me some water , child . MORSE Did you bring them water when they were dying ? MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE Yes . MORSE You lie . You sent your boy to do it . You never looked on them once they were sick . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE I could n't help them . It was God 's wish . MORSE You locked them in the cellar . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE That 's not true . MORSE And they died in the dirt and blood of their own bodies . And their last breath blew under the door and found your fat mouth and hid inside it and waited for the proper moment to fill your throat . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE You are an evil , evil girl . If your mother were alive  --  MORSE My mother lives in your mouth , and one day she will choke you . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE Who 's your father , girl ? MORSE I was born from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE More likely Sir Braithwaite . Masters make free with their maids . I 'll be honest . I 've done so myself . Perhaps this gentleman you despise and ridicule was your own father . Heh ? How about that , little girl ? Ever thought of that ? ( Morse stands staring at him some moments . Then she quickly lifts the long dress and flashes him . This action is not seductive . For Morse it is as though she were pissing on him . After a moment , he turns his head away . She picks up the doll that played the prince . With a kick she scatters the remains of the burnt doll on the floor . She exits. ) p. 79 p. 80 Act 2 , Scene 5 SCENE FIVE Darcy , Bunce , Morse and Snelgrave , still tied to his chair . Morse has taken off Darcy 's dress and goes about in her long johns again . Snelgrave is dressed in Bunce 's clothes , which fit poorly . Bunce is putting on Snelgrave 's pants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throws it aside . There is laughter and an initial sense of merriment from all four of them . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE Ha ! They 're a poor fit . You see ! Untie me , Darcy . MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE Please stop asking me that . Tomorrow perhaps . Not today . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE Bunce . I 'll pay you in gold if you let me go . BUNCE The child has already given me half your gold , sir . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE But I have more at the Navy Board . Much more . MORSE ( Brings the vinegar bucket and begins to wash Snelgrave . He pays no attention ) : First we clean the meat . Then we cook it . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE ( To Darcy ) : You do realize we ca n't go on after this as man and wife . MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE We have n't gone on as man and wife  --  p. 81 MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE I 'll put you out in the streets . MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE  --  since I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shame of the city . Less than a whore . You 'll live in the kennel , stink  --  MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE La , la . And I will strip and walk naked to your Navy Board , and in the courtyard I will dance . MORSE Like a pinecone on fire she 'll dance . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE There 's no life for you outside of this marriage , outside of this house . Bunce ca n't take care of you . MORSE But Bunce can tie knots . I can tie a cat's-paw best . Mrs. Snelgrave can do a Flemish-eye faster than he can . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE Tying knots with Bunce now , are we ? How sweet . How delicious . Tell me , Bunce , what 's her cunny like ? ( Bunce does n't answer . ) Bread that 's left too long in the oven ? MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE ( To Bunce ) : Why do n't you answer him ? ( Silence some moments . Bunce shrugs , then takes a drink of water . He leans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kisses him , but instead he lets the water trickle slowly out of his mouth across Snelgrave 's mouth and face . Snelgrave is so shocked by the audacity and sensuality of this act that by the time he resists , Bunce is through. ) p. 82 BUNCE That 's your wife , sir . Though I have n't yet had the pleasures you assume . Only with my left hand . My right hand aches with jealousy . ( Snelgrave closes his eyes and appears to be praying . Bunce looks at Darcy for approval . She blushes . Snelgrave opens one eye and sees her blush . He spits at her but misses . ) MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE If all you needed was a man as low as this to bring you ' round , I could have paid Kabe to do it . MORSE I saw Kabe 's mousie once . Its tail was long and skinny . MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE No one brought me ' round , William . I 've lain beside you like a piece of old charcoal most of my life and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE ( Interrupts ) : I would n't expect much pleasure in return , Bunce . She 's an old woman . Her mouth stinks . Her  --  MORSE ( Sticking her bare toe in his face ) : What will you pay me if I let you suck my toe ? MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE You foul child ! MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE It seems centuries ago , but you used to weep at the pleasure I gave you . MORSE Kabe paid me a sugar-knot for a kiss . p. 83 MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE ( To Darcy ) : You lie . ( To Bunce ) I bet she has n't pleased you , has she ? MORSE Small fruits and berries for a suck on the little toes . MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE Answer him , Bunce . MORSE Larger fruits for a suck on the big one . BUNCE No . She has n't . MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE ( To Snelgrave ) : He 's never asked me to . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE You think a man needs to ask ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says you 've never asked her ! BUNCE Well , sir . I just sort of expected she 'd take what she wanted . It 's always been that way between us kind , has n't it ? MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE Ha ! MORSE Ha ! BUNCE What 's changed ? MORSE You 're wearing new shoes . BUNCE That I am . And a man in these shoes should be able to ask MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE Go on . MORSE Yes ? p. 84 BUNCE Will you , Mrs. Snelgrave MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE Yes ? MORSE Go on . BUNCE Bring . A poor sailor . And part-time servant . To his crisis ? ( Snelgrave bursts out laughing , and Morse , copying Snelgrave , laughs too . Bunce blushes . ) MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE I do n't think I could  --  MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE See ? It was n't only me . She did n't like it after the fire either . MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE I do n't know a great deal about  --  MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE It was a horror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Other people . Their bodies . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE For years , the smoke rose out of her mouth as she slept . MORSE But she could learn . Could n't she , Mr. Snelgrave ? MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE Learn ? Her ? Never , child . MORSE Of course she could . If Bunce stands here . And Mrs. Snelgrave right there . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE What ? p. 85 MORSE Come on . Do n't be stupid . ( They follow her orders . ) Mrs. Snelgrave puts her hands on his chest . Go on . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE His chest ? BUNCE Is n't that my bit ? MORSE Not this time , it is n't . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE You 're all mad . MORSE Then she gives him a little kiss on the cheek . ( Darcy does so . ) MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE Mad ! MORSE Then she takes off her glove . Mrs. Snelgrave ? ( Darcy takes off her glove . ) And she lets it drop to the floor . Like a leaf . Ha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Snelgrave , she lets her hand slowly move down his chest , slowly , down . Yes . To there . ( Darcy 's hand rests on Bunce 's belt . ) MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE ( To Morse ) : Where were you schooled , slut ? MORSE Keyholes . ( Beat ) And now it 's only polite to make sure Bunce is still with her , so she says , " May I ? " ( Darcy does n't speak. ) p. 86 MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE She ca n't say it ! Ha . MORSE " Do you want me to touch you ? " she says . ( Bunce does n't answer . ) MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE " Yes , I do , " he says . MORSE And then we do this . ( Morse blindfolds Snelgrave . ) MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE Hey ! Devil 's spawn . Take that off . MORSE And I go to the kitchen . MR . WILLIAM SNELGRAVE Take it off ! ( Morse sighs , takes the rag from the bucket , and puts it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DARCY SNELGRAVE ( Wanting Snelgrave to hear them ) : Shhh . I do n't want my husband to hear us . BUNCE We 'll be as quiet as the dead . ( Snelgrave screams through his stuffed rag. ) p. 87 Act 2 , Scene 6 SCENE SIX Early morning light . Snelgrave slumped in his chair . Morse enters in a nightdress  --  Snelgrave 's shirt discarded by Bunce in the previous scene . Morse approaches him , closer , closer until their faces are almost touching . MORSE That was n't a poor bird you did yesterday . It was quite good , really . ( She touches him , then shakes him . He is dead . ) Where did you go , Mr. Snelgrave ? ( She unbuttons his shirt and checks his chest and neck . ) You have n't even got the tokens . ( She slowly begins to untie Snelgrave as she speaks the following . ) Sir Braithwaite 's daughter had a bird . A green and black bird . Whack , whack went her stick on my back when I swept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd stop my crying . The bird had a song like a long , long spoon , and we could sip at it like jam . And the song put a butterfly inside our mouths , and it opened its wings in there and made us laugh . ( She sits with the rope in her lap ) But everyone died in that house . And then Lissa was dying , too , and we were alone , and she lay on the floor with the tokens shining black on her neck . The tokens would not break and run , and Lissa wept from the pain .

They do n't notice her. ) p. 93 BUNCE I 'll show you a last one , then I 'm off . Thumb knot you use to tie the mouse and collar on the mast . You always go in here , not around . A good knot is like a dead man 's heart ; you ca n't break it . ( Bunce notices Darcy standing there . She is quietly watching them .

Bunce drops to his knees and raises her skirts . ) ( To Morse ) It 's her thighs . Get some coals from the kitchen . And some wet cloth . ( Morse exits . Bunce puts his arms under Darcy 's dress and begins to massage her thighs vigorously . ) We 've got to soften the botches . With heat . Then we can lance them . ( Darcy sits in a daze .

( He puts the coal under Darcy 's dress , against her skin . Darcy flinches . ) MORSE ( Attempting to distract her ) : Did you care for him ? MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE Who ? MORSE Mr. Snelgrave . MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE I knew him only as a boy . After the fire , he bore the same name , but that was the only resemblance . Yes . As a boy . Perhaps I loved him . Look at him there .

DARCY SNELGRAVE Many , many times . And his tongue so cold . It covered my skin with frost . ( Darcy screams . Bunce takes the knife from her hand and begins to bring it under her skirt to lance the tokens . Suddenly Darcy is completely lucid . She stops Bunce 's hand . ) No . BUNCE If I can make them run there 's a chance . MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE Goddamn you , Bunce . The life is pouring out of me . ( Shouts ) Help me ! ( Quietly ) Help me .

DARCY SNELGRAVE If you stop me , you 'll regret it . And I 'll curse you the moment I die . ( Beat ) You can leave the room , sailor . I 'm not asking you to stay . ( Bunce stares at her for what seems a long time . Then he kisses her , gently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away , she pulls him back and forces him to kiss her , hard , on the mouth . Then Bunce goes to his mat and kneels there , his face to the wall . Darcy speaks to Morse . ) So you will help me . MORSE What will you give me ? MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE Well , I do n't think I have anything left . MORSE Your gloves . MRS . DARCY SNELGRAVE All right , my gloves . ( Darcy removes her gloves . She puts Morse 's hands on the knife and her own hands over Morse 's . ) You must not waver , Morse . Not for one moment . Do you understand ? ( Morse nods . Darcy places the blade point against her chest , over her heart . Darcy closes her eyes. ) p. 98 MORSE Do n't close your eyes , Mrs. Snelgrave . All you 'll see is blackness . ( Morse puts her face close to Darcy 's face . ) Look at me . At my face . ( Darcy opens her eyes . ) MRS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child has passed through the lungs of an angel . You said that . ( Darcy nods . ) So the breath of an angel now covers your face . Can you feel it ? ( She blows on Darcy 's face . ) And I will hold you , hush , hush . The angel 's tongue is plump with blood and my mouth so cold it covers your skin with snow as the flames , like scissors , open your dress . And my kiss is a leaf . It falls from the sky and comes to rest on your breast . And my kiss is strong and pierces your heart  --  ( Morse helps Darcy drive the knife into her heart . ) Like a secret from God . ( Darcy is dead . Morse pulls out the knife . She holds it out to Bunce . Morse is completely still , perhaps in shock . Finally Bunce turns around . ) It is done . We are dead . p. 99 Act 2 , Scene 9 SCENE NINE Semi-darkness . In the cell or place of confinement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dead Snelgraves , still in their chairs . Nothing of Bunce or of Bunce 's presence remains . Morse stands center stage , again in her dirty dress . MORSE Can I go now ? ( Beat ) There 's nothing more to tell of them.Years it was . Or weeks and days , by the time the doors were opened . The city was empty . The air was sweet with sugar and piss . And it was quiet . So quiet . And I walked down to the quay side . The boats were still . There was no wind . The river was not moving . Everyone had gone . One way or another . ( Kabe enters in the shadows . He covers Snelgrave with a cloth . ) I stood by the banks and looked in the water . There were no fish . There was nothing but water . Water that did n't move . But then , I saw a child floating there . On her back . She rose so close to the surface I could have touched her . A girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And naked . She had no marks . In each hand she clutched a fist of black hair . Her mouth was open and filled with the river . As I reached in the water to touch her , a ship hoisted its sail . A door slammed in the street . One , two , three voices called out to one other . A bell rang . And the city came alive once more . ( Sings ) Oranges and lemons Sing the bells of St Clements . ( Kabe covers Darcy with a cloth . ) When I looked down in the water again for the body of the child , it was gone . And I was glad . I was glad it had gone . ( Kabe exits . ) Kabe once said to me , " Our lives are just a splash of water on a stone . Nothing more . " ( She kneels , as though in prayer ) Then I am the stone on which they fell . And they have marked me.So beware.Because I loved them , and they have marked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her pocket . She holds it in her lap , looking at it , her head bowed .
