Captiain 's Log . Stardate 3198.4 . The crew seems nervous as the U.S.S. Enterprise approaches planet Organia . The Federation has ordered us to protect the citizens , who have been under military rule by our most bitter enemies - the Klingons. mies  --  the Klingons . Klingons ? Enemies ? It 's true  --  friendly Klingons of the 1980 's and 90 's were actually feared foes during the original " Star Trek " series in the 1960 's No villain could convince Captain James T Kirk to put the Enterprise into warp speed faster than a Klingon Today after seven movies , four television show and a cartoon serious , " Star Trek " fans know the Klingons are good guys . It ' one of the victories of the United Federation of Planets , whose ships  --  like the Enterprise  --  explore the galaxy to keep the peace during the 23d and 24th centuries . But the Klingon 's attitued is n't all that has changed they look a lot different too . And Klingons are n't the only ones who seem a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the body-painted bad guys of the pasy . As " Star Trek " celebrates 30 years of television and movies this month , we take a look at how better materials , higher budgets and a makeup artist named Michael Westmore have changed the looks of many Star Trek Villains . KLINGONS The mysterious transformation of the Klingons , " Star Trek 's " original bad guys , started in 1979 's " Star Trek : The Motion Picture . " Suddenly , instead of looking like humans with funny eyebrows , they had strange foreheads . No explanation was given . If you think Klingon foreheads look like dinosaur bones , you 're right . That 's because Michael Westmore , makeup supervisor for television 's " Star Trek : Deep Space Nine " and " Star Trek ; Voyager , " bases his designs on the extinct reptiles . But the method he uses to create the foreheads is n't extinct . It 's the same process ST artists have used for years to create add-ons like Spock 's pointy ears . " What 's changed is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a former Life Scout with Troop 18 , North Hollywood , Calif . First , a clay mold is made of the design . Foam rubber is then poured into the mold . When it hardens , it 's applied to the actor 's forehead using a glue called spirit gum . ROMULANS Romulans might look like the peaceful Vulcans , but they sure do n't act like them . Once , Romulans massacred 4,000 Klingons . The Vulcans and Romulans used to be one race , which was obvious on the original television series . In fact , Romulan makeup was a lot like the makeup of the most famous Vulcan , Spock . Foam rubber ear tips were glued to the actor 's real ears using spirit gum . Then the outside halves of the actor 's eyebrows were shaved , and new , angled eyebrows made from yak belly hair were added . But since television 's " Star Trek : The Next Generation , " Romulans have looked a little different . " We wanted to distinguish them more from Vulcans , " Westmore said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression . " Romulans were going to be the main villains in the original series . But all those pointy ears were too expensive , so the less-costly Klingons turned into the leading bad guys . " Fred Phillips the makeup designer for the original ST had a budget of about zero , " Westmore said . " I generally spend about $3,000 to $5,000 an episode . " KHAN Khan Noonien Singh , one of the most notorious characters in ST history , was n't an alien . He was an ordinary human with extraordinary powers-which he used for evil . Khan 's makeup was simple : He was human , so he wore regular stage makeup . The trick came when Khan reappeared for the movie , about 15 years after he had last been seen on television . Makeup artists turned his dark hair from the series into a flowing white mane . Actor Ricardo Montalban himself did a lot of work , doing hundreds of push-ups and sit-ups to regain Khan 's sinister , powerful look . Q Of all the ST villains , there 's one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to " Voyager " on their toes : Q. He 's anything from an annoying pest to a dangerous menace . Q is an alien , but you would n't know it from looking at him . Actor John DeLancie , who has played Q since 1987 , gets regular stage makeup like any human character . " Q takes on whatever form he wants , " Westmore said . " When he 's with humans , he takes on human form . " CARDASSIANS The Cardassians were ruthless dictators of planet Bajor , until the Bajorans fought back . But the seething Cardassians stuck around to be the villains of television 's " Deep Space Nine . " Cardassians are **25;35;TOOLONG mean , that is . No wonder they look like lizards . And it probably was n't an accident . " When I design a new villain , I 'll try to put some of his traits into how the guy looks , " Westmore says . Of course , it does n't always work that way . About a year before he was asked to design the Cardassians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a spoon on her nose . Notice anything familiar about the Cardassians ' foreheads ? THE BORG Even the Federation did n't realize how nasty the Borg collective could be until they kidnapped the Enterprise 's Captain Picard . His capture led to the death of the wife of " Deep Space Nine " Commander Ben Sisko . A Borg 's ghoulish makeup is simply a latex bald wig and some pale skin-tone makeup . Then the actors step into their metal suits to transform into sinister cyborgs . The look for the Borg in the upcoming movie , " Star Trek : First Contact , " scheduled to be released this November , is even simpler . " We 're making them more streamlined by eliminating a lot of their tubes , " Westmore said . KASON-NISTRIM It 's bad enough that " Voyager 's " Captain Kathryn Janeway is lost in the Delta Quadrant years from home . She and her crew also have to watch out for the violent , aggressive Kason-Nistrim . Kason are humanoids . They basically look like people with weird foreheads . Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ST creator Gene Roddenberry in the original series . Westmore has no problem continuing that vision 30 years later . " There 's so much to draw on from our own planet , " he said , " that we do n't have to think about what a blob from Planet X would look like . " + Rachel Buchholz <p>
