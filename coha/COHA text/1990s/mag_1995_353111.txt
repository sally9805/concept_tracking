YOUNG , GUNG-HO MAJOR SALT ( Cuba Gooding Jr. ) is eager to impress his bosses by describing the fatal cunning of the Motaba virus-how it rapidly turns a healthy body into a bloody , pustulous corpse . " That 's very good , Major , " says Colonel Sam Daniels ( Dustin Hoffman ) wryly . " We 've read that in a book too . " <P> Not quite . They  --  or , rather , producer Arnold Kopelson  --  read it in a New Yorker article in 1992 . " Crisis in the Hot Zone , " Richard Preston 's true story about the near escape of the Ebola virus from a Virginia lab , threw Hollywood into a bidding frenzy , and Kopelson was one of the pursuers . When Preston sold his rights to 20th Century Fox , Kopelson decided to make a fictional plague film , Outbreak . It scurried into production while the Hot Zone project dithered in development and then aborted . So if you want to see a virus epic , Outbreak is it . <P> What you get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes the Preston premise a few steps further . The virus becomes airborne and infects a California town . Now sneezing in a crowded theater can spread an instant epidemic . And a cute monkey may be the innocent agent of genocide . <P> Sam , an Army doctor , is the only person with the expertise , the guts and , dammit , the nobility to solve this apocalyptic poser . Screenwriters Laurence Dworet and Robert Roy Pool have given him a requisition brainy-dishy ex-wife ( Rene Russo ) , an agitated boss ( Morgan Freeman ) , a helpful colleague ( Kevin Spacey , who is very good ) and plucky Major Salt to steer Sam through an unlikely airplane battle at the climax . But in movies like this , a man must stand alone . It 's a mild hoot to watch Certified Great Actor Hoffman play an action hero . Note the Clint-like glint in his eyes , the terse authority he gives such endearingly daft phrases as " Idiocy is our only option . " <P> Sam could stanch the epidemic in a trice were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general ( Donald Sutherland , eyes rolling goofily ) . Appar-ently a killer virus , the threat of plague , a White House crisis-oh , and a pretty blond child set up for a big bad monkey bite-are n't enough for one doomsday movie ; the military has to go bats as well . We can only surmise that back in 1986 , when he produced Platoon , Kopelson contracted a deadly strain of the con-spiracy virus from Oliver Stone . <P> Director Wolfgang Petersen ( Das Boot , In the Line of Fire ) handles it all proficiently and at times artfully , as in two elaborate tracking shots that reveal various levels of biological contamination and the spread of the disease through hospital vents . Still , the whole operation looks musclebound . Outbreak is really about the lumbering , quasimilitary maneuvers that go into big-budget filmmaking . If Preston 's virus story were a virus , the Outbreak team would aim an H-bomb at it . And the Hot Zone people would be sitting around apprehensively , waiting for it to develop .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
