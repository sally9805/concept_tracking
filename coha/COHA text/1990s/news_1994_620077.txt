<p> ' THREE-STRIKES ' LAW 'S FALSE HOPE <p> Editor  --  Robert Wagner 's letter ( " Yes on ' Three Strikes ' , " September 12 ) epitomizes the vacuity of the proponents ' arguments . Aside from his falsely labeling everyone opposing it as " do-gooders and bleeding hearts , " the problem is his major reason for favoring this solution has fallen flat on its face time and time again . <p> The simple fact is that there is n't one historical or recent example where laws providing draconian punishment have reduced the incidence of violent offenses . Be reminded that in olden days , pickpocketing in England was punishable by hanging and yet this minor crime kept taking place . <p> Furthermore , it is erroneous to assume that we currently lack adequate statutory provisions to remove violent offenders from society for long terms . Even before legislation was enacted at the last session , California 's Penal Code contained countless such provisions . <p> The major problem with " three- strikes " solutions , aside from its failure to live up to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which places confining a small class of offenders for life ahead of a host of other pressing public needs like support for adequate higher education , mental and public health programs , and financial aid to local communities , to name a few . <p> Unfortunately , " three-strikes " solutions promise a false dream which can not be fulfilled . <p> CY SHAIN <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> DO N'T BLAME RAT FOR FIRE <p> Editor  --  Your recent story ( " Kangaroo Rat Has Farmers Hopping Mad , " August 30 ) reporting protests against the enforcement provisions of the Endangered Species Act , left the impression that protection of kangaroo rat habitat was what led to the loss of the Ishmael Garcia home in last winter 's tragic firestorm . <p> Your article did not mention that the General Accounting Office ( GAO ) investigated these claims and reported to Congress in July that this fire was fanned by 80 mile-per- hour winds , and jumped concrete barriers , highways and a canal . According to the GAO , homeowners ' efforts to clear vegetation around their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the disking had been performed  --  and spared some homes where disking had not taken place . Firemen said clearing hundreds of feet of ground would not have mattered , because fires of such ferocity can leapfrog more than a mile with searing ashes or hot embers . <p> Finally , the GAO concluded , " on the basis of the experience and views of fire officials and other experts . . . the loss of homes during the California fire was not related to the prohibition of disking in areas inhabited by the Stephens ' kangaroo rat . " <p> It is always tragic when anyone loses their home or belongings to a fire . In last winter 's episode , Mother Nature was ferociously swift , unpredictable and brutal . As the GAO noted , however , neither the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service , the Endangered Species Act nor the Stephens ' kangaroo rat was at fault . <p> PHIL MILLION <p> Fish and Wildlife Service <p> Washington <p> . <p> PAINE 'S WORDS <p> Editor  --  Cornell Professor Isaac Karmnick ( " Christians vs . Jefferson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noted that , during the early years of the Republic , pious Christians found an even more vulnerable target than Thomas Jefferson . Consider the fate of Revolutionary hero Thomas Paine after his return from Europe in 1802 . <p> Paine was rebuffed by old Revolutionary comrades , mauled by an angry mob , refused permission to vote by an election official ( a former Tory ) , denied his rights by Congress , reviled by clergymen on his deathbed , and even refused burial in a Quaker churchyard . Why ? <p> Because he wrote these words in " The Age of Reason " : " I believe in one God , and no more ; and I hope for happiness beyond this life . I believe in the equality of man , and I believe that religious duties consist in doing justice , loving mercy , and endeavoring to make our fellow- creatures happy . . . I do not believe in the creed professed by any church that I know of . All national institutions of churches  --  whether Jewish , Christian , or Turkish  --  appear to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and enslave mankind and monopolize power and profit . " <p> WILLIAM M. BURKE <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> ULSTER TERRORISM <p> Editor  --  Rory Conneely ( Letters , September 6 ) points to British government activity in Northern Ireland as a " direction of death squads , " but describes the IRA 's as a " courageous resistance to foreign rule . " Most British people , probably , see the IRA as the directors of death squads and the British government forces as their often courageous defenders . <p> An Amnesty report released in February 1994 seems to have been one source of Mr. Conneely 's complaints about the British government . The report referred to " mounting evidence " and " repeated allegations " that the government forces had colluded with groups like the militant Ulster Defence Association and Ulster Freedom Fighters , and had a " shoot-to- kill " policy against IRA suspects . <p> The main thrust of the report was not to prove these grave accusations , however , but to beg the British government to have them independently investigated and the findings made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the truth in this bloody business rather than perpetuate ancient prejudice in our use of language ? <p> JOHN BULMAN <p> Belvedere <p> . <p> SOUTHERN GOP <p> Editor  --  Abraham Lincoln and Jefferson Davis must be turning in their graves . The Republican Party is going South ! <p> David Broder of the Washing ton Post reports that in the current House 1 of every 3 members ( Republican ) is a southerner . In 1960 only 1 of every 14 Republican members was a southerner . <p> I guess that 's why Newt Gingrich will be Republican leader in the next Congress . Maybe Republicans will now secede from the Union ! <p> WILLIAM R. TANNER <p> Arcata ( Humboldt County ) <p> THE ALBATROSS <p> Editor  --  The Albatross bookstore had everything going for it : It was a fabulous source of rare books , particularly first editions . If the store did not have what you wanted , they would take your request and find it . People from all over the Bay Area came there to browse . <p> It was centrally located near Powell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shopping areas . Unfortunately , that one block was a lulu  --  a living room for scores of druggies and drug dealers . In the end , it proved too daunting a trip even for a Tenderloin resident like me , and I quit visiting the store . I am looking forward to visiting the new store on Geary , still centrally located , but in a much safer location , as well as the new Clement Street store . <p> LYNN WHITTIER <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> SQUIRE VS . ESQUIRE <p> Editor  --  Paul Larson , presumably a lawyer and therefore a stickler for the correct meaning of words , should note the difference between Squire and Esquire . They are not incompatible , but the lesser does not necessarily lead to the greater . Esquire was the knight in training . Squire is the landowner . Esquire goes behind the name on the card , Squire before it . Anyway , anyone who uses it either way is pompous . <p> GEORGE FULFORD <p> Mill Valley <p> . <p> PAULING ON WAR <p> Editor  --  The excellent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) referred to Pauling 's " opposition to nuclear weapons , " and his 1939 book : " The Nature of the Chemical Bond . " Unfortunately , in my view , it made no reference to Dr. Pauling 's 1958 book : " No More War ! , " in the preface of which he wrote : " We of the mid-20th century live in a most extraordinary time . We are living through that unique epoch in the history of civilization when war will cease to be the means of settling great problems . We shall soon enter upon the continuing period of peace , a period when there will be no more war , when disputes between nations will be settled by the application of man 's power of reason , by international law . <p> " It is the development of great nuclear weapons that requires that war be given up , for all time . The forces that can destroy the world must not be used . <p> " . . . now the facts are at hand , and we can see for ourselves that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depend upon our willingness and ability to cooperate , to work together in a worldwide attack on the great world problems . " <p> Dr. Pauling was an optimist but he cautioned us in 1958 that : " The time has now come for morality to take its proper place in the conduct of world affairs ; the time has now come for the nations of the world to submit to the just regulation of their conduct by international law .
