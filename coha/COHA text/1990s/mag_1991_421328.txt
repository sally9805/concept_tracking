Trees are losing the battle disease , pollution , and drought <p> UNDER GLASS IN AN EXHIBIT at Sequoia National Park stands a head-high auburn slab of wood , sawn from the trunk of an ancient giant . Its growth rings record a succession of climate variations and fire scars across 19 centuries  --  a reassuring testimony to the longevity of our forests . <p> But scientists at Sequoia and other national parks are finding that forests , though enduring and resilient , are increasingly vulnerable to the influence of modem civilization . For example , plant and insect pests , often introduced by humans , have blighted and killed trees and forests in many parks , from conifers in California to palms in Biscayne Bay . Ozone , a common component of smog , is slowing tree growth at Virginia 's Shenandoah National Park and along the Blue Ridge Parkway and threatens the health of conifers in Sequoia , Kings Canyon , and Yosemite national parks . In Maine 's Acadia National Park , needle rot on eastern white pines may be the result of acid fog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ megalopolis to the south . And huge stands of mature lodgepole pines in wide areas of the West , including Grand Teton and Yellowstone parks , are not regenerating well . Fire , which forces their cones open for reseeding , has been too heavily controlled , says Steve Miller , a botanist at the University of Wyoming . <p> A key question for scientists confronting dead and dying forests across the country is : how much of the decline is part of nature 's normal turbulence and how much is human-made ? The results of natural factors such as disease , climate , age , and competition are often difficult to separate from pollution effects , or from each other . Trees in the Sierras , for example , are under assault from severe drought , insects , and ozone pollution simultaneously . Among the most prominent victims are ponderosa pines , Jeffrey pines , and white and red firs . <p> " We 're seeing more dead trees than we 've ever seen before , " says Diane Ewell , an air quality specialist in Sequoia . " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent of the trees you see are dead . " The trees are assaulted by domestic western pine and engraver beetles , and drought has made the trees so weak they ca n't " pitch out " ( fill the holes that bark beetles bore in them ) . Under normal conditions , this defense forces beetles out of the trees , says Forest Service plant pathologist John Pronos . <p> Ironically , as the trees are ravaged by drought , they win some respite from ozone . They photosynthesize less , taking in less ozone through their leaves , says Paul Miller , a Forest Service plant pathologist . But when the drought ends , ozone damage increases . In the Sierras , hourly ozone concentrations often meet or exceed state standards during a third of most summers , Ewell says , and they may be the highest in the nation . Ozone reduces conifer growth and causes whorls of needles to turn yellow and fall off . In some cases only one whorl remains on Ponderosa pine stems that normally have five or six . <p> The Jeffrey pine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Patterson says . It grows at high altitudes in rocky soil , and its roots may tap drought-proof water sources in rocks , making ozone damage worse because its photosynthesis process is not decreased . Jeffreys could decline to the point that they are replaced by other species , such as the incense cedar , that seem to be more resistant to ozone . In recent experiments , ozone damaged needles and reduced growth in sequoia seedlings less than a year old . Controlled amounts of ozone also injured rooted cuttings of larger sequoia branches , according to Miller and Forest Service plant physiologist Nancy Grulke . <p> Fortunately , more mature sequoias do n't seem as vulnerable . Atop a scaffold halfway up a 200-foot sapling last summer , Miller and Grulke enclosed branches and subjected them to several levels of ozone . They are still analyzing the results , but Miller has a hunch they will find little impairment to the photosynthetic activity in trees that size . <p> Ozone pollution in Sequoia may worsen despite new auto emissions standards , Ewell says . The adjacent San Joaquin Valley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new coal-fired plants are springing up nearby , a situation Ewell calls " scary . " In the East , Shenandoah park officials went on record late last year in opposition to one of 20 new power plants proposed in their region , partly because of the threat of increased ozone damage to trees such as tulip poplars and pines . <p> The most talked-about pollutant is " acid rain , " a catch-all phrase for certain chemicals that are discharged into the atmosphere , often from coal-fired power plants , and returned to earth in rain or fog , or in a dry form . Rain and fog with the acidity of lemon juice has been recorded from the Appalachians to the Sierras . A battery of federal studies , concluded late last year , found that masses of red spruce have been dying high on northeastern mountainsides , especially on sites that receive heavy doses of acid rain and fog . Wood samples taken from sick spruce at several locations contained an unnatural surplus of aluminum and a shortage of calcium , a result of changes in soil processes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same imbalance of essential tree nutrients has been found at soil test sites in the Southeast , including Great Smoky Mountains National Park , where spruce growth also is depressed and acid levels are high . <p> But this airborne acid pollution also illustrates the complexity of separating natural from human-made factors . An array of studies , costing millions of dollars , has so far failed either to completely indict or exonerate acid deposits as a major factor in forest declines . Scientists say a final verdict will be years in coming . <p> ANOTHER ENEMY OF TREES in national parks , sometimes called " biological pollution , " is unquestionably caused by humans : we have accidentally introduced a long list of insects and diseases into parklands , especially since the turn of the century . The open oceans no longer function as a barrier to alien pests . Insects and diseases arrive on imported nursery stock and lumber or through other human traffic . They can quickly weaken or destroy native trees , leaving them no time to evolve natural defenses before they are wiped out . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a matter of years . Waves of alien pests , introduced by humans , have moved south through the Atlantic states continually during the past several decades . The now-familiar gypsy moth was introduced from Europe accidentally in 1869 . Moving inexorably southward each season , the moth reached Shenandoah National Park in the 1980s and has been defoliating and killing broad expanses of oak forest there . Regions in the western U. S. have not suffered the same degree of gypsy moth infestations . So far the moth does n't present a serious problem in the West , says Bob Averill , a Forest Service entomologist . <p> The hemlock woolly adelgid , another alien pest , arrived in Shenandoah last year after killing Canadian hemlocks of all sizes in Connecticut and Massachusetts . The Smokies have one of the world 's largest concentrations of virgin Canadian hemlocks , two and three hundred years old or more , forming the dominant stands along streams on Mt . LeConte and in Newfound Gap . The trees are at risk , park personnel say . <p> Nine-tenths of the dogwoods at Catoctin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the mid-1980s of anthracnose , a fungus most scientists believe is an import . U.S. Department of Agriculture geneticist Frank Santamour tested different native varieties of the tree in hopes of finding a resistant strain . In 30 months , they all succumbed . " My God , we just wrung our hands in anguish , " he said . " The disease was just leaping so fast .... " Now , large stands of dogwoods in the Smokies are dead or dying , as the fungus spreads through the southern region . " At least in the mountain areas , " Santamour says , " the dogwoods are pretty much under the gun . " <p> The outlook is grimmer still for butternut , sometimes called white walnut . A recently discovered virus , probably introduced , aborts the nuts in their embryo stage , diminishing reproduction to nearly zero . The tree is currently an official candidate for the federal government 's list of species threatened with extinction . <p> Probably the most visible die-off in the Smokies is in the 48,000-acre " ghost forest " of dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the firs at the park have been killed so far by an imported aphid-like insect , the balsam woolly adelgid . One controversial theory is that the adelgid 's fatal success on Fraser firs is linked to acid rain , which weakens the fir 's natural immune systems . A recent survey found that nearly 75 percent of the 65,000 acres of sprucefir forest in the southern Appalachians lies within the boundaries of the park , and another 10 percent is along the Blue Ridge Parkway . <p> The problems are not always so obvious to park visitors . " It still looks great , " resource management specialist Keith Langdon says . " But internally , in how the forest works , there are some serious problems . " <p> Hundreds of elms have died in the last few years in New England from Dutch elm disease , which is expected to arrive in the Appalachians eventually . Many sugar maples are succumbing to an introduced thrip , a small bug first seen on pear trees in California . " Things that have co-existed for a long time are being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Langdon says . " The more we lose , the more inherently unstable the system becomes . " <p> Chestnuts provide a clear example of this ecological instability . One of the most common trees in the Appalachians until the 1920s , chestnuts vanished by the billions after the introduction of an Asian blight . Chestnuts were not highly palatable to gypsy moths , but the oaks that usually replaced them are . " Now we 're seeing the gypsy moth really speed up , " Langdon says . <p> Some afflictions , like butternut canker , have no known cure . Others , like dogwood anthracnose and the balsam adelgid , can be arrested but not cured by spraying , with fair success . But insecticides and fungicides are expensive to administer . And , especially in a park , they can be more objectionable or hazardous than the pest itself . <p> Unlike red spruce and Fraser fir in the East , trees at high altitudes in the West seem to be little affected yet by drought , bugs , or pollutants . <p> Currently , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the West are growing at an abnormally fast rate , possibly because of higher levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere , park service ecologist Dave Peterson says . Growth has been dramatically faster for about the past 140 years , he notes , coinciding with the start of the Industrial Revolution . Dan Duriscoe , a park service consultant who specializes in ozone research , says the three types of pines may also be more resistant to ozone because they have a slower metabolism and absorb smaller quantities of it . <p> Global warming could affect tree growth at high altitudes as well , says Lisa Graumlich of the Tree Ring Laboratory at the University of Arizona . In this century , the tree line has moved up as much as 30 feet in some regions of the Sierras and the Rockies , she says , and it may go higher if controversial predictions of a 5 to 9-degree-Fahrenheit rise in temperature proves true in the next century . Perhaps for the same reason , more trees are growing in the higher altitudes generally , particularly in subalpine meadows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are nearly powerless  --  like witnesses at a tram wreck , as one biologist put it . Park researchers are concerned that serious ecological disturbances can occur without anyone knowing of them . Langdon said that for an unknown period , the butternut disease went unnoticed : " I think it 's a real indictment of our ability , particularly in national parks where we put a prize on natural systems and trying to monitor them , that we never picked it up . And I include myself in that . There are too few of us and too little money . " <p> Penn State plant pathologist ' John Skelly says federal funding for acid rain research was a start , but long-term studies are needed . " The organisms are 125 years old , and we were given five years to tell whether they 're healthy or not , " he says . " A lot of that was done with a pair of binoculars . You would n't be happy if you went to your doctor and he showed up at his door with a pair of binoculars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been especially concerned about the inadequacies of the Park Service 's science program as threats to the parks increase . " With research representing about 2 percent of the overall NPS budget , the agency is virtually driving a twisting mountain road at night , with its headlights off , " says NPCA natural resources program manager David Simon . " The result is that not only are we missing much of the parks ' beauty and value , but the basic mandate to preserve them is not being carried out . " <p> Predictably , scientists do not speak with one voice about the gravity of the threat to our forests . Skelly , for one , has reservations . " I think air pollution 's important , " he says . " Very important . But I do n't think it 's causing the level of damage that people are leading us to believe . Even though the gypsy moth is introduced , it would have gotten here eventually , and it would have found a banquet . These things are all part of nature . " <p> Introduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Langdon concedes , but human activity has jammed the pace of change into high gear . " And it 's not natural it 's devastating and it 's permanent , unless we take very expensive intervention measures , " he added . <p> If forest ecologies are forced to adapt to a polluted environment during the next century , some of the damage will be invisible at first , such as a shrinking of the gene pool , a process biologists call " depauperization . " Harvard entomologist E.O . Wilson has written that genetic variations form a rich endowment of information , like an immense library whose volumes we have not yet even counted , let alone read . Once lost , the information can not be restored or retrieved . We can only guess as to its significance . <p> Skelly 's research on white pine , an important timber crop , offers strong hints , however . Genetic losses in just one species can be important , even if measured only in narrow economic terms . He found that the genetic families of white pine most vulnerable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fastest in clean air . <p> At Acadia National Park in Maine , geneticist Robert Ecker of the University of New Hampshire is , like Skelly , investigating pollution 's effects on eastern white pines . " We may be looking at the tip of the iceberg , " he says . " The species that are damaged might be called indicator plants , and the long-term effects of some of this exposure to pollutants are not well known . We do n't really even have a good estimate of what proportion of the gene pool is being lost , because trees are just sick enough so they 're not reproducing , but they 're not dying . " <p> Sequoia 's Ewell says environmental policy should respond to the current warning signals : " People require things to be dramatic before they think they are significant . People want to hear that fish are dying , trees are dying . I do n't understand why we have to wait for things to get to that point , because at that point , it 's too late . " <p> Narrowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survival of birds , insects , mammals , and other life forms , as the intricate ecology of the forest shifts in unnatural ways . And , as biologists say , losing parts of the ecosystem is like losing rivets from an airplane . If one or two pop out , little harm is done . But as more are lost , the whole structure threatens to fall apart and crash . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Ghost Forest <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Large stands of dogwoods are dead or dying from a fungus called anthracnose . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Conifers , such as ponderosa pines , are sensitive to ozone pollution . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : High carbon dioxide levels are causing bristlecone pines to grow abnormally fast . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Ozone pollution damages needles and reduces growth in sequoia seedlings . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Bark slides off this tree as it succumbs to Dutch elm disease . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Thirp , an introduced pest , is endangering many sugar maples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red spruce needles , disrupts the balance of essential tree nutrients in the soil , and weakens trees-making them less able to fight pests and disease . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : A tree is infested by egg-laying gypsy moths .
