A POWERFUL AND MOVING WORK OF IMAGINATIVE FICTION <p> LEVENDIS : On Tuesday the 1st of October , improbably dressed as an Explorer Scout , with his great hairy legs protruding from his knee-pants , and his heavily-festooned merit badge sash slantwise across his chest , he helped an old , arthritic black woman across the street at the jammed corner of Wilshire and Western . In fact , she did n't want to cross the street , but he half-pulled , half-dragged her , the old woman screaming at him , calling him a khaki-colored motherfucker every step of the way . <p> LEVENDIS : On Wednesday the 2nd of October , he crossed his legs carefully as he sat in the Boston psychiatrist 's office , making certain the creases of his pants  --  he was wearing the traditional morning coat **26;51;TOOLONG pants  --  remained sharp , and he said to George Aspen Davenport , MD , Ph.D. , FAPA ( who had studied with Ernst Kris and Anna Freud ) , " Yes , that 's it , now you 've got it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lightly cleared his throat and phrased it differently : " Your mouth is ... vanishing ? That is to say , your mouth , the facial feature below your nose , it 's uh disappearing ? " The prospective patient nodded quickly , with a bright smile . " Exactly . " Dr. Davenport made another note , continued to ulcerate the inside of his cheek , then tried a third time : " We 're speaking now  --  heh heh , to maintain the idiom  --  we 're speaking of your lips , or your tongue , or your palate , or your gums , or your teeth , or  --  " The other man sat forward , looking very serious , and replied , " We 're talking all of it , Doctor . The whole , entire , complete aperture and everything around , over , under , and within . My mouth , the allness of my mouth . It 's disappearing . What part of that is giving you a problem ? " Davenport hmmm 'd for a moment , said , " Let me check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teak and glass bookcase against the far wall , beside the window that looked out on crowded , lively Boston Common , and he drew down a capacious volume . He flipped through it for a few minutes , and finally paused at a page on which he poked a finger . He turned to the elegant , gray-haired gentleman in the consultation chair , and he said , " Lipostomy . " His prospective patient tilted his head to the side , like a dog listening for a clue , and arched his eyebrows expectantly , as if to ask yes , and lipostomy is what ? The psychiatrist brought the book to him , leaned down and pointed to the definition . " Atrophy of the mouth . " The gray-haired gentleman , who looked to be in his early sixties , but remarkably well-tended and handsomely turned-out , shook his head slowly as Dr. Davenport walked back around to sit behind his desk . " No , I do n't think so . It does n't seem to be withering , it 's just , well , simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's very simply disappearing . Like the Cheshire cat 's grin . Fading away . " Davenport closed the book and laid it on the desktop , folded his hands atop the volume , and smiled condescendingly . " Do n't you think this might be a delusion on your part ? I 'm looking at your mouth right now , and it 's right there , just as it was when you came into the office . " His prospective patient rose , retrieved his homburg from the sofa , and started toward the door . " It 's a good thing I can read lips , " he said , placing the hat on his head , " because I certainly do n't need to pay your sort of exorbitant fee to be ridiculed . " And he moved to the office door , and opened it to leave , pausing for only a moment to readjust his homburg , which had slipped down , due to the absence of ears on his head . <p> LEVENDIS : On Thursday the 3rd of October , he overloaded his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kibbles ' n Bits ' n Bits ' n Bits , and jumbo boxes of Huggies . And as he wildly careened through the aisles of the Sentry Market in La Crosse , Wisconsin , he purposely engineered a collision between the carts of Kenneth Kulwin , a 47-year-old homosexual who had lived alone since the passing of his father thirteen years earlier , and Anne Gillen , a 35-year-old legal secretary who had been unable to find an escort to take her to her senior prom and whose social life had not improved in the decades since that death of hope . He began screaming at them , as if it had been their fault , thereby making allies of them . He was extremely rude , breathing muscatel breath on them , and finally stormed away , leaving them to sort out their groceries , leaving them to comment on his behavior , leaving them to take notice of each other . He went outside , smelling the Mississippi River , and he let the air out of Anne Gillen 's tires . She would need a lift to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call him " Kenny , " and they would discover that their favorite movie was the 1945 romance , The Enchanted Cottage , starring Dorothy McGuire and Robert Young . <p> LEVENDIS : On Friday the 4th of October , he found an interstate trucker dumping badly sealed cannisters of phenazine in an isolated picnic area outside Phillipsburg , Kansas . He shot him three times in the head . The body was wedged into one of the large , nearly empty trash barrels near the picnic benches . <p> LEVENDIS : On Saturday the 5th of October , he addressed two hundred and forty-four representatives of the country &; western music industry in the Chattanooga Room just off the Tennessee Ballroom of the Opryland Hotel in Nashville . He said to them , " What 's astonishing is not that there is so much ineptitude , slovenliness , mediocrity and downright bad taste in the world ... what is unbelievable is that there is so much good art in the world . Everywhere . " One of the attendees raised her hand and asked , " Are you good , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than twenty seconds , smiled , and replied , " Good , of course ! There 's only one real evil in the world : mediocrity . " They applauded sparsely , but politely . Nonetheless , later at the reception , no one touched the Swedish meatballs , or the rumaki . <p> LEVENDIS : On Sunday the 6th of October , he placed the exhumed remains of Noah 's ark near the eastern summit of a nameless mountain in Kurdistan , where the next infrared surveillance of a random satellite flyby would reveal them . He was careful to seed the area with a plethora of bones , here and there around the site , as well as within the identifiable hull of the vessel . He made sure to place them two-by-two : every beast after his kind , and all the cattle after their kind , and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind , and every fowl after his kind , and every bird of every sort . Two-by-two . Also the bones of pairs of gryphons , unicorns , stegosaurs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dateable 50,000-year-old bones of a relief pitcher for the Boston Red Sox . <p> LEVENDIS : On Monday the 7th of October , he kicked a cat . He kicked it a far distance . To the passersby who watched , there on Galena Street in Aurora , Colorado , he said : " I am an unlimited person , sadly living in a limited world . " When the housewife who planned to call the police yelled at him from her kitchen window , " Who are you ? What is your name ! ? ! " he cupped his hands around his mouth so she would hear him , and he yelled back , " Levendis ! It 's a Greek word . " They found the cat imbarked halfway through a tree . The tree was cut down , and the section with the cat was cut in two , the animal tended by a talented taxidermist who tried to quell the poor beast 's terrified mewling and vomiting . The cat was later sold as bookends . <p> LEVENDIS : On Tuesday the 8th of October , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Michigan , and reported that the blue 1988 Mercedes that had struck and killed two children playing in a street in Hamtramck just after sundown the night before , belonged to a pastry chef whose sole client was a Cosa Nostra pezzonovante . He gave detailed information as to the location of the chop shop where the Mercedes had been taken to be banged out , bondo 'd , and repainted . He gave the license number . He indicated where , in the left front wheel-well , could be found a piece of the skull of the younger of the two little girls . Not only did the piece fit , like the missing section of a modular woodblock puzzle , but pathologists were able to conduct an accurate test that provided irrefutable evidence that would hold up under any attack in court : the medical examiner got past the basic ABO groups , narrowed the scope of identification with the five Rh tests , the M and N tests ( also cap-S and small-s variations ) , the Duffy blood groups , and the Kidd types , both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ validate the rare absence of Jr a , present in most blood-groups but missing in some Japanese-Hawaiians and Samoans . The little girl 's name was Sherry Tualaulelei . When the homicide investigators learned that the pastry chef , his wife , and their three children had gone to New York City on vacation four days before the hit-and-run , and were able to produce ticket stubs that placed them seventh row center of the Martin Beck Theater , enjoying the revival of Guys and Dolls , at the precise moment the Mercedes struck the children , the Organized Crime Unit was called in , and the scope of the investigation was broadened . Sherry Tualaulelei was instrumental in the conviction and thirty-three year imprisonment of the pastry chef 's boss , Sinio " Sally Comfort " Conforte , who had " borrowed " a car to sneak out for a visit to his mistress . <p> LEVENDIS : On Wednesday the 9th of October , he sent a fruit basket to Patricia and Faustino Evangelista , a middle-aged couple in Norwalk , Connecticut , who had given to their surviving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to kill himself . The accompanying note read : Way to go , sensitive Mom and Dad ! <p> LEVENDIS : On Thursday the 10th of October , he created a cure for bone-marrow cancer . Anyone could make it : the juice of fresh lemons , spiderwebs , the scrapings of raw carrots , the opaque and whitish portion of the toenail called the lunula , and carbonated water . The pharmaceutical cartel quickly hired a prestigious Philadelphia PR firm to throw its efficacy into question , but the AMA and FDA ran accelerated tests , found it to be potent , with no deleterious effects , and recommended its immediate use . It had no effect on AIDS , however . Nor did it work on the common cold . Remarkably , physicians praised the easing of their workload . <p> LEVENDIS : On Friday the 11th of October , he lay in his own filth on the sidewalk outside the British Embassy in Rangoon , holding a begging bowl . He was half-hidden by the angle of the high wall from sight of the military guards on post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let out of a jitney just up the street , having paid her fare and having tipped as few rupees as necessary to escape a strident rebuke by the driver , smoothed the peplum of her shantung jacket over her hips , and marched imperially toward the Embassy gates . As she came abaft the derelict , he rose on one elbow and shouted at her ankles , " Hey , lady ! I write these pomes , and I sell ' em for a buck inna street , an ' it keeps juvenile delinquents offa the streets so 's they do n't spit on ya ! So whaddaya think , y'wanna buy one ? " The matron did not pause , striding toward the gates , but she said snappishly , " You 're a businessman . Do n't talk art . " <p> This is a story titled <p> THE ROUTE OF ODYSSEUS <p> " You will find the scene of Odysseus 's wanderings when you find the cobbler who sewed up the bag of winds . " Eratosthenes , late 3rd century , B.C. <p> LEVENDIS : On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he came to a place near Weimar in southwest Germany . He did not see the photographer snapping pictures of the scene . He stood among the cordwood bodies . It was cold for the spring ; and even though he was heavily clothed , he shivered . He walked down the rows of bony corpses , looking into the black holes that had been eye sockets , seeing an endless chicken dinner , the bones gnawed clean , tossed like jackstraws in heaps . The stretched-taut groins of men and women , flesh tarpaulins where passion had once smoothed the transport from sleep to wakefulness . Entwined so cavalierly that here a woman with three arms , and there a child with the legs of a sprinter three times his age . A woman 's face , looking up at him with soot for sight , remarkable cheekbones , high and lovely , she might have been an actress . Xylophones for chests and torsos , violin bows that had waved goodbye and hugged grandchildren and lifted in toasts to the passing of traditions , gourd whistles between eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not remain merely an instrument himself . He sank to his haunches , crouched and wept , burying his head in his hands as the photographer took shot after shot , an opportunity like a gift from the editor . Then he tried to stop crying , and stood , and the cold cut him , and he removed his heavy topcoat and placed it gently over the bodies of two women and a man lying so close and intermixed that it easily served as coverlet for them . He stood among the cordwood bodies , 24 April 1945 , Buchenwald , and the photograph would appear in a book published forty-six years later , on Saturday the 12th of October . The photographer 's roll ran out just an instant before the slim young man without a topcoat took the sidestep . Nor did he hear the tearful young man say , " Sertsa . " In Russian , sertsa means soul . <p> LEVENDIS : On Sunday the 13th of October , he did nothing . He rested . When he thought about it , he grew annoyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived it , " he said . But he thought : to hell with it ; even God knocked off for a day <p> LEVENDIS : On Monday the 14th of October , he climbed up through the stinking stairwell shaft of a Baltimore tenement , clutching his notebook , breathing through his mouth to block the smell of mildew , garbage , and urine , focusing his mind on the apartment number he was seeking , straining through the evening dimness in the wan light of one bulb hanging high above , barely illuminating the vertical tunnel , as he climbed and climbed , straining to see the numbers on the doors , going up , realizing the tenants had pulled the numbers off the doors to foil him and welfare investigators like him , stumbling over something oily and sobbing jammed into a corner of the last step , losing his grip on the rotting bannister and finding it just in time , trapped for a moment in the hopeless beam of washed-out light falling from above , poised in mid-tumble and then regaining his grip , hoping the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could knock off for the day , hurry back downtown and crosstown and take a shower , going up till he had reached the topmost landing and finding the number scratched on the door-frame , and knocking , getting no answer , knocking again , hearing first the scream , then the sound of someone beating against a wall , or the floor , with a heavy stick , and then another scream so closely following the first that it might have been one scream only , and he threw himself against the door , and it was old but never had been well-built , and it came off its hinges in one rotten crack , and he was inside , and the most beautiful young black woman he had ever seen was tearing the rats off her baby . He left the check on the kitchen table , he did not have an affair with her , he did not see her fall from the apartment window , six storeys into a courtyard , and never knew if she came back from the grave to escape the rats that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , and so was not there when what she became flowed back up through the walls of the tenement to absorb him and meld with him and become one with him as he lay sleeping penitently on the filthy floor of the topmost apartment . He left the check , and none of that happened . <p> LEVENDIS : On Tuesday the 15th of October , he stood in the Greek theatre at Aspendos , Turkey , a structure built two thousand years earlier , so acoustically perfect that every word spoken on its stage could be heard with clarity in any of its thirteen thousand seats , and he spoke to a little boy sitting high above him . He uttered Count Von Manfred 's dying words , Schumann 's overture , Byron 's poem : " Old man , ' t is not so difficult to die . " The child smiled and waved . He waved back , then shrugged . They became friends at a distance . It was the first time someone other than his mother , who was dead , had been kind to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reminder that there was a smile out there on the wind . The little boy looked down the rows and concentric rows of seats : the man ' way down there was motioning for him to come to him . The child , whose name was Orhon , hopped and hopped , descending to the center of the ring as quickly as he could . As he came to the core , and walked out across the orchestra ring , he studied the man . This person was very tall , and he needed a shave , and his hat had an extremely wide brim , like the hat of Kul , the man who made weekly trips to Ankara , and he wore a long overcoat far too hot for this day . Orhon could not see the man 's eyes because he wore dark glasses that reflected the sky . Orhon thought this man looked like a mountain bandit , only dressed more impressively . Not wisely for a day as torpid as this , but more impressively than Bilge and his men , who raided the farming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they smiled at each other , this person said to Orhon , " I am an unlimited person living in a limited world . " The child did not know what to say to that . But he liked the man . " Why do you wear such heavy wool today ? I am barefoot . " He raised his dusty foot to show the man , and was embarrassed at the dirty cloth tied around his big toe . And the man said , " Because I need a safe place to keep the limited world . " And he unbuttoned his overcoat , and held open one side , and showed Orhon what he would inherit one day , if he tried very hard not to be a despot . Pinned to the fabric , each with the face of the planet , were a million and more timepieces , each one the Earth at a different moment , and all of them purring erratically like dozing sphinxes . And Orhon stood there , in the heat , for quite a long while , and listened to the ticking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 16th of October , he chanced upon three skinheads in Doc Martens ' and cheap black leatherette , beating the crap out of an interracial couple who had emerged from the late show at the La Salle Theater in Chicago . He stood quietly and watched . For a long while . <p> LEVENDIS : On Thursday the 17th of October , he chanced upon three skinheads in Doc Martens ' and cheap black leatherette , beating the crap out of an interracial couple who had stopped for a bite to eat at a Howard Johnson 's near King of Prussia on the Pennsylvania Turnpike . He removed the inch-and-a-half-thick ironwood dowe he always carried beside his driver 's seat and , holding the 2-1/2 long rod at its centerpoint , laid alongside his pants leg so it could not be seen in the semi-darkness of the parking lot , he came up behind the three as they kicked the black woman and the white man lying between parked cars . He tapped the tallest of the trio on his shoulder , and when the boy turned around  --  he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back a step , slid the dowel up with his right hand , gripped it tightly with his left , and drove the end of the rod into the eye of the skinhead , punching through behind the socket and pulping the brain . The boy flailed backward , already dead , and struck his partners . As they turned , he was spinning the dowel like a baton , faster and faster , and as the stouter of the two attackers charged him , he whipped it around his head and slashed straight across the boy 's throat . The snapping sound ricocheted off the dark hillside beyond the restaurant . He kicked the third boy in the groin , and when he dropped , and fell on his back , he kicked him under the chin , opening the skinhead 's mouth ; and then he stood over him , and with both hands looked around the pole , as hard as he could , he piledrove the wooden rod into the kid 's mouth , shattering his teeth , and turning the back of his skull to flinders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then he helped the man and his wife to their feet , and bullied the manager of the Howard Johnson 's into actually letting them lie down in his office till the State Police arrived . He ordered a plate of fried clams and sat there eating pleasurably until the cops had taken his statement . <p> LEVENDIS : On Friday the 18th of October , he took a busload of Mormon schoolchildren to the shallow waters of the Great Salt Lake in Utah , to pay homage to the great sculptor Smithson by introducing the art-ignorant children to the Spiral Jetty , an incongruously gorgeous line of earth and stone that curves out and away like a thought lost in the tide . " The man who made this , who dreamed it up and then made it , you know what he once said ? " And they ventured that no , they did n't know what this Smithson sculptor had said , and the man who had driven the bus paused for a dramatic moment , and he repeated Smithson 's words : " Establish enigmas , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you had to be there , " he said , shrugging . " Who 's for ice cream ? " And they went to a Baskin-Robbins . <p> LEVENDIS : On Saturday the 19th of October , he filed a thirty-million-dollar lawsuit against the major leagues in the name of Alberda Jeanette Chambers , a 19-year-old lefthander with a fade-away fast ball clocked at better than 96 mph ; a dipsy-doodle slider that could do a barrell-roll and clean up after itself ; an ERA of 2.10 ; who could hit from either side of the plate with a batting average of 360 ; who doubled as a peppery little shortstop working with a trapper 's mitt of her own design ; who had been refused tryouts with virtually every professional team in the United States ( also Japan ) from the bigs all the way down to the Pony League . He filed in Federal District Court for the Southern Division of New York State , and told Ted Koppel that Allie Chambers would be the first female player , mulatto or otherwise , in the Baseball Hall of Fame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he drove out and around through the streets of Raleigh and Durham , North Carolina , in a rented van equipped with a public address system , and he endlessly reminded somnambulistic pedestrians and families entering eggs ' n grits restaurants ( many of these adults had actually voted for Jesse Helms and thus were in danger of losing their sertsa ) that perhaps they should ignore their bibles today , and go back and reread Shirley Jackson 's short story , " One Ordinary Day , with Peanuts . " <p> This is a story titled <p> THE DAFFODILS THAT ENTERTAIN <p> LEVENDIS : On Monday the 21st of October , having taken the sidestep , he wandered through that section of New York City known as the Tenderloin . It was 1892 . Crosstown on 24th Street from Fifth Avenue up to Seventh , then he turned uptown and walked slowly on Seventh to 40th . Midtown was rife with brothels , their red lights shining through the shadows , challenging the wan gaslit streetlamps . The Edison and Swan United Electric Light Co. , Ltd. , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a Greek-sounding name who had canvassed the prostitution district west of Broadway only five years earlier , urging the installation of Mr. Joseph Wilson Swan and Mr. Thomas Alva Edison 's filament lamps : painted crimson , fixed above the ominously yawning doorways of the area 's many houses of easy virtue . He passed an alley on 36th Street , and heard a woman 's voice in the darkness complaining , " You said you 'd give me two dollars . You have to give it to me first ! Stop ! No , first you got ta give me the two dollars ! " He stepped into the alley , let his eyes acclimate to the darkness so total , trying to hold his breath against the stench ; and then he saw them . The man was in his late forties , wearing a bowler and a shin-length topcoat with an astrakhan collar . The sound of horse-drawn carriages clopped loudly on the bricks beyond the alley , and the man in the astrakhan looked up , toward the alley mouth . His face was strained , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a footpad or shoulder-hitter or bully-boy pimp to charge to her defense . He had his fly unbuttoned and his thin , pale penis extended ; the girl was backed against the alley wall , the man 's left hand at her throat ; and he had hiked up her apron and skirt and petticoats , and was trying to get his right hand into her drawers . She pushed against him , but to no avail . He was large and ' strong . But when he saw the other man standing down there , near the mouth of the alley , he let her garments drop , and fished his organ back into his pants , but did n't waste time buttoning-up . " You there ! Like to watch your betters at work , do you ? " The man who had done the sidestep spoke softly : " Let the girl go . Give her the two dollars , and let her go . " The man in the bowler took a step toward the mouth of the alley , his hands coming up in a standard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a snort that was rude and derisive : " Oh so , fancy yourself something of the John L. Sullivan , do you , captain ? Well , let 's see how you and I and the Marquis Q get along ... " and he danced forward , hindered considerably by the bulky overcoat . As he drew within double arm's-length of his opponent the younger man drew the taser , the charge lifting him off his feet and driving him back into the brick wall so hard that the filaments were wrenched loose , and the potential fornicator fell forward , his eyes rolled up in his head . Fell forward so hard he smashed three of his front teeth , broken at the gum-line . The girl tried to run , but the alley was a dead end . She watched as the man with the strange weapon came to her . She could barely see his face , and there had been all those killings with that Jack the Ripper in London a few years back , and there was talk that this Jack had been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was terrified . Her name was Poppy Skurnik , she was an orphan , and she worked way downtown as a pieceworker in a shirtwaist factory . She made one dollar and sixty-five cents a week , for six days of labor , from seven in the morning until seven at night , and it was barely enough to pay for her lodgings at Baer 's Rents . So she " supplemented " her income with a stroll in the Tenderloin , twice a week , never more , and prayed that she could continue to avoid the murderous attentions of gentlemen who liked to cripple girls after they 'd topped them , continue to avoid the pressures of pimps and boy friends who wanted her to work for them , continu e to avoid the knowledge that she was no longer " decent " but was also a long way from winding up in one of these red-light whore-houses . He took her gently by the hand , and started to lead her out of the alley , carefully stepping over the unconscious molester . When they reached the street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how young he was , and how premierely he was dressed , she also smiled . She was extraordinarily attractive , and the young man tipped his hat and spoke to her kindly , inquiring as to her name , and where she lived , and if she would like to accompany him for some dinner . And she accepted , and he hailed a carriage , and took her to Delmonico 's for the finest meal she had ever had . And later , much later , when he brought her to his townhouse on upper Fifth Avenue , in the posh section , she was ready to do anything he required of her . But instead , all he asked was that she allow him to give her a hundred dollars in exchange for one second of small pain . And she felt fear , because she knew what these nabobs were like , but a hundred dollars ! So she said yes , and he asked her to bare her left buttock , and she did it with embarrassment , and there was exactly one second of mosquito @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he had injected her with penicillin , with a cool and fragrant wad of cotton batting . " Would you like to sleep the night here , Poppy ? " the young man asked . " My room is down the hall , but I think you 'll be very comfortable in this one . " And she was worried that he had done something awful to her , like inject her with a bad poison , but she did n't feel any different , and he seemed so nice , so she said yes , that would be a dear way to spend the evening , and he gave her ten ten-dollar bills , and wished her a pleasant sleep , and left the room , having saved her life , for she had contracted syphilis the week before , though she did n't know it ; and within a year she would have been unable , by her appearance alone , to get men in the streets ; and would have been let go at the shirtwaist factory ; and would have been seduced and sold into one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been dead within another two years . But this night she slept well , between cool sheets with hand-embroidered lace edging , and when she rose the next day he was gone , and no one told her to leave the townhouse , and so she stayed on from day to day for years , and eventually married and gave birth to three children , one of whom grew to maturity , married , had a child who became an adult and saved the lives of millions of innocent men , women , and children . But that night in 1892 she slept a deep , sweet , recuperative and dreamless sleep . <p> LEVENDIS : On Tuesday the 22nd of October , he visited a plague of asthmatic toads on lisalmi , a small town in Finland ; a rain of handbills left over from World War II urging the SS troops to surrender on Chejudo , an island off the southern coast of Korea ; a shock wave of forsythia on Linares in Spain ; and a fully-restored 1926 Ahrens-Fox model RK fire engine on a mini-mall in Clarksville @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of October , he corrected every history book in America so that they no longer called it The Battle of Bunker Hill , but rather Breeds Hill where , in fact , the engagement of 17 June 1775 had taken place .

The former was in his job description ; the latter was a matter of personal pique . <p> LEVENDlS : On Thursday the 24th of October , he revealed to the London Times and Paris-Match the name of the woman who had stood on the grassy knoll , behind the fence , in Dallas that day , and fired the rifle shots that killed John F.

Eugene Y. Grasso , USAF , who had gone down under fire twenty-eight years earlier . He returned him to his family in Anchorage , Alaska , where his wife , remarried , refused to see him but his daughter whom he had never seen , would . They fell in love , and lived together in Anchorage , where their story provided endless confusion to the ministers of several faiths . <p> LEVENDIS : On Tuesday the 29th of October , he destroyed the last bits of evidence that would have led to answers to the mysteries of the disappearances of Amelia Earhart , Ambrose Bierce , Benjamin Bathurst and Jimmy Hoffa . He washed the bones and placed them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On Wednesday the 30th of October , he traveled to New Orleans , Louisiana , where he waited at a restaurant in Metairie for the former head of the Ku Klux Klan , now running for state office , to show up to meet friends .
