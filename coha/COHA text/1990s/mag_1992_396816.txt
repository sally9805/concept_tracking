For years , I 've had the same strange , recurring sports dream : to go skiing in the morning and to play a round of golf in the afternoon . This seemed like a crazy fantasy , or perhaps the first signs of schizophrenia , until a press release arrived at my home in New York 's Westchester County last winter that was headed , " Golf and Ski on the Same Day at Wintergreen . " Now , Wintergreen would not qualify as most people 's idea of a destination ski resort . For one thing , it is located in the state of Virginia  --  and who would think of going south to ski ? For another , its dimensions read like a local practice hill : 1,000 feet of vertical , five chair lifts , 10 slopes . Needless to say , most of the white stuff on these 10 slopes has fallen only as far as the snow gun shot it skyward . Fantasies are not fulfilled on these statistics . On the other hand , Wintergreen has a golf course described by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courses in the country , " one that " accents playability and beauty . " So maybe we 'll call it half a fantasy . In late March , in order to adequately prepare for this semi-fantasy , I found myself joining a handful of fellow golfing addicts at a local year-round golf range pounding out balls in five inches of new snow in a wind chill of minus 11 . Most people find they ca n't immediately recover the previous season 's skills at any sport when there has been a layoff of several months . But skiing skills seem to return with the same intensity as a sudden submersion into deep water : You do it or you die . Golf , on the other hand , has no urgencies that force the player to harness lost abilities to preserve life and limb . Not even an ego crushed by errant hits can swiftly retrieve the subtle movements , the precise timing , and the unnatural grace of the golf swing . But , poor hitting or not , I was determined to do this one-day ski/golf experience . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early because the lifts were starting at 9 A.M. and I wanted to ski and see as much as possible before noon . I soon discovered this was no problem . The lift ticket , at $36 , was a dual-purpose bargain that covered the greens fees as well as skiing . Details like moving the ticket from ski clothing to golf bag I would think about later  --  I was , after all , distracted by the beauty of the Virginia countryside . I had arrived the previous evening , well after dark , so I had no sense that Wintergreen is an upside-down mountain . A huge development of condos sprawls across a ridge , along with a conference facility , sports center , and a village consisting of an inn , several shops , restaurants , rental operations , and offices  --  all of this above the ski slopes . Wintergreen is also high , at an elevation of 4,200 feet , giving snowmaking more opportunity to cover the slopes than would be expected at this latitude . Unfortunately , even the best intentions last ski season could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so only about half of the slopes at Wintergreen were open . The snow was , however , very deep and well groomed , making runs like Cliffhanger and Big Acorn , with a mix of steeper pitches and runouts , lots of fun . The majority of the terrain is easy , though a well-populated beginner section keeps the really easy runs distinct from the moderately easy ones . Fun though it was , it did n't take long for me to see all the slopes and accomplish my skiing objective . I changed clothes and took my parka with its dual-purpose ticket along with my golf clubs and headed for the Stoney Creek Golf Course . The drive to Stoney Creek is about 12 miles , mostly downhill to a valley that rests at 800 feet above sea level , producing at least a 15-degree temperature difference from that up at the ski area . Due to this temperature difference , the course is open year-round . On my ski/golf day , the temperatures were in the low 50s on the mountain and the mid 60s in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resort that has multiple seasons on two levels . Spring starts early in the valley and moves to the mountain , then fall starts early on the mountain and moves to the valley . But the South has its own version of winter , different from snow-laden New England or the Rockies , with trees bare of leaves and tan-colored Bermuda grass on the golf course sheered bristle-short like a vast Marine haircut . The pros at the golf shop greeted me enthusiastically , and told me I was only the third person to play the course that day . An uncrowded course is a good way to start the season and deal with the inevitable hooks and slices of a rusty swing . By the third hole , I caught up with Martha and John Sim of Yorktown , Virginia , who own a house on the mountain , which they use as a summer retreat  --  much cooler than the humid , hot valley  --  as well as a winter place for skiing . John said he has done the ski/golf thing several times . He said the unusually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be open through the winter months , although it is normally open only until December and then from mid February , while skiing lasts from December through March . The first nine holes at Stoney Creek are fairly flat , allowing scenic views of the mountains all around . The back nine holes are surrounded by dense woods mixed with rock outcroppings  --  the kind of terrain where it is easy to imagine soldiers with loaded muskets . However , the course seems very forgiving because it is wide and recovery from the rough is fairly easy . Early spring golf has its own odd dilemmas . The greens are hard and fast , causing putts to plane past the holes . Carts are not allowed on the fairways , making club selection difficult and inconvenient . No-see-ums swarm and nip at crucial times , like the moment of a putt or the backswing of a drive . Two hours of skiing combined with four hours of golf , with nary a break between , makes for a solid day  --  just as the fantasy prescribed . To aid in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a country inn in the valley to a high-style dining room on the mountain , along with three lounges . For the really energetic , there is also night skiing . As much fun as doing it , however , is watching the watchers watch the skiers . Only 43 miles from Charlottesville and 113 miles from Richmond , Wintergreen attracts scores of skiers for the 7 to 11 P.M. session and even more viewers for the Southern spectacle of people sliding on snow . Repeating the ski/golf experience the next day , I met Tim Carwile , a lawyer from Waynesville , Virginia , and a weekend patroller at Wintergreen . He conceded that skiing and golfing in one day is okay , but he had worked out an even more fantasy-filled three-day schedule : Friday is the warm-up day , with morning skiing and afternoon golf , followed by a few miles of biking around the cart paths on the course . Saturday is tennis in the morning at Rodes Farm down the valley , followed by trout fishing in Stoney Creek , and then a swim in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sunday is for sleeping late or jogging , then an exercise and whirlpool session at Wintergarden , followed by brunch at the Copper Mine restaurant . This allows time to buy the afternoon lift ticket for $29 , which permits skiing from 12:30 until 11 P.M. Go to Virginia to ski ? Well , maybe with a little golf , tennis , fishing , biking , working out , and swimming . Real fantasies are made of this .

WHERE ELSE TO DOUBLE YOUR PLEASURE Around the country , dozens of ski areas are tapping into the potential of skiers ' fantasy vacations that combine skiing and golf . Some areas have ticket deals that include skiing and greens fees , some do n't , but almost everywhere the prices are reduced for both activities in the early spring . In the Northeast , ski/golf combinations are offered at several areas , but availability largely depends upon the weather . A big snowstorm late in the season followed by moderate temperatures is more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mountain at a time when a golf course can be opened without too much moisture on the fairways . In the West , areas that are traditionally open late because they are located at high altitudes are very likely to have overlapping seasons between the two sports . Skiing can get mushy around noon , so skiers grab their golf clubs for a change of pace . ALPINE MEADOWS , CALIFORNIA : May is the usual closing period for the ski area , but golf starts in March or April .

While there are no combination deals , each year there is a ski/golf tournament with teams competing for the best overall scores for ski racing and golf .
