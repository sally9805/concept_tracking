I liked Gretchen better when she was n't trying to kill me . Here 's what she used : a Colt .38 ; a heavy-handled hatchet ; a pair of powder-blue knitting needles ( one in each ear , a quick thrust , and I 'd be gonzo , Gretchen said ) ; and a gleaming silver-tipped syringe , its cylinder filled with something thick and yellow . <p> This was the summer of 1969 . Gretchen was twelve , I was eight , and one morning Mother and Dad shoveled our clothes into five paper sacks and dropped us at Nana 's house . They 'd packed the ' 63 Oldsmobile convertible with Dad 's Indian print shirts and blue jeans , Mother 's ankle-length peasant skirts , a bulletin board with pictures of Gretchen and me , and a box full of demo tapes . They 'd handed the keys of the Disc Den , their used record shop , to their only employee , Willis Ferguson . They kissed us all  --  " You take care of my wild things , " Dad said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll send for you guys soon , " Mother called . " California does n't know what 's coming  --  we 're gon na slay them . " They waved and slid on their wire-rimmed sunglasses . Then they headed to the coast to become stars in the music industry . <p> The first death happened right there , before I 'd stopped waving goodbye . Suddenly I felt Gretchen 's finger poked up behind my ear . " Feel that ? " she said . " That 's a needle knife . It 's a weapon so thin and so sharp I could push it through your brain and it would come out on the other side in less than three seconds . " <p> " Leave your brother be , " Nana said and gave Gretchen 's hand a nudge . <p> " Do n't forget , " Gretchen whispered , so close I felt the soft spray of spit in my ear . " I 'm watching you every second , Danny . " <p> Every day , Gretchen renumbered Nana 's wall calendar , covering the real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing in something new : the number of days since Mother and Dad had left . We all lived by this calendar now : twelve days , twenty-seven days , fifty-nine days . Gretchen would store the marker in the drawer under the calendar , so she would n't have to look for it the next day . Then she 'd come looking for me . <p> " It 's your fault , " she said the day of my death by hatchet , kind of early on , day seventeen . A postcard had arrived from Mother and Dad that morning , and Gretchen carefully leaned it against a lamp before turning to me . They were crashing with friends in Haight-Ashbury , Dad had written . It was a wild and wonderful place . They missed us madly . " I woke up with a sore throat , and you 've been snotty and disgusting all week , " Gretchen said . " You 're gon na pay , Danny . " <p> I shrugged . I 'd stopped arguing with Gretchen after the first few deaths . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make Gretchen almost cheerful . Besides , my stutter had gotten worse since we moved to Nana 's . Sometimes I got so stuck chugging over the same syllable that I just gave up talking altogether . <p> Gretchen laid my head on the hassock Nana used to hold up her feet while she watched the TV , and held her hand high . " This is the heaviest hatchet in the world , " she said . " It 's not too sharp , so it 's probably gon na really hurt when it hits you , but it 's so heavy it 'll chop your head clear off your neck . " <p> As the blade descended , I did n't even shut my eyes . The worn leather crackled against my cheek . The bridge strung with lights on our parents ' postcard reshuffled under my sideways gaze . It looked like a lit dinosaur 's back . Or the crown Mother made for Gretchen 's last Halloween costume . It looked like a brilliant , tipping ladder . <p> Gretchen and I slept in Dad 's old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bunk , I watched the blue curtains puff out over the windowsill and flatten against the screen . I ca n't say why , but my stutter left me in that bed , and in the dark I replayed memories of Mother and Dad while Gretchen scratched in her journal above me . <p> " Remember dancing to ' Born to Be Wild ' ? " I 'd ask Gretchen . It was Dad 's favorite song , and he 'd spin us across the living room floor , singing , " Getcher motor RUN-ning , head out on the HIGH-WAY . " " Remember Mother playing ' Pop Goes the Weasel ' on the piano ? " It was better than TV , these pictures in the dark  --  I could hear Mother tweedling the piano keys . I could smell the lemon lozenges on her breath . <p> But Gretchen did n't want to hear it . " Danny , " she said , " if you do n't stop talking right now , I 'm going to kill you . " Gretchen did n't like me talking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell they were almost all she thought about . I 'd snuck a look at her diary one afternoon while she was picking zucchini flowers for Nana to fry . Three times , Gretchen had started writing letters to our parents . On one left-hand page she 'd written dad dad dad dad from top to bottom , and on the facing page she 'd done the same with Mother  --  though she wrote mother mom mother mom mother mom , as though she did n't remember what to call her . I did n't see the point , and Gretchen must have gotten tired of writing the same thing over and over ; she 'd penciled big dark X 's over both pages . <p> Mother and Dad called as often as they could . Gretchen drew little green phone handles on the calendar when they did , with loops on the bottom to represent the cord . <p> On day thirty-nine , they told us they had a weekly gig at a coffee bar in the Haight . They were sending us a flyer ; we should look for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after Gretchen and me , a name that their audiences found mysterious and cool . " You thought we were hippies , " Mother laughed . " You should see the folks on the other side of the mike . " <p> Gretchen and I stood with the phone receiver between us . Mother and Dad both talked at once , so they must have been doing the same . I pictured them standing at a pay phone in a magical neighborhood , miles away from our house in Cleveland . The place was filled with people who looked just like Mother and Dad , their hair swinging down their backs , all of them humming and rapping out rhythms on their knees . <p> Gretchen nodded seriously at the space in front of her while Mother and Dad talked and told them she loved her swimming lessons at the municipal pool  --  an outright lie . <p> My own mouth started before my head caught up with it . <p> " Ww-w-w-w , " I said . Gretchen elbowed me . It mortified her when I stuttered . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I leaned into that W until I broke through to the sentence on the other side : " When are you coming back ? " <p> No sound came through the line . <p> Nana peeled my fingers from the receiver gently as she pulled the borers off her tomato plants . <p> " Stu-pid , " Gretchen whispered to me . " You are so stupid . It wo n't work asking them that way . " I did n't know what she was talking about . <p> Later , she tied my hands behind me with Nana 's nylons . She held the black Magic Marker in her hand . " This is a needle , " she said , " a big thick one , it 's called a ' syringe . ' I 've filled it with this special mixture  --  only I know how to make it . It 's yellow , " she said . " You like yellow , do n't you , Danny ? " <p> I nodded yes . Gretchen looked almost sad . " You wo n't really notice it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your arm , and the yellow mixture will glue up everything inside you , and then you 'll just stop breathing and talking and everything . Okay ? " she asked . <p> " Okay , " I said , no stutter at all . She pressed the marker gently to my arm . <p> It was hot that summer , and Nana took us on the bus to the municipal swimming pool three or four times a week . I liked those days : we saw kids from our old neighborhood , and Timmy Walston and I flung ourselves into the pool like cannonballs . After her swimming lessons , Gretchen talked to her girlfriends , all of them huddled together on terry-cloth towels . Sometimes , especially when the girls were eating in bunches around their mothers ' chairs , their moms doling out napkins to catch the plum juice sliding down their chins , Gretchen sat next to Nana , slurping a frozen lemonade , her bangs falling over her eyes . She looked like Mother herself then , with her black hair reaching nearly to her waist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gretchen how Mother and Dad were doing . Gretchen and Peggy were sitting on the concrete beside Mrs. Judson 's pool chair playing Slap-Jack . Their freckled hands flew as they whacked the cards . I sat at the base of Nana 's chair sucking a root-beer pop . <p> " They 're on a business trip , " Gretchen said . She slammed her hand on the pile of cards and swept them to her . <p> " A business trip , " Mrs. Judson said . " They must have big plans for the Disc Den . " <p> " Gretchen  --  " I said , and she shot me a look . We both knew she was lying . Since about a week after I 'd asked Mother and Dad when they were coming home , they 'd been sending mail nearly daily . Sometimes the letters were long-descriptions of the Golden Gate Park and Bridge , stories about all the musicians they were meeting . Other times they were shorter-poems or lists of their sets Dad scrawled on the back of a napkin from the club where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd made to advertise themselves . In its center was a grainy picture of Dad on a stool , leaning over his guitar , and Mother singing with her head flung back , her hair flying out behind her like Nana 's sheets on the laundry line . The flyer said , Come hear Gredan : We 're a sound like no other . On the back , Mother wrote : " Do you guys miss us as much as we miss you ? ? ? " <p> " My father 's going to start working in the insurance business , " Gretchen said . " He 's gon na be a big executive . He 's got the suits already . " <p> I hurled my root-beer pop at Gretchen , and it landed against her bathing suit with a soft crushing sound . What was she doing lying about our mother and dad ? <p> Eventually , Nana was able to pull us from the pool with Mrs. Judson 's help . I was still shouting Big fat liar at Gretchen , and she was crying and spitting out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the ride home . Nana stomped down the steps at our bus stop and did n't look back at either of us . But I was n't so mad at Gretchen anymore . She 'd chewed on her hangnails the whole ride , and by the time we were home her finger ends were chomped and purplish . <p> I thought Gretchen might have an extra-complicated death for me , and I hung around the yard , waiting for her . But she just walked up to our room and lay on the top bunk . Nana crashed pans in the kitchen and muttered , " Fools . Fools . " I asked who she meant , but she did n't say . <p> On day sixty-four , Mother and Dad called , but Nana did n't let us talk to them . She sat at the kitchen table and scribbled a tangle of black circles on her grocery pad while she said , " Yes , I know , " into the phone . When she saw Gretchen and me in the kitchen door , she pointed us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ratcheted her elbow around my throat and said : " Know how easily I could snap your neck ? " I did n't move . She swung her arm away . " Never mind , " Gretchen said . She scuffed off to our room and clicked the lock shut . <p> Nana cooked an enormous dinner that night . She laid placemats at one end of the table and neatly piled her magazines , bills , and all the letters we 'd received from Mother and Dad at the other . While Gretchen and I sat , she stacked eight hefty pork chops onto her serving platter and dribbled her special orange-juice gravy over them . She heaped mashed potatoes onto our plates , spooned up peas and carrots , slid thick tomato slices from her garden next to the other vegetables . <p> Mother and Dad tended toward spaghetti and salads . I dug in . The pork juice ran rich in my mouth . Gretchen did n't pick up her fork . <p> " Kids , " Nana said , " let me tell you a story about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my potatoes and poured a little swimming pool of gravy in the middle . <p> " Danny , you 're a pig , " said Gretchen . <p> " Ever since he was a baby , he loved music . " I did n't listen too closely . It seemed I 'd heard this story a million times . Music was the thing that comforted Dad from the earliest age ; it was the passion of his life , just like it was for Mother . Music was even how they took care of Nana after our grandfather died : Mother brought over a different record from the Disc Den every day  --  Sinatra , Perry Como , Patsy Cline  --  and they all sat in the living room and listened and hummed and cried until finally , months later , they did n't need to cry so much anymore . <p> Gretchen picked up a pea and held it up to her eye while Nana said the same old family stories . She rolled it between her thumb and first finger . I never knew a vegetable could be so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fistful of them later . <p> " Anyway , how do I say this ? " Nana asked . " Sometimes things do n't always go the way you mean them to . " Gretchen put her pea down and laid her head on the table . <p> " Do you see what I 'm getting at ? " Gretchen stayed still , her head flat on her arms , and closed her eyes . I mounded carrots onto a spoon . <p> " Your folks needed to try this thing before they got too old , like your old Nana here . " <p> I sucked on a piece of tomato . It gushed sweet and ripe on my tongue . I did n't know why Nana was telling us all this . Mother and Dad had said the same thing to us the night before they left . They were following their dreams , they said . We 'd have dreams , too , one day , everybody does . We 'd all be together , real soon , just like before ( only famous , only rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They 're not coming back , right ? " she said . " And we 're not going out there before school starts . " <p> Nana wiped her lips carefully with a yellow napkin . She did n't need to , I noticed , because like Gretchen she had n't taken a bite . <p> " No , Gretch , you 're not . " <p> Gretchen dropped her head to the table . I placed my fork on my plate . The pork bones , picked clean , were piled on one side of the dish , and bits of shredded meat and hunks of tomato were mounded beside them . An odd ringing started in my ears , as if a train were approaching from a distance . All of a sudden my stomach lurched on me ; I must have eaten way too much . Nana held a cool cloth to my head and whispered words I could n't hear while I heaved up all she 'd fed me into the kitchen sink . <p> Later that night , as we lay in Dad 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark . <p> " I do n't get it . When are we gon na see them ? " The mattress creaked above me while Gretchen rolled over . <p> " How do I know ? " She sounded mad . <p> Dad 's room looked familiar and odd at the same time . For more than sixty-four nights I 'd looked at the shadowy rectangle looming above me . I knew just the arc the light would take when a car passed and its headlights swooped around the far wall . It had felt like a kind of home to me before , this room and this house , but now it seemed the strangest place I 'd ever been . <p> " Danny , " Gretchen said , when she heard me chuffing for breath below her . " Danny , Danny , Danny , Danny . " She snaked her hand over the side of her bunk and down to me . I held her fingers with both hands . Before I fell asleep , Gretchen raised her arm up through the dark and did n't even say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smeared on her . <p> I heard the howls first . Next , the crack of Nana 's doorknob against the wall and her feet thudding down the stairs . <p> By the time I reached the kitchen , Nana was flinging water on the table . Her wall calendar lay on the floor over a heap of ashes , its edges charred all around . A candle and a box of matches had rolled under the kitchen table . Gretchen had been trying to burn the calendar when she 'd lit up Nana 's mail  --  all those letters from Mother and Dad , too . Orange flames shot up from the papers . <p> " Gretchen , " Nana said , louder than I 'd ever heard her speak . " Hell , what a mess . " She threw another potful of water and doused most of the fire . Some postcards skidded off the table and continued to flare on the floor . <p> " Do n't you tell me anything , Nana , " Gretchen yelled , " do n't you even try to tell me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just stop now . " <p> But Gretchen was n't done . She grabbed Nana 's sewing shears from a kitchen drawer  --  the ones with the zigzagged edges  --  and began cutting up what remained of the calendar . She sat against the kitchen door , across the room from Nana , snapping the scissors shut fiercely . The charred paper fell to dust with every snip . <p> Nana bent over the sink and rested her head in her hands . Her shoulders looked curved as a question mark . It struck me then that our Nana was an old person . " What will your parents say ? " she said to the window over the sink . <p> Gretchen pulled a big hunk of hair away from her head and shut the scissors down fast . I hopped by her side from one foot to the other . Nana whirled and raced to us , but most of Gretchen 's hair was gone by the time Nana reached her and wrestled the scissors out of her hands . <p> Nana laid the scissors on top of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She pulled her into her lap as if Gretchen were n't a twelve-year-old girl , but a baby , and rocked on her knees . Every now and then Nana lifted a hand to rub my calf . It was n't hard to reach me ; I 'd plastered myself against her side . <p> After , Nana sat us at the table and boiled up hot chocolate , even though it was summertime . We blew into our cups while she mopped the floor and swept up the long skeins of Gretchen 's hair . Gretchen looked ragged and strange . She 'd missed a spot , and a long panel of hair fell behind her . The hair on the sides of her head was all torn up and jutting wildly over her ears . There was a blankness to her eyes , a flat look I 'd never seen before , not even when she was trying to kill me . <p> " Hey , Gretch , " I whispered . I leaned over the table and tapped on the tops of the fingernails of her left hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a habit of Mother 's , something she 'd do absentmindedly while she was talking to one of us . Gretchen did n't say anything , but eventually she stretched her hand out to mine and began doing the same to the hand I was n't using : she lightly touched each nail . We sat like that while our cups of chocolate cooled between our outstretched arms . We touched , we lightly tapped , as persistently as if we were drumming out Morse code messages to each other . <p> Finally , Gretchen said , " Just do n't tell them , okay , Nana ? " <p> Nana was by the sink , ringing out the mop . For a minute she did n't answer , but stood looking out to her yard and garden behind the house . Without turning , she said , " All right , Gretchen . " <p> The next day , Nana dropped me with Timmy Walston and his mother at the municipal pool . She took Gretchen to the fanciest hairdresser in town , and when they picked me up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ layers . She looked years older than she was . <p> Nana kept her promise and never told Mother and Dad about what happened . Not in the next phone call , when she reported how we 'd started school in her district , or in the ones that followed through the fall . Nana did n't even tell the story that winter , when Mother and Dad finally did return . They 'd called in December and said to get ready : they were coming home . Their weekly gig had never turned into anything bigger . " Besides , " Mother said , " this is getting crazy . We go to sleep every night holding on to pictures of you guys  --  we want the real thing ! " <p> They arrived a few days before Christmas , the roof up , the car packed with all they 'd taken plus presents for us . When they came through the back door and saw Gretchen and me , Dad dropped to a crouch and held out his arms , and Mother covered her cheeks with her hands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the steps in the corner of Nana 's kitchen , pulled Gretchen and me onto her lap , and sniffed the backs of our necks . Dad stood and held onto Nana . <p> " I ca n't breathe , " she finally said , and Dad laughed and released her . Nana brought her hand to his cheek , and Dad gave a small laugh and shrugged . <p> " We tried , " he said . <p> Nana nodded . <p> " What do I smell ? " Dad cried , and we all crowded around the kitchen table , while Nana sliced a lamb roast and filled our plates with food . She had lighted candles and laid down a pale green tablecloth to make dinner a formal celebration . Mother and Dad kept reaching across the table to touch Gretchen and me while they told us stories about California . They touched our hands , our cheeks , our shoulders and wrists . Dad turned on the radio and fingered the air along with Hendrix . When we were finished eating , Mother rose with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  first mine , and then Gretchen 's . " You look so different , sweetie , " Mother said . " But I like it short . " <p> Gretchen and I eyed each other sideways . <p> " Yes , " Nana said , brushing the tablecloth clean , " she looks right this way , does n't she ? " She placed dessert bowls in front of us , empty and gleaming in the candlelight . <p> " She does , " said Dad , " but I still miss those braids . Are your friends cutting their hair short ? " <p> When Gretchen squeezed my knee under the table , I did n't know if it was a warning or a plea . It did n't matter , though . All I did was say what happened . " No , " I said to Dad and Mother . " It was her own idea . " <p> <p> By Hilary Rao <p>
