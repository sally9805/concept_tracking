HAD HE BEEN MERELY A PARTNER in one of figure skating 's greatest pairs , the news would have been devastating enough . Had he been simply a young father with an adoring wife , a precious three-year-old daughter and so much to live for , his death would have seemed unfathomable . But because Sergei Grinkov was Prince Charming on and off the ice , his fatal heart attack at the age of 28 last week is agonizingly tragic , not just for the millions who have watched him and his wife Ekaterina Gordeeva perform but especially for the close-knit skating community that had come to believe in the fairy tale of G and G. " We do n't need to have this lesson , " 1992 Olympic silver medalist Paul Wylie said as the snow fell outside Lake Placid 's Mirror Lake Inn two days after his friend 's death . " This is just too hard to accept . " <P> Wylie was one of the first skaters to reach Grinkov 's side after he collapsed during a Nov. 20 morning practice at the Lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Grinkov and Gordeeva had been rehearsing a program set to the music of Edvard Grieg 's Concerto in A Minor . ( Coincidentally , Grieg 's wife Nina , a singer , was his professional partner . ) After the routine , Sergei told Katia he was dizzy and slumped to the ice . For the first time since they began skating together in 1982 , it was Gordeeva who softened Grinkov 's fall . <P> As their coach , Marina Zueva , and two emergency medical technicians tried to resuscitate Grinkov , Wylie raced over . " I touched his skate to say a prayer for him , " said Wylie . " But his leg was limp . " Within four minutes an ambulance arrived to take Grinkov to the Adirondack Medical Center . For nearly an hour , Dr. Joshua Schwartzberg and the hospital staff worked to revive him , but Grinkov never responded , and he was pronounced dead at 12:28 p.m . When Schwartzberg gave Gordeeva the news , she sobbed on the floor , with Zueva at her side . She then asked if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room , " said Schwartzberg . " She spoke a few words to him in Russian . It seemed very tender . She caressed his face . She kissed him . I left her alone with him . " <P> An autopsy revealed that Grinkov 's death was caused by severe blockages of two coronary arteries , one of which is known as " the widowmaker . " His father had died suddenly four years ago at age 52 , and Grinkov had high blood pressure , as well as an enlarged heart . The autopsy also revealed that the skater had suffered a heart attack in the 24 hours before his death , but given his stoic nature and his high threshold of pain  --  he often skated with shoulder and back miseries  --  Grinkov might have brushed off the attack as mere discomfort . Indeed , the essence of his genius on the ice was that he sublimated his own presence to highlight the beauty of Gordeeva . " He was totally devoted to her , " said JoJo Starbuck , a former U.S. pairs champion who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at him with this I'm-so-in-love-with-you look that would just make your heart sing .
