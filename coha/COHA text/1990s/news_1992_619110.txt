<p> The Winter Olympics gold rush wo n't begin until next month , but many of biggest names in marketing are already racing to cash in on the world 's biggest sporting event . <p> McDonald 's , Procter &; Gamble , AT &T,; Chrysler and dozens of other advertising heavyweights have anted up millions of dollars in sponsorship fees , product endorsements and services in exchange for the right to link themselves with the 1992 Games . And not one of these companies has any intention of letting consumers forget that association . <p> As one of only a dozen worldwide sponsors , Visa International has paid an estimated $ 22 million to be the " official credit card " of the Olympics  --  that is , the only card accepted at the Olympic venues in Albertville , France . Since July , the San Mateo-based credit card company has been able to boast that " the Olympics do n't take American Express . " <p> On top of its worldwide sponsorship , Visa supports the U.S. basketball team and U.S. ski team . It is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members will sport Visa 's name on their unforms during pre-Olympic competitions . <p> " The Olympic association links us with winning and winners and things that are of top quality . It links us with the idea of the best in the world coming together to compete , " said John Bennett , Visa 's senior vice president responsible for event marketing . " All of that helps create a positive image for the company and its products . " <p> Other companies seem to agree . Despite the recession , U.S. sponsorship soared to $ 103 million , up 78 percent from the $ 58 million raised four years ago . And that 's despite the fact the U.S. Olympic Committee reduced the number of sponsoring companies for the 1992 Games to 46 from 58 in 1988 . The USOC derives about 35 percent of its four-year budget of $ 297 million from sponsorships and another 28 percent from television rights fees . <p> " The Olympics capture the imagination of everyone , " said John Krimsky , deputy secretary-general of the USOC and the group 's chief marketer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universal appeal paid an estimated $ 500,000 to $ 5 million each for U.S. Olympic team sponsorship , which includes the right to dub themselves the " official " drinking water ( Evian ) or mouthwash ( Scope ) or coffee ( Maxwell House ) of the U.S. team . Fees vary according to company size and industry . <p> CASH AND PRODUCTS <p> In some cases , companies exchanged a combination of cash and product for a sponsorship  --  78 percent of the food at Olympic training centers is provided by Olympic sponsors . Kraft , maker of Miracle Whip sandwich spread and Velveeta processed-cheese products , is able to say it " sets the Olympic training table " because it feeds U.S. team members at training centers in Colorado Springs , Colo. , and Lake Placid , N.Y . <p> The sponsorship , said Charlie Martin , Kraft 's vice president of marketing services , portrays the company 's products as " good enough so that America 's very best athletes would eat them as part of their training . " <p> International sponsors include Coca-Cola , 3M and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worldwide sponsors , but the company 's Kal Kan pet food is only a U.S. sponsor ) . They pay between $ 10 million and an estimated $ 35 million to use the famed five-ring symbol and its Olympic associations as part of their marketing strategies anywhere in the world . <p> Companies wishing to back a single U.S. team , such as skating or basketball , pay between $ 50,000 and $ 1 million , with those at the upper end authorized to put their logo on team uniforms . During pre-Olympic competitions , the U.S. and Swiss ski teams were moving billboards for Eastman Kodak , while the U.S. decathalon team put Visa first . <p> But the games wo n't look like the Indianapolis 500 , where drivers and their equipment are all but obliterated by decals . During the official events , logos are taboo and athletes ' uniforms carry only the country designation . <p> To make the most of a costly Olympic investment , " you ca n't pony up the fee for a sponsorship . You have to develop strong advertising , use the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Dick Bartlett , vice president of communications for Kodak 's imaging group . <p> FILM BOXES <p> Besides its support of the ski team , Kodak paid an estimated $ 21 million to be a worldwide Olympic sponsor . As such , the company imprinted the Olympic rings on billions of film boxes and millions of cameras all over the world . Kodak expects to provide more than 200,000 rolls of film to photographers covering the Games , as well as photo processing and photo transmission facilities . <p> The company also will be a major presence during the TV broadcast of the winter and summer Games , expected to be seen by a total of 4.5 billion people . During the winter broadcast on CBS and the Turner cable network , Kodak will air 40 commercials for its film worldwide  --  an additional investment of several million dollars . <p> Even the U.S. Postal Service got caught up in the Olympic marketing frenzy . Although the government agency is not considered to be a worldwide marketer , it bought an international sponsorship for $ 10 million  --  then recouped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in other countries . <p> " We are a business and we compete , but often we find that people do n't think of us in that way , " said Deborah Bowker , assistant postmaster general . Joining such companies as Bausch &; Lomb and Kellogg 's , said Bowker , " signals that we are competing in a business-like way . " <p> DYNAMIC MAIL SERVICE <p> Ads portray the Postal Service as efficient and dynamic . One TV spot shows a close-up of a man who appears to be an athlete dressing in heavy winter gear , pulling on boots and buckling a thick belt . As the camera pulls away , viewers see that the " athlete " is a postmaster in Alaska preparing for his rounds . " In this Olympic year , we share with you the quest to be the best , " the ad says . In another spot , a relative of an Olympic skater uses the Postal Service 's Express Mail to quickly send the athlete a training tape . <p> But a better image is n't all the Postal Service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a profit center , " said Bowker , noting that the agency has already earned a profit of $ 22 million from its Olympic Pen Pal Club and sales of Olympic stamps , envelopes with Olympic stamps and athletes ' signatures and other paraphernalia .  --  <p> OLYMPIC ADVERTISING AT A GLANCE <p> . <p> WINTER OLYPMICS / Feb. 8-23 , 1992 , Albertville , France <p> SUMMER OLYMPICS / July 25-Aug. 9 , 1992 , Barcelona , Spain <p> . <p> U.S. SPONSORS <p> The fee is between $ 500,000 and $ 5 million to use the Olympic rings and U.S. team symbol and mention the association in U.S. advertising , packaging and promotions . <p> * AT &T; ( telecommunications ) <p> * AMR Combs ( corporate air services ) <p> * Anheuser-Busch ( beer ) <p> * ARA Group ( food consultants for stadiums ) <p> * Baxter Healthcare Corp .
