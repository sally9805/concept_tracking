" Matisse in Morocco , " which opened Sunday at New York City 's Museum of Modern Art ( it was at the National Gallery in Washington through the spring , and will go to Moscow and Leningrad in the fall and winter ) , is what used to be called a connoisseurs ' show . It covers a short time in a long life . Henri Matisse visited Morocco just twice , in early 1912 and again in the winter of 1912-13 . Hence the exhibition is fairly small , only 24 paintings and a large group of sketchbook drawings . It can be seen without sore feet and framed as a whole in one 's mind . It is thorough , scholarly  --  Jack Cowart , John Elderfield , Pierre Schneider and others have done a fine job on the catalog  --  and , above all , full of exhilaratingly beautiful paintings that have lost none of their sensuous finesse and cerebral sharpness in the nearly 80 years since Matisse made them . <P> As a bonus , some of the paintings are being seen in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best work that Morocco evoked from Matisse was bought by those two pioneer collectors Sergei Shchukin and Ivan Morosov and has remained in Leningrad 's Hermitage and Moscow 's Pushkin museums since the Russian revolution . As no reproduction has ever done justice to the peculiar intensity of the thin , washed , yet highly saturated color Matisse developed in Morocco , one is grateful that the components of this phase of his work have at last been reunited . Matisse was a mature painter of 42 when he went to Morocco , but what he learned from the trip struck to the very root of his development as an artist . He was tempted to make a third trip but never did . <P> Why should he have gone to North Africa , a part of the world that Frenchmen in 1912 were still apt to generalize as " the Orient " ? There were two basic reasons : cultural curiosity and the search for light . <P> Matisse wanted a place where the sun shone reliably , like a lamp , where the conditions of light , constant from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into color without distraction . Later he would find this stability by moving permanently to Nice , but it was not available in Paris .

In North Africa it produced radiant motifs : the green garden , the white breastlike curves of marabout domes , the angled cuts of shadow in street and alley , the blue haze of light behind ogival arches . <P> But Matisse 's pictorial motives differed from those of all European artists who had visited " the Orient " before . French painters from the 1830s on , starting with Eugene Delacroix , had gone there in search of the picturesque , the exotic , the ready-made subject : mosques and Riffian horsemen , camels and harem slaves . By 1880 Orientalism had become a large fashion among salon painters and their clients .
