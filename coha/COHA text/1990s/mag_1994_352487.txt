BASKETBALL IS CALLED THE CITY game , but that 's not quite right . The really slick city game is played by college and high school coaches , sports agents , shoe manufacturers , sportswriters and TV producers . It involves conning kids  --  mostly poor black kids  --  into believing that they can grow up to play professional basketball . The fine documentary film Hoop Dreams shows how the game is played with high school basketballers in Chicago , and now Darcy Frey 's thoughtful , sharply observed book , The Last Shot ( Houghton Mifflin ; 230 pages ; $19.95 ) , spells out its consequences for students at Abraham Lincoln High School in the bleak Coney Island section of Brooklyn . <P> Lincoln High 's Railsplitters  --  Abe 's rustic nickname is grotesque in this concrete waste  --  are city champs coming into the 1991 season . Their best players are returning as seniors : Russell , a guard who emerges , coldly intent , to take over games ; Tchaka , a wonderfully athletic 6-ft. 7-in. power forward ; and Corey , only 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Coming up as a freshman is a supernatural shooter named Stephon . With this sort of talent , the question is n't whether Lincoln will dominate its league again ; the question is whether the three seniors , and Stephon when he 's older , will win basketball scholarships to Division 1 colleges , the schools that incubate most of the N.B.A. pros . <P> Frey gets to know Coney Island not as a place with a few old amusement park rides but as 50 square blocks of high-rises housing poor families and fractions of families . The athletes are the hope of the community , and they are talented enough to play at any college . Everyone knows this , including the big-time coaches who buddy up , winking and promising . For the honor of the neighborhood , Frey makes us feel , to redeem something from the miles of drabness , at least one of these guys must make it big . But the odds are n't good . The omens that say so are n't so much the ubiquitous drug dealers but rather the old Lincoln @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gifted fellows who never got near the Celts or Lakers . <P> The players ' biggest problem is that Division 1 colleges make at least a pretense of being educational institutions . They require sat scores of 700 for entrance . This is n't high if you 've been prepped for these tests for years , but in educational terms the kids at Lincoln were written off before first grade . Some members of the team try to study enough to make up the difference . Mostly they are n't successful , so they are sidetracked to junior colleges , not hopelessly off the N.B.A. track , but slowly lose confidence and direction . Like the Lincoln High legends before them , they will someday be back home on the sidelines watching a new crop of kids who can make a basketball do card tricks .
