MISS EULALIA POTTS , librarian , was fond of dimming the lights four times  --  three short dims and then a long , like the opening bars of Beethoven 's Fifth . Fate knocking at the door , whatever . She wished to forewarn the heavy readers with a touch of tasteful severity that in twenty minutes she would cast them out . They would surface briefly , eyes drugged with words , and plunge back in like earthworms trying to avoid the light , but a comer of the mind had been dismayed , could make a decision to check things out , even recall where the card was kept . It was a smallish sort of town , but for thirty years Miss Potts had run as tight a ship as any urban librarian . <p> Just to the right of the checkout desk was a banner , framed , of needlepoint that proclaimed with a floral embellishment : " There is no frigate like a book . " And to the left , a similar one that made its statement without adornment : " Silence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She openly despised the needle . One sewed to escape from reading . But high above Miss Potts 's head hung an unframed plea of modest size that she indeed had made herself : " When turning pages , please refrain from moistening the thumb . " Children of course were in awe of Miss Potts and never outgrew it and passed the awe on to children of theirs . She liked the children . She secretly despised the heavy readers . They read to avoid the challenge of life . They were failures . <p> When Caleb Dawkins came in just after she had dimmed the lights , she hoped he would not wander vaguely but state his business in a forthright way . He was neither a child nor a heavy reader . She found that she could recall his name , though he almost never trod her turf . He would be high school , she supposed , but of course his sweater was emblazoned with it , Class of ' 37 . <p> He shuffled to her reluctantly . " Miss Potts , you got some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> " On what subject ? " <p> " Any subject . American History . I ca n't think of none . " <p> " Are you given a list of possible subjects ? " He shook his head in youthful mourning . " What period of American History ? " <p> " She do n't care . " <p> " She could n't possibly have turned you loose on the entire sweep of American History . " <p> He looked away into the stacks . " She do n't care . " <p> " Does n't care . " She sighed . " Could n't you have come in earlier ? " But looking down at his grubby hands and weary eyes she saw that he must have been involved with something strenuously athletic . She studied him with speculation . And then she asked , " Are you strong and healthy ? " <p> The question caused him some surprise . <p> " But of course you are if you 're on the team . Unless the sweater belongs to your brother . " <p> " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the team . " He waited a moment . " About the paper , Miss Gibson says I have to have ten references . Three of them got to be magazines . " <p> Miss Potts whooped . " Lila Gibson ! I remember her with sticky hands . All over the books . They smelled of gum . She used a Tootsie Roll for a bookmark . " <p> " Miss Gibson did ? Wow ! " he said . <p> " Blackmail her into a passing grade . " <p> He did not quite know how to proceed . With most adults you could get some kind of a vague idea where the conversation was going to lead . Miss Potts was really different , though . <p> She looked at the clock above the desk . " It 's closing time ... I might have something in mind for you . Come back tomorrow afternoon . " <p> He shifted his feet . " Ma'am , I got practice after school . " <p> " Well , that does n't last all afternoon . Get a shower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Yes , ma'am , " he said . <p> As he turned to leave she pinioned him with a hushed , throaty call , lots of wind but not much voice : " Caleb , do you know how to drive a car ? " <p> And now , of course , he was really amazed . " I can drive my uncle 's truck , " he said . <p> She smiled and dimmed the lights again . She was girding her loins to throw them out , the man with his head in the Sunday Times and the girl who slept with her face on a book . <p> He was back the following afternoon . He had pondered the wisdom of not showing up , but he had to pass history to play on the team . <p> " Why are you limping ? " she asked him sternly . <p> " I turned my foot at practice . " <p> " Is it serious , then ? " <p> " No , ma'am , " he said . <p> " You 'll need both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nothing she said to him made any sense . She led him back behind the desk and past the stacks of yellowing weeklies and under the stairs and into her lair . She had maps and pictures all over the walls , photographs that were brown with age , nothing that had any color to it , except for one , and that he knew from Miss Clifford 's class : The Birth o Venus . He had missed who painted it on the test . <p> Miss Potts saw him looking at the tits of Venus . She all but snapped her fingers at him . " Sit down , " she said . " Sit down , sit down . We do n't have a lot of time to waste . Soak that foot in Epsom salts as soon as you get home tonight . " <p> " Yes , ma'am , " he said , and then he sat . <p> She sat as well , behind her desk . " American History you say it is ? Well , Caleb , I have the thing for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite in earnest . And steadfast too . Loyal to things you undertake . " <p> He felt that she knew the Boy Scout oath , knew it by heart , might even ask him to say it to her . His foot was throbbing . " Yes , ma'am , " he said . <p> She crossed her arms on the orange blotter and leaned to him .... " Above all , Caleb , a sense of daring . And a thirst for knowledge . Do you have it , Caleb ? " <p> He stirred uneasily . " I reckon , ma'am . " <p> She fixed him with a wintry eye . " What kind of answer is that ? " she said . " Do you or do n't you have a thirst ? " <p> " Yes , ma'am , I do . " He thought of sitting at Richardson 's Drugs , having a Coke with the rest of the team . <p> She took a long deep breath at that . Her eyes just brushed Venus rising out of the sea . She opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pencils into a pile and pushed them to the edge of the blotter . She rested upon him her sad , firm gaze . " Are . you acquainted with the facts of life ? " <p> He felt his face grow slightly warm . " Ma'am ? What facts ? " <p> She folded her hands . " People who quibble always are .... Well , that 's settled . I had to know . My function is not ... I can not in conscience destroy an innocence .... Now , " she began in a businesslike tone , " I want you to look at two photographs . They 're on the wall . No , you 'll have to get up . Do you see those two men under the map ? The pictures are made from daguerreotypes . " <p> Caleb got up and limped to the wall . One he was sure of . All that beard , it had to be . " I reckon it 's Lincoln . " <p> " Who is the other , would you say ? " <p> He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> He stared at the men . " I reckon they do . Some , I guess . " <p> " Some ? " <p> " Well , a lot , I guess . " <p> " And can you guess why that is ? " she asked . <p> " Maybe because they 're kinfolks , ma'am ? " <p> " You have made a brilliant deduction , Caleb . You have taken the first exciting step . Research begins with such a step . All research . All research ... Are you wondering about the other man ? " <p> He could tell from her tone that he had to wonder . " Yes , ma'am , " he said . <p> She left him to wonder a little while . " Jefferson Davis , " she said at last . " Two mighty leaders locked in combat . Two presidents . . . two brothers , mortal enemies . " <p> He continued to stand and stare at the face . He did n't know what else to do . One shoe was tight . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sit and undo the lace . <p> " You may well be stunned . As I was stunned . " <p> " Yes , ma'am , " he said . <p> " Sit down , Caleb . There is much to be done . " <p> He could tell that her voice had a different tone . It occurred to him it was like the coach addressing the team before a game . The words were different . The tone was the same . <p> " Caleb , I propose to equip you with a revelation that if rightly imparted will change the course of history . " She thought of this while she toyed with a pencil . " Let us say , instead , the interpretation of history . Or , rather , we should say the writing of history .... Do you understand me , Caleb ? " <p> " No , ma'am , " he said . <p> " Well , presently you will . We shall start at the beginning . In the paper you will write for Miss Lila Gibson of the sticky fingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spun her desk chair till the back of her head and a knob of gray hair were all he could see . Her hairpins stuck out like a porcupine 's quills . Her finger skated along a row of green books behind her desk and extracted one . She half-whirled back and opened it . He saw that she had a hairpin inside it to mark the place . <p> She spun herself back to him all the way . " I shall read from the Encyclopaedia Britannica . There is no higher authority . Remember that , Caleb . And when you spell it for Lila Gibson , please spell it with an ae ' instead of an e . ' " She looked at him sternly . <p> " Yes , ma'am , " he said . <p> She stared at him with abstracted eyes . " On second thought , I 'm tempted to skip the beginning for now and plunge right in . Beginnings tend to be tedious . " She seemed to require his confirmation . <p> " Yes , ma'am , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Seventeen , " he said . Well , he would be in a couple of months . <p> She listened with barely courteous distaste . " That 's not very old , I 'm afraid , " she said . " However , " she added with rising cheer , " time is in our favor . " <p> " Yes , ma'am , " he said . <p> " Coming of age is a moment in time . " Her eyes skimmed Venus and dropped to the volume she held in her lap . Abruptly she snapped it shut on the hairpin . She opened her desk drawer and drew out a key with which she opened another drawer . From this second drawer she extracted a book , which she opened with the extremest care . Caleb saw it was ready to fall apart . It was more like a notebook than a book . It had small sheets of caramel-colored , square-cut paper dimly , closely written over with ink . <p> Miss Potts gently cleared her throat . " From time to time people favor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or moving away . Or people die , and after their relatives divide the spoils they give us anything that 's left . Like The Rover Boys . We 've thirteen sets . There 's a box in the basement that 's just come in . It will probably give us another set . I make it a policy to take it all . Some day they may give us something we want . Some gem they are totally unaware . . . " A reminiscence curled her lip . " And that is how we came to possess this original copy of a diary written by a Mrs. Mary Gilpin , who wrote about her daily life in 1809 in rural Kentucky . <p> " Her spelling is poor . " She glanced at him , as if somehow she had heard of his . <p> " Yes , ma'am , " he said . <p> " I shall read from an entry dated February seventeenth of that year : This weak Nancy Lincoln was delivred of a boy . My fealing is it is not Toms boy . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nancy tuk on work at The Flying Hawk ten months ago , a little more . She tuk her little girl along and lef her each day with the gardners wife who had too of her own . Sarah Hutton says Seth says their come a gentlemun from south of hear .

He was three nites their and Nancy went up to his chamber to clene and Seth says the rumor went that it tuk a blessed long time to clene . She worked on their for another 3 months and then she tuk sick and did nt go back and Ham Wesleys daughter tuk her place . " <p> She looked up at him . " Caleb , " she said , " are you following me ? " <p> " Not exactly , ma'am . " <p> She sighed and frowned . " What this is saying in the plainest English , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to believe that a man named Davis fathered Abraham Lincoln . If this man in question was Samuel Davis , he was headed home to be with his wife before she delivered on June the third his tenth and last child , named Jefferson . And he stopped at the inn where Nancy , the mother of Lincoln , worked . Except that she was n't the mother of Lincoln , but she would be in another nine months . I have utterly no use for such a man ! I wish to put it in the strongest terms . <p> " Caleb looked at sea . <p> Miss Potts rolled her eyes and turned them away . " History is full of these peccadilloes . I would n't besmirch your ears with it , except that imbedded in this miserable oyster is the rarest of pearls . I refer to the cause of the Civil War . " <p> " Ma'am , Miss Gibson said we should n't get into causes or nothin ' .... " <p> " Bother Miss Gibson ! A girl who would mark her place with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just have to get around Miss Gibson , throw her a Tootsie Roll to gnaw . Our goal is grand prize in the statewide history competition . . . and after that , Caleb , your future is made . She must not be allowed to blight your future . " <p> " Ma'am , this paper was just for Miss Gibson .... " <p> " We must set our goal higher than Lila Gibson . I have the address . " <p> He decided that she was just as batty as any bedbug could possibly be , but most adults seemed to be slightly off . And he recalled that he had to pass history or else he could n't play on the team . <p> She smiled in a way that slapped a claim on him  --  like maybe she was kin or something like that  --  and shoved her hairpins into her knob . Her bright eyes took in the photographs , climbed to Venus , then veered and plummeted to the map . " Caleb , " she said , " you do understand that a diary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Britannica ? By punch I mean authority . But facts observed , recorded , Caleb , by eye and ear ... observation of fact is the mother of history . So , Caleb , what I propose to you is a trip to the scene of the action . " <p> He had n't an idea what she meant . " A trip to where ? " he finally asked . <p> " To The Flying Hawk , wherever else ? " <p> " Ma'am , I missed that part about the bird . " <p> Her look was withering . " The Flying Hawk is the name of the inn where the fate of the South was conceived . " <p> " I thought you said it was Abraham Lincoln . " <p> " But Lincoln , Caleb , started the war . And all for envy . All for envy . Envy is one of the deadly sins . " <p> " Yes , ma'am , " he said . <p> " We 'll discuss envy along the way . Do you think you could get your uncle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Ma'am ? " he said . He was utterly amazed . <p> " I thought you told me you knew how to drive your uncle 's truck . " <p> " That do n't mean he 's gon na let me take it . " <p> " He will , " she said . " I 'll write him a note . I 'll mention Miss Gibson . " She smiled at him with a trace of glee . " I can always mention that atlas he borrowed and left in the rain . Before your day . Argentina was washed away . A total loss . " <p> Right on the spot she wrote . the note . " And Caleb , be sure to bring a shovel and pick . " <p> He could only stare . <p> " In case , " she said , " it comes to that . Well , it is n't a matter of digging for Troy . " <p> He was sure his uncle would save his skin . Tell him he could n't have the truck . For by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off down the road with old lady Potts and a shovel and pick , leave Tennessee and cross into Kentucky where he did n't belong and neither did she . Ordinarily he was eager to drive whenever his uncle would give him the chance . His uncle suspected him of racing the truck and put him off most of the times he asked . But to his amazement his uncle embraced the whole idea , thought that maybe his grade would improve enough that he could stay on the team . And he trusted Miss Potts to keep him from racing . But just in case she lost control , he had a governor put on the truck which would keep them from racing over thirty-five . <p> It was early May and the sky was fair with only a wisp of fog in the trees . Miss Potts had said to leave at seven . She was waiting for him in front of her house , which was covered with vines . Her whole front yard was covered with bricks , but grass and a lot of stuff leaked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had never seen her dressed up before . Clearly it was n't in her plan to use the pick or the shovel herself . Her black-and-white dress was printed with sprays of ... it looked like oats . A black felt hat was pushed over her brow to make a space for her knot at the back . She carried a purse that was speckled with beads and a lemon-colored hamper of straw , which she said contained their picnic lunch , and two umbrellas , one for each of them . He hoped nobody would see them leave . <p> Once inside , she took off her hat . " This is going to be . an adventure , Caleb . I feel it all the way down to my toes . Mind and body and spirit , Caleb . Each in turn and all at once . " <p> " Yes , ma'am , " he said . <p> " May is the finest month for travel . " She had maps with the lunch in her big straw hamper , and she got them out and spread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see to shift the gears . In a voice of elation she ordered , " Head north . You notice , " she said , " I 'm not whispering . I 'm obliged to whisper all week long . Ca n't you go a little faster ? " she asked . <p> " No , ma'am , I ca n't . My uncle has done put a governor on it . " <p> " Ca n't you take it off ? " <p> " No , ma'am , he 'd skin me alive if I did . " <p> " Well , he wo n't skin me . Nobody skins a librarian . Pull over to the side . Do you have some tools ? " <p> He could n't believe it . She selected a screwdriver , pliers , and wrench and went in under the hood like a pro . He was in a sweat that somebody who knew him would come along . He slumped in the seat . When she climbed back in , she confided with glee , " I never could stand something holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . He could n't say why , but he thought of Venus and her naked tits . <p> He was really relieved when they crossed the border . The chances were better that they would n't run into somebody he knew . The sun was bright . The air was soft and smelled of summer . The land was green . The pick and shovel made a rat-tat-tat in the bed of the truck . She invited him to join her in singing " My Old Kentucky Home , " but he could n't bring himself to that . He listened to her while she belted it out like the coach on the day before a game . " I enjoy not having to whisper , " she said . " I let it all out the entire weekend . " the governor off , they made good time . He did n't know what they were looking for , unless it could be that hawk location . <p> " You find that place on the map you got , ma'am ? " <p> She laughed aloud . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a century and a quarter ago . I do n't expect to find it there . There might be a stone or two left on the spot . We might have to shovel a little dirt . If it 's still standing it will be something else . We might have to jimmy a lock or two . We shall certainly do some detective work . Are you familiar with Sherlock Holmes ? " <p> " No , ma'am , " he said . " Is he somebody we 're lookin ' for ? " <p> She gave a snort . " You do n't appear to be much of a reader . " <p> " No , ma'am , " he said . <p> " A pity , " she said . " When you come to writing this essay of yours , all you 've read will be food for it . " <p> " Yes , ma'am , " he said . With the mention of food he was suddenly hungry . He eyed the hamper she kept on the floor between her feet . There was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to time she spread her map over the gears . <p> In a couple of hours she announced they were there . <p> He honestly did n't know where that was . She made him pull off the road a ways and showed him the tiny dot on the map . " That 's where the Lincolns were married , Caleb , and where they were living when little Abraham was conceived . And here we 're only a few miles away . Thomas was a drifter , by all accounts , and a poor provider . So Nancy got some work at the inn and walked to it carrying her little girl . It must be somewhere close to here . And what we have to do , of course , is comb this region to find some traces of the inn . A building stone or two will do . Some piles of weathered bricks . In winter each guest would have had a fire . A structure on the verge of collapse would be a promising sign , ! think . " <p> He could n't believe they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this was all she knew to say . He looked at the countryside dotted with trees and a few lone houses here and there . " Ma'am , you think we should ask in town ? " <p> " You think I have n't thought of that ? I have already written the Chamber of Commerce . As a matter of fact , some time ago . They claim no knowledge of The Flying Hawk Inn . And it does n't surprise me in the least . Not in the least . Not in the least . " <p> He could n't think why it did n't surprise her . It surprised him a lot . And then it did n't surprise him a bit . <p> " Caleb . " She patted him on the arm . " I think you 'll find me a homing pigeon . I have an instinct for finding things which is strongly developed by my profession . It 's taken me years , but I say it now with all modesty : I am able to locate any book misshelved by a careless or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost book . " <p> " Yes , ma'am , " he said , " but I 'm too hungry to drive any more . " <p> " It 's early , " she said , " but I honor the need . Pull under that tree . " <p> While he stuffed his mouth with chunks of fried chicken and hardboiled eggs and washed them down with warm lemonade , she sat in the weeds and read to him out of the Britannica , a volume of which had emerged from the hamper along with lunch . Below the hem of her dress imprinted with all the oats  --  across the road he could see a field of them barely up-her pink slip boldly proclaimed itself . She seemed to regard him as some sort of kin she would n't mind seeing her underwear . He looked away from it into the trees . He wished to be anywhere else in the world . <p> Between tiny bites of her egg salad sandwich she explained to him that Nancy Hanks was a natural child . " That means her father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use for such a man ! " She looked at him with severity , as if she suspected he harbored the seeds . With a little shock , he saw her reach into the neck of her dress and toss the oats and pull some glasses out of her breast , or whatever was in there behind the oats . She settled the glasses on her nose and read : " ' Nothing is known of the father of Nancy Hanks , though there is a persistent rumor that he was a Virginia aristocrat . ' Note that , Caleb . I find it of grave significance . " She resumed her reading . " Nancy 's famous son appears to have believed the story and to have felt that whatever distinction he possessed had come from this unacknowledged heritage of aristocracy . ' Note that , Caleb . This champion , as we see him , of the common man , and all the time he yearns for the gentry who rejected his mother . " <p> She dragged another book from the hamper and found the hairpin that marked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . Your paper must give him a footnote or two .... According to Sandburg , her mother would croon in the evening to Nancy , ' Hush thee , hush thee , thy father 's a gentleman . ' Note , Caleb , that at the earliest age there is planted in Nancy a knowledge that the life which is rightfully hers she has been denied from the moment of birth . Life on a Virginia plantation , Caleb , faithful darkies to do her bidding , splendid balls , dazzling gowns , high , born admirers . As she grew older , imagine , Caleb , the rebellion stirring in her breast . " <p> He thought of Venus . <p> She noted that his attention strayed . " You are asking , Caleb , how Sandburg knew what the mother would croon . I can only say that a man of research will come to a knowledge of fact through his pores , perhaps as I come to the misshelved book . Which is not to say that you and I will rely on our pores . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She snaked her glasses down through the oats and into her chest . She gathered things up and into her hamper . She got to her feet with a richer display of her slip than ever . " Well , onward and upward ! The grass will be growing under our feet . " <p> He struggled up . His foot was asleep . " Which way , ma'am ? " <p> She pointed gaily down the road . " Drive till I tell you to stop , " she said . <p> The only thing left to do was drive .... The grownups had really enslaved the young , but Lincoln had never bothered with that . You did n't get power until you were old and then you forgot what kids went through . He blamed his uncle for most of this . He always said no when you needed yes . When you needed no , he could n't wait to come up with yes .... They were whipping along at a fast little clip over bad dirt roads . The truck was bouncing and rattling its fenders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the rear . The dust was flying when all of a sudden Miss . Potts cried , " Stop ! " <p> They were passing a little house back from the road . She ordered him firmly to hop a ditch and drive up close . When he did , the hounds came from under a bush and jumped all over the side of the truck . <p> Miss Potts 's lips were set in a smile , as if she enjoyed a good barking at . After about five minutes of this , a woman came around the side of the house and told the dogs they had better shut up . Miss Potts leaned out and called to her sweetly in a voice pitched up from her library voice and down a peg from " Old Kentucky Home . " " You look as if you know this region quite well . Would you happen to know the whereabouts of an old , old inn called The Flying Hawk ? " <p> The woman pushed the hair up out of her face and held it there like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Think hard , my dear , " said Miss Potts with patience . " I 'm very anxious to find that inn or even the place where it used to be . An inn is something like a small hotel . I 'm very sure it was close to here . " <p> The dogs whined in a lonesome way . The woman came to some sort of life . She dropped her hair and pointed her finger . " You go on down to the next house down . Yella house sits back from the road . Real old man , he sits in the yard . He might could tell you . He 's ninety-eight . " <p> " Thank you , my dear . I 'm indebted to you . " And Caleb saw Miss Potts blow her a kiss .... He felt that things were coming unglued , and would only get worse . He was sure of it . <p> Sure enough , the old man was out in the yard . His chair was under a sweet gum tree . A breeze was ruffling his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " I told you , Caleb , ! have an instinct . There sits the book that has been misshelved . The scholars have all of them passed him by , because when they happened to come along he was sitting here and not on the shelf . I venture to say that before we 're done we shall bring the Britannica to its knees . " <p> Miss Potts was aware of the proper course . She marched to the door of the yellow house with its crumbling brick pillars and its dogs sleeping under the sagging porch and its sociable speckled hens in a huddle . She knocked while Caleb sat in the cab . With reluctant eyes , he watched her conversing at length with the screen . She turned around and waved him out . " Permission is granted , " she cheerily called . And when he approached , " Anyone that 's as old as this , you have to check with the owner first . " <p> " Somebody owns him ? " Caleb asked . <p> " Of course , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She owns him ? " Caleb could n't let it go . " Ma'am , Miss Gibson says it 's how come they fought the Civil War . " <p> " Lila Gibson knows nothing at all . Your paper will tell her why it was fought . " <p> All the time the old man was sitting nearby as if he was n't aware of them . <p> " His granddaughter says . he is very deaf . You may have to lend me your voice for this . " <p> Caleb hoped it would n't come to that . He hoped that when he was ninety-eight . . . but happily Miss Potts would be dead by then , with Abraham Lincoln and all the rest . He stationed himself behind the tree , to blend with the branches as best he could . Miss Potts had sailed right up to the man and plopped herself into a chair at his side . She even knew his name , it seemed . <p> " Mr. Putney , " she yelled , " I 'm Eulalia Potts . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He turned his head very slowly to her . The breeze was tumbling and tossing his hair . <p> " The Flying Hawk . Have you heard of it ? " <p> He waved his hand slowly in front of his face , as if he was batting a fly away . <p> " The Flying Hawk . You remember it ? " <p> He spoke to the air in a quivering voice . " Flies is bad . " <p> " The Flying Hawk . " She had pitched her yell to a higher key . " Tell me about The Flying Hawk . " <p> Caleb could see there was n't much of him left and Miss Potts was going to wipe out that . There would n't be enough to scrape off the grass . He was in worse shape than the diary book that had started all this , but she did n't care how she handled him . Caleb tried to sneak off and get in the cab , but Miss Potts spied him and beckoned him over . " Repeat these words as loud as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ' " <p> He saw that the sooner he did what she said , the sooner they could get in the truck and leave . So he walked up close and yelled to the pink and hairy ear , " Do you remember The Flying Hawk ? " <p> " The Flyin ' Hawk ? A course I do . " <p> Caleb nearly fell over him . The man had a weak , breathy , trembly voice , as if he were riding a bumpy road and the motion had got him tuckered out . <p> Eulalia Potts had stars in her eyes . " Tell us what you recall , " she shrieked into his ear . <p> He looked at her , puzzled , and shook his head . <p> At that moment a woman with bouncy blonde hair and her arm in a sling came out of the house . With her one good arm she carried a tray with a pitcher of something and glasses for all . She laid it down on the grass at their feet . From the smell Caleb knew it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to have a peck at Miss Potts 's oats . The woman shooed it away with her foot . She drew from her apron some gold-rimmed glasses . They belonged to the man , for she slipped the earpieces . over his ears , one at a time because of her arm . Then she drew from her apron a large black object in the shape of a horn , which she handed with a tight little smile to Miss Potts . <p> " I guarantee this here is the best . " She spoke in a strained whisper . " My voice box is done gone down the drain . " <p> " Well , well , " said Miss Potts , caressing the trumpet , " you 're as welcome as spring . And Caleb , you help this good woman , you hear , with whatever she 's brought to refresh our day . I see that you 've injured your arm , my dear . " <p> " It takes it outa the bones , you know . You yell the stiffenin ' outa your bones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Miss Potts observed . <p> Caleb poured lemonade and passed it around . The old man spilled half of his down his front , but his granddaughter pulled a towel from her apron and mopped him off . <p> Miss Potts boomed her questions into the trumpet , which she held to his ear . " Is The Flying Hawk still standing today ? " <p> He shook his head . <p> " Do you know where it is ? " <p> He pointed due north , but his finger shook itself into northeast , then veered again to east-southeast . Caleb , sipping his drink , felt a great relief . Since he could n't be asked to circle the compass , he would probably not have to dig at all . But he could n't of course be sure of it . <p> Miss Potts was undaunted . " Tell me what you have heard of it . " <p> He Shuffled some lemonade up his nose and fell to sneezing . His teeth flew out , but his granddaughter clapped them back into place . He closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pond , " he said . " I reckon somebody fish me out . " <p> Miss Potts pursued him . " The Flying Hawk ! " <p> His eyes were still shut . " It 's kinda slippery . I 'm tryin ' to find a place I can hold . Got ta find a place to keep from slippin ' . " <p> " He do n't mean the pond , " his granddaughter said . " He 's afflicted with slippery recollection . " <p> " Indeed , " said Miss Potts , " it afflicts us all . " <p> " He 's got a mind in a delicate way . Jus ' leave ' im be for a little spell . " <p> But he opened his eyes and looked around . " Day I uz twelve year ol ' , see , my granpappy he live ... he live ... he live ... well , I fergit . " <p> He slapped at the trumpet , which tickled his ear . He lapsed into silence . <p> " Go on , " yelled Miss Potts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my lust hoss . It uz the lust hoss I ever shoed . Did n't do too good .... " He showed them his teeth in a silent laugh . " He uz tellin ' as how he used to shoe hosses fer The Flyin ' Hawk and how he done twelve hosses one day . He tol ' me ... tol ' me ... to1 ' me he shoed his lust un ' at twelve , jus ' like I done my lust at twelve . He tol ' me that . Day I uz twelve . " The old man seemed to be pleased with his tale . <p> Miss Potts raised the trumpet again to his ear . " Did he speak of the people who stayed at the inn ? Anyone at all ? " <p> He shook his head and slapped at the horn . <p> But she restored it . " Think hard , " she yelled . <p> " He do n't like to think , " his granddaughter said . " It makes him itch . " <p> " Nobody likes to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But as long as we 're alive we have to think . " <p> Two retrievers and three speckled hens had raised their heads . The old man scratched and shoo.k his own . <p> " Mr. Putney , " bellowed Miss Potts again , " do you . . . are you a God-fearing man ? " <p> He swayed a little . His granddaughter said with modest pride , " He knows about ever ' hymn there is . " <p> " The good Lord put you here to think . " <p> He scratched his chest . <p> " That means he 's thinkin ' , " the woman said . <p> " Caleb , " said Miss Potts in the grimmest of tones . " I think this calls for extravagant measures . Bring me my hamper out of the truck . " <p> He did n't think he could take any more , for he guessed that her plan was to holler Britannica stuff aloud . He thought it would finish the old man off . Caleb had barely survived it himself , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped it with sorry grace at her feet . And then to his everlasting shock she pulled from its depths a bottle of whiskey . In a Nu-Grape bottle , but whiskey , all right . She lifted the old man 's lemonade glass that had slid to the ground and poured into it a portion of spirits . She turned to the woman . " This is wholesome spirits made of wholesome corn . I carry it for a medicinal need . With your permission ... " <p> The woman looked doubtful . " Well , he ai n't sick . Old ai n't sick . " <p> " Of course he 's sick . He refuses to think . Spirits will restore his brain to its function . " <p> The granddaughter frowned , but her hair could n't keep itself out of a bounce that signaled yes . " He 's liable to start singin ' all them hymns . " <p> " We 'll take the risk , " Miss Potts replied . She poured a drop of it into the trumpet and tipped the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little and smiled . He began to scratch . <p> Miss Potts leaned over and gave him a nice little pat on the arm . " Now , think , " she roared . <p> A couple of crows cawed over their heads and perched on the shovel and pick in the truck . The old man watched them and scratched and smiled . " Put me ... put me in mind a my pappy . Said he carried a pick . He uz diggin ' fer gold .... " <p> " No , no ! " said Miss Potts . " The Flying Hawk . " <p> " He uz diggin ' away an ' there come up a rattler rattlin ' away .... " <p> " Whiskey can get him switched off the track , " the granddaughter observed with a bob of her hair . " Someone that 's old , they is delicate made . " <p> " Caleb , hide the shovel and pick in the cab .... My good woman , you seem to be full of invention .... " <p> Caleb went off to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Potts , and holding it , hollered into his ear , with astonishing violence in view of her previous absence of vigor . The hens scattered . The crows took flight . It sounded to Caleb like " Cannonball ! " " It shakes him outa wherever he 's at . " <p> " I assume he saw action in the War , " said Miss Potts . <p> It seemed to work , for he slipped back into . The Flying Hawk as if he had never strayed from it . He nodded his head . " I recollec ' he said ... he said ... he said there was a gentleman from south a here had a fineblooded hoss had thowed a shoe . Finest hoss he ever seed . He shoed his hoss an ' the gentleman give ' ira a piece a silver .... Ai n't money ... ai n't money ... ai n't money .... " <p> The old man clearly suffered a need to prime his speech with a couple of words , and then he threatened to stick on them . " Give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He tol ' me ... he tol ' me ... he tol ' me he kep ' it all them ... all them years an ' carried it with ' im to bring ' im luck . He said it done it . It brung ' im luck . Ai n't nothin ' better'n luck , by God . " He flashed his gums . " He showed it me . It shore was purty . Had leetle hoofs an ' all , it did . He give it ' cause he said ... he said ... he said ... " <p> He seemed to stick . Miss Potts leaned forward and thumped him lightly . He went straight on ' " My granpappy put ' ira in mind a his boy back home uz mighty nigh twelve as same as him , an ' he said ... he said ... he had another un ' good as borned , an ' he uz aimin ' to make it home afore it come , an ' that uz why he needed that boss as bad as he done ... an ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ granpappy done the shoein ' that leetle hoss had hoofs an ' all .... " <p> Miss Potts fairly trumpeted into his horn . " What was the name ? The name of the man ? " <p> He scratched his stomach and shook his head , and suddenly he fell asleep . <p> " Was the name Davis ? " Miss Potts was hoarse . But he slept with a peaceful smile on his face . " Could we have the ' Cannonball ' once more ? " <p> But his granddaughter firmly flung her locks . " When he goes to sleep , ai n't nothin ' you can say . Dynamite wo n't bring ' im back . " <p> Miss Potts fell back in her chair quite limp . " I do believe I have yelled the stiffening out of my bones . " She poured some whiskey down her throat . " A medicinal need , " she croaked to Caleb . <p> " Yes , ma'am , " he said . <p> She poured some more and corked the bottle . She restored it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yelled the hairpins out of her hair . Caleb thought the back of her looked like a windmill . <p> " This has been a physical encounter indeed , " she told them brightly , clearing her throat again and again . " Caleb , be good enough to put the hamper back in the truck . Madam , I thank you for the lemonade and for the use of your interesting kin , who I 'm sure is very dear to you . We have primed the pump , yes , primed the pump . He may recall something later on , and here is my card . I 'd be much obliged if you 'd get in touch . " She rummaged around in her beaded purse and found a card . " If the names of Davis or Nancy surface , we 'll return for a glass of your fine lemonade . " <p> Caleb heard it and set his jaw . He told himself that nothing that even came close to this was ever ... ever ... ever ( he found that he was stuck on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... about to suck him in again . <p> He could n't get out of there fast enough . His tires spit dust . He found a store down the road that sold gas . Miss Potts did n't offer to pay for any . He guessed this trip was supposed to be his . She was pulling the Britannica out of her hamper to read to him in a rusty voice . " A forest madonna , ' they have called her , Caleb . I am reading , Caleb . Good-looking , sensitive , pious , with an air that seemed to bespeak a different social world from the one in which she moved . ' You could improve on the language here . I have utterly no use for the word bespeak . ' She was also something of a dreamer , it says . I suppose you could n't take notes and drive . " <p> " No , ma'am , " he said . <p> She suddenly clapped the volume shut . " We may have occasion to write the Britannica . " She pulled out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrewd and dark and lonesome . She was ' shaken with sacred desires , ' he says . Caleb , my boy , you have yet to learn when it comes to desire how close the sacred and profane can be , how swiftly one can turn into the other . " <p> Miss Potts 's voice was low and husky . He guessed it was from the shouting she 'd done . But maybe the whiskey was part of it , for he smelled it strong in the air of the cab . She sounded the way they did in the movies . " She is drawn to this gentleman from the South with all his land and his blooded horses . Her superior lineage is drawn to his . And he sees in her ... a forest madonna but something more . No woman like this has ever cleaned chamber of his before .... She was there for him . That day he took her . " <p> " Took her where , ma'am ? " <p> She shook her head and grew more husky . " He knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it ... this dreaming woman , who knows she was formed for a better thing . Vulnerable ... " <p> He happened to glance aside at her . Miss Potts had the eyes of Hedy Lamarr on the sign in front of the picture show : dreaming and sultry , the signboard read . Miss Potts 's hair had come undone . She was Venus rising out of the sea . She did n't see him there at all . It just about scared him into a wreck . He gripped the wheel . He reckoned she thought she was Nancy Hanks with maybe her desires gone ' into a switch . <p> The sun was getting low in the west . He guessed he had forty more miles of this . Suddenly she snapped herself out of it . " I have utterly no use for such a man ! But we must n't dwell too much on this . Just let your paper make it clear that Samuel Davis is the father of us all ... of North and South ... of Abraham Lincoln and Jefferson Davis ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to the Civil War and state its cause . " <p> The lemonade was sour in his throat . " Ma'am , you ai n't told me what is the cause . " <p> " Envy , Caleb ! The green-eyed monster . One brother reared in poverty , the other enjoying the best of things . Do n't you think that Nancy revealed her secret to Abraham ? On her deathbed perhaps , if not before . Or her husband did . Or Mary Gilpin , who wrote the diary . Or that friend of hers with the husband Seth . You can be sure he found it of interest , and you can be sure it stuck in his craw . Cain , you recall , was jealous of Abel . " <p> " You mean that Lincoln started shootin ' at us just because his brother had more money than him ? " <p> " Not just more money , Caleb , of course . Position . Standing . Gentle rearing on a fine estate , darkies to saddle his blooded horse . A university education . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he knew he would never start a war about it . Miss Potts was humming a little tune . She smelled like his aunt 's fruitcakes in the . fall , doused good with wine and waiting around till Christmastime . <p> The closer Caleb got to home , the more he really got depressed . The shovel had slid under his foot . The pick was shifting with every bump . He thought that maybe just listening to yells had taken the stiffening out of his bones . He did n't see that for all the yelling and all the gas he had any hard facts to use . He did n't know whether to mention it , but when he drove up to the vine-covered house he gritted his teeth and said it out . <p> " Well , Caleb , " said Miss Potts with a quiet smile . " You show a want of imagination . What we have learned has done a very great deal for me . It gives me the courage of my conviction . " Suddenly aware of her tail of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . <p> " Yes , ma'am , " he said . <p> She put on her hat and sprang to life . " Let the scholars bludgeon it out , " she cried in a voice that echoed her brush with Putney . " You will hand them the weapons . " In the fading light her eyes were dark and plump as raisins soaked in brandy . " Let ' em bash out one another 's brains . Let ' em hash out every trivial detail . You will give them the bones of history . They can chew on these bones "  --  she gave him a militant , daring glance  --  " until hell freezes over ! " <p> He was feeling dizzy  --  from the force of her words or the scent of her breath . " Ma'am , " he said , " I wish you 'd take credit for them bones yourself . " <p> " Nonsense , " she said . " It 's your paper . It 's your prize .... <p> " She bounced it to him : " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncle 's truck . " <p> " It 's your bones . " <p> " Ma'am , " he said , " before . it gets dark , do you mind puttin ' that governor back on ? I 'm just not sure I know how to do it . " <p> " Of course I will ... I was once a forest madonna myself , one with a tool in her hand , you could say . You 'd never have caught me cleaning his chamber . I 'd have been shoeing his horse instead . " <p> She hopped out then and went under the hood , while Caleb slumped in the seat , his pride of youth , his masculine dignity down the drain . <p> " Well , Caleb , " she said , pulling her hamper loose from the pick , " do I sense a failure of spirit here ? See yourself in the line of scrimmage . Tackle this thing . Go to it , go to it , and run with the . ball ! " <p> " Yes , ma'am , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is mightier than the sword . Mightier than the swords of Lincoln and Davis . Pick up your pen ! " <p> " Yes , ma'am , " he said . <p> <p> By HELEN NORRIS <p>
