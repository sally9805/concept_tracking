When Kishore Mahbubani spoke recently in New York City , he drew a glittering crowd of diplomats , bankers and politicians . It was an impressive audience for Singapore 's U.N . ambassador , but Mahbubani is impressive , a diplomat-philosopher whose book , Can Asians Think ? ( Times Editions ; $9.95 ) , has made him a must-meet thinker . <P> The book has been controversial , not because Mahbubani offers a particularly lurid answer to the title question  --  actually , he equivocates  --  but because of his belief that Asia is destined for greater world power , at American expense . Critics have called him anti-Western , but Mahbubani 's argument is really with Western arrogance , with leaders who insist capitalism and democracy are the answer for all nations . In fact , he says , the West 's hubris is accelerating its decline and polluting relations with proud , ambitious nations such as China and Japan . <P> Even at his most strident , Mahbubani writes with a diplomat 's charm , gleefully untangling political knots into simple threads . The book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is a prototype 21st century leader  --  he has his own URL  --  and a leading candidate to one day succeed Kofi Annan as U.N . Secretary-General . That pedigree is surely responsible for some of his buzz , but the ambassador 's book is anything but a faddish flash . <P>  --  By Joshua Cooper Ramo
