What could cause a stock market crash ? it 's an intriguing question with no real answer , other than some kind of surprise . My bet is that it would take a whopper . The bull market is so strong that to send the Dow careening would take something truly out of this world . Here 's how it might unfold one day : <P> 8:30 a.m . E.T. : The government reports record low unemployment . On CNBC economist Stephen Roach at Morgan Stanley declares that everyone who wants a job has one . He expects an inflationary spiral in wages . <P> 9:30 a.m. : The market opens ; inflation-wary traders send the Dow plunging 160 points as interest rates soar . <P> 10:51 a.m. : Individual investors begin buying the hardest-hit stocks , and the market stabilizes ; Coca-Cola schedules a press conference for 1 p.m . <P> 11:01 a.m. : Ed Yardeni at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell and other economists hit the wires saying that rising wages will not lead to inflation in this new era . Institutions , recalling that folks like Roach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year , start buying . The Dow recovers . <P> 11:37 a.m. : A radio station near Sedona , Ariz. , reports a 20-mile UFO  --  unconfirmed , as usual ; the Dow is rallying , as usual . <P> 12:49 p.m. : President Clinton refuses to sign a tax-reform bill , and Newt Gingrich proclaims the capital-gains tax-rate cut dead , raising the specter of government gridlock . The Dow surges 200 points because , well , gridlock has been very profitable in the ' 90s , and now there 's no incentive to sell so , heck , buy ! <P> 12:56 p.m. : Saddam Hussein offers proof that he has nukes , and says , by the way , he 'd really like to rule Kuwait . Oil prices soar . No one thinks about inflation ; it 's dead . The Dow jumps to a 265-point gain , led by Chevron and Exxon . <P> 1 p.m. : Coke discloses that a pair of garage scientists has duplicated its famous syrup and is selling the formula worldwide . Warren Buffett , proclaiming that the company is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise anyway as the company , one of the biggest in the major-stock indexes , benefits from the mindless buying of stock-index funds . The Dow is up 400 points . <P> 1:15 p.m. : Arizona state police confirm the presence of a UFO . It has landed , and aliens are trying to communicate . The rally pauses briefly . <P> 1:23 p.m. : CNN airs the first photos . A gauntlet of exterior ray guns is visible , and the UFO is presumed hostile . The Dow is up 500 , led by defense contractors , security and firearms companies , and any that bottle or can food and drink . <P> 2:17 p.m. : The aliens are now speaking fluent English . They are n't hostile after all . They 're here to cut a deal : if we leave their ancient burial grounds on Mars alone , they 'll give us technology that is 15 centuries ahead of our time . It will enable us to eliminate world illness and suffering instantly and to make society so productive that everyone will enjoy peace and prosperity . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might as well be a buggy whip ; Windows 98 a manual typewriter . As sky-high tech stocks become worthless , everything follows , and from the elite on Wall Street to the masses in mutual funds , they begin to think maybe , just maybe , they ought not take the deal . <P> Daniel Kadlec is TIME 's Wall Street columnist .
