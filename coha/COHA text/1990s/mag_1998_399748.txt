THREE YEARS AGO , NEWS CORP . CEO RUPERT MURDOCHthe grand pooh-bah of the Fox network-leaned back in his throne and scratched his head , trying to figure out how to rescue his net 's struggling new **27;271;TOOLONG drama , Party of Five . He dialed then-entertainment president John Matoian and pointed out that fires seemed to sell newspapers , so , hey , why not torch P05 's Salinger house ? Matoian met with the show 's creators , Christopher Keyser and Amy Lippman , who listened to the suggestion and then did what any sensible rookie producers eager to stay on the air would do . They said no-and sent Matoian a fire extinguisher for good measure . * " Chris and Amy were always so unflinching about sticking with the vision , " chuckles Matoian . " It was frustrating at times , but you 'd think , Wow , these guys have an idea and are willing to go down with the ship if necessary . And then you 'd want to say , Well , maybe this ship is worth saving . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jennifer Garner and Eion Bailey ; executive producers Amy Lippman and Chris Keyser ; Party of Five 's Scott Wolf and Jennifer Love Hewitt ; Others ' Scott Bairstow // Thanks to the pairs unwavering convictions-not to mention the shows refreshingly honest dialogue and engaging cast-P05 eventually did catch on ( imagine , a gushy family drama with coveted demographics and cool cred among Gen-Xers ! ) . Now Keyser and Lippman are heating up a new Fox drama , Significant Others , debuting March 11 in the Party time slot ( P05 returns in late April ) . So how do the producers plan to entice eyeballs to the screen this time ? Obnoxiously high-stakes plots ? Triple-crossed murders ? Incestuous amnesiac doctors ? " We 'll deal with what friendship and love mean to people in their 20s , " says Lippman with typical thoughtfulness . " How it 's kind of nebulous and the dynamics change all the time . " ( This must be the point in the pitch meeting when the twitching Fox exec asks hopefully , " So ... when do we get to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you wish-we suggest The So-Called Relativity of My Twentysomething Life Goes On-but Others seems to resemble its older sister only in broad strokes : intricately woven story lines , realistically damaged characters , generous helpings of angst , a damn fine-looking cast . " The tone of this show is a little lighter and zanier , which opens us up to people who do n't want a drama that drives them to drink , " notes Keyser . " It 's about that inevitable passage you go through from not being responsible to having to be responsible . " IF YOU 'RE LOOKING FOR A HEARTY rite-of-passage story , check out the r6sumes of Keyser , 37 , and Lippman , 34 . The writer-producers first met at Harvard in 1985 , and a few years later , after moving to L.A. with their future spouses , they became business partners-to mixed results ( good : wrote episodes for L.A. Law and Equal Justice ; bad : passed up jobs on Law &; Order to work on a Jaclyn Smith TV movie ) . After three seasons on NBC 's menopausal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked them to create a kids-ontheir-own series . Of course , the network was thinking along the lines of 90210 . Instead it got Nietzsche for Neophytes . Though P05 promptly endeared itself to critics , the bummer of a premise did n't grab viewers , and the show hung by a pinky finger from the cliff of cancellation ( even though the duo did cheekily write a restaurant fire subplot into an early P05 episode-a wink at Murdoch 's odd request ) . " It 's impossible to describe what it felt like to be as beleaguered as we were , working around the clock , " recalls Keyser . " But some of our best work came during that pressure of almost being canceled 12 times . " Then one day , the show won a Golden Globe . Youth-hungry mags wanted Neve Campbell and Jennifer Love Hewitt on their covers . The cult of teens sprouted into a wider audience . ( P05 is the only returning Big Four drama with ratings growth this season . ) Lifetime recently agreed to shell out more than $55 million to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week , Fox paid $80 millionplus to renew P05 for two more seasons . Keyser and Lippman are also hot properties : With several TV studios eager to snap the pair up , their current home , Columbia TriStar ( which produces P05 and Others ) , is intensely wooing them to renew their contracts . " Chris and Amy write dramas layered with reality and dimension , " says current Fox Entertainment president Peter Roth ( who calls them every Wednesday at 10:01 p.m. , literally in tears , acting out scenes from that night 's P05 episode ) . " There 's nothing cooler than honest relationships . " But if you think that the masters of twentysomething zeitgeist must be **26;300;TOOLONG Gen-X subversives , think again . " You would n't look at them and go , Wow , I bet those guys are really hip ! " ' notes Hewitt ( Sarah on Party of Five ) . " But then you read their words and that makes them very cool . " LOOKING TO DOUBLE THEIR COOL quotient , Keyser and Lippman saw an opening to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sank last season . ( NBC and ABC expressed interest , but the producers stayed at Fox . " It 's hard to say no to the people responsible for your career , " reasons Lippman . ) They mapped out a best-friend triangle : schemerdreamer Campbell ( Eion Bailey ) , cheery flake Nell ( Jennifer Garner ) , and needy Ivy League graduate cum-porn writer Henry ( Scott Bairstow ) . Adjuncts to the L.A.-based threesome are Campbell 's label-conscious older brother , Ben ( Michael Weatherly ) , and Ben 's cleancut wife , Jane ( Elizabeth Mitchell ) . Photograph The thing about Chris and Amy is not just how smart they are but that they 're normal , family people , " says Garner . " They are about the least Hollywoody producers you could have . " // Fleshing out Others " concept was easy ; finding the right people was not . Production was delayed three months while the producers screened hundreds of actors , hoping to repeat P05 's uncanny casting . At first , Garner did n't want to do TV . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( " After I did my first reading , they asked my age , and I 'm like , " Uh ... yeah ... um ... " " recalls Bailey . " And they said , No , no , it 's okay , just tell us . ' And I said , " Uh , 21 ? " and the whole room just deflated . " ) He was later called back when they decided to go younger than planned . Meanwhile , Bairstow dropped out when he found out the show would n't be shot in his home base of Seattle , where it was originally set . Learning the bad news on her mobile phone , Lippman drove her car onto the shoulder of the road and made a flurry of calls . When she reached Bairstow at home , she did everything she could to coax him back . " He told me , I 'm sure that next to childbirth , this is one of the hardest days of your life , " ' she remembers , " and I said , Childbirth was nothing compared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the puzzle . " ' Lippman and Keyser ultimately succeeded at moving the pieces into place , and now with six episodes ready to go , Others ' fate is in the hands of viewers . " It may take a while for the audience to invest in the show , " warns Keyser . " That 's the nature of these light ensemble dramas . " Just in case , do the pair have any can't-miss ratings gimmicks up their sleeves ? " No one will be murdered , " assures Lippman . " No incest . No abuse ... and no fires .
