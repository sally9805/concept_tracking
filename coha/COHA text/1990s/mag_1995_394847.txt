The plan looked good . For decades astronomers had been at one another 's throats over the age or the universe , and they thought they could resolve their feud by using NASA 's Hubble Space Telescope . The hawk-eyed telescope would scrutinize galaxies in the Virgo Cluster , whose location anchors the extragalactic distance scale . The distance scale , in turn , determines the Hubble constant , a number that gives the rate at which the universe expands , and indicates the universe 's age . To measure the distance to the Virgo Cluster , the Hubble Space Telescope would look for Cepheid variable stars in the cluster 's spiral galaxies . Cepheids are pulsating stars whose intrinsic brightness astronomers know . By comparing a Cepheid 's apparent brightness to its real brightness , an astronomer can calculate how far away the Cepheid , and its host galaxy , is . Combining the distance of a Virgo Cluster galaxy and its redshift ( the speed at which it recedes from Earth ) would yield the long-sought Hubble Constant . Things did n't work out quite that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faulty mirror , a team led by Michael Pierce of Indiana University scooped NASA 's pricey telescope by arming a telescope in Hawaii with a powerful camera that spotted three Cepheids in one Virgo galaxy . " The evidence strongly suggests that the extragalactic distance scale is now established , " Pierce says , " and the Hubble constant is around 85 kilometers per second per megaparsec . " In short , Pierce contends , the great dispute is over at last . Other astronomers vehemently disagree . " I think it 's absurd , " says Wendy Freedman of the Carnegie Observatories in Pasadena , California , an expert on Cepheids . " The controversy is not over . To say , based on three candidate Cepheids , that the controversy is over does n't make any sense . " A month after Pierce published his result , Freedman and her colleagues announced that the Hubble Space Telescope had discovered 20 Cepheids in another Virgo galaxy . Although her distance for the Virgo Cluster matches that of Pierce 's team , Freedman says it will be years before astronomers agree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotly disputed Hubble constant . Welcome to the Hubble War The Hubble constant is certainly worth fighting over : It measures the rate at which the universe is expanding and indicates its age . Many astronomers believe the universe is expanding slowly and that the Hubble constant is low , between 40 and 50 kilometers per second per megaparsec . ( A parsec is 3.26 light-years . ) If so , the universe is old , between 13 and 22 billion years old , because a slowly expanding universe would take a long time to attain its present size . In recent years , though , many astronomers have measured a much higher value for the Hubble constant , between 80 and 90 kilometers per second per megaparsec ( see " Candles to Light the Night , " September 1994 ) . If this higher value is correct , it implies hat the universe is young , with an age between 7 and 11 billion years . Such a youthful universe poses a paradox , because some stars are thought to be 15 billion years old . In principle , determining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's redshift ( in kilometers per second ) by its distance ( in megaparsecs ) and you 've got the answer . Measuring the redshift is easy ; so is measuring the distance , if the galaxy is close enough for you to see its Cepheids . These bright yellow stars pulsate , contracting and expanding periodically , waxing and waning in brightness . The longer its pulsation period , the bigger and brighter the Cepheid , so observing its period reveals the star 's mean intrinsic brightness , its average brightness output . Comparing this with the Cepheid 's mean apparent brightness then yields the distance to both the star and its galaxy . For a given redshift , the smaller the galaxy 's distance , the greater the Hubble constant . Unfortunately , until recently Cepheids had been seen only in nearby galaxies , which are perturbed by the gravity of our Galaxy and others . As a result , the redshifts of nearby galaxies do not fully reflect the universe 's expansion and so do not reveal the Hubble constant . For most of this century , astronomers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of galaxies . Although no one knew the cluster 's exact distance , astronomers did know that Virgo was far enough away that they could use it to probe the universe 's expansion , yet close enough that someday they would detect the cluster 's Cepheids , determine its distance , and thereby establish the Hubble constant . Cepheids in Virgo That someday has arrived . On September 29 , 1994 , Michael Pierce and his colleagues published in Nature their investigation of a spiral galaxy in Virgo named NGC 4571 . " What allowed us to succeed where others had failed was the development of the high-resolution camera , called HRCam , on the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope on Mauna Kea , " he says . This camera corrects distortions caused by atmospheric turbulence and provides a much sharper view of a galaxy 's stars , including its Cepheids , than the traditional cameras did . These Cepheids revealed NGC 4571 's distance . Pierce 's distance is small and thus his Hubble constant high . The Cepheids indicate that NGC 4571 is only 15 megaparsecs away . By assuming that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he finds the Hubble constant to be 87 +/-7 kilometers per second per megaparsec . This impacts the controversy over the Hubble constant , because the two warring sides claim different distances for the Virgo Cluster . Those who think the Hubble constant is high say that Virgo is only 14 to 15 megaparsecs away , while those who favor a low Hubble constant place it much farther , at a distance of 21 to 23 megaparsecs . Pierce 's team began work in 1991 , after problems with Hubble surfaced . " We were as upset as anyone when the problems with Space Telescope became apparent , " says Pierce . " But given my interest in the distance-scale problem , I did n't want to wait around for possibly five years to see if the fix was going to be made . I wanted to know what the distance to the Virgo Cluster based on Cepheids was . " The team completed observations in 1993 , before Hubble was fixed . Pierce does not plan to observe Cepheids in other Virgo galaxies , for Hubble now gives sharper views @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believes that he and the Hubble group will achieve the same results . " Because we are confident in our work , " says Pierce , " we fully expect that in the end their distance will agree with ours . " In 1994 , after Hubble was repaired , Wendy Freedman and her colleagues took aim at M100 , another Virgo spiral . " When we first started to look for Cepheids in M100 , they jumped out . It was incredibly easy , much easier than anticipated . " Her team found a relatively small distance to the galaxy , 17 megaparsecs , and a high Hubble constant , 80 +/- 17 . Within the uncertainties , these numbers agree with those of Pierce . Such high values for the Hubble constant imply that the universe is uncomfortably young . For example , if the Hubble constant is 80 , then the universe is only 8 to 11 billion years old , much younger than its most ancient stars . That , of course , is a logical impossibility , one that troubles many astronomers . The Old Universe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I hope you 're not believing all the nonsense in the press , " says Allan Sandage of the Carnegie Observatories . For over two decades , Sandage has maintained that the Hubble constant is 50 and the universe old , and the recent results have n't changed his mind . He has been measuring the Hubble constant longer than both Pierce and Freedman combined ; in fact , when he was a graduate student , he was the observing assistant it to Edwin Hubble himself . Sandage 's critique of the new work is simple : The two spiral galaxies , NGC 4571 and M100 , are not in the core of the Virgo Cluster . " No spiral lies in the Virgo Cluster 's core , " he says . " The spirals are spread in a 15-degree diameter about the core , so the distance to any given spiral does not of and by itself tell you the distance to the core . " Only the elliptical galaxies in Virgo reside near the core , he says , whereas spirals such as NGC 4571 and M100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . Pierce counters that his galaxy , NCC 4571 , is at the core because the galaxy has been stripped of its outer envelope of hydrogen gas . This , he says , indicates that the galaxy is passing through the hot gas in Virgo 's core , which has torn off the galaxy 's hydrogen envelope . But Sandage is n't convinced . Unlike Pierce , Freedman agrees with Sandage 's point that any one spiral may not share the distance of Virgo 's core . " That is our biggest uncertainty , " she says . " Anytime you have a sample of one , you can be unlucky . " She does not assume that her galaxy is at the Virgo core but instead says it could be 20 percent nearer or farther . This is the main reason her error bar on the Hubble constant is much larger than Pierce 's , even though the Hubble Space Telescope gives clearer views or Virgo 's Cepheids and more precise data on their varying brightnesses . " Ultimately , " she says , " we need to measure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her colleagues will use the Hubble Space Telescope to search for Cepheids in two other spirals in Virgo . This will yield an average that should indicate Virgo 's distance more reliably . All three astronomers , Pierce , Freedman , and Sandage , agree one galaxy lies at or near the Virgo core : M87 , the giant elliptical that anchors the cluster . Unfortunately , M87 has no Cepheids because elliptical galaxies are made up of old stars , and Cepheids are young . Like Freedman , Sandage uses the Hubble Space Telescope to search Virgo spirals for Cepheids , but his strategy differs . " We will never make the argument that the distance of a spiral galaxy in the Virgo region defines any distance to the core , " he says . Instead , Sandage wants to know the distances of those spirals because they have spawned type la supernovae . " These are among the best standard candles we know , " says Sandage . Type la supernovae are thought to arise from white dwarfs that swallowed gas from a companion star , exploding when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because all the stars are the same , the explosions should peak at the same luminosity . Also , these supernovae are extremely bright , so they can be seen in galaxies that are billions of light-years distant . Thus , Sandage argues , type la supernovae , coupled with Cepheids , should yield a definitive value for the Hubble constant . Before Hubble was repaired , Sandage 's team detected Cepheids in two galaxies that had produced type la supernovae : IC 4182 in Canes Venatici and NGC 5253 in Centaurus . The Cepheid distances they measured gave an intrinsic brightness for the type la supernovae that , when applied to supernovae in distant galaxies , yielded a Hubble constant of only 52 +/- 6 . Those who reject this Hubble constant , though , argue that all type la supernovae are not equally luminous . So to counter this criticism , Sandage wants to detect Cepheids in other galaxies in which type la supernovae have erupted . If all those supernovae peaked at the same intrinsic brightness , he says , that should convince the skeptics . Freedman next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a simpler galaxy cluster than Virgo . " The Fornax Cluster appears to be a fairly tight cluster , " she says , " so its galaxies should all be about the same distance from us . " Fornax is thought to be roughly as far as Virgo but lies in the opposite direction . These properties will give Freedman 's team another example to test their method 's accuracy , one that should not be handicapped by the argument that the galaxies are spread over a large area of space . Freedman 's team will also observe Cepheids in other galaxies , to calibrate various distance-measuring techniques that should nail down the Hubble constant once and for all . " I think that really is the guts of this , " says Freedman . " We are now in a position to get excellent high-quality data to calibrate a number of methods . Within the next three to four years , we will have a value of the Hubble constant accurate to 10 percent . When that happens and all astronomers agree on the numerical value of the Hubble constant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the size and age of the universe  --  will at last be resolved .
