Phil and Rebecca Ruble spent four years transforming their 1950s house . Take a look at what the young Tulsa couple has accomplished . The house was one of those anonymous redbrick homes built by the thousands in postwar suburbs all across the country . " Structurally it was okay , but it did n't have any character , " says owner Phil Ruble . Working with Tulsa architect Alan Madewell , Phil and his wife , Rebecca , gave the house its own special personality , both inside and out . The mostly do-it-yourself remodeling was a nightsand-weekends project that took four years-four long years . But it was worth it for the Rubles . On the outside , they gave the house an English cottage look , with Tudor overtones . They replaced the garage door with a new overhead door that was ordered with a vertical-grooved plywood facing . Then wood trim was added . The result is the look of a pair of hinged doors but with the convenience of an automatic overhead door .

Photograph Before renovation , the kitchen hugged the walls , leaving wasted space in the center . The completely remodeled kitchen includes a 5-x 8-foot island with granite countertops . Recessed downlights brighten and define the space . French doors open onto a new deck . // To add character to the gables , Alan suggested replacing the existing vinyl siding with hand-cut , beveled redwood siding with a subtle undulating bottom edge . Phil used a saber saw to make the cut . For an increased sense of support , Alan suggested replacing the porch 's original 4 x 4 posts with 6 x 6 posts and adding two more at each corner . Notched , curved brackets add to the cottage feel . To tone down the bright-red brick , they sprayed it with white acrylic-latex opaque stain and wiped the still-wet stain with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paint with a rag to give the brick the effect of a time-worn surface . The brick looked great , but the mortar joints did n't . The porous mortar soaked up the stain faster than the harder brick , leaving the mortar joints looking too dark . " We tried all kinds of things and nothing worked , " says Phil . " Finally , Rebecca painted every joint with white latex paint . " Inside the house , the Rubles removed sections of walls , widening the doorways between living room , dining room , and kitchen . The result is an open , bright IL-shaped space . Although the three rooms had to be redone with new gypsum drywall and molding , the original mantel was saved . To provide an attractive backdrop for it , Alan suggested floor-to-ceiling paneling . Instead of solid wood they used 1/4inch beaded-board plywood for the paneling and 3/4-inch birch veneer plywood for the frame . " That way , you do n't have the expansion and contraction problems , " he says . The kitchen underwent the most dramatic change . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countertops . The washer and dryer sat out in the open . The Rubles gutted the kitchen down to the studs . The new floor is limestone-look 12- x 12-inch ceramic tiles , the cabinets are stained wood , and the countertops are granite . In the center of the room a 5 x 8-foot island has a drop-in range and lots of workspace . A 43-inch-high wall at one end of the island gives a sense of separation from the dining room without blocking views . This is especially important to Rebecca , who says , " I like to cook , and I feel I 'm involved with the whole family now . " Although the project took a lot longer than expected , Phil says , " You learn as you go . You make a mistake and then redo it , " he adds . " It 's been fun . " <p>
