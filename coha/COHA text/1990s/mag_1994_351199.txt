Who are America 's hottest playwrights ? Some are fast-rising newcomers and some are old hands . But nobody is faster rising or more of an old hand than Pierre de Carlet Chamblain de Marivaux , who in the past few years has vaulted from a footnote or curiosity to a leading dramatist at the nation 's nonprofit houses  --  and who has been dead since 1763 . This season alone has seen at least eight major productions involving four plays , from False Admissions at Connecticut 's Hartford Stage to The Triumph of Love at California 's Berkeley Repertory . Studio Arena Theatre in Buffalo , New York , is now playing The Game of Love and Chance ; a different translation of Triumph is running off- Broadway ; and Princeton 's McCarter troupe is rehearsing The Double Inconstancy , retranslated as Changes of Heart . <P> Marivaux 's plays were long derided as being wordy , high-flown and much alike  --  they are all about the lengths to which people will go , the rules they will break and the indignities they will suffer in pursuit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , European and avant-garde American stagings often emphasized the dark elements of his work . At the other extreme , some scholars saw only his fascination with Italian commedia dell'arte buffoonery . The premier Marivaux exponent Stephen Wadsworth , who directed his translation of Triumph at Berkeley and is staging his text of Changes of Heart at McCarter , thinks any successful production mingles both flavors : " Marivaux 's plays all combine joy and ebullience with a savagely acute perception of how people operate . He wants to leave you on the horns of a dilemma . You can not simply like his characters for what they are or simply dislike them for what they do . " <P> This moral complexity is one reason for Marivaux 's popularity in a cynical time . Another is his obsession with sex and its consequences . Says artistic director Mark Lamos of Hartford : " We 're in an age where we can only talk about sex , not have it . These plays are a roundelay of sexual enticement . " A third factor , Lamos adds , is that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so there is a natural movement toward the less familiar . " <P> In Buffalo there is merriment but no melancholy . The translation provides for commedia improvisations and further toys with the original by casting the actors both as the Marivaux characters and as a 1930s British touring troupe performing the play . The evening is fun . But it reveals little of why Lamos and others think Marivaux may be genuinely great . <P> The off-Broadway Triumph , however , makes the case . Its heroine , a princess disguised as a man , seeks the hand of a prince from a deposed rival family . To get her way , she bullies servants and promises to marry the prince 's unworldly guardians  --  an austere philosopher who spots her true gender and his matronly sister , who does n't . The production is vividly pretty . What makes it work , though , is its edge , sharper than Shakespeare 's in similar plots  --  especially when the bamboozled guardians realize they have been cast aside and stare with shame and despair into a slowly fading light . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
