How big a wallet do you need to knock the $100 billion-a-year local-telephone industry into a new shape ? J. Shelby Bryan , 51 , CEO of ICG Communications , Inc. , of Englewood , Colo. , is trying to find out . Bryan , a former Golden Gloves boxer as well as a banker , entrepreneur and corporate-turnaround artist , took charge of ICG , then known as IntelCom Group , in 1995 . A good time to jump in , given the impending passage of the federal Telecommunications Act of 1996 , which ordered the Baby Bell phone companies to end their monopolies of local service . Now Bryan is trying to outsprint other new companies by offering phone service via electrical-utility lines . <P> Bryan 's approach is a radical departure from the way most of America 's myriad new telephone companies have plotted their growth . Most have tried to break into local-phone markets on the cheap by negotiating with the incumbent to lease and resell service on its lines . Bryan 's company decided to exploit a provision in the act that allows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern fiber-optic communications networks to monitor plants and transmission over wide areas , and Bryan offered to use their extra capacity for phone service . Last year , for example , ICG signed a deal with Southern California Edison and won rights to use the utility 's 1,260 miles of lines and switches spanning the key markets of Los Angeles and San Diego . Building such a " backbone " for a local telecommunications network from scratch would have cost much more time and money . <P> The second focus was on building new lines and switches out from these utilities and as stand-alone new networks to offer alternative service in key markets where demand for state-of-the-art data , long-distance and local calling was high . Similar deals were rolled out through the rest of 1996 . ICG signed with Midwest giant American Electric Power to offer communications in Columbus and Canton , Ohio . Cascade , a Westford , Mass. , company , will supply frame-relay devices to ICG 's burgeoning Northern California network , allowing the Bay Area 's techie firms to avoid Internet overload . Additional networks are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as ICG 's motto puts it , " the dominant alternative to the local exchange monopoly " costs a bundle . Capital spending of $228 million last year outweighed $190 million in sales . Bryan has raised a $1.1 billion war chest ; without deregulation , he says , " the financial markets would n't have been open to us . " But a payoff is in sight . In Ohio , where the company is attempting to woo customers away from Ameritech , ICG marketers ' cold calls have led to a remarkable 50% in follow-up appointments . Bryan says ICG will probably have a positive cash flow next year . <P> No new phone network can stand alone entirely , especially at this early stage of reform . Even around ICG 's Denver home base , the quality of ICG 's service depends on the cooperation of US West . Though the new act is designed to encourage the Bells to allow would-be rivals interconnect  --  in order to qualify for permission to enter the long-distance business  --  US West seems stubborn about letting its rival come aboard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncooperative . Just a scintilla of movement either way can make our lives livable or miserable . "
