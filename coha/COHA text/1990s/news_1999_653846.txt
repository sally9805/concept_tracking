<p> A secretary plans to buy a summer home . A 36-year-old banker is already pondering retirement . <p> Chalk it up to stock . Not the Dow Jones industrial average , which briefly flirted with the 10,000 mark yesterday . But to stock in Wall Street 's last big private partnership , Goldman , Sachs &; Company , which detailed its plans to go public yesterday and offered a glimpse of how it will divide as much as $24 billion in projected net worth . <p> Goldman said substantially all of its 13,000 employees will get a stake in the blue-chip investment bank when it sells shares this spring . The general partners who currently own the firm will get substantially more  --  the average value of their shares will reach about $50 million . But employees below that level will share a $5 billion windfall  --  secretaries , janitors and word processors included . <p> " It 's not like winning the lottery ; we earned it , " insisted a corporate secretary at Goldman 's beige-stone headquarters on 85 Broad Street , catty-cornered to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little like the lottery , I guess , because it 's not the kind of pay you get every day . " <p> Not on Wall Street , anyway . Though many of the Internet start- up companies that go public these days turn their founding employees into overnight millionaires , Goldman says it is the first securities firm , and one of the only companies in history , to share the spoils from a public offering with employees who have no ownership stake . It is sharing 20 percent of the firm 's estimated value , according to details provided in the formal registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission that the firm filed yesterday . <p> Under this share-the-wealth formula , a secretary in Hong Kong who took home $40,000 last year and has worked at the firm for five years will get a stock bonus worth about $25,000 , some of that in shares that can not be sold right away . A newly hired New York janitor might get $10,000 . One rising banker who earned half a million dollars last year said he expected to receive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though payments are not yet determined . <p> The formula is that every full-time employee will get stock valued at roughly one-half of their total take-home pay last year . They will also receive a bonus that varies with the number of years they have worked . <p> Partners , of course , will see the value of their stakes increase much more . Even the most junior of Goldman 's 221 partners , including 58 promoted only three months ago , will have shares valued at about $20 million if the public offering goes as planned , people close to Goldman 's planning said . The most senior partners , led by Henry M. Paulson Jr. , the chief executive , will see their holdings , on paper , rise to more than $190 million . <p> Goldman employees were not exactly clicking their heels as they knocked off work for the day yesterday . But many had trouble suppressing smiles despite the firm 's blanket ban on indulging the press , especially when it comes to the offering . <p> " We got lucky , " one young banking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his chauffered sedan from the line of black cars outside headquarters . " I just wish I got here a few years earlier . " <p> Goldman is the only major Wall Street firm that bucked the trend to go public in the 1970 's and 1980 's . Partners there said over and over that they did not want to sell shares because that would risk diluting the firm 's famously aggressive culture . Even more than other firms , Goldman is well known for keeping its bankers on call most hours of the day and night and elbowing its way to the top of the rankings in the most lucrative areas of finance . <p> But the record amount of money investors have been willing to pay for top securities firms recently  --  and Goldman 's worries about whether it has enough ammunition to compete in the new financial world of megacompanies  --  prompted a rethinking . Goldman partners first voted to go public last summer , only to have the plan derailed by the downturn in financial markets last fall . The offering was revived amid the strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to complete the offering by early May . <p> Goldman wants to sell the public 11 to 13 percent of its shares , raising perhaps as much as $3.45 billion for the firm and two of its outside investors . Depending on the price investors are finally willing to pay , the firm as a whole would have a market value of $18 billion to $24 billion , which would make it the third largest on Wall Street after Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and Merrill Lynch &; Company . <p> The firm disclosed in its filing yesterday that it lost $663 million in last year 's fourth quarter in an area of the business known as trading and proprietary investments , with most of that loss attributable to turmoil in the world bond market after Russia defaulted on its debt in August . Many other securities firms had trouble as well at that time , but the steep loss might keep Goldman , despite its premium brand name , from pricing its shares above those of its top rivals . Most analysts expect Goldman to sell at about a 10 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I was caught by surprise how much of their profits come from trading , and how that can really be volatile , " said Hal Schroeder , an expert on investment banks at Keefe , Bruyette &; Woods . " I do n't think that they have the earnings stability some other firms do , and so they will trade at a discount . " <p> Still , the offering will probably be the second largest in United States history , following Conoco 's $4.4 billion public offering last year . And Goldman now has momentum on its side , with the Dow gearing up to surpass 10,000 and Goldman 's earnings soaring . The firm reported first-quarter pretax earnings of $1.19 billion , up 16 percent from a year earlier , dispelling any notion that last year 's woes would hold back its performance in the first part of this year . <p> Goldman 's offering is unlikely to change the way it does business right after its public offering . Nearly half of the shares will still be owned by former partners , another 20 percent by employees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two outside shareholders , all of whom are expected to vote with management . It will be many years , and only after insiders begin selling their shares , that Goldman will genuinely become a publicly owned company . <p> Among the beneficiaries of the sale of stock are Goldman 's retired partners , many of whom still have investments in the firm . The so-called limited partners were given choices of receiving cash , a bond-like security , and stock . By about a margin of two and a half to one , the limited partners chose to take stock , people close to the firm said . Even so , Goldman plans to devote about $1.3 billion to satisfy demands from limited partners who chose to receive cash or bonds . <p> Two other major shareholders , Sumitomo Bank Capital Markets Inc. of Japan and Kamehameha Activities Association , a giant landowner and education fund in Hawaii , also stand to make a tidy profit from their Goldman investments . <p> Goldman also plans to endow a new charitable foundation with $200 million . The foundation will make Goldman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York area , but the firm has not spelled out its philanthropic mission . The amount for charity is less than the firm envisioned last fall , when it expected to raise a bit more money from going public . At that time , Goldman executives said they would commit $350 million to a foundation . <p> Many Goldman employees say the offering , though it will make them wealthier , will not immediately change their lives . All will receive restricted stock that can be sold only after several years . Some said that they did not plan to sell even then . <p> " I 'm not going to sell any shares , and I might buy some more , " said one woman who described herself as support staff . Long term , she said , the shares will come in handy . " They will put my kids through college . " <p> Others , however , have spending plans . One secretary said she and her husband have had their eyes on a summer vacation spot in upstate New York , where they have rented a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buying . <p> " My guess is that we 'll do it now , " she said . " Having a few more dollars should n't change your life . But it gives you a sense of security . " <p> The bulge-bracket earners at the firm have grander plans . One investment banker in his mid-30s , after about six years there , earns more than half a million dollars each year in salary and bonus . He expects to bank $1 million in shares when the offering is complete . If all goes as planned , he says he will be most of the way toward his own target of having $3.5 million in savings . He expects to retire shortly after Goldman allows him to sell shares . <p> " Let me tell you , this is a tough job and you think about moving on every day , " he said . " I love the place , but I do n't love it that much . " <p> Not everyone who works at 85 Broad Street will benefit . Goldman uses many temporary employees , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It means nothing to me , " said one woman , who said she has worked at Goldman for years but does not have full-time status . <p> And then there are the almost Goldmanites . Like Tapiwa , an African immigrant who caters to scores of Goldman clients at a nearby health club . He is going to business school soon and wants to work at Goldman , and his eyes lighted up when he spoke of the public offering . " What I hope is that they will do it again when I am there , " he said . <p> http : //www.nytimes.com If Goldman , Sachs goes public at a price that values the firm around $24 billion , here is how much insiders ' shares would be worth .
