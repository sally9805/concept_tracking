<p> So you think it 's tough having one house to get ready for Christmas . Imagine having 11 houses , like Lee Taylor , and doing all the housework yourself . <p> " Oh , I 'm always cleaning . Polishing all the silver is the worst part , " says Taylor , who in his spare time is building his 12th house  --  a Palladian-style , English country manor house . <p> All right , so Taylor 's houses are miniatures , one-twelfth the size of a normal house , theoretically making his work one-twelfth what it would be if his houses were life size ( as in human , not field mouse ) . That 's still a lot of furniture to dust , little rugs to shake out , tiny windows and mirrors to make sparkle for the holiday . Then there 's the decorating . Besides the house he lives in , Taylor always decorates one of the miniatures . <p> This year the replica of Glen Burnie , his own 18th-century Federal period house , is decked out in tinsel , bows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apple cone and swags of holly . The fruit is made of colored modeling clay , and the holly leaves are cut from floral tape . To hang the swags from the banister , Taylor used the tiny wire filaments that are bundled inside plastic-coated telephone wire . Even with the help of tweezers and a magnifying glass , it took him an entire day to get all the decorations in place . <p> Talking about miniatures exhausts the language 's supply of diminutives before long , so it 's probably best to avoid them ; likewise , words like adorable and cute get used up quickly . Then too , is a handcrafted eight-inch-high Hepplewhite secretary with solid gold pulls and delicate inlay " adorable " any more than a Faberge egg is " cute " ? Actually , it is . But that 's not the point : What makes Taylor 's pieces wonderful is that they are as exquisitely crafted as fine pieces of jewelry . Very often they cost as much . <p> Of course , there are miniatures of a lesser order  --  manufactured pieces that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are n't for kids to play with , although kids love them and it may be the child in Taylor and all of us that makes us susceptible to their charms . His pieces are museum quality and are meant to be looked at rather than touched . In fact , the finials on Taylor 's Hepplewhite secretary are so slender and delicate that the craftsman who made it advised Taylor never to touch them . <p> " It 's a fever , a disease , " says Taylor . " Once you start collecting you ca n't give it up . " <p> Taylor caught the miniature collecting fever in 1979 when a friend sent him a newspaper clipping about a miniature of Shadows on the Tesh , an 1830s mansion in New Iberia , La. , which has a magnificent columned porch . " I said to myself , hell , I could build that , and off I went , " Taylor recalls . <p> He was already an old-house enthusiast . Taylor and a friend , Julian Glass , have spent the past 35 years restoring their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with period pieces . So building miniatures was a natural hobby for Taylor . A neoclassical house such as Shadows on the Tesh , with its multitude of columns across the front , was a good place to start . " I 've always loved columns , " says Taylor . " The more columns a house has , the better . " <p> As both master builder and architect , with no client to satisfy , Taylor built his Shadows on the Tesh as he felt the original should have been built in the first place : with sweeping staircases in the entry hall . The actual Shadows has only exterior staircases , a detail not uncommon in the French colonial architecture of Louisiana . <p> Taylor was delighted with his new hobby . For only a few dollars plus the investment of time , he could build the houses of his dreams . If something did n't turn out , there was nothing lost . He would simply tear the house down in a few minutes , while sitting comfortably at his worktable , and start over  --  which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Just as a builder of big houses becomes conversant with stock materials available from a lumberyard , the builder of miniatures learns what 's available from dealers in miniature building materials . Builders frequent shops that specialize in miniatures , and haunt the hundreds of shows held across the country every year . <p> Taylor goes to about 25 shows a year , traveling as far as California to see what 's being produced in the West that might not be available from East Coast sources . Stock items might include sheets of simulated bricks , moldings , doors , mantels , roofing and even staircases . <p> Miniature hardware also is available : doorknobs , light fixtures , drawer pulls and hinges are among the dozens of useful items made . But when you find something unusual , says Taylor , it 's best to buy in quantity for future use , because you do n't know whether you 'll ever see it again . Taylor recently found strap hinges and bought a gross . He knows the difficulty of improvising , which the miniature builder is faced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Nutshell News , is full of tips from readers on how to make what ca n't be bought : clipping the heads off straight pins to make nails ; using coffee stir sticks for flooring ; making old Christmas tree lights into wine bottles ; using plastic pop-on beads for lamp globes . <p> But building is only one of the joys of miniature houses , Taylor discovered : You also get to furnish them . Here the possibilities are endless . Available in standard 1:12 scale ( 1 inch to 1 foot full size ) is a vast array of manufactured furniture ; limited editions of handcrafted copies of museum pieces ; and all the accessories appropriate to a well-appointed house  --  including Christmas decorations . If a desired item is n't available from a dealer , a craftsman can be commissioned to produce it . <p> For Shadows on the Tesh Taylor chose handcrafted , limited-edition Victorian Empire . " It 's that awful stuff you see all over New Orleans , " he says . Instead of trying to replicate the furnishings of the original Shadows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what homeowner wants his house to look like a museum ? <p> " It 's furnished a whole lot better than the real Shadows , " observed a friend from Louisiana who has labored over the years raising money to furnish the real house as it might have been when its original owner lived there . <p> Like houses you live in , miniature houses are never really finished , says Taylor . There 's always redecorating , rearranging and replacing furnishings with something better . But when his Shadows on the Tesh was finished enough to please him , he started to build his next house : an elaborate Victorian based on miniature architectural drawings he purchased . Excellent Victorian pieces were plentiful at the time , so it seemed the sensible thing to do , rather than choose a style like period French , which has become readily available only recently . <p> Next , in a New York antiques shop he bought a birdhouse in the form of a French chateau , which he converted into a proper house . It still has a hatch in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another lucky day he found in an antiques store an 1864 doll house , which the toy 's manufacturer called General Grant 's house . The original moldings and mantels are intact . When Taylor was giving a friend who owns an insurance agency a tour of this house , he was told that a full-size version could n't be insured today because the chimneys are designed wrong . But that 's another joy of miniature building : These houses do n't need a homeowner 's policy . <p> In a departure from his first three houses , Taylor decided to decorate Grant 's house , as befits the modesty of a war hero and public servant , in manufactured instead of costly handcrafted pieces . He wanted one house to stand as a historical record of the quality of manufactured miniature furniture at this point in the 20th century . By now Taylor realized that his hobby was more than amusement ; he was developing a museum-quality collection . <p> After Grant 's house , Taylor ca n't remember in what order he bought or built his houses . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an antique church reliquary transformed into a French Second Empire salon ; a mirrored and gilt room once used to display jewelry in a Cartier window ; an opulent antebellum Tara where portraits of Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler hang ; an antique church , which is now out being fitted for stained glass windows ; a replica of a room designed by the 18th-century British architect Robert Adam ; and the 1750 house where Taylor lives , Glen Burnie . Taylor built that miniature himself and furnished it exactly like the big house , from the grand piano down to the microwave oven . <p> With Glen Burnie Taylor 's hobby reached a new plateau : Instead of shopping at shows , he had to commission individual craft artists to reproduce his house 's fine 18th-century furniture from the photos and measurements Taylor sent them . <p> Working with the skill and precision of a jeweler , these woodworkers use tools designed especially for building miniatures : table saws with 3/4-inch blades and regular saws with blades as narrow as 1/16 inch . Some crafters supplement their tool sets with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own . The woods they use may not be the same as those in the originals because large-grained woods such as mahogany do n't look right on a small piece . Charles Krug , who has made many of the Glen Burnie miniatures , often uses cherry because it 's dense and finely grained . He then simulates mahogany and other woods using stains . <p> Krug makes dovetailed joints for drawers , but otherwise joins pieces with glue . With miniatures there 's no concern that overweight guests or romping children might collapse a piece . <p> Stock hardware for furniture is available . But when Furd Sobol needed pulls for his copy of the Glen Burnie Hepplewhite secretary , he went to Peter Acquisto , a former jewelry maker who specializes in casting silver  --  miniature flatware , tea sets and candleholders . He asked Acquisto to cast acorn-shaped pulls from a model he carved less than one-tenth ( 0.07 ) of an inch in diameter . Acquisto cast them in 18-karat gold since he does n't work in brass . One advantage : Taylor does n't have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than two-tenths ( 0.19 ) inch wide , and the finials , at .048 to .128 inch in diameter , are the ones Taylor was advised never to touch . In making these very slender pieces , Sobol breaks dozens before he has two he can use . This raises the price of a piece to several times what it would cost to build the same thing full size . On the bright side , The cost of materials is low : It 's hard to run up much of a bill on a few board inches of lumber . <p> But even with the furniture in place , only half the job is done ; a well-appointed house needs accessories . Again , Taylor knows who is best at making chandeliers , copying paintings and hand-painted wallpaper , crocheting place mats , blowing glass goblets , casting silver flatware and reproducing books . Taylor makes his own needlepoint rugs . <p> Taylor plans to make his collection available to the public someday , but for now he 's satisfied to share it with friends , taking individual pieces from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and amazing them with the wonders of his one-twelfth-scale world . <p> After he takes a group on a tour of his houses , each piece of furniture is returned to its place . Side panels removed for viewing are put back , and if a picture or mirror is askew a little glue on the back takes care of the problem . <p> " Now , wait while I make sure all the lights are out , " he says , and takes one final turn past the houses . Even at 1:12 , light bulbs and Christmas tree lights are n't cheap .
