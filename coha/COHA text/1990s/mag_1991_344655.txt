One day a long time ago , a young man bundled himself up in a weatherproof leather coat , shouldered a crude wooden backpack , grabbed a knife , a bow and an ax , and headed into the Tyrolean Alps , which run between Austria and Italy . Up high in the mountains , at about 3,200 m ( 10,500 ft. ) , something happened  --  an accident , a violent blow  --  that took his life and left him to be swallowed by the Similaun Glacier . There he lay , locked in a crevasse , buried , frozen , forgotten . <P> Now , 4,000 years later , he has turned up  --  virtually intact and remarkably well preserved  --  a messenger from the ancient past . Stumbled upon at the glacier 's edge by a pair of German climbers , the mummified corpse was identified last week as a rare human specimen from the early Bronze Age , possibly the oldest ever found in Europe . Although hundreds of Bronze and Iron Age bodies have been found in the bogs of northwest Europe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was dubbed by the Austrian press , is much better preserved . It was a find of " extraordinary scientific significance , " says Professor Konrad Spindler at the University of Innsbruck , where the Iceman was flown for detailed study . <P> The discovery gives a glimpse into a murky period of European history . In the Bronze Age , central Europe was a relatively primitive place compared with the kingdoms of Egypt and the great city-states of Mesopotamia . The land was populated largely by preliterate farmers , living in small communities , who supported themselves with mixed agriculture and hunting . Without any written records , scientists trying to draw a picture of the ancient Europeans have had to rely on what they could discover from excavations . " We have lots of cemeteries and lots of settlements , " says Peter Wells , director of the Center for Ancient Studies at the University of Minnesota . " But rarely do we get a glimpse of actual people using their artifacts in everyday life . " <P> In that respect , the Iceman has already yielded a trove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , about 160 cm ( 5 ft. 3 in. ) tall , with tattoos in the shape of crosses and lines . The wear on his teeth suggests a diet of meat and stone-ground meal . ( An analysis of his stomach contents may yield more information about his eating habits . ) Well equipped for an Alpine trip , he wore a jacket of tanned leather stitched together with fine thongs . His leather boots were lined with hay to keep out the winter chill . <P> What was he doing in the mountains ? He was probably not a hunter , since most of the deer , badgers and wild pigs would have been found in forests at lower altitudes . He may have been searching for gold and other precious metals . He could have been on the run , hiding from enemies in the treacherous mountain passes . Or , says Spindler , he may simply have been on his way to visit a friend in the next valley  --  a trip disastrous for him but lucky for scientists 40 centuries in the future .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
