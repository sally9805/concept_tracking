There will always be something mythic about the travails and rescue of Scott O'Grady in Bosnia , but the facts emerging concern the explanations for how he came to be shot down , and they tend to be less uplifting . As the accompanying story reports , Slobodan Milosevic claims to have tried to help make sure O'Grady was returned alive . Pentagon officials assert something quite different : that were it not for Milosevic , no missile would have destroyed O'Grady 's F-16 in the first place . <P> U.S. intelligence officials tell TIME that the Bosnian Serbs ' air defenses are supported by staff and equipment in Belgrade with Milosevic 's approval . The officials also say this network is so sophisticated that the Bosnian Serbs probably knew which American pilots were flying when they shot down O'Grady on June 2 . The Bosnian Serb antiaircraft batteries , whose communications U.S. intelligence has been monitoring , may have intentionally targeted O'Grady and his wingman , Captain Bob Wright , because the two had taken part in NATO air attacks on Bosnian Serb military targets . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says a Pentagon official , referring to the call signs for O'Grady and Wright . " We think they specifically wanted to take these planes out . " <P> Even so , the shootdown might have been stymied . A secret Pentagon investigative report on the O'Grady incident , which will be reviewed in Congress this week , will fault U.S. intelligence snafus  --  and may also criticize the Marines for allowing glory-hungry senior officers to go along on the rescue . At least four hours before the downing , U.S. spy organizations had solid intelligence from signal intercepts that surface-to-air missile sites were in the area O'Grady was flying over , but that information never got to his squadron . Three minutes before the shootdown , the National Security Agency knew sam radars were tracking O'Grady 's F-16 , but an allied command plane lacking key U.S. communications gear was unable to send him the warning . <P> Radar-jamming planes now fly with NATO air patrols over Bosnia , and pilots take evasive maneuvers to avoid being fired upon . But to eliminate the threat , nato planes would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alliance is not prepared to take . As long as the air defenses are allowed to operate , the nato allies should brace themselves for more pilots being shot down .
