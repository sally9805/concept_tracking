When USA Today first appeared in 1982 , many customers eagerly seized the paper 's statistics-laden sports section and chucked the rest into the trash . Within the past year , after losing some $800 million , the Gannett daily finally became profitable . But starting this week it will face competition for the sports nut : the National , the first U.S. all-sports daily . The paper , to be published every day but Saturday , will feature 32 to 48 pages of news , opinion and gossip , with up to half the pages in color . Satellites will enable the National to cover late games , while Dow Jones , parent of the Wall Street Journal , will provide a proven distribution system . <P> The National will be overseen by Frank Deford , a former SPORTS ILLUSTRATED writer and NBC commentator who was six times named sportswriter of the year . Deford , who has not edited a publication since his days at Princeton , says he will write a column after the start-up , and regards managing editor Van McKenzie as day-to-day chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ celebrity writer : by dangling salaries reportedly ranging up to $250,000 , the National has gathered a 130-member editorial staff that includes columnists Mike Lupica from the New York Daily News and Dave Kindred from the Atlanta Journal-Constitution , as well as editors from the Boston Globe and Fort Worth Star-Telegram . Boasts Deford : " We will offer the finest collection of writers ever assembled at one daily . " <P> Despite the literary aspirations of those big names , the trend in sports coverage almost everywhere is away from elegant prose and toward number crunching : in sports , there is a statistic for practically everything . The message has not been lost on the National . Says columnist Kindred : " We hope to have pretty writing . We also hope to have every ugly box score you have ever seen . " The paper will offer localized editions wherever it is sold  --  for starters in New York City , Chicago and Los Angeles . After a gradual five-year expansion , seemingly modeled on that of USA Today , it plans to publish a separate edition in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basketball , football or hockey . <P> While sports dailies thrive in other nations , including France and Italy , they tend to stress facts and figures rather than slick writing . The National , on the other hand , presents itself as a literate journal aiming at young , well-off college graduates , presumably male . Some 1,200 pages of ads have been sold for the first year , 20% above initial projections , thanks in large part to Deford 's credibility , which he has exploited by pitching to potential advertisers in person . Says Drew Marcus , an analyst at Kidder Peabody : " The paper is going after a very narrow niche , but one with a possibility of success . " <P> The National is financed by Mexican media tycoon Emilio Azcarraga Milmo , who dominates his country 's TV production . He also counts a pro soccer team among an estimated $1 billion in holdings . The new daily 's publisher , Peter Price , erstwhile publisher of the New York Post , says the start-up cost $25 million and predicts losses of only $100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should break even , at a circulation of 750,000 a day , within two years . USA Today president Tom Curley is skeptical . Says he : " $100 million does n't square with our experience . "
