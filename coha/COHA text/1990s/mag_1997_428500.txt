Section : News Of The Week Global Warming In Kyoto , the world takes a historic first step toward turning down the heat . But can the deal really work ? <p> AL GORE HAD JUST SAT DOWN to cold cereal and mixed fruit with the chief American negotiator at the climate-change conference in Kyoto , Japan , last week . The international meeting was stalemated . Poor countries were convinced that the United States was leading a cabal to deny them the right to develop economically . Environmentalists were fuming that a lawyer from one of Washington 's most-wired firms was trying , on behalf of American industry , to torpedo a deal by advising countries like India and China not to give an inch to any U.S. demands . It looked like Gore 's pet cause , reining in the greenhouse gases that trap heat in the atmosphere and thus threaten to change the planet 's climate , was in deep trouble . So after being on the phone with White House aides throughout the 18-hour flight on Air Force Two , the vice president " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extra mile , " Stuart Eizenstat , under secretary of state and head of the U.S. delegation , told NEWSWEEK . Less than an hour before he spoke , Gore typed a new passage into his laptop . Then , before 2,200 government officials and 8,000 observers , lobbyists and reporters , he strode to the podium . " I am instructing our delegation right now , " Gore said , " to show increased negotiating flexibility . " <p> While to ordinary ears that may not sound like a rousing call to arms , in diplo-speak it meant Gore , and Clinton , were determined to get a deal in Kyoto . Gore 's transpacific flight had spewed out tons of the chief man-made greenhouse gas , carbon dioxide ( a car emits about 20 pounds for every gallon of gas it burns ) , but what 's a little pollution when you can help save the planet ? Two days after Gore 's speech , on the day after the conference was scheduled to end-with the official interpreters gone , the heat turned off in the press gallery and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 159 nations agreed to a pact that takes the first , historic steps toward legally binding reductions in the industrial gases that threaten to dramatically , and possibly disastrously , change the planet 's climate . But as Clinton conceded , " There are still hard challenges ahead . " <p> That was an understatement . Under the Kyoto Protocol , the European Union would reduce its emissions of six greenhouse gases 8 percent below what they were in 1990 . Japan would reduce to 6 percent below 1990 levels ( a 2 a.m. phone call from Gore to Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto got Japan to budge from its 5 percent offer ) . The United States , the biggest greenhouse polluter , pledged a 7 percent reduction below 1990 . According to the Department of Energy , that would mean emitting 550 million metric tons less carbon by 2012 than we otherwise would-a 30 percent cut . It would be achieved largely by burning less coal , oil and natural gas . These fossil fuels produce carbon dioxide-but they also power virtually all economic activity . Opponents therefore warned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advertising campaign , that reducing greenhouse gases by burning less fossil fuel would send the economy into the toilet , push jobs overseas , force drivers out of their Range Rovers and basically condemn Americans to drinking warm beer in a cold house . As Sen. Chuck Hagel of Nebraska declared , " We will kill this bill . " <p> But it is n't a bill . Congress does not have the power to bring it to the floor for a quick death . Instead , a president sends a treaty to the Senate for ratification . Late last week Clinton announced that he would not submit the treaty until 1999 at the earliest , and not until after he had wrung from developing countries a pledge to limit their own greenhouse gases . Even Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts , who supports greenhouse cuts , called the pact " not yet ratifiable by the U.S. Senate because of the lack of meaningful participation by developing countries . " The fear is that if America 's competitors do n't have to meet the Kyoto goals , industries will move plants-and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the American Petroleum Institute , " represents unilateral economic disarmament . " <p> Get set for a bruising debate that could make the " Harry and Louise " ads attacking Clinton 's health-care plan look mild . Already the coal , oil , auto and other big industries have paid for studies concluding that greenhouse cuts would raise gasoline prices 44 cents a gallon , increase electric bills 48 percent and push up the cost of home heating oil 55 percent . Green groups are reminding voters that these were the same businesses that warned that controlling the gases that cause acid rain would cost $350 to $1,000 a ton , whereas in fact it costs $62 to $170 . " Every time we 've tried to improve the American environment in the last 25 or 30 years , " Clinton said in an opening salvo , " somebody has predicted that it would wreck the economy . " <p> The administration does n't think greenhouse reductions will do any such thing , and there are steps it can take to bring about the cuts with no help from Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like wind and solar . ( Such grants have brought down the cost of wind power from 40 cents per kilowatt hour in 1980 to 5 cents today , competitive with fossil fuel . ) And under existing law , the administration can tighten energy-efficiency standards for home appliances . Refrigerators that draw less electricity , for instance , would cause the emission ( from power plants ) of 12 million fewer tons of carbon in 2010 . The efficient fridge would cost about $80 more , which the consumer would get back in electricity savings over two or so years . Improving the efficiency of other appliances , as well as buildings , would save up to 60 million tons of carbon , calculates physicist Joseph Romm of the Department of Energy . The technologies to achieve these small steps , and others , all exist today ( chart ) . The White House hopes to speed their adoption by requiring all federal agencies to reduce energy consumption and buy only efficient machinery . <p> There is no question , though , that achieving the Kyoto greenhouse cuts would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is preparing a $5 billion package of tax cuts , credits and research grants to bring down greenhouse emissions , but the bill would require congressional approval . Listening to the fury on Capitol Hill-Speaker Newt Gingrich called the Kyoto pact " an outrage , " and Sen. James Inhofe of Oklahoma described it as " a political , economic and national-security fiasco " - that seemed like a long shot . But things will get interesting when the GOP 's opposition runs headlong into causes that it holds dear . Like tax reductions . A car that gets 40 mpg rather than the current industry average of 27 would cost an extra $1,000 to $2,000 ; with a tax credit for fuel-efficient cars , a buyer could get all or some of the extra back on April 15 . In fact , the Ford Motor Co. says it can build a van that gets 32 miles per gallon-more than twice its Econoline 's mileage-at no additional cost ; Toyota is about to roll out a 66-mpg Corolla-size car . <p> Another opening for greenhouse savings could come as early as next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The industry is drooling over the prospect of competing for customers anywhere in the country ( much as long-distance phone companies do ) . In return , the administration is planning ways to get utilities to agree to greenhouse cuts . One easy fix would be to run power plants more efficiently : the industry average is 34 percent , but the best plants are 55 percent efficient . Minimizing shutdowns , says Tom Natan of the National Environmental Trust , could increase efficiency at no cost to consumers and with no new technology . Another possibility : require utilities to tell customers how they generate power . That way , people who wanted to support , say , wind energy and did n't mind paying 5 to 10 percent more to feel virtuous could do so . Even natural-gas-fired utilities produce less carbon than those fueled by coal or oil . Might there be any takers ? " The people are ahead of the politicians on this one , " says Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut . In a NEWSWEEK Poll , 82 percent of those responding said they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay more for a high-mpg car . <p> America 's Kyoto burden may in fact be less onerous than it seems . For one thing , the United States could reduce the 7 percent it has to cut greenhouse emissions by 2 of those percentage points through planting trees , which suck up carbon . Also , the cuts do n't all have to come from carbon dioxide . The United States insisted that five other greenhouse gases , which are arguably easier to cut , count toward the goal . Another way for the United States to reduce its emissions would be to buy its way out of part of its Kyoto pledge . Russia , for instance , is emitting way less greenhouse gases than it was in 1990 . The United States could buy Russia 's unused greenhouse allowance , slicing as much as 160 million tons off its own obligation of 550 million . China and India tried to kill such " emissions trading , " so the Kyoto delegates left the details for the next climate-change meeting , in November 1998 in Buenos Aires . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by investing in greenhouse-friendly projects overseas-say , by selling energy-efficient factories to China . " This will enhance our growth and create new opportunities for technology , " said Eizenstat , especially in exports and high-tech industries . <p> The Kyoto Protocol will be available for signing for one year , beginning next March . Once a country signs , it has a year to ratify . The administration hopes to pick up Senate support in two ways . First , it is counting on voters to embrace greenhouse cuts . ( In the NEWSWEEK Poll , 63 percent said the cuts could be made without hurting the economy . ) Second , it is banking on its arm-twisting to get wealthier developing countries , like Brazil , China and India , to commit to limiting their own greenhouse gases . The developing world accounts for less than 25 percent of the greenhouse gases emitted since the Industrial Revolution , but its emissions will surpass those of Europe , Japan and the United States by 2030 . Even if the United States signs and ratifies the Kyoto Protocol , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slower rate . Some climate change is therefore just about inevitable . What the Kyoto pact does is take a small , though historic , first step toward turning down the heat . Closing the Gap : What Kyoto Could Mean To You <p> The new international accord would require drastic cuts in greenhouse gases-especially carbon dioxide-in just 15 years . How the United States might be able to start chipping away : Carbon-dioxide emissions in the United States <p> The rate of CO(sub2) emission is expected to soar unless the treaty is ratified and observed .

How the treaty could affect a family 's monthly expenses : TABLE <p> * 1996 dollars , projected . Sources : Energy Information Administration : WEFA , Inc. , Newsweek Research ; Dept. of Energy Big savings from small steps <p> Critics of the Kyoto pact worry that a pollution tax will be the only way to reduce emissions . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in energy effiency could make a big difference : Transportation <p> Use new technology to get better gas mileage in cars and trucks ; even inflating tires properly helps . Emissions cut : 50 million to 60 million metric tons per year . Household energy <p> Increase effeciency of major appliances ; insulate buildings to use less energy for heating . Emsiions cut : 30 million to 50 million metric tons . Appliance circuitry <p> Install circuits in TVs , VCRs and electric toobrushes so they do n't draw power in standby mode . Emissions cut : 8 million to 10 million metric tons . Utilities <p> Reroute heat from electric utilities that would otherwise go to waste into nearby factories and buildings . Emissions cut : 20 million to 30 million metric tons . Coal and fuels <p> Replace 3% to 5% of the fuel consumed in coal-burning power plants with paper and crop waste . Emissions cut : 15 million to 25 million metric tons . Wind power <p> Install high-effiency wind turbines ( where it makes economic sense ) in Calif. , Texas and the Dakotas .
