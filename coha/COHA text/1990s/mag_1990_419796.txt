How the master of leveraged buyout deals got his way in Washington  --  and set the stage for his own fall . <p> IF THE NARCOTIC OF CHOICE FOR INvestment bankers is doing deals , then Henry Kravis is Wall Street 's biggest junkie . <p> Kravis lives and breathes for the big deal , the one that sucks the air out of competitors and detractors . Time stops for a moment when a big deal is consummated , the corporate landscape is forever changed , and fortunes are made . In less than a decade , the forty-five-year-old Kravis has parlayed a financing technique known as the leveraged buyout ( LBO ) into a holding-company empire that surpasses General Electric in size . He also ostentatiously presides over a personal fortune estimated ( conservatively ) at $330 million . That beats the rush from any nonprescription drug . <p> The story of Henry Kravis is a quintessential tale from an era whose central theme , we do n't need media sociologists to tell us , is greed . It 's about insatiable avarice on Wall Street , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off to foreign buyers , and , finally , how great financial interests ward off Washington . For after he used leverage to conquer Wall Street , Kravis successfully applied the same principle to Washington  --  except this time , the return on his investment did not yield controlling interest in a corporation , but privileged access for his views , and immunity from close scrutiny of his acts . Kravis procured political inaction . <p> Even as Kravis tries to keep America safe for deals , though , deep fissures have appeared in his empire , raising the specter of a huge bill coming due in the nineties . Months of disarray in the " junk " bond market , underscored by February 's collapse of Drexel , Burnham , Lambert Group , Inc. , the premier marketeer of highyield debt , have knocked out one big assumption upon which his empire of leverage was engineered . The market for new deals is nearly dormant . Still , because of old deals , U.S. industry as a whole is diverting more cash to debt relief than at any time since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minimum , will make corresponding cuts in the investments that yield profits , products , and jobs over the long term . And if the economy slides into a recession , all bets are off . A new , corporate debt crisis could take its place alongside the Third World and savings-and-loan debacles , bringing incalculable losses for the banks , insurance companies , and pension funds that invested in Henry Kravis 's buyouts . <p> HENRY KRAVIS 'S WALL STREET LACKS ANY SENSE OF OBLIgation to society , and its motto is " get as much as you can . " There are only two kinds of people : players and schmucks . Telling the difference is easy . Players , like Kravis himself , are not bound by the rules . Schmucks are . <p> Kravis first learned this critical distinction from his father , Raymond , a successful petroleum geologist in Tulsa , Oklahoma . The elder Kravis was a shrewd speculator and sometime partner of Kennedy-clan patriarch Joseph Kennedy . He sent young Henry to prep school and college , then off to New York in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the most radical campuses during the height of the antiwar movement scarcely affected the single-minded Kravis . " I left it to my liberal friends to do things like getting arrested , " Kravis would later recall . " I had my mind on business . " <p> Since he was Jewish , Kravis lacked the proper pedigree for a job after graduation with one of the blue-chip , WASP investment-banking firms . Instead , through his father 's connections , he latched on at the less prestigious Bear , Stearns &; Co . It was there that Kravis and his first cousin and colleague George Roberts met taciturn corporate financier Jerome Kohlberg , Jr. ; together , these men would eventually turn wood-paneled Wall Street upside down . <p> The three shared a passion for a then-obscure corporate finance technique known as a leveraged buyout . In a typical corporate LBO , a small group of investors buys up all the stock of a publicly traded corporation . They put about 10 percent down , and the rest of the purchase price is raised through high-interest loans from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a home mortgage , the interest on this debt is wholly deductible . So a leveraged company will often pay virtually no corporate income taxes immediately after a buyout , a margin that is critical to servicing its debt . In fact , some buyouts in the past have received tax refunds , courtesy of the U.S. Treasury . One essential element , however , makes LBOs risky business . After a corporation is leveraged , there is no independent source of income  --  like , say , a new homeowner 's wage earnings  --  to pay off the mortgage ; instead , the earnings of the " new " corporate entity itself are used to make the payments . This puts a heavily leveraged company on a razor 's edge until its debt is paid down . Competition in the marketplace , a slowdown in the economy , or anything else that disturbs earnings , can push the entire corporation into bankruptcy , or force it to sell off valuable assets to meet debt payments . But if a leveraged corporation survives the three to five years it takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) debt , investors who put only 10 percent down own the entire corporation and can put it back on the stock market , at as much as twenty or thirty times their original investment . <p> In 1976 , Kohlberg , Kravis , and Roberts ventured forth on their own to show the world what an LBO could do . With missionary zeal , a Garbo-like penchant for secrecy , just $120,000 in capital , and the barest-of-barebones offices , the new " boutique " firm of Kohlberg , Kravis , Roberts &; Co. opened inauspiciously . Kohlberg 's good name , and almost legendary caution and reserve , gave ballast and credibility to the new firm . For his part , Kravis , short , intense , and volatile , was the consummate and welt-tailored salesman ; he had a knack for striding into a meeting with staid money managers and striking the perfect note of urbanity , briskness , and confidence . Consequently , he often got the " doggiest " sales jobs , that is , making the rounds of the pension funds , banks , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in KKR . It was a hard sell , for most of corporate America still considered LBOs to be immoral , and investors knew it . <p> In 1979 , though , KKR engineered a deal that " broke the sound barrier , " as one investment banker later put it . The partners , using an intricate network that included two newly created holding companies and a staggering array of banks , insurance companies , and state pension funds , captured control of Houdaille Industries , a conglomerate worth almost $400 million , while contributing just over $1 million of their own funds . " The public documents on that deal were grabbed up by every firm on Wall Street , " said one investment banker . " KKR showed everybody what could really be done . We all said , ' Holy mackerel , look at this ! ' " <p> KKR mounted the Securities and Exchange Commission registration statements from the Houdaille buyout in a lucite frame . It was the corporate equivalent of big-game hunting , and there would be many more stuffed trophies during the 1980s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imaginative outsiders , notably Michael Milken , master of the high-interest junk bond , and Ivan Boesky , whose speculative buying put corporations " into play " overnight . ( Several KKR buyouts , in fact , would become the object of Boesky-related insider-trading investigations by the SEC . ) Together with haphazard deregulation , all these elements spawned the laissez-faire Reagan era , as rampant speculation replaced enterprise . <p> The price of speculation was paid most often by the most vulnerable variable in the equation  --  labor . At Houdaille , KKR forecast a whopping 44 percent increase in net income within a year of the buyout . To make economic forecasts pan out , slash-and-burn management decisions inexorably followed . In 1980 , the KKR-owned conglomerate decided to close down a modem production facility in Canada and notified the two-hundred-plus work force that it would not meet its originally contracted pension , severance , or medical-benefits obligations . It took a two-week sit-in by workers , the first strike at the plant since 1948 , and government mediation before Houdaille agreed to fulfill contractual obligations . <p> This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , KKR leveraged Amstar , the nation 's largest manufacturer of sweeteners . Three thousand workers were laid off within six to nine months . Through it all , KKR exhibited an uncanny knack for making worker concessions and asset sales highly profitable for its investors , which , in a bitter irony , began to include many workers ' pension funds . The Oregon Public Employees Retirement System , for example , invested $4 million in the Amstar LBO and was paid back $18.3 million three years later . Such returns have made LBOs " the best-performing asset class we have , " according to Oregon 's investment manager James George . But George professed ignorance about the cost to labor of the Amstar buyout . " I do n't know about those allegations , and do n't know why anyone in Oregon would , " George said . <p> During the early to middle eighties , KKR alone was responsible for engineering more than two dozen buyouts worth just under $14 billion , including one deal of truly mammoth proportions : In 1986 , with an unprecedented dose of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conglomerate went private for $8.2 billion . KKR 's fee for just arranging that deal came to $45 million , then the largest single transaction fee ever . " I do n't think the fees were excessive given the new ground we were breaking , " observed Kravis . <p> In the process of leveraging corporate America , the KKR partners became extraordinarily wealthy . In 1985 , Kravis moved into a $5.5 million , sixteen-room , two-fireplace , Park Avenue apartment in a building that was once the home of John D. Rockefeller , Jr . Around the same time , he divorced his first wife and married a former Young Republican named Carolyne Roehm , an ectomorphic thirty-four-year-old designer who fashioned dresses averaging $6,000 each . Kravis and Roehm became the quintessential Bonfire of the Vanities couple : King Henry , master of the universe , and Carolyne , a person , according to some who know her , who defines the word vapid . The couple became mainstays of Manhattan society columns ; Kravis personally donated $10 million to help the Metropolitan Museum of Art complete its master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manhattan : the new addition was to be named the Henry R. Kravis Wing . <p> Inside KKR , the story was altogether different . Intractable tensions were growing between the elder statesman Kohlberg and his proteges . Kravis 's pretentious life-style bothered the relatively austere Kohlberg ( who merely owned an estate in Westchester County and played a lot of tennis ) . More importantly , the three men were increasingly at odds over the burgeoning size of LBOs , the competitive bidding that marked the deals now being done , and the increasingly baroque forms of junk financing that were needed to do a deal . Back in 1979 , KKR more or less had the buyout field to itself . But by 1983 , everyone on Wall Street wanted to do LBOs and mint money . Inexorably , this competition forced KKR to innovate and consider deals that would have once been dismissed out of baud And the serendipitous , but not coincidental , rise of Drexd 's junk bond factory , headed by Michael Milken , made virtually any financial engineering possible . <p> In 1984 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours and duties were strictly limited . Kravis and Roberts had a chance to stretch their wings , and they were n't about to be recaged . Kravis and Roberts also felt that Kohlberg no longer pulled his weight in a business starkly transformed . After a particularly divisive struggle over the buyout of Owens-Illinois , the trio decided that their differences over operating philosophy , money , and power were too great . Kohlberg announced his resignation to a select audience of KKR 's investors , using the occasion , in May 1987 , to decry the &dine; of Wall Street ethics and the " overpowering greed that pervades our business life . " Without a resurgence of values , Kohlberg warned , " We will kill the golden goose . " He intended to continue doing deals in a new partnership with his son James . But " I 'll stick with deals where reason still prevails , " said Kohlberg . <p> Five months after Kohlberg 's farewell address , Black Monday made him look like a prophet . October 19 , 1987 , saw the biggest one-day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the junk bond market would shrink significantly , dampening the takeover and buyout frenzy . Kravis , however , was more concerned with the effect of the crash on the Hill than on the Street . He knew that as long as deregulation reigned , the stock exchange would right itself over the next few months . But if the crash became a big issue during the upcoming presidential campaign , it could help elect a Democrat , who would presumably threaten the laissez-faire environment for buyouts . <p> For Kravis , another kind of big investment was in order  --  an investment in politics . He had regularly given substantial sums to key politicians and especially the Republican party : from 1979 to 1986 , Kravis 's political contributions totaled nearly $100,000 , sufficient to put him on a first-name basis with some senators . But what Kravis envisioned now was a role of an altogether different magnitude . He signed on as finance cochairman of the New York Bush for President Campaign and began raising millions for his favorite cause : the unfettered market for corporate control . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the key organizer of a Manhattan fund-raiser for George Bush . The luncheon at Wall Street 's Vista Hotel netted the fledgling campaign $550,000 with the promise of much more to come . In addition , Kravis funneled $12,000 directly to Bush and $152,000 to an assortment of Republican campaign committees , while Carolyne Roehm chipped in $17,000 . The message was clear . Although public-opinion polls revealed widespread skepticism about Wall Street 's financial engineering , Bush , whenever pressed , uttered the code words that Wall Street was listening for . There would be no " turning back the clock to the malaise days " and government regulation , Bush told a Manhattan audience during the campaign . He favored a " free-market " approach to takeovers and buyouts . <p> EVERYTHING WAS GOING SMOOTHLY  --  BUSH WAS FLYING high in the polls , and the market was inching its way back up  --  until mid-October 1988 . Then E Ross Johnson , CEO of the RJR Nabisco corporation , dropped a bombshell . In concert with senior management , he proposed taking the nineteenth-largest corporation in the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was taken aback . Almost a year earlier , he had invited Johnson to an intimate dinner at his apartment to discuss a buyout of RJR . But now , Johnson was locking Kravis out of the deal of deals . Vowing to protect KKR 's " franchise , " Kravis decided to submit a competing bid . The unseemly battle that followed uncorked a flood of public criticism  --  so much , in fact , that even before winning the bidding with a $25 billion offer , Kravis tried to put a friendly public face on the secretive KKR . " Greed really turns me off , " he would tell Fortune in a carefully scripted interview . " To me , money means security . " <p> In spite of this sudden attempt at spin control , a few prominent administration policymakers-to-be , including WASPish Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady , an old Wall Street hand himself , looked askance at the explosion in corporate indebtedness . Still , the new president was not likely to bite the hand that had passed along so many checks . Little more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administration 's position on LBOs : Treasury would monitor the situation . The substitution of corporate debt for equity left Brady with a " gnawing feeling . " Said the treasury secretary : " You do n't see convulsions of restructuring in West Germany , Japan , Taiwan , Korea , and our other major competitors . They are putting their assets to work . " Still , the Bush administration 's basic philosophy was to let market forces work their will . <p> The lack of decisive presidential leadership may have struck a fatal blow to any prospects for immediate reform , but the Democratic-controlled Congress remained problematic for Kravis 's kingdom . By the end of 1988 , no fewer than nine separate House and Senate committees had announced hearings into leveraged buyouts , specifically including Kravis 's RJR deal . The committees ranged from such powerhouse panels as the House Energy and Commerce Committee , chaired by Congressman John Dingell , to the relatively obscure Senate Banking Subcommittee on Securities , led by Senator Chris Dodd . <p> The last thing Kravis wanted to do , though , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dismembered in 1987 to pay off its debt , or how Marley Company , a respected Kansas manufacturer , was forced to slash its work force in half after a 1982 LBO . Rather , he wanted private audiences and legislators ' undivided attention , so he could personally show why buyouts were an elixir for corporate America . <p> Kravis invited several Congress members and staffers for meals in his palatial offices . While a phalanx of waiters attended to his guests , he held forth on corporate America 's flabbiness . According to a guest who asked not to be named , Kravis 's standard refrain was the same as that of his public speeches : " gridlocked corporations are dragging the U.S. economy down the drain , " and LBOs " free U.S. business from the paralyzing clutches of hidebound corporate bureaucracies . " The biggest obstacle in his selfless but lucrative quest to make America more competitive , Kravis asserted , was labor . " Most of the problems buyouts have are with unions , " he candidly said . <p> Throughout the winter of 1988 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successfully as he once cultivated pension-fund managers with millions to invest . He visited nearly every member of the Senate Finance and Banking panels , and a score of members in the House . " He does n't come off as a robber baron , " said Congressman Charles Schumer ( D-NY ) , a key House opinion leader on corporate issues , after meeting Kravis . " He comes off as a nice , courtly gentleman . " <p> Kravis hired five separate law and lobbying firms to help him curry congressional favor . Perhaps the most valuable was Wunder &; Diefenderfer . William Diefenderfer  --  who left his firm last year to become deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget  --  was the former staff director of the all-important Senate Finance Committee in the mid-1980s . And , most significantly , he had magnificent access to one senator in particular , his former boss , Republican Bob Packwood . <p> Articulate , intelligent , and liberal on social issues , Packwood is the Republicans ' heavy hitter on the Senate Finance Committee . His official position on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're not sure there is a problem , or if so , how to fix it . " But this seemingly open-minded stance was belied by Packwood 's comments and questions throughout three days of hearings in January 1989 . He noted how well Oregon pension funds had fared with KKR , and introduced into the record a virtual advertisement for KKR 's buyout of Fred Meyer , a retail-store chain in Oregon . It was as if one LBO ( and an unrepresentative one at that ) justified the buyout binge . <p> Packwood packaged his viewpoint as if it had been solely informed by his state 's lucrative experience with KKR , and his staff claimed that " labor did n't have anything to back up what they were saying . " In truth , his stance reflected an equally keen appreciation of Kravis 's role in financing the Republican party and senatorial campaigns . As one former Senate investigator noted at a hearing , " It 's tough to take their money , and then cut off their balls the next day . " <p> Republicans were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least , he had to neutralize the Democratic side of the aisle , especially in the House , where antibuyout sentiment ran strongest . Here again , he would turn to Wunder &; Diefenderfer , whose ties to liberal Democrats easily rivaled its links to Republicans . Ken Levine , a former Carter administration appointee ; Michael Forscey , a onetime member of Senator Edward Kennedy 's staff ; and Tom Ryan , former chief counsel for Congressman John Dingell , all worked at the firm . Forscey and Levine , moreover , have been involved with Independent Action , one of the largest Washington-based PACs dedicated to supporting progressive Democrats . <p> Through these hired channels , Kravis contacted Democrats like Congressman Tom Downey ( NY ) , one of the most thoughtful and energetic Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee . Downey had met Kravis several times , and Kravis knew that the congressman persistently criticized the existing , often lethargic corporate structure . Kravis presented himself as a plausible antidote to corpocracy , and Downey gave Kravis some lobbying advice . " I did not walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but " I gave him a list of people on Ways and Means who are effective and intelligent , and told him he should contact them if he wanted to make his case . " Downey even called some colleagues , like buyout critic Congressman Byron Dorgan , to ask them to hear Kravis ( Jut . Kravis , Roberts , and a third KKR partner subsequently contributed $1,500 to Downey 's campaign treasury . <p> What made Kravis 's lobbying especially effective was a study that KKR itself commissioned . It showed uniformly positive results from the LBOs engineered by the firm , and claimed increases in employment , profits , and taxes paid to the federal government . The study did n't always work . When Kravis went in to see Democratic senator Max Baucus and urged him to read the KKR study , Baucus pointedly refused . Since KKR paid for it , the senator was heard to remark , " I already know what it says . " But many other members , and staffers , were snookered . The report 's claims , numbers , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presented the report that , virtually overnight , congressional sentiment shifted from " LBOs have gotten out of hand " to " Let 's not make the cure worse than the disease , if there is one . " <p> It was five months before KKR 's presentation was impeached . A former Federal Trade Commission economist , William Long , in testimony before Congressman Ed Markey 's subcommittee on finance , showed in painstaking detail how KKR had cooked the books to shed the most flattering light on its buyouts . Long showed that KKR 's conclusions were premature , if not suspect . Many of the claims , it turned out , had been based on projections rather than actual figures . But this was May . By that time , King Henry 's study had taken the Hill . <p> Of course , other elements defined the debate over LBOs , not the least of which were Congress ' notoriously short attention span and particular fear of complex financial issues . Nevertheless , Kravis 's calculated moves affected debate at a pivotal moment . In the wake of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study showed that at least some on Wall Street would not bend to popular outrage ; it also cowed Democrats afraid to be blamed for another market meltdown . The only reforms that passed in 1989  --  reforms vigorously opposed by Kravis  --  were two changes to the tax laws that affect the deductibility of some of the junkiest forms of corporate debt . <p> Congress did n't even carry through on its vow to get to the bottom of the deal of deals , the RJR buyout . Congressman John Dingell 's usually tough investigators mounted the probe amid great fanfare in December 1988 , in part because the money that was made seemed so " out-goddamnedrageous , " said chief counsel Michael Barrett . All the major players in the RJR deal were questioned for hours on end , including Kravis . His performance was so effective that Reid Stuntz , the staffer charged with drafting the initial report , took to quoting Kravis approvingly on the deal . Kravis 's claim  --  that RJR was n't a good case study  --  became the conventional wisdom , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Barrett , " we just could n't get a real good handle on the deal . " In reality , the probe was far too narrowly conceived , and the educative role of hearings all but ignored . The issue was n't simply whether board chairman Ross Johnson tried to steal RJR away by " lowballing . " The ingenious funny money Kravis devised was of at least equal importance , as was the $8 billion of tax breaks that the RJR deal hinged upon . <p> THE VERY SKILL THAT MADE HENRY Kravis , though , may eventually undo him . He scaled the heights of finance capitalism through his highly aggressive entrepreneurship , spurning prudence and the normal rules of financial conduct . Now , with the junk market " in shambles , " to use his own characterization , and amid a slowing economy , Kravis may reap a taste of what he has sown . SCI Television and Seaman Furniture recently had to reschedule their debt after missing payments , and last December , the former Jim Walter Corporation filed for bankruptcy , KKR 's first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of debt incurred from the RJR buyout . Some of the unsecured debt has plummeted in value , even though RJR bonds were initially considered next to sacrosanct by junk bond investors . And in February , RJR had to postpone a new $1.25 billion debt offering because of turmoil in the market . If interest rates remain high or rise , the company faces a " bust-up " far beyond anything contemplated when the deal was consummated . The safety net once provided by Drexel is gone , and new junk debt can not be piled upon bad junk debt any longer . <p> There are even signs , albeit faint , that Democrats may awaken from their slumber . In focus-group interviews privately conducted for the Democratic National Committee early this year , disaffected Democratic voters singled out leveraged buyouts as an abuse that needs curbing and chastised the party for doing nothing . Subsequently , House Speaker Tom Foley pointedly criticized buyout mania as " a waste of resources " in his rebuttal to Bush 's State of the Union address . Still , it 's not clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether it 's sufficient to overcome the dependence of some influential members , like Senator Bill Bradley , on Wall Street 's largess . During the last election cycle , Bradley received $96,000 from individuals linked to LBOs , and he was n't even running for anything . The Democrats ' inclination still has a decidedly facile and Republican tinge to it : let the market discipline what have admittedly been excesses . <p> Kravis has responded to the gathering clouds by lashing out at the media for its sensationalism , and by criticizing investment managers who divested junk bonds from their portfolios . At a February gathering organized in lieu of Drexel 's notorious " predator 's ball " conference , Kravis accused the money managers of following a " herd mentality " rather than acting as his long-term " partners . " It was a rare misstep for the consummate salesman of debt . Many there resented the implication that they were cowards , swept mindlessly along by a media-induced panic . " That speech may come back to haunt him , " one senior portfolio manager told the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed in exquisite detail on Wall Street and Fifth Avenue . What Germans call Schaden-freude ( taking malicious joy in a neighbor 's misfortune ) is manifest in Manhattan 's gossip columns . If King Henry loses his preferred vocation , " there 's always Carolyne 's rag business , " goes one jibe . Tom Daly , a KKR spokesman , refers to this as the " banker and banana peel " phenomenon . People delight in seeing " a successful banker slip , " he says . <p> Henry Kravis works without a net , and has never fallen . His mistake may be in thinking that it can go on like that forever . <p> ILLUSTRATION <p> By Max Holland &; Viveca Novak <p> <p> Max Holland 's book , When the Machine Stopped ( Harvard Business School Press , 1989 ) , was the first inside look at a leveraged buyout .
