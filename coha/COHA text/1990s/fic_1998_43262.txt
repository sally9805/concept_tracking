Dorrie Mangosing had always felt destined for success-if not fame and fortune , at least a view condo with off-street parking . So when she hit a wall in her career , she did n't panic . She formulated a plan . Not something kneejerk and off the cuff . But a real plan , worthy of a young woman intent upon improving her job . <p> It was not a bad job ; at least , it had n't started out that way . The problem was she had mastered her craft , all its nuances , every facet . The problem was nobody noticed . Except her mother . And that was a problem , because her mother disapproved of her job , which was putting it mildly Vivian Mangosing could not admit to her friends in Seattle what her daughter in Hollywood really did for a living . On the other hand , she could n't settle on a satisfactory fib . She told her coworkers at Greenpeace that Dorrie was a television producer , her book group that Dorrie was a screenwriter and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she would declare , a stage ornament , which was exactly what Dorrie happened to be , at least in Vivian 's eyes . <p> Dorrie was actually called an attendant . She worked the awards shows : People 's Choice , Grammys , Emmys ( daytime and prime-time ) . In the heyday of attendants , she would have been the one who , when the celebrity asked suspensefully , " May I have the envelope , please , " delivered the goods . Nowadays , though , the celebrity carried the envelope to the podium , effectively stealing the most salient of the attendant 's duties . Bereft of this trademark task of their profession , Dorrie and her colleagues made the best of their remaining duties-handing the statuette to the celebrity , standing off-camera while the celebrity presented it to the jubilant winner and escorting the jubilant winner offstage , unless , of course , the celebrity chose to usurp that task as well . <p> At first , it was enough for Dorrie-to do her job , to be appealing yet unassuming . She accepted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer tolerate was the invisibility It was no use discussing it with her mother , for whom her nonjob was a nonissue . Dorrie had given up trying to make her mother see the value of her position , given up pointing out that not only was she the only Filipina-American in the business , she was the only Asian , period . Given up pointing out that she had refused to adopt an easier-to-pronounce professional name in favor of her own inevitably mangled Filipino name , despite having to remind everyone of its correct pronunciation . Mangosing , she would say , " a " as in ah , accent on the " go . " Mango-sing , she would hear in return , like a musical fruit , as if she were a Las Vegas lounge act with a gimmicky made-up name after all . Still , it was the affirmative-action aspect she had used in trying to elicit her mother 's moral support , believing it was an argument that would appeal to her mother , of all people . <p> " I 'm a presence for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the exposure . " " Exactly , " replied her mother uncharitably . <p> " At least I never wore hot pants on stage , " was Dorrie 's retort , which she knew cut to the quick of Vivian Mangosing 's feminist core . " Polyester , " she noted , hoping to add insult to injury <p> SOME YEARS AGO , Vivian , in an attempt to bond with a rude and rebellious 15-yearold Dorrie , had shown her video footage of the local Miss Philippines beauty pageant of 1970 , in which Vivian had been a contestant . Vivian had entered the contest with the ulterior motive of gaining a forum to express her outrage at the demeaning practice of judging women by appearance . But sharing this memory did not have the inspirational , role-model effect Vivian had hoped for . Dorrie viewed the whole episode with a rather jaundiced eye , no doubt the result of the polyester hot pants the color of ripe squash that her mother sported in the second round of judging . <p> Whenever Dorrie watched Vivian on the fuzzy videotape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she always wanted to freeze the frame , as if she could prevent what had happened that evening Each of the contestants was fixed snugly inside the traditional butterfly dress , authentically made of pineapple and banana fiber , flown from Manila or the provinces to the Pacific Northwest , and each made her elegant way to the microphone to smilingly speak her name and affiliation . It was at this point that Vivian was to deliver her diatribe against beauty pageants , but apparently lost her nerve , instead shouting only her name and completely forgetting to mention her sponsor , the Ladies Auxiliary of the Beacon Hill Filipino Association , for which the ladies were afterward grateful , though the video showed a frantic Mrs. Labao , auxiliary president , cueing Vivian with stage whispers through a megaphone she had fashioned from her rolled-up program . <p> Having bungled her first opportunity at the microphone , Vivian was forced to participate in the next round of judging-the hot pants competition . And what Vivian considered her triumph , Dorrie considered a humiliation that could only be redressed with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sight of her mother being dragged from the stage by the tuxedoed emcee and Mrs. Labao . Having been arrested at extracurricular sit-ins in the dean 's office to demand Tagalog language classes , at peace marches that sent merchants on the Ave scurrying to barricade their doors and for the irresistible impulse to wrap the faux Ionic columns of the Alpha Sigma Phi house in 47 rolls of two-ply toilet tissue , Vivian knew the resistance posture : legs straight out in front of her , one arm limp , the other raised in defiance ( to reveal an unshaven armpit ) , her entire body a dead weight . All this while clad in her squash yellow hot pants and halter top . Where was the dignity in that ? <p> Dorrie knew where her own dignity lay It was in her ability to do a job well , no matter how minor , subordinate , ancillary small or superficial . But the time had come for the world to know it too . Including her mother back home in the Beacon Hill family bungalow . Dorrie thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they lived on . " Ferdinand , " she would say out of the side of her mouth , " like the dictator . " And Dome , who was fond of the character that would n't fight , would counter , " Like the bull . " Tonight she would work the Academy Awards show , and at the right moment would put her carefully considered , nonmilitant , inoffensive plan into effect . <p> She arrived in uniform-a blue-sequined evening gown with silver spaghetti straps that dropped the neckline at a judicious pitch , low enough to flatter , but not enough to rival the ingenious mammary displays of the starlets . A slit up the back center seam served the double purpose of giving a teasing view of her legs and a necessary means of navigation within the tight confines of the gown . <p> She took her place in the wings with the other blue-sequined attendants . As Billy Crystal started his monologue , which after a week of rehearsal was as funny to her as her mother in hot pants , she doublechecked the script and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She would deliver the Oscar into the hands of Uma Thurman and Sylvester Stallone , who in turn would present it to the winner for the best documentary . <p> As she waited she reviewed the steps in her plan , for they were literally steps . She had decided she would make her statement with graceful , eloquent enhancements of her walk to the podium . Holding the Oscar aloft , she would waltz to midstage , make a lilting turn , dipping the Oscar like a partner in an Argentine tango , resume her swaying rhythm until she reached the podium , when she would rock back on one leg , then forward on the other to accentuate her passing of the statuette into the hands of the celebrity presenters , Uma and Sly . A quiet but clearly discernible statement . With dignity <p> They were 20 minutes into the show and only the first two attendants had completed their delivery and escort duties . Ashley , a blond from Texas who aspired to either veterinary college or massage therapy school , and who marveled that anyone of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puddly place like Seattle , was in front of Dorrie , and Dorrie had a sudden impulse to reveal her plan to her . Instead Dorrie just said , " Good luck . " Ashley replied with a quizzical and somewhat suspicious look , nearly missing her cue to carry an Oscar out onstage to Cher and Sting . Dorrie had hoped to get a different response from Ashley-a " Good luck " in return , or " Same to you , " maybe a thumbs up or just a smile from her perfect , capped teeth . <p> Feeling slightly nervous at the head of the attendant line , Dorrie grabbed an Oscar from the nearby table , where a platoon of them were lined up at attention . She held it at the base the way she was supposed to , enjoyed the weight of it in her hand . Then she ran her fingers over the body of the statuette the way she was n't supposed to , noticing with a kind of detachment the smudges she made on the gleaming surface . It was comforting , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her a sense of purpose , so when she walked onstage , it was with an upwelling of confidence that she executed her flourishes , first at center stage and then again near the podium . She knew she had made an impression when she saw Uma 's astonished gape and Sly 's amused grin . Uma held her hands out for the Oscar to present to the jubilant winner loping his way up to the stage , but something in Dorrie made her resist , making it necessary for Uma to yank it from her , nearly yanking along Dorrie , who had still been posed in the weightforward position of her final flourish . <p> Dorrie regained her balance , and with it a new boldness . Instead of stepping offcamera , she remained at Uma 's shoulder while the jubilant winner leaned into the microphone . As it amplified his breathless thanks to his family , film crew and former kindergarten teacher to the packed theater , Dorrie understood the power of the microphone and the knock of opportunity As soon as the jubilant winner concluded his speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lacking any prepared speech of her own , she instinctively spoke her name , adding the pronunciation clues with extra earnestness- " Dorrie Mangosing , " " a " as in ah , accent on the " go . " <p> It was the word " go " that woke her to the fact that everyone who had been onstage with her was now gone-along with the spotlight and the camera . Alone at the darkened podium , she was aware now , too , of the swell of music from the orchestra pit and wondered how long it had been filling the ears of the audience . It was clear that no one had heard her . But she said it again anyway Dorrie Mangosing . This time she added , " From Seattle , " a tiny , whispered amulet of reassurance inside the vast cavern of loneliness on stage . It was a loneliness she had never quite felt before . But the aloneness was something she recognized . Under the clatter of a troupe of tap dancers that had spilled onto center stage , Dorrie made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manager was waiting to escort her to the theater exit . <p> She crossed the boulevard in the neon Hollywood night . Tomorrow , she might feel humiliated , she thought . But tonight , smiling to herself through tears , she felt liberated . She lifted the hem of her bluesequined gown to step awkwardly onto the curb . Perhaps there was something to be said for wearing hot pants . Squash-colored polyester , she reminded herself , with only a hint of a wince . She headed to the pay phone on the corner and dialed collect . She was certain that her mother back home in Seattle would accept . <p>
