left-Hip-hop heavyweight trio SaltN-Pepa is still at the top of its game . Members ( l-r ) Sandi " Pepa " Denton , Cheryl " Salt " James and Dee Dee " Spinderella " Roper are back with the new album , Brand New . // Salt-N-Pepa , that sensuous , hip Shop/rap trio , has had strong sex appeal to men since the group was conceived 11 years ago . Now , the ladies have a few messages for male fans to teach them things they need to know about how to treat their special women . " We 've always talked about men in our albums and shows , " Dee Dee " Spinderella " Roper said in an interview the trio recently gave JET . " We 've got issues about relationships . Sometimes men need a little help in knowing what a woman likes . " Sandi " Pepa " Denton agreed . " We want to please the man , but you have to make me want to please you . You have to take care of me and inspire me to please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that men should always treat their special ladies like they 're queens . " We tell women that if he 's not treating you like a queen , then he 's not your king . Point blank . " Denton said that when men do n't do all those necessary special things , women should know they can walk . And the trio wants to put men on notice that , through its music , the group is urging females to walk away if their needs are n't being met . The single Do Me Right says : " I want the baby carriage and the marriage and the whole thing , diamond ring , treat you like a king . " But , guys ca n't just sit back and be worshipped without giving as much as they get , the trio pointed out . Far from being male-bashers , the trio said that a number of its songs have saluted men . The group just wants men to be mature , generous and romantically responsive to women .

A lot of guys have always assumed that Push It , the group 's megahit from 1986 , was about sex . But , she contends the song was about dancing , even though she is sure most men wo n't believe it . Photograph Holding a plaque with the group 's gold and platinum albums , Salt-N-Pepa has always made it a point to send a message in its rap lyrics . On Brand New , the rap veterans deal with relationships , sex , racism and spirituality .

" Some of the serious messages for men come as a result of domestic violence . On its new album , Brand New , the trio has a cut entitled The Clock Is Tickin ' ( inspired by the O.J. Simpson trial ) that tackles the subject of abuse . A primary lesson that the members want to teach male fans is that verbal and physical violence should both be avoided at all costs . " Personally , abuse comes in a lot of different ways , " James said . " You can be in a relationship where a person ignores you . Or you can get hit physically . So , from experiences that I 've seen in my friends and what I 've gone through , you can get out ( of a bad relationship ) . A lot of women feel they ca n't get out . The record is saying , Where there 's a will , there 's a way . Life is short and time is running out . So , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not treating you like a queen , he definitely is not your king . " ' Brand New tackles male and female relationships , sex , racism and spirituality . It 's called Brand New because , although it 's the trio 's fifth album , this marks the first time that Salt-N-Pepa 's members have written and produced virtually the entire project . Previous projects had been written or co-written by the group 's founder , Hurby " Luv Bug " Azor . The album has an all-star roster . Kirk Franklin and the Sounds of Blackness are featured on Hold On ; Queen Latifah appeared on and helped to write Friend ; and Sheryl Crow sang on Imagine , a song about the evils of racism . The group 's previous four albums all went platinum ( more than a million in sales ) . And the ladies are hoping that this one will soar even higher . " We hope this album will sell 15 million copies . That is our goal , " James said . Roper attributes the group 's popularity to the messages it puts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal with real issues , " she said . " Whether it 's spirituality or dealing with men , we have been in relationships where we have dealt with it like anybody else . We talk about it on the album , and people respect that . " All three women hail from the News York area . James and Denton met as freshmen at Queensborough Community College . They worked at a local Sears where they met Azor . Soon , they began rapping and singing together . In 1986 , they added a deejay , Pamela Greene . Greene soon married and was replaced by Dee Dee Roper , who was still in high school in Brooklyn when she and the others convinced her reluctant family to let her join the group . All three women , who are in their 30s , are single mothers and quickly pointed out that parenthood makes recording and touring very , very diffcult . " It 's not easy , " Roper said . " We 're taking the kids on the road with us next year . We have a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have nannies to help with their children . Each member has one child . Roper has a 5-year-old daughter , James has a daughter , 6 , and Denton 's son is 7 . " Since mine is the youngest , I get advice from them , " Roper said . The trio acknowledges that some out there are surprised that the group has been able to flourish for so long . " Some people have been predicting the end of Salt-N-Pepa since the beginning , " Denton said . " People are like , Damn , those girls are still around ! They just keep coming back stronger and stronger every time . ' There are people out there for us and some against us . I do n't know why . We do n't bother anybody . People pray for our downfall . We keep the faith and know that we are truly blessed . Still against the odds , three Black girls from the ghetto in hip hop music ! Not too many other females have done it . And we continue to do it .

" Until we say it 's over , it 's going to continue . We 're not going to let anybody dictate to us when it 's over . So , we go through the drudgery of missing our kids . We stick to one another , bond with one another , support one another . And the three of us make it through together . " Sure they have their personality clashes since they are in one another 's presence constantly . But , they never allow conflicts to cause problems . " We 've kept clashes down because we respect one another 's individuality , " Roper said . " We 're three different personalities , but we respect and complement one another .
