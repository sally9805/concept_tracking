Do your skis feel erratic ? Hard to control ? Perhaps the bevel is making them do it . Whether your skis are conventional or shaped , their edges need to be correctly beveled , or angled , along both the side and base , with different degrees of bevel appropriate for different skiing styles . A base edge bevel facilitates turn initiation . Nearly every ski is manufactured with edges that are beveled one half to one degree-about one third the thickness of a piece of paper-with more base bevel being suitable for less skilled skiers . Side edge bevel improves grip on hard snow and ice . On conventional skis , the side edge angle ranges from zero to four degrees , with more bevel being used for aggressive skiing and harder snow surfaces . Together , the base and side bevels create an overall edge angle . For most skiers on conventional skis , this angle should be 90 degrees , with more acute angles for very hard snow ( see diagram ) . New shaped carving skis slightly defy the conventional laws of skisharpening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of shaped skis recommend a base bevel of one half to one degree and a side bevel of zero to one degree . The new tuning specs are a result of the skis ' dramatic shape , which allows them to carve more easily without needing the extra bite that acute edge angles provide . There are many easy-touse tools that will ensure you do a good job when working on your own skis . Costing $10 to $50 , they are available at many of your favorite ski shops and from catalog companies . The simplest of these , sleeves and guides , hold a mill file or abrasive stone at a fixed angle to bevel the edge . What is the difference between a sleeve and a guide ? Not much . They work essentially the same way . The more complex tools have adjustable tuning and sharpening angles and accept interchangeable files and stones . Even if you 're only slightly handy , all of these tools are easy to get the hang of . The angles applied to the base and side edges of your skis need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why it 's important to select a tool that allows you to maintain a constant bevel angle . ( Avoid tools that work off the ski 's opposite edge , which will result in an inconsistent bevel as the ski widens and narrows . ) All of the tools we reviewed in this article were acceptably accurate when measured with a Bevlgage-a laser instrument that measures base and side edge geometry within one half of a degree . When you purchase a tool to care for your skis , be sure to ask a shop technician how to use it correctly for the best results . You should also know that working on your ski edges will be easier if the skis are secured in ski vises , so consider purchasing a set . ( Be advised , however , that if your skis ' edges are really worn , you 'll need to have the bases and edges ground flat before any of these tools can do their job . ) Whether you 're using a sleeve or an adjustable tool , the first thing you need to do is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This eliminates any burrs and hardened areas and will allow the file to cut cleanly and smoothly . Diamond stones are also great for maintaining a shop bevel ( but not for actually beveling the edges , since they do not cut aggressively enough ) , and can be used without the aid of vises . Next , replace the diamond stone with a file and work your way from tip to tail , using gentle pressure and allowing the tool to follow the profile of the edge . How do you know when you 've achieved the desired bevel ? One effective way is to color the edges with a permanent marker . Once the ink is gone , enough edge has been removed . Lastly , replace the file with a carborundum or ceramic stone and smooth the edge . After you have sharpened and smoothed your ski edges , use a gummi stone , which is a pliable abrasive block , to dull the corners of the edges along the skis ' widest points at the shovel and tail areas . This takes away a little bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't be brought back easily with a diamond or carborundum stone . It relaxes the shovels just a bit and eliminates any hooky or grabby feeling you may feel when your skis start to arc into their turn . If you 're an advanced or expert skier , dull about two to four inches of each edge . If you 're a beginner or intermediate , dulling three to six inches will help make your turn initiations easier . If you have successfully completed the edge work on your skis , you might as well go ahead and wax them . Waxing helps protect your ski bases , as well as enabling them to slide more easily over the snow . Many products are available that make ski waxing as easy to do as waxing the car-wipe on , let dry , lightly buff to polish . And whether you have a shop bevel your skis , or you bevel them yourself , be sure to touch up the edges every few days of skiing . That way your skis will always feel freshly tuned , letting you have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're out on the hill . // TOOLS FOR BEVELVING SKI EDGES // <p>
