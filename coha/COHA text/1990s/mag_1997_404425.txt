From birth to 12 months BABIES AND DOGS Boots was a high-spirited border collie . Although she sometimes got overly excited and difficult to manage , her owners really liked her . Then the baby came along . Suddenly , the long walks that Boots lived for were hard to fit in . Suddenly , her barking and racing around the house were major problems . Boots spent more and more time tied in the backyard , and before long an energetic dog had become a problem dog . Within a year of the baby 's birth , the family had to give Boots up . It does n't have to be that way . Dogs and babies can coexist nicely , and even become fast friends . The dog our family adopted happened to bc a natural with kids . Through three babyhoods , Jay was the best cure for inconsolable crying . We 'd call her over , and our kids would cheer up at the sight of her . They tossed the dog illicit treats from their high-chair , learned to crawl by following her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her . She was unfailingly patient , quiet and gentle . It was plain dumb luck on our part . But you ca n't count on luck . A much better option , says dog trainer and mother of three Deb McCann , is to teach your dog to fit into family life before you have babies . It starts , she says , with basic obedience . Your dog should clearly understand that you are in charge , " says McCann , who with her husband Marta , runs McCann Professional Dog Trainers in the Dundas , Ontario area . " If you can not control your dog , work first on obedience commands . You 'll need them . " Think about what life with a baby will be like , suggests Brian Kilcommons in his book Childproofing Your Dog , and about whether any of your dog 's current habits are going to cause problems once the baby is born . Are you going to want him sleeping on the couch once you 're nursing the baby there ? If not , dethrone him now , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way he jumps up to beg for a walk be cute when you 've got a crying baby in your arms ? Better work on his manners . Will you want him playing " chase " when your baby is learning to walk ? If not , then it 's time to stop wild play in the house . What else can you do before the baby is born ? " Socialize your dog to kids from puppyhood , " advises McCann . " Dogs do n't even really identify babies and toddlers as people  --  they sound different , they move erratically , they 're way smaller . To a dog that is n't used to them , young children can be very disturbing . " If your older dog has had no contact with kids , or if you see a reaction that worries you , consult a trainer . Once the baby is born , McCann stresses the need for supervision whenever the dog and the baby are together . That way , you can ensure safety and nip inappropriate behaviour  --  from either one  --  in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good idea to let the dog be over-familiar with the baby , licking and ShUffling at her , " says McCann . " A polite sniff is but the baby should clearly be yours . You do n't want him to see the baby as another dog . " ( Besides , a dog 's mouth is n't likely to be sparkly clean ! ) Other good strategies : Exercise . Kilcommons writes , " Exercise is the best problem preventative there is . " If you ca n't keep up your dog 's walk routine now that you have a baby to care for , consider hiring a teenager to take him out after school . Neuter your dog . " Neutering does n't change the dog 's temperament , " says McCann , " but it reduces dominant or aggressive behaviour . A neutered or spayed dog is a much better pet . " Use a crate . A crate gives you a break from the dog when you have too much to cope with already  --  and once your baby is mobile , it gives your dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't used to a crate , you can use some other comfortable place  --  another room or an outdoor run . As your baby becomes a toddler , suggests McCann , teach her that we " never bug the dog when he 's in his crate . " Accustom your dog to baby manners . As she grows up , your baby should be taught to pat gently , stay away from the food bowl , and let sleeping dogs lie . ( This last one is important , says McCann . Gentle dogs have been known to snap in a startle reflex when suddenly awakened by a toddler hug . ) But there will be slip-ups . So , says McCann , teach your dog to tolerate slightly rough handling from you : " Do n't hurt your dog , but take a hold of a roll of skin and pull it a little , while giving him a treat and praising him . Give his ears a tug . " Good dog ! " Make a squealy sound , grab hold of his tail , and give him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being handled . " Similarly , Kilcommons advises gradually training your dog to accept interruptions while he 's eating . Start by giving his meal in small installments , so you 're picking up his dish frequently . Then add some treats to his meal while he 's still eating . Gradually build up the level of interference until you can put your hand right in his dish while he eats , gently bump him , or grab a toy beside him . If your dog growls or stiffens , back off and consult a trainer . Indeed , growling for any reason but play is a sign of potential trouble that should not be ignored . Although most dogs adapt easily to a new baby and become trusted family pets , a very few , for safety 's sake , should not live with kids . And sometimes , a good dog gets on the wrong track , and things need to turn around fast . As McCann says , " You ca n't take a chance when it comes to kids . " If your dog growls , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your baby , get the advice of a reputable trainer right away .  --  H.B. From 1 to 2 THE TIDY TODDLER Toddlers seem to come in two varieties : There 's the " I love mess ! " toddler who wants to eat chocolate pudding with his bare hands , can be found searching the compost pile for items of potential interest , and is drawn to mud puddles like steel to a magnet . Then there is Mr. Fastidious , who wants to wear rubber gloves when working with clay , clutches his napkin during meals and uses it after every bite , and sticks to the sidewalk when you walk past a park . Two-year-old Michael is the classic clean-and-neat toddler . Here 's how his mother , Sandra , describes one of their outings : We went to the beach to see the ducks . He loved the ducks , but he 'd barely stepped on the beach when he discovered that he had sand in his shoes . Immediately , he ran back to the grass . I had to take off his shoes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shoes to make sure there was no sand left , wipe off his feet ( he was n't wearing socks ) and then put the shoes back on . Then he refused to set foot on the sand again . He watched the ducks from the grass . " Michael 's caregiver , Gemma , calls him Felix after the neat half of The Odd Couple . If his hands get dirty when he 's playing outside , he wo n't brush them off on his pants ; Gemma has to get him a cloth . If he plays in the sandbox , he wants to wash up immediately . Catherine Moher , co-ordinator of Toronto 's Gerrard Research Centre ( which runs playgroups for toddlers ) , says she 's seen many toddlers like Michael . " It 's important that these near-and-clean kids do n't get left out of the fun and activities because they 're so concerned about keeping clean . There are ways to modify play to help even the most fastidious toddler get involved . " For example , many clean-conscious toddlers do n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to " drive " through the paint and make designs , or a plastic dinosaur to use like a stamp and make dinosaur footprints across the piece of paper . Or the child could use a plastic doll , and push her hand through the paint . " The child stays clean and the toys can be washed  --  and these kids usually love to play in water . " Toys such as buckets and shovels can also make sandbox play more appealing to the tidy toddler . " They do n't have to dig with their hands , " Moher points out . She will sometimes bury a favourite toy in the sand to encourage a reluctant child to get in there to " rescue " the toy lion . While , in many cases , a child 's tendency toward neatness is simply an inborn trait , Moher thinks that sometimes it 's a parent 's attitude that encourages a toddler to be overly clean . " I 've watched parents vigorously brush the sand off their child the second he steps back from the sandbox , or stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he gets some paint on his clothes . " Dressing children appropriately for messy play is important . " Let your child know that play clothes are good for getting dirty in , that keeping them clean is n't necessary . " A comment like " Do n't worry , it 'll wash out " can help your child develop a more casual attitude toward keeping clean . If you think you may have stressed cleanliness a bit too much with your toddler , Moher suggests you join right in with the fingerpainting or jump into the sandbox and help dig a tunnel with your bare hands . Your enthusiasm might be all the encouragement your little one needs . Because she and her husband are n't especially tidy , Michael 's mother Sandra feels that her son 's neatness is just part of his personality . " His older sister Melissa , who is five now , has never been this way . I actually wish some of Michael 's neatness would rub off on her ! " Michael not only wants to keep himself clean , he tidies up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using a paper towel to mop up the puddle left behind from his dad 's boots or pushing all the chairs in around the dining-room table . His toy cars are always kept in neat rows . " That 's just the way our little Felix Unger is , " Sandra says .  --  T.P. From 3 to 5 PRESCHOOLER 'S GARDEN Five-year-old Dean 's sleeves are pushed up almost to his shoulders and he 's elbow-deep in dirt . Suddenly , one soil-covered hand surfaces : " Look what I found ! " he says , dangling a juicy , pink worm from his index finger . Beside him , three-year-old Oliver is scooping out mounds of soil with a child-sized trowel . Dean and Oliver are getting ready to plant their summer vegetable garden , with just a bit of supervision from senior green thumb and dad , Chad Wolfond . All winter we talk about what they like to eat and what would be fun to grow , " says Wolfond . " Then I let the kids make the final selection . " Since Dean was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the garden , so it was natural for Dean , and then Oliver , to become curious about dad 's mucking around . Wolfond was quick to grab this opportunity to turn his kids on to his favourite hobby . " Right away I could see their primary interest was going to be food plants , so I forgot about growing flowers with them . " According to Wolfond , growing vegetables with children has a nutritional bonus . " My kids will eat vegetables they 've grown themselves that they otherwise would n't touch . " In addition to tomatoes , cucumbers and carrots , the Wolfonds have successfully grown ( and eaten ) broccoli , beets , peppers and zucchini . Kathy Dueck is the co-ordinator for the Peterborough ( Ontario ) Ecology Park , a five-acre area of parkland that 's been dedicated to environmental education . She says that Wolfond has zeroed in on one of the main attractions gardening holds for kids  --  its sensory appeal . Children this age , she explains , most enjoy gardening when they can taste , smell or touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garden at the ecology park , kids get lots of opportunities for " scratch and sniff " exploration . Kids are encouraged to rub the leaves of the lemon verbena plant , for example , and note the way it scents their fingers . Or they can put their noses close to the leaves of the peppermint plant and guess what it is from its strong and easily identifiable smell . The sensitive plant , or mimosa , is another favourite because of the way it responds to a child 's touch by closing up its leaves . Another way to make a garden more interesting to preschoolers , says Dueck , is to plant flowers that attract birds . " When you plant a garden , you invite in a whole ecosystem . Kids are fascinated when they begin to realize the relationships between plants and the animals that depend on them . " She suggests planting cosmos ( a brightly coloured annual ) , bachelor buttons ( which come in an assortment of blue , pink and white ) and sunflowers to bring chickadees and goldfinches . Hummingbirds are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an easy-to-grow perennial ) and nicotiana ( a plant from the tobacco family ) , but consider planting nicotiana only if your kids are well past the exploration-by-mouth stage  --  its leaves are toxic . Wolfond also believes that children get something special out of working with the soil . " I think the " chores "  --  watering , harvesting  --  give them a certain amount of responsibility and a feeling of accomplishment . " For example , " they have to know when the pepper turns orange , yellow or red , it 's ready . That 's something kids this age can decide on their own . " Wolfond says that making these small decisions is very gratifying for his kids . " They are tremendously excited when they come in with a cucumber or they find a pea pod hiding within the plant . " And what if they make a mistake ? " If , when they pull a cucumber off , the whole vine rips , I just say , " Oh well . " If they ruin the garden , I try to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're likely to become frustrated when little feet step on your prized vegetables or delicate pansies , you should make a separate space for your children 's garden . " Then it 's easier to be relaxed about it . " Dueck agrees , adding the following caveat : " Do n't turn this into work . I do n't like the approach of giving the child a garden and saying " Now it 's your duty to keep it weed-free . ' Work alongside your child  --  help her . The most important thing is the joyful interaction with nature . " If you 're keen to set up a garden with your preschooler , but a bit green when it comes to gardening , here are a few tips : There is a greater variety of plants that will do well in bright areas , so if you can , stake out a place in the sun for your preschooler 's garden . The first few weeks after planting are critical . As the plants start to sprout , you 'll want to keep them moist by watering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plants ' roots have grown deeper into the ground , you can reduce the maintenance of your garden by mulching the soil with straw , leaves or wood chips to hold moisture in . Now you 'll need to water less often . Encourage your child to pay attention to the weather conditions and give the garden a good soaking once or twice a week on average  --  more often if it has been really hot and dry , less often if there 's been lots of rain . You can start your seeds indoors in peat pots and then deposit the young plants , pots and all , into the garden . ( The pots decompose in the soil and are environmentally friendly . ) Many green thumbs get the most satisfaction when they raise a garden from seeds , but if you 're looking for a quick fix and you do n't mind spending a bit more , seedlings from your local garden store or greenhouse offer instant gratification . Even when we do all we can to speed the process along , gardeners , especially young ones , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that with just a little encouragement , our kids will become happily spellbound by what 's going on around their plants . " Most kids are naturally fascinated by insects . Have them look at the ground closely and think about what the bugs are doing . Are they responding to the weather conditions ? The water your child just poured ? This kind of perspective really helps kids develop empathy toward other living things . " Worms , she adds , are great for your garden , too . You do n't have to have a backyard for your child to enjoy gardening . If you have a lot of sun , try growing tomatoes in pots . For balconies that do n't get full sun , try lettuce , spinach or herbs like basil , chives or oregano . Also a great variety of annual flowers can be maintained in pots in a range of conditions . Digging around in the dirt , checking out bugs , working shoulder to shoulder with you  --  there 's a lot about growing a garden that 's alluring to your preschooler . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earth is important . Says Dueck , " Parents sharing the wonderful mysteries of the outdoors with their kids is the very best way to bring up responsible citizens of the environment . "  --  H.B. From 6 to 8 I HATE BOYS ! " " I HATE GIRLS ! " Look at those dumb-looking boys . " My seven-year-old daughter makes this offhanded comment about a group of fairly typical teenage boys who walk past our house . " What 's so dumb about them ? " I venture . " Oh , they 're just so dumb-looking . " This turns out to be the tip of the iceberg : She wo n't sit beside a boy at a movie , wo n't let a male stylist cut her hair , misses outings if it means being in the car with her brother and his friends . What kind of prejudiced little creature am I raising ? How can she pass judgement on half the population when she knows nothing about them , except their gender ? No need to worry . According to Mary Gordon , administrator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we should n't be surprised if our children try out these stereotypes . The " I hate boys/girls " routine is " an absolutely normal , expected behaviour pattern in our culture . " At six , boys and girls often still play together , but by seven or eight they have typically separated themselves by sex , and there may be little interaction between the two groups . Why ? Partly because boys and girls are likely to begin to play differently , no matter how sensitive our parenting . Gordon explains that girls ' play is often modelled on nurturing and relationships  --  their games accented by compliments and encouragement . And girls often prefer to play with one or two special friends at a time . Boys , on the other hand , tend to play in larger groups . Their play is often boisterous , active and competitive . While there 's a lot of variation within each gender ( there are certainly rambunctious girls and nurturing boys ) Gordon says that " children do have a proclivity to certain types of behaviour . It 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peter , is definitely " a team player . There is no active avoidance of girls , he simply sees the opposite sex as the other team , " she says . Children this age do tend to view gender in black and white terms . If her brother is loud and wild , your daughter may decide that all boys are loud and wild . If the girl who sits beside your son is " goofy , " it 's easy for him to extend this rule to all girls . But as experience and cognitive abilities grow , your child will become more open-minded , and he 'll begin to see that people ca n't be defined by gender alone . Lamar Mason 's seven-year-old daughter , Samantha , has three older brothers , and finds boys pretty difficult to deal with . " They pick on you , " she says . Mason explains this gender division within her family . " Sometime around seven or eight , they stop being children and become boys . They begin to have to keep up with their peers . Their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did like dolls or other " girl stuff , " they would never say so because they 're aware of how their peers would react . " Mason sees this need to be accepted by peers as the root of I-hate-girls thinking : " It 's not so much that they hate girls . It 's that they identify so strongly with their own group . " That 's the key , says Gordon . " Belonging to a group is essential and belonging to one group means , to some extent , excluding another group . " For children of both sexes , " belonging is a fabulous agent of socialization . It teaches and reinforces standards of behaviour . " So in the meantime , what can you do to encourage tolerance of the opposite sex ? Help your child identify what she is feeling : " You hate the way that boy is rough , but that does n't mean you hate all boys . " If you 're not comfortable with your seven-year-old 's conviction that girls are " gross " or that boys are " crazy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to participate in some mixed activities . Gordon says that getting together in settings like choir , art lessons or the chess club helps children realize they can have fun with the opposite sex , that girls ( or boys ) are n't stupid , that they are all competent . For seven-year-old Rosie , the breakthrough began when her neighbours adopted a quiet little boy from Poland . They spent many afternoons roller-bidding and gradually , Rosie 's conviction that boys are always loud and obnoxious softened . A friendship began . Gordon says excluding the opposite sex at this age does play a positive role in children 's evolving view of themselves . After all , it wo n't be too many years before disdain turns to fascination . By sticking to members of their own sex , " children are figuring out their sex-role identities before they hit adolescence . " First you learn who you are and what it means to be a boy or a girl , in all its amazing complexity . Then you figure out how to approach members of that other amazing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GROWING PAINS When Debbie Rodrigues ' daughter , Erica , woke up in the night crying because her legs hurt with mysterious pains , her mother knew exactly what was going on . I was the only one in my family of eight children to have growing pains , and I know how much they can hurt , " Rodrigues says . " They started when I was about seven and gradually faded away by the time I was ten . " Erica 's followed a similar pattern , starting when she was about eight and ending when she was ten . James Wright , a paediatrician in the clinical epidemiology unit at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto , has conducted research on this puzzling malady . " Growing pains have been reported in children anywhere from two to 19 years of age , but the most common ages are between three and five years , and eight and 12 years . " What do these pains feel like ? Children describe them as intense aches that seem to be deep inside the muscles  --  usually the thighs or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the evening or at night , and may be intense enough to wake a sleeping child . By morning , the pain is often gone . Despite the name " growing pains , " the condition does n't seem to be related to growth . As Dr. Wright points out , " growth declines between the ages of four and 12 years , when the incidence of growing pains peaks . " Several theories have been proposed for the causes of growing pains , but there is little solid evidence to support any of them . One promising hypothesis is that muscle fatigue is to blame . " If this theory is correct , it could suggest involuntary muscle spasms as the cause of growing pains , " explains Wright . A 1998 study by Ottawa paediatricians Baxter and Dulberg set up two groups of children . One group was asked to do muscle-stretching exercises twice daily to reduce the incidence of growing pains ; the other , a control group , did not do the exercises . They found that the frequency of the growing pains was reduced for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , Wright feels more research needs to be done to confirm these results . The theory makes sense to Rodrigues : " I know I was a very active child , and Erica is the same way . She 's just on the run all day . I think that tiredness might well be the cause , or at least one of the causes . " Her family doctor recommended the stretching exercises for Erica , but they did n't seem to make much difference . When Rodrigues herself was a child experiencing growing pains , her mother used the then-standard treatment of wrapping her legs in brown paper and vinegar to ease the pain . Rodrigues remembers that " it seemed to work , but I wonder now if the comfort really came from having my mother 's loving attention . " While she does n't bring out the brown paper and vinegar , Rodrigues does try to give her daughter some of that same comfort . " I 'll sit with her and massage her legs , " she says . " The pain always goes away eventually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can remind your child that nothing is seriously wrong and that in time , the pains will stop on their own . I think it 's also important to acknowledge that the pain is real and can be quite intense , " adds Rodrigues . " I know , I still remember what it felt like ! You may not be able to stop it from hurting , but you can be comforting . " Wright feels that patents should not be the ones to diagnose their kids ' aches as growing pains . Other conditions can cause similar discomfort and your child 's physician may wish to do some tests to rule these out . The doctor may also be able to suggest some other treatments that might help .  --  T.P.
