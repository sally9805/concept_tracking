<p> There 's a possibility that a little-known rule will allow Colorado 's Andres Galarraga to win the National League batting championship even if he falls short of having the necessary 502 plate appearances . <p> Galarraga currently is far ahead of the NL pack with a .392 average , but he does n't have enough plate appearances to be listed among the league leaders . A player needs 3.1 plate appearances per game his team has played . Galarraga is on the disabled list with 332 plate appearances . Entering the weekend , he would have needed 357 , since the Rockies had played 115 games . <p> However , there is a rule that if a batter has the top average but does not have enough plate appearances to qualify , as many plate appearances as needed to get him to 502 can be added . They would count against him as hitless at-bats . <p> If that player 's average remains higher than any other hitter 's , he is declared the batting champion . Oddly , the winning average would be listed as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is if a hitter were at the .400 mark without the requisite appearances . Major League baseball will not recognize the .400 as being legitimate without enough plate appearances . <p> Entering the weekend , Galarraga could take an 0-for-25 and still have a .362 average . San Diego 's Tony Gwynn was hitting a legit .354 through Thursday . <p> " " I did n't know anything about the rule , but it throws a different light on the situation as far as I 'm concerned , " said Gwynn , who is trying for his fifth batting title . " " If that happens , that happens . I 've already got four ( batting titles ) in the bank . But if you 're Orlando Merced or John Kruk or Barry Bonds or one of these other guys , when they see that , they 're going to flip . They 're going to jump out of their shoes when they hear that one . " <p> Imagine if Bonds leads the league in homers and RBIs but is denied the Triple Crown because of this rule . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs 170 plate appearances in roughly 35 games , about five per game . Rockies manager Don Baylor has said that , if necessary , he will use him as the leadoff man to help him get more plate appearances . <p> " " He 'll be the biggest leadoff man in baseball history , " said Baylor . <p> At least once this season , a reporter has noticed Astros manager Art Howe getting off the elevator before a game and theorized that he had been summoned upstairs to owner Drayton McLane 's eighth-floor office in the Astrodome for a dressing-down . <p> Howe had been in McLane 's office , but there was nothing sinister behind it . The owner has instituted meetings with Howe and the Astros ' front-office staff about once every two weeks . <p> " " We 've started a practice of meeting with ( general manager ) Bill ( Wood , ) ( assistant GM ) Bob Watson , Art and myself every other week , " said McLane . " " We talk about everything . Every player , the good and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have individual meetings and then a group meeting . <p> " " We also bring in one coach to each meeting . I want to see how they feel about things . I ask them , " " If you owned the team , what would you do differently ? ' It 's funny because when you get them in a group , they do n't say much . But one-on-one , they all have strong opinions . " <p> One person that Nolan Ryan badly wants at his celebration Sept.12 at Arlington Stadium is California Angels coach Jimmie Reese . When Ryan played for the Angels in the 1970s , he thought so much of Reese that he named his second son after the legendary coach . <p> But Reese , 91 , is ailing in California and may not be able to attend the ceremonies in Texas . <p> " " He 's a dear , dear friend of mine , " said Ryan . " " He 's meant more to me that people will ever know . I 'd really like him to be with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's possible . He 's been bedridden for some time . " <p> After Ryan made his remarks last week , someone in the Angels ' front office checked in on Reese and found him to be optimistic he could attend next month 's festivities . <p> California manager Buck Rodgers says he has learned his lesson about telling players to accept league-imposed suspensions for fighting . Back in June , he advised Angels center fielder Chad Curtis to accept a three-game suspension without an appeal . <p> In the last week , the American League reduced Toronto 's Ed Sprague 's suspension from three games to two games and sat down Chicago 's Robin Ventura for two games for his infamous charge to the mound against Nolan Ryan . <p> " " That will be the last time I 'll recommend anyone accept a suspension , " said Rodgers . " " I thought I was doing Chad Curtis a favor , but look at what happened . As usual , baseball backed off because they 're afraid of controversy . <p> " " The point is , the guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backed off . In other words , he admitted to screwing up in the first place . We 've got to get some people in there who have some guts . They ( Brown and NL president Bill White ) had good intentions when they first took the job , but the system brought them to their knees . <p> " " I think once these guys leave , we 'll never have league presidents again . " <p> Rodgers had an interesting perspective on the resurgence of Florida reliever Bryan Harvey , who was left unprotected by the Angels in the expansion draft and has 35 saves for the Marlins . <p> " " When he 's on , like he was the other day when I saw him on TV , he just overmatches everyone . I 've never seen anyone like him . <p> But remember , it took three years for him to develop . It takes time for these closers . Look at Harvey . He cost two managers ( Cookie Rojas and Doug Rader ) their jobs before he became a star . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For instance , entering the weekend , the Astros ' catching platoon of Scott Servais and Eddie Taubensee had combined for a .262 average , 17 homers and 59 RBIs . Only first baseman Jeff Bagwell , with 19 , had more home runs for the Astros than the combined catchers . <p> In Philadelphia , left fielders Pete Incaviglia and Milt Thompson had a combined 24 homers and 100 RBIs . New York Yankees catchers Mike Stanley and Matt Nokes combined for 28 homers and 88 RBIs . <p> The last Yankees catcher to hit 28 homers by himself was Elston Howard in 1962 . Yogi Berra hit 30 in 1956 . <p> While the Los Angeles Dodgers were losing four straight games at home to Colorado , manager Tom Lasorda called a pregame team meeting . After that , the players closed the clubhouse doors for a session . Their mood was not altogether positive . <p> " " Things are going just the same as the season has gone , " said center fielder Brett Butler . " " We have great days and bad days . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't . <p> There are some players who get upset when we lose and other players who could n't care less . There are some who have given up on the season and others who wo n't give up until we are mathematically eliminated . <p> " " This is common for a losing team , but not for a winning team . A winning team is all on the same page . At time , it 's been that way , and at times it has n't been . This is one of the lowest points of the season . " Several Dodgers questioned the direction the Dodgers were taking this season , wondering why top prospect Raul Mondesi was sent back to the minors after playing about one month in Los Angeles . <p> " " There is a direction , and it does n't mean it needs to be ( playing ) eight players from our farm system , " said general manager Fred Claire . " " The goal is to both win and build , and it can be done doing both . Have we achieved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a temporary setback last week for those of us who believe the Detroit Tigers will allow more runs than they score . <p> During a three-game series against Baltimore , the Tigers scored 47 runs , hit 10 homers ( including three grand slams ) and hit .410 . All that with just one RBI from Cecil Fielder . <p> Entering the weekend , the Tigers had scored a league-high 655 runs and allowed a league-high 607 , back to plus-48 . There are 46 games left , though , plenty of time for the Tigers ' pitching staff to adjust those numbers . <p> Since Bobby Thigpen saved his record 57th game for the Chicago White Sox in 1990 , he is 8-8 with 53 saves , a 4.41 ERA and has allowed 19 home runs . Thigpen last his closer 's job with the White Sox and was traded to Philadelphia last week . He 'll be a middle reliever for the Phillies . <p> " " What 's different ? How have I changed ? That 's what we 're here to find out , " said Thigpen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference between 1990 and now is the amount of work that I 'm getting . My big year , I was in 77 games . When I have a lot of activity , it works best for me . " <p> The Catch-22 is that unless Thigpen pitches better , he does n't figure to get the amount of work he feels he needs to be a the top of his game . <p> From San Francisco Examiner columnist Ray Ratto : " " Hey ( Bret ) Saberhagen , no problem . Nobody understood Soupy Sales in his time , either . " <p> NOTES : Neil Hohlfeld covers the Astros for the Chronicle . His notebook appears on Sundays .
