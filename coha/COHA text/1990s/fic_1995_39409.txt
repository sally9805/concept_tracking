IT WAS ONLY LATER , when the burglary was already four weeks past , that Sarah Fielding began to be aware she as traveling over familiar ground . At first it shocked her , her own callousness , that she could ever , even in her unconscious , have paired this event with that other loss , so terrible it should not be admitted into the same universe of thought with the loss of thousands of dollars worth of silverware . <p> But it was there . The loss of her family silver  --  taken one afternoon when she was out shopping , swimming at the Y , having a weekly visit with a friend  --  had undeniable echoes of the death of her daughter ten years earlier . <p> She first recognized this one morning when , seated at her desk , she became aware of an amorphous sadness , an inability to concentrate , a sense that nothing would ever be right again . She thought , " It 's the burglary , I suppose , " and then , " This feels familiar , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how I felt when Amanda died . " <p> The sequence of feeling this time was condensed  --  years of weeping collapsed into a few hours , and that only sporadic . Her neighbor Tessa had come right away in response to her phone query , " Did you see any strangers around the yard this afternoon ? Our sterling silver has been stolen . " She had said to Tessa , who was leaning forward on the sofa , her face all sympathy and eagerness , " It is , after all ; only things . " The meaning to Tessa was clear . They had been neighbors when Amanda died  --  suddenly , on an afternoon like this , though that was a Saturday and this was Thursday . <p> How long , she wondered , sitting at her desk that morning , would Thursdays , too , have their overhanging shadow ? Even now , if she felt a mood of melancholy pressing down she would think , " What day is this ? " and , if it was Saturday , acknowledge that as a contributing reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd say to her husband , Paul , after enumerating more obvious causes for feeling depressed  --  that the children lived so far away , that things were n't going as well as she 'd like with her work , that the big tree in the front yard looked severely damaged by the winter 's cold . " Sure , " he 'd say , understanding what she meant . <p> After Amanda 's death a kind of shapeless fear had pursued her . Sometimes it was a generalized fear for the safety of the children or Paul or for the survival of the race . Sometimes she could not name it at all . But it called to mind childhood fantasies of terror . Being forced to walk a gangplank  --  how would it feel to come to the end and have to step out over water ? Standing against a stone wall in some dusty courtyard , a firing squad advancing . In her mind she cowered against the wall  --  she had no blindfold . A sudden fate , unjustified , without precedent . <p> On the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours , come home just before six . It was still daylight . Paul was staying in town for a dinner meeting . She came in , put away her few purchases , called her friend Jane , who was leaving tomorrow for a month in New England . They talked for maybe half an hour . She fixed a salad and a lamb chop , then decided , since she was alone , to watch TV while she ate . She turned on the set , put down her tray and went to get a knife and fork from the silver chest in the dining room . She lifted the lid . The chest was empty . The garnet cloth-covered dividers for housing stacks of everything from fish forks to tablespoons stared vacantly back at her . Nothing . <p> She blinked  --  she had not seen it , her vision was mistaken . No . Her first thought , then , " Paul has taken the silverware for some office function and forgot to tell me . " No . Then  --  " My friend Amy , who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't had a chance to tell me yet . " No , that does not happen . <p> She opened the drawer below . The serving forks , cake knives , slotted spoons  --  pieces they 'd inherited from parents , childless aunts and uncles  --  were gone . The stainless steel steak knives were left , and a pair of plastic chopsticks . A burglary . The silver had been stolen . <p> Dazed , moving in a stilled nightmare , she called the home of friends  --  a young couple , as close to children as she had in this town . The husband answered . <p> " This is Sarah : How are you ? "  --  the amenities still intact . <p> " Oh , I 'm getting over my cold . Kate 's at an evening class . How are you ? " <p> " I 'm terrified , Ben . Our silverware has been stolen . " <p> " You hang up . I 'll be right there . " <p> She waited in the kitchen . What if the burglar were still in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> When Ben came , his car grinding into the driveway blessedly soon , they went through the rest of the house . There was no one . Some jewelry had been taken from her dresser drawer , the pyramid of tiny boxes meticulously restored to their accustomed places . <p> As he stood by she called the police  --  " I want to report a burglary . " Why not the police first ? she wondered later . Perhaps only that in a crisis one seeks loved ones first , then the duly constituted authorities  --  who may or may not be able to do anything . <p> While they waited they went through the house again , looking for a point of entry . They found two fine chisel marks at the edge of the back door  --  the door she had come through , not noticing . Her camera case was missing , too  --  the camera and lenses and instruction sheet removed and left on the closet floor . " For carrying the stuff away , " the policeman conjectured when he came . But no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the floor . Nothing to warn her as she sat talking on the phone or standing at the stove that something untoward and terrible had taken place . No premonitions either  --  some sense that she had better hurry home . No feeling when they emptied the dishwasher last night , or got out their breakfast silverware this morning , that this might be the last time they would see it . <p> WHEN AMANDA died , at 16 , there had been no warning . After it happened they had searched for predictive signs , and found a few . A week before she died , Amanda had said , looking down a long table at her mother , " I 've had a full life already . " That spring she had written a strange poem , about falling  --  which was how she had died , falling from a horse . Sarah clung to these with a desperate tenacity , as though if Amanda were fated to die it made her death less senseless and terrible . Amanda 's possible foreknowledge implied that at a higher level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could only take on faith now but which they would understand in some longed-for afterlife when they would be reunited with their daughter . Which , at that moment was the sole consuming need of faith  --  to believe in being reunited with Amanda . And her father , too , and Paul 's , and Toni and Nana and the other loved ones , now Saints in Glory , and with God or Christ or whoever was the available Heavenly Presence . But , most urgently , with Amanda . <p> She was glad the burglars had n't torn the house up , dumped everything on the floor or , perhaps worse , engaged in pointless vandalism  --  slashing paintings and upholstery , breaking glass  --  the anger in the universe run amok . Any witness to even fragments of order was a stay , something to cling to . She was somehow touched that they  --  or he , or she  --  had left the instruction sheet for the camera . It seemed almost kind . At least the burglars would make some use of their brazen act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Probably already melted it down . " <p> Did she yearn for it , her body hungering , her mind wandering into dark crevices , into pawnshops and trucks with built-in furnaces for easy disposal ? No , it was gone ; she did not , as she had with Amanda , play with the stopping of time , holding it back to the hour before her death in some effort to change the truth . Occasionally , wandering in antique malls , she thought to herself , " What if I saw my grandmother 's berry spoon , or the small teaspoons with George and Leon engraved in the handle , or Aunt Ellen 's emerald ring , or the demitasse spoons with my mother 's name ? " <p> Fortunately they had had appraisals made of the silver and jewelry . From the list she could easily conjure up each piece . But the burglary itself she had a hard time imagining . She could not seem to visualize an intruder standing in her dining room pleased to find an undeniably fine haul , then lifting from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoons and butter knives , and then , swift as night , finding their bedroom and collecting the best jewelry from all those tiny boxes and fitting the puzzle back together . Then , finding in another room the camera case on the closet floor and removing all its contents , stashing everything in it and walking , matter-of-factly , down the driveway . Then . . . where ? To the corner bus stop ? To a nearby parked car , to an accomplice who drove slowly by ? <p> She did have an image  --  borrowed only from a large , dark-eyed man who 'd come . several days earlier wanting to cut the grass . ( The police said that was often a way of checking whether anyone was home . ) Was that the man ? Had he come again to the front door and , no one answering his ring this time , gone to the tool shed to find some garden tools with which to spring loose the window lock for that , rather than the evidently failed attempt to open the back door , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it all , to purge herself of it  --  for she knew the wisdom of playing terrors through until you got used to them , somehow forced your psyche to accept them . She had learned that ten years ago , when it mattered more . <p> She had had a hard time forcing her mind to go through Amanda 's fall and , worse , the seconds before her fall , when the horse bolted and Amanda must have known she was in danger . <p> There were comforts , though  --  that Amanda 's death , since her brain was irreparably damaged , had come quickly . And that her brother , riding with her in the small group from the stable , had found her quickly , sat by her as they waited for the ambulance , laid his jacket over her , talked to her , patted her , though she was already unconscious . " I did n't want her to be alone , " he 'd said , and she , hearing , had wept with gratitude . He had done for Amanda what she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why she more than he ? He had done it well . We loved her . <p> USING THE appraisal sheets , they filled out the insurance forms , talked with the agent , agreed upon a settlement They had done that ten years ago . There 'd been a hint of negligence  --  the claim settled out of court , to pay for expenses , plus an additional sum , the designation of which she had mercifully forgotten . They had divided it among the family  --  " Do with it what you will . " <p> So much prudence . So much care . Immunizations against childhood diseases . Warnings about strangers . Talks about morality and religion . Music lessons . Time together . The investment of years . She remembered her mother 's words one day when her sister and brother and she were , in jest , congratulating their mother on how well they had all turned out . " You 'd better , " her mother had said . " You are my life 's work . " <p> The insurance money from the burglary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a rainy day ? Save it for their old age ? But many of the stolen things had been wedding gifts . It was not money to grow old on . The silver would have gone to their children . They had asked them , " Do you care about our replacing it for you ? " Modern young People , they had already chosen fine Swedish cutlery for their households . " No , " they said . <p> They would not replace it . " It 's only things , " she said again . They had a set of plated silver  --  previously stashed away against the possibility of more than 12 at the table . They bought some handsome stainless steel or everyday use , since they had used their silver every day . <p> She had walked through it endlessly , Amanda 's death , spent years at it , until the sharp teeth of its pain did not tear at her vitals . Had made herself able to go on with her life , be productive , even look into the shadowy unknown of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter  --  what she and her sisters had been for their mother . Amanda had had no sisters , only brothers . Fine men now , with fine wives . They would love each other , all of them , care for one another . But you could never assume ... <p> It was odd how the theft of the silverware and jewelry should swing it all into view again  --  like an afterthought , a small voice calling , some minor-league game . Nothing like Amanda 's death  --  she felt a pang of guilt again that she should associate them in any way with one another . It was blasphemy . Yet the syndrome had its macabre resonances  --  shock , denial , anger , sadness , acceptance . The mind 's penchant far returning to it in idle moments . <p> It was not the same at all , thank God . They had learned something over the past ten years , were learning it again , in terms that would not fell them this time . In terms they could , of all things , play with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for several evenings , they agreed on a trip to Europe , something they would n't have done otherwise . " Maybe the Orient Express , " she said , laughing . <p> They planned where to go , what to take . <p> In Venice , settling into their hotel room , she looked out at the red-tiled roofs  --  the buildings rising , astonishingly out of water  --  then back to the drawer where she was arranging her things . <p> Paul lounged on the bed , browsing through the guidebook . " Everything unpacked ? " he asked . " Ready to go out and look around ? " <p> " Almost , " she said , her hand lingering on the bright pink and purple satin cosmetic bag her daughter had given her many years age  --  the corded edges starting to fray now but the inside still intact  --  its hidden pockets just right for glosses and polish removers and fine perfumes . <p>
