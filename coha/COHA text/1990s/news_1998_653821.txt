<p> What 's in a name ? Increasingly for makers of generic drugs , everything  --  a seemingly odd state of affairs for an industry whose stock in trade is cheap no-name knockoffs of brands that have lost their patents . <p> With too many players in too many parts of the business , companies that primarily sell generics often find themselves lost in the crowd , able to stand out on pharmacy shelves only by cutting prices . More and more , though , they are replacing the identically drab scientific labels on their products with brand names of their own , raising prices in step with a higher profile . <p> " Everybody tries to undercut each other on price  --  it all becomes a high wire act , " said Allen Chao , the chief executive of Watson Pharmaceuticals , a generic drug maker based in Corona , Calif. , adding , " We decided the only way to deliver consistent earnings , quarter after quarter , was to go into the branded drug business . " <p> There have always been some brand names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its patent protection , one company gets the right to sell a generic version for about six months , after which others are allowed in . Some companies immediately put a brand name on that first version and back it with marketing to doctors and consumers . <p> But it is only lately that generics makers have begun to scramble for new ways to add names to their products . In some cases , analysts say , they have even tried to come in through the back door by giving an existing generic drug the kind of hold on a market that only a name brand would have . <p> Tired of waiting around for drugs to come off patent , Teva Pharmaceuticals U.S.A. , one of the nation 's largest generics makers , has begun to develop its own patented brands . Two years ago , the company rolled out Copaxone for multiple sclerosis and it now has 10 other products in the pipeline . Mylan Laboratories , another big generics maker , has six new drugs in development , including Sulfamylon , a burn medication . <p> Some companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Watson paid $290 million last year to acquire two lines of such drugs , including the oral contraceptive Trivora and Dilacor XR for hypertension . With the purchase , branded drugs are expected to contribute a little more than half of Watson 's estimated $550 million in sales this year , analysts say , up from nothing just three years ago . <p> And a few companies , like Mylan , have entered into exclusive agreements with the suppliers of chemicals and other raw materials for their drugs , arrangements that can have the effect of reducing the number of generics competitors . <p> In the case of lorazepam , an anti-anxiety drug , Mylan was able to reduce its top competitors largely to just Ativan , the original patented version by American Home Products . In February , after it had the field more to itself , Mylan raised the wholesale price of its version of lorazepam by 343 percent , to $796.67 for 1,000 pills , from $179.95 . The company attributed the jump to regulatory delays and legal fees from patent disputes , not to its arrangement with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have gone to other suppliers . <p> In any event , money is at the heart of the generic makers ' strategic shift . Branded drugs  --  whether patented original formulas or generics with names  --  boast profit margins of up to 70 percent or more , twice that of regular generics . <p> " It 's very important to have branded drugs in order to have sustainable margins , " said Thomas L. Anderson , president of the United States pharmaceutical division of Alpharma Inc. , the nation 's leading maker of generic liquid drugs . Alpharma started marketing its first branded generic in March . <p> The shift has largely escaped the notice of consumers , at least those who have insurance for prescription drugs or still have the option to use cheaper unbranded generics . But the sudden price increase of lorazepam and some other generics has upset pharmacists , who are unable to pass along the increases as quickly as they would like . It has also riled some members of Congress , who have called for investigations . <p> The biggest impact has been felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the stock price of both Watson and Mylan , for example , climbing more than 90 percent in the last year . <p> The generics companies that have changed at least some of their stripes say they had no choice . While most executives acknowledge that the generics industry can be enormously profitable , they also say that only a few companies ever share in the bounty . There are simply too many players in some categories , and landing the rights to be the first to make a generic version of a popular drug can often be troublesome . <p> Drug patents now last for 20 years . Yet by the time a company actually gets a drug to market , its patent has already largely expired , leaving it just eight years on average to be the lone seller . At the end of the patent period , companies often sue to protect their exclusivity by raising questions about the ability of generics makers to produce a safe substitute . Such a challenge can cost a generics maker millions of dollars in legal fees and lost revenues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and staff to fight a legal battle , " said Mr. Chao of Watson . " It 's been this way in the generics business for the past 15 years . " <p> Other market factors have lately made matters worse . The nation 's drug wholesalers have long complained that the generics industry  --  valued at $7.9 billion in the United States last year , or 8.4 percent of total drug sales  --  has too many players , creating inefficiencies and extra costs . In 1996 , several of the wholesalers  --  including the industry leaders Cardinal Health Inc. of Dublin , Ohio , and the McKesson Corporation of San Francisco  --  reduced the number of their so-called preferred suppliers , forcing many of the small manufacturers out of business . The carnage prompted many chief executives to quickly add some ballast to their bottom lines . <p> The alternative was to be caught in punishing price wars . Last year , for example , several of Teva 's rivals brought out their versions of clonazepam , an anti-convulsant generic that Teva had been the first to market . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dropped the price by 50 percent . When Teva 's parent , Teva Pharmaceutical Industries of Israel , announced a 20 percent decline in first-quarter earnings in May , company executives cited clonazepam as a prime cause . <p> Yet laying claim to a branded drug is neither easy nor inexpensive . <p> To roll out a new patented formula can cost $450 million to $600 million in research and development . ( Teva is spending less because of a sharing arrangement with some Israeli universities and hospitals . ) <p> To develop a branded generic , a company has to choose a drug that is technically difficult to reproduce , which will tend to narrow the number of possible competitors . <p> It also has to be prepared to back its new named version with a marketing campaign directed at doctors , who can specify a branded generic when writing a prescription . Anything with a name  --  which brings with it the implication of higher quality than something without one  --  can command a higher price . <p> Enough money is at stake to spark a controversy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplier . The Pittsburgh-based Mylan struck that deal shortly after the final quarter of 1997 , when 41 of its 97 generic drugs lost money . <p> The agreement with the supplier , which involved raw materials for several other generics besides lorazepam , gave Mylan " the majority of the market until competitors could catch up , " said Ian Sanderson of Cowen &; Company . " The company can triple sales from that drug , " he added , referring to lorazepam . <p> But the price increase  --  as well as similar increases by other generics makers , including Geneva Pharmaceuticals U.S.A. , a division of Novartis  --  was greeted by a nationwide chorus of criticism from independent pharmacists . It takes several weeks for insurers to alter their reimbursement schedules following price increases , the pharmacists complained , forcing them to absorb the difference in some cases . <p> Analysts said yesterday that the enormous price increase in lorazepam was largely responsible for the record 10.7 percent rise in the price of prescription drugs in May from a month earlier . Experts noted the Producer Price Index @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes it susceptible to sudden increases of a few products . <p> The flap also raised the ire of Representatives Pete Stark , a Democrat from California , and Marion Berry , a Democrat from Arkansas . Mr. Stark recently asked Attorney General Janet Reno and the Federal Trade Commission 's chairman , Robert Pitofsky , to review the price increases . So far , neither has responded . Mr. Berry , a former pharmacist , introduced a bill in May to create a commission to look into pricing . <p> " There have been all kinds of allegations that some of the generic makers have cornered the market on raw materials , " Mr. Berry said . " Well , we do n't know if that 's true or not . But it 's something that we need to know . " <p> Undoubtedly , Mr. Berry 's commission will stumble on one prime fact : at least some generics makers are not hurting for money . Thanks in part to their moves into name brands , earnings at Mylan increased 59.7 percent for the year ended in March , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent , to $103.1 million , excluding special acquisition costs . The performance of their stocks was even better . <p> For the last year , the kingpin stock among the big drug companies has been Pfizer 's . Propelled by Viagra , its now ubiquitous impotency treatment , Pfizer 's shares have risen 112 percent since May 1997 . But over the same period , Watson 's stock has increased 135 percent . <p> " Smaller companies can sometimes reward investors better than large firms because they start from a smaller base , " said David Saks , a managing director at Gruntal &; Company . " Most of the generic stocks have done great . A good , small , new , branded generic drug can be just as important to Watson as Viagra was to Pfizer . " <p> Teva Pharmaceutical Industries seems to be in line for such a boost because of its recent agreement with the Biovail Corporation International of Toronto to market several of its controlled-release drugs , including Procardia XL , a hypertension drug . Mr. Saks estimated the deal could add $1 annually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $1.95 a share last year . <p> Yet even with all these gains , none of the major generics makers are ready to abandon the product that made their name in the first place : cheap off-patent drugs . <p> For one thing , knockoffs are becoming more popular . Generic drugs now account for 42.1 percent of all dispensed prescriptions , up from 32.4 percent six years ago , according to I.M.S . Health , an industry consultant . For another , their ranks are going to swell in the next decade as branded drugs that now generate some $41 billion a year in revenues come off patent . These drugs include such superstars as Eli Lilly &; Company 's Prozac . <p> " Even with all the legal problems , there is still a lot of money to be made with generic drugs , " said William A. Fletcher , chief executive of Teva Pharmaceuticals U.S.A. , referring to the chance to be the first generic maker of an off-patent drug . " If it takes us six months or three years to get the rights to the generic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Standing Out From the Crowd " To differentiate themselves in a sea of cheap knockoffs of brand name drugs , some makers of generic drugs are adopting new business strategies , including developing brands of their own . WATSON Bought two lines of brand name generic drugs , including Dilacor , used to treat hypertension , and Zovia , an oral contraceptive . Dilacor had sales of $137.3 million in 1997 , 3.6 percent of that category . Zovia had sales of $11.8 million , a 0.8 percent market share . ALPHARMA Introduced Acticin , its first brand name generic , in 1997 . It is used to treat a skin disease . Mehta Partners estimates it will generate $10 million in sales this year , 11 percent of the market . TEVA Developing its own original patented drugs , starting with Copaxone , a treatment for multiple sclerosis . It had sales of $11.8 million in 1997 , 2.8 percent of the market .
