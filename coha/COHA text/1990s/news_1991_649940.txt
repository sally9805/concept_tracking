<p> A week of televised war has demonstrated the technical wizardry of the networks and CNN , the dedication of their correspondents , the glamour of high-tech combat and the armed forces ' skill at it  --  as well as the Pentagon 's controlling hand on information . <p> One consequence has been the emergence of a new kind of national hero  --  not a brave human being but a bloodless machine , the Patriot anti-missile missile . For probably the first time in history , the courage of men in battle was eclipsed  --  at least in the telling  --  by the radars and warheads they had fabricated . <p> Ultimately , however , evidence that humans are still the fodder and debris of war got past the Pentagon 's Big Brotherly pool reports . It was provided by Iraqi television , in its film of captured American and allied fliers forced into obviously false apologias . To at least one viewer 's eye , however , no dead bodies of any nationality have yet appeared on home screens . <p> To that same eye , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some unfortunate signals were discernible in the saturation coverage . Most obviously , by the end of the first week , the Pentagon was beginning to pull back from its glowing claims  --  necessarily unchallenged by free-ranging correspondents  --  of success in an air war apparently waged by magnificent flying machines against unmanned bunkers . <p> The retreat may have been too little , too late . It remains to be seen whether public opinion , conditioned in the first days to expect a quick , bloodless victory over unworthy opposition , will turn on its creators if a long , bloody ground war develops in the desert , or house-to-house in Kuwait City and Baghdad . <p> That is problematic . But other messages were conveyed or concealed in round-the-clock coverage featuring the optimistic assessments of retired generals and military-minded academics : <p> * In the unceasing barrage of deserved condemnation of Saddam Hussein , too little attention had been paid to his missile attacks on Israel  --  until yesterday 's deadly assault . Previously ineffective at the points of explosion and in the politics of the alliance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on all fronts , and to the bitter end . The attacks fulfilled his pledge to hit Israel , supported his pose as an Arab David against the Western Goliath and may yet hinder conduct of the war . They surely will complicate Israeli-Palestinian relations . <p> * No experts have been brought on to discuss the costs of Desert Storm  --  estimated at $2.5 billion a month when it was still Desert Shield  --  or the question of whether the same money , or some part of it , might not have been better used to meet U.S. domestic needs , from education to infrastructure , not to mention the deficit or the savings and loan scandal . Mayors , governors and university presidents all over the nation are scraping and cutting to make ends meet , while the richest nation in the world expends its wealth in pursuit of the second devilish dictator it has targeted for extinction in just over a year . <p> * Some but not enough notice has been taken of the fact that the victors of World War II are shedding blood and treasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japan , now the world 's most prosperous nations , neither of which shows much gratitude or mercy in trade relations , and both of which benefit from Mideast Oil more than do the U.S. , Britain and France . <p> * In the welter of self-congratulation , not only on seemingly quick victory but also on doing " what had to be done , " it seems largely to have been forgotten that U.S. troops originally were deployed to Saudi Arabia for strictly defensive purposes , that President Bush himself first proclaimed blockade and embargo as proper counters to Iraqi aggression , that these were in place for less than six months , that the U.S. pushed for the Security Council deadline now cited as having made war necessary , and that Mr. Bush demanded Iraq 's unconditional withdrawal from Kuwait  --  the equivalent of unconditional surrender  --  as the sole test of whether there would be war . <p> And who is talking , amid awed demonstrations of American technology and fervent paeans to immediate victory , about a settlement and the war 's aftereffects ? Will the Middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attuned to the West , once Western might has been asserted ? Will Israel be freer of threat , or the region 's oil flow unvexed to the world ? These questions , all discussed too little if at all , seem as relevant as the latest pinpoint bombing strike , and more important .
