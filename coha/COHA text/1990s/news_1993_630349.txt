I plan to prepare a panel with acrylic gesso and some modeling paste to increase absorbency so it will be more like a traditional gesso . Is this a good surface for oils , or would you use an alkyd primer ? If so , how long does the alkyd primer need to dry before I can paint on it ? A mixture of 3 parts gesso to 1 part modeling paste makes a very good ground for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would also make a good ground for a flexible support such as canvas with the addition of a dollop of gel medium to increase the flexibility of the modeling paste , which is brittle . An alkyd primer also produces a functional ground . It is flexible , nonyellowing , and quick drying and can be painted on after only 24 hours . Explaining Underpainting Can you please explain the underpainting process ? An underpainting is the layer ( or layers ) of paint underneath the overpainting , or final paint layer , and therefore it requires more than one painting session . The simplest underpainting is a toned ground or a colored canvas , which affects the development of the painting differently from a white canvas . A medium-toned ground , which is quite good for a portrait , looks something like the natural color of linen and is achieved with mixtures of burnt umber or raw umber plus white . If you add a bit of Prussian blue these tones become cooler . For a dark-toned ground the most common colors are Venetian red , burnt umber , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using a variety of contrasting colors that is overpainted using complementary colors creates interesting effects . Another type of underpainting is a grisailk , which derives its name from the French word gris , meaning gray . In a grisaille a variety of grays , either cool or warm , are used to indicate the lights and darks that will be developed in the overpainting , which might simply consist of transparent colored paint layers . In underpainting technique it is important to keep the contours of forms soft and blended , because they are difficult to blend after the fact , and also to allow for some freedom in developing the finished painting . Causes of Cracking I own an old painting that has suddenly become very cracked . I thought I had stored it safely . What are the possible causes of this ? There are numerous causes of cracks in paintings , including the following : exposure to intense sunlight or artificial heat ; using a nonabsorbent ground or a canvas that has no tooth ; too much glue in the gesso ground or the size ; applying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of according to the golden rule , of fat over lean ; applying paint over an underpainting or ground that is not thoroughly dry ; using a canvas that is too thin for the load of paint applied ; or failing to allow enough drying time between superimposed layers of paint . Priming Linen With Acrylic Gel Medium Can linen be primed with acrylic gel medium ? Yes , you can use a transparent protective coating , such as acrylic gel medium , in place of acrylic gesso or hide glue and a white oil compound , and it will preserve the intrinsic beauty of the linen textile . Since paint must penetrate into the ground in order to adhere permanently to canvas , it is advisable to apply two thin coats of gel medium . Priming provides a receptive and workable surface , called a ground , for the painting medium . If the weave of the canvas is very open or if the initial application of the priming is too heavy , the priming is likely to seep through the weave of the canvas in places , creating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strike-through , the seeping of the paint into the canvas . A good way to prevent strike-through is to push acrylic gel medium into the fibers of the canvas with a stiffbrush . This acts as a size and provides a superior layer for priming with acrylic " gesso " - although that gesso , a white latex paint , does not require a size . In the traditional method of oil priming , the size is hide glue and the ground is a compound of lead white ground in linseed oil . They are applied in separate layers . The size coat acts as an isolation layer between the canvas and the ground , protecting the textile fibers from the ground .
