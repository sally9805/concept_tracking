As a poet , you would expect him not only to ask but to answer . <p> " How do we know the agenda of love ? ' he asks and elaborates , " If you expose the heart , it can split wide open .

His wife pulls out the chair to make more room as he tries again . <p> " I 'll bring you a snack , my dear , " she says , " and juice to go with the little pill . " <p> He spills the glass of juice . The pill floats in the orange juice . <p> " I 'll find a double-handled cup , " she says . " Better to hold on to . " <p> " Forget the cup . " He 's cranky . " Give me lox . " <p> " No salt for you , " she tells him regretfully . <p> " Herring ! " His soft voice is raised . <p> " Salty , " she says . " Toasted challah ?

Even though it 's warm in the apartment , he pulls the down quilt up over his jacket , sweater , shirt , and tie . <p> " Once we discussed the possibilities of mankind , " he says and yawns , " the ... endless .. , possibilities .

He , leaning heavily on her arm , will walk the two blocks to the park and sit under the purple jacaranda trees . He may or may not notice the infants digging in the sandbox at his feet . if she takes him to a movie , he sleeps and awakens wondering about the looming images in the dark . <p> " The only problem is , " she says , " that he sleeps twenty hours out of twenty-four . Those four hours have to count . " <p> Attention " Koochie-koo , " says the eighty five year-old cousin . " Peek-a-boo .

We had frequent meals at her home or mine . Our fingers interlocked as we spoke intimately of our days . I thought we would never untwine our hands . We spoke jokingly of being roommates in an old folks ' home . <p> Now her gesture is forbidding , her eyes unfamiliar . She has pushed me away from her life . <p> " We 're through . " <p> So fast are people finished if they are in different places . <p> I had sinned , though it had felt like a triumph . I had climbed up the ladder in the world of literature . And she , older and heavier than I , was still struggling at a lower rung . <p> Silence I see a friend across the street and wave .

The dangers are indicated in the etymology of agenda : agitation , intransigency , ambiguity , litigation . Even navigation and transaction , indicating separate paths , are causes for rejection . One must not differentiate one 's self from others . <p> The Funeral I paused at the door of the memorial . Her family and affinity groups were here  --  her writing group , her dreaming group , her antiwar group , her Monday night women 's eating group . <p> There was a coolness in the air . Relationships were encoded . We addressed one another and awaited the reply before deciding how to respond : a small nod of the head to a hesitant remark , aggressing with gesture and speech to a larger effort on the part of others . <p> Going from " Hello " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in effect . <p> If you had fallen into or remained in obscurity , you were avoided , bad luck to others who , after seeing you , would know they would have a harder time in the world of commerce . The Untouchables still had their dreams , their writing , art , acting selves were eagerly there , but not important to anyone else . <p> All of us , until the rentals were impossible in the city , tried to live where curators could visit our studios , or agents be consulted and writers ' meetings attended . Some had to be up for early morning auditions . One trained in from Coney Island and had to spend the day wandering the city , between appointments , before she could return to the isolated apartment with the affordable rental . <p> A few still have a bit of luck : a painting in a group exhibition , a small part in an off-Broadway show , a story that wins a minor prize .

They are part of The In-Group of talented writers , hanging out , hanging around the theater , all going to the same analyst . Their words , still freshly lisped , are taken for wisdom . Those still in their teens put out zines , their own pubs . <p> The tougher , older group on the other side of the church pew were gathered nearer to the coffin . <p> Our last group photo was a few years ago , at a rally . Some recited poetry , read short pieces of fiction at that rally . For them , it was their last public performance . <p> When we looked across the church to the younger group , more than generation separated us . Success or lack of it were deeper . <p> The funeral was informal , as befits the passing of an activist , but also surprisingly stately , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services . The only curious thing was that the deceased had been Jewish . <p> Everyone was there , decades of everyone from the West Village . We bad run the gamut from activism to idleness , Stalinism to capitalism , hippie on the commune to head of the PTA . The arts had also changed , the painters , once the Abstract Abstractionists of the early fifties , had gone back to the figure , the political writers had turned to romance . <p> She , the deceased , in the sixties had been humiliated publicly but later spoke proudly of that time . She had been arrested for protests , had borne a child and reared him alone , had lived in a cold-water flat . She lived a split life innately elegant while radical ; her hair coiffed , clothing fitted  --  as she learned to sew  --  while her voice shrilled at the police , or she picketed in front of City Hall or the downtown Federal Building . <p> Now , lying with hands folded , nothing was out of place in her appearance .

She was partly an underground figure : having driven cars of war protesters , escapees across the New York-Canadian border at Niagara or Buffalo . She lived largely a private life , almost underground , unless one read the early mimeographed magazines of the movement , or drank in the West Village bars . No one ever saw her lovers , for they visited her clandestinely while her child slept . <p> When she was not at a meeting , she visited her friends one at a time . One friend had a view of the Statue of Liberty from her apartment window . She began to think of herself as unstatuesque in contrast , full-bosomed but slight , narrow in the hips and ankles , thin nose , delicate arms incapable of holding up lanterns or torches . <p> But she was a lit-up person , the skin luminous , the hair richly white and wavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close deaths in the family seemed of some fine material wrapped around her . <p> I spoke . <p> " I have heard a scientist speak of Niches of Sound , that he discovered every creature , mammal , insect , bird , has its own niche .

She is an extinct species . " <p> Enemies Does one have more enemies in New York than in New Jersey or Massachusetts ? I asked a famous writer . <p> She nodded . <p> The wrestling of the dinosaur egos , she said . The ground trembles as if all the subways were running on the same tracks . <p> A heavy-bodied woman with hair once black and now shoepolished comes by giving us dirty looks , to me rather than to my more famous friend , for I can do her no harm and my friend could , if she wished . <p> A thin graying person comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

" said a former friend whom I had known for fifteen years . " You harmed my career . " <p> But she was an artist . I could not possibly harm her career . Her own vision had harmed it long ago . <p> But here I stand , smiling tightly at some of the funeral-goers , turning carefully away from others , all of us mourning and reflecting and being part of a congregation in an Episcopalian church . <p> History We had known each other from the early 1950 's . <p> Some of my friends were at Atelier 17 on E. 8th Street , where Bill Hayter greeted Anais Nin and Dylan Thomas and , after the long hours of printing editions on the etching press , everyone went to The White Horse Tavern . There , we helped drink Dylan to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over Dylan , blond and beautiful . His nose , by now , was pocked , his stomach bloated , and his eyes bleary , but he had a yen for Anita . " Come to me , Anita ! " " Forget it , " said Anita and turned her back on him . <p> " I have fucked bigger women than you , " he shouted , " and flung them over the cliff : ' <p> I had never heard fuck ' before . It tasted salty in my mouth . <p> They both died soon afterward , Anita and Dylan , separately and of different causes , the sober Anita of leukemia , Dylan of the ravages of drink . <p> In those days we were strong . The artists had muscles from <p> grinding ink . We were , in that atelier in the postwar fifties , racially and sexually mixed : urban black woman and Southern gay guy who started a printing press ; refugees from Hitler who returned to Europe with Hayter when the INS began investigating them for being " premature anti-fascists . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living in cold-water flats but training or continuing in our careers . Others were middle-class , coming down from the Upper East Side . We were famous  --  our diaries bestsellers . Or not . We were the beginning of the people we were going to he . <p> Were there politics then ? Mostly art politics . I was taking poetry classes at NYU at night with Allen Tate , the thin , elegant , elderly poet with a thing for young girls . I was so impressed by him that I could hardly believe it was he who said the words " niggers , " " fags , " " kikes . " <p> None of ' those groups would win poetry awards from the committees on which our prestigious teacher served . <p> Still in Those Days I watched Hayter helping a young artist , a fellow tall , gangly from no regular food , but gently handsome . <p> " How did you print this etching ? " he asked the young man . " It 's very pale . " <p> " With a spoon " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at my school . " <p> " You son-of-a-gun ? Hayter took the large zinc plate , inked it , covered it with a printer 's blanket , and put it through the rollers . " Do n't you know an etching goes through an etching press ? " He looked at the young man wearing cotton pants in winter . " Come join the shop . " <p> The fellow had no money , no job . <p> " It so happens , " said Hayter , " I know of a fellowship , if you want to be the super and clean up the place . " <p> The fellowships at the atelier were out of Hayter 's pocket , as were the steins of beer late at night , as were the stories . <p> Some went to the Cedars Bar  --  the Hans Hoffman people . But we were The White Horse Tavern crowd . Late one night , after printing , the group walked westward to the White Horse , only to find its owner , Ernie , with his teeth knocked out . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A drunken cop , " said Ernie . <p> We whistled . It was the fifties . Who ever heard of such a thing ? <p> We writers and artists lived any way we could . Those in the Village , like a filmmaker , became the caretakers of the building . Some of us lived Midtown , in the shadow of Bellevue Hospital , still on DC current . We had a cold-water flat , the walls plastered so unevenly we painted them black . Above our heads was a metal molding ceiling that we painted lavender . The place was small . The oil paintings dried under the bed , and turpentine was our perfume . <p> If we went for a walk towards the East River , along Bellevue , when the mental wards were out getting the air , we were cursed until we fled . That was unusual in those days , to be raged off the street , though ordinary enough now to pass the fulminating person . <p> Time The years went by . <p> First she was walking , then stumbling , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liquid through a straw . Later she was fed through tubes . <p> She had been handsome , charismatic . Students came those first years , still bringing manuscripts for her comments . All but the firmest of friends were frightened by the later years  --  the unrecognizable , bloated face , the lumpy body , the voice that sounded palsied . But she could still point a finger at an offensive paragraph , an infelicitous expression . She could make a face when the work did n't work at all . <p> Her critical judgment lasted until the last day , when she blinked her eyes , looked deeply into those of her caretaker/lover . He helped her shut her lids . He removed all the tubes . To his surprise , she smiled and slept and slipped past him . <p> Appreciation His shirt has just returned from the cleaner 's , starched and pressed . He wears a tie this day . He wears soft leather loafers . Everything matches  --  the green-gray pants , the brown shirt , the brown and red tie , the cordovan loafers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . <p> He smiles . His smile is not so broad as once it was , before the illness . <p> He walks towards her , one side slower than the other . <p> She reaches out her hands . He is her great love . <p> Gender The little golden-haired girl asks , " Do you love me more than the mountains ? Do you love me more than the sun ? Do you love me more than God ? " <p> The grandmother is in the language of a fairy tale . <p> Her other grandchild , a raven-haired eight-year-old boy , informs her , " I won the spelling bee , spelling two words , s-c-i-e-n-c-e and m-a-t-h-e-m-a-t-i-c-s . " <p> He is spelling out his future work . <p> Alone The squares on the calendar are empty . If the phone rings , sometimes she lets it ring . The answering machine is broken . <p> " Why should I pay to fix it , " she asks , " when it costs as much to fix as to buy a new one ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Her hair becomes dry , without conditioner or beauty salon . <p> When she 's cold she wears the lining of old coats over her clothes . <p> She does not read the newspaper . She has forgotten to pay the delivery bill . <p> She has valuable artwork but has forgotten the names of the artists . <p> If you manage to reach her , she is delighted to hear from you . <p> " Where have you been ? " she accuses . <p> But when you make an appointment to see her , she is not at home . <p> You wait in her lobby . Eventually she returns . You ask , " Where were you ? " She pauses , then , " I do n't remember . " <p> No one asks her how she is anymore . <p> The professional organizations have dropped her from their mailings . The catalogues have ceased coming . Record companies do not send out their releases . Lincoln Center has dropped her from its list of prized subscribers . <p> Yet , she has plans . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Switzerland and then hear Mozart in Austria . I have friends around the world . <p> " But the world has forgotten to befriend her . <p> " I ca n't afford my life ! " she cries . " Who can live on Social Security ?

In the meantime , how do I live ? " <p> Once she had respect , a house in the Hamptons , an apartment on Park Avenue , a large dog , and , every winter , with her partner , a spa in Mexico . <p> Even in her late middle years , she swam strongly . She built furniture for her summer house . She cooked for huge parties of theater people . <p> Her body is not swimming or cooking or walking the Labrador retriever . Her body bloats , her gait is unsteady . Her face and arms are swollen and discolored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her forget the long winter . <p> Someone has already been there , presenting her with a cuddly plush toy dog . <p> She laughs delightedly . <p> " You adorable creature : ' She buries her face in it . <p> She is in love . <p> She dreams of feeding the cocker spaniel , of ringing for the elevator , the dog impatient as the car descended , and then , when the doors opened , straining , running at the end of its leash down the street , she in tow . <p> Memory She spoke at his funeral . The coffin had been closed , and she remembered out loud . <p> She remembered his childhood , his short stature so that he determined to be a basketball player and run between the legs of the giants . She spoke of the accent he developed at home , so that he determined to go into theater and speak in many accents . She spoke of his dark coloring and how he had bleached his brilliant black hair a yellow-white . <p> " He was a person in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she told the mourners . <p> She looked around . Former lovers were there , still resentful of her . A brother could not accept their having lived together for all those years . Her parents still wrote to her old separate address because they had never married . <p> But it was her duty to remember him with love . <p> " He found people on the street and invited them indoors and taught them how to work . He found people who were agoraphobic and never went outdoors , and he taught them to jog , bike , and skateboard indoors and , gradually , outside . <p> " He found children failing classes , and he talked to them until they were convinced that they could think . He found old people with no one to advocate for them , alone all day , and he made phone visits at the same time every Sunday . And then he told them to dress up for the phone call , that it was like a real visit . Then he told them to initiate the calls to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to visit him . And they did . <p> " He found himself , not nearly the man he wanted to be  --  a lover of music who could not sing on-key , a reader of poetry who could not memorize a line , an aficionado of literature who could not write a sentence . And he had to remake that unsatisfying person until the air sparkled around him when he talked and students wrote down his words , until he spoke so poetically that composers made music of his sayings . " <p> She looked around the room . A little girl was crying , either from the stuffy room or because her father had tears on his cheeks . <p> The last thing she had to say was the hardest . <p> " l have to live . " <p> The mail still came for him . The bills still had to be paid for his lingering illness . The phone rang from former patients who had not been informed . <p> And she could not separate herself from the connection . She touched the coffin lightly . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Chinese urn . She would meditate , pray , speak to the vase . She knew the bits of bone would rattle , the ashes gradually would leak through . He would find a way to come to her . <p> Pastoral Visit The minister of a large house of worship is besieged by requests for visits and consultations . This is in addition to scheduling weddings , funerals , and attendance at hospitals . <p> The loyal secretary is fielding phone calls . How many sore hearts can be eased ? How many egos expanded ? One must choose , she feels , which disconsolate or even desperate person can be uplifted ? <p> Oh , says a minister , what does this have to do with God , with the Bible , with all the Commentaries ? <p> But then the guest chair is filled , and the congregant makes herself/himself known from among those in the crowded pews . The person speaks hesitantly or in a monologue to describe a life with drama , melodrama , or even that is colorless . <p> The head of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> One congregant speaks of caring for a severely disabled son into the teenage years , of being able to leave the house only for a few hours a week . A visitor is living with mental illness which uses all his energies to appear sane , to hold a job , to attend a class , and there is nothing left to give another . Or even one 's self . A third visitor describes the slow decline of a loved person whose history has altered from energetic to wheelchair-confined , from charismatic to mute . There is even one who is heartbroken because decades-long friendships have ended in bitter quarreling and there is no way to recover one 's past . And she is too advanced in years to make a new history of friendship . <p> Then the ministering person may touch the congregant 's hand , or , if more restrained , holds on to the edge of the desk to stop from leaping up with emotion . The minister may press his or her hands together , as if piously , but chiefly to keep them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> What does one person do with another 's life ? <p> Where is God ? Or does that not matter ? <p> Even the congregants are unsure of what they want . Is it to be blessed ? Forgiven ? Understood ? <p> At that point it helps if the ministering person remembers a story recorded by a Sage . He tells the parable : <p> " There is a singer whose soft voice can not be heard . Another singer , with a more powerful voice , lifts the melody , and , between them , the song soars " <p> At the end of this pastoral call , our turmoil is calmed . That is , if our aria is heard . <p> Geography of Love There are whole blocks in the Village that are dangerous . I have memories of restaurants where we met , of street corners where we gathered signatures for petitions , of markets where we shopped together or the greengrocer-farmers ' stands at Grosvenor 's Square on Saturday mornings where we selected our vegetables for near-wholesale prices . <p> There are sections of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the pleased smile , now turned to disappointment at suddenly meeting one another 's eyes . There was the expectation of a good conversation over tea and canoli at the Italian restaurant where operas filled the air . Now I see her there , sitting near the window , toying with the salt and pepper shakers . <p> If we could only honor our past , hand each other on to the next era with good wishes , the heart would ease . <p> But there is no closure to separated friendship , for our lives go in parallel lines  --  she up Ninth Avenue , I down Sixth Avenue , the avenues never converging . <p> Funeral We die before we die . <p> Someone near  --  our child , our lover  --  has gone and then we disappear a little . We reach out , trying to grab on to them but thin air greets us . <p> The stairs from her walk-up seem steeper , the weather chillier . She bundles up in a winter coat though it 's spring . <p> Her will has become will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her appointed meeting , she begins to lag , arrives late , missing everyone . Soon no one expects her on time . No one expects her to participate in the latest protest , the most recent government 's capitulation to capitalism . <p> She is still so neat in appearance , cutting her hair carefully , her skirts taken up or let down as style demands . Her nails are buffed , covered with Pearl , lipstick matching the subtle polish on the nails . <p> Inside her , there is a colorful growth , foreign cells inhabiting the organs . The only outward sign is a polite cough , her posture stooped . <p> From someone who inserted herself so seriously onto this earth , who proclaimed her stance from every podium , she breathed more pantingly until she quietly exhaled her last . <p> The death became a problem to some because of what was unfinished : the prologues to pamphlets , the ending of a piece of fiction , the pile of rejected manuscripts . Who could simply leave those manuscripts in their manila envelopes to gather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executor , in that non-hierarchical group ? Which one would continue submitting her work , monitoring rejections , cross-indexing stories and magazines ? <p> Would her voice , now interrupted , be totally stilled ? <p> At the funeral is a reading . Each old friend reads a paragraph from one of her books , or a story , or recites a political manifesto . New friends , young women , reminisce about her beautiful white hair , her clothing French-seamed , the shoes she selected with care from the bargain stores . They spoke of her library visits , her memorizing poems , the eloquence of her speech . She taught them to live with elegance and an empty purse . <p> And around the coffin are the photographs of the group , some newspaper shots  --  all of us alive , and in front of a draft board protesting  --  thirty years ago . Most of us picketing Wall Street at an almost action . Some of us were doing passive resistance , carried onto a paddy wagon while the stockbrokers jeered . <p> Decades later , we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in solidarity with the one of us who was arrested in a D.C. march . The Times never put us or our beliefs on page one , but , deep inside the paper , we are shown in chilly winter , in that square in front of the massive building , unrecognizable within our caps , scarves , mittens , behind our signs . <p> Perhaps it was the pressure of the outside world that kept us together , this affinity group . <p> When that style of politics went out , we were , in a way , unemployed . <p> She , lying there on the bier , is an activist at rest . <p> We , from opposite sides of the room , are now in opposition to one another . <p> Marriage I know about married love , the shared calendars , the separate weekly reminders . <p> I know about sitting on a love seat , the arm pieces carved like bookends . <p> I know about photo albums and seeing the pictures of my parents tipped in , from the time my father was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horn-rimmed glasses .

Even in that black-and-white photo , his hair could have been red . He was a farmer who met the dark gypsy . <p> Our parents age in the photo album . It takes until her seventies for his mother 's hair to whiten . The father 's hair , for some time dyed red so he can appear younger as he applies for factory work , is no longer an issue . He has died younger than he or the family expected . <p> My father 's bushy hair settles softly around his head , while my mother takes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the end , both are white-haloed , a deep wave of hair over my father 's eyes .

Her eyes , once large and gray , have become hooded . <p> But when they sit together , they smile with closed lips , their eyes crinkling at each other . They are one another 's wrinkles , crinkles , smiles , worried frowns , swollen knuckles . <p> So you see , long-lasting love is natural to me . <p> I know the physicality , the geometry of it . <p> He is on my wall in his sailor suit , four years old . I am next to him , framed , hand-colored yellow bow above long curls , hands primly together in the lap of the colored yellow dress . <p> These framed children will grow up and meet and each help the other grow older . <p> A Mother 's Love She tells him everything he needs to know as he grows : what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Then they rebuild together . <p> She tells him stories about the father he 's never seen , an adventurous man , who traveled , entered every fray , and was killed in battle . <p> He wants to be just like his father . <p> But , in the meantime , he has eczema and asthma . His problems require a satchel full of medication wherever he travels . <p> He has trouble with building one thing atop of the other . <p> How can he possibly go into battle ? <p> And which battles should he choose ? <p> What the mother has not told her beloved , her only son , is that she has made up his father . <p> If she told him , the boy 's dreams would have to alter .

The tongue stayed twisted . The body could not raise or lower itself . <p> She had a way of laughing , of coughing , turning her head , banging it . <p> Her language was movement , a throat cleared , a bark , snuffle , cough . <p> For two decades they spoke to her , dressed her ( " Which dress ? " She turns her head . " This dress ? " She smiles ) and wheeled her chair into the sun . <p> In the courtyard , perhaps she would sprout or rise from the chair or sing like the creatures among the leaves . <p> She turned her face upwards . She smiled . She coughed or laughed . That was her vocabulary . <p> They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stories she would have written . <p> And , thus blessed , what was broken was made whole . <p> Their heads bent above her , elicited sound , something like whistling or trilling , climbing up the scale of love . <p> They make stories of her sounds . It is the book they daily read . <p> Analytical Love He was a different kind of therapist . He was on her side , all the way . <p> " What did your former friend do to you ? " he asked . " She stopped loving me . " <p> " Anything else ? " <p> " She spoke against me : ' <p> " I 've seen her around , " he said . " She lives in my building . I 'll snarl at her in the elevator . " <p> She grins . An advocate helps one to heal . <p> Loss " Do n't let your husband and children take advantage of you , " her friend told her . " Do n't let this friend or that get the better of you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her friend monitored the world around her . <p> " Do n't take politics more seriously than people " her friend advised , " and look behind you all the time to see what people are doing . " <p> Then , one day , she was behind me glaring , tramping on the back of my heels . <p> I was no longer to be cared for , or with her , to he a discussant on my life . <p> A seat was missing in the auditorium . <p> A card was absent at holiday times . <p> Someone was not there with the pot at potluck . <p> When the party photographs were taken  --  at birthdays , anniversaries , children 's parties  --  she is not in the background , candles gleaming in her eyes . <p> She is not in love with me . <p> The Ologists There is an assassinologist who founded an Assassin Museum in Texas . <p> My doctor for serious matters is a cardiologist . I love the cardiologist . He keeps my heart pumping , and I send him Valentine 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a broken heart . <p> There are garbologists , such as the one who went through the garbage of Bob Dylan . <p> There are herbologists who will alter our skin tone and keep us tony . <p> This is the Giftologist , says the sign on a Broadway store . <p> From the assassin of the heart , from the heart 's healer , from the mess of our lives and the savory herbs that disguise it , from our wrapped and unwrapped presents to one another , we compose our songs . <p> The Boyish Man I love him . <p> Once there was a man who had been a boy and was still boyish . There was such tenderness in him that he went into Central Park to feed the homeless young people , to invite them to his room , to council them , to tutor them . <p> Sometimes he became one of the homeless , wandering without address , calling from a corner phone , blaming the past and those who bore him and who grew up with him . <p> When you speak to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colors that burn with intensity , sounds that startle like honking truck horns , that it seems as if you were speaking from a wind tunnel , roaring into his ears . <p> And yet , when he can quiet himself , he goes to the Library of Judaica and uses the computers . Like a Kabbalist he studies the mystical numbers of math and hopes for a spell that can cure pain and danger and homelessness . <p> He is aging and not aging , growing older and not going anywhere . And yet , like honey , his sweetness spreads among the innocents in the park . <p> Between There is a man of strength and presence , a person of dignity and quiet demeanor . But when he raises his hand with his painting brush a wildness appears . On canvas , planes explode , people jettison into space . Or he sits before a glass table with his watercolor box . A choreography occurs as his creations , like feathers , float between heaven and earth , tumbling , crouching , separated or touching , hair spreading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a hell or are they only birdlike on currents of air ? <p> This man is between this time and another , like his people , floating , stumbling as his stance is less steady , trembling a bit , but steady in his life , blameless in his character . <p> And she , connected to him , what will she be , bound and unbound ? <p> The Only Agenda Her poet friend had told her it would be this way . You love until there is no breath left . You love until you pant with it . <p> " All that has breath loves you , " we praise the One Above . <p> You love and breathe in that love , that life , that joy , that separation , that madness and illness . You breathe it in until you labor with breathing , you choke with asthma . <p> Somewhere in that parade of beloveds and enemies , of one 's family and friends , one searches the self . There may be no love she has left for herself . <p> She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell her . But when her life becomes like a playground , full of fretful pullings and hittings , she forgets her plots . <p> She is between work and exhaustion ; between imagination and dull fact . <p> When do the people return to the page ? When do the angels surround her , soundproof her space , before her , behind her , so that her words , with no one else 's accent , flow ? <p> There is no room for tenderness or tiredness or playfulness . The only use for the sore heart is as reference . <p> The poet is partially wrong . A novelist could tell him that work is also on the agenda . <p> <p> By E. M. BRONER <p>
