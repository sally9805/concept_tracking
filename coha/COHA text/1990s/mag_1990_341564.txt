" A worn-out old phonograph record " whose potential as a political leader is " not great , " snapped Mikhail Gorbachev . An " indecisive . . . master of half measures , " countered Boris Yeltsin . That was the kind of gibe the Soviet Union 's two leading politicos had been exchanging in three years of unabated rivalry . Last week they decided to cooperate : Gorbachev and Yeltsin agreed to set up a commission to frame a relatively radical plan for introducing a market economy . Said Nikolai Petrakov , a Gorbachev adviser and member of the 13-man panel : " This is the most important information of 1990 . " <P> While details of the agreement were not revealed , it appeared that Yeltsin , who was elected chairman of the Russian republic 's parliament in May , had won a round .

Before Sept. 1 , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the committee is to work out a plan for drafting a law to establish a market ecomomy . <P> The loser last week was Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov , whose more conservative scheme for a gradual switch to a market economy  --  to be achieved over a period of two years  --  was rejected by parliament in June . According to rumors , Ryzhkov was so disappointed at being bypassed on the commission that he refused to sign the document that created it .
