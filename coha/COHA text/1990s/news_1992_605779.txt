<p> On the same morning last December that Palestinians in coats and ties were due to meet Israelis in Washington to talk about peace , others back home in the West Bank village of Beit Iqsa stood half-naked under the barrel of an Israeli soldier 's gun in a very different kind of encounter . <p> Soldiers had seized a group of 20 young Palestinians returning from a nonviolent protest over land confiscation and ordered them to strip off their shirts . For 40 minutes on a cold and rainy day , they were forced to stand against a stone wall , hands tied behind their backs , while the soldiers searched and mocked them . <p> In the larger scheme of war and peace in the Middle East , it was just another minor , unsanctioned indignity for which an army sergeant was later disciplined . But in its crude way , the incident touched on issues and emotions  --  power , pride and humiliation  --  that lie at the heart of the conflict between Arabs and Jews . They comprise the unspoken , non-negotiable agenda of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggle between Israelis and Palestinians . But it is also a very personal encounter between two sets of people who , despite decades of contact and confrontation , do not know each other very well but fear each other intensely . It is the accumulation of thousands of incidents  --  large and small , earth-shaking and trivial , achingly complicated and brutally simple . Together they form a vast mountain of anger , damage and dread that could easily bury the fragile , halting process underway in Washington . <p> " Between an Israeli Jew and a Palestinian Arab , there are numerous immediate , gut-wrenching issues that cry out for resolution , " said Palestinian lawyer Jonathan Kuttab . " We ca n't meet only as citizen to soldier , lawyer to lawyer , employer to employee and pretend that the big situation does n't exist . " <p> The soldiers who harassed the Palestinians that morning have not commented about it . But Tamar Peleg , an Israeli civil rights lawyer who is one of the few people who move regularly between the two communities , said such acts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to people who do n't exist to them , who are n't real , " she said of the security forces , " to people we do n't know and to a community where the only thing we know about them is that they hate us . " <p> For the most part , Israelis and Palestinians live totally separate lives . Although Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir 's government claims to have abolished the " Green Line " between Israel and the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip , the border still exists in the minds of people on both sides of it . Except for soldiers and Jewish settlers , most Israelis never venture into the territories  --  and the only Palestinians who cross over regularly into Israel are the 80,000 to 100,000 who work there and return home each night . <p> Yet they claim the same land , share the same home . Each defines the other as an alien intruder and a threat  --  as an enemy , not as a neighbor  --  and each people sees the other solely through the prism of its own history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Israelis by Arab radicals in the occupied territories , an 18-year-old East Jerusalem activist named Radwan said , " They were settlers , were n't they ? That makes them soldiers , does n't it ? If they die , so what ? " <p> Similarly , when asked to describe Rachel Druck , a friend who had been killed in an ambush by Palestinian gunmen , an Israeli woman at the West Bank settlement of Shiloh first had a question : " I want to know if you are going to write only about Rachel or will your article mention Arabs who have died as well . " Juxtaposing Jewish and Arab deaths in such a way would be false , she insisted , " because we are right and they are wrong . " <p> This series of articles on three of the world 's most protracted ethnic conflicts has examined Northern Ireland , where the low-grade war between Protestants and Catholics has become an accepted , even routine part of the status quo , and South Africa , which is living through a dangerous and chaotic interregnum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domination . <p> Israel is hovering somewhere in between  --  poised uneasily between the fledgling peace process in Washington and the darker , more brutal process of human erosion back home . It is a pivotal moment in Israeli history , a time when both sides are taking another wary look at each other  --  and at themselves . The Myth of Coexistence <p> When Israeli columnist Zeev Chafets worked for Israel 's Foreign Ministry 15 years ago , he helped put together a glossy brochure on Israel 's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza . It showed photographs of Arabs and Jews working side by side in factories , shopping in open markets and sharing sunshine at the beach . The title was " Coexistence . " <p> In those days there were two kinds of Palestinians , said Chafets . The " bad " Palestinians , who lived out of the country , belonged to the Palestine Liberation Organization and staged terrorist raids into Israel . But the " good " Palestinians worked in Israel , appreciated their new higher standard of living and came to know and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chafets now concedes , is that it was never much more than a figment of liberal imagination . Arabs and Jews never came to know , let alone admire , each other . If anything , the limited contact between the two groups in the unequal power relationships of occupier and occupied , employer and employee tended to draw out the differences between them . <p> Palestinians who ventured into Israel to work often learned Hebrew and developed some sense of what Israelis were like . But it was , many complained , a one-way street that led nowhere . " We know a lot about them , but they know nothing about us , " said Nizzam Bani Shamseh , 32 , a resident of the West Bank village of Beita who worked for several years for Israeli construction firms . <p> After Israeli police and Palestinian demonstrators clashed on Jerusalem 's Temple Mount a year ago and 21 Arabs were shot dead , a number of Palestinians retaliated with knife attacks on Jews inside Israel proper . At the same time , stories abounded of Arab construction workers damaging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in processing plants urinating in food vats . Virtually all the perpetrators were workers from the territories who were familiar faces in Israel  --  the very people who , according to " Coexistence , " should have been Israel 's friends.Outrage on the Left <p> Right-wingers called for stronger security measures and new limits on work permits for Palestinians . But the most unusual reaction seemed to come from the Israeli left , which viewed the attacks as a betrayal of its own vision of who Arabs were and how they should behave . <p> Haim Ramon , leader of the opposition Labor Party 's dovish faction , called on the government to seal off the West Bank and Gaza Strip . Another prominent dove , Avraham Burg , along with four other Labor members of parliament , drafted a bill rescinding the 1972 legislation granting general entry permits for Palestinian workers . <p> When an outbreak of stabbings occurred a year ago , virtually every major Israeli city fired its Palestinian workers and replaced them with recently arrived Soviet Jews . Many hotels and restaurants followed suit . In Bnei @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even ordered all private employers to fire their Arab workers . <p> Lately , police have launched sweeps of Palestinians waiting at bus stops and street corners inside Israel , arresting even those who hold work permits , according to Hannah Zohar of Workers ' Hotline , a Tel Aviv group that offers legal advice to Palestinians . Police contend the permits do not give Palestinians the right to travel or loiter inside Israel . The only sure way to avoid arrest is to be picked up by an Israeli employer at the Green Line and be returned there at the end of the day . <p> " Basically , every Palestinian is seen as a danger , " said lawyer Peleg . " So if they want to work , they must be unseen . " <p> Even among Israelis who had made a supreme effort to bridge the gap between the two communities , the killings and the Palestinian embrace of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein were an irreparable blow . <p> Levi Weiman-Kelman , a rabbi in the Reform Jewish movement here , spent four years attending dialogue sessions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jerusalem synagogue . But after the early thrill of meeting and talking with the enemy , he found himself frustrated . People tended to talk past each other , he recalled , concentrating on their own grievances and seldom hearing those of others . <p> It all came to a head one night shortly after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait , when a Palestinian journalist spoke passionately about support for Saddam Hussein . " I found myself wondering , " Weiman-Kelman said , " Am I supposed to share feelings and values with this guy ? It led to a real sense of of suspicion and betrayal . It was a hard lesson to learn , and I say it full of sadness . " <p> That was Weiman-Kelman 's last session with Palestinians . " I had spent literally hundreds of hours in these meetings , " he said . " Now it 's over . We 're focusing on ecology . The peace process may happen , but my mantra now is : Do n't have expectations . That way you do n't get burned . " <p> Weiman-Kelman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Five years ago , Arab families picnicking on the grass were a familiar sight on Saturdays in nearby Liberty Bell Park , one of the city 's largest open spaces . Now they are gone . During the summer , many young Palestinians used to swim at the local pool . Three years ago , pool authorities stopped selling day tickets and restricted it to members only . The Arabs vanished . <p> Chafets faced the dilemma personally earlier this year when he decided to remodel his kitchen . " The thought of Palestinian workers with sharp implements wandering around my house frightened me , " Chafets wrote in the Jerusalem Report . <p> " My concern , I confess , made me uneasy , " he continued . " Most Palestinian laborers are peaceable working men who only want to feed their families . Is it fair , I asked myself , to discriminate against everyone for the crimes of a few ? Maybe not , I decided , but how do you tell the good guys from the terrorists ? I wanted a new kitchen , but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a friend whose young son asked recently about Israelis : " Are they born as Jews or born as people ? " <p> Kuttab is a prominent human rights lawyer in his late thirties , a member of a generation of intellectuals who , while active in Palestinian causes , have sought to form political and personal alliances with sympathetic Israelis . He speaks Hebrew , has visited Yad Vashem , the Holocaust memorial museum here , and boasts many Jewish friends and acquaintances . He even likes " Fiddler on the Roof . " Palestinians , he said , can identify with the musical 's romantic images of rural life and with its depiction of the struggle of Jewish villagers against their Cossack rulers . Yet , Kuttab said , his Jewish friends would be horrified at how Jews are perceived by Palestinians.Palestinian Hatred and Bitterness <p> Palestinians still see Jews as despoilers who have stolen their homes and their pride , according to Kuttab . The Palestinians ' lack of rights , their sense that for Israel only Jews matter , feeds their anger . There are times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welling up " in his own heart , said Kuttab , who seeks out his Jewish friends to remind himself that not all Jews are the same . <p> Kuttab has a liberal Israeli friend whose son joined the army a year or so ago , a friend he has n't seen since . " What if I was sitting in his house and his son walked in in uniform ? " he asked . " I do n't know how I 'd react or how he 'd react . I do n't know how to deal with it . I ca n't pretend it does n't matter . " <p> Israelis can not accept Palestinians as fellow humans , said Kuttab , because it means accepting them politically . " For Jews to acknowledge Palestinians , they have to acknowledge that they took someone 's land , that they live in someone 's home and that they have to reach an accommodation with them . It does n't leave them exclusive possession or rights . They do n't feel the need to come to this , but until they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words are eerily echoed by Rivka Bar-Asher , a Jewish resident of Shiloh and a friend of the late Rachel Druck . Israelis do not hate Palestinians , she said , but they have no intention of acknowledging them as equals . <p> In the days before the Palestinian uprising , when there was still contact between settlers and neighboring villagers , she recalled , a Palestinian man told her husband he had just lost a sick cow whose value was so high to him that he would have preferred to lose one of his daughters . <p> " They do n't love each other , " said Bar-Asher , " so how can they ever love us ? " <p> Jewish philosopher David Hartman said the need for acknowledgement cuts both ways . Israelis may hold a virtual monopoly of military power over Palestinians , yet they still feel vulnerable , still search for acceptance . " Jews returned home to find it was occupied by someone else and to find themselves treated as alien outsiders , strangers in a strange land , " he said . " We need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the day he can evict us again . We are waiting to be accepted , to be welcomed home . " <p> ' This Land Is Ours ' <p> Who is the owner of the national home , and who is the unwanted guest ? Nowhere is the question more painfully visible these days than in a collection of rundown stone houses in Silwan , a decaying neighborhood nestled just below the Old City walls in Arab East Jerusalem . <p> Until a few months ago , Silwan was an all-Arab community of about 30,000 people . But for the past seven years , Jewish settlers using funds from Israel 's Housing Ministry have been secretly purchasing titles and leases to houses in the area . Then , on the same day in early October that U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III arrived here to work out final details of the Mideast peace conference in Madrid , settlers escorted by Israeli soldiers and police moved before dawn to evict Arab families and occupy a half-dozen houses . <p> At the time , Prime Minister Shamir sought to distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordered the settlers to vacate all but one of the houses while it pondered a permanent ruling . But the settlers returned in December , this time with full approval from a cabinet unwilling to risk political division over the issue . <p> Settlers and police arrived at Ahmed Karaeen 's door at 5:30 that morning . " They said , ' Karaeen , this house is ours . Take your family and leave , ' " he recalled . <p> Karaeen said police moved him , his wife and three children into the street in a rainstorm while settlers danced and offered prayers of thanksgiving . It was , said Jerusalem 's liberal Jewish Mayor Teddy Kollek , " an attack and an insult " not only to Palestinians but to the very concept of coexistence between Arabs and Jews . <p> Yigal Kenaan , a settler spokesman , sought to defend the action . " No Arab was thrown from his house illegally , " he said . " What they tell you is oriental imagination . " <p> Silwan , the settlers claim , is the original site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago , then resettled the area in the 1860s when they first ventured outside the Old City , which rises from the heights overlooking Silwan . They only abandoned the area in the 1920s and ' 30s under threat from rioting Arab nationalists . <p> " Is n't this what Zionism is all about ? " said Elyakim Haetzni , a German-born lawyer and member of parliament from the rightist Tehiya Party who is one of the founders of the settlement movement . " We have come to reclaim our homes , but Mr. Teddy Kollek calls this a provocation . It reminds me of Hitler , who said Jews living in Europe are a provocation . It 's so perverse I have no words for it . " <p> As for the Palestinians , said Kenaan , " There is no problem for Arabs to live here , " provided that " they accept that this land is ours and Jerusalem is our capital . " <p> The issue is now back in the courts , where it is expected to linger for months , if not years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divided between the settlers , who have seized eight rooms , and Musa Abbasi , who has been confined with his family to the remaining four . <p> Abbasi is angry about the eviction and angry , too , that the part of the house the settlers occupy includes his carefully tended garden . He watches bitterly as they pick the fruit from his lemon tree . <p> A few weeks ago , he recalled with some amazement , the settlers approached him for the first time for a chat . His reply was the answer Arabs and Jews have been giving each other for decades : <p> " They tried to talk to me . They said , ' We 're neighbors . ' I said , ' A neighbor would n't do something like this . I 'm sorry , but I ca n't talk to you . You destroyed my life . How can you expect me to talk to you ?
