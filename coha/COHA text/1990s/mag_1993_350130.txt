In movies this has been the year ( possibly the decade ) of the threatened child . The stories told about such children  --  abused or abandoned , in some way forced to cope prematurely with life 's terrors  --  can be read in a couple of ways . They may represent a revival of interest by moviemakers in one of fiction 's archetypes , that of the child alone and improvising in a world he did n't make and does n't understand . They may also reflect our relatively new sensitivity to child abuse . <P> Whatever the case , no youngster has lately , or perhaps ever , been placed in more deadly peril than 10-year-old Vito ( Manuel Colao ) in Flight of the Innocent . And no director has more vividly realized the plight of an innocent than youthful Carlo Carlei ( who wrote the screenplay with Gualtiero Rosella ) . One fine warm day in Calabria , in southern Italy , Vito 's entire family ( and a boy they have mysteriously sequestered in a cave nearby ) is massacred , and Vito @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who will stalk him ( and his nightmares ) for the rest of the film . <P> Neither Vito nor the audience entirely understands what 's happening to him . All he ( and we ) know is that he must flee for his life . And therein lies the key to this film 's success . For Carlei wants to thrust us into the mind of this almost completely silent boy . He gives us no more information than Vito acquires , in bits and pieces , as he flees to Rome in search of something , somebody  --  we 're not sure . Carlei 's camera is often radically subjective , seeing through Vito 's eyes as the boy rushes panicked through the streets . Equally often it is radically objective , tracking a small , lonely figure in landscapes mysterious and menacing to him . <P> These things we learn in due course : that Vito 's sole surviving relative is a small-time crook in Rome ; that the dead boy in the cave had been kidnapped by Vito 's family and was being held for ransom ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clan ( though their precise motives remain obscure ) . Vito catches glimpses of the dead boy 's parents on TV , making anguished pleas for his return . Eventually he feels compelled to make his way to them , and attempts to crawl into their son 's bed , into his very life . The moviemakers note that there have been nearly 700 kidnappings for ransom in Italy since 1986 . They also observe that murderous clan warfare is a continuing fact of life in Calabria . But Flight of the Innocent is not primarily a sociological tract nor an exercise in save-the-children sentiment . Little Vito has no time for such abstractions . His life depends on the correctness of hasty impressions , silent intuitions of danger . The result is something much better than sentiment . It is something quite close to the high emotions classic tragedy is supposed to evoke  --  quite close , that is , to pity and terror .
