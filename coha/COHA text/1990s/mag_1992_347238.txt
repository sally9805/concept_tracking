WITH HIS BITTER PRESCRIPTION FOR ELIMINATING THE FEDERAL DEFICIT BY 1998 , Ross Perot likes to style himself as the straight-talking realist of American politics . Perot was at it again last week , appearing on the Today show to chide the presidential candidates for failing to tackle the deficit , and hinting anew that he would jump back into the race unless they faced the issues . <P> But panelists in TIME 's economic forum warned that Perot 's medicine would be the wrong tonic to give the economy now . " It would be an absolute disaster to have a Ross Perot program in 1993 , " said Donald Ratajczak , an economics professor at Georgia State . " We would probably go back into recession . " Concurred Boston economist Allen Sinai : " Deficit reduction at this time , when the economy is so weak , is the wrong way to go . " That 's because the painful tax increases and spending cuts that Perot advocates would take money away from consumers and companies , thus deepening the country 's already palpable mood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deficit is a crippling burden on the economy that must be confronted in the long run . The main problem the red ink causes is soaking up savings that could otherwise be used for investments in factories and machinery and to create new jobs . Panel members said the government should move to reduce the deficit once the economy becomes strong enough to tolerate the treatment , which could mean waiting until 1994.
