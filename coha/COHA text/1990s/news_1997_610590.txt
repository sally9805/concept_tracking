<p> If an " ET " sequel were made today , the plot might involve whether the innocent little extraterrestrial could make it through a gantlet of long distance discounters in time to phone home . After all , even consumers from this planet find it confusing . <p> Just when people were getting used to major long-distance carriers like AT &T,; Sprint and MCI dueling for their business , a phenomenon called dial-around services muddled things further . <p> The dial-around companies are the ones that send you fliers in the mail , usually complete with stickers to put on your phones , promising discounts up to 68 percent off the major carriers . They tell you to dial a five-digit number starting with 10 ( 10-XXX ) to " dial around " your regular long-distance carrier and use their lower rates , without switching carriers . <p> In the past six months , I 've received mailings at my home in Falls Church from five different dial-around companies . I decided to compare charges for actual calls , using my regular carrier ( AT &T); and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I found that many of the promised dial-around savings were grossly overstated  --  or nonexistent . One company charged me nearly double my AT &T; rate for daytime calls . At the same time , some dial-around services do save money under the right circumstances . <p> My sample included four-minute calls ( one day , one night ) to my stepdaughter , Leah , in Connecticut ; an eight-minute evening call to my friend Rebecca in California ; a six-minute daytime call to my sister-in-law , Karen , in St. Louis ; and a two-minute daytime call to my friend Chris in Poland . The results are shown on the chart on this page . <p> I made the same calls using AT &T; and four dial-around services : Telco 's " Dial &; Save " ( 10-457 ) , VarTec Telecom 's " DimeLine " ( 10-811 ) , Telecom USA 's 10-321 , and WorldxChange 's " Talk Cents " ( 10-502 ) . The fifth one , Long Distance International Inc. ' s 10-799 , came in later , so the charges on the chart are taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact about my experiment . At home , I use AT &T's; flat , 15-cent-a-minute plan . Most dial-arounds promise huge savings by comparing their rates to the standard direct-dial rates of AT &T; and other major carriers , which are much higher than those carriers ' discount rates . <p> Dial-around companies justify comparing their own best rates with AT &T's; worst rates by saying those are the ones AT &T; customers still generally use . Consumer groups agree this is true ( some estimate that about two-thirds of residential customers are still on basic rates ) , but say the first step for a consumer should be to call his regular carrier and see what better plan is available . <p> The major carriers all have a variety of plans available to anyone , including the one I use now , which gives me a 15-cent rate at any time to any place in the country . Other plans offer volume discounts , cash back or dime-a-minute calls during off-peak hours . <p> After changing to a better " pre-subscribed " long-distance plan , consumers then should analyze their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dial-around offer before deciding whether it really will save them money off their regular carriers , consumer advocates say . <p> " You need to be really careful with dial-arounds . A lot of offers sound too good to be true and often are , " said Geoff Mordock , a research associate at the Telecommunications Research and Action Center , a District-based nonprofit group that gives consumers tips on long-distance options . " We 've kind of recommended against them initially because there are a lot of hidden charges . " <p> Dial-arounds often charge an access fee ( usually about $ 5 for any month the service is used ) whether you make one or 100 calls using the system . Whether you break even on the access fee depends on what your regular rate is and how many minutes you talk . At least one dial-around , CenterVarTec 's " DimeLine , " charges a minimum of three minutes , even if you 're on the line only one minute . <p> " The asterisk often takes away what 's given in the big print up above , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Action , a Bethesda-based nonprofit consumer service . The group recently put out a cautionary brochure on dial-around services , using funds from AT &T.; <p> Telecom USA <p> One dial-around company , Telecom USA ( 10-321 ) , charged me nearly double my AT &T; flat rate for daytime calls ( except my one international call ) . Even the charges for the evening calls were slightly higher using the dial-around . <p> Telecom 's flier promised I would save " up to 50 percent . " The fine print says the 50 percent applies to calls over 20 minutes . It also promises : " Always save over AT &T; on every call within the U.S.* " The asterisk clarifies that it is only if you are comparing to AT &T; basic residential rates , excluding promotions . <p> Telecom is a wholly owned subsidiary of MCI , but its flier gives no indication of this . Nor does it give any specific rates , which depend on time of day and place called . A call to Telecom 's customer-service number listed on the flier puts a consumer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get through to a live person . Rates for specific calls are available by recording , however , and a sampling of mine made it clear I would not get any savings unless the call lasted more than 20 minutes . Even then , the rate for several of my daytime calls was 28 cents a minute , dropping to 14 cents for the whole call if it went beyond 20 minutes . But that is only a penny a minute off my 15-cent rate . <p> Telecom 's 10-321 is intended to appeal to AT &T's; basic-rate customers , especially those making longer calls , said MCI spokesman Brad Burns . Since its introduction last October , it has been " wildly successful , " Burns said . <p> WorldxChange <p> The best dial-around bargain in my sample proved to be through WorldxChange 's " Talk Cents " ( 10-502 ) , which offers a 9-cent-a-minute rate with a $ 4.95-a-month access fee . With just the five calls in my sample , I did n't save any money over AT &T,; because of the access fee . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domestic long-distance calls , which I do exceed each month . <p> There 's just one problem with " Talk Cents " : Unlike when I used the other services , I often could n't get through using 10-502 , repeatedly getting " circuits-are-busy " messages . <p> Etc . <p> The three other dial-arounds I looked at  --  VarTec 's " DimeLine , " Telco 's " Dial &; Save , " and LDI  --  were somewhere in between the other two . <p> * I break even on VarTec 's $ 5 a month access fee after 100 minutes of its 10-cent flat rate on domestic calls , but I could lose money with its 3-minute minimum because of all the times I get an answering machine and leave a brief message . <p> * Telco 's " Dial &; Save " has no monthly fee or minimum , but its charges for my daytime calls were significantly higher than AT &T's.; The charges on my evening calls were only somewhat better than AT &T's,; saving me 6 cents on an 8-minute call to California  --  not enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nicholas A. Merrick , chief financial officer of the Chantilly-based Telco Communications Group ( recently acquired by the Dallas-based Excel Communications Inc. ) , said " Dial &; Save " is only one of Telco 's long-distance products . <p> The 25-percent savings promised in its brochure would in fact be realized for the majority of AT &T; customers who still have basic rates , Merrick said . But he said customers can also call Telco and get a 10-cent-a-minute rate for a $ 3 fee under a different plan not mentioned in the " Dial &; Save " letter . <p> What dial-arounds offer customers , Merrick said , is a call-by-call alternative that they can use whenever it will give them a break over their regular carriers . Moreover , Merrick speculated that AT &T; would not offer discounted rate plans like my flat rate if it were n't for the competitive pressures of dial-arounds . <p> * Unlike some of the dial-arounds , LDI of Fort Lauderdale , Fla. , also has a significant business providing regular " pre-subscribed " long-distance service to consumers , rather than just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screams that you can save up to 68 percent on long-distance calls by first dialing 10-799 . But a call to LDI 's 800 number gets a customer-service representative who acknowledges that the dial-around service will cost me more than AT &T's; flat rate for daytime calls and will give me a real discount only on weekends and in the middle of the night . ( I would get some break from LDI 's policy of charging in 6-second segments , rather than rounding to the whole minute , as most carriers do . ) LDI 's dial-around daytime rate ( from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. ) is 19.9 cents a minute ; evenings , 14.9 cents a minute ; and calls made on weekends and between 11 p.m. and 8 a.m. are 12.9 cents a minute , she said . <p> But if I sign up for LDI 's regular long-distance service , not mentioned in the letter urging the use of the 10-799 number , I would save money , she promised . <p> International <p> International charges are trickier , but here are general conclusions : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call to Poland was through WorldxChange 's " Talk Cents , " which charged 78 cents for the two-minute call , compared with AT &T's; $ 3.14 . At that rate , I make up the " Talk Cents " $ 4.95 access fee in one five-minute call to Poland . <p> LeeAnn Kuster , a spokeswoman at AT &T,; said if I knew to ask for it I could have signed up for AT &T's; $ 3-a-month international call plan and paid 59 cents a minute for a call to Poland . On that plan , the rate for most of Europe is 35 cents a minute , and the United Kingdom is 12 cents , Kuster said . <p> Even so , the " Talk Cents " rate would still save me money over AT &T's; discounted international plan once I 've talked at least 10 minutes to Poland . If I then use the dial-around number for domestic calls for the rest of the month , I save 6 cents a minute on each one . <p> But again , I had problems getting through to Poland on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go through , the second got me a busy signal even though the phone was n't in use , and when the third call went through Chris heard a strong echo throughout the conversation . Another day , I never did get a connection . <p> There is also a puzzling twist on the " Talk Cents " rates . A notice at the bottom of a page filled with dozens of sample international rates , including the 39-cent-a-minute rate to Poland , says those rates are given automatically to first-time " Talk Cents " users . After that , the customer may " select " those rates by calling a customer-service 800 number . A representative at that number ( which was busy for some time ) assured me that even without calling I would have gotten at least as good a rate on future " Talk Cents " calls . Whether that holds up I will find out on future bills . <p> Again , consumer groups suggest first asking about special plans for international calls through your regular carrier . <p> Meanwhile , industry experts expect the dial-around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with more promises .
