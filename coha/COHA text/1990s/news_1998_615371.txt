<p> It has had to live with another early playoffs departure by his team . His coaching staff was shuffled . He 's been caring for an ailing sister . Phone messages went unreturned . Sunday at the winter meetings , Cox sat down with staff writer Thomas Stinson to discuss a wide range of topics , from how his team 's retooling , the changes on the staff and the prospects for 1999 . <p> Q : Your team has had its share of pain in October . How hard was last October to take ? <p> A : Well , they 're all hard to lose . We had a great year , I thought . We won an awful lot of ballgames and we lost a series . That 's the only way I can look at it . It would have been a heartbreaker for either club . We really thought when we got three down that would do it . <p> Q : Can you review the club 's shift in philosophy when the team dealt away a starting pitcher and upgraded the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk about ( second baseman ) Bret Boone , I think he 's the best defensive second baseman in baseball . Period . And he happened to hit 24 homers with 90 RBIs . That 's pretty hard to pass up . I sure hate to see ( Denny ) Neagle go , but yet we got two good guys back in that trade , too . I do n't think it had anything to do with the playoffs . Even the other teams who won , if you were just looking at them in that regard , they 'd be searching for some offense right now , too , because all you were facing was great pitching . We were a little bit cold at the time , but . . . <p> Q : Where will Boone hit in the order ? <p> A : I have n't determined my lineup yet . I 'm going to wait until spring training and talk to all the individuals , because it 's a tough lineup . We 're going to have a great bottom of the order . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Michael ) Tucker and Andruw Jones . <p> Q : How hard was it for you to shake up your staff ? That group had been together eight years before Clarence Jones and Jim Beauchamp were reassigned . <p> A : Tough , because we 've had nothing but success with those coaches , and it 's always hard to make changes . It was a little rough . But we got good guys coming in . I 'm looking forward to breaking in Ned ( Yost ) at third base and working with Don ( Baylor ) on the bench , with hitting and whatever else he can offer . <p> Q : Were you resistant to making the changes ? <p> A : ( Laughing ) Well , that 's why I did n't answer the phone . But no , it 's hard . It 's hard to let people go . You 're talking about careers ; you 're talking about their livelihood and talking about great people . And you 're talking about success . So it was hard . I mean , I love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Glenn Hubbard ; I always respected Glenn . It was time that Ned started coaching on the bases , and it 's a good move . Everything is going to work out . <p> Q : Ryan Klesko 's name had been run through several trade scenarios since the season ended . Are you planning to have him next season ? <p> A : I 'm planning on Ryan Klesko playing . You bet . I know we have Otis Nixon , and Otis can still be a very viable leadoff guy . He 's a real pain in the rear to other clubs . He can still run and bunt . I would guess if someone knocks us really hard on Ryan , then we 'd really have to think about it . But I like Ryan Klesko . He had a little bit of an off season , but he 's one of those gamers . You like to see those guys playing on your team . I think Ryan can straighten out his swing this season a little bit and hit 40 or 50 home runs . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Q : Can new hitting coach Don Baylor help him ? <p> A : Yeah , why not ? Don 's a very good hitting instructor . So is ( the departed ) Clarence Jones , but maybe some new input would be good . <p> Q : Potentially , you have three left fielders with Klesko , Nixon and Gerald Williams . What are your plans for playing time ? A : I do n't know what we 're going to do right now . Right now , Ryan Klesko is going to hit ( fifth ) right behind Andres Galarraga . Otis signed knowing that right now his role is going to be filling in occasionally and helping us out . Sometimes that turns into a full-time job with injuries . <p> Q : What intangibles does Brian Jordan bring to this team ? <p> A : I 've never known Brian personally , but I 've met him before , met him for a few hours prior to his signing with us and I like his makeup an awful lot . Just sitting in the other dugout , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 's serious about the game of baseball and he 's ( got ) very good talent . He runs good , throws pretty darn good , too , and he 'll go get the ball . He 's got power and he 's hard to strike out . He 's one of those guys who will beat a lot of pitches off and force the pitchers into making a lot of pitches . Sitting in the opposite dugout , you rate hitters and he 's one of the tougher outs that we had to face . <p> Q : Has the closer situation changed since the end of the season ? <p> A : Right now , we 're just hoping everybody comes back good and healthy . We were a little concerned about Rudy Seanez at the end of the season , but in the last playoff round he threw great . With him and ( Kerry ) Ligtenberg and ( John ) Rocker and a few other guys , I thought it was a very good bullpen . We do n't know if Mark Wohlers is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gut feeling on Wohlers ? <p> A : I have no feeling on that right now . It 's a very hard call and quite honestly , you do n't see many guys bouncing back from that . But I think he 's in great spirits . From what I understand , he 's working out and is going to be ready to go . It would n't shock me if he bounced back . That 's for sure . <p> Q : What role do you see from Mike Remlinger , the pitcher who came over from Cincinnati as part of the Boone deal ? <p> A : We expect to use him out of the ' pen . I think he 's going to be a good addition . I like his arm a lot . I 've seen him really good and I 've seen him so-so . But when you see guys ( pitch ) good , that means it 's in there and it can always come out . He 's got as good stuff as Cincinnati had . He rates right up there with our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be really , really good . He could be a strikeout guy . <p> Q : Is Bruce Chen locked in your plans for the fifth starter in the rotation ? <p> A : Well , right now , if he had to open , yeah , it 'd be ( Kevin ) Millwood and Chen at 4 and 5 . Pretty good young kids . ( Chen ) is highly thought of throughout baseball . <p> Q : Does outfielder George Lombard have a chance at making the 25-man roster this spring ? <p> A : As we sit here now , no . He needs to play one more year probably in Triple-A and then he would be ready , in our minds . <p> Q : Who else has a real chance of making the team out of spring training ? <p> A : Right now , I ca n't think of anybody else that 's going to have a great chance at making our club . <p> Q : There do n't appear to be any holes on the roster . A : Yeah , I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cox
