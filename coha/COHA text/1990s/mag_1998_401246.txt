God bless Dr. Spock . The legacy of the late Benjamin Spock , M.D. , foremost authority on all things parental , wo n't just be the no-nonsense information he dispensed for 40 years to nervous moms and dads . No , America 's favorite pediatrician will also be remembered for sparking one heck of a debate on the health benefits of a vegetarian diet for children . Before his death last March at age 94 , the good doctor revised the seventh edition of his definitive Dr. Spock 's Baby and Child Care ( Pocket Books , 1998 ) , a book outsold only by the Bible . Among his final words : Rear children on a plant-based diet devoid of dairy products after the age of 2 . Spock , who recovered from chronic bronchitis after adopting a vegetarian diet himself at 88 , had come to believe that if children did the same , they would be less likely to develop weight problems and contemporary lifestyle diseases , like heart disease , diabetes , high blood pressure and cancer . He also believed that meat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they actually aggravate many childhood ailments , such as ear infections , digestive disorders and respiratory problems . " Research shows us very clearly that vegetables , grains , beans and fruits should take center stage , " Spock wrote . " They provide the nutrition children need to grow and avoid the cholesterol and animal fat that can cause so many problems . My siblings and I were given no red meat until we were 12 years of age , and we were all healthy . We should have continued to avoid meat through adolescence and adulthood . " For vegetarians , this was welcome , if unsurprising , news . After all , the benefits of a meat-free lifestyle for people , animals and the environment have been known in this country for decades . A rich collection of studies have demonstrated that vegetarians do live longer and have significantly reduced risks of major diseases and obesity . Prominent physicians like Dean Ornish , Charles Attwood , and Neil Barnard have all publicly promoted the health advantages of a plant-based diet . But coming from Spock , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guru encouraging everyone to jump on the vegetarian bandwagon bound for good health . At last , it seemed , the debate over meatless eating was over . Going veg was the most important step parents could take to safeguard their children 's long-term health . Thus spake Dr. Spock . Then came the fireworks . Within two weeks of the book 's publication last June , The New York Times ran two articles debunking Spock 's advice , calling it hazardous to children . Members of the conventional medical community lined up to shoot down his recommendations . " Absolutely insane , " T. Berry Brazelton , M.D. , railed in the Times when asked to comment . A prominent child behavior specialist with Boston City Hospital , Brazelton adamantly insisted that meat and dairy are critical for childhood development . Michael Georgiess , M.D. , professor of pediatrics and child development at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis echoed that sentiment , warning that vegetarian kids faced " very significant risks . " Johanna Dwyer , a nutrition expert at Tufts-New England Medical Center in Boston , added , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demonstrable health benefits , like those outlined in the U.S. Department of Agriculture 's food pyramid . " As the controversy raged , all the old , familiar misconceptions about vegetarianism got a fresh airing : That meat and dairy are essential for good health ; a vegetarian diet does n't provide the nutrients children require ; meatless cooking is a hassle ; and kids wo n't eat a vegetarian diet because they do n't like the food and fear being different from their peers . Since classically trained physicians receive almost no formal nutrition training , they cling to these outdated views . ( Of the 125 accredited U.S. medical schools , just 32 require students to take nutrition courses ; and another 50 offer it as an elective . ) As science helps us to better understand the role that food plays in health and longevity , these misconceptions are slowly going the way of the rotary dial phone . The American Dietetic Association supports a vegetarian diet for children . So does the National Academy of Sciences and the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine . We are indebted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the nutritional soundness-and life-long health benefitsof a vegetarian diet for children . So , here we go . Once again , from the top . MISCONCEPTION #1 Children need animal products . No , they do n't . Meat and dairy products may be cornerstones of the standard American diet , but that does n't mean they 're good for us . Meat is a source of protein , necessary for muscle and tissue growth . But meat also contains a lot of things that kids should do without : steroids , hormones , antibiotics , not to mention high levels of saturated fat and cholesterol ( meat is the leading source of saturated fat in the American diet ) . The same is true of dairy products . A significant source of calcium , they , too , come with high levels of saturated fat and cholesterol-milk is the second leading source of saturated fat-and contain antibiotics , pesticides and hormones . " These are all known health hazards , " says Richard DeAndrea , M.D. , medical director for California Universal Healthcare , a complementary health clinic in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the body 's immune system and hormonal balance . " Growth hormones used in dairy and meat production , says DeAndrea , are associated with declining age of menstruation ( 150 years ago , girls menstruated at 17 ; today they begin at 11 ) , which in turn has been linked with increased rates of breast cancer . " We 're seeing this drop in the onset age of puberty in industrialized nations , " he says . " But we do n't see it in Third World nations , where people do n't consume as much meat and dairy and they ca n't afford to administer hormones to their animals . " Stacks of studies have also linked dairy to lactose intolerance , allergies , asthma , digestive problems , diabetes , migraine headaches and , ironically , osteoporosis . What gets lost in the debate about whether meat and dairy do a body good is that they are neither the best-nor only-sources of these nutrients . Plant proteins contain all of the amino acids required to make up a complete protein , according to a 1990 report in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greens , such as kale , bok choy and broccoli , contain as much absorbable calcium as milk-without the fat , cholesterol or harmful additives . Provided that they get adequate calories and a good balance of fruits , vegetables , grains , legumes and soy products , kids do just fine on a meatless diet ( see " Frequently Asked Questions , " p.70 ) . Research done at Kings College in London , and published in the journal Pediatric Clinics of North America ( August 1995 ) , found " higher than average intelligence quotients " among vegetarian children . The China Oxford Cornell Project on Diet , Lifestyle and Disease Characteristics , a wide-spectrum population study conducted in Taiwan since 1983 , demonstrated that while Chinese girls raised on a vegan ( no animal products ) diet mature more slowly than American girls , published in the journal Pediatrics ( September 1989 ) , indicates that vegetarian children are leaner than their meat-eating counterparts by about two and a half pounds , owing to the low levels of saturated fat in a plant-based diet . Our high-fat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Recent government statistics say one-half the American adult population is overweight . Heart disease is the No. 1 killer in America , claiming nearly 2 million lives a year . Adultonset ( Type II ) diabetes affects some 16 million Americans and causes 187,000 deaths annually . Breast and colon cancers ( both diet-related ) are expected to take 43,500 and 47,700 lives this year , respectively . These are grim statistics , and as the next generation matures , we can look forward to more of the same . Gorging on burgers , chicken nuggets , fries and shakes , today 's children have ballooned into the heaviest in history . The National Center for Health Statistics reports that 10 percent of 4- and 5-year-old girls were overweight as of 1994 , the last year for which statistics were available , compared with 5.8 percent in 1974 . The numbers are even higher for 6- to 11-year-olds : 13.6 percent overweight as of 1994 , compared with 5.5 in 1974 . The Bogulusa Heart Study , a 25year study conducted by Louisiana State University in New Orleans , confirmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead to heart disease form in arteries by age 3 . " Children eating the typical American diet are going to be the heart patients of the year 2020 , " warns Charles Attwood , M.D. , author of Dr. Attwood 's Low-Fat Prescription for Kids ( Viking , 1995 ) . " Clogged arteries are related to saturated fat in a child 's diet , and children who eat a primarily vegetarian diet do not have these fatty deposits in their arteries that we see as early as age 3 and certainly by age 12 . " " We 've done the Great American Experiment on our children , " adds Michael Klaper , M.D. , author of Pregnancy , Children and a Vegan Diet ( Gentle World , Inc. , 1988 ) . " We 've seen what a high-fat diet combined with a sedentary lifestyle creates . We have the fattest generation of children in history , with all the implications of early disease and death that that implies . Fostering animalbased diets as part of our children 's food habits is the proverbial deal with the devil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a plant-based diet is the best nutritional start we can give our children . " MISCONCEPTION #2 It 's a hassle to raise kids vegetarian . All parents want to give their children a smart start , but as most will attest , getting kids to eat anything can be a Herculean task . " Every mother I know struggles with feeding her children , " says Anna Thomas , author of The New Vegetarian Epicure ( Knopf , 1996 ) and mother of two teenage boys . " Just when you think you have it figured out and you stock the fridge , all of a sudden , it 's I 'm tired of that , ' and they 're on to something else . " But tempting children with healthy vegetarian food is no more difficult than getting them to eat meat-based fare ( see 10 Ways to Get Your Kid to Eat More Vegetables , p. 75 ) . The truth is , it 's never been easier . Vast resources exist to help you , from books that ease you into a meatless lifestyle in just five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kid-friendly recipes to parental support groups on the Internet . ( Noteworthy ones include Vegetaran Children : A Supportive Guide for Parents by Sharon Yntema McBooks Press , 19951 and the Vegetarian Resource Center 's VegParent e-mail discussion group . Send your name and e-mail address to list@vegetarian.org and ask to be added to the list . ) Your supermarket is another valued resource . In addition to hearty organic produce sections , most mainstream grocery chains now stock diverse selections of grains , from brown rice and kamut to spelt , quinoa and couscous . You 'll even find tofu , seitan and tempeh tucked in the refrigerator section along with soy and rice milks , vegetable broth and perhaps even nut and seed butters , such as almond , cashew or sesame , that give a new twist to the classic PB &J.; Do n't forget that many kid favorites are either already vegetarian or easily transformed : tacos , burritos , lasagna and vegetable curries . " It 's not as out of this world as people think , " says Wendy Muldawer , co-author of Better Than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a collection of quick and easy kid-tested vegetarian recipes . " While it takes a certain commitment , you can come up with healthy vegetarian meal without being a slave to your kitchen . " MISCONCEPTION #3 Kids do n't like vegetarian food and do n't want to be different from their friends . If you think kids wo n't go for the lifestyle , think again . Given their love of animals and concern for the environment , children are natural candidates for vegetarianism . Exact figures are hard to come by , but the consensus is that 12 to 14 million Americans call themselves vegetarian-about 5 percent are children , according to the Vegetarian Resource Group , a nonprofit educational organization based in Baltimore . Adolescents are considered the fastest-growing segment of the vegetarian community . " Our children understood we were opposed to killing animals , " says Theresa Gunderson , mother of three in College Station , Pa . " Not eating meat was n't a problem for them . " The New York Times made much of the so-called " deprivation " aspect for kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hot dogs and burgers that generally comprise party menus . The paper of record actually made it sound as if parents were consigning their kids to prison rations , instead of food that 's delicious , diverse and yes , healthy . The fact is , vegetarian children lack for nothing . Vegetarian convenience foods are the most rapidly expanding area of the natural foods market with an annual growth rate of 20 percent , according to Spence Information Services , a market research firm in San Francisco . So there are plenty of options . If your kid wants burgers , give her veggie burgers . In the mood for hot dogs ? Try soy dogs . Milk on the cereal ? Go for soy or nut milks . Grilled cheese ? Use soy or rice cheese on multigrain bread . Screaming for ice cream ? Dish up a sundae made with a tofu- or ricebased frozen dessert . Your kid 's plate wo n't look or taste less wonderful than her friends ' ' - but you 'll know it 's healthier . " It seems like they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I can tell Sean that he 's having burgers and French fries , but really he 's eating a fat-free veggie burger with soy protein and sweet potato fries . " It 's all in the approach . If parents learn to make veggies fun , children will learn to love them . " When you say feed them kale or broccoli , people laugh like it 's a joke , " says Suzanne Havala , R.D. , a registered dietitian and author of Good Foods , Bad Foods : What 's Left To Eat ( Chronimed , 1998 ) . " I 've seen lots of kids eat those foods . It 's all about the attitudes that parents have themselves . " It 's a simple formula , adds Sheldon Lewis , father of two teenage boys in New York City . " They eat what you eat . " It seems to work . Spice WilliamsCrosby of Sherman Oaks , Calif. , recalls when her 3-year-old Luke turned up his nose at Jell-O ( which contains animal products ) during a hospital stay . He demanded zucchini @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kid was possessed , " she says . " They were in a panic trying to make a plate of steamed zucchini in that hospital . When they brought it , he ate every single piece , but he would not eat the Jell-O . " Raising vegetarian children is more than resisting the siren call of McDonald 's , however . Social factors-pressure from friends , well-meaning relatives-are often the biggest challenges facing young vegetarians . But just as parents teach their kids to say no to drugs , they can teach them to say no to meat . Start by talking with your child about why the family is vegetarian . Even small children can understand if it 's explained in simple terms . Some suggestions include : " Animals are our friends , and we do n't need to eat them , " or " Meat and milk gunk up the insides of our bodies and make us sick , " or " It takes a lot of grain to raise animals for Happy Meals and hungry people would have more to eat if we fed them the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children can also help eliminate any feelings of being different , as can talking to teachers , the parents of your children 's friends and members of your extended family who may think they 're doing your child a favor by slipping him some chicken or fish . It also does n't hurt to arm your kids with some essential survival skills , such as bringing their own lunches and snacks , learning to make a meal out of side dishes at a party or restaurant and asking for something else if it seems like there 's nothing for them to eat . And remind your children that they do n't need to explain why they wo n't eat certain things . They can simply say , " No , thanks . I do n't care for that . " Of course , it 's easy to keep tabs on what kids eat when they 're young . But as they get older and spend more time away from home , it becomes more difficult . What more perfect rebellion for a kid who 's never eaten meat than to start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your child orders a bacon double cheeseburger . How a parent finesses that situation , say those who 've been there , will greatly impact the food choices children make later in life . Some parents follow a Do n't Ask , Do n't Tell policy . " My son went through a period of time in high school when he did n't outwardly voice that he was eating meat , but I suspected he was , " says Gunderson . " He understood why we did n't eat meat . And if he tried it on his own , that was his decision at that point . He later came around on his own and became a strict vegetarian . " Others ignore what their kids are eating on the outside but serve all-vegetarian meals at home . " I do n't argue , " says Thomas . " I try not to force anything , especially with teens-it will only backfire and come back as major rebellion . I keep offering them good food , but I let them find their own way . " In the end , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children what you believe , then stand back and let them choose . " At a certain point you have to let them do what they want to do , " says Lewis . " The more uncompromising you are , the more they 're going to do behind your back . It comes down to having respect for your child . You feed them a certain way because you love and respect them and want to take care of them . When they grow up , you respect that they can take care of themselves . " Hopefully , you taught them well . <p>
