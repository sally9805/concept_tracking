Judd The Runaway JUDD Thompson Jr . had always hated having the same name as his father . Until now . Every time the phone rang and someone asked for Judd , it was " Which one ? Big Judd or Little Judd ? " The funny thing was , Little Judd was already taller than his father . He had just gotten his driver 's license , and the whiskers on his chin formed a thin goatee . He was tired of being called Junior , and if he were never called Little Judd again for the rest of his life , it would be too soon . But now , for once , being Judd Thompson Jr . was working in Judd 's favor . This break was meant to be , Judd decided . After days of fighting with his parents about where he was going , who he was with , what he was doing , and how late he would be in , he had just happened to be home one afternoon . And his mother picked that day to ask him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this was meant to be , Judd did n't know what did . Judd sighed loudly at his mother 's request . She said he acted like any small chore or favor was the biggest burden in the world . That was exactly how he felt . He did n't want to be told to do anything . " Why ca n't you get it ? " he asked her . " Because I asked you to , " she said . " Why do I have to do everything ? " " Would you like to compare what you do around here with what I do ? " she asked , and that began the usual argument . Only when his mother threatened to ground him did he stompout to the mailbox . He was glad he did . On the way back to the house , idly flipping through catalogs and letters and magazines , he had found itan envelope addressed to him . It was clearly a mistakeobviously intended for his father . He knew that as soon as he saw it . It was business mail . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be ornery , he slipped it inside his jacket and gave the rest of the mail to his mother . Well , he did n't actually give it to her . He tossed it onto the kitchen table in front of her , and half of it slid to the floor . He headed to his room . " Just a minute , young man , " she said , using another of his least favorite names . " Get back here and give me this mail properly . " " In a minute , " he said , jogging up the steps . " Oh , never mind , " she said . " By the time you get back here , I 'll have it picked up , read , and answered . " " You 're welcome ! " he hollered . " A job not finished is not worthy of a thank-you , " she said . " But thanks anyway . " Judd took off his jacket , cranked up his music , and lay on his bed , opening the envelope . Onto his chest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jr . A sticker on it told him to call a toll-free number and answer a few questions so he could begin using the card . The letter told him they had honored his request . He could spend tens of thousands of dollars using that card alone . Judd could n't believe his luck . He dialed the number and was asked his mother 's maiden name and his date of birth . He knew enough to use his grandmother 's maiden name and his father 's birthday . This was , after all , really his father 's card , wrong name or not . The automated voice told Judd he could begin using the card immediately . It was then that he planned his escape . Judd felt desperate to get away . He was n't sure what had happened or why , but he was sure his family was the problem . Judd 's father owned a business in Chicago and was wealthy . His mother had never had to work outside the home . Judd 's little brother and sister , nine-year-old twins Marc and Marcie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were OK , he guessed . Marc 's and Marcie 's rooms were full of trophies from church , the same as Judd 's had once been . He had really been into that stuff , memorizing Bible verses , going to camp every summer , all that . But when Judd had gone from the junior high to the senior high youth group at New Hope Village Church in Mount Prospect , Illinois , he seemed to lose interest overnight . He used to invite his friends to church and youth group . Now he was embarrassed to say his parents made him go . Judd felt he had outgrown church . It had been OK when he was a kid , but now nobody wanted to dress like he did , listen to his kind of music , or have a little fun . At school he hung with kids who got to make their own decisions and do what they wanted to do . That was all he wanted . A little freedom . Even though they could afford it , Judd 's parents refused to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school juniors still rode the bus to school ? When Judd did get to drive one of his parents ' cars , one of them told him where he could go , whom he could go with , what he could do , and when he had to be back . If only his parents knew what he was doing when they thought he was just out with the guys , " Judd thought . How he hated his curfew , his parents ' constant watch over his schoolwork , their criticizing his hair , his clothes , and his friends . Worst of all , he was grounded if he did n't get up for Sunday school and church every Sunday . Just the Sunday before , he had put up such a fuss that his mother had come into his room and sat on his bed . " Do n't you love Jesus anymore ? " she asked . What a stupid question , Judd thought . He did n't remember ever really loving Jesus . Oh , he had liked all the stories and knew a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was for little kids and old ladies . But what could he say to his mother ? " If you want the truth , I only go to church so I can go out on weekends and use the car . " That was clearly not what she had wanted to hear . " All right then , just forget it ! " she said . " I can stay home from church ? " " If you do n't want to go anywhere for a week . " Judd swore under his breath . It was a good thing his mother had n't heard that . He 'd have been grounded for life . In Sunday school , Judd copped an attitude . He wore clothes his parents only barely approved of , and he stayed as far away as possible from the " good " kids . What losers ! They never had any , fun . Judd did n't smile , did n't carry a Bible , did n't look at the teacher , did n't say anything . When the teacher asked his opinion of something , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there only because he had to be . In church , he slouched when his father was n't looking . He wanted to burrow within himself and just make it through to the end of the service . He did n't sing along , he did n't bow his head during prayer , he did n't shut his eyes . No one had ever said those were rules ; Judd was simply trying to be different from everyone else . He was way too cool for this stuff . As usual , Pastor Vernon Billings got off on his kick about what he called the Rapture . " Someday , " he said , " Jesus will return to take his followers to heaven . Those who have received him will disappear in the time it takes to blink your eye . We will disappear right in front of disbelieving people . Wo n't that be a great day for us and a horrifying one for them ? " The kindly old pastor talked about how important it was for everyone to be sure of his own standing before God and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might not be ready . Judd 's little secret was that he had never really believed any of that . He 'd had enough chances . At vacation Bible school , his friends had prayed and received Christ . He was embarrassed . He told them he had already done that at home . At camp a few years later , Judd felt guilty and sinful when a young speaker talked about church kids who were n't really Christian believers . He had wanted to go forward ; he really had . But he had also just been named Camper of the Week for memorizing a bunch of Bible verses and being the fastest to look up some others . What would people say ? Judd knew he did n't have to go forward or talk with anyone to receive Christ . He knew he could do it by himself . He could pray sincerely and ask God to forgive his sins and make Jesus the Lord of his life . But later , when the meeting was over and the emotion wore off , he told himself that was something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he was twelve years old and many of his Sunday school classmates signed up to be baptized . Their teacher and Pastor Billings made clear to them that this was an act of obeying Christ , a step taken by Christians to declare themselves followers of Jesus . As the students were baptized , they were asked to tell about when they had received Christ . Judd had done the unthinkable . He had quoted Scripture and made up a story about when he had become a Christian " once by myself at camp . " He felt guilty about that for weeks , never having the guts to tell his parents or his Sunday school teacher . Yet something kept him from confessing to God and getting things right with Christ . Now he was sixteen and had feelings and thoughts he believed no one would understand . He was bored with his church , frustrated with his parents , and secretly proud that he was n't really part of the church crowd . He went because he had to , but someday soon he would make his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Judd Thompson Jr . had his ticket to freedom . He had seen his dad get cash with his credit card at the bank and at the automatic teller machines . And he knew that almost anything could be paid for with that magic card . Of course , one day the bill would come and his parents would be able to trace where he had been . But he could put a lot of miles between himself and them in the meantime . For several days , Judd saved cash , withdrawing as much as he could each day from the automatic teller machine . He hid the money with the passport he had gotten the year before when his father took him along on a business trip to Asia . He had been miserable on that trip and let his dad know it every chance he got . Judd Sr. had finally given up trying to convince Judd Jr . that this was " the opportunity of a lifetime . " Secretly Judd had to admit that he enjoyed the hotels , the meals , and even learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and languages . But he was n't about to tell his dad that . Judd knew Dad had dragged him along only to get him away from his new friends , the ones his mother called the " evil influences . " It was also supposed to be a time for him and his dad to bondwhatever that meant . Dad had tried , Judd had to give him that , but there had been no bonding . Mostly it was just Judd scowling , complaining , arguing , and begging to go home . At least he got a passport out of the deal . That , along with his new driver 's license and the credit card , gave him what he thought was complete freedom . A friend had told him he looked old enough to pass for twenty-one and that he should get a fake identification card that would allow him to buy liquor in Illinois . It was cheaper and easier than he thought to get both his driver 's license and his passport copied with a new birth date . His plan was to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some night . He would take the first flight he could get to another English-speaking country . Beyond that , his plan was not clear . One thing was sure : He was n't going to bum around begging for a place to stay . He would live first-class all the way . Now Judd was a criminal . He told himself he was n't scared . Breaking the law only made him bolder about his plan , and he began making up reasons why he had to get away from home as soon as possible . As he made his plans , Judd became more and more angry . He disagreed with everything his parents did or said . He was mean and sarcastic . One day after school his little brother came into his room . " What do you want ? " Judd asked Marc . " I just wanted to ask you a question . Are you still a Christian ? " Judd lied . " Of course , " he said . " What 's it to you ? " " I was just wonderin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acting like one . " " Why do n't you get out of here and mind your own business ! " " Will you be mad at me if I pray for you ? " " Do n't waste your breath . " " You 're makin ' Mom cry , you know that ? " " She should n't waste her tears either . " " Judd , what 's the matter ? You used to care " " Out ! Get out ! " Marc looked pale and tearful as he left . Judd shook his head , disgusted , and told himself Marc would be a lot better off when he outgrew his stupidity . I used to be just like that , Judd thought . What a wuss ! Judd stuffed some of his favorite clothes in his book bag and jogged downstairs . " And where do you think you 're going , mister ? " his mother said . Did she always have to talk like that ? Could n't she just ask a simple question ? " I 'm going to the library to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there till closing , so do n't wait up for me . " " Since when did you get interested in studying ? " his mother asked . " You said you wanted my grades to improve ! " " You do n't need to go to the library to study , Judd . Why do n't you stay here and " " I need some peace and quiet , all right ? " " What will you do for dinner ? " " I 'll get something out . " " Do you need some money ? " " No ! Now leave me alone ! " " All right ! Just go ! But do n't be late ! " " Mom ! I already told you ! I 'm staying till closing , so " " Do n't wait up , yeah , I know . Are you meeting someone there ? " " No ! " " I 'd better not find out you 've been out with your friends , young man .... " But Judd was already out the door . * * * At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left early in the evening and was scheduled to arrive in London the following morning . His phony identification cards worked perfectly , and he enjoyed being referred to as Mr. Thompson . His first-class ticket was very expensive , but it was the only seat left on the 747 . Judd knew it would n't be long before his parents started looking for him . They would discover his car at the airport , and they would quickly find his name on the passenger list of the Pan-Con flight . He 'd better enjoy this freedom while he could , he decided . He would try to hide in England for as long as possible , but even if he was found and hauled back to the United States , he hoped he would have made his point . What was his point , exactly , he wondered . That he needed his freedom . Yeah , that was it . He needed to be able to make some decisions on his own , to be treated like an adult . He did n't want to be told what to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know that he was able to get along in the world on his own . Going to London by himself , based on his own plans , ought to prove that . Judd sat on the aisle . On the other side of the aisle sat a middle-aged man who had three drinks set before him . Beyond him , in the window seat , a younger man sat hunched over his laptop computer . Judd was stunned at the beauty of the flight attendant , whose name badge read " Hattie . " He 'd never known anyone with that name , but he could n't work up the courage to say so . He was excited and pleased with himself when she did n't even ask to see any identification when she offered him champagne . " How much ? " he asked . " It 's free in first class , Mr. Thompson , " she said . He had tried champagne a few times and did n't like it , but he liked the idea of its sitting on the tray table in front of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his way to London for important meetings . Captain Rayford Steele came over the intercom , announcing their flight path and altitude and saying he expected to arrive at Heathrow Airport at six in the morning . Judd Thompson Jr . could n't wait . This was already the most exciting night of his life .
