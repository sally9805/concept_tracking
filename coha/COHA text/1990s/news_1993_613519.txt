<p> Preventive medicine : Officials predict a health-care system that provides a financial incentive to keep patients from getting sick . <p> Frank B. Murphy , the top man at Atlanta 's most expensive hospital , has looked into the 21st century and seen a health-care system turned upside down . <p> In the new world of medicine , Murphy 's West Paces Medical Center and many other metro Atlanta hospitals will reverse their strategy : Where they once made millions by admitting as many patients as they could , they soon will be hustling to see how many they can keep out . <p> The public is still waiting to hear the details of the Clinton administration 's plan to change the American health-care system . But many of Atlanta 's hospitals and businesses , which have long lagged behind the national evolution toward a more competitive system , are quietly proceeding with their own reforms . <p> They are looking at a future filled with mergers and hospital closings , and a day when doctors ' private practices are replaced by networks of doctors and hospitals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and doctors - rather than insurance companies - assume the financial risk that the people they cover might come down with an expensive illness . <p> So do n't be surprised if the billboards along Atlanta 's interstates - the ones that urge you to do something about your back pain , your sports injury or that nagging sleep disorder - soon greet you with a different message : You feel great ! <p> ' Who 's going to survive ? ' <p> " The president is going to meaningfully reform health care , " said Murphy , whose for-profit hospital is part of the HCA chain . " Who 's going to make the money ? Who 's going to survive ? Who 's going to be the strongest ? We think we are . " <p> Murphy argues that one of the reasons his hospital is the most expensive is that it already has moved toward a new approach , under which it limits admissions to patients who really need care ; borderline cases get outpatient care and go home . <p> West Paces is in the midst of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven to nine institutions that could perform every service from " prenatal education to post-mortem counseling . " <p> In exchange for a fixed fee paid to the hospital network every year or every month , the hospital would provide all the care the patient needed - whether it was nothing more than one visit for the flu or a coronary bypass . <p> The " customers " covered by these plans would have to go to doctors and hospitals who are members of the network . <p> Under such a system , doctors and hospitals for the first time will have a financial incentive to do whatever they can to keep their patients from getting sick . <p> Inpatient charges will continue to be high , Murphy said , but fewer people will get admitted . Hospitals will become " large intensive-care units , " and , as a result , the overall costs for health care will be lowered , he said . <p> " We 've devised a strategy to become the best value in Atlanta , " said Dr. John A. Anderson , West Paces ' vice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other end of the hospital-cost spectrum , Atlanta 's cheapest institution - Grady Memorial Hospital - is plotting its own strategy for survival . <p> Changes in the health-care system likely will bring coverage to everyone . <p> " There will be economic empowerment where all patients will carry a national health security card , or a tax voucher or credit , " said Donald Snell , Grady 's acting president and chief executive officer . " Patients are going to have choices . . . . We have been restructuring to become one of the survivors and one of the dominant players in Atlanta . " <p> Hospitals such as Grady , considered a last resort for people with private insurance , will have to work to become attractive for the quality or cost of their care . And like others , it will make money both by keeping people out or by getting them out of the hospital as quickly as possible in the event that they do get sick . <p> " In managed care or managed competition , or any system where the risk is shifted from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the institution to keep you well enough to keep you out of the hospital , " Snell said . " The health-care futurists are saying that by the year 2000 we will need just 50 percent of the beds we have now . " <p> With the formation of networks and the need for fewer hospital beds , Atlanta 's hospital landscape may be dramatically altered in coming years . <p> " What is coming to Atlanta is what has come to many other marketplaces , " Snell said . " It 's what the health-care industry calls ' merger mania . ' " <p> In a few years , Atlanta 's many separate hospitals will be a smaller group that probably will be organized into three or four hospital networks . Northside , St. Joseph 's and doctors in the " Pill Hill " area of north Atlanta may form their own network , which may compete with an Emory University network and a Northwest system made up primarily of Cobb County hospitals . <p> " Those systems , " Snell said , " are going to compete with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ability to demonstrate improved outcomes , and I mean statistically , rather than the marketing information and the hype . " <p> Charges vs. costs <p> The absence of true competition in Atlanta has created a health-care marketplace in which bills bear little relationship to the cost of providing care and where charges vary widely for the same procedures , according to a Journal-Constitution analysis of charges on more than 500,000 bills for treatment at Georgia hospitals during 1990 , 1991 and 1992 . <p> Metro hospitals have not had to justify charges and costs , in part because of the attitude of Atlanta 's businesses , patients and insurance companies . <p> " We have n't acted like customers , " said Sandra Person Burns , director of the Atlanta Healthcare Alliance , a coalition of businesses . <p> In many other large cities , businesses and insurers started questioning hospital charges in the early 1980s with the arrival of health maintenance organizations ( HMOs ) . <p> " Atlanta has successfully , for years , kept managed care out of the marketplace , " said Snell . <p> Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , compared with 75 percent of residents in metropolitan Minneapolis , which started the transformation of its health-care system a decade ago . <p> Four major HMOs operate in Minneapolis after hospital mergers and acquisitions during the past decade put a number of institutions out of businesses . <p> Nonetheless , large employers there are only now beginning to use the data they 've been collecting for years , information that will equip them to negotiate rates based on hard facts about quality and costs . <p> Coming to Atlanta <p> Through the Healthcare Alliance , Atlanta businesses are just beginning to collect the sort of information they need to evaluate hospitals . <p> Still , it may not take Atlanta 10 years to catch up with Minneapolis . Hospital administrators are working on the formation of networks of hospitals and doctors , and businesses are preparing to negotiate a new way of doing business . <p> " There is some goods news in the fact that the Southeast is late to managed care , " said Burns .
