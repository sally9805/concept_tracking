<p> At Vanity Fair 's Oscar party last year , Morton 's restaurant became so choked with people  --  balding billionaires , actresses with plunging necklines and silicone-enhanced poitrines , studio heads and their entourages , gawking advertisers trying to look nonchalant and the ephemeral characters who circumnavigate Hollywood society  --  that at midnight the Los Angeles fire marshals stormed in and took action . <p> The marshals commandeered the guest list and became the de facto bouncers for the rest of the evening , pushing back the spectators packing the sidewalks of Melrose Boulevard , moving the 200 members of the press clustered hungrily outside on the driveway , and allowing guests like Matt Damon and Minnie Driver into the party  --  one by one , like regular folks . <p> " There was a crush at the door , " Graydon Carter , the magazine 's editor , said a year later . " It did get a bit ' Day of the Locusts ' out there . " <p> Call it simply a sweaty celebrity scrum , but Vanity Fair 's Oscar party  --  held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awards at Morton 's in West Hollywood  --  embodies the magazine 's happy symbiosis with Hollywood . It is a relationship so strong that not only does Mr. Carter celebrate Hollywood , but the day before the Oscars , Barry Diller  --  the chairman of USA Networks and one of Hollywood 's premier movers and shakers  --  celebrates Mr. Carter , by having a lunch for him at the Diller estate in Malibu . Regular guests include the billionaire media kingpins Ronald O. Perelman and Edgar Bronfman Jr. , chief executive of the Seagram Company , which owns Universal Pictures . <p> The adoring back-scratching fest is a perfect metaphor for the three-way love affair involving Vanity Fair , the movie industry and advertisers . Everyone benefits . Fledgling stars get free publicity by appearing on the cover ; readers , in turn , are drawn to the magazine , thinking that they are witnessing the birth of the next big Hollywood supernova . ( And who could resist when the woman in question is swathed in little more than gauze or a skimpy strip of fur ? ) Advertisers share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stars receive the affirmation of some of the country 's wealthiest advertisers . To top it off , more than two dozen Vanity Fair articles have been optioned by Hollywood in the last few years , most of which have been or are being made into movies . <p> Mr. Carter took the reins at Vanity Fair from Tina Brown in 1992 , and the following year filled the social vacuum left on Oscar night by the death of the legendary agent Irving ( Swifty ) Lazar in 1993 . <p> " Somebody had to take over , and I figured it might as well be us , " he said in an interview in his office , two weeks before departing for Los Angeles with the 25 Vanity Fair factotums who put the finishing details on the evening . ( The decades-long Lazar tradition of holding Oscar-night parties at Spago died with him . And Mr. Carter says that in at least one departure from the Lazar style , he does not go around screaming at people to stay in their seats . ) <p> Donna Karan International is taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The company has produced a 128-page stand-alone insert , shrink-wrapped with the magazine 's annual Hollywood issue . Originally timed to coincide with the opening of the Donna Karan flagship store in Manhattan , the booklet is one of the largest single advertisements ever to appear associated with a magazine . <p> Mitchell B. Fox , Vanity Fair 's publisher , said the profit margin was slim on such a mammoth stand-alone insert but that the magazine benefited " when a prestigious company like Donna Karan chooses us to convey its largest single communication ever , " he said . Donna Karan , chairman of Donna Karan International , said she would not have produced the ad  --  which cost her company more than $1 million  --  if Vanity Fair had not been interested . <p> " For me , there was no choice but Vanity Fair , which reaches a huge audience of men and women , " she said . " And the Hollywood issue is a particularly powerful issue . The magazine stands for everything the clothes are about : personality , eclecticism , glamour , timelessness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transplanted Canadian , has come a long way since his shirt sleeve days at Spy magazine , the satiric and sometimes cruel monthly he founded with Kurt Andersen in 1986 and edited until 1991 . When Spy was at its peak in the late 1980 's , it made fun of people who used words like " glamour " and " timelessness " with any gravity : Frequent targets included Donald J. Trump , the gossip columnist Liz Smith and S. I. Newhouse Jr. , the chairman of Advance Publications , which owns Vanity Fair 's publisher , Conde Nast Publications . Now Mr. Carter has lunch with Mr. Trump . He enjoys a close friendship with Ms. Smith . And Mr. Newhouse  --  once caricatured in Spy blindfolded , holding a fistful of darts , standing before a dartboard littered with the names of Conde Nast editors  --  is now Mr. Carter 's boss . <p> Mr. Carter , who thinks of Vanity Fair and Spy as kindred spirits , now says , " Vanity Fair is Spy , with money . " And the Spy days are clearly water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to spare no expense when it comes to Vanity Fair , the success of which has conferred a ducal status upon Mr. Carter in the ranks of Conde Nast editors . <p> For example , Mr. Carter and the Vanity Fair staff photographer Annie Leibovitz recently renegotiated her salary . When Mr. Carter reported to Mr. Newhouse that he was hesitating over the small matter of an extra $250,000 for a five-year contract , Mr. Newhouse reportedly told Mr. Carter not to " nickel and dime " Ms. Leibovitz . Vanity Fair writers are also well paid ; Mr. Carter would not confirm the salaries of some of his higher-paid writers , but he said it was more than $400,000 and wriggled his eyebrows dramatically to emphasize that no Vanity Fair writer was getting , well , nickel and dimed . <p> The magazine 's success is not based on its Hollywood coverage alone ; it does depart from the Hollywood air-kiss formula . Sebastian Junger , author of " The Perfect Storm , " spent a month in Kosovo and wrote an article about the Serb conflict there in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a private investigator who has worked for President Clinton , appeared in the same issue as an essay on the origins of Billie Holiday 's song about lynching , " Strange Fruit . " James Wolcott delivers the kind of soul-withering criticism that sends novelists screaming into other careers . <p> In a decade when hype and infamy seem to sell magazines better than sweepstakes promotions or centerfold pinups , Vanity Fair has managed to attract the kind of press attention that sells covers , warms advertisers and cultivates what can best be described as a kind of palatable notoriety . When the magazine showcased Monica S. Lewinsky in a series of lush photographs by Herb Ritts in its July 1998 issue , for example , few people criticized Vanity Fair for its lack of decorum . <p> Instead , the network news anchors who led their broadcasts with the story , cable television pundits and newspaper editorial cartoonists blamed Ms. Lewinsky and her lawyer for their questionable taste . ( And Mr. Carter 's discretion was praised for his decision to put Ronald and Nancy Reagan on the cover instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reputation , which adds sizzle without damaging controversy . The magazine 's relationship with advertisers is close . Last year , Vanity Fair was host for promotional parties for the Gap 's Banana Republic chain , and Nautica Enterprises , then displayed pictures of grinning marketing executives at the front of the magazine similar to the magazine 's regular party pages . <p> In October , Vanity Fair published an article by an anonymous author praising the Gulfstream V jet ; a few pages away , the Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation ran an ad showing Nathan P. Myhrvold , the Microsoft Corporation 's chief technology officer , posing by a Gulfstream . When The Wall Street Journal reported that Mr. Myhrvold was the author of the article about the jet , a Vanity Fair spokeswoman defended what looked like shameless back-scratching as coincidence . <p> Gulfstream is a new advertiser with the magazine , as are companies as varied as the crystal maker Baccarat and Kinko 's , the chain of copy shops . More than 100 new advertisers flocked to Vanity Fair last year ; the magazine packed in 1,882 ad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steadily since 1994 and revenue topped $109 million in 1998 , according to the Publishers Information Bureau . Total paid circulation slipped 2 percent in the second half of 1998 , to 1.08 million . But the small decline does not seem to have affected advertisers , who covet the reader demographic : the median age is 37 , the average household income is $58,000 , and 70 percent are college-educated , according to Mediamark Research Inc . <p> Despite the near-middle-age median , Mr. Carter is focusing more and more on downy young movie stars . Vanity Fair 's covers are now seen as a first critical step toward stardom . Leslee Dart , a co-owner of PMK , a public relations firm that represents dozens of movie stars , calls the Vanity Fair cover " the brass ring on the Hollywood merry-go-round . " <p> " But it can also backfire , " she said . " I think it is all about timing .

" Movies synthesize the Zeitgeist in a way that newspapers ca n't , and that magazines try to do . <p> " Look at these young kids , " he said , pointing to his April cover . " They change the culture . When you get over the age of 35 , you do n't want the culture to change , you want it to stay exactly the way it was when you were , say , 33 . But if you do that , you get old . " <p> Jim Wiatt , the co-chairman of International Creative Management , the talent agency in Los Angeles , said movie stars were pleased to be blessed by the advertising community , which plays an increasingly important role in the film industry . " They are the most sought-after covers for a young star , " he said .

" <p> But Vanity Fair 's lust for celebrity and scandal seems to have exhausted another city where the magazine is host of an attention-getting party : Washington . For the last five years , the magazine has given a party after the White House Correspondent 's Dinner , a black-tie affair held in late spring by the White House Correspondents Association , to which the President is invited . <p> Stuart Powell , the current president of the association , said Vanity Fair was partly responsible for a " celebrity-zation " of the dinner , which he does not encourage . <p> " There is concern in the ranks of the correspondents that the Vanity Fair party gets a lot of coverage , and we do n't know that it 's the kind of coverage that underscores the purpose of our effort , or that Washington needs right now , " he said . And what if Ms. Lewinsky  --  who has said she will attend this year 's Vanity Fair Oscar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , courtesy of Vanity Fair , this year ? <p> " We rely on the good judgment of our colleagues to select guests who would be comfortable at a dinner where the agenda is really to honor the President , " Mr. Powell said . <p> Christopher Hitchens , the magazine 's flamboyant political columnist , scoffed at the criticism : " That dinner was in danger of dying on its feet . It was dismalness defined , mediocre in every way possible . You 'd find yourself at the end of the evening standing in a light rain wondering why you had bothered to rent a tuxedo .
