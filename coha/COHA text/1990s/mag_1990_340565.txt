Standing Tall <P> Residents of Louisiana 's " cancer alley "  --  the 120-km ( 75-mile ) stretch of the Mississippi River from Baton Rouge to New Orleans that is lined with 136 petrochemical plants and refineries  --  have learned to endure choking fumes , stunted gardens , contaminated crayfish and abnormally high rates of cancer and other ills . But with help from Janice Dickerson , of the New Orleans-based Gulf Coast Tenants Organization , they are no longer suffering in silence . <P> Since the early 1970s , Dickerson , 38 , has visited bungalows and trailer camps , tank farms and railroad sidings trying to alert cancer alley 's destitute inhabitants about the dangers of the area they live in . " Chemicals are n't racist or prejudiced , " she tells her listeners . " Eventually they will move into your community . To fight industry , all you 've got to do is get organized . " <P> Dickerson is no stranger to the blighted area . She grew up in Reveilletown , a farming community that abutted a chemical plant until it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action she instigated . A former captain in the corrections department , Dickerson began working full time for Gulf Coast in January and helped organize this week 's Second Great Louisiana March Against Poisons . " All we want , " she says , " is for the air and water to get cleaner so that it does n't pose a danger .

Instead , she found rotting garbage , old diapers and discarded furniture .

It has since become an annual event ; last fall more than 8,000 people bagged 158 tons of trash . And 24 other states now hold their own cleanups . <P> Maraniss , 40 , who worries about the damage that beach litter does to marine life , promotes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her message seems to be getting through . At least one oil company has banned Styrofoam cups on its drilling rigs in the Gulf . And next year Texas will require codes on plastic bottles to identify the type of material they are made of , a measure that will make recycling easier . <P> Protector for the Amazon <P> Jose Lutzenberger , an ecologically oriented agronomist , is Brazil 's most unflinching environmentalist . Lutzenberger aroused the anger of the administration of former President Jose Sarney by daring to declare publicly that the rest of the world had a legitimate interest in the fate of the Amazon rain forest . " If you set your homes on fire , it will threaten the homes of your neighbors , " Lutzenberger noted with simple eloquence . Because of his reputation for outspokenness , the international environmental community was dumbfounded in March , when newly inaugurated President Fernando Collor de Mello named Lutzenberger Secretary of the Environment .
