<p> One in a series of articles <p> Tibor is unusually sober at 10 p.m. , and he gets right to the point . " Should we talk to this guy ? " he asks his friends , gesturing toward an American reporter . " Or should we smash his face ? " <p> They stand outside the entrance to Club Godor  --  " the Basement "  --  a grimy bar flanked by boarded-up shops and a closed hotel on Szechenyi Utca , the main street of Miskolc . All three have the shaved skulls , muscle shirts , black boots and jeans that have come to symbolize juvenile violence in Europe . <p> An uneasy silence follows Tibor 's rhetorical question . But the answer  --  this time  --  turns out to be talk . " For no particular reason , " he says . <p> Almost everything about the lives of 19-year-old Tibor and his two 17-year-old friends , Kristian and Laszlo , is as arbitrary as their decision . Like millions of youngsters in the former Soviet bloc , they have been crushed by one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the lessons they learned in school or at home have become meaningless . Little remains of what they were led to expect in a world that was communist and totalitarian for half a century  --  until a single cataclysmic shift in 1989 abruptly made it capitalist and democratic . <p> If juvenile delinquency everywhere is rooted in the failure of social systems , then few generations have had more strikes against them than the youngsters who reached their teenage years in Eastern Europe when the Iron Curtain collapsed . <p> Every system has crashed here  --  the family , the schools , the economy , the government , the criminal justice structure . And from Miskolc to Moscow , the toll is an unprecedented explosion of crime by young people . <p> Tibor leads the way downstairs to the bar , where a heavy-metal number echoes thunderously off the black-painted walls . Skinheads eye a handful of Gypsy teenagers who sniff glue from paper bags . It would be difficult to understand the interpreter 's translation , as the three boys talk about themselves , if the account was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Kristian says , gulping down his third beer in 20 minutes . " Then we drink all night until we break something . That 's what we do every day and every night . "  --   --   --  <p> Before 1989 , Miskolc ( pronounced " Mish-cooltz " ) was considered a workers ' paradise . That is why many of its citizens  --  adults , as well young people  --  seem unhinged by its descent . <p> With a metropolitan population of 550,000 , Miskolc is Hungary 's second-largest city . Situated 120 miles northeast of Budapest near the frontiers of Slovakia and Ukraine , it used to be an important center of heavy industry . <p> The coal mines , steel mills and chemical plants of Miskolc were designed on the mammoth Soviet model , employing tens of thousands of people under one roof and providing them with cheap housing , copious free meals and woodsy vacation retreats in the nearby Bukk Hills . <p> Miskolc was famous throughout the communist bloc , where belching smokestacks were the emblems of urban success . <p> Today , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that has no use for industrial gigantism and its inefficient mills . " Every major mine and plant has been shut down , " says Janos Simko , deputy director of the labor department in Borsod County , which surrounds Miskolc . <p> The aimless young people of Miskolc , who would have been miners and machine operators five years ago , are part of the admission price to a modern economy . <p> It is a price that is being paid , with devastating consequences , all over the former Soviet Empire . <p> Across the eastern borders , the counterparts of Tibor and his friends drink themselves into nightly stupor  --  and break things  --  in scores of industrial centers that have suddenly dropped into economic oblivion : Ostrava in the Czech Republic , Nowa Huta in Poland , Rostock in eastern Germany , Kosice in Slovakia , the endless smokestack suburbs of Moscow . <p> " Quite simply , there is no more demand for our young people today than there is for our mines and factories , " says Miskolc economist Eva Kelemen . <p> In Borsod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago . By December 1993 , according to Simko , the figure stood at 74,000 . At the beginning of 1991 , fewer than 400 county high school graduates under 20 were reported to be jobless . By the end of 1993 , there were 9,470 . <p> When asked what chance a 19- year-old like Tibor has of finding work in Miskolc , Simko shakes his head . <p> " None at all , " he says . <p> Until this year , Hungary 's unemployed received help only if they had once held a job , a policy that excluded young people just out of school . Now , the young are eligible for a meager stipend of 8,000 forints per month ( about $ 75 ) , and that lasts only six months . <p> After that , it 's survival of the fittest . <p> " Our generation is obviously regarded as worthless , " says Peter Mezosi , an 18-year-old in Budapest . " So a lot of young people think it 's cool to commit crimes . Everybody needs money , and that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Janos Szabados , director of crime prevention on the National Police force  --  Hungary 's equivalent of the FBI  --  arrives late for an interview in Budapest . Two 15- year-old boys were picked up that morning , suspects in the rape and murder of a 55-year-old woman the previous night . <p> " Really young kids , " he says . " More and more , that 's where we are seeing the biggest increases in crime . " <p> In 1989 , according to Szabados , fewer than 500 youngsters under 16 were arrested in Hungary for serious criminal offenses . Three years later , the figure topped 4,000 . Among those under 24 , the number jumped from just over 30,000 to more than 51,000 , with epidemic increases in burglaries , car thefts , narcotics smuggling and assaults . <p> The overall crime rate more than doubled in both Borsod County and Budapest between 1988 and 1991 . In the same period , juvenile offenses increased an average of 123 percent a year . <p> An estimated 4,000 young people have joined skinhead gangs , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There 's too much of this scum in our country , " said one Miskolc skinhead , referring to Hungary 's 600,000 Gypsies . " They f  --  their sisters and daughters and make children who are too stupid to do anything but steal . " <p> Foreign university students , many of them Arab or Turk , also are common skinhead targets . " Robberies , racial assaults , gang- fights  --  it 's all here now , " Szabados says . " Just like America . . . . " <p> Szabados has been a cop for 24 years , working his way up from the flatfoot beat to detective , and then deputy director of the juvenile division , before rising to prevention chief in February . He has degrees in law and sociology and consults almost daily with colleagues in eastern Germany , the Czech Republic , Slovakia and Russia . <p> None of them , he admits , has a clear solution to the crisis that seems to be enveloping a generation . <p> What they agree on , Szabados says , is that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that its most prominent new symptom is substance abuse . <p> " In 1989 , you could hardly speak of a drug problem in this part of the world , " he says . " Since then , it has grown astronomically . " <p> Not far from Szabados ' office , Rakoczi Avenue cuts the Pest flatlands of the Hungarian capital in two . To the north lies the expensively renovated center of Budapest , alive with tourist cafes and boutiques . To the south is a crumbling 19th century residential quarter that has been taken over by streetwalkers and topless nightclubs . <p> Mikszath Square lies on the wrong side of the avenue . A somberly lit intersection where the buildings are still pocked with shell holes left by invading Russian tanks in 1956 , this is one of Central Europe 's new drug supermarkets . The dealers hang out at a battery of public telephones in the center of the square , and their clients  --  mostly under 20  --  cruise nearby coffee houses . <p> The hard stuff comes from organized crime syndicates in Turkey , Italy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corridor to consumers in Western Europe . Young Hungarians bring the soft stuff in from Holland , where it is legal . <p> Tibor Csontos , senior editor of IM , a magazine for teenagers , researched an article about the Mikszath narcotics trade recently and compiled a price list : A joint sells for around 500 forints ( $ 4.75 ) . A gram of hashish or a paper tab infused with LSD  --  " very popular , " says Csontos  --  goes for 1,000 forints . Heroin runs 5,000 forints per gram and cocaine 10,000 forints . <p> " To put these costs in perspective , " he says , " you have to understand that the average salary here , before taxes , is approximately 25,000 forints per month . Less than $ 240. "  --   --   --  <p> The drug market , say those who work with the young , has flourished in direct proportion to the system 's collapse . Its rise is the mirror image of decline in virtually every social institution on which teenagers normally depend for guidance  --  starting with the family . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of parents who have appeared amid this chaos . They call them " maximalists . " <p> " Such people go for the biggest , the best , the most ostentatious of everything , including the children 's allowances , " explains Sandy Shaw , a Canadian teacher in Budapest . <p> " Ambition drives them , and flashy spending is its primary symbol , " Shaw says . " They can afford cocaine for themselves and give their kids enough money to get drunk every night and buy hash and acid , whether they realize that 's where it 's going or not . " <p> Market studies suggest that 10 percent of Hungarians have grown wealthy under capitalism  --  a proportion that appears to be fairly uniform across Eastern and Central Europe . These people now account for more than half of consumer spending . <p> But the maximalists are not the only parents who unwittingly bankroll their youngsters ' troubles . <p> " Often you can not distinguish between young offenders on the basis of their parents ' means , " Szabados says . " In poor families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get by today , and they have little time for their teenagers . To compensate , they give them as much pocket money as they can . " <p> Once , the decline of the nuclear family might have been cushioned by alternative public or private social institutions . Today , those institutions are also in precipitous decline . <p> " Institutional life has been torn apart not once , but twice , in our countries , " says Hungarian social historian Jozsa Hevizi . " First , the old traditional ties  --  with churches , for example  --  were destroyed by the state under communism . Now , communism and the mass organizations it created are gone , too . " <p> In 1989 , 1.2 million Hungarians belonged to the Communist Young Pioneers . The Pioneers still exist on paper , but their membership has declined to 69,000 . <p> " We 're trying to rebuild the old institutions , but young people are n't interested in them , " Hevizi says . " In their place , there is only a void . " <p> Csontos sees it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , defined by communist or prewar institutions and ideas , these kids are assembling their own universe , because nothing else seems to fit them . " <p> In the process , the symbols of juvenile delinquency  --  contempt for the past , the law and social propriety  --  are often elevated into a deliberate lifestyle . Its rules are derived from Western , and mainly American , influences that dominate television and advertising all over Eastern Europe . <p> This is the imported lens through which youngsters here have come to understand each other . <p> " Skins are into heavy metal , " 17-year-old Laszlo had explained at Club Basement in Miskolc . " When you hear it , you know we 'll be around . " <p> Budapest 's Peter Mezosi and his friends , who are members of a band called " War Pigs , " have borrowed quite another idiom . They favor oversized high-top sneakers , baggy shirts , baseball caps worn backwards and skateboards . The sides of their heads are shaved . <p> Their music , according to Peter , " is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Its American models , he says , are Public Enemy , famous for its menacing rap lyrics , and Iggy Pop , creator of " stage diving , " in which performers literally throw themselves into the audience . <p> Each of these borrowings speaks to the fury that is endemic among Hungary 's young . But neither is as chilling as the emergence of the " tomb dwellers . " <p> These are youngsters who break into cemeteries , vandalize graves and throw drug and drinking parties in mausoleums . They dress entirely in black and often pierce their cheeks and lips with metal pins affixed to Satanist icons . <p> *  --   --  <p> Nineteen-year-old Marta Moka has a simple way of separating the winners from the losers among her fellow teenagers . " The ones who have a future studied English , " she explains . " The skinheads , tomb dwellers and thieves studied Russian . " <p> Schooling is another of the arbitrary tricks that history has played on the young people of Eastern Europe . Before 1990 , all students in the communist bloc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language courses was strictly limited . <p> But in Hungary and most of its neighbors today , Russian is virtually useless . By contrast , those who speak English or another Western European language tend to have jobs . More than $ 7 billion in Western investment has poured into Hungary since communism 's collapse , and the demand for translators is enormous . <p> Marta , who works as a secretary for a Budapest export firm , is one of the half-lucky ones , trained in Italian . " Not as valuable as English , " she says , " but at least it got me a job . " <p> The vagaries of the educational system extend far beyond language training . " History , sociology , economics , political science , law : Everything the old system offered them was either full of lies or has become useless , " says historian Hevizi . <p> " And the worst part is that there is n't the money in our schools to replace everything quickly , " she adds . " In many places , students are being taught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that were around under communism . " <p> " The children of 1989 , of our revolution , are still being educated for the Hungary of 1980 , " echoes Balazs Furjes , one of the country 's best-known young leaders . " The schools are factories for the unemployed , for the lost . " <p> Then an impassioned teenager , in 1988 Furjes founded the Organization of High School Students , which stood at the barricades in the regime 's final days . Now 22 , he heads the youth wing of the Federation of Young Democrats , a political party that until recently barred members age 35 and older . <p> But today , he says , it is almost impossible to involve younger Hungarians in the political process . " What has happened in the past four years has given them a bad picture of democracy , " Furjes says . " That worries me very much . " <p> In the scant distance between 22 and 18  --  between political activist Balazs Furjes and the bitter street kids of Miskolc and Budapest  --  the crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The people who believed they were changing things for the better , making a real revolution , wound up disappointed , " says teenager Peter Mezosi .
