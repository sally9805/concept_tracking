The still-life paintings of KYLE JAMES STEVENS offer ordinary objects the chance to enter the realm of the revered . <p> " You can teach someone to paint , but to capture the essence of a subject is beyond the craft , " proclaims oil painter Kyle James Stevens . To convey a story with an array of everyday objects is of paramount importance to this New York City artist , who believes that when a painting reflects both the image the eye beholds and the spirit behind the hand wielding the brush , it can be as satisfying to the viewer 's senses as the smell of freshly brewed coffee on a cold winter morning . <p> The stretch between the ordinary and the sublime is not an easy one , but by following the lead of the Old Masters , Stevens has found meaning and strength in his voice as a contemporary artist . When he looks at a painting by Rembrandt , Caravaggio , or Vermeer , he says he can " feel the presence of these painters . They moved beyond the obvious and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show a view ; they expressed a feeling . " <p> While the Old Masters tinkered with lighting , color , texture , and composition to masterfully express the scenes before them , establishing an artistic focus was what really mattered to these 17th-century painters , contends Stevens . Like his predecessors , he sets his sights on a story he wants to tell or a mood he longs to convey  --  and then finds a way to do so . " It 's all about developing an idea or theme , " he explains . " Whether it 's a complex still life or a simple setup of onions and garlic on a marble shelf , " Stevens emphasizes , " I like all my paintings  --  no matter how small  --  to say something . " <p> Once he sits down to work , Stevens and know exactly what I want to do , " says the artist . A working title helps him clarify the painting 's focus . " I begin most of my still lifes by arranging the objects in a way that tells a story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achieve compositional balance , relying mainly on what looks good to me , " he adds . " In Learning to Sting , I composed an action figure of a cybernetic ape alongside a jar of honey on a table . The glass container revealed a reflection of me doing the painting , and a bee was poised on the rim . I strategically directed several push-pins , the ape 's outstretched hand , and an arrowlike abstract shape in the right comer toward a bulls-eye on the wall in the background . When asked by onlookers , I said the painting represented the bee learning to sting , but at the time I was angry and frustrated at someone in my life . The painting was really about me learning to take control . " <p> For Three of a Kind One of Another , Stevens faced the challenge of arranging and painting an assortment of more traditional subject matter . The artist reflects , " Each onion was alike yet different ; some had roots still attached ; some showed more red or yellow . When I arranged them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each of us may look different , but we all share a common humanity . I felt if I could portray an onion as having personality and character , then I would go beyond just rendering a photographic image of a vegetable . In this particular instance , to keep the viewer 's eye in the painting , I placed the object of strongest contrast  --  the white garlic clove  --  near the center , away from the edge of the painting . Its stem , almost like a pointer , is angled toward the two onions , keeping the viewer 's eye moving in a left-to-right direction . The painting was so simple that I knew in order to make it successful I would have to concentrate on lighting , object placement , and detail to emphasize the differences between the onions . " <p> Although Stevens prefers to work in daylight , he frequently uses artificial lighting with a daylight bulb so that he can work at night . Like the Old Masters , he uses a single light source , angled from the side and slightly above the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darks and vice versa ) and , according to the artist , " create a sense of drama . " Keeping his goal in mind , he does a light charcoal sketch on Belgian linen or gessoed Masonite . Then , using burnt umber mixed with turpentine and a No. 3 or 5 filbert bristle brush , he lays in the major shapes and objects to create an overall value pattern . " Getting the value range under way early on is important because it 's the glue of the painting , " says the artist . He generally sticks to earth tones while completing the underpainting  --  unless the subject matter dictates more vibrant color  --  and always begins with the area or object that has the most influence in the painting . " In Three of a Kind One of Another , I knew the background would set the stage and have a tremendous impact on the values of the onions and garlic , so I established the darks there immediately , " he explains . <p> Paint quality and application is especially important to Stevens . " Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ background , " he says . " But the only way to attain paint quality is to have paint . You do n't have to use tons of it , but you have to apply the right amount to get the right effect . " The secret to Stevens , rich dark backgrounds can also be found in his choice of colors . His palette consists of white lead , cadmium and earth yellows , cadmium and earth reds , alizarin crimson , light red , Venetian red , cerulean , cobalt and ultramarine blue , ivory black , burnt and raw sienna , and yellow ochre . Using a No. 7 bristle brush , the artist applies a layer of pigment mixed with medium to his painting surface . " My backgrounds often consist of reds , blues , and yellows , so too much blending can create a muddy appearance , " the artist concedes . But by using the subject 's complement and other cool and warm pigments , in addition to black , Stevens avoids the potential hazards of a large dark area . He also varies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which enables him to lighten or darken the value , intensify or decrease the chroma , and achieve subtle gradations . While working on $kthe background , he uses the tip of the brush to remove textural distractions and telltale to brushstrokes , allowing the darks to recede , creating a sense of depth and atmosphere . <p> Stevens allows the underpainting to thoroughly dry before beginning the next stage , which involves adding more detail and texture . " I establish texture as I perceive it , " he says . For example , when painting something as delicate as a rose , he does n't use a lot of paint . Instead , he gently blends numerous thin layers of pigment . " I try to capture the visual aspect of the inherent nature of the object through color and paint application , " he explains . " If I 'm painting a lemon that 's been sliced in half , I want the viewer not only to perceive the texture of the fruit but also to sense its bitterness . " <p> The artist reserves the last stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is at this point that he determines whether the painting is a success . " If I was trying to do a painting about color and the color is muddy , then it 's not a very successful painting , " he says . " Although some might argue about the meaning of success , to me it 's about whether I 've achieved whatever I 'd set out to do . " <p> Stevens , who teaches privately , lives with his wife , Stephanie , in Brooklyn Heights , New York . He received his B.F.A . degree from the University of Mississippi in Oxford . The artist later attended the Art Students League of New York in New York City and studied under David Leffel .
