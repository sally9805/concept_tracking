For five days , the negotiators , exhausted and increasingly needy of fresh shirts , darted between Washington 's Park Hyatt and ANA hotels , from conference room to mezzanine , hallway to bedroom conference call . Every so often , rumpled lawyers would emerge with wildly divergent claims about the progress of the fractious tobacco talks : a settlement was imminent , negotiators had hit the worst impasse since the start of deliberations on April 3 , talks were on the brink of collapse . Wait ! There 's a settlement ! ( Well , almost ... ) Finally , at 3:30 p.m. last Friday , a chorus of state attorneys general gathered around a microphone in the ANA 's ballroom to congratulate themselves on what Mississippi 's Michael Moore called " the most historic public-health achievement in history . " <P> Although the attorneys general talked as though they had just cured cancer , in truth they may have done the next best thing . They forced the tobacco industry to concede , in so many grudging words and so many , many more dollars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philip Morris Companies , RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. , B.A.T . Industries PLC 's Brown &; Williamson and Loews Corp . ' s Lorillard  --  reached a resolution with the attorneys general of nearly 40 states in which the industry will pay out $368.5 billion over the next quarter-century in compensation , drastically alter their marketing programs and submit to the regulatory heel of the FDA . <P> The money , divvied out in annual payments starting at $10 billion and rising eventually to $15 billion , in perpetuity , will be used to compensate states for health-care costs related to treating smokers , pay individuals who successfully press suit , finance health research and promote education programs aimed at deterring youths from taking up the evil weed . To that end , Joe Camel will soon become a has-been and the Marlboro Man will be put out to pasture , because the industry also agreed to sweeping reforms that proscribe the use of human or cartoon forms in advertising . Billboards , stadium signs , T-shirt giveaways and other promotional freebies are forbidden ; so are product placements in films @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the attorneys general and the public-health community  --  including the American Heart Association , the American Cancer Society and the American Medical Association  --  to cut smoking among youngsters , which has been on the rise . In fact , if the number of teenage puffers does n't decline by 50% within seven years , the industry will be subject to additional penalties . " Only the discovery of major vaccines , " said Massachusetts ' Scott Harshbarger , president of the National Association of Attorneys General , " could rival what this proposal promises to accomplish . " <P> That seemingly breathless assessment is backed by dismaying statistics that spurred the attorneys general to consensus . According to the Centers for Disease Control , each day in America 6,000 teenagers light up their first cigarette ; 3,000 teens enter the ranks of " regular smokers , " meaning they 've smoked at least one cigarette a day for a month ; and 1,000 adults die prematurely as a direct result of a decision made in adolescence to take up smoking . All told , 400,000 Americans die each year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Richard Blumenthal , " we 're losing lives every day we do n't stop this . "
