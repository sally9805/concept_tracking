Drawn northward from Latin America to better habitat , these tropical pig-like creatures have adapted well to the arid Southwest . <p> JERRY DAY looked into the abandoned mine with trepidation . Day and his colleagues from the Arizona Game and Fish Department had found a herd of javelinas that had taken refuge in the mine from the hot Sonoran Desert sun . Day was selected to enter the mine and drive the animals out into nets so they could be captured , given radio collars , and released for study . <p> " I could n't see a thing " inside the tunnel , says Day , a retired wildlife biologist , " but I could hear the adults clacking their teeth as a warning . " Suddenly , the javelinas bolted past Day , out of the mine , and through the netting . " We never did catch any of them , " he says . <p> Long before that day two years ago , Day and other American scientists had caught and followed javelinas , the most often seen large animals in national parks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known about javelinas comes from field studies in the United States . From such research derives insights into how a basically tropical animal has adapted to a hot , dry habitat . An Exodus North <p> Javelinas , or collared peccaries , are pig-like animals that now range from Arizona , southern New Mexico , and southern Texas to northern Argentina and Uruguay . They inhabit diverse habitats from desert scrub and chaparral to dry woodlands and dense rainforests . They also occupy low valleys and canyons as well as mountains up to 8,000 feet . <p> The smallest of three peccaries , all native to the Americas , adult javelinas stand about 18 inches tall and weigh up to 55 pounds . The white-lipped peccary , which ranges from southernmost Mexico to northern Argentina , reaches 85 pounds . And the Chacoan peccary tips the scale at nearly 100 pounds . It is found only in the Gran Chaco , a desert-scrub region of Paraguay , northern Argentina , and southeastern Bolivia . <p> Overhunting and loss of habitat have hit peccaries hard . Once thought extinct , the endangered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappeared from huge tracts where they were once abundant , " says Andrew Taber , a wildlife biologist and Bolivia program officer for the wildlife Conservation Society in New York . But new parks in Bolivia and Paraguay offer hope for the Chacoan peccary . <p> Elsewhere , hunting and destruction of Latin America 's rainforests pose problems for the white-lipped and , to a lesser extent , collared peccaries . " They are disappearing quickly in Central America , " reports Eduardo Carrillo , a professor at Costa Rica 's National University in San Jose . <p> Although the animals are losing habitat in Central America , collared peccaries , at least , are gaining in the Southwestern United States . Common today , javelinas were unknown in Arizona when Europeans first arrived three centuries ago , Day says . No bones , relics , or art evidence has been found among Indian archaeological sites that date before 1700 . The first reports of javelinas date from 19th century trappers who wrote about " river hogs . " Day thinks the animals followed the San Pedro River and other waterways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Now , javelinas are found throughout the Sonoran Desert and north in Arizona from Flagstaff to Kingman . In the desert , they occupy all habitats from cactus and desert scrub to chaparral and juniper-pinyon woodlands . " They are a very adaptable species , " Day says . <p> At first glance , peccaries look and act much like Old World pigs , hogs , and boars . Like swine , peccaries have large heads that end in a tough , disk-shaped snout ideal for rooting in the ground for food . Both pigs and peccaries have long bristly hair , protruding canines , and a tendency to grunt and snort a lot . <p> But pigs and peccaries are only distantly related , having shared a common ancestor some 40 million years ago . A closer look reveals differences . Domestic pigs and wild boars have 44 teeth ; peccaries have only 38 . The canines of pigs are often elaborately curved ; those of peccaries are short and straight . <p> Peccaries also have a scent gland on their backs just forward from the tail , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oily fluid to mark territory and identify fellow herd members . Early Spanish missionaries , noting the smell , called javelinas they saw in Mexico " musk hogs . " <p> The javelina 's presence in Arizona and the southwestern United States raises some interesting questions . How has an animal that lives primarily in rainforests adapted to the arid Southwest ? Why has this tropical animal been able to invade the Sonoran Desert only recently ? And how has the desert affected javelina behavior ? Masters of Versatility <p> For starters , the javelinas ' adaptability was aided by white settlers whose cattle overgrazed the Southwest 's dry grasslands , says Tice Supplee , who heads the Arizona Game and Fish Department 's game branch . In Arizona , mesquite , palo verde , cholla cactus , and prickly pear replaced native grasses , spreading the scrub habitat javelinas prefer in the United States and Mexico . <p> State biologists also helped javelinas spread northward . To give hunters another game animal , they transplanted javelinas into western and northwestern Arizona from the 1 1950s to the early 1970s . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , " but they probably would have gotten there anyway . " <p> Maybe , but javelinas have undergone few physiological changes that would adapt them to life in a desert . They can not , for example , reduce the water content of their urine or feces like some desert rodents , says Stamatis Zervanos , a biologist at Penn State University 's Berks campus in Reading . <p> On the other hand , javelinas undergo an annual molt . Typically mostly black haired with speckles of gray and white underneath , javelinas drop the black-tipped outer bristles as temperatures rise in the spring By summer , they appear more gray or even white in spots . ( Light colors reflect heat better than dark ones . ) The black-tipped bristles regrow as autumn temperatures drop . <p> Physiology aside , most changes javelinas have made to deal with the desert are behavioral , Days says . Normally active during daylight throughout most of their range , javelinas in Arizona bed down by 9 a.m. when temperatures head toward the 90s and 100s . They usually do not become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the weather cools , active periods stretch later in mornings and begin earlier in afternoons . By winter , activity patterns are reversed from those of summer . Whereas rest takes up nearly 80 percent of a javelina 's daytime in hot weather , during winter it accounts for only 12 percent , Day says . Similarly , feeding and moving total 72 percent of a javelina 's time at night in summer , but only 19 percent in winter . <p> Likewise , javelinas change how they rest . In winter , when nighttime temperatures may drop near or below freezing in the desert , the animals sleep or rest huddled together for warmth . Youngsters even clamber over adults to squeeze between the larger animals . In summer , each javelina scrapes out a cool spot on the ground for itself . A Rough Diet <p> More than heat , though , the lack of water represents a problem for javelinas . Although rain falls more regularly than in other North American deserts , the Sonoran features searing days and long periods with little or no precipitation . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arizona , rainfall averages only 11 inches a year . Farther west at Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument near Ajo , only 8 inches of rain fall annually , and yet farther west at Yuma , a mere 3 inches . The mountains around Tucson get more rain , but still average only 13 inches a year . <p> As tropical animals , javelinas need water . They can not go long periods without it . In some areas , thirsty javelinas visit human-made water tanks built for cattle . In others , natural springs can slake the animals ' thirst . For the most part , though , Day says , javelinas survive droughts by switching from their preferred foods  --  acorns and other nuts , the beans of palo verde , mesquite , and other trees , roots , bulbs , grasses , and herbs  --  to a diet of prickly pear cactus . Javelinas also tear the leaves off agave or century plants ( also called shin daggers for their leaves ' sharp edges ) and lechuguilla to get at the soft hearts inside . <p> Like all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succulents . They absorb huge amounts of water after rains , then store the moisture for dry times ahead . The prickly pear pads or cladophylls , as branches that look like leaves are called , may be 80 percent water at their peak . <p> More than just water , prickly pears provide food for javelinas year-round . The animals eat not only the pads , but also in season the reddish-purple fruit and yellow flowers . At Big Bend National Park in Texas , prickly pears account for two-thirds of javelinas ' diets , says John Bissonette , leader of the Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit at Utah State University . <p> Although prickly pear cactus may help javelinas survive long , arid summers , the plant 's pads are not their preferred food . " It 's a maintenance food they can fall back on during droughts , " says Bissonette . <p> In fact , adds Lyle Sowls , a retired University of Arizona wildlife biologist , prickly pear pads contain little protein and few nutrients . Javelinas forced to subsist on them often lose weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause metabolic problems , kidney stones , and even kidney failure . <p> To eat a spine-covered prickly pear pad , a the sometimes knocks it to the ground , says Robert Lochmiller , a zoologist at Oklahoma State University . Holding the pad with its foot , the javelina pushes it with its disk-tipped snout to break off the long , sharp spines . It then eats the watery pulp inside . Just as often , though , the animal will simply break off part of the pad and eat it spines and all . <p> Javelinas sometimes raid pack rat dens in winter in search of stored seeds . They even occasionally eat insects and other invertebrates as well as carrion , Day says , although far less commonly than do feral pigs . A Park Attraction <p> Meanwhile , it is a cold climate , not heat or water , that will likely limit the javelinas ' range in northern Arizona . Being tropical animals , they lack insulating underfur or fat layers that more northerly mammals use to keep warm in winter . Some javelinas travel up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in summer , but most return to lower levels as temperatures drop . In Texas , the northern extension of the javelinas ' range correlates with contiguous prickly pear growth , Bissonette says . <p> In some parts of Arizona and Texas , javelinas have become pests . They often stroll into outlying areas of cities looking for food . " They 'll clean out any garden , " Supplee warns . " They love to root for tulip bulbs . We advise people to plant less succulent flowers and install solar-powered electric fences . " <p> Rather than pests , javelinas are often a prime tourist attraction in national parks . At Big Bend National Park , for example , they are " part of a visitor 's viewing experience , " says Raymond Skiles , the park 's wildlife resource manager . " We consider them to be a natural part of the Texas scrub habitat . " <p> At Saguaro , the biggest concern is human-javelina contact . Margaret Weesner , chief of resource management at the park , says that some people feed the animals , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a herd of javelinas beds down within view of the park 's visitor center , and Weesner says , " It gives us a chance to talk to visitors about not feeding them . " <p> Big Bend 's Skiles warns park visitors to be wary of javelinas . Although attacks are rare , javelinas are ornery critters with sharp canines and poor eyesight , and will go after any food or water left outside . And , if they perceive danger nearby , they might charge first and ask questions later . They have been known to force bobcats up saguaros , send coyotes running , and even kill domestic dogs . <p> Despite such ferocity , Day views javelinas as fascinating animals . " I could just sit for hours and watch them , " he says . <p> Perhaps it is their looks that attracts interest . " They are not the most gorgeous animals in the world , " Bissonette says , quickly adding : " But they have a fundamental beauty about them .
