<p> If Marian Graff Palmer were an actress instead of the exceptional cook she is , she 'd receive her standing ovations before the performance . As it is , when her family assembles , they 're effusive in their praise well before they partake of her traditional dishes for Rosh Hashanah , the Jewish New Year , which begins next Wednesday evening . <p> Each of her children , grandchildren and great-grandchildren is partial to one or another of her many recipes . And whenever the family gets together , Palmer , who is 86 , makes each person 's favorite dish . <p> It is this spirit and generosity that moved her family to nominate her for House Special . <p> " Family and friends have been amazed with the culinary talents of Marian Graff Palmer , " wrote her granddaughter Kim Schwartz , with her relatives ' contributions . <p> " Many households have had the great pleasure of partaking in her wonderful feasts . Families celebrating bar mitzvahs and weddings plead for her to make the challahs for the special blessing . Her recipes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and original . <p> " It is time that a woman of this culinary stature is honored by all those who love her and have enjoyed her outstanding cookery , " the letter continued . <p> It was obvious from the descriptions of sweet-and-sour meatballs , challah ( egg bread ) , chicken soup with kreplach ( dumpling ) , stuffed veal breast and cabbage rolls that Palmer loves to cook for Jewish holidays , so , during a recent visit to her North Side apartment , I asked if she prepares anything special for Rosh Hashanah . <p> " Does she ? " asked some of her family , who joined us for the interview . <p> " Her gefilte fish ca n't be beat , " said her daughter , Letty Abel , starting the list . <p> " There 's always chopped liver , sweet-and-sour meatballs , homemade challah , rice with mushrooms and onions , and prune tzimmes , " added her son Gary Graff . <p> " It 's simple to make tzimmes .

Grandma makes it all because each one likes a different thing and takes it home , " Schwartz said . <p> In fact , that 's an ongoing family joke . Everyone gets a care package of leftovers of his or her favorite food . Gary seals his shut so no one can sneak a bite . Palmer 's supply of aluminum foil containers rivals that of some caterers and carry-out restaurants . To make sure the larder is well-stocked , she has a second refrigerator in her bedroom . <p> " But even that is stuffed , " she said , displaying the neat shelves of cooked , packaged food . <p> Marian , who grew up in Englewood , comes from a family of great South Side cooks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew about her cooking . There were three or four great ladies in the family who cooked wonderful traditional foods , but no one cooked like mother , " Gary Graff said . <p> Palmer recalled her mother as a fine cook and inspiration . <p> " She used to bake cakes and send them to the synagogue , " she said . " I used to be involved in fund-raising benefits and did a lot of cooking . " <p> Now Palmer devotes her culinary efforts to her three children , their children and 13 great-grandchildren . <p> She taught her daughter how to make her famous kreplach and her daughter-in-law to make challah . <p> Rosh Hashanah is an important time for the family to gather . On the first night , everyone eats a light meal before attending synagogue services . Palmer does n't cook on the holiday but prepares enough ahead of time to be reheated and served throughout the new year 's observance ( The Graff family observes two days of Rosh Hashanah ; some families observe one day . ) <p> In recent years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hashanah , or Palmer will cook in her own apartment and bring the food to Abel 's home . <p> When Palmer is asked how she does it all , she gives her pat response : " I do n't know from Tuesday ; I just cook . " <p> " It keeps us close . She 'll say , ' Come for Friday night dinner , come for Sunday dinner , " Eileen Graff said . <p> And does Palmer have a favorite Jewish holiday to cook for ? <p> " Every holiday is a favorite day to cook for the family , " she said . <p> Here are four of her recipes to assure a sweet new year .
