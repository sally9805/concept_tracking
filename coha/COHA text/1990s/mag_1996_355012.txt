Once again in Moscow after three years . First impression : the city looks better . I tell this to my Moscow friends . They are pleased . The Russians set great store by how foreigners view them . In their opinions they seek the answer to one of the most fundamental Russian questions , which recently was freshly formulated by the excellent Russian essayist Natalya Ivanovna : " Will Russia join ' the civilized world , ' or will it continue along its separate path , which even today is deemed perilous by other nations ? " <P> In the course of the past decade , the city has lived through three different epochs . First , that of perestroika and glasnost . At that time , in the second half of the 1980s , Moscow was transformed into a huge debating club , into a unique , peculiar Hyde Park . For the first time , there was freedom of speech . One could finally talk , express opinions . And one could write the truth . Dozens of newspapers and periodicals appeared ; the print @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . People bought these things , read them , collected them . Today in the cramped , cluttered apartments of intellectuals , against walls , on windowsills , on top of closets , lean stacks of dusty clippings and books from that era , like so much abandoned and sad-looking military debris in a field where a battle was once fought . <P> Then came the second period  --  the dissolution of the Soviet Union , capitalism 's first steps . People in the West are surprised that so many Russians do n't like capitalism . But there is nothing extraordinary about this . The capitalism that came to Russia at the start of the 1990s looked different from the one constructed in Europe several centuries ago . The capitalism of Holland or Switzerland was laboriously created by the industrious and thrifty bourgeois of Rotterdam or Geneva , for whom perseverance , honesty and modesty were religious commandments , acts of faith . <P> But the advance guard of the capitalism that arrived in Moscow was armies of speculators , barons of the black market , gangs of drug dealers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mafias . People were terrified . It is not capitalism per se but the form in which it first appeared that supplied Communists with fresh followers . I remember walking around Moscow with my friend Syoma . The city was cold and dirty . One could easily break one 's leg because the sidewalks , uncleared for months , were covered with mountains of ice . The squares and the streets near train and subway stations overflowed with vendors peddling rubbish , anything to make a living . In the clumsy stalls were bottles of whiskey , packs of chewing gum , piles of sunglasses . That is what the new regime offered the citizens of this great but impoverished city . Syoma , depressed and resigned , told me how twice he had tried to open a small shop and twice had to give up in the face of the mafia 's demands , which he was unable to satisfy . He barely got away with his life ! This dark and dangerous epoch came to an end in the fall of 1993 with the dramatic and bloody confrontation at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
