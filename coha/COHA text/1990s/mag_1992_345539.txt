Ozone depletion is cause for caution , but it 's no reason to stay barricaded indoors or put on an astronaut suit before venturing outside . Excessive exposure to the sun 's ultraviolet ( UV ) rays has always been dangerous ; the ozone problem just adds to the risk . Says NASA 's Michael Kurylo : " We 're not talking about a single exposure to a death ray . It takes repeated exposure over long periods of time . " <P> Even if there were no atmospheric damage , an estimated one-sixth of all Americans would still develop skin cancer during their lifetime . Most cases are curable , if detected early . The 4% to 8% loss of ozone over the past decade could raise the risk at least 15% . A significant increase in cataracts , which now afflict 1 of every 10 Americans , could also occur . <P> As the ozone depletion gets worse , health risks will rise , but the odds of getting cancer or cataracts can be dramatically reduced by following guidelines that doctors recommended long before ozone depletion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When out in the sun for prolonged periods , wear protective clothing . That means choosing fabrics that have a tight weave and donning a wide-brimmed hat . A baseball cap is not adequate because it leaves the delicate rims of the ears exposed . <P>  --  In summer , when comfort calls for shorts and T shirts , use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with a sun protection factor of at least 15 . <P>  --  Minimize the time spent in the sun between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m . <P>  --  Wear sunglasses when outdoors in bright sunlight . Ask for ones that are treated to absorb UV radiation or that meet the American National Standards Institute Guidelines for eye wear . Poorly designed sunglasses that do not block UV rays could do more harm than good . Under dark lenses , the pupils dilate , making it easier for UV light to damage the delicate membrane of the retina.
