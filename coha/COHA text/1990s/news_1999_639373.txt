<p> When the fifth-graders heard slavery still exists in Africa , they wanted to wipe it out . <p> Their efforts inspired the biggest abolition movement since the U.S. Civil War , bringing instant fame to their red-brick public school amid shopping strips and apartments in Aurora . <p> But today , the 50 Highline Community School students are facing a different fate : condemnation for , it appears , unwittingly encouraging the slavery they oppose . <p> Their campaign - buying more than 1,000 slaves in war-torn Sudan , then freeing them - may have coincided with increased slave trading , a Denver Post assessment has found . <p> The head of a Sudanese relief agency and a U.S. congressman warn that infusions of Western money for slave " redemptions " may motivate both slave raids and scams . Good idea , bad result <p> Leaders of major New York-based human-rights groups this month called the Colorado campaign misguided and urged the schoolchildren - who boosted anti-slavery fund-raising worldwide and appeared on national television shows - to stop their buybacks immediately . <p> " The payment ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Stephen Lewis , deputy executive director of the United Nations Children 's Fund , who had a message for the children : <p> " Please reconsider . We think it 's not a good idea . We have some alternatives to suggest to you to fulfill that intense sense you have that you want to deal with injustice toward other children . " <p> The children 's teacher , 48-year-old Barb Vogel , wants to press ahead , given the failure of U.S. government , United Nations and human-rights agencies to do much about African slavery . <p> Yet Vogel said she will leave the decision on buybacks to her students this fall . If she must , Vogel told The Post , she will venture into Sudan herself to try to find out what 's happening . <p> " I want to help my children , " she said , " and I want to help those people - in any way that I can . " Children identify with peers <p> All this started in February 1998 , when Vogel read her fifth-graders a newspaper story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their carpeted classroom " family " area , the children listened raptly as Vogel spoke about boys and girls snatched away from their mothers and fathers . <p> It was the worst thing the kids , mostly 10-year-olds , could imagine . Some of them , including boys who hate to cry , began sobbing as they heard about slave raiders marching captive children across deserts , forcing them into almost inconceivable drudgery , mutilation and rape . <p> The students seized on information in the story that some people were trying to redeem slaves with money . The children decided to help . Vogel , a 27-year teaching veteran , backed them up . After all , Vogel reasoned , what 's more at the core of America than eradicating slavery ? <p> The children set up lemonade stands , babysat , sold old toys and diverted allowances to raise money . <p> Their effort - and the attention it drew - raised more than $ 50,000 that was sent to Switzerland-based Christian Solidarity International , a humanitarian group the students heard was buying the freedom of Africans . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secretly into Sudan , converts dollars to Sudanese pounds and hands over piles of the pounds to traders . These traders buy slaves in the north and take them secretly south , Eibner said . <p> Each time he bought and freed a slave , he notified the students and sent them photos . The children take credit for freeing more than 1,000 slaves and helping push Christian Solidarity 's total to 11,147 buybacks . Before the Colorado kids got involved , Eibner said , he had freed about 2,000 slaves . <p> Each time news of a buyback reached Colorado , eager young students such as Lindy deSpain painstakingly cut out another paper figure and pasted it up on the " freedom wall " in their classroom . <p> " You take some brown pieces of construction paper . We have these little people-tracing things . You trace around it and cut it out and color them in , " Lindy said earnestly . " We color clothes and some of the scars and things they might have . You have to make ' em look really proud that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are deeply moved by " that feeling of freeing someone again , to know they are happy and home , " deSpain said . " It 's like a feeling that words ca n't express . Like , so happy . It 's hard to explain . " Part of larger effort <p> U.S. Congress members , the American Civil Liberties Union and Colorado legislators sang the students ' praises . A flag flew over the U.S. Capitol this summer in honor of the Highline abolitionists . <p> More than 100 schools and more than 200 churches across the United States , Europe and Japan began contributing to slave buyback projects . <p> Vogel testified in Congress about slavery in Sudan . <p> Reps . Tom Tancredo , R-Colo. , and Donald Payne , D-N.J. , and Sen. Sam Brownback , R-Kan. , recently set out to visit Sudan . They have introduced legislation , in the House and the Senate , urging the United States to intervene militarily against Sudan 's Islamic government in the interests of stopping genocide . <p> In Sudan , slave trading is conducted in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 million people have died , and 4 million have been displaced , in the conflict , which pits Sudan 's educated Muslim north against impoverished Christian and animist cattle herders of the south , where Western companies hope to tap massive oilfields . <p> Slavery has existed in Sudan for centuries , as slavery exists across much of Africa 's Sahel region . Sahelian families falling on hard times traditionally have sold children who otherwise might starve , said Peter van Arsdale , a University of Denver anthropologist who has worked among Kababish nomads in Sudan . Abhorrent as slavery is to American eyes , some Sahelian families with no other option " could see servitude as a possible win-win situation economically , " van Arsdale said . <p> Human Rights Watch investigators accused the government of encouraging Arab raiders by giving transportation and weapons and allowing the raiders to keep whatever spoils of their raids might prove profitable . The raids are concentrated in the Bahr al Ghazal region occupied by Dinkas , a million-strong group that dominates southern Sudan and opposes government rule . <p> Dinka chiefs devised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enslaved relatives and herd them secretly home . In 1995 , Christian Solidarity 's Eibner stepped in with money to bolster this indigenous buyback system . <p> Now , with the Colorado students involved , Christian Solidarity can do a lot more , with a fund-raising income of $ 5.5 million in 1998 . On a single slave-buying trip this summer , Eibner purchased 1,783 bedraggled slaves , for an average of $ 50 a head , and declared each one free . <p> " We 've been able to expand the networks of retrievers , and we also cover a much larger area , " Eibner said , praising Vogel 's students as " the conscience of the nation . " <p> The money the children helped raise is staggering in the context of poverty in Sudan , where the government estimates the average person lives on less than $ 500 a year . The economic situation has given rise to questions about whether slave buybacks are encouraging rather than helping to eradicate African slavery . <p> Since early 1998 , slave raiding and trading has increased , Sudanese rebel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Liberation Army representatives say it 's hard to get precise numbers from village logbooks . Sudanese newspaper publisher Bona Malwal , a consultant to the rebels , said from his office in England that slave raids occur almost daily but " are neither increasing nor stopping . " Christian Solidarity International 's Eibner said slave taking increased in 1998 but has decreased this year . A double-edged sword <p> Leaders of major human-rights organizations contend slave trading not only is increasing but that the increases almost certainly are related to sudden availability of Western money for buybacks . <p> It 's like paying hostage takers ransom , they say , arguing that any payment lends credibility to the notion of buying and selling human beings . They say the money encourages scams , that freed slaves sometimes are left with nowhere to go because their families are dead . " If you can pay for more slaves , undoubtedly more slaves will be provided for you to pay for , " Lewis said at UNICEF headquarters . " There will be larger and larger numbers engaged in the raids and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market . It is important to realize that , in the context of Sudan , where there seem to be no limits to human ferocity , the slave trade is very great , and that if slaves are going to be purchased for significant amounts of money , there will be more slaves to be purchased . " ' Enhancing ' the slave trade <p> The buyback approach " is not eradicating slavery , it is enhancing it , " Manase Lomole Waya , director of Humanitarian Assistance for South Sudan , said from his base in Nairobi , Kenya . <p> " These good intentions are counterproductive , " Waya said . " The ( slave ) redemption exercise is not a solution to the slave trade in Sudan . Redemption is counterproductive . If somebody cares , the local people should be empowered to defend themselves against slave raiders . " <p> Evidence that buybacks boost slave-trade business may not be " scientific , " said Peter Takirambudde , executive director of the Human Rights Watch Africa Division . " We look at trends . We make reasonable inferences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a correlation between the sudden emergence of funds from abroad and the increase of people who appear to want to make a business out of slave redemption . " <p> A former leader of Christian Solidarity in the United States who now disavows slave buybacks , Jim Jacobson told The Post he changed his approach after a slave purchase last summer in Bahr al Ghazal . Soon after , he received a letter from a man in Sudan offering him many more slaves . " I just felt everything was not as it appeared to be , " Jacobson said . " You do n't know if after several days these groups of people get reabducted . " <p> Jacobson also said real prices of slaves are falling , from around $ 100 a head in the mid-1990s to less than $ 50 today - which he sees as evidence Sudanese people are responding to money by producing more and more slaves . <p> Eibner is undaunted , vowing to continue until a better system is in place . <p> " There 's no empirical evidence , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trading . <p> Critics relying on supply-and-demand arguments need to visit Sudan , he said . " The evidence is to the contrary . " <p> In the overall context of war and suffering , the debate about tactics for eradicating slavery is almost grotesque , Eibner said . Leaders of human-rights groups are " people who are big and powerful , and they abuse their position in society . " <p> If the U.S. government weighed in with a better effort for ending slavery and the war , he 'd quit the buybacks . <p> " But there has been a grossly inadequate response , " he said . " There are grave crimes against humanity being perpetrated - against innocent women and children . The war in Sudan has taken on genocidal proportion . " <p> Though the debate turned more and more on " evidence " that may not exist , the students moved ahead with their campaign this summer . <p> Student Charles Hayes assembled a record of the student project . <p> Lindy deSpain and Nicole Cimino wrote letters to celebrities , such as soccer star @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get involved . <p> Kourtney Sloan distributed slavery information packets at the Buckingham shopping mall and in apartment complexes . <p> Christine Manalastas is babysitting for $ 1 an hour and turning over her earnings to the classroom STOP ( Slavery That Oppresses People ) collection . <p> Thomas Turner diverted his lawn-mowing earnings , normally earmarked for his college-education savings account , into a white ceramic pig on his dresser for freeing African slaves . <p> This summer , Tancredo visited the children before going to Sudan with Payne and Brownback . Their fact-finding was n't conclusive on the impact of buying back slaves , Tancredo said after his trip . Results inconclusive <p> The bigger question for Tancredo is whether the U.S. government will do more to end slavery and the war . <p> Tancredo said he agrees with the children that the international response to African slavery is inadequate . <p> " Follow your heart " is the best advice he could offer the children . <p> " It is my impression that there 's certainly a case to be made that slave redemption could be counterproductive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is this : Until you have something viable to take its place , until you have some policy - and I ca n't think of any country other than the United States that would have the ability to affect change there - until you have some policy that could reduce or eliminate this phenomenon , I ca n't just go back to Barb Vogel and her kids and say , ' Stop doing this . " ' <p> The growing debate about the merits of buybacks has left Vogel deeply perplexed . <p> " Did the children and I ever think there would be this controversy ? " she said . " No . We saw human beings suffering . We wanted to help . It 's so simple for us . " She expects to be facing more questions , wants better information from Sudan , and is weighing whether to let U.N . and other critics visit her classroom to speak . " Would I be willing to look at alternative ways to help these people ? Absolutely . Yes . I just do n't want my kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meanwhile the children , hearing more of these criticisms from adults , are starting to weigh the evidence themselves . <p> They say they 're a little suspicious . After all , adults did n't do much about African slavery before . <p> For now , the children plan to continue with their buybacks and awareness campaign . <p> Stapling their cutouts one by one on the freedom wall " ' gives us courage , " said Charles Hayes , who overcame a speech impediment in this process and has begun to excel in both school and sports . <p> " Knowing that one more slave is free , " Charles said , " you just want to come back for more .
