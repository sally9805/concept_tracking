<p> A LITTLE AT A TIME <p> To lose a husband , a wife , a child , a parent : You , our readers , told us what it feels like . You also showed us something about how to move on . <p> Here we revisit some of the folks we talked to this year . The Sherrers Lynne and David Sherrer are ready for children again . <p> It has been barely a year since the Villa Rica couple lost their 6 1/2-year-old son , Brandon , to complications from spinal muscular atrophy , a genetic disease . This month , they were certified as foster parents and are awaiting another child . <p> " We did n't want our parenting skills to die with Brandon , " Lynne says . <p> The Sherrers had a rough time after their bright , bespectacled son died a year ago in October . Lynne , 28 , a student , checked into a hospital in grief and exhaustion . David , 36 , a mental health worker , went to the cemetery every day for eight months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , So Soon . " <p> The visits became somewhat less frequent last summer as he felt the emotional emptiness fade . ( He still goes twice a week . ) In September , Lynne and her therapist agreed that she no longer needed their counseling sessions . This fall , the Sherrers felt well enough to think about children again , and they applied as foster parents with Mentor , a therapeutic foster care agency in Atlanta . They want to re-enter family life gradually by taking children on weekends , giving full-time foster parents a respite . Maybe later they 'll adopt a child . <p> " I would n't mind a special-needs child , " says David , who is himself paraplegic . " After Brandon , none of that is strange to us . But , really , they 're all special-needs children to me ; they need good parenting . " <p> One of the reasons the Sherrers are n't quite ready for full-time parenting is that Lynne is very busy . This week , she will graduate from the State University of West Georgia with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next year . <p> " When Brandon died , I really did n't think I was going to survive , " she says . " But I did , and I became stronger . I feel like I can do anything now . I 'm pretty proud of myself . " <p> And she will always be proud of her son . Last spring , the Carrollton elementary school where he had attended first grade dedicated its yearbook to him . " I 'll always think of Brandon as 6 1/2 years old , " his mother says . " He 'll always live in my heart . " The Bensons So many readers contributed to the Benson Family Fund after reading about their two terminally ill girls in May that the family was able to purchase a new home in August . <p> The down payment on the beautiful DeKalb County two-story , with bone siding and green shutters , came from the donations of people who were touched by the family 's struggle to care for Shalonda , 12 , and LeSara , 11 . <p> With materials donated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Resnick , converted the garage into a pink-and-white bedroom for the girls , who are in wheelchairs . <p> " We are all comfortable , " said Yolanda Benson , the girls ' mother . " We love it here . It is so spacious . It is so peaceful . " <p> Her daughters , suffering from a fatal genetic disease called metachromatic leukodystrophy , continue to deteriorate . But LeSara , hospitalized briefly in October , celebrated a birthday on Thanksgiving Day . <p> " We can still get a smile out of her , " her mother said . <p> The Benson boys , Cleveland , 14 , Clevoris , 13 , and Alonzo Jr. , 9 , continue to entertain the girls  --  that is , when they are n't pestering them . Their father , Alonzo Sr. , has a new truck-driving job that allows him to spend five nights a week with his family . <p> " I 'm not that good at saying thank you , " he said . " But make sure you put a thank you in there for me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days a week as a medical assistant while her grandmother watches the girls . <p> " We are all still here , " she said . " We have been blessed . " Susan Esposito <p> Her once lush garden is strewn with brown leaves and barren twigs , remnants of a spring once full of life . And her house is on the market , awaiting someone to enjoy her dream . <p> When she planted it last spring , Susan Esposito knew it would take a couple of years for her little backyard oasis to blossom into maturity . That was just after doctors had told the 49-year-old former nurse that she had only a few months to live . <p> A consummate planner , she immediately began making arrangements for her funeral . But after learning of the costs , Esposito opted instead to invest in the garden of her dreams , hiring Atlanta garden designer Barbara Humphreys to create it . And , as Esposito had requested , her ashes were spread over the Virginia-Highland garden after her death July 25 . <p> She believed in talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her 3 1/2-year battle with cancer , but for helping others accept the inevitable . " She was very frank from the beginning about what was happening to her , " Humphreys said . " She said you just have to express your love for what 's important "  --  including a garden . <p> Esposito 's mother , Betty , plans to move to California to be near her son , Chris  --  but not before ensuring that her daughter 's dream is left in good hands . <p> She has a theory about why the place has n't sold : " My own feeling , " Betty Esposito said , " is that Susan 's not ready to let go of it . " <p> The garden may be drab now , but her daughter made sure it was filled with plenty of spring-blooming perennials that would be enjoyed for years to come . <p> " The flowers will come back , " her mother said . Nancy Fisher <p> A few things have changed since Nancy Fisher 's husband , Michael , was killed in a plane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shooting . She 's become a stock car race fan . And she 's shopping for her first Harley-Davidson . <p> In other words , she says jokingly , " I 've turned into a redneck . " <p> Actually , she 's turned into a new person . Since fate has taken away her co-pilot , she 's learned how to fly solo . <p> Dozens of Georgians contacted the 40-year-old mother of two after her story appeared in the newpaper in July . Many were women who felt similarly abandoned after losing a spouse . They discovered that , though some acquaintances were rocks of support , many friends cut them loose . " It was scary to hear how many women are sitting around Atlanta just like me , " says Nancy . <p> Faced with a season that many grieving survivors dread , she is also inventing a new Christmas for herself and her children , Peter , 6 , and Stuart , 9 . They 'll celebrate an untraditional holiday far from their Norcross home , on a warm beach somewhere : " Wherever Clark Howard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she and Michael 's colleagues at Manheim automobile auctions ( a subsidiary of Cox Enterprises ) , for whom he did much legal work , are planning a memorial for the " Fishman . " ( That 's what his friends called him ; his nephews called him " Uncle Fishie . " ) <p> It will be a million-dollar endowment to support the Sibley Heart Center at Egleston Children 's Hospital , to provide care for children whose families ca n't afford it . Michael Fisher had a heart defect that required surgery when he was 11 years old . He worked to overcome it , not dreaming that he would die in a far more capricious way . <p> The new Christmas plan and hobbies are emblems of Nancy Fisher 's determination to take charge of her life . She took shooting lessons , bought a 9 mm Glock handgun and secured a carrying permit , because she felt that she alone was responsible for protecting herself and her family . <p> These are n't necessarily happy developments , she says . Michael is never coming back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adds , " I feel incredibly more independent than I did initially . I feel like we can make it , we can do it , and I 'll be all right . And I know I can be by myself . Totally by myself . " Bill Hink <p> After his wife , Madelyn , died last year , Bill Hink took the bold step of selling their Carrollton house and moving into a recreational vehicle . " I figured I 'd be lonely no matter where I was , but at least I could get away from the reminders , " he said . <p> When we spoke with him in June , the 68-year-old gypsy was on his way to Minnesota and Canada , pointing his Ford diesel truck and his King of the Road trailer whichever way suited him . <p> Since then , Hink has made yet another dramatic change . On Nov. 6 , he married Marlys C. Penn in an outdoor ceremony near her home in Maitland , Fla . <p> The union , though sudden , was not between strangers . The Iowa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Marlys ( everybody calls her Molly ) was Madelyn 's freshman roommate . <p> The new Mrs. Hink , twice divorced and a confirmed single for the past 20 years , says she got a phone call out of the blue one Saturday afternoon this summer . <p> He said : " Molly , are n't you ever lonesome ? " She said : " No . I do n't have time to blow my nose hardly . " <p> It was a daunting answer , and Molly sounds contrite these days . " Oh , I should n't have cut him off at the knees , " she chuckles . <p> Despite that rough beginning , they hit it off . Just back from a Hawaiian honeymoon , they 've settled into Molly 's home , northeast of Orlando , where she bicycles and gardens and he tries to keep up with her . <p> " You 're going to have to start a new life sooner or later , so do it as soon as possible , " Bill advises . " Accept the idea that death is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . You have to take it in stride and build a new life . " Eugene Moore Eugene Moore celebrated his 90th birthday Nov. 19 , and the Adamsville-area resident has discovered that if you live long enough , you 'll lose a lot of friends . <p> His wife and best friend for 56 years , Gertie Moore , died in 1992 . His eight brothers and sisters have all passed away . One by one , his contemporaries have also gone on . When he joined Providence Missionary Baptist Church as a Morehouse College student , he was among the younger members ; now he 's the oldest man in the congregation . <p> Whether he 'll be reunited with Gertie in heaven , he 's not sure , but he 's not counting on it . " The older I get , the less I think about some that I was taught , " Moore says . All that Sunday School talk of going to heaven , he reasons , was partly to " give the poor man something to hope for . " <p> " Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my body ? Nobody knows where that 's going . " <p> Retired from teaching , tailoring and working at Lockheed , Eugene Moore 's hopes for the future are simple . He would like to visit Jerusalem , to " see some of those places I 've been reading about , " but doubts he 'll find the money to do it . His plan is to attend his deacon meetings , keep working on the hand-tailored clothes that he makes for friends , and play a little bridge . <p> " I 've had a pretty good life for a country boy , " he says . " I plan to live these last few years the best way I know . " Jim Auchmutey , Danny C. Flanders and Ann Hardie contributed to this article .
