<p> Cafe Escalera <p> Address : 130 Lincoln , Santa Fe , New Mexico . Open Monday through Saturday from 8:30 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. , Sunday 5 to 9 p.m . Full bar . MasterCard and Visa . Reservations accepted . ( 505 ) 989-8188 <p> TWO IMPORTANT Northern California chefs have opened a restaurant in Santa Fe called Cafe Escalera , giving San Franciscans one more reason to visit this outpost of Western-American culture . <p> Deborah Madison , who started Greens and wrote the classic vegetarian " Greens Cookbook , " and David Tanis , the former upstairs cafe chef at Chez Panisse , are turning out some of the loveliest meals south of Berkeley . The purity and simplicity of their cooking , transformed by meticulous technique and a deep understanding of what tastes good together , makes the food here so delicious . <p> There 's nothing particularly southwestern about Cafe Escalera and that may draw criticism . Brian Knox , a former partner of Mark Miller 's at the Coyote Cafe , put the restaurant together and insisted on simple , clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tall windows that let in lots of high desert light . High ceilings baffled with white canvas , white walls , sturdy , handmade blond wood tables , woven wicker chairs , and rust-and-yellow linoleum tile floors suggest abstractly the stunning Santa Fe landscape . <p> The menu takes advantage of Santa Fe 's enormous growth over the past 10 years as a culinary oasis , so that farmers and food suppliers make an effort to get their products to the area . One farmer trucks his organic produce 4 1/2 hours from Texas ; a local woman , who farms five miles by dirt road into a canyon , produces an array of beautiful dried heirloom beans off season , and exquisite herbs and vegetables during the summer . Excellent fresh fish is flown in daily . Local lamb and high quality beef and pork also are available . <p> One evening we were served a plate of pickled vegetables ( $ 2 ) in muted colors that looked like a still life , and an arugula salad ( $ 6.50 ) with prosciutto and the most luscious olive oil-soaked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , both white and whole wheat . Shaved fennel dressed in olive oil and lemon ( $ 7.50 ) came with smoked mussels and delicate smoked salmon . <p> A salad of romaine leaves ( $ 6.50 ) in a creamy anchovy vinaigrette with barely cooked eggs and Parmesan was a great turn on a Caesar . The most gorgeous asparagus , leek and turnip ragout ( $ 12.50 ) , starring juicy turnips with tender greens from the Texas farmer , worked wonderfully with cheese enriched soft polenta . Elegant , juicy chops and tenderloin of Haugen Ranch lamb ( $ 17.50 ) came with plump , flavor-infused , heirloom shell beans . You could n't wish for better food . <p> Madison , one of the most creative cooks in America , makes the desserts and they glow with her magic , yet her dishes never seem forced or showy . They knock you out , the ingredients can taste so amazingly good together . A tall glass of lemon milk sherbet ( $ 4.50 ) with lace cookies paved with poppy seeds was a taste sensation . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was completed by an orange caramel sauce , and she knows how much everyone loves Angel Food cake ( $ 4.50 ) . <p> In the morning , people sit at the wide bar , drinking caffe latte and nibbling the most exquisite cinnamon and nut-filled brioche rolls ( $ 2 ) . All this urbane pleasure happens in the middle of seeming nowhere . I could have eaten at Cafe Escalera for breakfast , lunch , and dinner every day of my stay with complete satisfaction . <p> One reason that quality restaurants can exist in Santa Fe at all is because of the ground-breaking work of people such as Miller , who opened his Coyote Cafe five years ago . While the southwestern flavors behind the cooking at this very stylish , folk-art filled restaurant were being explored by a handful of other chefs , most notably Stephen Pyles of the Routh Street Cafe in Dallas and Robert del Grande of Cafe Annie in Houston . Miller is the most conceptual . <p> As an anthropologist at UC Berkeley , he fell in love with Indian cultures and native @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Santa Fe Cafe on University Avenue in Berkeley , he started cooking with them . In addition , he has traveled all over Mexico , state by state , picking up knowledge of Mexican Indian cooking techniques . <p> The current menu at Coyote Cafe reads like a shopping list of Mexican and southwestern ingredients mixed and matched with California abandon . Practically every dish has an ethnic hook or is a stylized rendition of a traditional Mexican dish . One of the best dishes on the menu is an appetizer of airy buttermilk corn cakes topped with smoky , chipotle chili-marinated shrimp . <p> Just as good was a bowl of clams , as briny and fresh as any I 've had on the coast of New England , cooked with tomatoes , spicy andouille sausage and roasted garlic . A Tabasco-style chicken tamale turned out to a rather leaden square of cornmeal , tinted red with achiote , and stuffed with chicken  --  a whole meal rather than an appetizer . <p> Sea bass crusted in pinon or pine nuts ( $ 34 ) was absolutely delicious , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a huge mound of spinach , awash in what tasted like grapefruit juice that ruined them . A fussy chili relleno platter ( $ 27.50 ) with pob lano chilies filled with ratatouille , cornmeal-crusted Anaheim chilies filled with squash , two different astringent sauces in a yin-yang pattern and a little fried tamale or " sope , " all ended up tasting medicinal . For dessert , a coconut ice cream sundae with butter-rum sauce had melted together into a sweet soup ; pineapple banana sorbet was refreshing , scattered as it was with fresh fruit . Appetizer and dessert are included in the price of the huge main courses , so that a generous meal for two with a couple of glasses of well-chosen wine , such as La Provencale Jade Mountain 1990 ( $ 6 a glass ) , costs $ 80 . This felt quite reasonable to me , considering how elaborate the food and decor are . <p> However , I think that Miller , who is currently in Washington , D.C. , opening his multimillion-dollar Red Sage restaurant , has n't sat down at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat a meal . I ca n't imagine that he would have found those main courses at Coyote Cafe very satisfying . The food has become so conceptual that it has lost its soul . The dishes are exciting visually and read intriguingly on the menu , but they really do n't taste all that good . More 's the shame because I know that Miller can make food sing . <p> . <p> Inn of the Anasazi <p> Address : 113 Washington Avenue , Santa Fe New Mexico . Open every day for breakfast from 7 to 10:30 a.m. , lunch 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. , dinner 5:30 to 10 p.m . Full bar . All major credit cards . Reservations accepted . ( 505 ) 988-3236 . <p> For a more traditional version of Santa Fe style , I suggest breakfast at the Inn of the Anasazi , a small , new , richly designed hotel and restaurant in a remodeled state building just off the main plaza . Old Santa Fe is invoked in the painted adobe walls , low log ceiling , weathered plank floors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The dining room delivers luxurious comfort , but is still evocative of the rustic southwest . <p> The kitchen puts out some spectacular buckwheat flapjacks with molasses syrup ( $ 7 ) , a bowl of chili cheese corn grits ( $ 2.50 ) , scrambled eggs with crumbled bacon served in soft blue tacos ( $ 6.50 ) and some tasty granola ( $ 4.75 ) studded with toasted pinon and pumpkin seeds . Green chili duck hash with poached eggs ( $ 10.50 ) was a bowl of very vinegary duck stew that did n't taste good with morning eggs . The food is served on hand-thrown , black-and-white glazed pottery and the large soft cotton napkins feel like well-worn cowboy bandannas . <p> If all this talk about New Mexican cooking is making you hungry , you can get a similar breakfast at our Stanford Court where chef Larry Vito prepares blue corn waffles with honey-lime butter ( $ 8.25 ) , huevos rancheros with blue corn tortillas ( $ 12 ) , or Santa Fe scrambled eggs with green chili salsa ( $ 7.75 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of those good dishes with him .
