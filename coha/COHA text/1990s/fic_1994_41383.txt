I WOULD N'T TELL YOU if it was n't important . The lady keep saying talk it out , talk it out , but I ca n't talk to her . My mother come to see me and she telling me the opposite thing now . She telling me I should n't talk about it . She is a lady that know what she talking about because she living this life long , long though you would n't say so in years , but she know people in this place . Boy , I tell you , people ! <p> One set of people I do n't know hear the talk and come to tell me , try to forget , try to forget . But they do n't mean that . They shame for theyself , so they saying to me I imagine how you must be feeling shame . They want to reject me so they saying they know I must be feeling rejected . But once you overs people you overs that . Yes . Because in the same breath they telling me they hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me what they really want to say , which is I get what I was looking for . <p> But I not feeling guilty , I not feeling that neither . They want me to feel guilty , but that is one trip I not taking . Because when I look at it , all that really happen is that I dare to be the real woman , change that , the real person , they could never dare to be , no siree , no days ! So how come I sitting down in a hospital bed with a plastic band around my wrist and they outside ! <p> Jeez this place quiet ! So quiet you could hear your mind talking . <p> Listen , I went down Panorama . Because I is not a costume person . You see me ? Costume do n't appeal to me . Costume do n't touch me . I like to be plain , unless is something like the one with the set of cocoyea . And then I say , yeah . Because I see something I remember , something that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manzalina in the wide spaces and the gold and silver letting in the sea and the sun . You know what that look like ? It look like you sit down on the beach and you look out far , far and you only seeing water and sun twinkling on one another till you ca n't separate them and everything just sparkling and starry in broad daylight . <p> But I was telling you , I went down Panorama . Was n't me alone . Me and my three friends . No mind I still seventeen . Nothing wrong with that , was four of us . I mean , who go buy the ticket if we do n't go . Who go support the CDC , the pan , the culture , if we do n't go . Do n't mind all that crap I just let go . I went because , <p> I am a music lover Having soca fever This music inside me Driving me crazy <p> Taxi say it , not me . <p> Even now I hearing it in my head . Sometimes is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then sometimes again is a whole lot of things . It depend on the vein you touch . You know most people do n't understand that . That is why it will always have controversy about which music better than which and all that set of dotishness . Me ? I like all music and those that do n't strike me , is because they out of my range . That is all . <p> I mean , is not like Sparrow singing about something that happen , man , is something that happening singing itself . Not that Sparrow way do n't work too , but that happening to somebody else . That is why I suppose they does call Sparrow music classics , because it kind of delayed and thought out in poetry . But this , man , this happening to you right now , man , it not happening One Day or Yesterday . <p> But you not even hearing none of that today . Jeez this place quiet . <p> Like nothing not happening outside there . But I tell you do n't let that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I was saying four of us went down Panorama . If you see me . I alright looking , I mean , my body not bad . And I wearing a cut out shirt and a knee pants and I have my cap and my Kentucky wrist bag with my change and I gone . Jenny , she had on a denims and her green turtle neck jersey . That in fashion now . And the two fellars , let me see if I remember ? Say what ? Who does remember what men does have on . And we one . <p> But you see what my mind just say . Who does really remember what fellars does have on . Not so with them fellars though . You not marking them , but they marking you . And is some of those calypsonians , I sorry to say , that causing that . It have some of them living off of woman . Now do n't get me wrong , the tune might be nice , voice , everything , but check the words . <p> Girl , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THUNDER When I leggo Hamlet is MURDER You bong to SURRENDER <p> Nobody have a right to get away with that . But as I say , is women singing the song and buying the records . Do n't fool your fat ! That song telling men is alright to rape women , that they like it ! And do n't let no mischievous gamin smile , as my grandmother woulda say fool you . That is a serious , serious case , not even close to Clause Four and playful , playful like , they have women and all calling it surrender . But I have news for them , it have better surrender than that . Yes , now you know , I surrender already . <p> But wait let me finish . You know why women singing that song ? And note me well , it have a difference between song and music , if you catch my meaning . You know why women singing that song ? Is because it show them their power . If you listen to the thing right , is a man singing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of woman . Check the verses . She go surrender , yes , but that man not boss there . He not even equal . The poor man do n't know what to make of the woman , he ca n't touch her soul . But you see me ? To me , rape is like cutlash in water , as my grandmother woulda say . Once you ent dead , that is . <p> Then again , you have another kind of calypsonian . They singing for those men that could only see their wife , their girlfriend , their mother , their sister , cooking pelau and making sweetbread . They ca n't see them wining , as they call it . And the women and them so stupid , they stifle their nature till they lose it . Then those men self turn round and say their women ca n't wine , as they call it , and ups and gone out in the band to find the women that could wine , as they call it . <p> Sometimes a composer have music and he do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he do n't have music . Sometimes a thing making music and some of them ca n't make music with it and they does pay the penalty for that , because the music telling them what to do and they trying to betray the music and the music does ditch them after a while . <p> But you know the bottom line in all this ? Once people stop noticing this thing they calling wine , all of that done . Then we could stop talking about obscenity and promiscuity and immorality and all that crap and then we could concentrate on the music and let we soul flow . That is why I land up right here on this hospital bed . Because people do n't understand that . <p> So I there in the North Stand , because that is where you hear the best . First I hear a rumble and that introduce the straight , straight melody . And while I listening to the melody I get lorse up a chromatic , and it carry me to the top of three octaves and leave me there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they climb up , da de da de da , and I on the top trilling like bird on top of telephone wire , for how long , I do n't know , and I looking down , and is how to get down , but just then the base come and take me down and steal me away , and before you know it I down and getting ready to rise again , because the climax ent reach yet . And I know I have to go up again and again and again , in how many fashions , I do n't know yet , but I know each time going to be sweeter , all I know is that I going up in a minor this time , and I rising and I flirting with a bit of jazz , and then the cellopan milking , milking the joy in the sadness , and I could just see the swing of the baseman waist , and I up in the air again ... <p> And then all I hearing is Boom Boom , and I coming down fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up at all this time , right in front of me is a whole set of boys , a gang of boys , about ten or twelve boys , and now I only hearing Boom Boom , and I looking around for Jenny and I ca n't see Jenny , nor Eon nor Wayne , and I only hearing Boom Boom Boom and I sure it ai n't Boogsie because it ent music no more , but I ent sure what it is , it could be my heart because I ai n't jumping no more , as a matter of fact I ent even sure my foot on the ground , because I ca n't look round now , is only these fellars , and I only hearing BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM . <p> And then is no longer boys , I only smelling , and then I start feeling their bracelet and earing and I do n't know what else , because the place done dark already , I only seeing more dark , and now I only feeling board , yes , like board under my back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and faces closing in and out , and out and in , and is like different masks , in and out and out and in , and like I lorse all feeling , and is only the boards under my back going BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM , and all over like I gone dead and no music nowhere now , only BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM ... <p> And then I hear a big ray like everything explode , and then the jumping stop and I hear people talking and I look around , because like I is ding dong dell , centre of the well , and then I get up and look down at me , because everybody looking down at me , and I see I ent have a stitch of clothes on me , and I start to run , and I running and I only feeling the minty heat of cold sweat all over my skin as I going through the night air , and I running and I running , and a police man stop me , and then ... I wake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know for sure is that is not the music that violate me . <p> Jeez this place quiet . Like they misplace the mortuary . <p> I feel glad that Jenny and Wayne and Eon come and see me . It nice to know that your friends ent give you up because something bad happen to you . At first I was feeling like my whole body was on fire . But that gone now . Once somebody radio way playing Carol 's Pressure , <p> Have you ever tried to understand Society 's done for every day woman Can anybody ever imagine What does go on behind every grin Well if you really want to know The pressures we undergo As we sit alone Cock you ears and listen well While this story I will tell , How we woman strong <p> At first it used to kind of soothe me like . She talk a good piece of feeling there , but after a while , like it was n't good enough . I come to find like she kind of give up . I know what she talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I not inheriting that . <p> In between time I did latch on to the Black Stalin . Now , it have plenty people that do n't like Black Stalin music and you have to give the man his full name . But you see that devil he does play ? It does come a time for everyone that they does understand it , <p> JAH-D-OH ! JAH-D-OH ! Judgement morning Ah by the gate and ah waiting Because ah begging the master Gime a work with Peter For dem sinners coming Because I go be dealing Because the things that they do me I want to fix them personally PETER , WAIT ... PETER , WAIT ... <p> Is a natural , natural feeling to want to burn they ass in truth . And I getting ready to stand with both of them by the gate with my red gown and pitch fork even if I have to jump in after them too . But then I study I go miss ' 88 and when I think about it , that little bit of justice ent worth it . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Jeez this place quiet . <p> I ready to go home , yes ! I want to go home and play my own music . <p> CALYPSO ! CALYPSO-O ! Calypso music ... <p> The Massachusetts Review <p> Singing YEA YEA YEA YEA YEA YEA YEA YEA CALYPSO ! <p> I could just hear David rasping it and I shivering and I shuddering and my belly rumbling .
