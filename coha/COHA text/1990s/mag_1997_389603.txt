A total of 79 gowns were auctioned off for charity at Christie 's in Manhattan , bringing in an average of more than $41,000 per dress . This may not have caused sticker shock for buyers from the Franklin Mint or the Fashion Cafe , who appreciate the promotional value of Di 's raiment , or for that anonymous female executive who paid $670,800 for 13 gowns . But many of the 1,100 bidders had never even been to an auction before .
