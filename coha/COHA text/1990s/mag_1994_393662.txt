" AWARD OF DISTINCTION SCHOOL FOR AMERICAN CRAFTS " The words of advice I would give the Rochester Institute of Technology and the School for American Craftsmen is to realize that the world changes . The one thing that we ca n't do is to become content with ourselves . We must move and change with the world . Move in the vanguard of what the world is pushing you toward .

" The Next Best Thing " I guess I guess a lot of the time . It goes without saying sometimes I feel words slipping out of their meanings . Then there are the combinations . I know I 'm getting warm when I 'm overlapping an ordinary activity with an event that has no visible means of support . It is cooking , or at least the loss of control growing a garden can show , and listening to the news on the radio about the pilot who tries to land his Cessna on the White House lawn and hits President Jackson 's magnolia on the back of the 20-dollar bill . If you look , look for the tall one to the left . When I did , it occurred to me  --  no wonder we wonder about making art when we can take a tree out of our pocket and invent an event in our hand .

" My basic philosophy has developed during a period of 60 years teaching and working in wood and other craft media . Wood , with its diversity , color , grain , texture and defects , is intriguing and constantly fascinating . Each piece is like a human finger-print  --  no two alike , each with its own beauty . " The design of a piece need not be modern or traditional for its own sake . Instead , design should be a simplified whole that balances or contrasts against a plain surface . I have moved in the direction of achieving a pure and unadorned style , containing a sense of proportion and perfect balance between material , purpose and contour .

The recognition and value of such an accolade reside in the fact that it was determined by colleagues from various disciplines and design philosophies . To have that acknowledged response and resonance within a community of artists is quite reassuring . " In reflecting upon my activities over the years , I never imagined the scope or dimension of the metamorphosis that has taken place . My involvement with metal has evolved from the goldsmith 's discipline , focusing on bodily adornment , to large-scale forged iron and architectural ornamentation , and to cast and fabricated sculpture . Although scale , process and applications have changed , the nature and excitement of the creative process remain fundamental . My awareness as manifested in the work has been primarily directed toward the personalization of the object , thereby embodying an intimacy of response through empathy .

It is a privilege to be considered among many of those artists , and I would like to pay tribute to those before-c me who expanded American ceramics to what it is today .

" It now seems a miracle that these craft artists persisted , despite their isolation not only from the public but from each other , and despite he fact that mass production rang up all the sales and garnered all the attention through lavish advertising and publicity campaigns . But awareness of this expression finally spread among the public as the objects passed from hand to hand . The passion put into the object was transferred to the owner : tactility became a new alertness . Following the visual and tactile response came a deeper emotional-intellectual involvement : the one-of-a-kind object is inherently personal , the rapport intimate .
