Cleve Francis is packing up his guitar and kissing the honky tonk joints goodbye . Talk about luck . In the year since he signed his history-making record deal , this Virginia cardiologist is about to become an overnight sensation in a musical field where Black folks are scarcer than a pair of cowboy boots at Gucci 's  --  country and western . Not since Charlie Pride broke the race barrier in the ' ' 60s has a major record label signed a Black artist who sang the sound of the Grand Ol ' Opry . But Dr. Francis  --  whose $25,000 investment into filming his first music video landed him a sweet singing contract  --  intends to demonstrate early on that his record deal with Liberty Records , formerly Capitol Nashville Records , is no fluke . After all , the Medical College of Virginia graduate has been singing country since he was just a poor kid in Jennings , La. , who could n't even afford to buy a guitar . " I made a guitar out of a cigar box and the window screen wire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the event that marked the inauguration of his fascination with the instrument . " We were poor , but my mother saved for a year and she finally got me a Sears and Roebuck Silvertone guitar , " he says , with his voice still ringing of a little boy 's pride and joy . From the jump , Francis knew he was hooked . After all , it was his guitar and country music ( " I grew up on it and gospel . " ) that allowed him momentary escape from the poverty , monotony and hopelessness of his segregated rural southern hometown . " I would dream about far away places and I dreamed I would be successful , " says Francis , whose earliest ambition was to be a singer/guitarist . Even during his undergraduate and graduate years in college , he managed to balance his medical studies with his love of country music . " I performed in little roadside cares , honky tonks and bars until I graduated ( from Southern University ) and went to medical school , " says Francis , who received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of William and Mary prior to receiving his medical degree from the Medical College of Virginia . " And during my summers in medical school , when everyone else was working in hospitals , I took off and was playing Holiday Inns , and dinner-and-supper clubs . " Now at 46 , he 's got what he wants : a successful cardiology practice just outside the nation 's capital and the freedom to choose between his medicine and his music . For the first time , he 's on the brink of having it all . Everything he has ever wanted . " I feel like I 'm just living out a childhood dream , " he says , obviously pleased by the vast prospects . But , naturally , with the dream comes the anxieties . " It is a frightening thought . Here I always dreamed about something like this all my life and now it could happen , " confides Francis , semi-relaxing in his office suite a few weeks before the album 's release . " And I want it to happen . But ... " Awaiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record label is n't easy . However , in spite of the " buts " , there is no doubt at all that these are the best of times for the Cajun country native whose single Love Light peaked on the country top 40 chart . In fact , it was the video for Love Light , which Francis bankrolled himself after the record label he was with at the time offered him little or no assistance with the project , that brought him to the attention of Liberty Records President Jimmy Bowen . Quite impressed with the video after catching it on Country Music Television , Bowen signed Francis , and even served as co-producer on his album Tourist In Paradise . " I honestly believe this album is going to do well . The music is designed to invite everybody into it regardless of race , age , religion , or creed . It 's an album about life , " says Francis , explaining that he listened to more than 1,000 songs before selecting the 10  --  including Love Light  --  that are on his debut release . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ songs most people connect with country music , Francis , a divorcee , says his music is not devised " to rob people of their dignity . " " It 's mostly up-tempo  --  no tears-in-my-beer , leave-me-and-I 'll jump-off-a-bridge songs . I want my music to be therapeutic as well as entertaining . " For better or worse , his music is not just lyrics and harmony , it 's who he is . " I 've been laughed at about this music . " he confides matter-of-factly . " People would say , " why do n't you do R &B; and Pop ? " Some good friends of mine are telling me I should be doing stuff that 's more commercial and popular . But I said I 'm sticking to this kind of music . " Why ? " I do n't see myself going into country music as a Black man singing country music , " he explains , obviously hopeful this will be the last time he 'll have to justify himself . " I see myself as an entertainer with a song in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country music . I 'm serious about singing and making no apologies . " And , fortunately , no one 's asking him to . <p>
