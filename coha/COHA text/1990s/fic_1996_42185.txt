IN THE SUMMER OF 1880 , he came . He came like all visions do , humping up out of the depths of sleep , breaking surfy spumes of dreams , his flukes slapping hard on the water , slapping me awake . My leviathan . I knew him instantly , the way one recognizes a pickpocket who , familiar with your purse , smiles as he jostles you and disappears into the thick . I had had this dream before , perhaps many times , but never before had I ridden its back waking into the wan morning light . <p> Once I had seen him , I could not sleep . Once I had seen him , I was consumed . Like Jonah , I knew him from the inside out , his ribbing , the oil smell of him , his internal darkness like the world before the first day . The baleen , clamped tight on me . Even when my eyes were closed , <p> saw him . <p> Now I had a waking dream . I waged a campaign of letters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I persisted . <p> believed in my Blue Whale . In my life I had been many men , a realty broker , an auctioneer , a man of the law , an insurance agent , but all these dispersed when I envisioned what I could be , who I would be , a man as big as this country , as big as this dream whale . I had been called , and nothing would deter me from my vocation . I wrote letters , and I prayed for a response . <p> Captain Phillip Cook answered my prayer with a telegram . He had found my whale and towed him into Provincetown , sixty feet of him and forty tons . With $450 we sealed the deal . Cook arranged for the evisceration , four tons of entrails according to my notes . We would raise my whale at the Fort Hill dry dock on December 18 . <p> The night before the raising , the riggers framed the cradle . As they sunk the dock and drained it , their rough talk turned into a spray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ice that skittered brittle shatters as they struck the wharves . The torches and lamps flickered , darting shadows like brit breaking into the frigid night . The men 's hands wrestled with icy lines ; their backs strained . <p> By midnight , the stroke when souls make contracts , the whale floated in the railroad dock . The derricks ' iron skeletons loomed over him in a silence so fixed it was as if sound itself had frozen . I had made my contract . I spent a sleepless night . <p> The morning offered no relief . The sea-raw cold gnawed the thousands of spectators who came to witness the raising , but I knew by their numbers that my dream was not misguided . The Inland Whaling Cruise would be a success . Fred Englehardt proved a good purchase at one thousand dollars and the five hundred advance . Fliers , banners , headlines : THE CETACEAN NON PAREIL . THE MONARCH OF THE SEAS . THE PRINCE OF WHALES . Englehardt was a gifted promoter , and he was as good as his word ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Bernhardt to accompany him to the exhibition . But in my mind , the whale eclipsed them both . <p> At nine that morning , with the commencement of the raising , <p> forgot even Englehardt , he who would become my partner . All my heart , my attention , rose with the whale . His ascent took two hours , but the time snapped whiplike by me . At last he rested . He was magnificent , larger than my imagination . My eyes could not take him in . Frozen , prone on the flatcars , he extended the length of ten tall men , of two rail cars . Around me people murmured . I barely registered their awe , so intent was I on my own . Transfixed , I approached , but he stopped me short . Something , some emotion stared at me from his gelid eye , some knowledge of depths I would never know , something sparkling like bream , something suspended there but as elusive to me as plankton . A knowledge of coral forests , the seductive dance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A knowledge of me . I saw myself in the convex mirror of his eye and startled , realizing a second later that the man beside me , holding my elbow , was addressing me . " Only a theory , mind you , cryogenics . Fairly new . But low temperatures may preserve life in a state of suspended animation . Imagine . " He drew on his pipe . <p> " His vital organs have been removed , " I said , and turned away in the mirror of the whale 's eye , but not without a shiver . Had I been reproved ? <p> The opening exhibition a success , Englehardt arranged for the next . We were heading west . Imagining my fortunes in that cold carcass that was clacking over the rails to Chicago , I felt younger than my forty-nine years and as old as the pioneering spirit that made men nudge their dreams ahead of them , nudge them into actuality . Evincing again his entrepreneurial acumen , Englehardt arranged that special track be laid to accommodate fittingly our prince in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to pay homage at : twenty-five cents an adult head , fifteen cents a child . Giddy with our clinking coffers , day after day , I mounted the whale . If he was prince , then I was king . Standing high above the heads of the spectators , I saw with the whale 's eye these diminutive people . With him as my dais , I lectured from nine until ten o'clock , indicating for the curious the paired blowholes , the rorqual 's furrowed throat . Nothing in my jack-of-all-trades past had prepared me for this , the fascination of the crowd , their awestruck attention , their eyes on me as I , Uncle George Newton , guided their landlocked imaginations into the mystery of this alien , a mammal like themselves , but one who knew cold and watery secrets . I confess , I inflated with pride . How could I not ? Even Jonah knew only the inside of his whale . I surmounted mine , knew him every inch . Master of it , I stood outside my dream . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sold tickets passionately . Only at night , retired to Burdick House , could I calm myself , writing letters to my son , Warren , trying to convey my achievement , the money filling the till , the dreams I had of fortunes as immense as the whale . Three hundred , four hundred , six hundred dollars a day . And still the people came , thousands of them , 4,302 alone on one of January 's bitterest days . What drove them to come ? An unfathomable curiosity . Englehardt , more cynical than I , quoted the Great One : " There 's a sucker born every minute . " But <p> recall the silence as they shuffled around the whale , the hands extended , the timid fingers uncurling , gloved against the cold , longing to touch the flesh , longing to comprehend this ice-monster in his glorious entirety . The hush was the hush of contemplation , the contemplation of the other . And I was its high priest . <p> I extended grace to the poor , whom I admitted free , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I saw myself as priest and professor and a businessman with a daily gross of $250 . At the end of January , we prepared to leave Chicago for Milwaukee , where Englehardt had been busy publicizing the show and arranging for our reception , setting up the pavilion . <p> There even the snow could not deter us from breaking our records . 5,878 visitors on February 2 . The money jingled in . From Milwaukee to St. Louis , from St. Louis to Columbus  --  where the only impediment was the observation of the Sabbath  --  from pious Columbus to Pittsburgh . <p> The whale was holding up , but the men were growing weary . Their tempers showed it . Captain McCarthy was blurting short answers at visitors . There were complaints . Firmly and clearly , I demanded respect for the whale and for the paying congregations . Anything less and he would be discharged from my employ . He grumbled , but men live close to their pockets . <p> At the end of March we rolled into Philadelphia , which proved less lucrative than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no end in sight . <p> But on my podium in Cleveland , despite good attendance , I caught a whiff of misfortune . The whale was beginning to rot . Not one disposed to idling when action can alter fortune , I directed that the prince be embalmed . I was determined to keep the whale alive . Eight barrels of his bowels and twelve hours of fumigation reassured me that the procedure was a success . For cosmetic reasons , I ordered that the whale be painted every night . Also for cosmetic reasons , I no longer elected to use the prince as my platform . <p> In Toledo the doltish farmers milled , dumb to the profound mystery before them . In Detroit we religiously painted him every night , and by showtime he was firm , restored to magnificence . But I worried . I worried . The embalming took time . I deluded myself that it was working , that we were staving off decay . <p> The daily tribune in Bay City convinced me that we needed expertise . " Phew " the article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mummery , a taxidermist with excellent credentials . His name alone should have forewarned me ; it proved prophetic . <p> But I embraced faith . I wanted to believe that Mummery was a magician of the flesh . For six weeks the venture stalled near Saginaw Bay . Englehardt kept me apprised by post . In my solitude , I thought of the poet who wrote , " Day after day , day after day , /We stuck , nor breath nor motion . " The sixteen of them , Mummery , Englehardt , and fourteen hirelings , worked to resurrect the corpse in the railroad siding of " Camp Baliene , " complaining about the locals , the mosquitoes , the snakes , and the blackmailer slut Mrs. Fowler , who kept threatening eviction . The cost was formidable , and so , according to Englehardt , was the task : its stench , the dreadful decomposing flesh . " Nor breath , nor motion . " The whale 's restoration devoured money . The more flesh they restored , the more decay they encountered . So much rot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ate our proceeds ; he seemed insatiable . But the whale was dead . <p> I began to mistrust the employees . Perhaps they misrepresented the whale 's state . Perhaps they were lazing about , enjoying a rustic vacation . Perhaps they exaggerated the prince 's deterioration and were pocketing the flume of money that flowed from the company coffers . Perhaps . Too much perhaps . I felt helpless and gave myself over to misdoubts and troubling dreams . <p> The whale bellied into my nights . As he thawed and softened , as he became flesh , water trickled from his blowholes like blood from wounds . Finally , fully alive , he flapped his flukes , the slap startling me into a half-waking state in which I saw him wink and speak with his eye , " We 're halfway home , Newton . " A somnambulist , I rose from these dreams and numbly paced off my attacks of nerves . And as I paced , I prayed . I prayed to the whale with a fevered repetitiveness , " Heal yourself . Heal yourself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my misgivings like so much dandelion spore . The professor pronounced him cured . Englehardt wrote that the whale was no longer " perishable flesh " but a " hard , stony mass . " My heart and ambitions renewed at the prospect , I contemplated a tour of Europe . I could foresee princes humbled before my prince , queens lowering their heads . <p> History aborted my scheme . On July 2 an angry appointment-seeker with disappointed dreams shot Mr. Garfield . For two months the president rested in suspended animation , and the country lingered in a coma of uncertainty and grief . In September he finally died ; one tiny man 's thwarted ambition had , once again , sunk a bullet into our American heart . What kind of president might Garfield have become ? <p> Attendance fell off . We dragged our tour to Ohio , Indiana , Illinois . I grew fatigued , dragging my carcass around , an analogue for the dead weight of the whale 's . So heavy the burden , so impossible the task , I felt as if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like Jonah , " Out of the belly of hell cried I , " but no one listened . My trials dropped like mute stones into water . We ground on . <p> Englehardt 's " Monster Whale " gave monstrous offense everywhere . Baking in the sun , shriveling into death , he emitted the rankness of his putrefying flesh for blocks . Only a visitor with no olfactory sense at all could approach him . We were degenerating into sideshow freaks . I struggled to redeem the show . Chicago had been a blessed place for us . We would head west again , to the frontier of our hope . We returned to Chicago and sank to our necks in the muck of debt . The putrescence , like some omnipresent devil , hovered everywhere . It wove its malodor into my clothes , poisoned my food , slept beside me in my bed . My despondent skin itself exhaled its perfume . Even my dreams stank . I suffocated beneath the blubbery , foul-gutted cadaver and surfaced , gasping for air . " The very deep did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my hands of my carrion dream , <p> left Englehardt to drag the abomination around to towns where no one wanted to see him . They should have come . They should have come in droves . They missed a magnificent lesson that all the paint in the world , all the rubbery patches would not disguise . Dreams rot from within . <p> Englehardt wrote me from New Orleans , the continental edge of the civilized world , that we might still sell the venture . I ignored him . He returned to Chicago , leaving the whale in the management of our crew . <p> Barnum , that god of flimflam flummery , scam , and sham who once I thought might save me , was stomping around the country now with his living colossus , Jumbo . The shills were lining up , their Coney coins hot in their hands , while Englehardt witnessed with his correspondence our whale 's degeneration into hunks of meat and rubber patches . <p> Jumbo stomped out of Poughkeepsie just three days before our flyblown , gassy pulp rolled in . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew things the Great One did not . I knew even his golden Jumbo was an oversized dream lumbering in , trampling over the old one . Jumbo , too , would drop to his knees when the next locomotive dream came roaring in . And Barnum was only a road show , a prop in a top hat . Nowhere are there false gods or true . <p> In Poughkeepsie a brawl broke out in the tent . Our hirelings threatened mutiny . But we were bankrupt . There was nothing left to patch together . Englehardt was a scoundrel , and I , I was a failure . I had no energy left . I was a gas balloon without the gas . <p> In September the whole rotted enterprise sold at auction in Poughkeepsie , fetching two thousand dollars . The Poughkeepsie Daily Eagle named the buyer , one J. Homer Hildreth of Chicago ; Chicago , which had witnessed both our ascent and our demise . I have no knowledge of the whale 's whereabouts or disposal . He is lost , like the memory of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> But damn him , he still breaks my dreams , leaves me thrashing and treading in their wake . I harpoon him with the furious strength of all my wasted energy , hopes for fame , for prosperity , for travel , hopes that I might yet prove a greater man than I have assessed myself to be . And I loved that whale . I loved him so much that when he surfaces in my nightmares , I stab the toe of my blacked boot into his rubbery hide . Maggots squirm from the hole I gore there , and this fetid wisdom effuses : We are all swallowed up . We drop like forgotten carcasses back into an immense sea where we bloat , leucous and flabby , and rock in a cradle of decay . While the hucksters scream , the carnies play their shell games , and the hawkers hand out flybills with frenetic futility , the whole of us , from birth , goes on and on , putrefying from within with this primitive knowledge  --  memorize it : we are meat . <p>  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
