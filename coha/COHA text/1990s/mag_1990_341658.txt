As wondrous as it seemed at the time , the unanimity achieved by the world community three weeks ago in condemning Iraq 's invasion of Kuwait was the easy part . The real test is hanging together to defeat Saddam Hussein . <P> In the first weeks of United Nations-sponsored sanctions , there was heartening evidence of a determined international effort to make the penalties stick . The exceptions proved the rule : Sri Lanka continued to sell tea  --  1.1 million lbs . of it each week  --  to Iraq , arguing that its frail economy could not afford to lose the export income . Bulgaria asked the U.N . for an exemption , also pleading poverty . Most other nations appeared ready to hold to the embargo , at least for a while : even Switzerland broke a centuries-long tradition of neutrality to join in the effort . <P> On the military front , there was less cohesion . Initially , the Bush Administration 's dash to bolster Saudi Arabia 's defenses produced a groundswell of support . The British contributed warplanes and ships to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nations began to converge on the Arabian Peninsula . But as the U.S. military buildup continued , there was a palpable sense of hesitancy in many world capitals . Asked whether non- American and non-British vessels would actually fight against Iraq , a senior British diplomat replied , " Let 's hope the issue never arises . The fragile unity could simply fall apart . " <P> The single greatest source of concern was the U.S. move to enforce a blockade of Iraq without a go-ahead from the U.N . Security Council .

The truth is that each nation involved in the gulf crisis has a unique set of interests , and some augur for more tenacity than others . <P> BRITAIN . Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has never been one to flinch from a challenge , and her country has a deep historical interest in the Middle East . Thatcher has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Moreover , she is always keen on reinforcing the " special relationship " between London and Washington that was believed to be on the wane with the advent of the Bush Administration . Popular opinion strongly supports Thatcher 's tough stand : a recent Gallup poll showed that 83% of Britons approve of her actions in sending forces to the gulf  --  more than backed her in the 1982 Falklands war . <P> FRANCE . Although the government of President Francois Mitterrand has dispatched six ships to the trouble zone , it has assiduously distanced itself from the U.S. military effort . Asked why no French troops are on the ground in Saudi Arabia , Foreign Minister Roland Dumas declared , " Our help has not been solicited . " A more likely explanation is that France , as ever , is averse to overt military cooperation with the U.S.
