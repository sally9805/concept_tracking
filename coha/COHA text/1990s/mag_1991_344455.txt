If communism as we have known and hated it is out of the way , perhaps George Bush can now talk unabashedly to Soviet officials about such good old- fashioned values as God , truth and the sanctity of human life . Evangelist Billy Graham , who talked to Boris Yeltsin and Mikhail Gorbachev shortly before the botched coup , returned from the Soviet Union and passed the word to his friend Bush that both men had told him of the need for " some philosophy , some religion , an inner strength " for their society . <P> How dramatic a change that is in the nature of Big Power relationships is now up for discussion by the President and his men . On the waters of Kennebunkport , Bush and his National Security Adviser , Brent Scowcroft , ponder " the new rationality , " where facts will not be obliterated by rigid ideology . White House planners are anticipating a reemergence of Christianity in Russia , bringing with it a moral framework that has long been absent from Soviet political life . <P> For much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the " unnatural " concepts of communism was often more difficult than confronting Soviet military power , which was measurable and matchable . Harry Truman , like most American pols , believed he could touch the soul of any man he sat down with after a couple of toddies . He came back from the Potsdam Conference in 1945 enamored of the new friend he called " Old Joe " Stalin . Then the cold war started , and Truman got a clear view of the dark heart of a fanatic communist . <P> After the Bay of Pigs , and with tension rising in Berlin , John Kennedy went to Vienna believing that he could find some agreement with Nikita Khrushchev on how to reduce the threat of nuclear war . Instead he drew blank stares and threats . Throughout that grim summer Kennedy would talk to friends about Khrushchev 's seeming indifference to the specter of millions of people dying in a nuclear exchange . " I 'd never encountered anybody like that before , " Kennedy mused . <P> Lyndon Johnson , the master persuader , thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Glassboro summit in 1967 and slow arms sales to the troubled Middle East . Kosygin joined heartily in swapping stories about going hungry and chopping wood as boys . But the cold curtain came down when they got around to discussing a deal to ease tension . L.B.J. emerged from that meeting , his long face sagging , and told his National Security Adviser , Walt Rostow , " I 've used everything I know , but I think I 've failed . " <P> Richard Nixon probably understood the nature of communism best , perhaps because of his conspiratorial bent and his take-no-prisoners approach to U.S. politics . Ronald Reagan was the most candid when he branded the system " the evil empire . " <P> White House Soviet experts say the " amorality of communism " continued to bedevil Presidents up until Gorbachev took power . The first hint of change came when British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in 1984 signaled to Reagan that Gorbachev seemed realistic and trustworthy . If whatever Soviet entity survives this upheaval embraces the human values of democracy , it will , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " make it easier emotionally and conceptually for us , but it wo n't be any easier in terms of the number of problems . " That 's gain enough .
