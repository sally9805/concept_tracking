For a second week , Israel continued its artillery and air attacks on villages controlled by Shi'ite Hizballah guerrillas in southern Lebanon . So far , 24 people have been killed and 59 wounded . Fighting began after guerrillas attacked Israel 's " security zone " inside the Lebanese border . Arab assailants meanwhile stabbed two Israelis to death , a 15-year-old schoolgirl near Tel Aviv and a rabbi in the Gaza Strip . Both murders sparked anti-Arab riots by Israelis . Defense Minister Moshe Arens ordered the Strip sealed off , restricting 700,000 Palestinians to the area .
