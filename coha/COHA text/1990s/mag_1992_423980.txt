Through boom times and grim times , New Yorkers get on with their lives in a town whose high , iron temper confers something of the heroic on the least of its residents <p> We used to have rubber-band fights sometimes . A Saturday-afternoon visit to his office was one of my favorite treats . Irving Browning 's office was like no one else 's . He was the founder and owner of Camera Mart , a motion-picture-equipment rental and supply company But there was little in his office about cinematography , unless it was the row of antique movie cameras that lined a high shelf running around the walls . No , Irving 's office was , rather , an eclectic museum . Prominent on the wall to the left as you entered was an original Mutoscope , Charlie Chaplin flickering forever in its interior darkness . Stacked against it was an ever-changing assortment of antique weaponry from almost any historical epoch you could name , but especially from the American past . Remington bronzes loomed out of the semidarkness ( there never seemed to be lights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Hanging on the wall behind his desk among a number of prints was a framed arrow labeled , " The Arrow That Killed Custer . " Even then I do n't think I believed it . <p> Irving was n't a well-educated man , I am told , but he certainly was fascinated by history , all history , and was never too busy to talk about it to a ten-year-old boy . Even better , nothing in his office was untouchable , and nothing gave him more pleasure than sharing his collection with others . <p> Irving died in 1961 , and my father and his partners took over Camera Mart . <p> It was n't until nearly thirty years later that I learned about Irving Browning , the photographer . A small 1989 exhibit of his photographs at the New-York Historical Society took me completely by surprise . The quality and variety of his work were astonishing . Even more astonishing was the information from my father when , following the exhibit , I started to question him about Irving 's career as a photographer , many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in storage at Camera Mart . <p> On a March day I trundled home with eight cartons of collapsing cardboard , shrouded in three decades of dust . Inside , in a state of terrible neglect and deterioration , were some thirty-five cases of material . Prints and negatives tumbled out literally by the thousands , an unparalleled photographic history of a vanished New York . <p> Taken between 1918 and 1938 , Irving 's photographs captured a city even then gargantuan , but somehow less intimidating . It was a city of proportion and scale , built and occupied by people not yet too small for their surroundings . <p> Irving seemed to have been everywhere and interested in everything . Down in gaping excavations where men with jackhammers were carving out the foundations for a future Rockefeller Center . Precariously perched on the cables of a George Washington Bridge whose roadway hangs truncated in empty space , stretching toward the Palisades . Up in the girders of an unfinished Empire State Building , the very emblem of the city it would soon crown . He documented the construction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and caps , with wooden toolboxes and pencil stubs stuck behind their ears , men who built a city wielding hammers and trowels , with never a printout or a calculator to be seen . <p> Irving 's New York is filled with people nonchalantly aware of their responsibility to the city in which they lived . Businessman , window shopper , street peddler , they all move well dressed and dignified across a cityscape punctuated with dirigibles and double-decker buses . Sunlight slants down to Sixth Avenue through the slats of the El 's tracks , and even the shantytown inhabitants of the Depression-era Hoovervilles wear suits and hats . <p> It is a city that seems to bristle with humanity and optimism . I find myself liking the nameless minions who populate those streets . You have the feeling that they would never litter , or play the radio too loud . On the streets of Irving 's New York , people pay five cents for a glimpse through a telescope of the " world 's tallest building , " wrangle piles of skyscraper steel with heavy cables and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their shoes shined by bootblacks , and line up in droves for the premieres of " alltalking " motion pictures . They ride the " Iron Steamer " out to Coney Island in the summer while harpists and violinists play on deck . Musicians in dinner jackets broadcast live big-band music from under striped awnings on the roof of the Municipal Building . It is a city in which blurred ghosts flit across the December sidewalks of Times Square on a snowy night , and several inches of snow accumulate without a tire track . <p> Irving was fascinated from the beginning with cinematography . Over the years the packets of motion-picture negative clips in his archives became increasingly numerous . It is clear that he carried his moving and still cameras simultaneously . Some of his films still exist , and the compositions are identical . By the late thirties he seems to have abandoned stills entirely for moving images . It was a loss to New York ; it would have been wonderful to share the exuberant postwar years with him as seen through his remarkable camera . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the late fifties . I think he would be pleased to know that he , too , has found a place of his own in that heritage and in the history of the city he obviously loved so well . <p> PHOTO : Cruise-line passengers watch the skyline slip by , September 1933 . <p> PHOTO : Looking up Fifth Avenue at Forty-sixth Street , April 1926 . <p> PHOTO : A rainy afternoon in Herald Square . <p> PHOTO : Passing by Orringer 's stove windows , on Broadway . <p> PHOTO : A mechanic tinkers with his car beneath a panoramic billboard . <p> PHOTO : A magazine stand outside Grand Central Terminal , November 1932 . <p> PHOTO : Joe E.
