<p> Mid-season firings out of style lately <p> Los Angeles - Not since Rick Venturi took over for Ron Meyer at Indianapolis after five games of the 1991 campaign has an NFL coach been replaced during the season . Though at least seven coaches are definitely on the endangered species list - Wayne Fontes ( Detroit ) , Chuck Knox ( L.A. Rams ) , Jim Mora ( New Orleans ) , Jack Pardee ( Houston ) , Wade Phillips ( Denver ) , David Shula ( Cincinnati ) and Sam Wyche ( Tampa Bay ) - the trend might continue this year , said a man who has experienced first-hand the travails of inheriting a ship that 's already taking on water . <p> " Unless an owner makes it clear that you 're not some short-timer who 's just coming in to play out the string , like Al Davis did here with me , it does n't make sense , " said Los Angeles Raiders coach Art Shell . " It 's not good for the team , the organization , the interim coach . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in recent years to succeed . He replaced Mike Shanahan four games into the ' 89 season with the Raiders at 1-3 , and guided the club to a 7-5 record the rest of the year . " But I had to get their respect from day one , and I was able to do that , " said Shell . " That 's not usually the case once things start deteriorating . " <p> Since 1985 , there have been 14 in-season coaching changes in the NFL . Besides Shell , only two other fill-ins - Meyer ( 3-0 with the Colts in 1986 ) and Fred Bruney ( 1-0 after taking over for Marion Campbell at Philadelphia in ' 85 ) - were able to fashion winning marks . <p> Six of the interim coaches - Bruney , Jim Hanifan ( Atlanta , 1989 ) , Hank Kuhlman ( Arizona , 1989 ) , Phillips ( New Orleans , 1985 ) , Jim Shofner ( Cleveland , 1990 ) and Venturi - were n't retained as head coach the following season by their respective teams . The cumulative record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 24-60 , a winning percentage of .286 . <p> " I 've been one of the lucky ones , " said Buffalo coach Marv Levy , who most people forget replaced Hank Bullough 10 games into 1986 . " For most , it 's pretty much a thankless job , you know ? " <p> TRAINING GROUNDS : Has anybody noticed that Bobby Ross ( San Diego ) , Barry Switzer ( Dallas ) and Dennis Green ( Minnesota ) - three coaches who came to the NFL straight from the college ranks - all have their teams in first place and have an aggregate record of 16-3 ? In this era of free agency , owners and general managers are going to be increasingly seeking out coaching candidates who can deal with big-time annual turnover , yet still retain some consistency . <p> That likely means more candidates from the college ranks , where everybody operates on a four-or five-year cycle . The college guys high on NFL lists : Steve Spurrier ( Florida ) , Dennis Erickson ( Miami ) , Barry Alvarez ( Wisconsin ) , Bill Snyder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> SAINTHOOD : According to Atlanta-based agent Pat Dye Jr. , former Falcons first-rounder Tony Smith , waived last month , will sign with the Saints on Monday . Smith is likely to fit much better into New Orleans ' I- formation attack . With the Saints ranked dead last in rushing offense and current tailbacks Derek Brown , Vaughn Dunbar and Mario Bates all either ineffective or injured , Smith may get a chance to do more than simply run back punts and kickoffs . <p> CREDIT DUE : He 's been all but buried in the kudos being extended to tailback Natrone Means , quarterback Stan Humphries , linebacker Junior Seau , Ross and general manager Bobby Beathard . But credit first-year secondary coach Willie Shaw for playing a big part in San Diego 's 6-0 start . After nine seasons in Detroit and Minnesota , Shaw came to the Chargers and dramatically simplified the pass-coverage schemes implemented by his predecessor , John Fox . Just as important , he bucked up the sagging confidence of second-year cornerback Darrien Gordon , the Chargers ' first-round pick in 1993 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in pass defense a year ago , are up to No. 14 . The secondary has allowed opponents a paltry 5.3 yards per pass play , the third-best mark in the league . And better coverage has translated into a better pass rush as well . Unofficially , eight of San Diego 's 20 quarterack kills can be categorized as " coverage sacks . " <p> NO-ATTACK PACK : Green Bay Packers coach Mike Holmgren continues to be frustrated by quarterback Brett Favre 's lack of consistency , and the uncharacteristic lack of production from wideout Sterling Sharpe , who already has eight dropped passes this year . While general manager Ron Wolf has done a great job in Green Bay , the decision to go with a couple of kids , Mark Brunnell and Ty Detmer , as the backup quarterbacks could prove disastrous . <p> And how 's this for first-possession futility ? In their last 14 games , the Packers have failed to score on their first possession . In the last 13 games , they 've registered just two first downs on opening drives . <p> THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ol ' curmudgeon/coach Buddy Ryan has his Arizona Cardinals ready ( so he says ) for their second encounter in three weeks with the Super Bowl champion Cowboys . But not even a 38-3 whipping at Texas Stadium on Oct. 9 can convince Buddy-boy that his 2-4 outfit is n't quite the juggernaut he made it out to be in preseason . <p> Ryan spent much of last week boasting that his defense was superior to Dallas ' unit , which coordinator Butch Davis has playing well enough to be ranked No. 1 in the league , both overall and against the pass . <p> " I do n't think there 's any question the Cardinals defense is better , Ryan said . " Our personnel is better . Our front seven is the best in football . " <p> Next thing you know , Buddy will be claiming that washed-up defensive end Clyde Simmons was worth the five-year , $ 14.5 million contract he gave him . <p> AROUND THE LEAGUE : How bad are things in Cincinnati , where the Bengals have scored one touchdown in the last 12 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not tired of football . I 'm just tired of the way this team plays it . " . . . Kansas City president Carl Peterson reiterated last week that he is not a candidate to become general manager in Philadelphia , and this time he actually sounded sincere . . . . Detroit linebacker Tracy Scroggins was on the field for barely 10 percent of the defensive plays in the first six games this year though his 15 1/2 sacks the last two years led the team . He finally has been promoted to the starting lineup , ahead of the unproductive Pat Swilling . . . . There reportedly were some pretty good haymakers landed last week when Vikings teammates Adrian Cooper and John Randle tangled . Cooper , a tight end , would n't vacate a trainer 's table for star defensive tackle Henry Thomas . In a case of defensive buddies sticking up for each other , Randle tossed Cooper , igniting the brawl . . . . To those folks wondering how the Redskins could promote seventh-rounder Gus Frerotte to starter , bumping Heath Shuler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so long ? Everyone we 've talked to claims Frerotte has thrown the ball better than Shuler since training camp , and that he comprehends Norv Turner 's offense much better , too . . . . So , wow , who-da thunk Georgia offensive coordinator Wayne " Wild Man " McDuffie , who once spit in the face of a reporter , could have gotten into a shouting match with Dogs offensive guard Steve Roberts ? . . . For the first time in his career , Dan Marino ha <p> STAT OF THE WEEK : So , you wonder why Houston 's Pardee is one of the coaches on the chopping block ? And why owner Bud Adams wants to take the play-calling away from assistant head coach Kevin Gilbride and turn it over to offensive coordinator Dick Coury ? Well , wonder no longer . The Oilers , amazingly , have scored just three touchdowns in the first three quarters this season . They 've been outscored 111-30 in the first three periods .
