Average water demand in southern California 's Metropolitan Water District exceeds locally available supplies by 2.5 million acre-feet. 1 Local rivers , groundwater , and reclaimed wastewater are capable of satisfying only one-third of the area 's demands of almost 4.0 million acre-feet per year . The balance is supplied by importing water from northern California and the Colorado River . Thus , of the 200 gallons of water used daily per capita in southern California , 125 gallons are imported from outside regions . Moreover , by 2010 , the average annual water demand is expected to surpass the combined local and imported supply by more than 1.5 million acre-feet , which would cause a supply shortfall of more than 30 percent . Rather than seek untapped water supplies , water planners in southern California are turning to water-demand management as a promising alternative . By 2010 , water conserved through increased efficiency of water use in southern California will constitute the largest single source of additional water . <p> The broadening of water planners ' perspectives to include demand-management alternatives and other innovative solutions has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planners must face today and in the future . Untapped sources of water are becoming rarer , and the depletion and contamination of goundwater sources has further limited supplies . Also , the increased frequency of droughts during the last decade has increased the competition for water between urban and agricultural interests . The environmental concerns about increased water use have intensified during the last two decades to the point where the development of new supplies is politically infeasible , and the prospects for financing major construction programs are discouraging for many water agencies . Finally , the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974 and its recent amendments have forced many communities to comply with increasingly stringent limits on a large number of contaminants in drinking water . These new limits have significantly increased the cost of water treatment , and some water sources that had served communities for decades are no longer considered adequate because of excessive contamination . <p> These new considerations have forced water planners to extend their perspective beyond traditional water resource development projects . Alternative ways of increasing water supply have been explored and evaluated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as pumped storage , reduction of losses through the lining of reservoirs , and evaporation suppression and reallocation of storage water for flood protection ; protection of existing supplies by cleaning up the waste sources contaminating water , construction of barriers against the intrusion of saltwater , and development of new technologies for large-scale treatment of contaminated aquifers ; development of unconventional sources of supply by using groundwater aquifers for storage of excess supply of surface water ( water banking ) or relying on conjunctive use of groundwater and surface water , desalinizing seawater or brackish groundwater to drinking-water quality , and reclaiming wastewater , for example , by building dual-pipe distribution systems ; and water marketing and regional management of the existing and new sources of supply to improve the distribution of water among water users within the region . <p> The use of demand-management alternatives represents an important change in water supply planning . Demand-reduction programs allow some agencies to balance future supply and demand at a cost that is below the economic , social , and environmental costs of new supply development . Efficient Water-Management Practices <p> Despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solution to water-supply problems , the engineering , economic , social , and environmental implications of demand-side programs are not fully understood . Some confusion is caused by the use of the term water conservation in the context of watersupply planning . The environmental community may look upon water conservation as a social good that involves general reductions in the use of water or the termination of certain uses of water . On the other hand , engineers may include under the term water conservation any sound and efficient water-supply planning and management practice , including the development of water storage reservoirs to " conserve " run-off . <p> To make water-demand management an integral part of water-resources planning , it is necessary to distinguish between supply- and demand-oriented strategies and to define the criteria for selecting alternatives that meet economic , social , and environmental feasibility requirements . Comprehensive water-supply management requires the evaluation of two basic sets of alternatives : those that reduce water use or loss and those that augment supplies . Taken together , these alternatives provide the basis for efficient water management . In balancing current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be to determine which combination of supply and demand alternatives is optimal from the social , environmental , and economic perspectives . The distinction between alternatives is most helpful in defining the economic criteria for selecting the best long-term water-management plan . Accordingly , various water-management practices can be conveniently separated into supply-augmentation or demand-reduction ( or conservation ) measures given a precise definition of water supply with respect to its geographic location and its position in the hydrologic cycle . <p> In general , water that is appropriated or physically segregated ( withdrawn or diverted ) from its source so that it is temporarily or permanently unavailable for other purposes or users is viewed as a given water supply . Depending on the level of water supply , demand management consists of reducing the use of water , reducing the loss or waste of water , and increasing the recycling of water so that supply is conserved or made partially available for future or alternate uses . The essence of demand management is the reduction of water use or loss . Thus , demand-management practices are those efforts that result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is less than the level of use that would have occurred at that time had the practices not been implemented . Not all practices that reduce water use should be considered desirable , however . The beneficial effects of a reduction in water use or loss must be considered greater than the adverse effects associated with the commitment of other resources to the demand-management effort . <p> Experience with water-demand management in southern California and other urban areas of the United States has allowed water planners to develop a process of a systematic analysis of demand-management alternatives. 2 This process consists of the following five analytical steps : analysis of water-use and service area data ; preparation of baseline water-use forecasts ; screening of demand-management practices ; analysis of the benefits and costs of demand-management programs ; and development of a long-term water-management plan . <p> If carefully executed , these five steps permit water-supply agencies to formulate viable demand-management alternatives and to decide on the optimal level of reduction in water demand for the long-term water-management plan . The Metropolitan Water District of southern California , for example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implementing urban water demand-management programs . Demand Management in Southern California <p> The Metropolitan Water District ( MWD ) was formed in 1928 to build the Colorado River Aqueduct to supplement local water supplies of its original 13 member cities . Today , the area served by MWD encompasses almost 5,200 square miles , including the southern California coastal plain . It extends about 200 miles along the coast of the Pacific Ocean from the city of Oxnard to the Mexican border on the south and reaches 70 miles inland from the coast ( see Figure 1 on this page ) . MWD now has 27 member agencies , including 14 cities , 12 municipal water districts , and 1 county water authority . The residents of more than 145 cities and 94 unincorporated communities are served by the 27 member agencies , and there are approximately 250 retail water-supply agencies directly serving the population of approximately 15 million. 3 <p> Total water use in the area in 1990 was estimated to be 3.7 million acre-feet . This demand is imposed by 5.1 million households , approximately 400,000 business establishments employing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cropland and orchards . Current agricultural water use amounts to about 380,000 acre-feet per year. 4 MWD supplies about 55 percent of the total regional demand . Figure 2 on page 10 shows the breakdown of the municipal and industrial demands among major urban sectors and seasonal uses . <p> Both a fast growing population and expanding economic activity have increased pressure on the existing local and imported sources of supply . Obtaining additional imported water is very difficult because of political and environmental concerns . In fact , even the availability of current sources will soon diminish because of litigation that reduces the diversion of water from the Mono Lake basin through the Los Angeles aqueducts . The on-going six-year drought in the state has highlighted the grim water-supply situation in southern California . <p> In the mid 1980s , MWD began to devote significant resources to the management of water demand . At first , the agency embarked on a series of studies to analyze the existing water demands in its service area , to prepare a 20-year forecast of water use , and to evaluate the effects of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of water-use and service-area data allowed MWD to understand better the factors that influence current water use . Water-use forecasts were prepared using the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers ' IWR-MAIN ( Institute for Water Resources-Municipal and Industrial Needs ) water-use forecasting model. 5 The forecast included estimates of water use for the planning period from 1990 to 2010 . Separate forecasts were developed for 51 urban clusters and for 6 less urbanized areas representing the balance of each of the 6 counties served by MWD . Each forecast was broken down into major urban sectors and categories of users in each sector to facilitate the evaluation of water-conservation alternatives . <p> To provide data on variables driving water use in the area , MWD turned to regional planning agencies with requests for reliable forecasts of population , housing , employment , and income in each of the 57 study areas . In addition , several econometric studies were undertaken to identify and measure the effects of price , income , weather , and other variables on water use. 6 The projected growth and water-use relationships in the area were incorporated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water demand . The results showed that , without demand management , the per-capita rate of water use would increase between 1990 and 2010 by 24.4 gallons per capita per day . Almost half of this increase would be caused by the projected decrease in the number of persons per household and the projected increase in the percentage of the population employed . The other half would result from the increasing real household income and differential growth rates throughout southern California , including the increasing rate of development in hot desert areas . The 24.4 gallons per capita per day represents a net increase because of these factors even after the effects of trends in housing , such as more multi-unit dwellings , and the expected shift in employment toward less water-intensive activities are taken into account . <p> A screening of potential demand-management alternatives revealed that the expected increases in per-capita demand will be partly offset by water savings resulting from the California Plumbing Code of 1980 , which required water-efficient plumbing such as 3.5-gallons-per-flush toilets , 1.5-gallons-per-flush urinals , and showerheads and faucets with a maximum flow rate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1980. 7 Additional reductions in demand have resulted from major increases in the real prices of water between 1980 and 1990 . By 2010 , the full impacts of the plumbing code and the price increases are expected to produce water savings of 12.2 and 8.6 gallons per capita per day , respectively . <p> MWD and other water institutions in southern California are often criticized for not raising the prices of water to a level where all wasteful uses of water in the area would be eliminated . Critics often overlook the fact that both publicly and privately owned water utilities are not free to increase prices to achieve reductions in water use . The existing laws and regulations allow water providers to recover their costs through water rates . Because as much as 80 percent of the cost of supplying water is often fixed in the form of debt on capital investments , the set prices are likely to be low when water use is high . Water providers are allowed to increase prices only after water use has declined , thus causing a revenue shortfall . For example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California ranged from $0.84 to $2.72 per 1,000 gallons. 8 The average household paid $1.55 per 1,000 gallons , which is roughly 20 percent more than the national average . Even with the projected large increases in future prices , the cost of water will likely amount to only about one percent of average household income . Therefore , the current and future prices of water are not likely to provide a strong incentive for water conservation . To achieve significant reductions in water use , pricing strategies must be accompanied by nonprice demand-management programs . MWD has established demand-reduction programs with some creative economic incentives to achieve its water management goals . Best Management Practices <p> A comparison of the results of the forecast of water use without demand-management with existing dependable water supplies reveals that , by 2010 , average annual water demand in the MWD service area will exceed the available supply by more than 1.5 million acre-feet ( see Figure 3 on this page ) . 9 Meeting this shortfall without reducing demand would be practically impossible . Additional supplies of imported water from the State Water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contingent upon significant reductions in future water demands . A draft water rights allocation plan issued in 1988 by the State Water Resources Control Board ( SWRCB ) called for water savings in MWD 's service area that were viewed as " unreasonable " by the water suppliers . In response to this plan , several urban water suppliers and the environmental community came together in 1988 to form the State Water Conservation Coalition , which developed an innovative approach to demand management . As part of the ongoing proceedings on the allocation of water rights in San Francisco Bay and the Sacramento San Joaquin Delta Estuary , the coalition , together with the Department of Water Resources and the SWRCB Urban Water Conservation Workgroup , came to a consensus on reasonable water-conservation measures and achievable water savings . These measures became known as the Urban Water Conservation Best Management Practices ( BMPs ) . On 12 December 1991 , the parties signed a memorandum of understanding that described the BMPs and set forth the obligations of the signatories. 10 The participating urban water agencies agreed to implement the BMPs aggressively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community that it would accept the projected water-savings estimates of the BMPs and support the development of more reliable water supplies . SWRCB will define water rights according to real needs and use water saved with BMPs to try to settle the dispute over water rights in the bay and delta estuary region . <p> Although no benefit-cost analyses were made during the proceedings to support the implementation of BMPS , the benefits of BMPs were considered to outweigh greatly their costs because the conserved water could be used for protecting streams , wetlands , and estuaries and for enhancing the reliability of urban water supply . Because the discussions among the parties involved were conducted in a spirit of cooperation , the environmental groups did not have to " twist arms " to get the urban suppliers to commit to conservation . The memorandum of understanding included some criteria for the use of benefit-cost analysis in selecting demand-reduction measures . For example , suppliers can be exempted from the implementation of individual BMPs if a full benefit-cost analysis performed in accordance with principles set forth in the memorandum demonstrates either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and costs are considered , such as from a societal perspective , or that the BMP is not cost-effective to the individual supplier even after the supplier has made an effort to share the costs with other program beneficiaries . BMP Implementation <p> Twenty BMPs will be implemented during the first 3 years of the initial 1O-year term of the agreement ( see the box on page 35 ) . Practices to be implemented during the first year include enforcement of water-conserving plumbing standards ( including requirements for ultra-low-flush toilets in all new construction that began after 1 January 1992 ) ; support of state and federal legislation prohibiting the sale of toilets using more than 1.6 gallons per flush ; audits of water-distribution systems ; public information campaigns ; school education programs ; prohibition of water waste ; and the appointment of a water-conservation coordinator . During the second year , the BMPs to be implemented include installing water-conserving plumbing in homes built before 1980 ; detecting and repairing leaks ; installing meters with commodity rates for all new and existing connections ; establishing landscape water-conservation requirements for new and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multi-family developments ; pricing all components to promote conservation ( except in billing for sewer service based on metered water use ) ; promoting landscape water conservation for new and existing single-family homes ; and replacing old toilets with ultra-low-flush toilets . During the third year , the remaining six practices to be implemented will include interior and exterior water audits and incentive programs for single-family residential , multi-family residential , governmental , and other institutional customers ; large landscape water-conservation audits and incentives ; commercial and industrial water-use reviews ; water-use reviews of new commercial and industrial developments ; conservation pricing in billing for sewer service based on metered water use ; and financial incentives to improve the efficiency of landscape water use and incentives from wholesale water suppliers to their customers . <p> MWD has assumed a very active role in implementing these practices in southern California . Table 1 on page 36 shows the estimates of water savings from existing conservation measures and from eight BMPS . The savings from BMPs not included in Table 1 have not yet been evaluated ; nevertheless , they will be implemented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establish a conservation branch and create an additional 22 professional and 5 clerical positions . The annual budget projection for this task is $21.3 million in the 1992-1993 fiscal year , increasing to $39.5 million by 1996. 11 If MWD 's expenses during this 5-year period constituted the implementation costs for all BMPS , then MWD would be able to save approximately 3.2 million acre-feet of water between 1990 and 2010 at a cost of $50 per acrefoot . Of course , the total costs will be higher because the member agencies and their subagencies will bear additional expenses . <p> In 1988 , MWD developed a system of financial incentives for encouraging water conservation called the Water Conservation Credits Program . Under this program , MWD currently pays member agencies and subagencies $154 per acre-foot of demonstrable water savings up to one-half of the cost of each qualifiable conservation project . The credits program is a primary vehicle for implementing water-conservation projects in MWD 's service area . The goal of the program is to save some 50,000 to 150,000 acre-feet of water per year. 12 <p> The final step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shortfall in future supplies by reducing the projected baseline demand in 2010 by 720,000 acre-feet , or 14.6 percent. 13 The rest of the shortfall will be met with supplies from local water reclamation projects ( 110,000 acre-feet per year ) , Colorado River supplies ( possibly 150,000 acre-feet per year obtained through negotiations with the Imperial Irrigation District ) , and State Water Project improvements and water transfers ( 560,000 acre-feet per year ) . Nevertheless , water conservation will constitute the largest single source of additional water by 2010 . Costs and Benefits <p> Analyzing the benefits and costs of demand-management programs allows planners and administrators to determine whether such programs can achieve " beneficial " reductions in water use . A benefit-cost analysis enables supply-augmentation alternatives , such as the construction of a new reservoir , to be compared with demand-reduction alternatives using the same economic criteria . Benefits of Reducing Demand <p> The benefits of demand-manage magnet measures arise from the reduction of water use and loss . Some of the benefits stem from the reduction of water-supply costs . To measure these types of benefits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planned future expansions in water supplies and facilities . Other benefits , such as energy savings , are indirectly related to reductions in water use and may be measured without knowledge of the water-supply plan . <p> Implementing demand-management measures may reduce the short-term incremental costs of water supply and wastewater disposal . These costs are associated with the last units of water to be produced or purchased in various years of the planning period , change immediately in response to changing use patterns , and are not associated with capital facilities . They include the costs of chemicals , energy , labor , and materials . The longterm incremental costs of water supply and wastewater disposal also may be reduced . These costs are associated with providing capital facilities for water supply and wastewater disposal , and they vary as the design capacities of the facilities vary because of changes in patterns and levels of water use . These foregone costs of new supply facilities may be a major benefit of a demand-management program . <p> Demand-reduction alternatives that decrease the use of heated water in the residential , commercial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some other possible advantageous economic effects include reduced costs to parties other than the water utility and the program participant . For example , if a demand-management measure reduces overall water use so that the groundwater table rises and the pumping costs for someone else drawing out of the same water source are reduced , the conservation measure has benefited a party other than the water utility and its customers . In many cases , water conservation has reduced extraction of groundwater and water from rivers and thereby increased the amount of water available for environmental purposes . Increased environmental supplies can have significant benefits for fish , wildlife , and water quality . Costs of Demand-Side Programs <p> Each demand-management alternative is associated with a proposed implementation plan . The implementation plan indicates the agency or agencies responsible for implementation of the conservation program , the time of implementation , the scope ( or coverage ) of the program , and the specific actions that must be taken to implement and maintain the program . These details may be used by planners and program administrators to estimate implementation costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those required to maintain the program 's full effectiveness in the future . Implementation costs may also be estimated separately , according to the type of organization to which they accrue . Costs borne by a water utility , for example , may be calculated separately from those borne by water users , by public-interest groups , and by public agencies other than the utility . <p> Each potential demand-management alternative should be reviewed to determine whether any costs to environmental quality are likely to occur . For example , if sprinkling restrictions kill lawns and damage shrubbery , such consequences may be considered a cost to the community as a whole as well as a cost to the property owner . Accounting Perspectives <p> Demand-management programs affect several different groups , including participants in the program , nonparticipating customers who pay water rates , water utility companies , and society as a whole . All are affected in different ways by each demand-reduction measure . A condition resulting from a demand-reduction measure can not simply be classified as a cost or benefit because it may impose a cost on one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempted to standardize the various perspectives , and these standards are being adopted by some water utilities. 14 According to these standards , the economic outcomes of conservation are assessed from five different perspectives , including those of the program participant , the ratepayer , society , the utility cost , and the total resource cost . <p> The participant 's perspective considers the costs and benefits to customers who participate in the conservation program . It provides information about the desirability of a specific alternative to customers and is especially useful for voluntary programs as an indicator of how willing people are to participate . This perspective also can be used for determining the minimum dollar value of rebate that would induce customers to participate in the program . The ratepayer 's perspective measures the effects that changes in the water-utility 's revenues and operating costs have on its customers ' water rates . Demand-management measures that reduce water use should also result in reduced operating costs and reduced revenues . This perspective considers the direction and magnitude of the expected change in customer water rates and bills and reflects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many demand-reduction programs , the revenues that the utility loses must be recaptured by charging customers higher rates . Therefore , a major concern to utilities implementing such programs is that they will sell less water and earn less revenue . Although this is true , the revenue shortfall can be predicted and water rates can be increased accordingly . Very few fully implemented programs provide water savings in excess of 10 to 15 percent of average water sales. 15 The revenue decrease will be partly mitigated by the utility 's benefits stemming from the reduced variable costs of purchasing , treating , and pumping less water . <p> The utility cost perspective measures a demand-management program 's net costs as incurred by the utility . Because this perspective treats revenue shifts as transfer payments , there is no uncertainty about longterm rate projections . The utility cost perspective includes only the portion of the participant equipment cost that is paid for by the utility-provided incentive . Therefore , this perspective reflects only a portion of total resource costs . Also , because revenue shifts are treated as transfer payments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The total resource cost perspective combines the economic effects of a program on both the customers participating and those not participating in a program . It measures the net costs of a program as a resource option based on the total costs of the program . The societal perspective on benefits and costs goes beyond the total resource perspective in that it attempts to quantify the total resource cost as a whole rather than the cost to only the water-service area , which includes the agency and its ratepayers . The societal perspective also includes the effects of externalities , such as environmental impacts and other external costs and benefits . <p> Discounting future costs and benefits to their present worth is an important part of the benefit-cost analysis . It allows the comparison of alternatives with very different patterns of costs and benefits over time . Discounting highlights the " time preference " according to which , if all else is equal , everyone would prefer to have their benefits earlier and costs later . The selection of the discount rate to be used in the calculation of present worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be used in the societal perspective is the most problematic because it should reflect a long-term rate of interest chargeable to society as a whole . Typically , societal discount rates between three and five percent are used in benefit cost analyses of water-conservation measures. 16 <p> Table 2 on this page shows an example of the results of a benefit-cost analysis developed for a citywide plumbing fixture retrofit program in Phoenix , Arizona. 17 The program was analyzed as one of 13 independent alternatives , 9 of which were found to have greater benefits than costs from the total resource cost perspective . The retrofit program was projected to produce water savings ranging from 8,370 acre-feet per year in 1990 ( approximately 3 percent of total water use ) to 3,235 acre-feet per year in 2035 ( 0.6 percent of total use ) . The costs of the program were calculated assuming a unit cost of $15 per installed retrofit kit . The benefits included energy cost savings of $43 per year for homes with electric heaters and $9 per year for homes with gas furnaces ; the utility 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $3.27 per 1,000 gallons of water treated and delivered , depending on which water sources , treatment plants , and demand areas were involved ; and the one-year delay of construction costs for one water-treatment plant and two waste-water-treatment plants . At a 4-percent discount rate , the benefit-cost ratio from the total resource cost perspective was 16.5 , and the net benefits of the program exceeded $88 million dollars . Taking Hold <p> In recent years , water resources planning has broadened to include a number of unconventional solutions to water-supply problems . Water-demand management has captured the attention of water planners as a promising alternative to the development of new water supplies . Urban water suppliers ' experience with longterm water-demand management programs is limited , however . In the past , this experience was limited only to drought emergency programs , such as water-use restrictions and rationing . Today , the majority of urban suppliers are practicing or considering some demand-management measures . <p> Several urban areas in the United States have implemented or are experimenting with large-scale , long-term measures aimed at a permanent modification of water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are leading the nation in the development of short-term demand-reduction programs as part of their drought contingency plans . The districts in the northwestern and southwestern regions of Florida are also active in long-term modification of water demand . Leading cities in other states include Phoenix and Tucson , Arizona ; Denver , Colorado ; Boston , Massachusetts ; Seattle , Washington ; and Austin , Texas . Across the U.S. borders , Mexico City and the province of Ontario in Canada are significantly improving the efficiency of urban water use . Probably the most advanced demand-management programs , however , can be found among the urban water suppliers in California , especially in the San Francisco Bay area and in southern California . <p> Undoubtedly , all of the engineering , economic , social , and environmental implications of demand management are not fully understood , and further research and experience will provide useful information . Some gaps in knowledge are often seen as major impediments to the implementation of demand-reduction programs and to the use of projected conservation savings in long-term water-supply plans . Water planners are primarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Because the success of demand-reduction programs depends on the cooperation of individual water users , the projected water savings are often viewed as not as reliable a supply as entirely new sources would be . Although the procedures for reliably estimating the water savings should be standardized , the uncertainties associated with demand-management programs are comparable to those associated with supply-side alternatives . If only a fraction of the research funds spent on investigations in hydrology was allocated to research on water-demand modeling and the scientific evaluation of demand-reduction programs , the concerns of water professionals about demand-management programs would quickly disappear . Once the magnitude of uncertainty is known , water planners will have little difficulty in developing adequate water-management plans . <p> Despite these uncertainties , the technology and impacts of an increasing number of demand-management alternatives are well enough understood to permit their comparison with alternatives involving the development of new water supplies . The very real benefit of demand management can only be realized , however , if the expected water savings are taken into account in planning capital facilities for water supply and wastewater disposal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Municipal and Industrial Water Use in the Metropolitan Water District Service Area : Interim Report No. 4 ( Los Angeles : Metropolitan Water District of Southern California , June 1991 ) .
