OUTSIDE UPPSALA on a late December afternoon in 1777 , a figure tucked in a small sleigh ordered his coachman to keep driving . <p> " Hammarby , " he said . " Please . " <p> The words were cracked , almost unintelligible . The coachman was afraid . At home he had a wife , two daughters , and a mother-in-law , all dependent on him ; his employers had strictly forbidden him to take the sleigh beyond the city limits , and he feared for his job . But his master was dying , and these afternoon drives were his only remaining pleasure . He was weak and depressed , and it had been months since he 'd voiced even such a modest wish . <p> How could the coachman say no ? He grumbled a bit and then drove the few miles across the plain without further complaint . <p> It was very cold . The air was crisp and dry . The sun , already low in the sky , made the fields glitter . Beneath the sleigh the snow was so smooth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrapped in sheepskins , watched the landscape speeding by and thought of Lapland , which he 'd explored when he was young . Aspens and alders and birches budding , geese with their tiny yellow goslings . Gadflies longing to lay their eggs chased frantic herds of reindeer . In Jokkmokk , near the Gulf of Bothnia , the local pastor had tried to convince him that the clouds sweeping over the mountains carried off trees and animals . He had learned how to trap ptarmigan , how to shoot wolves with a bow , how to make thread with reindeer tendons , and how to cure chilblains with the fat that exuded from toasted reindeer cheese . At night , under the polar star , the sheer beauty of the natural world had knocked him to the ground . He had been twenty-five then , and wildly energetic . Now he was seventy . <p> His once-famous memory was nearly gone , eroded by a series of strokes  --  he forgot where he was and what he was doing ; he forgot the names of plants and animals ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own name . His mind , which had once seemed to hold the whole world , was now occupied by a great dark lake that spread farther every day and around which he tiptoed gingerly . When he reached for facts they darted like minnows across the water and could only be captured by cunning and indirection . Pehr Artedi , the friend of his youth , had brought order to the study of fishes , the minnows included . In Amsterdam Artedi had fallen into a canal after a night of beer and conversation and had been found the next morning , drowned . <p> The sleigh flew through the snowy landscape . His legs were paralyzed , along with one arm and his bladder and part of his face ; he could not dress or wash or feed himself . At home , when he tried to rise from his armchair unaided , he fell and lay helpless on the floor until his wife , Sara Lisa , retrieved him . Sara Lisa was busy with other tasks , and often he lay there for some time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uppsala , and he was beyond her reach . The horses pulling him might have been reindeer ; the coachman a Lap dressed in fur and skins . Hammarby , the estate he 'd bought as a country retreat years ago , at the height of his fame , was waiting for him . The door leading into the kitchen was wide , and the sleigh was small . Linnaeus gestured for the coachman to push the sleigh inside . <p> The coachman was called Pehr ; a common name . There had been Artedi , of course , and then after him all the students named Pehr : Pehr Lofling , Pehr Forskal , Pehr Osbeck , Pehr Kalm . Half of them were dead . This Pehr , the coachman Pehr , lifted Linnaeus out of the sleigh and carried him carefully into the house . The kitchen was clean and almost bare : a rough table , a few straight chairs . <p> Pehr set Linnaeus on the floor , propped against the wall , and then he went back outside and unhitched the horses and shoved the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fireplace . He was very worried and feared he had made a mistake . His master 's face was white and drawn and his hand , gesturing from the sleigh to the door again and again , curled like a claw . <p> " Fire ? " Linnaeus said , or thought he said . At certain moments , when the lake receded a bit and left a wider path around the shore , he was aware that the words coming out of his mouth bore little resemblance to the words he meant . Often he could only produce a syllable at a time . But he said something and gestured toward the fireplace , and Pehr had a good deal of sense . Pehr lifted Linnaeus back into the sleigh , tucked the sheepskins around his legs and his torso , and then built a fire . Soon the flames began to warm the room . The sky darkened outside ; the room was dark except for the glow from the logs . Pehr went out to tend to the horses and Linnaeus , staring into the flames , felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this house and added several wings ; on the hill he 'd built a small museum for his herbarium and his insect collection and his rocks and zoological specimens . In his study and bedroom the walls were papered from ceiling to floor with botanical etchings and prints , and outside , among the elms and beyond the Siberian garden , the glass bells he 'd hung sang in the wind . In his youth he had heard the cries of ptarmigan , which had sounded like a kind of laughter . The fire was warm on his face and his hands , and when Pehr returned from the horses Linnaeus gestured toward his tobacco and his pipe . <p> Pehr filled the pipe , lit it , and placed it in his master 's mouth . " We should go back , " he said . " Your family will be worried . " Worried was a kind word , Pehr knew ; his master 's wife would be raging , possibly blaming him . They were an hour late already , and the sun was gone . <p> Linnaeus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very pleased with himself . The fire was warm , his pipe drew well , no one knew where he was but Pehr and Pehr had the rare gift of silence . A dog lying near the hearth would have completed his happiness . Across the dark lake in his mind he saw Pompey , the best of all his dogs , barking at the water . Pompey had walked with him each summer Sunday from here to the parish church and sat in the pew beside him . They 'd stayed for an hour , ample time for a sermon ; if the parson spoke longer they rose and left anyway . Pompey , so smart and funny , had learned the pattern if not the meaning . When Linnaeus was ill , Pompey left for church at the appropriate time , hopped into the appropriate bench , stayed for an hour , and then scampered out . The neighbors had learned to watch for his antics . Now he was dead . <p> " Sir ? " the coachman said . <p> His name was Pehr , Linnaeus remembered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There had been others , too : those he had taught at the university in Uppsala and those he had taught privately here at Hammarby . Germans and Danes , Russians and Swiss , Finns and a few Norwegians ; a Frenchman , who had not worked out , and an American , who had ; one Englishman , still around . And then there were those he had hardly known , who had come by the hundreds to the great botanic excursions he 'd organized around the city . Dressed in loose linen suits , their arms full of nets and jars , they had trailed him in a huge parade , gathering plants and insects and herding around him at resting places to listen to him lecture on the treasures they 'd found . They were young , and when he was young he had often kept them out for twelve or thirteen hours at a stretch . On their return to the Botanic Gardens they had sometimes been hailed by a kettledrum and French horns . Outside the garden the band had stopped and cheered : Vivat scientia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his work . <p> The coachman was worried , Linnaeus could see . He crouched to the right of the sleigh , tapping a bit of kindling on the floor . " They will be looking for you , " he said . <p> And of course it was true ; his family was always looking for him . Always looking , wanting , needing , demanding . He had written and taught and lectured and tutored , traveled and scrabbled and scrambled ; and always Sara Lisa said there was not enough money , they needed more , she was worried about Carl Junior and the girls . Carl Junior was lazy , he needed more schooling . The girls needed frocks , the girls needed shoes . The girls needed earrings to wear to a dance where they might meet appropriate husbands . <p> The three oldest looked and acted like their mother : large-boned , coarse-featured , practical . Sophia seemed to belong to another genus entirely . He thought of her fine straight nose , her beautiful eyes . When she was small he used to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand between his knees and listen . Now she was engaged . On his tour of Lapland , with the whole world still waiting to be named , he 'd believed that he and everyone he loved would live forever . <p> Now he had named almost everything , and everyone knew his name . How clear and simple was the system of his nomenclature ! Two names , like human names : a generic name common to all the species of one genus ; a specific name distinguishing differences . He liked names that clearly described a feature of the genus : Potamogeton , by the river ; Drosera , like a dew . Names that honored botanists also pleased him . In England the King had built a huge garden called Kew , in which wooden labels named each plant according to his system . The King of France had done the same thing at the Trianon . In Spain and Russia and South America plants bore names that he 'd devised , and on his coat he wore the ribbon that named him a Knight of the Polar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Queen , was dead ; and also Sjup the raccoon and the parrot who had sat on his shoulder at meals and the weasel who wore a bell on his neck and hunted rats among the rocks . <p> There was a noise outside . Pehr leapt up , and a woman and a man walked through the door . Pehr was all apologies , blushing , shuffling , nervous . The woman touched his arm and said , " It was n't your fault . " Then she said , " Papa ? " <p> One of his daughters , Linnaeus thought . She was pretty , she was smiling ; she was almost surely Sophia . The man by her side looked familiar , and from the way he held Sophia 's elbow Linnaeus wondered if it might be her husband . Had she married ? He remembered no wedding . Her fiance ? Her fiance , then . Or not : the man bent low , bringing his face down to Linnaeus 's like the moon falling from the sky . <p> " Sir ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moments in which no words were possible was upon him . He gazed at the open , handsome face of the young man , aware that this was someone he knew . The man said , " It 's Rotheram , sir . " <p> Rotheram . Rotheram . The sound was like the wind moving over the Lapland hills . Rotheram , one of his pupils , not a fiance at all . Human beings had two names , like plants , by which they might be recalled . Nature was a cryptogram and the scientific method a key ; nature was a labyrinth and this method the thread of Ariadne . Or the world was an alphabet written in God 's hand , which he , Carl Linnaeus , had been called to decipher . One of his pupils had come to see him , one of the pupils he 'd sent to all the corners of the world and called , half-jokingly , his apostles . This one straightened now , a few feet away , most considerately not blocking the fire . What was his name ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he Lofling , then ? Or Ternstrom , Hasselquist , Falck ? <p> The woman frowned . " Papa , " she said . " Can we just sit you up ? We 've been looking everywhere for you . " <p> Sophia . The man bent over again , sliding his hands beneath Linnaeus 's armpits and gently raising him to a sitting position . He was Hasselquist or Ternstrom , Lofling or Forskal or Falck . Or he was none of them , because all of them were dead . <p> Linnaeus 's mind left his body , rose and traveled along the paths his apostles had taken . He was young again , as they had been : twenty-five , thirty , thirty-five , the years he had done his best work . He was Christopher Ternstrom , that married pastor who 'd been such a passionate botanist . Sailing to the East Indies in search of a tea plant and some living goldfish to give to the Queen , mailing letters back to his teacher from Cadiz . On a group of islands off Cambodia he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death . <p> But he was not Linnaeus . He was Fredrik Hasselquist , modest and poor , who had landed in Smyrna and traveled through Palestine and Syria and Cyprus and Rhodes , gathering plants and animals and keeping a diary so precise that it had broken Linnaeus 's heart to edit it . Twice he had performed this task , once for Hasselquist , once for Artedi . After had berated Linnaeus for luring her husband the drowning , he had edited Artedi 's book on the fish . Hasselquist died in a village outside Smyrna , when he was thirty . <p> Of course there were those who had made it back : Pehr Osbeck , who had returned from China with a huge collection of new plants and a china tea set decorated with Linnaeus 's own flower ; Marten Kahler , who 'd returned with nothing . Kahler 's health had been broken by the shipwreck in the North Sea , by the fever that followed the attack in Marseilles , by his endless , grinding poverty . The chest containing his collections had been captured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Rolander , Daniel Rolander  --  was that the man who was with him now ? <p> But he had said Ro . . . , Ro . .. Rotheram , that 's who it was , the English pupil . Nomenclature is a mnemonic art . In Surinam the heat had crumpled Rolander 's body and melted his mind . All he brought home was a lone pot of Indian fig covered with cochineal insects , which Linnaeus 's gardener had mistakenly washed away . Lost insects and a handful of gray seeds , which Rolander claimed to be pearls . When Linnaeus gently pointed out the error , Rolander had left in a huff for Denmark , where he was reportedly living on charity . The others were dead : Lofling , Forskal , and Falck . <p> Sophia said , " Papa , we looked all over  --  why did n't you come back ? " <p> Pehr the coachman said , " I 'm sorry , he begged me . " <p> The pupil  --  Loping ? - said , " How long has he been weeping like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pehr was fine . Someone , not Pehr or Sophia , was laughing . Linnaeus remembered how Lofling had taken dictation from him when his hands were crippled by gout . Lofling was twenty-one , he was only a boy ; he had tutored Carl Junior , the lazy son . In Spain Lofling had made a name for himself and had sent letters and plants to Linnaeus ; then he 'd gone to South America with a Spanish expedition . Venezuela : another place Linnaeus had never been . But he had seen it , through Lofling 's letters and specimens . Birds so brightly colored they seemed to be jeweled and rivers that pulsed , foamy and brown , through ferns the height of a man . The letter from Spain announcing Lofling 's death from fever had come only months after little Johannes had died . <p> There he sat , in his sleigh in the kitchen , surrounded by the dead . " Are you laughing , Papa ? " Sophia said . " Are you happy ? " <p> His apostles had gone out into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and feet , observing , gathering , naming . Someone was stroking his hands . Pehr Forskal , after visiting Marseilles and Malta and Constantinople , reached Alexandria one October and dressed as a peasant to conceal himself from marauding Bedouins . In Cairo he roamed the streets in his disguise and made a fine collection of new plants ; then he traveled by Suez and Jedda to Arabia , where he was stricken by plague and died . Months later , a letter arrived containing a stalk and a flower from a tree Linnaeus had always wanted to see : the evergreen from which the balm of Gilead was obtained . The smell was spicy and sweet but Forskal , who had also tutored Carl Junior , was gone . And Falck , who had meant to accompany Forskal on his Arabian journey , was gone as well  --  he had gone to St. Petersburg instead , and then traveled through Turkestan and Mongolia . Lonely and lost and sad in Kazan , he had shot himself in the head . <p> Outside the weather had changed , and now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Osbeck or Rolander  --  Rotheram , who had fallen ill several years ago , whom Sophia had nursed , who came and went from his house like family  --  said , " I hate to move you , sir ; I know you 're enjoying it here . But the rain is ruining the track . We 'll have a hard time if we do n't leave soon . " <p> Rolander ? There was a story about Rolander which he had used as the basis for a lecture on medicine and , later , in a paper . Where had it come from ? A letter , perhaps . Or maybe Rolander had related it himself , before his mind disintegrated completely . On the ship , on the way to Surinam , he had fallen ill with dysentery . Ever the scientist , trained by his teacher , he 'd examined his feces and found thousands of mites in them . He held his magnifying glass to the wooden beaker he 'd sipped from in the night , and found a dense white line of flour mites down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mast of his boat , where he remained two days and two nights without food . <p> Hasselquist died in the village of Bagda . <p> Pehr Kalm crossed the Great Lakes and walked into Canada . <p> In Denmark , someone stole Rolander 's gray seeds , almost as if they 'd truly been pearls . <p> Generic names , he had taught these pupils , must be clear and stable and expressive . They should not be vague or confusing ; neither should they be primitive , barbarous , lengthy , or difficult to pronounce . They should have significant metaphorical or historical associations with the character of the genus . Another botanist had named the thyme-leaved bellflower after him : Linnaea borealis . One June , in Lapland , he had seen it flourishing . His apostles had died in this order : Ternstrom , Hasselquist , Lofling , Forskal , Falck , and then finally Kahler , at home . His second son , Johannes , had died at the age of two , between Hasselquist and Lofling ; but that was also the year of Sophia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tray full of dishes , he had secretly bought a new set to replace them , to spare her from her mother 's wrath . <p> His apostles had taken wing like swallows , but they had failed to return . Swallows wintered beneath the lakes , or so he had always believed . During the autumn , he had written , they gather in large groups in the weeds and then dive , resting beneath the ice until spring . An English friend  --  Collinson , Peter in his own tongue but truly Pehr , and also dead  --  had argued with him over this and begged him to hold some swallows underwater to see if they could live there . Was it so strange to think they might sleep beneath the water above which they hovered in summer ? Was it not stranger to think they flew for thousands of miles ? He knew another naturalist who believed that swallows wintered on the moon . But always there had been people , like his wife , who criticized his every word . <p> He had fought off all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carl von Linne now . But the pupils he 'd sent out as his eyes and ears were dead . During his years in Uppsala he had written and lectured about the mud iguana of Carolina and Siberian buckwheat and bear-berries , about lemmings and ants and a phosphorescent Chinese grasshopper . Fossils , crystals , the causes of leprosy and intermittent fever  --  all these things he had known about because of his pupils ' travels . Over his bedroom door he 'd inscribed this motto : " Live blamelessly ; God is present . " <p> A group of men had appeared to the left of the fire . Lofling , Forskal , Falck he saw , and also Ternstrom and Hasselquist . And another , whom he 'd forgotten about : Carl Thunberg , his fellow Smalander . <p> Thunberg was back , then ? Thunberg , the last he had heard , was still alive . From Paris Thunberg had gone to Holland . From Holland he had gone to the Cape of Good Hope , and then to Java and finally to Japan . In Japan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , isolated like all the foreigners . So desperate had he been to learn about the Japanese flora that he had picked daily through the fodder the servants brought to feed the swine and cattle . He had begged the Japanese servants to bring him samples from their gardens . <p> Of all his pupils , Thunberg had been the most faithful about sending letters and herbarium specimens home . He had been scrupulous about spreading his teacher 's methods . " I have met some Japanese doctors , " he 'd written . " I have been teaching them botany and Linnaean taxonomy . They welcome your method and sing your praises . " He had also , Linnaeus remembered , introduced into Japan the treatment of syphilis by quicksilver . He had left Japan with crates of specimens ; he 'd been headed for Ceylon . But here he was , sharp-featured and elegant , leaning on the mantelpiece and trading tales with his predecessors . <p> " The people are small and dark and suspicious of us , " he was saying . " They find us coarse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways of stunting trees that I have never seen before . " <p> " In Palestine , " Hasselquist replied , " the land is so dry that the smallest plants send roots down for many feet , searching for buried water . " <p> " The tropics can not be described , " Lofling said . " The astonishing fertility , the way the vegetation is layered from the ground to the sky , the epiphytes clumped in the highest branches like lace .... " <p> " Alexandria , " Forskal said . " Everything there is so ancient , so layered with history . " <p> " My health is broken , " Falck said , and Kahler said , " I walked from Rome almost all the way to Sweden . " <p> In Lapland , Linnaeus said silently , a gray gnat with striated wings and black legs cruelly tormented me and my most miserable horse . His apostles did not seem to hear him . A very bright and calm day , he said . The great Myrgiolingen was flying in the marshes . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tall woman said . " We 'll put you to bed . Wo n't you like that ? " <p> Her face was as radiant as a star . What was her name ? Beside her , his apostles held leaves and twigs and scraps of blossoms , all new and named by them with their teacher 's advice . They were trading these among themselves . A leaf from a new succulent for a spray from a never-seen orchid . Two fronds of a miniature fern for a twig from a dwarf evergreen . They were so excited that their voices were rising ; they might have been playing cards , laying down plants for bets instead of gold . But the woman and the other pupil did n't seem to notice them . The woman and the other pupil were wholly focused on helping Pehr the coachman push the sleigh back outside . <p> The woman opened the doors and held them . Pehr and the pupil pushed and pulled . The crisp , winy air of the afternoon had turned dank and raw , and a light rain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he turned and gazed over his shoulder . The group gathered by the fireplace stepped back , displeased , when Pehr returned and doused the fire . Thunberg looked at Linnaeus and raised an eyebrow . Linnaeus nodded . <p> In the hands of his lost ones were the plants he had named for them : Artedia , an umbelliferous plant , and Osbeckia , tall and handsome ; Loeflingia , a small plant from Spain ; Thunbergia with its black eye centered in yellow petals and the tropical Ternstroemia . There were more , he could n't remember them all . He 'd named thousands of plants in his life . <p> Outside , the woman and the pupil separated . Sophia ? Sophia , my favorite . Sophia bundled herself into the borrowed sleigh in which she 'd arrived ; the pupil wedged himself into Pehr 's sleigh , next to Linnaeus . In the dark damp air they formed a line that could hardly be seen : Pehr 's sleigh , and then Sophia 's , and behind them , following the cunning signal Linnaeus had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pehr huddled into his coat and gave the signal to depart . It was late , and he was weary . To their left , the rain and melting snow had turned the low field into a lake . Linnaeus looked up at his pupil  --  Rotheram ? Of course it was him : the English pupil , the last one , the one who would survive him  --  and tried to say , " The death of many whom I have induced to travel has turned my hair gray , and what have I gained ? A few dried plants , accompanied by great anxiety , unrest , and care . " <p> Rotheram said , " Rest your head on my arm . We will be home before you know it .
