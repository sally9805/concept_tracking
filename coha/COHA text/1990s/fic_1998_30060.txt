NOW ... During the events of Star Wars : Return of the Jedi The live ones are worth more than the dead ones . That was the general rule of digital appendage for bounty hunters . Dengar hardly had to remind himself of it as he scanned the bleak and eye-stinging bright wastes of the Dune Sea . Right now he 'd spotted a lot more dead things than living , which all added up to a big zero for his own credit accounts . I 'd have done better , he told himself , getting off this miserable planet . Tatooine had never been any luckier for him than it 'd been for any other sentient creature . Some worlds were like that . His luck was n't as bad as some others ' had been -- Dengar had to admit that . Especially when , as his plastoid-sheathed boots had trudged up another sloping flank of sand , a gloved fist had seized on his ankle , toppling him heavily onto his shoulder . " What the --  " His surprised outcry vanished echoless across the dunes as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holster . He held his fire , seeing now just what it was that had grabbed on to him . His fall had pulled a hand and arm free from the drifting sands that formed the shallow grave for one of Jabba the Hutt 's personal corps of bodyguards . Some reflex wired into the dead warrior 's battle-glove had snapped the dead hand tight as a womp-rat trap . Dengar reholstered his blaster , then sat up and began peeling the fingers away from his boot . " You should 've stayed out of it , " he said aloud . The Dune Sea 's scouring wind revealed the corpse 's empty eye sockets . " Like I did . " Getting into other creatures ' fights was always a bad idea . A whole batch of the galaxy 's toughest mercenaries , bounty hunters included , had gone down with the wreckage of Jabba the Hutt 's sail barge . If they 'd been as smart as they 'd been tough , Dengar himself would n't have been out here right now , searching for their weapons and military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boot free and stood up . " Better luck next time , " he told the dead man . His advice was too late to do that one any good . In his own memory bank , Dengar filed away the image of the corpse , with its clawing fingers and mouth full of sand , as further proof of what he 'd already known : The guy who comes along after the battle 's over is the one who cleans up . In more ways than one . He stood at the top of the dune , shielding his eyes from the glare of Tatooine 's double suns , and scanned across the wide declivity in front of him . The forms of other warriors and bodyguards , sprawled across the rocky wastes or half-buried like the one left a few meters behind , showed that he 'd found the still and silent epicenter of all that fatal action he had so wisely avoided . More evidence : Bits and pieces of debris , the wreckage of the repulsorlift sail barge that had served as Jabba 's floating throne room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the canopy that had shaded Jabba 's massive bulk from the midday suns now fluttered in the scalding breezes , blaster fire and the impact of the crash having torn the expensive Sorderian weftfabric to rags . Dengar could see a few more of Jabba 's bodyguards , facedown on the hot sand , their weapons stolen by scavenging Jawas . They would n't be fighting anymore to protect their boss 's wobbling bulk . Even in this desiccating heat , Dengar could smell the sickly aftermath of death . It was n't unfamiliar to him -- he 'd been working as a bounty hunter and general-purpose mercenary long enough to get used to it -- but the other scent he 'd hoped to catch , that of profit , was still missing . He started down the slope of the dune toward the distant wreckage . There was no sign of Jabba 's corpse , once Dengar reached the spot . That did n't surprise him as he used a broken-shanked scythe-staff to poke around the rubble . Soon after the battle , he 'd seen a Huttese transport lifting into the sky ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spot . The ship undoubtedly had had Jabba 's body aboard . Hutts might be greedy , credit-hungry slugs -- a trait Dengar actually admired in them -- but they did have a certain feeling toward the members of their own species . Kill one , he knew , and you were in deep nerf waste . It was n't sentimentality on the part of the other Hutts , so much as a wound to their notorious megalomania , mixed with a practical self-interest . So much for Luke Skywalker and the rest of them , thought Dengar as the point of the staff revealed sticky and distasteful evidence of Jabba 's death . As if that little band of Rebels did n't have enough trouble , with the whole Empire gunning for them ; now they 'd have the late Jabba 's extended clan after them as well . Dengar shook his head -- he would 've thought that Skywalker and his pal Han Solo would have , at the least , an appreciation of the Hutt capacity for bearing grudges . Even without Jabba 's obese form rotting under the thermal weight of the suns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of chain , the broken metal at its end twisted by blaster fire . The last time he 'd seen this hand-forged tether , back at Jabba 's palace , it 'd been fastened to an iron collar around Princess Leia Organa 's neck . Now the links were crusted with the dried exudations from Jabba 's slobbering mouth . The Hutt must 've died hard , thought Dengar , dropping the chain . A lot to kill there . He 'd gotten an account of the fight from a couple of surviving bodyguards that had managed to drag themselves back to the palace . When Dengar had left , to come out here to the Dune Sea wastes , most of the remaining thugs and louts were busily smashing open the casks of off-planet claret in the cool , dank cellars beneath the palace , and getting obliterated in a orgy of relief and self-pity at no longer being in Jabba the Hutt 's employ . " Yeah , you 're free , too . " Dengar picked up an unsmashed foodpot that the toe of his boot had uncovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorite trufflites , scrabbled against the ceramic lid embossed with the distinctive oval seal of Fhnark &; Co. , Exotic Foodstuffs-WE CATER TO THE GALAXY 'S DEGENERATE APPETITES . " For what it 's worth . " His own tastes did n't run to the likes of the pot 's spidery , gel-mired contents ; he hooked a gloved finger in the lid 's airhole and pried it open . The nutrient gases hissed out ; they had sustained the delicacy 's freshness , all the way from whatever distant planet had spawned it . " See how long you last out there . " The trufflite dropped to the sand , scrabbled over Dengar 's boot , and vanished over the nearest dune . He imagined some Tusken Raider finding the little appetizer out there and being completely perplexed by it . One substantial piece of wreckage remained , too big for the Jawas to have carted away . The hardened durasteel keelbeam of the sail barge , blackened by explosions that had destroyed the rest of the craft , rose at an angle from where the stern end was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the curved metal , nearly a meter in width , and climbed the rest of the way up to where the barge 's bow had been , and now only the exposed beam was left , tilted into the cloudless sky . He wrapped one arm around the end , then with his other hand unslung the electrobinoculars from his belt and brought them up to his eyes . The rangefinder numbers skittered at the bottom of his field of vision as he scanned across the horizon . This was a pointless trip , Dengar thought disgustedly . He leaned out farther from the keelbeam , still examining the wasteland through the ' binocs . His bounty-hunting career had never been such a raging success that he 'd been able to refrain from any other kind of scrabbling hustle that chanced to come his way . It was a hard trade for a human to get ahead in , considering the number of other species in the galaxy that worked in it , all of them uglier and tougher ; droids , too . So a little bit of scavenger work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been if he had found any survivors out here that could either pay him for their rescue or that he could ransom off to whatever connections they might have . The late Jabba 's court had been opulent -- and lucrative -- enough to attract more than the usual lowlifes that one encountered on Tatooine . But the bunch of rubble Dengar had found out here -- the few scattered and pawed-over bits of the sail barge and the smaller skiffs that 'd hovered alongside as outriders , the dead bodyguards and warriors -- was n't worth two lead ingots to him . Anything of value was already trundling away in the Jawas ' slow , tank-treaded sandcrawlers , leaving nothing but bones and worthless scrap behind . Might as well just stay here , he thought . And wait . He 'd sent his bride-to-be , Manaroo , aloft in his ship , the Punishing One , to do a high-altitude reconnaissance of the area . Soon enough she 'd be finished with the task , and would come back to fetch him . The knot of frustration in Dengar 's gut was instantly replaced with surprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the electrobinoculars cut across his throat as they flew away from his eyes . He held on with both hands as the beam pitched skyward , as though it were on a storm-tossed ocean of water rather than sand .
