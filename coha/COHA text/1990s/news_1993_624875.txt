<p> Last summer , when Houston 's Dr. Joseph Painter was voted president-elect of the American Medical Association , he knew that health care reform was necessary . <p> But Painter , a Texas native who assumes his office as AMA 's president in Chicago Wednesday , also knew that how the problem would be addressed depended on the the outcome of the Presidential compaign . <p> So he played a waiting game , knowing , he said , " health care would become a hot issue if Clinton was elected and less so if Bush was elected . " Now that President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton have taken on the health care problem with vigor , Painter , 65 , has to play another waiting game until they are ready to reveal the details of the program . <p> As vice president of health policy and a longtime physician at the University of Texas M.D.Anderson Cancer Center , Painter understands the problems faced by the current system and he has been among those pushing for change . <p> Anderson treats many people who either have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Insuring that everyone has access to health care is a key to reform as is containing health costs , Painter said during a recent interview . <p> But just as he hopes the current plan will help solve those problems , he is also concerned that the proposal allow physicians and patients more freedom . <p> " " What we 're hopeful of is that whatever plan comes out will put the patient driver 's seat , " Painter said . " " We hope that they would continue a pluralism of systems so the patient can choose his or her doctors , hospital and system of getting medical care . " <p> He brings a Texas perspective to his new role . He was born in Austin , went to college at UT there and received his medical degree from the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston . <p> Painter treated patients in Houston as a private practitioner of internal medicine for 21 years before going to work for Anderson and thinks the doctor-patient relationship has to work for health care to be effective . <p> It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AMA since he became a member of its House of Delegates in 1971 and served on its board of trustees beginning in 1984 . <p> During that time , he has seen major changes in the way health care is delivered with a sharp turn from individual practice and more insurance and cost-driven health plans such as health maintenance organizations and preferred provider plans . <p> He does n't oppose those , but he wants patients to be able to choose from indemnity , health maintenance organizations and managed competition . <p> But while Painter and other AMA leaders meet frequently with Ira Magaziner , the administrative director of the President 's Health Care Task Force , they continue to be out of the loop as far as the details of the system that now probably will not be revealed until July or August . <p> " The secrecy of the task force has really been a major problem , " Painter said . " It means that whatever comes out will not have stood the test of open discussion . <p> In fact , both Hillary Rodham Clinton and Vice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the public that special interest groups that have , in the past , thwarted attempts at reform will not do so this time . <p> Nor will they dictate the path that reform will take , Gore said in a spring meeting of AMA members held in Washington , D.C <p> Painter said AMA leaders have also been concerned about the lack physician input . <p> " As far as we can tell , few if any physicians on the task force have really taken care of patients on a day-to-day basis , " Painter said . <p> A 40-member physician task force has met only a few times , Painter said , " " but what input they will have is as yet unclear . " <p> What concerns him is a lack of detail . <p> For example , both doctors and the Clinton Administration agree that malpractice reform is needed . <p> But while Painter prefers a system such as California 's , with caps on damages for pain and suffering and various regulations on the way claims are paid , the administration has been touting enterprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care entities in which the doctors worked rather than the physicians themselves . <p> It would be up to the health care institutions that are in danger of being sued to make sure that the physicians they hire or contract with are of good caliber and character . <p> What Painter fears is that this will be seen as " deeper and deeper pockets that will run up the costs of medical care and increase defensive medicine " by physicians and health care institutions that fear suits . " We do n't see it as a solution , " he said . <p> Whatever the resolution , he wants to see that patients keep more of the awards in malpractice cases and less go to attorneys ' fees and administrative costs . <p> Painter wants a reduction in medical regulation that he says increases costs , but he fears that what will be proposed will be more cumbersome than what the nation already has . <p> And at the same time , he points out that reducing the cost of health care means addressing societal issues that literally make people sick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alcolhol " and all those personal habit-related things that are interwoven into the fabric of our society . " <p> " Solutions that will lessen those problems do impact significantly on costs , " he said . <p> Whatever the plan , he wants to make sure that research into new treatments and the training of doctors , nurses and other health care providers will be encouraged under the system . In particular , he said the administration needs to address the lack of primary care doctors to treat the nation 's minor ails before they become catastrophic illnesses . <p> " Some challenges are awaiting us , " he said . " Clearly , our focus is basically on waiting to see what Mr. Clinton will do . " " " It 's hard to be against something when you do n't know what is actually being proposed . " The AMA will analyze the plan and send that analysis to each physician in America , Painter said . <p> Then he hopes doctors will educate patients about what the plan means to them . <p> " If there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and everyone else , it 's be patient . There 's some uncertainties at the moment , but do n't get stampeded into making changes before we really know what is being proposed . <p> " " We 're concerned that whatever is proposed not be too complex , too confusing and too bulky . It will get bogged down . Then we will be back where we were , trying to Band-aid a system without changing the fundamental way in which medical care is delivered , " Painter said .
