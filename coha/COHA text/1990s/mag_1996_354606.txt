THE TWO POLES OF SUPPORT holding up Pat Buchanan are polar opposites . Bay , sister , spitfire campaign chairman , is the prototype of the postfeminist woman . She works round the clock , rears three kids on her own , yet insists that she 's a traditionalist . Shelley , wife , constant campaign companion , is an unrepentant prefeminist . She defines herself almost exclusively through her husband and prefers it that way . For a premodern man like Pat , independence may be tolerable in a sister but never in a spouse . <P> As campaign chairman , the tall and taut Bay is mostly behind the scenes , plotting strategy , raising money , orchestrating commercials . Pat calls her every 30 minutes to check in . Bay is the personification of his barking inner voice , goading him to run for President , something she has been doing for a decade . Whereas Bay talks nonstop in her brother 's rat-a-tat style , Shelley is painfully reticent . Her only public role is to smile serenely , sit behind the candidate onstage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biggest applause getters : " I want to introduce the lady I intend to nominate to replace Hillary Rodham Clinton , and she wo n't be in charge of health care . " Her private role seems to be the health and care of the candidate . When Pat toiled at the Reagan White House , recalls Linda Chavez , who worked alongside him , " Shelley would mark up newspapers for him , load his briefcase , drop him off and pick him up . " Her job description is the same today . <P> In a sense , the two women correspond to the yin and yang of Buchanan 's own personality . The slash-and-burn , take-no-prisoners campaign chairman reflects Pat 's public persona , while the gracious lady of the house reflects the private Pat , whom his former colleague Michael Kinsley once described as " gentle " and almost everyone else considers amiable . <P> Some have noted with irony that the candidate who wrote that the " Momma bird builds the nest " and that women are " less equipped psychologically " to succeed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those observers miss the point , for to the candidate , the issue is not gender but loyalty . From both Bay and Shelley , he receives unquestioned fidelity . Buchanan has referred to his sister as " my Bobby Kennedy . " Says Chavez : " This is n't a job to Bay . This is family . " For Shelley , it 's not a job ; it 's her life . <P> Loyalty in the Washington home of the Buchanan clan was next to godliness . Bay , whose given name is Angela , the younger daughter in a family of seven boys and two girls , gets her nickname from the mispronunciation of her older brothers : she was the " bay-bay . " Within the family , Bay was more the rebel than Pat . After getting her master 's degree in mathematics and working on Nixon 's re-election committee , she was so disillusioned by Watergate that she upped and moved to Australia . When she converted to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints and married a Mormon lawyer in 1982 , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as did his dutiful third son Patrick . Her divorce was equally sacrilegious . <P> After working for Ronald Reagan in his 1976 and 1980 presidential campaigns , Bay at 32 became the youngest U.S. Treasurer in history , in 1981 . She later set up shop as a political consultant in California and became a candidate herself in 1990 , running unsuccessfully in the G.O.P. primary for California state treasurer .
