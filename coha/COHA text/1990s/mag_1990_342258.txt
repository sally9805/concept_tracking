The wives of the Prophet Muhammad were vibrant , outspoken women . His first , Khadija , ran a prosperous trading business and at one point was Muhammad 's employer . A'isha , the Prophet 's favorite , was at various times a judge , a political activist and a warrior . Among Muhammad 's 11 other wives and concubines were a leatherworker , an imam and an advocate of the downtrodden , revered in her day as the " Mother of the Poor . " <P> Some women hold relatively high positions in Muslim countries today . But if the wives of Muhammad lived in parts of the contemporary Islamic world , they might be paying a high price for their independence . Consider events in the refugee centers of Peshawar , Pakistan , where more than a dozen Afghan women have been " disappeared " by radical Islamic groups for the crime of working in women 's centers or with foreign aid organizations ; or an episode in the Algerian town of Mascara , where a Muslim nurse was doused with alcohol and set on fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treating male patients . <P> While such violence represents an extreme , women are under fire wherever Muslim zealots are on the march . Following the Iranian revolution of 1979 , which swept away progressive legislation passed under the shahs , extremists in many Islamic countries have whittled away at the legal rights of women . In Egypt , for instance , the Supreme Court in 1985 struck down a 1979 law that gave a woman the right to divorce her husband should he take a second wife . Sudan 's military regime , which seized power in 1989 , refuses to allow women who are not accompanied by a father , husband or brother to leave the country without permission from one of the three . <P> The Family Code adopted by Algeria in 1984 gave a husband the right to divorce his wife for almost any reason and eject her from the family home . During debate over the code , one legislator actually proposed specifying the length of the stick that a husband may use to beat his wife . Algeria 's Islamic Salvation Front , which swept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work outside the home . <P> Pressures to curtail the rights of women come from various puritanical sects within Islam . " They want to impose a new social order by force , " says Khalida Messaoudi , president of an Algerian women 's organization . " They start by attacking women because women are the weakest link in these societies . " Particularly strict is the Wahhabiyah , a movement founded in the 18th century that counts among its adherents many Afghans and the Saudi ruling family . Wahhabi women live behind the veil , are forbidden to drive , and may travel only if accompanied by a husband or a male blood relative . The demands of the gulf crisis prompted the Saudis to loosen some constraints on women , but it is not clear that such liberalizations will endure . <P> Some Muslim women argue that the zealots are perverting the very religion they claim to hold so dear . " This terrifying image of unhappy women covered in veils is not Islam , " says Leila Aslaoui , an Algerian magistrate . Certainly , Muhammad was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around his various households , mended his own clothes and believed sexual satisfaction was a woman 's right . The religion he founded outlawed female infanticide , made the education of girls a sacred duty and established a woman 's right to own and inherit property .
