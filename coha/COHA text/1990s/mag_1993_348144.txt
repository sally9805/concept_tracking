TELEVISION <P> Return to Lynchville <P> HAS TV DOMESTICATED DAVID LYNCH ? IT was looking bad for a while . After giving the medium a jolt with Twin Peaks , he let the series run too long on circuit overload . His next show , On the Air , was a heavy-handed TV satire just slightly to the left of WKRP in Cincinnati . But the old , weird Lynch is back in HOTEL ROOM , an HBO trilogy of stories , two of them directed by Lynch from scripts by Barry Gifford . A hooker ( Glenne Headly ) is caught in a psychological sparring match between a seedy customer and his mysterious friend ; a husband ( Crispin Glover ) tries to rescue his bereaved wife from madness during a power blackout . The dialogue has the evocative spareness of Pinter , and Lynch 's control of mood  --  menacing , mesmerizing  --  has never been more sure . <P> CINEMA <P> Fight to the Finnish <P> FINLAND 'S MOST DISTINGUISHED WRITER-director is named Aki Kaurismaki . That statement is true and probably funny  --  like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that some viewers take it for tragedy . This sly parable starts with a brisk documentary on the transformation of a stick of wood in a box of matches , then spends the rest of its 70 minutes on the transformation of Iris ( Kati Outinen ) , the stolid young woman on the assembly line , into a keg of emotional dynamite . Kaurismaki 's almost-silent movie features a cast of rats  --  mother , stepfather , brutal beau  --  for whom rat poison may be the best antidote . And for U.S. viewers , Match Factory is a splendid introduction to a world-class ( no joke ) filmmaker , with a wit as dry as kindling . <P> BOOKS <P> Great Speculations <P> WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF YOU COULD ride on a light beam ? Albert Einstein posed himself that playful question ; his answer was the special theory of relativity , which utterly changed how scientists see time and space . Writers have tried to explain relativity ever since , but Alan Lightman , who teaches physics and writing at M.I.T. , has an entirely new approach . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ novel , an impressionistic look at thoughts the great physicist might have had while concocting his theory . We are privy to musings about worlds where time runs backward or branches into diverging streams . The writing , beautifully simple , conveys better than most texts the strangeness of Einstein 's ideas . <P> MUSIC <P> Passion Play In Three Acts <P> EXTREME HAS FOUND A LARGER FOLlowing beyond the MTV set with acoustic rhythms and four-part harmonies that downplayed its heavy-metal heritage . Now that fans are hooked , though , the group is upping the dosage of metallica . Its latest album , III Sides to Every Story ( A &M),; not only reminds listeners that guitarist Nuno Bettencourt is a mean riffer but also harks back to the roots of rock opera , taking on epic proportions in the process . Divided into three acts , the album is full of social commentary denouncing war in cynical , hard- cutting tracks . One standout : the haunting Rest in Peace , which knocks flower-child cliches such as " Give peace a chance " and " Make love not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fare
