Last week 's Moscow summit had been billed as the final act of the cold war . But within hours after Air Force One touched down at Sheremetyevo Airport , it was clear that the last vestiges of East-West tension had dissolved long before George Bush 's arrival . In what both sides agreed was the friendliest U.S.-Soviet summit ever , Bush and Mikhail Gorbachev laughed and joked their way through the signing of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty ( START ) , which will reduce the two superpowers ' nuclear arsenals , and a series of other agreements covering everything from agriculture to the arts . Bush agreed to try to provide Moscow with additional economic and technical aid . He also did his part to keep Gorbachev 's restive empire from flying apart by traveling to Kiev to warn the Ukrainian legislature against any adventures in " suicidal nationalism . " <P> As the Bush motorcade arrived in Kiev , the streets were crowded with nationalist spectators , many of them waving the blue-and-yellow flag of the once independent Ukrainian state . But he made it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the republics and Gorbachev 's central government . " We will not try to pick winners and losers in political competitions between republics , or between republics and the center , " said the President . " ( ( That ) ) is your business , not the business of the U.S. " <P> But Bush 's comments on Soviet internal politics were overshadowed by the hope that the new spirit of U.S.-Soviet cooperation might spread to the Middle East . Secretary of State James Baker , with some important help from Moscow , persuaded Israel to sit down with its Arab neighbors in face-to-face peace talks that could begin in October . Bush hailed the coming peace conference as a " historic opportunity " for a comprehensive Arab-Israeli settlement after 43 years of war and confrontation . <P> Bush and Baker traveled to Moscow with every intention of bringing Israel to the table . Egypt , Lebanon , Jordan and Syria had already accepted Israel 's long-standing demand for bilateral talks . But Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir had one last concern : the composition of the Palestinian delegation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talks by Yasser Arafat 's Palestine Liberation Organization . It also opposes the inclusion of any resident of East Jerusalem , a step that in Shamir 's view might imply that the city 's status as Israel 's capital is open to negotiation . <P> To overcome Shamir 's qualms , Bush and Gorbachev staged a diplomatic squeeze play . Baker holed up in Moscow and spent hours on the telephone trying to bring Shamir around . When Bush and Gorbachev announced on Wednesday  --  before any public announcement from Shamir  --  that they would issue invitations to an October peace conference , it seemed like a classic bit of diplomatic arm twisting directed at the recalcitrant Israelis . Bush said he was sending Baker to Jerusalem immediately " to obtain Israel 's reply . "
