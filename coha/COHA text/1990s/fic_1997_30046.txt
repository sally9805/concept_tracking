He stood on the highest point on the planet of Almania , the roof of a tower built by the once-powerful Je'har . The tower was in ruin , the stairs crumbling as his boots touched them , the roof littered with debris from battles years gone . From here , though , he could see his city , a thousand lights spread before him , the streets empty except for droids and the ever-present guards . But he was not interested in looking down . He wanted to see the stars . An icy wind rippled his black cloak . He clasped his gloved hands behind him . The death's-head mask he had worn since destroying the Je'har hung on a silver chain around his neck . Above him the stars winked . Hard to believe worlds existed there . Worlds he would control . Soon . He could have waited in his command , stood in the observatory specially constructed for his needs , but for once , he wanted no protective walls around him . He wanted to feel the moment , not see it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength of the Force . He tilted his head back and closed his eyes . No explosion this time . No bright flare of light . Skywalker had told him of the moment when Alderaan died . I felt a great disturbance in the Force , the old man had said . At least , that 's what Skywalker told him . This disturbance would not be as great , but Skywalker would feel it . All the young Jedi would feel it too , and they would know that the balance of power had shifted . But they would n't know that power had shifted to him . To Kueller , Master of Almania , and soon , lord of all their pitiful worlds . * * * The stone walls were damp and cold against Brakiss 's unprotected hands . His polished black boots slipped against the crumbling steps , and more than once he had to balance on a precarious ledge . His silver cloak , perfect for a brisk stroll across the city , did not protect him against the winter wind . If this experiment worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where he would at least be warm . The remote 's metal casing was cool against his fingers . He had n't wanted to give it to Kueller until the experiment was over . Brakiss had n't realized , until a few moments ago , that Kueller would wait for the results here , at the site of his enemies ' triumph and their eventual deaths . Brakiss hated the towers . It felt as if something still raffled in their walls , and once , when he was in the catacombs below , he had seen a large white ghost . Tonight , he had climbed more than twenty stories , and had almost run the first flights until it became clear that some of the steps would n't hold his weight . Kueller had n't summoned him , but Brakiss did n't care . The sooner he left Almania , the happier he would be . The stairs twisted and finally he reached the roof -- or what he thought was the roof . A stone hut had been built to protect the steps , but the hut had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good view of the gravel inlay surface , and of the star-filled sky . Stones had fallen out of the hut and shattered onto the rooftop . The remains from bombs and blaster concussions formed little mounds on what had once been a level plane . Kueller had not repaired the tower or the other Je'har government buildings . He never would . Kueller never forgave anyone who crossed him . Brakiss shuddered and clutched his thin cape tightly around his shoulders . His frozen fingers barely got a grip on the material . " I told you to wait below . " Kueller 's deep voice carried on the wind . Brakiss swallowed . He could n't even see Kueller . The starlight fell across the roof , giving the dark sky a luminescence that Brakiss found eerie . He climbed the remaining stairs and stepped out of the hut . A gust of wind knocked him against the stone . He braced himself with his right hand , losing his grip on his cloak . The fastener tugged against his neck as the wind made the material flutter behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " You 'll know when it works . " Kueller 's voice was a live thing . It surrounded Brakiss , resonated within him , and held him at bay . Brakiss concentrated , not on the voice , but on Kueller himself . And finally saw him , standing near the edge , overlooking the city below . Stonia , the capital of Almania , looked small and insignificant from this height . But Kueller looked like a powerful bird of prey , his cape billowing in the wind , his broad shoulders suggesting great physical strength . Brakiss took a step forward when suddenly the wind died . The air around him froze and so did he . In that moment , he heard -- felt -- saw -- a million voices scream in terror . The terror rose in him , and he saw again that moment when Master Skywalker led Brakiss deep into Brakiss 's own heart , that moment when he saw himself clearly and nearly lost his mind -- A scream formed in his own throat -- And died as the other screams exploded around him , filling him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He felt stronger , larger , more powerful than he ever had before . Instead of fear , his heart felt an odd , twisted joy . He looked up . Kueller had raised his arms , his head tilted back , his face uncovered for the first time in years . He had changed , his skin filled with a knowledge Brakiss was n't sure he wanted . And yet ... Yet Kueller glowed , as if the pain of those million voices had fed something within him , had made him even greater than he had been before . The wind returned , its frigid gusts knocking Brakiss against the stone . Kueller did n't seem to feel it . He laughed , a deep , rumbling sound that shook the entire tower . Brakiss braced himself against the stone . He waited until Kueller 's arms fell to his sides before saying , " It worked . " Kueller slipped the mask over his face . " Well enough . " Such an understatement for such a great moment . Kueller had to remember that Brakiss was strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cape swirling around him . He almost appeared to fly . The skull-like mask that adhered to his face shone with its own internal light . " I suppose you want to return to your paltry job . " " It 's warm on Telti . " " It could be warm here , " Kueller said . Brakiss shook his head almost involuntarily . He hated Almania . " Your problem is that you do not understand the power of hate , " Kueller said , his voice soft . " I thought you said my problem is that I serve two masters . " Kueller smiled , the thin lips on his mask moving with his mouth . " Is it only two ? " The words hung between them . Brakiss 's entire body felt as if it were made of ice . " It worked , " he said again . " I suppose you expect to be rewarded . " " You promised . " " I never promise , " Kueller said . " I imply . " Brakiss crossed his arms over his chest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be angry . " You implied great wealth . " " So I did , " Kueller said . " Do you deserve great wealth , Brakiss ? " Brakiss said nothing . Kueller had put him together after Yavin 4 , after the disastrous debriefing that had nearly cost Brakiss the rest of his sanity . But Brakiss had long since repaid his debt . He only stayed because he had nowhere else to go . He pushed off the wall and started down the stairs . " I 'm going back to Telti , " he said , feeling defiant . " Good , " Kueller said . " But you will give me the remote first . " Brakiss stopped and looked at Kueller over his shoulder . Kueller had grown taller in the last hour . Taller and broader . Or perhaps that was a trick of the darkness . If Brakiss had faced any other mortal , he would have asked how Kueller knew about the remote . But Kueller was not any other mortal . Brakiss held out the remote . " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fine . " " You have to set the security codes . You have to instruct it which serial numbers to follow . " " I 'm sure I can do that . " " You have to link it to you . " " Brakiss , I can operate remotes . " " All right , " Brakiss said . He braced himself as he moved inside the stone hut . It was warmer in there , out of the wind . He did n't believe Kueller was letting him leave so easily . " What do you want from me , when I return to Telti ? " Brakiss asked . " Skywalker , " Kueller said , his voice thrumming with the depth of his hatred . " The great Jedi Master , Luke the invincible Skywalker . " The chill had reached Brakiss 's heart . " What do you plan to do with him ? " " Destroy him , " Kueller said . " Just as he tried to destroy us. "              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
