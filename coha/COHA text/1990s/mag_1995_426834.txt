Section : GARDENS TO VISIT <p> At this midwestern mecca , gardeners gain inspiration from a rich diversity of plants and plantings <p> Chicago was built by dreamers . In 1837 the city picked Urbs in Horto ( " A City in a Garden " ) as its official motto . At the time , of course , there was very little " urbs " and even less " horto . " Still , the vision was there . The dream . Today the city soars skyward , surrounded by large stretches of forest preserve on its perimeter . Efforts are under way to restore patches of the native prairie that once blanketed the state . And fully cultivated public and private gardens abound , the most artfully crafted of them all being the Chicago Botanic Garden . <p> Now 30 years old , the 385-acre Botanic Garden occupies a series of nine islands encircled by lagoons that were created by diverting the nearby Skokie River . Part native habitat , part formal landscape , the grounds currently showcase some 18 different gardens . The youngest of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garden designer and author John Brookes . Among the oldest is the equally beloved Japanese Garden . In between are other highlights such as the Waterfall Garden , which drops 45 feet in a cascade over massive granite boulders ; the Fruit and Vegetable Garden , where the term " edible landscaping " becomes a reality ; and the Naturalistic Garden , which reveals the graceful beauty of midwestern native plants . Visually impaired visitors can enjoy multiple scents , sounds , and textures in the Sensory Garden , while the Enabling Garden proves that people with other disabilities can still participate in the pleasures of working with plants . <p> " People have the perception that you ca n't grow much in Chicago because of our extreme climate , " says Garden Director Kris Jarantoski . " But the Chicago Botanic Garden displays 7,000 different plants that can be grown here , and the number is increasing every year . We aim to show our 700,000 annual visitors the full diversity of plants that can be grown in this area and also how to use them in different situations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habitat is unique , " he continues . " Fully half of the site displays native plants , and that includes woodland , river , and prairie . We have an excellent balance of the naturalistic and the formal . " <p> The presence of water  --  75 acres in  --  all is another distinguishing feature , one that contributes greatly to the overall impression of vast , rolling space . Jarantoski speaks proudly of the " great vistas , sense of distance , and broad landscape within which there are very secure pockets that people can feel comfortable in . " Galen Gates , manager of horticulture collections , adds , " We are very cognizant of our prairie heritage , and we are always working to maintain our long , open vistas . " <p> But if it 's secure , comforting pockets you want , there is no better place to find them than in the English Walled Garden . An artful blend of formal design and lush , informal plantings , the garden offers a sampling of several English gardening styles . There 's a grand herbaceous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The vista garden , inspired by a similar space at Christopher Lloyd 's Great Dixter , serves up a typically midwestern touch with its view across the water to Evergreen Island and the prairie just beyond . Off in a corner you can sit in the kind of miniature courtyard that 's tucked behind many a London town-house . Just on the other side of the clipped checkerboard squares of an artemisia-and-boxwood parterre , Kentucky wisteria ( Wisteria macrostachya ) clambers up the pillars of a pergola . <p> Capping it all off is a formal daisy garden . While it may seem a contradiction in terms to arrange the jolliest of flowers in severe straight lines , this is Brookes 's most brilliant stroke . Although he generally left plant choices to the local staff , he specifically requested the ' Italian White ' sunflowers that consort so happily here with the American-born asters , coneflowers , and coreopsis . Even a stalk or two of the towering prairie dock ( Silphium terebinthinaceum ) has a place in these refined surroundings , looming over their shorter neighbors . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grand creation , its separate divisions ( rooms , if you will ) are small . And in each are many practical suggestions and ideas for the midwestern home gardener . Although the look is English , " the plants are those that do best in the Chicago area , " Jarantoski reiterates . " It gives wonderful landscaping ideas for small urban spaces . " Gates concurs . " Vignettes that you can take with you and plug in at home , " he says . <p> If the beauty of the English Walled Garden is predictable , it is more of a revelation to stroll over the bridge to the Fruit and Vegetable Garden and discover that this , too , is strikingly gorgeous . In June , the delights begin as soon as you set foot on the four-acre island and see robins feasting on the purple berries in a hedge of Amelanchier alnifolia ' Regent ' . Turn a corner , and here 's a ' Sensation ' peach growing contentedly in a four-foot-square wooden container . Walk along a flower-edged gravel path , and you see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall as an espalier . All told , the Garden showcases a couple dozen espaliered fruit trees , including ' Comice ' and ' Cascade ' pears , ' Stanley ' plum , and ' Lady ' , ' Red Chief ' , and ' Geneva Early ' apples . More apples , plus cherries , pears , pecans , and walnuts , are grown in orchards along the island 's perimeter . The produce is given to the Greater Chicago Food Depository . <p> While the fruit and nut trees are the stars of this garden , this is is not to minimize the pleasures and surprises found in the tidy brick-edged raised beds of flowers , vegetables , and herbs . Sage and ' Opal ' basil mix with Nicotiana ' Domino Salmon Pink ' in one bed . Another showcases oats , ornamental wheat ( ' Blocky ' ) , Amaranthus hypochondriacus , and chives . A third is given over entirely to a planting of jicama and a fourth to a comparison planting of various onions . Elsewhere , the edible and the ornamental fill containers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arbors . <p> As one would expect , the Botanic Garden includes a rose garden as well . Gates and his colleagues , however , are shifting away from hybrid teas and grandifloras to more shrub and landscape types of roses . Gates gives special nods of approval to ' Carefree Beauty ' , ' Carefree Wonder ' , ' The Fairy ' , ' New Dawn ' , ' Henry Kelsey ' , and ' Henry Hudson ' . The garden has grown David Austin 's new English roses with mixed results , but ' Graham Thomas ' has done well . For what it can provide in terms of foliage and texture , Rosa glauca comes highly recommended . <p> In the future , the staff of the Chicago Botanic Garden plans to increase its research efforts , primarily in the areas of native plants and ecosystems . A new plant resource center has just been built and a director of research hired to run it . The demonstration prairie , created to show five different prairie types plus an oak savanna , is nearing completion and will provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ native ecosystems . In addition , the Botanic Garden will be expanding its educational outreach programs . <p> And then there 's all that water  --  not just the 75 acres inside the garden , but also five miles of shoreline . " Water will definitely be a major focus in the future , " explains Kris Jarantoski . " We want to develop the shoreline , some of which has become eroded , as a model of how this can be done . Eventually we want to have one of the premier aquatic gardens in the world . " <p> PHOTOS ( COLOR ) : The six sections of the English Walled Garden each display a different gardening style .
