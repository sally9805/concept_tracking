IMAGINE MAKING a phone call on a clear night and having a trailer roll up to your door with all the equipment necessary to conduct a free , firstclass star party ! That dream is just about reality for the Cleveland Regional Association of Planetariums with the spring 1994 inauguration of the Mobile Observatory Project . A group of astronomy teachers in the greater Cleveland , Ohio , area , including me , had been trying for several years to find an observing site for staff and students . We found many park and private locations , but no one wanted a permanent observatory built on their property . Just as the search was beginning to look hopeless , I came up with an idea . Why not take the observatory to the students ? Driving home from work one afternoon , I saw a 28-foot camper trailer and van for sale . Looking the vehicles over , I realized it might be easier to have a mobile observatory than to transport students to a remote site . With minor changes the trailer could be equipped with portable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - all the equipment necessary for a traveling facility . However , our school district did not have the funds necessary to equip a mobile observatory . We presented the idea at the September 1993 meeting of the Cleveland Regional Association of Planetariums , which includes 13 school districts that have planetariums and a smaller number of districts that teach astronomy without one . The concept was met with enthusiasm . Five districts contributed toward the purchase of the van and trailer , while private donations made up the balance . Loaner telescopes were obtained , and the trailer was remodeled .

We began writing for grants , with positive results . Soon we were able to support teacher and driver training as well as obtain computers , telescopes , binoculars , video equipment , and a generator . Eventually more than $20,000 was raised . The project was under way ! Meanwhile , the Euclid school district agreed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vehicles when they were not on loan . Each of the five school districts was allocated four weeks ' use of the Mobile Observatory . I attended amateur astronomy meetings and visited colleges to publicize the Mobile Observatory Project . Three Cleveland area clubs expressed interest in staffing the observatory , and we assisted two of them with public star parties during the summer of 1994 . The observatory took to the road that April , and by the end of May it had reached more than a thousand students as well as a respectable number of parents and teachers . Many people looked through a telescope for the first time . During the May 10th annular eclipse we held our official first-light kickoff , which was covered by television stations and newspapers . The participating school districts are still raising funds , as we hope to add more equipment ( including a computerized 8-inch telescope ) and cover operating expenses for the next four years If finances permit , we would like to purchase a portable planetarium as well as expand observatory use to 10 more school districts in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Observatory carries a minimum of five telescopes that are set up outside the vehicle . One has a motor drive that can be equipped with a video camera to provide group viewing of the Sun , Moon , and planets . Three rich-field telescopes , as well as 6- and 10-inch Dobsonians , are available for visual observing . We also have a WWV receiver to accurately time solar flares , occultations , and similar events . Photograph // An ST-4 CCD camera gives students imaging and photometry capabilities . Images can be processed and printed " in the field " using two onboard computers that are well supplied with software . Video images are available should the weather be inclement , as are NASA CD-ROM discs . The trailer also houses a library , including lesson plans , video and audio tapes , and laser discs .
