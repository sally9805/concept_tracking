Jean-Bertrand Aristide 's presidential palace was in a state of wild disarray all last week , though the Haitian government did manage to put on a fairly elegant reception for some 500 distinguished visitors and guests on the Saturday of Aristide 's return  --  a triumph all the more remarkable for the palace 's lack of running water . The President 's people had been especially nervous since a number of the invitees supported the 1991 coup d'etat against Aristide and were no doubt looking forward to a social debacle . But the Americans arrived with six portable toilets , and the Haitians lugged water up two flights of stairs to the reception level , and the party came off more or less without a hitch . <P> That was the new government 's first taste of what awaited it inside the palace , Haiti 's seat of government . The ritzy residential floor , decorated by Michele Duvalier in the slickest French style of the late 1970s , had not been occupied since Aristide 's quick exit in 1991 and was , according to a member of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and moldy and smelling faintly of sewage . The beautiful granite bathrooms had all been destroyed , their fixtures removed . <P> Upstairs in the President 's offices , the situation was worse . The computers Aristide had left behind when he was booted into exile had been stolen . Every last bit of office equipment was gone  --  Aristide 's staff members were still begging pens from journalists on the day after he arrived  --  and only a very few electrical outlets were working . As late as last Wednesday , there was still just one functioning phone in the entire palace . <P> Aristide wanted to spend his first night home at his private residence just outside town , but he was told by his security people that his safety there could not yet be guaranteed . So he chose to remain in the palace and slept in his office on a pull-out couch sent over by a helpful friend . There was no working shower ; the President had to bathe a la paysanne  --  peasant style  --  using buckets of water and a sink . <P> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more basic needs his government will have to address in its first few months in power . Schools languish in disrepair . Garbage is piled high around the capital , and the municipal dump is an unsightly waterfront horror that breeds disease . Roads are barely navigable ; in some places , the potholes have grown so large and deep that they are known in Haitian Creole as tonmbo , or tombs . At midweek , gasoline had still not made it to the nation 's pumps , and the stockpiled supplies of street dealers were dwindling . It was a characteristically Haitian irony that only when the embargo was over did the gas shortage begin . <P> Despite all the problems facing his country , and despite his difficulties bathing , Aristide is plainly delighted to be home . " Look , " he told Time , " obviously we 're not going to solve everything in our first few days , and if we just do n't shoot ourselves in the foot , we 'll be doing a good job .
