Section : Business MUSIC Motown is leaking money and struggling to produce hits . Can it be saved ? <p> IT WAS THE NIGHT OF THE MIKE Tyson-Evander Holyfield showdown . A hip crowd had gathered at the Beverly Hills mansion of record mogul Andre Harrell for a fight party : the kind of affair that he calls ghetto fabulous , ' an edgy mix of black attitude with upscale white richesse . Veronica Webb , the black supermodel , was there . So was hip-hop star Heavy D. The guests quaffed champagne and catered goodies from Georgia , bistro to the stars . And they talked business , scrupulously avoiding one sensitive topic . To wit : that Motown Records , once linked with a studio called Hitsville USA , has n't scored a single major hit during Harrell 's one-year reign as chief executive . Only two weeks earlier , in fact , Motown 's owner , PolyGram , blamed it for a major chunk of a $90 million revamping charge . Not to worry . Andre will prevail like the underdog Holyfield , ' predicts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> An underdog he is indeed . Partly it 's a generational thing . When Motown was founded 37 years ago by the legendary Berry Gordy , Harrell was a year from being born . When it released its first million-selling record , Smokey Robinson 's Shop Around , ' he was n't yet 1 . Now he is responsible for rebuilding this icon of pop culture : the first major , wholly black-owned record company , a label renowned worldwide for its Motown Sound ' and its roster of stars , from the Supremes to Marvin Gaye to Stevie Wonder . It 's a huge challenge . With only one major act , Boyz II Men , Motown is but a shadow of yesteryear , lately known more for unbridled spending and champagne soirees than for its music . Hitless and hemorrhaging money , Motown will rack up losses this year approaching $70 million , say PolyGram sources . And profits are n't expected until 1998 . Clamping down on Harrell , PolyGram CEO Alain Levy says through a spokeswoman , We 're being extremely specific ' about financial targets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to replace Harrell . <p> The tale of Motown 's woes is about more than corporate finance , or even Harrell 's short , sputtering tenure at the label . It offers a glimpse into the deep racial divide within the music industry . Motown 's early triumphs broke a pattern : while blacks birthed much of America 's music , from jazz to rock to blues , whites always had pocketed the receipts . As Motown grew from a mom-and-pop operation , though , its unique twist on popular music became irresistible to the big music business . Motown 's decline , writes music historian Nelson George , became almost inevitable as early as the ' 70s , when white-owned record giants , such as CBS Records ( now Sony Music ) , made a grab for the black-music business . Today , black music often dominates the charts and accounts for at least $3 billion of the $12 billion industry . Yet most black record labels , like Motown , are controlled by entertainment conglomerates run by white executives . The irony for Motown has been that it ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black talent . <p> Motown 's plight also reflects a troubling period in black music . There 's a crisis , ' says Antonio Reid , CEO of LaFace Records . There have been controversies over the violent content of rap , highlighted by the gangland-style murder of Tupac Shakur . There 's also a management crisis , namely the dearth of seasoned black executives in the industry 's business suites . Some critics , like producer James Mtume , believe that blacks ' exclusion has been systematic . Major music companies have dismantled black-music departments , cutting loose veteran black execs and farming out the business to upstart associated labels . Some in music 's white leadership now see the problem . Says Sony Music chief Thomas Mottola , As an industry , we really need to strengthen the whole black executive pool . ' <p> Harrell is arguably Exhibit A , say many industry insiders , black and white . He 's a proven talent spotter . Charming and visionary , he mentored Sean ( Puffy ) Combs , now one of music 's hottest producers , and introduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has had no experience managing an enterprise of Motown 's scope and complexity . Supporters say all he needs is more time , and they accuse PolyGram of singling him out when its other labels ( Island , Mercury and A &M); are n't burning up the charts , either . Detractors insist he has made some dumb mistakes , partly out of ego and hubris . Yet most agree that , ultimately , PolyGram is largely to blame for thrusting Harrell into a difficult situation for which he was ill prepared . Responds CEO Levy via a spokeswoman , It 's our business to grow people and judge executives . ' <p> More is at stake than Harrell 's career and a chunk of PolyGram 's mammoth , $300 million investment in the label . More important by far is the preservation of Motown 's special place in the American experience , and in African-American culture in particular . It would be difficult to exaggerate its magic . Motown 's allure is distinctive . In recent years , reissues of Motown classics by Marvin Gaye and others have earned some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , former execs estimate . And for a huge swath of American boomers , Motown remains a soundtrack from their halcyon days . The music helped define the turbulent 1960s and ' 70s ; the iconography of the three-headed Supremes is etched in our popular culture . For blacks , especially , Motown was an unambiguous symbol of success . <p> Andre Harrell must have pinched himself , then , when he got the call from Alain Levy , PolyGram 's French-born , London-based chief . Would he consider heading Motown ? Harrell had been recommended to Levy by his longtime pal Russell Simmons , the rap impresario . Simmons , who had sold half his Def Jam label to PolyGram in 1994 , had taken Harrell under his wing years before . Back then , Harrell was a stylish former rap artist striving to be the next Berry Gordy . In 1990 he struck gold , garnering a reported $50 million deal from MCA for his Uptown Records . <p> Outwardly , it seemed Harrell was on the Yellow Brick Road . Uptown hit with Jodeci and others . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's exploits as a member of Hollywood 's emerging black pack . ' But even then , there were hints of trouble . Many music-scene observers credited part of Harrell 's success to his protEgE , Combs , the producer who now heads the Arista-backed Bad Boy label . Then there was Harrell 's notorious penchant for busting budgets . While Uptown 's records went gold and platinum , Harrell 's lavish spending on videos and other promotions left Uptown strapped and bitterly at odds with MCA . Still , PolyGram paid dearly to free him from MCA . By Harrell 's own account , he received a $20 million signing check up front . His five-year salary contract is worth tens of millions of dollars in cash and stock options based on performance , says Tracy Maitland , one of Harrell 's Wall Street confidantes . <p> That PolyGram was willing to bet so big on Harrell reflected , in part , Levy 's disappointment with Motown . When he acquired it in late 1993 , Levy expected the company to have turned around by now . ( PolyGram had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had purchased it from Gordy for $60 million in 1988 and then dumped it amid a nasty fight with MCA , a partner in the venture . ) Enter Harrell , with Levy 's blessing and a blank check  --  which the new Motown chief wasted little time filling out . He promptly moved Motown to New York from Los Angeles . ( Maitland , Harrell 's Wall Street adviser , says Motown is now exploring a future move to Harlem . ) Once in New York , say insiders , some staffers routinely turned in $20,000 monthly bills for temporary quarters in hotels . Back in L.A. , meanwhile , Harrell threw himself a welcome bash at tony Le Dome , featuring a fountain flowing Cristal champagne ( $200 a bottle ) and a bevy of beauties hired from a modeling agency . That was penny ante , by Hollywood standards , but other forms of his largesse stunned even entertainment-industry veterans . One such : a hugely expensive and controversial self-promotion campaign , mounted before even a single album had hit the stores . At a cost variously estimated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York subways with billboards heralding Harrell 's move From Uptown to Motown ' and picturing him in a mogul 's pose , cigar in hand ensconced in a leather wingback chair . What did PolyGram 's brass think ? Alain advised him against it , ' says a spokeswoman . <p> Then came an eye-grabbing episode faxed around the industry : a Harrell interview last spring in a magazine published by his buddy Simmons . In it , Harrell bragged about his lavish spending and how his fly ' ( hip ) quotient had risen since he 'd come to Motown . The kind of numbers we 're talking about . . . that s  --  t 's like NBA superstar numbers , ' he boasted of his rich PolyGram deal . The fallout was quick . Motown artists  --  including Diana Ross , according to her acquaintances  --  began to grumble that too much of the label 's marketing-and-promotion budget was going to the boss 's image-building . If you create something , you 'd like to see something happen with it , ' says the manager of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ release he says is n't being pushed . Boyz II Men , the label 's biggest recent breadwinner , was miffed , going so far as to set up its own label to launch acts for a PolyGram rival , Sony Music . Harrell tore up the group 's old Motown recording deal and replaced it with a richer one , though the group 's Sony label continues . <p> If there is some unhappiness among Motown 's old stars , Harrell 's most recent hires have few complaints . He brought along some former Uptown staffers , paying them huge , controversial salaries . Even some industry lawyers negotiating for clients were taken aback . Harrell 's defense : he was merely trying to lift the pay of black execs to industry standards . And there were other flaps ; one high-level PolyGram insider mentions the case of a Motown executive who was fired and then rehired at more than twice his old salary . And what of the many talent-spotters Harrell brought aboard , the artist and repertoire ' staffers ? Some of them Motown desperately needed , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , according to Motown sources , was Harrell 's valet . <p> There were broken promises and bad- faith negotiations . Motown wooed Capitol Records executive Matt Robinson to run its soundtrack division . Later , Harrell installed another executive with a bigger title to do the same job , say Motown insiders . Robinson languished for weeks , without being told or paid , they add . Another time Harrell announced that gospel star Bebe Winans would be given a gospel label at Motown . Not quite so . They were close to a deal , Winans says , until Harrell belatedly insisted that he 'd have to record for Motown , not just run the gospel label . <p> Amid the disarray , industry insiders openly began to ask how long PolyGram would sit idly . Quietly , concern was growing deeper in parts of the black-music community , which badly wanted Harrell to succeed . Some blacks even believed PolyGram now wanted him to fail , possibly to make way for a white management team , betting no one could reasonably object . PolyGram says it was monitoring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had installed two PolyGram execs at Motown . Still , Levy had n't expected such exorbitant spending . <p> As the scrutiny of Harrell now grows , it 's important to remember that the daunting problems he faces might have stymied a seasoned chief . Many in the music industry  --  and even more fans  --  winced at his early preference for flash over substance . But sometimes people do the strangest things in big new jobs . In the record biz , though , one big hit can jump-start a turnaround . And Harrell has a track record of smash CD releases . Next year , Motown 's rap star Queen Latifah , Boyz II Men or an as-yet-undiscovered talent could quickly put the label back on the road to profits .
