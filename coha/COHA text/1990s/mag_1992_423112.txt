<p> Sharon Maczko builds small , theatrical sets that she furnishes and illuminates , and then uses them as the subjects of her large watercolors . While creating these imaginary locations , she explores the inner worlds of her emotions and childhood memories . <p> When seeking , artistic inspiration , some painters search for just the right play of light upon a landscape , a dramatic swell of surf on the beach , or a mysterious smile on the face of their model . But California artist Sharon Maczko has abandoned that artistic quest and relies instead on the inner world of her memories and emotions to provide the subject matter for her paintings . <p> Of course , the wise artist knows that personal experience must be translated into symbols with which the viewer can identify . Otherwise , the so-called art becomes nothing more than an attractive self-indulgence . Realizing this , Maczko has conceived an ingenious method of giving form and substance to her memories and feelings : by setting up detailed still life  --  actually more like small , constructed theatrical sets  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maczko 's works are not focused on simply creating the dreamy or nostalgic image , but rather on communicating her inner world and all that resides within it  --  childhood images , fears , fantasies , and the joy of play . The fact that Maczko is largely self-taught , with the exception of some high-school-level art studio courses , makes the portrait of this painter seem even more compelling and complex . <p> ILLUSTRATION : <p> Maczko spent several years after high school searching for her life 's " mission " and just generally growing up . She decided to return to her childhood interest in art and began designing signs and business cards for friends and acquaintances . Then she took a job doing pen-and-ink work for a landscape artist . Maczko was already living on her own in California  --  her family , originally from Michigan , had decided several years earlier to move back . That aloneness , she says , helped her become more focused and committed to her art . <p> She chose watercolor because , she says , " it seemed a less intimidating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a large space to work in  --  just paper , some colors , water , and a brush . " Maczko began working " dry-on-dry " because wet-in-wet seemed likely to present too many problems . Maczko 's earlier experiences with artistic failure  --  her high school art teacher would constantly belittle her work  --  made her quite cautious in her early attempts at painting land scapes . <p> Maczko worked from her own photos but soon found this unsatisfactory . " I take a good photo of my finished paintings , " says Maczko , " but I 'm an an inspired photographer of landscapes and just about anything else ! " <p> She had a seemingly limitless supply of ideas and feelings that she wanted to communicate through her paintings . But , she wondered , how should I visualize these ideas in order to paint them ? An avid collector of antiques ( or " old junk , " as the artist sometimes refers to them ) , one day Maczko set up a still life composed of some of these old-fashioned objects , and suddenly a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , the artist abandoned photographs as source material and began to paint the still lifes she now carefully assembles from her own collection and from found objects . Her new direction proved a success : one of her early still lifes , The Attic Floor #1 , won the artist first prize and a purchase award in the first juried exhibition she ever entered . <p> Always interested in the narrative aspect of representational art , Maczko found that her work was becoming more involved as she tried to choose objects and arrange still lifes that created a specific mood or emotion , a feeling of time or place . The artist discovered that she could maintain and develop a specific feeling or evoke a mood through a series of paintings , rather than attempting to say everything in just one . <p> She has found the watercolor medium particularly suited to such a series , since she can move quickly from one painting to the next . Moreover , she says that her series paintings create the effect of " something happening or the feeling that an event is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to become involved in my work . " <p> In her first series , entitled " The Bedroom Series , " Maczko explored the " world " of a young woman 's bedroom and how it becomes a place of solitude and reflection  --  a place of dreams and hopes , as well as sadness and fear . <p> The artist had such a bedroom in mind , but she needed to paint from something more tangible than the images in her mind 's eye . She began assembling another " still life , " but this time on a more complex and larger scale . <p> " I knew that one of the moods I wanted to portray was that of the restless , troubled feeling that comes at night when one is alone in a room and ca n't sleep , " she says , describing how she created Sleepless Night . " You toss and turn and watch the curtains blow in through the open window . Although the windows in my house were perfect for the image I wanted to convey , they were too large and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So I decided to build a smaller , working duplicate of one of these windows . " <p> In fact , she built more than a window : she constructed a small set , such as might be done for a local theatrical production . Using furring strips , Maczko made a window and went on to make the wall out of heavy mat board . Then she made the curtain ( she 's an avid seamstress and collector of fabrics ) . The dresser top , mirror , and lamp in Sleepless Night are real objects from her collection placed on top of what appears to be a chest of drawers ; they were actually positioned on a tabletop . She also constructed the vanity seen in The Apartment . She found the small artificial Christmas tree shown in that work at a swap meet in the middle of July . <p> Once all her props were in place and the lighting for the set was established , she completed what could be called a three-dimensional color preliminary for her painting . Then she began working on the watercolor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set . Once this drawing was completed , she began to paint . ( The artist sometimes takes as long as a week to do a detailed drawing prior to beginning a painting . ) <p> As Maczko continued the paintings in " The Bedroom Series , " her sets and props became more detailed . And as she thought about the " inner world " that this series was attempting to portray , she remembered her own childhood and became fascinated with the idea of exploring those special worlds that children create for themselves using anything at hand  --  from a large cardboard box to a sheet draped across two chairs . Once a child is inside such a magical world , the creative process often continues as the child fantasizes with toys or uses crayons and paint . <p> In " The Mind at Play Series , " Maczko says she wanted " to connect the energy that compels a child to create a personal space ( such as a cave in which to play and fantasize ) with the same urge that enables us , as artists , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studio . ' I found the similarities between the child and artist remarkable and amusing : both are often so engrossed in their creative activities that they become oblivious to the outside world . " <p> For this series , the artist again constructed sets that she used as reference material for her meticulously rendered paintings . These sets also include a myriad of interesting items  --  small treasures found among the junk at the swap meets and flea markets that the artist regularly visits . Some things , however , ca n't be purchased at a swap meet . For example , the hardwood floor that appears in some of the paintings in this series was actually built by the artist . The hardwood floor was made from one-half-inch-thick plywood , with the wood slats drawn on and then stained and varnished . <p> Once a set is constructed and finished to the last detail , Maczko spends a good deal of time with the lighting . She carefully positions her light sources , seeking just the right cast shadows and effects that will enhance her narrative . In " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ integral role in creating a mood , such as in The Mind at Play #9 , where light can be seen streaming through the louvered closet doors . <p> Light has an even more dramatic role in the artist 's series entitled " A Corner of the Universe " in which she created what she calls a universe of imagination . In these paintings , dramatic highlights and deep shadows create mystery and a feeling of infinite space . <p> For this series , she spent many hours doing research on the sizes and colors of the planets in our solar system . Then the artist built a 5 ' - x- 6 ' framework from furring strips . Across that framework , she draped tulle , the stiff transparent fabric used to make a ballerina 's tutu . Using painted Styrofoam balls , the artist suspended her planets from the tulle-draped framework . The effect recreated in her paintings from this series is literally out of this world , evoking the spirituality and infinity of space  --  just the right antidote for an artist whose inner worlds had started to become somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used a 22 " - x- 30 " sheet of 300-pound Arches watercolor paper . For her later series , she wanted a larger sheet . Always more interested in getting on to the next painting , she often overlooked certain details . When she asked the art store to order her a package of the next larger size , she assumed that would be 30 " x 40 " . When she got the package , she discovered that the next size was actually a single elephant , or 25 3/4 " x 40 " . As a result , the paintings in the series The Mind at Play and A Corner of the Universe have a somewhat oblong look . The artist found that she liked this size very much , although she occasionally still uses the 22 " - x- 30 " sheets . <p> Other than paper size , Maczko has changed little about her materials since she began painting , when simplicity and frugality were vital . Quality , however , is not something the artist is willing to sacrifice to economy . Her palette of Winsor &; Newton watercolors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gamboge , Winsor green , and lampblack , along with French ultramarine and permanent rose . Her Robert Simmons brushes are mostly Nos. 4 or 5 and never larger than a No. 10 . <p> Maczko does not use aids such as frisket , explaining , " The main reason that I am such a purist as a transparent watercolor painter is that when I started out , I did n't know there were such things as frisket to mask areas of pure white paper . So I just learned how to get the effects I wanted without them . " <p> This fresh and unaffected comment is indicative of the personal style and approach that set her apart from many other artists . " I went through a period , " she remarks , " when I thought I must get out and become current . I went around to all the art openings , read the art journals , saw all the shows . But I found that it confused and alienated me . My work is just not connected to what is fashionable or on the cutting edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me and my mind , rather than what 's outside in the world at large . " <p> Working with such personally connected subject matter requires not only the strength of conviction to swim against the tide , but also an awareness of the pitfalls inherent in such material , such as sentimentality and a decidedly feminine ambience . Maczko is aware of such potential problems : My paintings are often quite feminine , full of delicate textures and colors or feminine objects , and that feminine ambience can be off-putting to male viewers . " Since many dealers and collectors are male , such considerations take on a practical and financial aspect as well . Maczko thus keeps a careful watch on the emotional content of her work in order to create a painting that is compelling  --  one that does not simply present facile nostalgia or easy sentiment . <p> Indeed , many men  --  especially her husband  --  as well as women find themselves quite taken with Maczko 's paintings . The artist credits her husband 's unfailing support  --  financially and , particularly , emotionally  --  with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mission as an artist . <p> The artist looks forward to exploring new images with which to communicate her ideas and emotions . Her goal is not so much to sell every painting but for every painting to be seen . " It 's the communication that I 'm looking for , " she says . " I want my paintings to be seen so that their message , which is my personal message , can be transmitted . If they get sold , too , well , that 's a terrific extra . " <p> Maczko is currently at work on a new series that seems a logical sequel to her previous ones . In this new series ( as yet unnamed ) , the paintings are once again of interiors and inner worlds , yet they contain some intrusion from the outer world as well . For example , in Backyard , a teddy bear sits on a frilly , feminine bedspread in a young woman 's bedroom ; through the window can be seen a sky crowded with fighter planes and other images of war . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it will surely mark another significant progression in the career of this decidedly original watercolor painter . Her artistic worlds will intrigue viewers for many years to come . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Backyard , 1990 , watercolor , 25 x 40 .

There is a magical quality to this special world created by an unseen child . The dramatic cast shadows produced by the light coming through the louvered closet doors contribute to this magical effect . The viewer senses the presence of a mischievous child , who has littered the floor with cosmetics and scribbled on the wall . <p> BY DIANE CASELLA HINES <p>
