Willard Carroll is a cockeyed optimist . The writer-director of Playing by Heart thinks our dysfunctions are curable . Or at the very least transcendable . With a little help from the great cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond , he bathes this radically unfashionable idea in a glow so romantic that even Los Angeles , where most of his multicharacter , multigenerational saga takes place , is transformed . The world capital of road rage is returned , in his vision , to something like the balmy prettiness of its prelapsarian prewar era . <P> This is no accident . It is something like a moral imperative for Carroll . He wants us to understand that a prescription compounded of kindness , patience , civility and a touch of irony can work wonders on anger and despair  --  even when their cause is mortality itself . For at the heart of Heart are two stories in which couples are obliged to confront death . In one of them , a mother ( Ellen Burstyn ) and a son who is dying of AIDS ( Jay Mohr ) try to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days remaining to them . In the other , a long-married couple ( Sean Connery and Gena Rowlands ) are coping successfully with his incurable illness  --  until she finds evidence of a past betrayal that threatens to destroy the trust on which they have based their happy , privileged life . <P> These four are intended as exemplary figures . As we watch them struggling toward acceptance of harsh fates , we are encouraged to believe that everyone else in the film , whose bedevilments are merely romantic , can work things out as well . A colorful , often comic crew includes a woman ( Gillian Anderson ) so mistrustful of men that she keeps a mastiff to ward them off ; a guy ( Dennis Quaid ) mysteriously given to alternately angry and self-pitying ( but always noisy ) rants in restaurants ; a married woman ( Madeleine Stowe ) coldly addicted to a sexually stirring but loveless affair ; a lonely young actress ( Angelina Jolie ) hiding neediness under a brassy surface . Most of them find someone willing to help still the insanities that Carroll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his or her miseries and to a degree of hope for better times ahead . <P> Is there something a little too comfortable  --  and comforting  --  in the way this movie works out ? Possibly so . On the other hand , its emotional range is extraordinarily generous , the conflicts it permits its unimprovable cast to explore are well beyond the call of their usual duties . And Carroll orchestrates the several variations on his redemptive theme expertly , ultimately resolving them all in a way that is both surprising and satisfying . With the bitter taste of movies like Todd Soldonz 's Happiness  --  this film 's dark double  --  still on our tongues , still all the rage , one has to wonder whether the audience for serious movies is still capable of suspending disbelief in the common decency and common sense of middle-class Americans , whether it is willing to try a little tenderness  --  if only as a relief from chic transgressiveness . <P>  --  By Richard Schickel                 @ @ @ @
