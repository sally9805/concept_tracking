<p> The vocational high schools in Chicago are designed to prepare students for college as well as for the world of work . Dunbar Vocational High School graduates have entered colleges of their choice across the nation on academic and athletic scholarships . In addition , Dunbar has supplied the business and vocational professions with hundreds of employees , including Bernard Shaw of CNN , who was enrolled in the radio program at our school . <p> Not all students choose to go to college . Vocational education is being emphasized as an alternative to college in every school across the nation except Chicago . The politicians have chosen to eliminate vocational education in Chicago for reasons that are very difficult to comprehend . <p> The " 50-minute period " recently mandated by the Chicago <p> Board of Education to be implemented in all high schools has drastically reduced the quality of education offered and has completely disrupted the educational progress . We have experienced the following negative aspects of the 50-minute period at Dunbar : <p> The loss of classes needed by students for college entry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ programs . <p> Loss of teaching time in laboratory and vocational shop classes . <p> Extending the length of the instructional day , thereby eliminating student involvement in extra-curricular activities . <p> The 50-minute period mandate was an excellent way to render high schools ineffective and unable to produce quality students . <p> Dr. Floyd M. Banks , principal , <p> Dunbar Vocational <p> High School of Chicago <p> Child Visitation <p> A new state criminal law will substantially overhaul the system of enforcing visitation orders . This law may soon allow certain noncustodial parents , generally fathers , to have contact with their children with whom they may have otherwise lost all contact . <p> The new law will make " unlawful visitation interference " a crime effective Jan. 1 , 1994 . A third conviction of this new law is punishable by incarceration for less than one year . <p> The new law will most likely open the door for enforcement of visitation orders by the criminal courts and police , and will hopefully decrease the disruption of the father-child relationship . Added protection for children , who can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of visitation abuse , is another positive aspect of this law . <p> Noncustodians , usually fathers , often fight vigorously , and at times fruitlessly , for enforcement of visitation by the courts . <p> This new law will give fathers a less costly and less bureaucratic means to have uninterrupted time with their children . Often , denial of visitation has destructive effects on the child and the non-custodial parent . Studies have shown that the absence of the father causes adverse social , emotional , academic and psychological effects on children . For example , the Center for Disease Control and Prevention found that 85 percent of children with behavioral disorders came from fatherless homes . <p> This law should help facilitate visitation , strengthen the father-child bonds that ultimately should benefit the child , and blaze a new trail toward recognizing the rights of children . <p> Jeffery M. Leving , Loop <p> Aid Needed Here <p> At first I was steamed by the way the federal government is determined to send money by the billions to help one-time communist Russia move toward the free economy they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a chance this gesture may offer us a clue as to the state of our own economy . After all , would a caring and responsible government be funneling those billions to the Russians unless it had solid evidence that our homeless and hungry are cared for , our unemployment rate is minimal , our roads , bridges and railroads meet safety standards , and our environmental concerns are met ? <p> If these concerns have been met , then I still have that old nagging feeling that sending money to Russia may be just another case of Washington throwing dollars at a problem for which it has no real answer . Maybe I should be steamed after all ! <p> Thomas P. Fleming , Woodstock <p> Tax Burden Grows <p> My tax bill included a jump of 52.6 percent for just the Cook County tax . I asked several friends and neighbors and found theirs were similar , with the increases of 69.8 percent , 62.2 percent , 67.1 percent and 41 percent for just the County of Cook tax line . <p> Neither Cook County Board President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any explanation of this tremendous increase . No one hinted that it was coming , what it is for , or why my neighbors , friends and I should pay an average of $ 100 more this year . <p> I do n't believe government by edict , without facts , is a part of democracy . Setting and collecting taxes without the knowledge and support of the governed is just shoddy performance . <p> When this great increase is added to the .75 percent sales tax collected by Cook County starting last year , my taxes to Cook County have increased about 200 percent in the last two years . <p> Cook County owes a thorough examination of why this great increase has been collected . I hope the media will do an objective investigation of why Cook County government requires such rapidly escalating taxes  --  and why Cook County does such a poor job of getting taxpayer understanding and support for their taxing and spending actions . <p> William G. Kuntz , Park Ridge <p> Wrong Priorities <p> I have just read a letter ( Oct. 5 ) from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done all the right things , finds herself with few , if any support mechanisms from the government or social services . If she had gotten pregnant , had a drug habit or developed a criminal history , she would have people , government and social service agencies to help her . <p> You are told from a very young age to be a good Christian , to be a good student and have a strong work ethic . Do n't get pregnant until you are married ! Stay out of trouble ! Who is getting all the support from government ? Those who break all the rules . <p> So as far as I know , there is n't a definition for lovers of destructive people . For now , we can call such a person nihilophile . A nihilophile is a person who loves destructive people and destructive behavior . The people who write laws , govern and occupy positions of authority are obsessed with helping destructive , irresponsible people who are destroying the country . <p> Frances M. Johnson , <p> Near West Side <p> Lax Sentence <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentence because of health reasons ( " Ailing Cosentino Spared Prison Sentence for Fraud , news story , Sept. 24 ) ! Why ? Congestive heart failure and diabetes at 62 . He could live to be 100 with medication and proper care . Maybe with the money he embezzled , even longer . <p> I am so tired of those who commit white collar crimes only receiving a slap on the wrist . <p> Shall we keep in mind the judges sentencing these crooks ? Shall we remember the hands of justice tripped in favor of the criminal ? On Election Day , maybe we citizens can reverse the hands . <p> Willye Tillman , Kenwood <p> Phelan No Leader <p> Richard J. Phelan claims Illinois needs leadership , but that sure sounds funny coming out of his mouth . As its president , Phelan has completely divided the Cook County Board . He has broken his campaign promises to cut property taxes and to not raise sales taxes . What kind of leadership is that ? <p> Instead of focusing on alternatives , Phelan took the easy way and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be causing fiscal nightmares to taxpayers all over the state . <p> Ian Jourgensen , <p> Near North Side @x I paint from nature , from life . With my subject in front of me , I can observe the fall of light upon it , as well as any atmospheric effects surrounding it . I can also look for the larger concepts of form , shape , and movement in my compositions that will make for an interesting painting . For example , if one of my florals is taken out of focus , a larger shape will generally emerge . A bouquet of flowers becomes a spherical shape , or an egg shape , or even an S-shape ; and although the individual flowers are important , each is subordinate to the larger shape , concept , or idea . Renaissance artists relied on a few solid , basic compositional elements - including the cube , the triangle , and the sphere - and built their figure compositions , portraits , and still lifes on these stable formulae . The Baroque period of the 17th century stressed movement in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tool . This is the approach that appeals to me . Dutch masters , including Jan Davidsz de Heem ( 1606-ca. 1684 ) and Rachel Ruysch ( 1664-1750 ) , incorporated these principles into their painting ; studying their work can be enormously helpful . I like to build a design around a dynamic action line . In the following examples you will see that sometimes , like the Dutch masters , I will make use of the S - or even a backward S - as in my painting Valentine Bouquet . Note how in this painting the eye follows the light . It moves through the design from the yellow flowers on the left to the pink , orange , violet , pink , and then white flowers , before continuing down and across the composition to pick up the stem of the rose that lies on the table , ending at its tip . The surrounding flowers echo , or repeat , in darker colors and tonal values , the rhythm of the light just described . I used the tiny daisies and yellow buds to add sparkle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I use results in what I call the " waterfall effect . " In Glory of Summer I built a composition around a spherical concept that I enhanced with a waterfall of light and shape in the flowers , as well as in the vines . Here the white roses draw the eye into the composition before leading the viewer out toward the pinks and yellows , and then eventually to the light and shadows that pour outward in the shape of the vines . In Lilacs the arrangement follows the dynamic action of the Baroque diagonal . The cone-shape lilac stems complement this concept , which the white flowers enhance . The flowers radiate light outward and to the right , in keeping with my left-hand light source . I placed the cooler violet flowers ( made with a combination of alizarin crimson , ultramarine blue , and white ) on the far left , which allows them to merge with the darker violet mixtures of the shadows . The golden yellows in the background and foreground add complementary impact to the design of the painting . The action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In this work I created a sweeping motion throughout the composition , which I enhanced with the incorporation of light . There are actually three vases of flowers in the painting , as well as a grapevine . With the light source coming from the left , the yellow and red-violet flowers on the right stand out brilliantly . The dynamic action begins on the left with the grape leaves , leading the eye up and through the design , before sweeping down again to focus on the light and finally on the leaves . Sometimes I will use more than one design concept , as in Rhododendron , which makes use of an S - as well as a spiral shape . The dynamic-action line traces the floral from the background through the flowers bursting into the light , before it diminishes in intensity as it trails off to end in the foreground leaf . The spiral , or vortex , radiates outward from the center-most flower , which contains the brightest whites of the painting . Once again the light pattern relates to the overall design of the composition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the focus of light , which is also at the center of the piece . The leaves , stems , flowers , and twigs are all arranged in a spiral to create a vibrant and lively motion . Here again , the progression of shadow and light in the background gives added power to the design . In all of my paintings I use rich coloration and backgrounds that enhance the featured bouquet by creating depth through the progressions of light and shadow . I also pay attention to lost and found edges , which are critical to conjuring atmosphere and a sense of space . As I paint , I lay in the middle tones and local colors ; and as the painting develops , I build the lights , as well as the darks . I prefer to use the full range of the palette , reserving the deepest darks as accents for the final touches - often found in the center of a floral bouquet . Floral composition should not be static , dull , or boring . The painting concepts I 've outlined here allow the artist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of paint application , such as using thick or thin paint and different brush sizes , also gives the artist tremendous creative options that yield results as individual as handwriting . And of course , all artists should paint with a loaded brush !
