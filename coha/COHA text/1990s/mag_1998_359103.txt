Yvette Johnson was the kind of job applicant who makes employers dread hiring off the welfare rolls . She had been on welfare for six years . Jobs like cleaning hospital rooms and cutting vegetables ended with her quitting or being fired . And she had four kids who had to be shuttled to day care and baby-sitting . When Kimberly Randolph , an operations supervisor for the Sprint phone company in Kansas City , Mo. , met Johnson at a job fair , she pegged Johnson as " a job hopper , with a bad attitude . " But at her interview , Johnson made a plea . " That was me , and I know it does n't look good , " she said . " But give me a chance . " <P> Johnson took her chance and ran with it . She woke up at 5 a.m. and spent two hours on buses , dragging the kids to day care and then getting to training classes . For nine months now , she has been an operator at Sprint 's calling center at 18th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sits at a computer with a headset on , placing calls and billing calling cards . She handles 600 calls a day , at an average of 38 seconds a call . Already , she has racked up four " good customer-contact reports " from satisfied callers who put in a good word with her supervisor . <P> Johnson is part of a small but impressive welfare-to-work program Sprint began last October in one of Kansas City 's poorest neighborhoods . Sprint 's 18th-and-Vine call center employs 48 operators , half of whom were on public assistance . The center is meeting its performance standards , and its 77% retention rate is more than twice as good as Sprint 's call center in the Kansas City suburbs . That 's a big deal in an industry where every employee departure can mean $6,000 to $15,000 in lost training and productivity . Sprint is thinking about upping the 18th-and-Vine staff to 100 . <P> Sprint is n't alone on the welfare-to-work bandwagon . Of the top 100 U.S. companies , 34 have programs , and 13 more are planning them . Executives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barney were at the White House this spring toasting President Clinton 's one-year-old Welfare to Work Partnership and saying their welfare hires had better retention rates than workers found from other sources . Why the sudden success ? There 's the economy , which has made employers so desperate that some are hiring convicts to work in prison . And there 's welfare reform , which has drilled into recipients the fact that unemployment is no longer an option . <P> But welfare-to-work practitioners say one factor in its success has been a dramatic change in how welfare recipients are prepped for the work force . Old-fashioned job training used to teach typing or using computers but not the first thing about how to act on the job . The focus now is on " soft skills , " basics like showing up on time , dressing appropriately and not fighting with co-workers . " Employers are saying , ' Give us people with the right attitude and job readiness , and we 'll take care of the rest , " says Eli Segal , president of the nonprofit Welfare to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
