The story behind the 48-point whitetail that may become the highest-scoring Boone and Crockett deer ever taken by a hunter // Tony Fulton , a timber cruiser and log buyer from Louisville , Miss. , arrived home from work as usual on Thursday , Jan. 5 , 1995 . The cold , damp weather made the decision to stay home that afternoon easy . Besides , he already had taken three bucks under Mississippi 's liberal bag limit of five bucks per season . But when his wife , Ronda , gave him just the slightest bit of encouragement . " deer fever " hit and Fulton decided to spend the last hour of daylight hunting . He set off for a covered tree stand that he had built on locust poles at the edge of a new pine plantatoin that bordered a recently cut hardwood lot . Later , in a rich southern accent , Tony would recall his historic hunt for me : " I had only been in my stand 10 minutes when I heard antlers rattling through the trees and brush . The noise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buck , but I could n't see him . " Another 10 minutes went by and the noise got louder and closer . I started to get anxious . Then a doe ran into the field . about 50 yards in front of me , and stopped real quick . She turned around and looked directly at my stand . The wind was blowing straight at her . She ran back into the woods , and I thought to myself , " That 's the end of that , I sure wo n't see that buck now . ' " Just then the buck came out , He ran right to the spot where the doe had stood . He was looking away from me . I could see how wide his rack was and it had a ton of points . I could n't begin to tell how many . " The buck was only 50 yards out when he quartered away from me and took off after the doe . I shot once . " The deer did n't act like he was hit . He headed for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 10 seconds . " Fulton composed himself , climbed out of the stand and went to the spot where he had shot the deer . There was no blood . He followed the deep tracks of the running buck to the edge of the woods . Still no sign . By now it had gotten dark enough that Fulton decided to go back to his truck for a flashlight . THe forecast called for sleet and snow that evening , so he would have to pick up the tracks soon or face the possibility of never finding the deer of a lifetime . Fulton recalls thinking . " When you use a 30-06 with 150 grain bullets , you 're supposed to get something . That buck was n't supposed to run off like that . " After returning with the flashlight , Fulton finally spotted ad good blood trail . He found the buck less than 100 yards from where it had entered the woods . The sight of the downed trophy up close was staggering . By now dark had settled in and counting points by flashlight was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neck , but the rest of his body was skin and bones . The rut had taken its toll .

The buck was brought to taxidermist Jay Belcher of Quitman , Miss. , who later weighted the antlers at 13 1/2 pounds . The deer was measured for Boone and Crockett , and was determined to be a new state record of 255 6/8 points . Some time later , Fulton had the head measured for the Buckmasters Record Book . This new scoring method is a " full credit " system-there are no deductions or inside spread measurement . Russell Thornberry , editor of Buckmasters magazine , measured the deer himself . He came up with a score of over 310 . With such a disparity between the scores , Thornberry decided to call me . He knew that I had measured Milo Hanson 's world-record typical whitetail from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as James McMurray 's giant non-typical from Louisiana ( 281 6/8 points ) . Thornberry also knew that I had been a panel measurer for B &C; in 1995 . After many weeks and dozens of phone calls between me , Thornberry , Fulton and B &C; headquarters , arrangements were finally made to meet at the Bass Pro Wildlife Museum in Springfield , Mo. , where I was scheduled to help remeasure a collection of 75 top whitetails from all over North America for inclusion in the new B &C; record book . It was agreed that I would also remeasure the Fulton deer 's one-of-a-kind rack , and that the score would be unofficial . I would be assisted by Pope and Young measurer Ken Witt from Fort Worth , Tex . After Witt and I saw the complicated rack in person , we spent more than an hour and a half planning how to measure it . Almost seven hours later we finished-and believe me , we were physically drained . Our score : 329 6/8 B &C; points . We knew that , if accepted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a deer taken by a hunter , and only about four inches shy of the current world-record deer , which was found dead in Missouri in 1981 . I can say without a doubt that the Fulton head is probably the most complicated head ever measured , and that includes the famous " Hole in the Horn " buck ( 328 2/8 B &C; points ) that was found dead in Ohio back in 1940 . There are aspects of the Fulton buck 's rack that are simply not covered in the B &C; scorer 's manual . // B &C; ALL-TIME NON-TYPICAL WHITETAIL RECORDS // The Fulton Buck 20 3/8 inches ; and the longest point is 9 4/8 inches . It has double drop tines and is very well balanced , with 23 points on the right side and 25 on the left . The largest circumference is 12 1/2 inches . Each beam has a crown of points with all kinds of crevices and webbing . The points just seem to spring from the top of the beams in all directions . Having measured the rack , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a class by itself . The Fulton buck will be back at B &C; headquarters for the next panel measuring session , to be held in Spring 1998 . Until then , its final score and ranking remain unofficial . Up to now the highest-scoring whitetail taken by a hunter was a deer shot by Jeff Benson way back in 1892 . It scored 286 B &C; and had 49 scoreable points . After allowing for normal shrinkage and different interpretations of some of the scoring criteria , the Fulton head still has a good chance of being the highest-scoring whitetail buck ever taken by a hunter .
