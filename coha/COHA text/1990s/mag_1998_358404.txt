The center of attention in Art , you wo n't be surprised to learn , is a work of art : a big , plain , all-white painting that Serge , a well-to-do doctor , has bought for 200,000 francs . His friend Marc , who fancies himself an art buff but hates the modern stuff , is appalled at the purchase and tells him so . Each of them tries to enlist the support of a third friend , Yvan , who has other things on his mind , mainly his approaching wedding . In the brief 90 minutes that French author Yasmina Reza 's play takes to unfold , the three will debate modern art , lash out at each other with insults they will later regret , and generally explore the nature of their shaky friendship . <P> Art comes to the U.S. after much success in Europe and London , where it won an Olivier Award for Best Comedy of 1996 and provided a vehicle for such fine actors as Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay . It has been eagerly awaited by Broadway : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the buzz , a straight play with a chance of becoming a hot ticket . The U.S. cast boasts at least one marquee name  --  Alan Alda , who plays Marc with a few too many sitcom inflections  --  along with two solid co-stars , Victor Garber and Alfred Molina . Director Matthew Warchus ' sleek , mod production ( a white set dominated by three chairs and a coffee table ) is essentially the same as the one still drawing nearly full houses in London . <P> Unfortunately , Art is an overrated trifle : one of those small , schematic finger exercises that seem to win critical praise in direct proportion to their lack of ambition . The characters are all too easy to parse : Serge is a modernist but really a dilettante ; Marc , a classicist who 's a snob underneath ; Yvan , an art-naif who goes whichever way the wind blows . The audience has little investment in the clash between them because their friendship seems implausible from the get-go : there 's no explanation of how or why they became friends , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if Art worked as a Shavian battle of wit and ideas , but mostly it 's just three guys needling each other about everything from Serge 's haughty use of the term " the artist " to the way Marc 's wife contemptuously waves away cigarette smoke . <P> The link between art and friendship could actually be a fruitful subject for a play . How many of us have felt a pang of betrayal when a close friend or loved one has failed to share our enthusiasm for a favorite movie or novel ? But the issue is blunted here by the fact that the painting is treated as a joke from the start  --  and a dated one at that . It 's the old wheeze about how abstract art appeals only to pretentious critics ( and suckers like Serge ) , while ordinary folks see the emperor 's new clothes . <P> Yet Art may prove that the joke is n't so outdated after all . The play , in fact , is much like the painting onstage . It 's slickly rendered ; it 's got the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long enough , you can imagine all sorts of shadings and hidden lines . But take a deep breath and step back , and it 's just an empty canvas . <P>  --  By Richard Zoglin
