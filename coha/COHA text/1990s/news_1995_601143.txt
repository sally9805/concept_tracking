<p> Fifty years ago this month , Bob Dole 's world collapsed . <p> His right shoulder was destroyed in a mortar barrage in the Italian mountains during World War II , his dream of becoming a doctor shattered . <p> " When he came back from the war , it shook a lot of people up , " says his sister Norma Jean Steele . " He could n't do anything for himself . It was up to us to feed him . But he just did n't give up . " <p> No , Bob Dole does n't give up  --  his friends and foes say it over and over again . <p> Not when he spent 39 months in and out of hospitals , returning to this prairie town to recuperate from the wound that also cost him a kidney . <p> Not after a bruising defeat as Gerald Ford 's running mate . Nor when he twice failed to win the Republican presidential nomination . <p> And not when prostate cancer was discovered , and treated , three years ago . <p> On Monday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the goal that has eluded him for two decades , announcing a third try for the Republican presidential nomination . <p> At 71 , it is his last chance . It may also be his best . <p> In a crowded field of Republican hopefuls , he has advantages no one else can claim . <p> He 's the majority leader of the U.S. Senate at a time when Republicans run Congress . He 's also the undisputed GOP front-runner  --  recent polls show him 30 points in front of his nearest rival , Sen. Phil Gramm , R-Texas . <p> He 's got a campaign organization that 's learned from the failures of past presidential bids in 1980 and 1988 . <p> And as Senate leader , he 's got instant access to TV , fund-raising and a free platform in Congress to outline his views and attack President Clinton . <p> But no one has been elected president from the Senate since John F. Kennedy . Analysts wonder whether his biting style will get him in trouble again . And mindful of how far and how fast he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for granted . <p> " I wish the election were tomorrow , " he said recently . " I must say , it feels different out there than it did in 1987 and 1988 . So , you know , we just hope we can sustain it . " <p> It will be hard to sustain his advantage , warns Bill Lacy , a top campaign aide . " There is a tendency to ride the surf when you are ahead , " he says . " It 's a tremendous mistake . " <p> Democratic pollster Geoffrey Garin says Dole " is on the easy part of his political journey today . The front-runner is often a dangerous place to be . You have everybody putting targets on your back . " <p> Dole knows that , too . He is working hard to avoid the mistakes of his past . <p> In 1976 , as Gerald Ford 's vice presidential running mate , he was known as a hatchet man for calling the conflicts of the 20th century " Democratic wars . " <p> In 1988 , Dole seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " lying about my record . " <p> Former senator William Saxbe , a Republican from Ohio , once said Dole was so mean he " could n't sell beer on a troopship . " But these days , Dole is trying to be " Mr. Nice Guy . " <p> Dole says he 's learned to be " calm , serene , whatever you want to call it . . . I am more relaxed . I 'm sort of the warm , fuzzy , reasonable Bob Dole . " <p> But right now his biggest problem is sharpening his position on taxes and other fiscal issues . Both liberals and conservatives have attacked Dole in the past , because while he often balked at increasing spending for social programs , he also blocked " trickle-down " conservatives who claimed tax cuts would stimulate the economy . <p> In the 1980s , he battled with conservatives over his repeated support for tax increases as part of overall deficit reduction . At that time , Rep. Newt Gingrich , R-Ga. , called him " tax collector for the welfare state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'll be 73 , the oldest man to take the office  --  Dole is the picture of health . Pronounced recovered from prostate cancer , he is tanned and appears fit from hours on a treadmill . <p> Former vice president Dan Quayle once said " that on his day off , Dole goes to a fund-raiser . " <p> Dole recently suggested he 'd only serve one term , but later backed away from that pledge . <p> His family was the stuff of presidential biographies : His father ran a grain elevator , his mother sold sewing machines door-to-door . They moved to the basement of their home during the Depression , and rented out the first floor to avoid foreclosure . <p> His two sisters remember how Dole once shaved the family dog , hoping to sell the fur . <p> Growing up , Dole worked as a soda jerk , a janitor and sold milk to help his struggling family make ends meet . <p> He 'd only had two years at the University of Kansas when he joined the Army . When he returned on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their home not far from Main Street to give Dole space to recuperate . <p> Today , when he comes home to visit , Dole stays in the modest brick ranch house in the same room . It has a brass bed and on the bureau are three athletic letters he won in high school . <p> " He could stay in a motel , " says his older sister , Gloria Nelson . " But he draws a lot of strength from this house . It rejuvenates him . " <p> After the war , he was sent to a hospital in Michigan for rehabilitation . There he met Phyllis Holden , an occupational therapist , and married her in 1948 . <p> They returned to Russell , where he began a political career as county attorney , then went to Congress in 1961 and on to the Senate in 1968 . But Dole says he and his wife grew apart because of his career . <p> Divorced in 1972 after 24 years of marriage , she now lives in Topeka , Kan. , and declines to talk about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a Washington lobbyist . <p> These days everything Dole says and does is under the microscope . That may be why his wife , Elizabeth Hanford Dole , whom he married in 1975 , will be taking periodic leaves of absences from her job as president of the American Red Cross to help him campaign . <p> She says her husband " would do everything in his power to really lead America back to a place in the sun . He knows the way . " <p> Dole jokes he 's already made one pledge concerning his wife in his bid for the presidency : " If I 'm elected , Elizabeth will not be in charge of health-care policy . " <p> Dole has worked hard to win support of the party 's olderestablishment . But his biggest political problem will likely be winning the support of his party 's young conservatives . <p> Gramm , a choice of many conservatives , has suggested the Dole-run Senate might become the " black hole " ' for the GOP Contract with America . <p> That challenge has forced Dole to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right on affirmative action , an issue he once supported but now wants to overturn ; calling for repeal of the assault weapon ban ; and criticizing President Clinton at every turn on domestic and foreign policy . <p> Still , the presidential sweepstakes are nearly a year away , a year in which missteps and Senate frays could hurt him . <p> Dole is betting that wo n't happen . <p> " I would hope a voter would vote for me because I 've had experience , " says the man who has spent nearly half his life in Congress . <p> " I 'm a conservative , not right-wing , and have been consistently for a long time .
