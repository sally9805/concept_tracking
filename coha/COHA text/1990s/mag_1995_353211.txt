PAUL JERNBERG , A 71-YEAR-OLD mortgage banker from Chicago , walked into his doctor 's office a healthy , happy man . A short while later , he left with a sense of dread . Although Jernberg felt fine , a sophisticated protein test indicated that he might have prostate cancer . A subsequent biopsy was inconclusive , but a second one disclosed that he indeed had the beginnings of a tumor . " Of course , we 'll operate next week , " the physician told him . Not so fast , Jernberg thought . He feared the possible side effects of prostate surgery , including incontinence and even impotence . After consulting another doctor , who explained that many prostate cancers grow extremely slowly , Jernberg decided not to have the operation . " Maybe I wo n't live for 20 more years , " he observes . " But for me it was the right choice . " <P> Not that long ago , doctors and patients viewed medical tests the same way military officers think about radar . By providing an early warning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critical window for averting disaster . Just because a little information is good , however , does not necessarily mean that more information is better . Physicians are starting to have at their disposal a whole new panoply of advanced tests that provide more detail about what is going on inside the human body-often down to the molecular level  --  than ever before possible . Yet as Jernberg discovered , such tests can warn of dangers that are so far off , they may not be worth worrying about . Knowing too much , it turns out , may prove just as harmful to your health as knowing too little . <P> Examples of overaggressive treatment based on test results abound in fields ranging from cardiology to back surgery . But what has brought this issue to the fore is the extraordinary pace of genetic research . In the past few months , scientists have developed experimental tests for several cancer-causing genes that were discovered only last year  --  including one called BCRA1 , which , if mutated , can trigger breast tumors . Tests for newly identified genes that cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Trouble is , the tests have been developed so rapidly that not even their creators understand exactly how much faith to put in them . Preliminary studies suggest , for example , that testing positive for the mutated BCRA1 gene does not necessarily doom a woman to breast cancer . At least 15% of the women who carry the gene will never develop the disease . Yet scientists still do not know how to tell which women fall into that category . Nor does testing negative mean that a woman can stop worrying . The BCRA1 gene appears to play a role in only 5% of the 182,000 breast cancers that develop each year . So being free of an altered BCRA1 hardly means a woman will be free of breast cancer .
