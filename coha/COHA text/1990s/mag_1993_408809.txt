Is n't it weird that an event connected with a brand name , Marlboro Friday , would cause such generic panic down on Wall Street and up on Madison Avenue ? Since that April day when Philip Morris drew down the price of Marlboros 40 cents a pack , 25 of the top makers of brands , from shampoo to spaghetti , have lost $47.5 billion in market value . And famous-name food stocks tracked by Prudential Securities are selling at a 22% discount to the S &P; industrials , their worst showing since the early 1980s . Welcome to the brutal new world of brands . " Think about businesses going under , " says consultant Anil Jagtiani , a partner at Market Corp . of America . " even blue-chip consumer companies are having to right-size . " Private-label makers , whose offerings look and taste more like the Real Thing every day but cost 15% to 40% less , are making life miserable for companies such as PepsiCo , Procter &; Gamble , and H.J. Heinz . Store brands have risen to 18% of supermarket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ juicy price premiums for famous-label goods are history . Brands are far from dead , but managers who believe that private-label sales will abate when the economy strengthens are kidding themselves . Says Phil Dusenberry , vice chairman of the ad agency BBDO Worldwide : " The brands that will succeed are the No. 1 and No. 2 in a category , plus a private label . Anything below that will get squeezed right off the shelf . It 's doomsday . " Winners will offer lower prices , better quality , continuos innovation , and/or high profits to retailers . Says Procter &; Gamble CEO Edwin Artza : " We 're not banking on things getting better with time . We 're banking on us getting better . " Talk about blue-chip outfits under pressure . P &G,; the largest U.S. advertiser , cut prices of Pampers and Luvs three times in a year in a battle for babies ' bottoms with Paragon Trade Brands , which sells store-label diapers . You might even call the blustery , hard-charging Artzt the " Terminator " for the way he 's axing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orange juice business last year and recently liquidate Solo laundry detergent and White Cloud toilet paper . " Do n't use that term , " says Artzt , 63 , about the Schwarzeneggerian tag . Okay , mercy killer . Since handhearted retailers are yanking slow-selling items from store shelves , Artzt is opting to lose his own losers by expunging 25% of P &G's; myriad shapes and sizes of products . He also just announced plans to close 20% of P &G's; factories and cut 13,000 jobs , 12% of the total . The CEO 's aim : Generate $500 million in after-tax savings over three years . Coming up with a lower-cost way of operating is crucial because under his controversial " value pricing " program , Artzt is reducing list prices in all of P &G's; businesses . He believes that brands will win loyal consumers in this Darwinian decade by selling at consistently low prices , not high one day and on sale the next , as most marketers operate . " We 're trying to get more efficient and profitable , " he says . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A rare place where the view of brands is bright is the 39th floor of Boston 's Prudential Tower , world headquarters of Gillette . To paraphrase an ad slogan  --  from BBDO  --  you might say that Gillette is " the best a brand can get . " Helped by Sensor , a cutting-edge product for sure , the company has captured 65% of blade and razor sales in the U.S. and an even greater percentage in Europe and Latin America . Pricing is good . Private-label competition is almost nonexistent , except in disposables . Profits last year reached $513.4 million on revenues of $5.2 billion , a margin substantially higher than most packaged-goods makers . Such Wall Street analysts as Andrew Shore of Paine Webber say that Sensor Excel , a new razor set to roll across Europe this fall and the U.S. in 1994 , will keep earnings rising a steady 16% annually . Gillette 's brand-building story illustrates how a marketer can stave off lowball competition . the company 's secret ? Gillette never gouge consumers a price . It makes a demonstrably superior product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to copy . CEO Alfred Zeien , 63 , says he lives by a firm rule : Increase spending in " growth drivers "  --  R &D,; plant and equipment , and advertising  --  at last as fast as revenues go up . He also forbids any of his divisions to manufacture private-label products . While many other packaged-goods companies  --  Ralston Purina , Heinz , Nestle ' 3M , and every major U.S. cigarette maker  --  churn out store brands , often at subpar profit margins , Gillette 's Zeien says . " It 's a sign of weakness . " The mere notion of joining the private-label parade sends Gillette 's most gung ho vice president , blade and razor honcho Brian McFarland , railing : " If any manager did that , he should be shot . " Zeien , a chatty 25-year company man who ran international operations and R &D; before he became CEO in 1991 , describes his market philosophy this way : " We do n't sell products . We capture customers . " This idea sounds trite perhaps , but it really does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a customer " means selling a razor , preferably the high-end Sensor , to a consumers who must eventually refill it with Sensor blades . Ah , those blades . In North America and Europe they return profits  --  operating margins  --  at least 40% of revenues . The blade and razor business generates one-third of corporate revenues but two-thirds of profits . Gillette certainly would be plagued by low-priced store brands today if the company had not divested product liens  --  Cricket lighter in 1986 , for example  --  that could not be differentiated and command premium prices . " A flame is a flame is a flame , " says Zeien . Gillette 's pantry now includes Braun small appliances , Oral-B toothbrushes , and Paper Mate , Parker , and Watermen pens  --  all items that can earn an edge via proprietary design . The consequences of falling into the commodity trap are harsh , as Gillette once learned . When Bic , the French pen company , was vying to convert America to disposable razors , Gillette management during the mid-Eighties reached by cutting prices and devoting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Earnings fell . the trademark tarnished . Corporate raiders raided . And Gillette paid mightily for its freedom . Zeien banded with a handful of senior managers to argue that the commoditization trend was reversible . While continuing to sell disposables , they yanked the product 's TV ads and set upon a mission to get consumers to pay for a better shave . Sensor , launched in 1990 , brought Gillette back . Sales this year will exceed $500 million worldwide . and in the U.S. Sensor outsells rival Tracer , made by the Schick division of Warner-Lambert , ten to one . Sensor seems to be just a fancy-fangled $3.49 device with twin blades mounted on tiny springs , but it is more high tech in certain ways than a computer . No one can clone it . Reason is , Gillette designs and builds all its own manufacturing equipment , and that is exceptionally complicated gear . Schick won the rights to the Sensor patent , but analysts say that he company lacks the laser-welding machines that would be needed to make a Sensor knockoff . The next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It has five rubbery strips in front of the blade that stretch the skin to make shaving smoother and more comfortable . for that , you pay a retail price 15% to 20% higher than that of the original Sensor . The company wo n't even nick itself as Philip Morris did , says Bershire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett , who owns 11% of Gillette , worth $1.2 billion . Buffett 's reasoning is n't complicated : The typical American man buys 30 blades per year . If he sues Sensor , that 's 70 cents per blade , or $21 annually . A thrifty shopper could buy 30 generic blades for $9 . But , Buffett says , " that 's a saving of $12 for a 365-day experience , and I do n't think that proposition is going to appeal to most shavers . " Cigarette sellers have been much less protected , Buffett explains , because the average smoker buys ten packs weekly . Before price cutting began in the spring , the consumer spent $20 a week if he puffed Marlboro , Winston , or any other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ switching , a smoker could save about $500 annually . Says Buffett : " Your premium brand had better be delivering something special or it 's not going to get the business. : Consumers have done such analysis forever , so why now are they leaving famous labels ? National-brand quality used to be significantly superior . In all but commodity categoriesmilk , paper plates , plastic bags  --  shoppers lured to cheap store brands during touch economic times trades up again when they got flush . Now , says Wal-Mart stores CEO David Glass , " things are really changing . There 's a tremendous amount of quality in private label . " Retailers love store brands because they generate higher profit markers . Shoppers are urged to by them with colorful " compare and save " stickers on the shelves . Still , says Glass , " if we had our way , we 'd sell only national brands . " He complains that national suppliers raised prices too far too fast . " We were the ones consumers beat on because they though we were n't delivering good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changing dynamics of private label are catching the brand giants off guard . Look at P &G's; diapers , its largest and most profitable business . Artzt says that in most product liens , P &G; begins to lose market share when its prices are 30% to 50% above store brands . Last year , Artzt says , " we learned by surprise " that the premium had grown too wide , to about 35% . By vastly improving its diaper quality to near parity with P &G,; Paragon has persuaded chains such as Wal-Mart , Toys " R " Us , Kroger , and Food Lion to stock up . Since the typical diaper-buying mom spends a lot  --  $500 or so in a year  --  for her purchases , she liked the store brands selling for under $8 a 40-pack. even the pull of P &G's; advertising could n't keep its market share from sinking ten points , to 39% , by early 1993 . In a $4.4 billion market , the cost  --  you got it  --  $400 million in retail sales . Artzt reflects : " Brand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ layers and a core . the core is the user who will stick with you until the very end . " IN diapers , he says , " we lost the outer layer of our users . " By dropping list price 17% on Pampers and 28% on Luvs , Procter claims to have recovered more than three share points . Paragon says it gave back only one point . The battle is n't over . P &G; is about to launch a new , thin Pampers nationally . And the company will cut prices another 5% , predicts Paragon CEO Bobby Abraham , 51 , a native of India who picked up his MBA at Stanford and spent most of his career at Weyerhaeuser . The paper giant spun Paragon off in January . Paragon soaked up sales of $485 million last year , and it will respond , he says : " We 're simply planning to reduce our cost further . " While P &G; fends off Paragon , Coke and Pepsi contend with Cott , a 40-year-old Toronto company that used to sell branded cola ( " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success . Then in 1991 , Gerald Pence , the CEO and some of the founder , struck a 20-year exclusive deal with Royal Crown  --  perennial also-ran  --  to buy its concentrate , which gets mixed with fizzy water to make cola . The private-label pop that Cott now sells throughout North America is not exactly RC ( " It 's sweeter than Coke , with more cola flavor than Pepsi , " says Pencer ) , but it tastes like RC . You 're a Safeway shopper ? Cott cola there is called Safeway Select . " It 's " President 's Choice " at New York 's D'Agostino and Chicago 's Jewel Food Stores , " Master Choice " at A &P.; Cott , which mixes most of its U.S. drinks is underuse RC and Dr Pepper/Seven-Up bottling plants , has signed up more than 45 major U.S. retailer . It now controls about 1% of the U.S. soft drink market at wholesale  --  but this is a $30 billion industry . In two years Cott 's sales have quintupled to $261 million , and net income rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sells for $26 a share , up fivefold in a year . Wake up , Atlanta . Pepsi too . Following Marlboro Friday , Coca-Cola CEO Roberto Goizueta insisted to wall street in a hastily called meeting of analysts that private labels do not pose a significant competitive threat in soft drinks , particularly since heavy discounting has kept retail prices flat for a decade . The top pops face a real problems , though : The cola wars got so crazy that retailers , selling mostly on promotion , complain that they see little if any profit . So Coke and Pepsi sales armies have been blitzing supermarkets with studies and spiels intend to block Cott . Pepsi claims , among other things , that its purchases are a more profitable lot because they spend $46 per supermarket visit , while buyers of cheaper private-label soda spend a scant $32 . Coca-Cola 's top operating officer for North America , M. Douglas Ivester , argues that Cott 's store brands constitute " a traditional privet label in new clothes . " Coke , he says , delivers and stocks its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warehouses . " Considering this , a store 's profit margins are negative for private label and positive for us , " he says . The trouble , adds Ivester with no glint of self-blame , is that " most retailers have never had a good understanding of what their costs really are . " Wal-Mart understands . Even so , during the May  --  September guzzling season this year , the largest U.S. retailer agreed to carry Coke nationally in its new soft drink sections beside Sam 's American Choice cola , which comes from Cott . Pepsi gets stocked somewhere in the store only if a local Wal-Mart manager decides its ' the right one for his shoppers , baby . Uh-huh . Most Wal-Marts are carrying Pepsi , but the brand 's owners are nervously trying to consummate a national deal . Some fun this summer at Pepsi : syringes . Now this . At Coca-Cola , Ivester is cagey about what clinched the Wal-Mart agreement . He acknowledged that Coke has been investing in information systems for its bottlers . Wal-Mart , which likes to buy centrally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uneven pricing and service from Coke 's and Pepsi 's fragmented bottling networks . Coke 's higher-tech connection should ease some of the frustration . The outlook from the North : Cott 's Pencer says he aims to slurp up 5% of the U.S. soft drink market and $1.5 billion in sales in two years , mainly by stealing business from regional drinks and weak private labels . Pencer 's not perfect : A financial services outfit that he controlled took a tumble with junk bonds in the post crash Eighties . He 's a quirky , low-cost operator : He furnished Cott 's boardroom with old , pink-stripped chairs and a dining room table from home . But Pencer , 48 , gets high markets for surrounding himself with smart managers , including some 20 ex-Pepsi Canadians . He recently coordinate a cunning deal that will help his company be a long-term player . Cott now owns the Watt Group , a Toronto firm that designed most of its cans . The lure is founder Don watt . He 's the packaging innovator behind Loblaw , a Canadian supermarket chain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Watt is also favorite of the Wal-Mart people . he has helped design Wal-Mart Stores and created most of its private-label packaging . The Canadian crew , Pencer and Watt , pitch Cott to U.S. supermarket bosses , who hear something like this : " Buy our drinks and we can help you improve your entire private-label business , much like we helped Wal-Mart . " At which point the retailer salivates . David Glass laughs at this scenario , declaring with typical down-home depreciation : " IF everybody knew the problems we face every day , they may not want to be like us . " Right , David . To the traditional-brand owners , this is no laughing matter . The innovative crop of high-quality , low-cost producers is creating new store brands that threaten old established ones  --  and will keep pressuring them . National brands ' evolving role is to sit on stores shelves next to private labels . Shoppers compare and choose . No one can know how much bigger private label will become  --  25% of the market ? 30% ? As Glass says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the national-brand manufactures . If they can contain their costs and deliver a well-known brand at a competitive price , the consumers will buy them . " To brands that give sweeter treatment and better value to retailers and consumers go the spoils . For brands that have n't grasped this curial lesson , Terminators await . <p>
