<p> Tax relief , economic stimulus and health care are expected to dominate the second session of the 102nd Congress as the Senate and House reconvene over the next two days to deal with a crushing load of election-year promises and legislative leftovers from last year . <p> Tough economic times , combined with elections for the White House , the House and one-third of the Senate , virtually guarantee a contentious session  --  with few early clues to the likely outcome . <p> The Senate will go back to work today and is scheduled to vote on a move by Democrats to force consideration of their alternative to President Bush 's education bill . <p> The House will be back Wednesday . Although no legislative business will be scheduled for the House floor until after the president 's State of the Union address Jan. 28 and submission of his fiscal 1993 budget the next day , work is expected to begin promptly on a new extension of unemployment benefits . <p> With the collapse of the Soviet Union and continuing economic decline in the United States , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " including how big it should be and how the proceeds should be divided . <p> There is mounting pressure from both parties  --  even signs of a bidding war  --  for tax cuts , and many Democrats are talking about using some of the peace windfall for domestic needs . The jolts of the past year are forcing a reexamination of the 1990 budget agreement between the White House and Congress to accommodate tax cuts or domestic spending increases , although the $ 350 billion deficit projected for this year is giving many lawmakers pause about adding significantly to the red ink . <p> A raging debate over reform of the nation 's health-care system is anticipated , along with further arguments over crime control , energy , abortion , trade and campaign-finance reform . <p> Here are the major issues : <p> Budget , taxes and spending : Although congressional leaders say they want to keep overall fiscal restraint , pressure is strong to break down the " fire wall " that blocks any shift of resources between defense and domestic priorities . But there is no agreement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to allocate the windfall among priorities that include tax cuts , domestic spending increases and the deficit . <p> Last week , the administration focused on a five-year , $ 50 billion defense cut with the first-year saving going to deficit reduction . Democrats were setting their sights higher . Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell ( D-Maine ) proposed a $ 100 billion , five-year defense cutback that could be used for both tax cuts and domestic spending increases , with a slight increase in overall spending in the first year to help stimulate the economy . Some have proposed even larger spending shifts . <p> Even before members returned , Capitol Hill was awash in tax-cutting proposals , most focusing on middle-class tax relief , incentives for business investment and help for first-time home buyers . Bush is expected to renew his demand for a capital gains tax cut as well as tax cuts for families . Some Democrats will ask for higher taxes on the wealthy , especially if Bush wins on capital gains . <p> While anti-recession spending is limited by budget constraints , Congress is expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year and to consider some job-creating initiatives . <p> Defense : The Soviet collapse is expected to accelerate the squeeze on military spending that has been underway since the huge buildup of the early 1980s . But so many longterm commitments were made that quick saving is difficult to achieve . For the first time , whole weapon systems may be chopped , including the costly B-2 " stealth " bomber . <p> Health care : More than 30 health-care proposals were introduced last year , from bills to address specific problems such as medical malpractice insurance to proposals for total overhaul of the nation 's health-care delivery system . Bush is expected to support tax credits for health care in his State of the Union address , while most Democrats are lining up behind proposals that anticipate a more direct government role . Few believe a comprehensive health-care plan will be enacted this year , but some first steps are possible . <p> Education : The schools bill before the Senate puts Bush and Democrats on a collision course over conflicting school improvement and funding plans for private and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial aid to middle-income college students . <p> Trade : Relations with Japan are expected to dominate the initial trade debate as Democrats seek to exploit what they regard as Bush 's failed trade mission to Japan . But this is no guarantee that tough trade constraints will be enacted . <p> Pending before the Senate is veto-threatened legislation to tie most favored nation trading preferences for China to China 's performance on human rights , weapons control and trade . Congress could also consider a global trade pact under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and a free-trade agreement with Mexico . <p> Foreign policy : Congress will again confront the issue of $ 10 billion in loan guarantees to help Israel with settlement of Soviet Jews when stopgap foreign aid funding runs out March 31 . The Senate will consider ratification of the U.S.-Soviet Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty . Relations with the former Soviet republics , including more aid , will be a major concern for Congress as a whole . <p> Financial institutions : Overhaul of the nation 's banking laws , which was stymied last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breakthrough is considered unlikely this year . Another installment of the huge savings and loan bailout will also come due . <p> Environment : The environmental agenda includes legislation to protect California deserts , renew protections for endangered species , require federal agencies to comply with anti-pollution laws , give the Environmental Protection Agency Cabinet status and reauthorize clean-water laws . <p> Energy : Major energy legislation , prompted in part by the Persian Gulf War , ran into insurmountable hurdles in the Senate last year and may be redrafted to avoid some of the stumbling blocks , such as opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling . Also hanging over from last year is legislation to force automakers to improve the fuel efficiency of their cars . <p> Crime : A major anti-crime bill , including restoration of the death penalty for more than 50 federal crimes and tightening of rules involving death-row appeals and exclusion of tainted evidence from trials , stalled last year in a partisan cross-fire in the Senate . With crime expected to be a big issue in this fall 's elections , new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reform : Both houses passed legislation to overhaul their much-criticized campaign-finance laws , including provisions aimed at enforcing spending limits on candidates . A House-Senate compromise is likely but Bush is expected to use his veto , which Republicans can sustain . <p> Family leave : Both houses have approved legislation requiring employers to give workers unpaid leave to care for newborn infants and ill family members and are expected to take final action this year . Bush has threatened a veto and appears to have the votes to sustain it . <p> Abortion : Abortion-rights forces are expected to push again for several bills to relax existing abortion curbs , including one to repeal the administration 's ban on abortion counseling at federally funded clinics . <p> Ethics : The Senate ethics committee must decide whether to embark on a formal investigation of allegations that Sen. Mark O. Hatfield ( R-Ore. ) accepted gifts from friends with an interest in legislation before the Senate . In the House , the ethics committee is examining records of the now-closed House bank to find any big offenders among the members who bounced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to re-regulate cable television , prohibit employers from permanently replacing strikers , overhaul job-training programs and ease voter-registration procedures .
