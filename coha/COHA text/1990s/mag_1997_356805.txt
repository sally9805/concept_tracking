In the article I wrote for TIME last year after my victorious match against IBM 's Deep Blue supercomputer in Philadelphia , I expressed my surprise and amazement at seeing a new kind of intelligence . I referred to Game 1 , in which the computer 's decision to sacrifice a pawn , based strictly on the machine 's calculations , coincided with what a human would have done using human logic . Thus I stepped into a discussion of whether artificial intelligence has to be an exact copy of human thinking procedures or whether we should judge intelligence by the end result . I viewed the match with an improved version of Deep Blue as an opportunity to study this further  --  and of course to win a competitive event . <P> Unfortunately , I based my preparation for this match , played two weeks ago in New York City , on the conventional wisdom of what would constitute good anticomputer strategy . Conventional wisdom is  --  or was until the end of this match  --  to avoid early confrontations , play a slow game , try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , when the climax comes , not lose your concentration and not make any tactical mistakes . <P> It was my bad luck that this strategy worked perfectly in Game 1  --  but never again for the rest of the match . By the middle of the match , I found myself unprepared for what turned out to be a totally new kind of intellectual challenge . <P> The decisive game of the match was Game 2 , which left a scar in my memory and prevented me from achieving my usual total concentration in the following games . In Deep Blue 's Game 2 we saw something that went well beyond our wildest expectations of how well a computer would be able to foresee the long-term positional consequences of its decisions . The machine refused to move to a position that had a decisive short-term advantage  --  showing a very human sense of danger . I think this moment could mark a revolution in computer science that could earn IBM and the Deep Blue team a Nobel Prize . Even today , weeks later , no other chess-playing program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequences of Deep Blue 's position . <P> Also , Game 2 had a very unfortunate finish . Deep Blue held a strategically winning position , but it made a tactical blunder that , if I had sacrificed a piece , could have given me a miraculous escape . But I trusted the machine 's calculations , thinking it would not miss such a continuation , and resigned instead . <P> Game 2 created an enigma for me that I never solved and from which I never recovered . I would like the IBM team to start disclosing the secrets of how they achieved this unthinkable success in chess programming . They claim they developed software that enabled them to change the style of the program in mid-match and the evaluation ability of the machine from game to game . This also is revolutionary , because any change , any tweak in the computer normally needs weeks of testing to avoid potential bugs . <P> I discovered that I was playing a very flexible , quickly changing opponent with an ability to avoid any mistakes in long-term calculations . My opponent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on around it , and it made almost none of the typical computer-chess errors .
