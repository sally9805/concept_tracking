<p> I guess it 's possible that Oxford 's brightest literary eras are all dead and gone . Think of Chaucer , Donne , Johnson , Shelley , Arnold , Wilde  --  all dead . Or think of more recent figures such as Thomas Hardy of the dark and demythologizing " Jude the Obscure , " or Evelyn Waugh and " Brideshead Revisited , " or J.R.R. Tolkien and his otherwordly fantasies . Like many of the other authors of more than 500 novels that have dealt somehow with Oxford , these too have vanished . <p> And yet it 's amazing how many good writers live here even now . Unlike lots of other old university towns , Oxford , with a population of about 125,000 , still attracts novelists and poets and biographers who do n't work at the university . <p> Some are quite elderly and no longer receiving strangers  --  such as Iris Murdoch , who suffers from Alzheimer 's . But they 're part of the place , even so . Some freeze a bit when confronted by a fan  --  as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I recognized his face from a photograph and shook his hand and said hello . ( He was wearing a lime-green woolen sweater and wore steely round spectacles and a certain fashionable gauntness . ) <p> Some put a stranger off  --  as the mystery writer Colin Dexter did when I phoned and invited him to lunch , and he replied grumpily that he found food a bore . But even Dexter agreed to meet a few weeks later ; and even the steely McEwan was friendly over the phone . The point , though , is that they live here . And so do scads of other English writers , such as the poet James Fenton and the " historian of the present " Timothy Garton Ash and the travel writer Redmond O'Hanlon . <p> Still others keep popping up , meanwhile , such as the novelist Julian Barnes , who went to Oxford and who said in his novel " Flaubert 's Parrot " that there 'd been enough books about Oxford . I once saw him at the Oxford bookstore in Buckhead , and I saw him again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighborhood that Hardy made famous , as Dexter has again a century later ) . <p> The place is like that  --  sort of twisty and braided and intricate ( as the Oxford poet Gerard Manley Hopkins might have said ) . And in fact an excellent new book by John Dougill , " Oxford in English Literature , " points out that literary Oxonians are still so prominent in Britain that reviews of their books fill the pages of literary reviews that are likely to be edited by Oxonians and written by them too . " Indeed , " Dougill says , " charges have been made of an Oxford ' literary mafia ' with a stranglehold on the nation 's culture "  --  even now , a good century after the heyday of church , empire , Culture and the ruling class . <p> I would n't know if there 's a mafia or not . But I have noticed that the fine writer A.S . Byatt , who lives in Oxford , has included a story by her fellow-resident Ian McEwan in her new " Oxford Book of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shelves in time for Christmas not far from Byatt 's own new book of short stories , " Elementals . " And when I recently bought a paperback of the murder mystery " An Instance of the Fingerpost "  --  written by the Oxford novelist Iain Pears , and set in 17th-century Oxford  --  I noticed a blurb of praise on the novel 's cover by P.D . James , another successful mystery writer who happens to own a house just yards away from Pears ' house . <p> James was born here ( she went to Cambridge , by the way ) but most other modern Oxford writers moved here . Some came for family reasons ( marriage to an academic , for example , as Iris Murdoch is married to the English critic John Bayley ) but , whatever their motives , they tend to find the place congenial . <p> " I 'm here for sort of historical reasons , " McEwan told me after he won this year 's Booker Prize ( Britain 's most prestigious literary award ) for his novel " Amsterdam , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Waugh 's " Scoop . " McEwan has two teenage sons by a previous marriage in school here , although his present wife ( a journalist ) lives in London . ( Maybe I should n't have asked . ) <p> The schools are excellent , he said ; that 's one reason writers like to keep their families here . " And Oxford is a marvelous place for teenagers , " McEwan added . " You can get around the whole place on a bike rather than the subways . " <p> So he figures he 'll stay here while the kids are in school . " And I think I 'll probably return one day to London . " <p> There was more . " I guess most of my friends who live in Oxford are writers , " McEwan said . He mentioned Fenton ( who was elected Oxford Professor of Poetry a couple of years ago after the poet Seamus Heaney 's five-year term expired ) and another poet , Craig Raine , and Ash , and others . <p> " It 's a good place to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Park Town , as " incredibly quiet . " It 's also within walking distance of green open country to the east , where a stretch of never-farmed bottomland along the River Cherwell has been preserved , and to the west , where cattle and horses graze in Port Meadow along the narrow River Thames . " So that 's a real delight , " said the writer whose books are rich with fateful scenes involving long walks . Contemplative walks are personally important to him ; in fact , they 're " central to writing . " <p> And of course the city 's glorious architecture is very " easy on the eye , " McEwan added ; and presumably the endless crowds of tourists have n't ruined it for him . One day I went to lunch at Gee 's , a pleasant pseudo-Victorian greenhouse on Banbury Road , with Felicity Bryan , a former journalist who claims to be the only literary agent in Oxford . Her reading of why so many writers live in Oxford sounded very much like McEwan 's : It is n't a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a nice place to live . ( Bryan herself lives in a beautiful former rectory in suburban Kidlington . ) She spoke of how French and German publishers like to visit Oxford ( which can be a very good thing for a writer 's foreign sales ) ; of the novelist Angela Huth , who wrote the book that became the movie " Land Girls " and who does n't like Oxford ( several feminists and many socialists have felt the same way : Oxford still retains more than a bit of the old , elite men 's club ) ; of Oxford historians and scientists and a cookbook author , Raymond Blanc , and a literary biographer named Lyndall Gordon , who just came out with a new book on Henry James . <p> And what does Bryan herself think of Oxford ? " I do n't think Oxford 's that wonderful , really . It 's a rather smug place , and a bit sleepy . " <p> Bryan showered me with names and phone numbers . And between those and the bookshops , between chance conversations and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he pondered the next weird paragraph of his great " Anatomy of Melancholy ? " ) , I soon felt overwhelmed , half drunk , out of my depth . Dozens of living writers lived just a few blocks away . And if bits and currents of literary Oxford 's past put me off ( such as its taste for fantasy and orthodox Christian theology and political reaction and social exclusivity ) , I kept hearing other things about Oxford writers that made me eager to read more Peter Levi , John Wain , Thomas Warton , Joyce Cary , Kingsley Amis  --  practically ad infinitum . <p> It was a relief , one foggy recent morning , to wake up and realize it was time to sit down in a popular nondescript pub , the Dew Drop Inn , in bourgeois Summertown , with the excellent mystery writer Colin Dexter . <p> Dexter 's novels about the beer-drinking , Wagner-loving Inspector Morse  --  who has redefined Oxford for millions around the world via a series of TV dramas starring John Thaw  --  do have their traditionally Oxonian features , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impatience with the modern world . There are also dons afoot , and floods of arcane information ( Dexter studied the classics at Cambridge , as the fictional Morse did at Oxford ) and crossword puzzles and other links with many crime novels spawned by Oxford in the decades since the 1920s . <p> But in other ways the Morse novels are realistic , current and occasionally crude . They deal with cops , jealousy , lust , drugs , fraud , murder , ugly buildings , tedious encounters  --  and more than a few classes and cultural backgrounds . They reflect the new ( literary ) Oxford of most other late-20th century writers around here , as well as the older more eccentric Oxford . <p> Dexter got to the pub at noon and sat down at the back of the big room with his first pint of bitter . He 's shorter than Thaw 's Morse , and not handsome , and he wore a scruffy blue denim shirt and cardigan , and he was certainly famous but he looked just like any other 68-year-old guy in a bar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where he wore a hearing aid . <p> Why do so many mystery writers live in Oxford , I asked . And not just Dexter ( whose novels and associated cultist paraphernalia fill entire displays in the local bookshops ) but also other writers , whose books cover nearby tables with mysteries by Pears , James , Antonia Fraser , Dorothy Sayers , Michael Dibdin , Edmund Crispin and others . Why ? <p> The same old reasons , he said ; the place is pleasant and literary and " overqualified . " But Dexter did n't really agree with my thesis . He said Oxford used to be full of best-selling crime writers such as Dick Francis and Michael Innes , " but they 've gone off to tax havens and so on . " Or they 've died . Michael Innes was the mystery-writing pseudonym of the distinguished literary historian J.I.M . Stewart , author of books on Joyce and Eliot as well as 20 serious novels and more than 50 mysteries . Dexter added that two former editors of a local weekly newspaper , The Oxford Times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to set crosswords for the Oxford Times , so that makes three of us from that paper alone . " <p> He 's an old-fashioned crime writer in the sense that he likes his books short . He was asked to review " An Instance of the Fingerpost , " but when he found out how long it was he declined . " I 'm a very slow reader . I mean a long massive book is all right if it 's Gibbon or Proust or someone . " <p> Is he writing another Morse ? <p> " I 've been bullied to write one more Morse book , and then I 'm finished . I 've had enough of Morse . " <p> Will he kill Morse off ? " Yeah , " Dexter said . " I think it 's about time that I did . " <p> He might write one TV play , but apart from that he feels his work is done . " I always promised myself I 'd write a book on Housman "  --  the succinct poet of " A Shropshire Lad " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to become a distinguished Latinist at Cambridge as well as a poet . But John Bayley wrote a book on Housman that Dexter said was " really the sort of thing I would have loved to have tried . " <p> He still reads Latin , and he spoke of Ovid . " The ' Amores ' are beautifully gentle . And so clever . Such a clever man Ovid was . " He called the translation of Ovid 's " Metamorphoses " by Ted Hughes " brilliant . " <p> For a plain-spoken man he sounded very generous in his comments on other writers , and he seemed to veer away from commenting on Oxford , which he said was " stuffed " with writers . But he kept reverting instead to his own , older tastes  --  to Aristotle and mystery writers and quirky scholars and public speakers in the House of Lords who might not be democrats ( he 's a Blair man himself ) but who still can speak with wonder and authority . <p> " I 'm a great admirer of the minor poets of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dowson and Flecker . Also Tennyson , Hardy , Kipling , Swinburne , Yeats , Arnold . There were later poets , he supposed  --  Auden , Spender and MacNeice in the ' 30s ( all at Oxford , he might have added )  --  but they did n't mean as much to Dexter . <p> The pub had filled up by now , and I said into his good ear that I 'd just read something by MacNeice and wanted to read more . Dexter stared out into the room , lively with young people from the nearby language schools on Banbury Road . I thought I must have bored him . But he was just remembering . And after a moment he began reciting at length from MacNeice 's eminently declaimable poem " Autumn Journal . " <p> Nobody in the pub seemed to notice , although I must say he declaimed very well . What a delightful man ! And what a pleasure it was to be listening to such a good and unpretentious Oxford writer recalling some poets he really liked . <p> Calming : Writer Ian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All Souls College , is " easy on the eye .
