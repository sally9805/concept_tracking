Investors looking for winning stocks would be smart to start with the shares of companies that spend heavily on research and development . After all , if top management thinks it 's worthwhile pouring money into a company 's future business , then maybe you should too . Of course , an executive 's decision to shower cash on research projects does n't guarantee success . " First you have to choose the right projects to pursue , " says analyst Kenneth R. Nover at A.G. Edwards in St. Louis . Nonetheless , many of the winning stocks in tomorrow 's growth industries will be firms that reinvest a large percentage of their sales . On average , U.S. companies spend less than 4% of their sales on R &D,; according to Standard &; Poor 's . Those in growth businesses such as computers , electronics , software , medical products and pharmaceuticals typically reinvest more than 5% of sales . The four firms below , however , put from 8% to 13% of their revenues into R &D; last year . Standard &; Poor 's gives above-average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analysts currently recommend them highly as well . The stocks are discussed in order of their potential market gains over the next 18 months . Microsoft ( ticker symbol : MSFT ; recently traded over the counter at $51.25 ; no yield ) . The world 's premier independent computer software company , Microsoft ( estimated 1994 revenues : $4.6 billion ) spends a hefty 13% of sales on R &D.; " The company has a history of seizing new ideas and then sticking with them , " says analyst David D. Rothschild at Piper Jaffray in Minneapolis . Currently the company dominates two multibillion-dollar markets : operating system software , such as Windows , 80% of which is sold directly to computer makers ; and applications software , such as Word for word processing and Excel for spreadsheets , which is mostly sold for office use or to individual computer owners at retail . Analysts are now excited by the company 's entry into the enormous home-software market , largely through CD-ROM , which can hold an entire encyclopedia on a single disk . A home-computer user looking up President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , can see a video clip of the former president making his stirring speech in Berlin . " CD-ROM could be a billion-dollar market by next year , " says analyst Stephen T. McClellan at the San Francisco office of Merrill Lynch . McClellan expects Microsoft 's earnings growth to accelerate from 17% this year to a 20%-plus annual rate over the next two or three years . And he believes the stock could climb 27% to $65 within 18 months . Pioneer Hi-Bred ( PHYB ; OTC , $32.50 ; 2.3% ) . After we recommended $1.5 billion Pioneer in September at $29.75 , the stock traded as high as $40.50 . Since then , the nation 's largest supplier of hybrid seed has given back most of its gains , offering investors a second shot at buying it on the cheap . In part , the stock 's pull-back reflects the overall market 's recent dip . However , it is also a response to comments that chairman Thomas Urban made in June , urging analysts to be cautious in their 1995 earnings projections for Pioneer . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bonnie Wittenburg at Dain Bosworth in Minneapolis . The reason Urban wanted to talk down earnings expectations , the analysts explain , is that some of the seed Pioneer will sell next year was grown in 1993 when costs were pushed up by the midwestern flood . That will squeeze ' 95 profit margins . Nonetheless , Pioneer , which spends 8% of its sales on R &D,; will continue to profit longer term from its successes as an innovator . " The company is breeding seeds to have higher yields , greater nutritional value and more resistance to disease and herbicides , " explains Richard G. Elam at Kemper Securities in Chicago . And Wittenburg adds : " That R &D; will pay off further down the road . " Elam thinks the stock could rise 23% to top $40 over the next 18 months . Perkin-Elmer ( PKN ; New York Stock Exchange , $30 ; 2.3% ) . A leading maker of instruments and sophisticated systems for the biotechnology , pharmaceutical and chemical industries , $1 billion Perkin-Elmer has seen its stock drop nearly 25% from its 1993 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The health-care-reform debate has crimped sales of some of the company 's products , says analyst John Ederer at the New York office of Hambrecht &; Quist . Further , European sales , which account for more than a third of Perkin-Elmer 's business , have been hit by weak economies in the region . Once the outlook for health care becomes clearer and European economies improve , Perkin-Elmer could rebound , analysts say , because of its sterling technology . The company spends 8% of sales developing products such as its gene sequencers and amplifiers , systems that sell for hundreds of thousands of dollars and allow companies to analyze and replicate genes and proteins . Analyst Maureen McGann at Merrill Lynch in New York City projects that Perkin-Elmer 's earnings could grow at a 22% compound annual rate over the next five years . And she figures that the stock could trade at 18 times the $2 earnings per share she estimates for the fiscal year ending June 30 , 1995 ; that would represent a 20% gain to $36 within the next 18 months . Pfizer ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pfizer has been the most innovative of the large drug companies , " says analyst John R. Borzilleri at Dean Witter in New York City . Small wonder  --  the $8.1 billion company spends a hefty 13% of sales on R &D.; " Over the past five years , the company has launched five major products that are still being rolled out around the world , " says Nover at A.G. Edwards . These five , which together could bring in $3.4 billion next year , include : Norvasc , used to treat congestive heart failure ; Zoloft for obsessive-compulsive disorder ; Diflucan , which treats AIDS-related fungal diseases ; Zithromax , an antibiotic ; and Cardura for enlarged prostate . " Over the next five years , nearly two-thirds of the company 's revenues will come from products that are already on the market , " says Borzilleri . In addition , analysts have high hopes for Pfizer 's Enable drug , which slows the progress of rheumatoid arthritis with fewer side effects than products in current use ; this potentially $500 million product is slated for launch by 1996 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will grow at a 14% compound annual rate through the late ' 90s , and he thinks the stock could rise 14% to $72 in 18 months . FINDING RICHES IN BUSINESS NICHES In this volatile stock market , small investors may be tempted to buy only the shares of giant companies . But sometimes firms with the steadiest profit gains are smaller corporations that dominate lucrative business niches . Here are two such companies that currently get high marks from analysts : Forschner Group ( symbol : FSNR ; OTC , $12.50 ; no yield ) . The exclusive marketer of Original Swiss Army knives in North America , Forschner 's multiblade pocketknives range in price from $9 to $140 for a model that includes a fish scaler . " The knife business is growing close to 10% a year , " says analyst James P. Hammel at Advest in Hartford . One reason : the Shelton , Conn. firm is steadily broadening the market for its pocketknives , which account for half its estimated 1994 sales of $125 million . For example , Forschner 's Signature series consists of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come in a full range of hot colors and include a ball-point pen rather than a toothpick , " explains Thomas Cunningham , who is Forschner ' chief financial officer . Even greater earnings growth has come from the company 's efforts to extend the high-quality image of its Swiss Army brand to other products . For example , Forschner hit it big with its Swiss Army watches , introduced in 1992 and currently priced from $75 to $500 . " In the beginning , they did n't expect to sell more than $10 million a year , but the watches will bring in $30 million in ' 94 , " says analyst Dennis Moran at A.G. Edwards in St. Louis . Overall , the analysts expect Forschner 's earnings to grow 15% to 20% annually over the next three years and think the stock could rise 44% to top $18 within the next 18 months . Juno Lighting ( JUNO ; OTC , $19.50 ; 1.5% ) . One of the top three U.S. makers of track and recessed lighting , Juno is projected to have sales of $125 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a $600 million market , " says analyst Elliott Schlang at Kidder Peabody in Cleveland . Juno provides lighting for new commercial construction , commercial remodeling and residential use . " Commercial clients include such firms as Disney , Florsheim and The Gap , " says analyst Kevin E. Silverman at Kemper Securities in Chicago . Juno 's growth will come chiefly from its existing business . " The company produces unique , innovative products such as recessed lights for sloping ceilings , " says analyst David Jarrett at Gerard Klauer Mattison in New York City . " Juno also makes 100% of its products in the U.S. , so it can ship them within 48 hours , " he adds . With an ongoing economic recovery boosting remodeling and new-home sales , the analysts project that Juno 's earnings can increase 14% to 15% a year . They add that the stock could gain 28% to $25 within 18 months . <p>
