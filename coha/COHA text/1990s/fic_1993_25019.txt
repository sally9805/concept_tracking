 | Tamborel slid aside the saba lattice and edged out . From under the shadow of that low stone entrance arch he eyed the knot of women by the garden gate . Eleyna was no gossip , yet there she 'd stood all morning , barring his flight with the older boys over the ripening grainfields and on to glory at the minnow brook . Something was up , and it was bad , Tamborel just knew it . Else why did his mother look so grim and why was her back so straight ? And why was he kept inside on such a fine day ? Had he done something wrong ? Tamborel rehearsed all that had been said and done that morning , from the moment he got up to the time Hwyllum , his pappa , left for the grain-  | fields . And then on till he was sent to wash his face . No , Eleyna had seemed happy with him . So what was it , then ? Tamborel raked his fingers through his tawny curls , thinking hard . As he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the saba lattice . He remembered now the hurried , hushed exchange , and yes , that was when she 'd told him to stay put . He inched his bare feet forward until the sunlight on the worn stone step dubbed his big toenail . Still his mother did not turn her head . To have gotten so far undetected ! There was no doubting now the direness of the occasion . The women were gazing up the street toward the village boundary , where the road began that led west to Pridicum , the neighboring village . Were they expecting someone ? Tamborel craned on tiptoe , but he was way too small to see over the garden wall . Above each woman , the modest clusters of their heynim , tiny golden chiming spheres , danced and swirled like sun-bugs with each nod and shake of the head . He tuned his ears toward the high , melodic tinkling and breathed out , his worry unraveling slightly under their influence , even though the harmonies were purely accidental . Only three folk in Fahwyll could alter their spheres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only three had enough mind-power to snag and hold more than a handful of heynim ; to create measured harmonies and put them to use . One was Yornwey  | the zjarn , who tuned her faleyn to heal a body 's ill . The others were Throm and Bennoc , who tuned their faleyn in the fields at sowing and harvest : Throm , to the soil to encourage the crops ; Bennoc , to the skies to bring fair weather . This trio held the biggest clusters in Fahwyll  --  almost two handfuls of heynim each . No others in the village could hold more than a half-dozen of the golden spheres , let alone control their chiming . Not even Tamborel 's own mamma and pappa , as he found when he was old enough to ask . " Sorry , but we 're not able , " Eleyna had answered , with a shake of her head that had set her little cluster a-bob and a-jingle . " How can you be sure ? " " To tune a faleyn you need greater power than ours . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Throm ? Is that why they 're so important , Mamma ? " " Aye . We depend on faleyn for our lives  --  as you well know , Tam'shu . " He did indeed . Were n't the measured chimes such a vital part of life that the very world was named for them ? Alyafaleyn , or Region of Harmonies . And were n't those who tuned them held in the highest esteem ? Tamborel longed to be grown up and holding his own cluster , doing important work alongside Yornwey , and Bennoc , and Throm . " Are they the greatest folk in the world ? " Eleyna had found this amusing , though he 'd been  | quite serious . " In Fahwyll , at any rate . But they say that folk in Minavar trail swarms the length of our front path . Think how their faleyn would sound , Tam'shu .... " Tamborel stole out from under the saba 's shadow , scuffing his toe in the dusty garden path , drawn irresistibly toward the front gate by conflicting desires : to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off to the minnow brook . He pictured the older boys , their feet in the cool , swift currents , their stone crocks steely with minnows by now . He sidled on toward the gate , and had almost reached it when at last Eleyna noticed him . Frowning , she waved him back . " Inside , Tam'shu . I said you 'll not go out today . " " But , Mamma , I want to be with Meynoc ! " Meynoc , biggest of all the village boys . Good-natured Meynoc , who always suffered his company when the other boys ordered him away . " Meynoc stays home , too , little one . Now go inside and be a good boy . " Tamborel retreated under the saba 's shadow . Meynoc was indoors also ? Hard to believe , but Eleyna always told the truth . During the last monsoons when he 'd been taken with the moldy fever , she 'd told him how truly bad it was , even after Hwyllum said that she should not . How Mistress Bider the herb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How they must call in Yornwey the  | zjarn . How Yornwey must tune her faleyn to his sickness , and how he must be a big boy , and bend his mind to help . Eleyna had frightened him , but , glad of the truth , he 'd tried hard , fixing his ear on Yornwey 's tinkling chimes . He 'd slept , and awakened with the fever down , and his lungs clear . A stray heyn floated past the saba , a tiny golden bubble almost within reach . A heyn still free , unsnagged , so long past the rains ? In the days following the hard monsoons , the clear skies sparkled with them  --  fresh new ones , Eleyna said , although she could n't say exactly where they came from , or why . Most were snagged over the city of Minavar . A few made it further east to Pridicum , the neighboring village . Of those , some very few , riding high , escaped to drift out Fahwyll-way . Had this one been tangled in a tree ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had shaken it loose again , or a bird had dislodged it , maybe . Tamborel grabbed for it then hastily clasped his hands behind his back . What a baby , reaching for it physically ! Embarrassed , he glanced to the women at the gate . To his relief , they had not noticed . The heyn had floated on , its tantalizing notes receding on the breeze . Tamborel tried to fix his mind on it , to will it to him the way the big folk did , but without success . Wistfully , he watched it go , curving in a high arc , then dancing away over the low , flat rooftops on the gentle winds . He sighed , wishing he were old enough to snag a heyn and bind it to his  | mind with firm and steady purpose . But at five , he had a long wait . Even Meynoc , nearly thirteen years come harvest time had shown no signs of snagging yet . As the dwindling sphere winked off into the blue , Tamborel 's attention pricked . Over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heynim , he now heard new tones : stronger than Yornwey 's , or Bennoc 's , or Throm 's , and deeper . In mounting excitement , he leaned out from under the saba 's shadow , straining to hear . A stranger was approaching , bringing harmonies from outside ! As the chimes drew nearer , the watching women exclaimed , then fell quiet . Tamborel craned on tiptoe , striving vainly to peer over the garden wall . Oh , if only he were taller .. . Tamborel ran to fetch a chair and climbed atop it . Now he could see all right , over the garden wall and along the street . Squeezing up his eyes against the noon glare , he made out two shapes stark against the Pridicum road . One was Meynoc 's father , Bombrul , who should be in the grainfields at this hour . Beside him strode a stocky man of middle size and height : nothing remarkable about him  --  except that above his head swarmed the biggest golden cluster that Tamborel had ever seen . More : in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeper notes that he had heard . As the man strode past with Bombrul , Tamborel tried to count those  | bigger spheres , but there were too many , more than he had fingers , at any rate . Bending to the heynim 's influence , he let go , remembering to breathe . Those larger spheres , Tamborel had never seen the like . No one in Fahwyll had such , not even Yornwey , or Bennoc , or Throm . Were the larger heynim more powerful than the little ones ? he wondered . Did they do things the little ones could not ? He longed to ask Eleyna these things , and also who the man was and why Meynoc 's father had brought him to Fahwyll , but he dared not , for fear that Eleyna would banish him back inside . The foreigner was past , and his golden heyn-cloud . The wondrous music faded in the distance . On a calculated risk , Tamborel scrambled down off the chair and ran to stand behind Eleyna , peering out . " So that 's Casinder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run all the way to Pridicum to be fetching him so quick . Looks fair beat , poor man . And so he would , not being our best runner . " The woman glanced to Eleyna . Everyone knew Hwyllum had the fastest legs and stoutest windpipe in the village . " Serve him right , " Mother Turner said . " He should 've sent Hwyllum . " " The zjarn does n't look the least bit winded , " observed Mistress Bewly . " The way they boast about that man in Pridicum . No one can be that good . Though he does trail a bigger cluster than Yornwey 's , must admit . "  | Mother Turner nodded . " Let 's hope it 's more powerful , too . Rufina wo n't see the day out , else . " Tamborel 's ears pricked . Rufina ? Meynoc 's mother , Bombrul 's wife . She was ill ? Is that why Bombrul had fetched Casinder ? Why Meynoc had not come out to play ? " Rufina must be very ill , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at the bad boy ! " she cried . " Go on in with you . There 's no more here to see . " " But , " wailed Tamborel , as his mother hustled him under the saba , pulling the lattice across , shutting them both inside . " Will Rufina die ? " Eleyna threw up her hands . " Hark at you ! " she scolded . " What gives you such an idea ! Did you not see Casinder just now ? Did you not see his great cluster ? He and Yornwey are going to tune their faleyn in augmentation so of course Rufina will be healed ! Here , come away from that lattice and help me clean these bimbleberries . I 've a pie to bake for tea ! " All afternoon , Tamborel longed to slip out to Meynoc 's house , to hear the two zjarns tuning their faleyn together , in augmentation as his mother had called it . But Eleyna had not only closed the saba lattice . She had also latched all the saraba shutters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned down , a dry breeze blew through the shutter slats . Men passed in the street , returning from the  | fields . His father came in , subdued and disinclined to speak . As Tamborel sat with his parents at supper , a neighbor called at their saba lattice . Tamborel jumped down to open it , but Eleyna barred his way . " Wait here , my lad , " she said , and went out . Presently she returned , looking grave . " Who was it ? " Tamborel burst out . Eleyna only shook her head , exchanging looks with Hwyllum . After supper , the two of them went to stand under the saba , and closed the lattice behind them . Tamborel watched them speaking with their heads close , watched their heynim intermingling as was the way with family folk . Though they spoke low and kept their faces turned from him , Tamborel 's keen ears caught enough . Rufina was no better . The two zjarns barely held her flame within its cup : if something were not done , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | Eleyna shooed him into bed . " You 've been a good boy , Tamborel . Now sleep , eh ? " She picked up the lamp and went to his bedroom arch . As she made to slide his lattice closed , Tamborel struggled up from the covers . " Mamma ! " Eleyna paused , her hand on the lattice catch . " Yes , Tam'shu ? " " Will Rufina die ? " Eleyna came back , concerned . " My goodness , I hope not . " " Is it the moldy fever ? " he asked , though he knew full well that it came only in the rainy season . His mother shook her head . " Then what ? "  | " She . .. has ... poisons in her blood . " " Poisons ! " Tamborel drew in his breath . " Did she eat something bad ? " Eleyna shook her head . " Do n't worry , Tam'shu . She has two zjarns working for her now , and that must be powerful harmony . " Hwyllum came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down yet ? " He advanced into the room . " What is going on , Mamma ? " " Nothing , Hwyllum , " Eleyna said . " Oh ? And what nothing is that , pray ? " Tamborel sank back onto his pillow . Trust Pappa to come in at this moment ! He 'd learn nothing further now . " Tamborel was asking me about Rufina , " Eleyna said . " Indeed . " Hwyllum folded his arms . " And so you fill a five-year-old with gory detail . Eleyna , he is much too young . " " Not too young to imagine the worst . He needs the truth  --  some of it , anyway . " Tamborel popped up again . " How could she get so sick so fast , Mamma ? " " She did n't , little one . It 's been coming on for days . Mistress Bider gave her remedies , but she still got worse . " " Hut Meynoc never said . And he was fishing every day . " " Meynoc did n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Children do n't know everything , not even big ones like Meynoc . " But now Rufina was so bad , they could n't hide it any more , thought Tamborel . He eyed his parents suspiciously . " What if Rufina does die ? " Eleyna and Hwyllum exchanged glances . " She wo n't . She ca n't , Tam'shu . She 's far too young and strong for death . Now down . We 've told you all we know , just about . " Just about ? Tamborel 's fear spiked . " If she dies , what of Meynoc ? " " Tamborel , hush up . " Eleyna thrust the lamp at Hwyllum and seized Tamborel in a fierce embrace , rocking him back and forth . Tamborel clung tightly in return . To lose one 's mamma ! What if Eleyna were to die ? At last , Eleyna released him and gently pushed him onto his pillow . " You 're a wonderful , caring boy , Tam'shu , " she said , tucking him in again . " But you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have a vigil lamp to light . " A votive lantern , like those already flickering under all the other sabas up and down the street , fervent wishes for Rufina 's recovery . Tamborel stared at the glow from his archway : lamplight reflecting down the passage from the middle room . His lattice cut dark bars across the light , making his room a cell . The corner shadows menaced now . If he closed his eyes and let himself go , might he die , too ?  | Clinging to wakefulness , Tamborel latched onto the comforting mix of noises from beyond his arch : the jingle of heynim , the quiet clatter of pots and dishes as his parents cleared up the kitchen , and the murmur of their voices . These formed his nightly lullaby . But this night he found no comfort in the talking . He tossed , and tossed again . Did Meynoc lie awake also ? Oh , how he wished that he could help his friend 's mamma ! A sudden rattle awoke him . Someone was at the Saba @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he been asleep ? He reached his archway as his father opened the lattice , and saw that it was dark outside . Now came an urgent exchange of voices . Tamborel held still , straining his ears . " ... if you leave now . " That was Bombrul , breathless and a-roil . " Casinder says you might just catch it . It 's our last hope , Hwyllum . Can you make it through the dark ? " Tamborel frowned . More talk , too low for him to hear . Hwyllum  --  leaving home and in the middle of the night ? He snapped aside his lattice and ran out . The middle room was empty . Eleyna was with Bombrul in the kitchen , filling Hwyllum 's water flask . " Tam'shu ! What are you doing out of bed ? " At that moment , Hwyllum appeared , dressed for the fields . " Pappa ! " Tamborel ran to him and seized his cape . " Do n't go ! " 14 15  | " There now . " Hwyllum struggled to disengage himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy is getting in a teasel ! " Eleyna bustled into the middle room , thrusting the flask and a food pack into Hwyllum 's hand . " Young man , back to your room . " She shooed Tamborel away and went with Hwyllum to the saba . " No ! " Tamborel ran after them . " Pappa , take me with you ! " Tears came without warning , blurring his eyes . Hwyllum paused by the saba lamp , looking stern . " Young man , even Bombrul can not come . For I must run all night , and much of tomorrow . Your mamma will explain . " Hwyllum patted his head , then strode to the gate with Bombrul . Tamborel watched the two men salute each other then take their leave , Bombrul turning toward his house , Hwyllum setting off into the dark at a trot , away from the village . Eleyna drew Tamborel back into the house . " You 're trembling , Tam'shu . Come on , into bed with you , then I 'll tell you where your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! No ! " Tamborel broke away from Eleyna , raced off into his parents ' room , and threw himself across the low , wide bed . " I stay with you tonight ! " " But Tam'shu , " his mother protested . " You 'll never sleep . Oh , well , " she went on , as Tamborel clung to the covers . " Come on . But not too much talking , un-derstand ? " Tamborel climbed into his pappa 's empty space and sat up , hugging his knees . " Pappa said you would explain , " he insisted doggedly .  | Eleyna was reaching to turn out the bedside lamp . With a sigh , she straightened up again . " Rufina is no better ; neither Yornwey nor Casinder can heal her , not even with their faleyn tuned in augmentation . " " That 's terrible ! " Tamborel burst out . " But what is Pappa doing ? Where 's he gone ? " " The city road runs west of Pridicum . Casinder says a caravan is due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . There 's someone in it who can fix Rufina . " " I know ! I know who ! " Tamborel waved his arms about . " Silwender  --  the High Zjarn of Minavar ! " The greatest healer in the world who went out fixing everyone , except in the rains . Silwender lived in the lion faleyn , the Hall of Harmonies , where he taught the laws of harmony and the healing arts . Tamborel wished that he lived in the Hon'faleyn . Wished that he could watch Silwender every day tuning his faleyn . A Grand Con-cat-en-ation , Mamma had called it , a faleyn that size . He pictured Silwender a very giant , bigger than Filar the smith , striding by , trailing a swarm long as a comet 's tail . Surely when the High Zjarn passed , everybody stopped and stared and listened , transfixed in his glistening web of chimes . Now Tamborel saw himself a zjarn with such a heynim cloud , saw the village people begging him to come and heal Rufina . He saw himself beside Rufina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had never yet been heard : a Grand Con-cat-en-ation resounding Clear to Pridicum !  | " Did Yornwey study with Silwender , Mamma ? " " Oh , no , Tam'shu . Only the very gifted enter the Hon'faleyn . " " Poor Yornwey . " Who could not help Rufina . Tamborel shuddered . Eleyna reached for him and held him tight . " It 's all right . Rufina will not die . " Tamborel shrank into the shelter of his mother 's arm . There was a place beyond the grainfields where the dead were buried . Most had died of old age , but there were some who had succumbed despite Mistress Bider 's remedies and Yornwey 's faleyn . The High Zjarn could have helped them , too . " What if Silwender does n't come ? He never has before . " " That 's because we 're too far off the beaten track , even farther out than Pridicum . Do n't worry . Pappa will bring him , Tam'shu . " " Will I get to meet him ? " Eleyna sighed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how . But tell you what : tomorrow you may stand at the gate and watch him pass by . "  | After breakfast , as Tamborel went to run to the gate , Eleyna stopped him . " But you promised , Mamma ! " " It 's too early , Tam'shu . Besides , I need your help right now . " Tamborel helped clear the table and wash the dishes , sighing loudly all the while . Not that he minded helping ; he was just all of an itch to watch for his father  --  and for Silwender . When the dishes were put away and the house was swept and tidied , Eleyna set jars of aromatic oils to warm in the hearth . " Strong and fit as Pappa is , he 's never run so far and last . He 'll be in sore need of rubbing down , Tam'shu . " Pungent odors filled the house , making his eyes  | water . Around noon , Eleyna filled the laundry copper , and lit a fire beneath it to heat water for Hwyllum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  at the summer 's height ! The copper boiled and steam ran down the walls . He fled to the saba , pressing his face to the stones , seeking the slightest breeze , while his mother , strands of hair plastered to her crimson cheeks , labored on . At last she called : " Go to the gate now , Tam'shu . Pappa should be coming soon ! " Freed at last , Tamborel raced to the gate and looked down the street toward the Pridicum road . He stood there for an age , but Hwyllum did not appear . Tamborel grew anxious . Could Pappa have come to harm ? The shadows lengthened . Then , toward dusk , Tamborel became aware of the strangest feeling . His skin prickled , the hairs stood out on his arms , and he felt a flash of energy , the sort he sometimes experienced after a rich , sugary pudding . Tamborel rubbed his arms expectantly . Something was in the air . But what ? Up the road , about a mile away : a tiny puff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ran . His body felt so light he scarcely could feel the ground . Behind him , folk streamed out , shading their eyes against the falling sun . Reaching the village boundary , Tamborel pulled up . And then he heard it : a wash of distant chimes . So that was it ! He had felt their vibrations even before his ears could pick them up !  | Tamborel strove to see through the growing dust cloud . Nearer it swirled , nearer , nearer . . . . The chimes grew louder : such a full , rich sound , even at this distance . Folk pushed in front of him , edging him aside so that he had to fight to keep his place . Everyone went still . Two shapes emerged from the dust cloud : Hwyllum , staggering along beside a beast with serpent neck and bulging belly atop four high , spindly legs : a qarl , that the Minavar merchants rode when they came to bid for grain at harvest . Perched crosslegged upon the qarl 's box saddle was a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straggly silver hair and beard . But in spite of his frail appearance , he rode easy with the beast 's bumpy gait , his right hand loose on the reins . His pale blue robe hung on him in folds ; in his left hand he held a small blue parasol , goldfringed , although the sun 's rays were almost horizontal now , and slicing underneath it . Above the dust cloud swirled the old man 's heynim like a golden halo circling the sun . Tamborel stood spellbound  --  until Hwyllum , drawing level with him , staggered , and almost fell . " Pappa'shu ! " Tamborel dashed forward , but stronger hands reached out , bearing Hwyllum up . Silwender leaned out from his lofty perch and Tamborel met the old man 's eye . He stared , caught in the High Zjarn 's watery appraisal . Then the qarl was lurching onward 20 21  | down the street , and the man was past , his vast swarm churning high above the people 's heads . Tamborel watched the procession dwindle up the street , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idle state , circling untuned , he felt their latent power . Before he knew it , he was trotting after , his father forgotten . " Tam'shu ! " Eleyna 's voice brought him up short . " Where do you think you 're going ? " Men were carrying Hwyllum through their garden gate . What could Tamborel do but accompany his mother into the house ? Those heynim ! Those wondrous harmonies ! Tamborel 's whole body was tight with desire . At that very moment Silwender was tuning up a Grand Concatenation and here he was , stuck inside stone walls , no hope that the sound would carry this far . His only chance ever to hear such chiming ! Tamborel helped Eleyna fill a bowl with warm water and wet a pile of cloths , picturing Silwender in Rufina 's chamber all the while . How would that wondrous swarm fit into one small space ? he wondered , as Eleyna knelt to tend his father 's feet . They were so swollen that Eleyna had to cut away his shoes . Slowly , tenderly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off caked in blood and grit and sticking to the flesh . Surely it must hurt , thought Tamborel , as his mother eased them off . But his lather never once complained or even flinched : it was  | not his way . At last , Eleyna handed Hwyllum a herbal cup to sip , and slid his bloody feet into a bowl of Mistress Bider 's cleansing balm . Tamborel watched guiltily . Bad boy , wanting to slip away to hear the High Zjarn 's music with his father in this state . He followed Eleyna into the kitchen . " Pappa looks very bad . " " Well , he 's lost so much fluid , you see , Tam'shu , " Eleyna said . " And his muscles are wasted . But with a hot soak , a herbal rub , and a good night 's sleep he 'll be fine again come morning . " Eleyna hugged Tamborel , stroking his hair . " You 're a dear , good boy . You worked so hard for me today . I could n't have managed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pappa 's bath . Then it 's time for bed . " The moment Eleyna slid his lattice closed , Tamborel slid out of bed and ran to his saraba . The window hole was small , and round , and needed but one shutter . Set into the side of the house , it faced the narrow space between dwellings . Outside noises did not carry well into this sleeping chamber : an asset ? until now . Tamborel pressed his ear to the shutter slats , strainbig for the slightest sound of chiming . Nothing , as he had expected . Oh , to think of all that he was missing ! fie pictured Rufina lying on her bed , her skin clammy and cold , her brow beaded with sweat , the way his had been with the moldy fever . Yornwey 's faleyn had  | flowed through him like cool spring water , washing the fever from his body . Lucky Rufina , to feel the flood of great Silwender 's harmonies ! Well , he thought , trying to make the best of it , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps feel them as he had before ? Tamborel went still , holding his breath , setting his mind on that shining , gold loud . All at once , he felt the air quiver . His skin goosed up as though from a sudden draft . Then his whole body went light and trembly , as it had before . Elated , Tamborel wanted to jump up and down but knew that he must stay quiet still or lose everything . He let his breath out cautiously  --  then lost focus anyhow at a quick new thought : What if he unlatched his shutter , climbed out the saraba  --  and ran to Rufina ; 5 house ? Mamma and Pappa need never know , not if he waited until after they had gone to sleep . And no one would see him in the dark . Tamborel shivered with excitement . Oh , the danger of it ! He 'd never dare  --  would he ? Footsteps sounded in the passage outside . Mamma , coming to see if he was asleep . Tamborel ran , dove under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listened to her steps recede , heard his parents in the bedchamber next door . He sat up straight now , watching the glow on the wall outside . It faded . Mamma had turned out her lamp . Tamborel waited , his heart racing . He must decide , now . There came a rustle as his parents settled down .  | Then silence . Slowly , Tamborel set his feet to the floor . Then he tiptoed to the saraba and inched up the shutter latch . Gingerly , he let it down and swung the slatted frame open . The neighbor 's house was dark , a low , squat bulk against the deep night sky . Tamborel pulled himself up onto the curving sill and peered down . It was n't too far to the ground , an easy climb to get back in . Gingerly , he swung his legs over . Then , bracing himself , he tumbled out onto the turf below .  | Tamborel crouched , tense , then , when nothing happened , he picked himself up and stole around to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There , he paused again , wavering . He had n't dreamed it would be so dark . And Rufina 's house was way down the far end of the street , past the well at the Y-fork , and as far again , almost to where the cobbles gave way to stony track at the grainfields ' edge . That was the way men trod to and from work each day , and where he took the path to the brook . He looked into the darkness fearfully . The street seemed so different now . And what if Mamma woke up and found him gone ! Bad boy , to run out like this ,  | knowing it was wrong . But he had to hear Silwender 's chimes ! Tamborel pattered off down the street , his nightshirt catching at his legs . The deep , round cobblestones hurt the soles of his feet , making him wish that he 'd put on his shoes . He glanced fearfully to either side . The tiny flames under each house saba burned like eyes , watching him . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the well and Tamborel cried aloud . A nearby gate creaked on its hinges and he almost turned and ran but just then the tingling began again , tugging him on . He was almost there when he heard voices . People stood by Rufina 's gate , watching the house . Mistress Bider , for one ; Mother Turner , for another . Oh , oh , they 'd find him out for sure , he told himself , but he could n't back down now . He ducked sideways through the nearest gateway and ran to the rear of the house . From there , he made his way through the remaining backyards to Rufina 's , under the pull of the chimes . Light blazed through every saraba , cutting between the shutter slats . Loud chimes beat the night air , while single notes tumbled in and out , a snatch of melody repeated over and over . Tamborel listened until he found himself humming along . The notes climbed . Now each tone took on a sort of echo way up high that set Tamborel 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weird overtones , around the side of the house , coming at last to Rufina 's chamber . Grasping the saraba sill , he pulled himself up and peered inside . Spheres swarmed , so thick that Tamborel could scarcely make out Rufina in bed and Silwender standing beside her . And the sound ! Too much ! Letting go , Tamborel fell into a heap under the saraba sill . And there he lay , his hands clapped to his ears . The chiming swelled until it hurt . Surely his head would burst ! He curled up , terrified . He could n't move . He could n't even call out  --  and if he did , who would hear him over all that sound ? All at once , somewhere deep within him , something unraveled , and slowly , Tamborel took his hands away and let the sounds engulf him . There came a clap of thunder , then a rushing of wind  --  or was it the gush of floodwater ? Colors swirled , music rolled . Then all was dark again . Perhaps he slept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and quiet , like a low , slow pulse . Tamborel cracked an almighty yawn , then stretched . He could stand up now , he found . Reaching shakily on tiptoe , he peeped through Rufina 's shutter slats . The swarm was slowly circling around the chamber , the old man in the middle . And Bombrul was pulling the archway lattice aside . Tamborel turned away and made for home . The  | watchers by the gate had gone . The streets were utterly deserted . It seemed that the village , the whole world had slowed , and gone into a deep slumber . He reached his front gate in a daze , climbed back through his saraba and closed the shutter . Then , falling into bed , Tamborel went to sleep at once . When he awoke , it was light . He came up slowly into wakefulness , remembering . He thought of the wondrous sounds rolling over him , swamping his senses , and the marvelous play of colors swirling around him in the dark . He remembered how at first he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he told himself , pulling on his clothes . " Those really high notes that hurt my ears . " Tamborel had never heard their like . Eleyna might know what they were  --  but it would not be wise to ask her , he decided , as he went in to breakfast . His mamma kissed him , set out his bowl , seemingly in great spirits . " You 're late , Tam'shu . Never mind , everyone in this village is up late today . Your pappa 's not yet even awake . What is that you 're humming ? " He was humming ? Indeed he was : a catch from the High Zjarn 's Grand Concatenation  --  but he could hardly tell Eleyna . " How is Rufina , Mamma ? " " Much better , Mistress Bider says . She 's in a deep and healing sleep . You remember how that was , m'sh u ? " " Oh , yes , " Tamborel said , but he was n't thinking of Yornwey and the moldy fever . He sighed , recalling  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It occurred to him then that Silwender would soon be leaving . " Can I watch the High Zjarn ride out , Mamma ? " " Sorry , Tam'shu . He 's already gone . " " No ! " Tamborel eyed Eleyna in dismay . " How could he in the dark ? " " Hush . " Eleyna gestured toward her bedchamber . " Guides came for him , they say . Pity you missed him , but he has a way to go . It was a big favor to break his journey and come so far off his regular route . Maybe when she 's well enough , Rufina can tell us how it was to feel such power , eh , Tam'shu ? Would you like that ? " Tamborel looked away . Those chimes , he had felt them also . Felt their influence still . He should be out of sorts to find Silwender gone . But he was too ... peaceful , somehow . He wondered how Meynoc had felt so close to the wondrous chiming . Now Tamborel had an urge to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He glanced sideways to Eleyna . " Will you be needing me ? " Eleyna laughed aloud . " Eat your breakfast and wash your face , " she said . " Your fishing crock is waiting by the saba . " When Tamborel got to the brook , Meynoc was not there . He stood , uncertain as to what to do . Maybe if he hung around , Meynoc would come . The other big  | boys eyed him sourly , but suffered him to stay  --  at a distance . Tamborel dipped his net into the stream , watching the others sideways . They looked subdued , even furtive , and they kept their voices unusually low . .. she 'll stay abed the full two months more , my mamma says . She 'll lose it , else , " said one , a boy named Rafil . " Better she did , my mamma says . She would n't want to keep a thing that almost killed her , " said another , Fodir . " Hush . " A third looked Tamborel 's way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell , and we 'll be whipped . " Tamborel turned from them , his ears burning . The boys talked on , their voices rising and falling in waves . " . . . Meynoc said his mamma wants it bad . He said it 's not the baby 's fault his mamma got blood poison , " Rafil remarked , his voice coming back up to its normal shout . " I said hush ! " Fodir warned . " We 're not supposed to know yet that babies grow inside their mother .... " Tamborel 's hands tightened on the handle of his fishing net . They were talking about Rufina . And a baby . He stared fixedly at the bright , swirling water , his cheeks aflame . He knew that babies grew inside their mother , had n't Eleyna explained last year when he could n't help but see how Mistress Bider had grown so fat ? Although , now her baby was born ,  | Mistress Bider was not a whit smaller . In fact , she was larger , now , if anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby , poisoning its mother 's blood ? Tamborel frowned . How , when it was not yet born ? Tamborel sat , his net forgotten . Along the bank , the boys scrambled up , gathered their gear , and trooped away . Sighing , Tamborel withdrew his net , picked up his empty crock and trudged home after them , thinking of the child as yet unborn . " Poor baby , " he murmured to himself . It had suffered just as much as Rufina , had almost died along with her . And here it was , taking all the blame . Tamborel halted in his tracks . Poor baby ? The unborn child had suffered , yes . Had almost died . But it had also felt the full force of the High Zjarn 's healing chimes !  | Tamborel scuffed his toes impatiently by the gate , watching the saba . He looked along the street toward Rufina 's , where they were supposed to be going . If ever they 're ready . " He glanced in the other direction , westward to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Silwender came in a cloud of dust to heal Rtifina . Now they were to mark it in a very special way . " Tam'shu ! " Eleyna called out behind him . " Do you want your good clothes dirty before we 're out the gate ? Come inside ! " Sighing , Tamborel obeyed . Eleyna had been fussing with her dress and hair for an hour now . " The 36 Gathering 's started . What if they 're naming the baby already ? " " And Pappa the Grand Mareschal in charge of Ceremony ? Not to mention that he 's also to be her father-mentor . They 'll wait for us , do n't worry . You want to share a big secret , Tam'shu ? Come . " Eleyna beckoned him inside . Secret ? Tamborel hurried into his parents ' bedchamber . Eleyna went to the glass and began pinning up her tawny curls . She looked so very beautiful today , Tamborel observed proudly . In her long yellow gown that she kept for high holidays and with her hair piled high , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret ? " Tamborel 's father was over by the linen chest . " Show him , Pappa , " Eleyna said . " See . " Hwyllum took something up off the chest top : a carved wooden box , inlaid with bits of brown shell . He put the box to Tamborel 's ear and shook it . From within came a high , thin tinkling . Tamborel looked up . " A heyn ? " Hwyllum raised the box lid for Tamborel to peep inside . Yes , a heyn , lying like a tiny golden egg in a blue velvet nest . " Where 's it from , Pappa ? What 's it doing in the box ? " " Silwender sent it . It 's for Rufina 's baby , to mark her naming day . " " The High Zjarn asked Pappa to present it , is n't that grand ? " Eleyna stuck a flower pin through her top-  | knot , eyeing its angle critically . " Because he saved Rufina 's life , I 'm sure . " " And the baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proudly now . Hwyllum was the hero of the hour . As a consequence , they 'd made him Grand Mareschal of this Gathering , although he was not a man for public speaking . In addition , Rufina and Bombrul had asked him to be the baby 's father-mentor . Now this great honor bestowed on him by the High Zjarn himself . The day was getting better by the minute ! Hwyllum wrapped the box in a napkin and tucked it into Eleyna 's flower-filled basket . Eleyna set down her hairbrush and gave her skirts a final twirl . " Ready . " She picked up the basket and at long last they set off down the street . Tamborel kept looking at the basket , thinking of the shining , golden secret inside . That baby just ten months born and owning a heyn already , without ever having done a thing ! The yard was crowded . Rufina sat in the matron 's bower , receiving guests and gifts . A yard or so away , the baby lay sleeping in a child-pen , shaded by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around at everything  --  especially t he clusters of heynim dancing over the assembly . He loved Gatherings , when all the spheres in the village were brought into one place . He closed his eyes , savoring the chimes : bubbling , bouncing , golden rivulets , swirling like the currents in the minnow  | brook with the movements of their owners ' heads . He heard someone laugh , a quick burst of notes . To his left , Yornwey walked by : he 'd know her soothing harmonies anywhere . " Here , Tam'shu . " Tamborel opened his eyes . Eleyna stood before him , her flower basket on her arm . She slipped the heyn box from the basket and into his hand . " Hold it  --  careful now . Do n't let anyone see it until we say . " Tamborel watched her walk away . He , entrusted with the shining , golden secret ! He slid the box inside his jacket and crossed his arms protectively . Lucky baby , to get such a gift . Tamborel made for the baby 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , surrounded by Mother Turner and a bunch of other wives . " Kutchy-coo . " Mother Turner leaned down . " Pretty one , your mamma should be proud . " " Grateful , more like , " Mistress Bider muttered , glancing fondly to her own child hugging her skirts : Tancey , who was two years old now . " Poisoning poor Rufina like that ! Lucky she did n't die . " Mother Turner frowned . " ' Twere n't the new baby 's fault Rufina took sick like that . Besides , she nearly died , too . " " They say Yornwey told Rufina not to have another child after Meynoc . " " There ! You see ? " a third wife hissed . " That 's what comes of ignoring our healer 's advice : a little monster ! "  | " Gah , " the little monster said , screwing up her face and reaching out toward them . " Look ! You see that scowl ? She knows what you 're saying . I 'd watch my tongue if I were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mistress Bider scooped up Tancey and the women moved away . Monster ? Evil eye ? Tamborel went sore inside , as though he 'd been physically hurt . The meanness ! He wondered why they came to the Gathering at all ! Tamborel edged forward , peering into the pen , seizing a rare chance to study the child alone and at such close quarters . Her eyes were large , and round , and a deep , clear blue . Her hair was wiry as a frytt-burr , and dark , like Bombrul 's . As he stood there , sizing her up , she upped onto her hands and knees and scrambled nimbly toward him . " Gah , " she said . Reaching the place where he stood , she grasped the side of the pen , pulled herself up and clung unsteadily . " Gah . Uh-gah . " Tamborel leaned down and looked into her eyes . Their gaze held , and in that moment , Tamborel thought of the night , one whole year before , when he 'd lain beneath Rufina 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , he told her silently , you heard them , too . Felt them ! And as he thought it , he knew then that she was going to be special ? t hough not any monster ! Tamborel glanced around to see that no one ohserved , then to the treasure inside his jacket . " Do n't 38 39  | let anyone see it , " Eleyna had told him , expressly . But surely that did n't mean the baby . After all , it was going to be hers any minute now . He slipped the napkin-covered box from under his coat and held it out . " Here : you 've a gift from Silwender , High Zjarn of Minavar ! Listen . " He shook the box by her ear , starting soft chimes within . Letting go the side of the pen , the baby grabbed for the box with such force that she toppled over backward , her feet in the air . " Gah ! Uh-gah ! " She rolled , was pulling herself back on her feet in an instant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the box quickly behind his back . " In a bit , you 'll get it in a bit , " he said . The baby sat down with a bump and began to bawl . Hwyllum came up , looking flustered . " It 's naming time . I must call the Gathering to order . You have the box ? " " Yes , Pappa ! " Tamborel held it out . " Pappa , the baby knows ? " " Later . " Hwyllum pushed the box away . " Keep it till I say . Come on . " At Hwyllum 's signal , a bell sounded , and everyone gathered around Rufina 's bower . Tamborel went to stand by Hwyllum , the box behind his back . Through the sudden stillness , the baby 's cries rang out , strident , demanding . " Good gracious , " Rufina murmured anxiously . " Whatever can be wrong ? "  | " Not to worry , " Mother Turner reassured her . " Children surely do pick their times . " Cerie , Rufina 's sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby from the pen , patting her back , trying to hush her squalling . Tamborel watched , brimming with guilt . His fault , his , for showing her Silwender 's heyn . But how was he to know that it would set her off like that ? There were heynim all around her and she 'd not gone after them in this way . Hwyllum cleared his throat . " We are gathered here , " he began , then started over , vying with the baby 's wails . " We are gathered here on this joyous occasion to name this child . As you all know , this is past the proper time for naming . But in view of the remarkable event that preceded her birth , namely , the coming of the great High Zjarn of Minavar , it was decided to hold the Gathering on this , the anniversary of Silwender 's visit . Now let us begin . " Hwyllum turned to Bombrul . " Who is father to this child ? " he called loudly . As if everyone did n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand beside Hwyllum . " I am . " " And who , the mother ? " am . " Rufina spoke up shyly . Then she went on , speaking the mother 's part . " Who will be mothermentor to our child ? " " I , Cerie of Fahwyll , " Cerie said , jiggling the baby ,  | who , mercifully , was falling quiet . " My hearth and heart shall evermore be open to her need . " Now Bombrul spoke the father 's part . " Who 'll be father-mentor to our child ? " Everyone turned to Hwyllum expectantly . " I , Hwyllum of Fahwyll . " He took the baby gingerly from Cerie 's arms . " My hearth and heart shall evermore be open to her need . " Tamborel let out a deep sigh of satisfaction . The grandness of it all ! Bombrul spoke again . " Now who will say our new child 's chosen name ? " " ! will , " Hwyllum answered . " As Grand Mareschal of this Gathering , I do proclaim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Caidrun : gift of healing ! Tamborel gazed triumphantly around . There ! That should fix them . Rufina took back her child , smiling at the guests . Now Hwyllum took the heyn box from Tamborel , unwrapped it , and held it up . " From Silwender , High Zjarn : a naming gift for Caidrun . " He raised the lid a slit and carefully withdrew the heyn between thumb and forefinger . The tiny golden globe sparkled in the sunlight , and its high , tinkling music danced . " Oh ! " Rufina cried amid the general exclamations . " Why would he send our Caidrun such a precious thing ? " Bombrul took it carefully from Hwyllum 's hand . " Precious thing for precious child . Let no one doubt  | it , see ! " He held it high for everyone to admire . The sun caught it , making it flash . At that , Caidrun exclaimed and reached toward it . " Look ! " Rufina cried . " She seeks to snag it already ! " The people laughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Behind Tamborel , Mistress Bider murmured . " Such nonsense . We all have had to keep our heynim out of our children 's reach . All babies of that age grab for everything that moves . " " And everything that shines , " Mistress Bewly agreed . " How many bead necklaces did I lose to my Tolas 's clutching fingers ! " Tamborel jumped up and down , scarce able to contain himself . Were they blind ? Rufina was right . The heyn was not just any old bright thing to catch her attention . " Caidrun knows that heyn ! " he muttered fiercely . Cups were filled and passed around . Even Tamborel got a thimbleful . Hwyllum raised his cup . " To Caidrun ! " " To Caidrun ! " everyone shouted , and drank . Tamborel wiped his mouth with the back of his hand . Now Hwyllum called for musicians and the folk to begin a slow chain dance , hopping and shuffling through the house and around the outside walls , to weave the baby 's new name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortune . They set Caidrun down inside her pen , and , stowing the heyn box in  | Rufina 's bower , Rufina and Bombrul took hands . Guests lined up behind them , men behind Bombrul , women behind Rufina , hand to shoulder , stretching back , then the columns moved away to stately pipe and tambour , around the house and out of sight . Those not so limber stayed behind , fanning themselves against the heat . " Such a waste , " complained Mistress Bewly . " That so fine and precious a thing will lie shut away for so long  --  ten more years , at least ! " " Lucky little mite , " another woman sniffed . " To own a heyn from birth . " " Lucky ? " Mother Turner shook her head . " To miss snagging her first heyn ? I well remember mine . Just thirteen , I was . I were that excited I let it go . " Now they were off , all talking at once . " ... my boy Rafil 's almost old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years old before I held on to one , and then it ... " " ... sister only twelve , and snagging three . But could I catch a one ? " Tamborel could keep quiet no longer . " Caidrun will snag hers quite soon , you 'll see . She 's reaching out already . " The women laughed merrily . " Get away with you , young Tamborel , " Mother Turner said . " No mere child can snag a heyn . " " Caidrun will . She 's special . "  | " Special ? " Mother Turner looked quizzical . " How so , young man ? " " She felt the High Zjarn 's power before she was even born . " " Well ! " Mistress Bider cried . " Hark at him ! What does he know about such things ? " Mother Turner laughed good-naturedly . " You must admit he 's quite the hero , standing up for little Missy there . " " By the skies , what are you doing , boy ? Hanging around , listening to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Get away with you , go find Meynoc . " " But Pappa ? " Hwyllum shooed him away . At the corner of the house , Tamborel paused and glanced back to where the baby sat underneath her canopy . " Caidrun . " He tested it out aloud . If Pappa was her father-mentor , was not he , Tamborel , now her brother , in a way ? That thought pleased him greatly , having no blood sibling at home . " I know you 're special , Caidrun . I 'll look after you , I promise , " he said , then ran to find the older boys .  | The next day , Tamborel tried to make his parents understand what had really happened . " I shook the box at Caidrun and she grabbed at it . She knew that it was hers  --  that was why she made so much fuss . " " You had no business showing it to her , after your mamma told you to keep it hid , " Hwyllum said , frowning . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tantrum , though , " Eleyna said . " She looks set to be quite a mettlesome miss . I 'd say Rufina 's going to have her hands full . " Tamborel saw his chance . " I can help . I 'll play with Caidrun while Rufina gets her work done . " Eleyna shot him a look . " What ? You  --  serve as  | Caidrun 's nursemaid ? Why , you do n't know the child . You 've hardly ever seen her . " But I do know her , thought Tamborel . Caidrun 's special , even if you can not see it . " I want to mind her . " Hwyllum snorted . " What  --  going on seven and asking to play with a baby only ten months old ? I never heard such nonsense . What 's gotten into you ? " Tamborel looked down . All he knew was , now he 'd seen Caidrun close up , he wanted to be with her , to look after her . That , having shared a singular experience with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her , somehow . He saw again those wide blue eyes on him . She 'd taken to him , and meaning well , he 'd shown her the heyn box , only to snatch it away . His fault that she 'd cried and spoiled her naming ceremony . " I want to help . " " Then help your mamma , " Hwyllum said . " Or lend me a hand in the field . " " He 's lonely , Pappa . " Eleyna went to give Tamborel a hug . " He has no one of his own age to play with ; no brother or sister of his own . " Tamborel seized his chance . " Now , I have . If Pappa is Caidrun 's father-mentor , that makes me a sort of brother , does n't it ? " Eleyna laughed . " You must admit he makes a point . " She released Tamborel , stroked his hair . " You 're a very counselor , Tam'shu . I 'll speak to Rufina and maybe she 'll let you visit and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of the summer , Tamborel dropped by Rufina 's yard each day to mind Caidrun in her pen . He took along a rag doll that Eleyna had made , and a set of small , smooth building stones that he 'd culled from the shallows of the brook . He danced the doll , showed her how to build with the stones , even though Caidrun 's chief amusement was to knock them down and scatter them again . When she tired of playing , he sang songs to her , little game chants like the one the older boys used in a ring game to pick the middle one . " One ear of grain , two ears of grain , three and another make four . . . . " He made up tales about the creatures of the grainfields . He also told stories that the grain merchants brought from outside , scary tales about the Jagged Mountains west of Minavar ; a desolate , forbidden range where mist wraiths danced at the edge of the world . He told his own favorites , scary tales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of the girl who danced with the mist wraiths and fell under their spell . And of the foolish boy who went to the mountains in the monsoons and was washed into the earth like salt . Caidrun listened , rapt , curled in the crook of his arm . " Away with you , Tamborel , " Rufina said , pretending to scold . " It 's a good job she 's too young to understand , or she 'd be keeping us up of nights with nightmares . But I declare , she seems quite taken with your stories and your singing . Meynoc , her own brother , ca n't occupy her so well as that . "  | After harvesting , as the days drew in , Rufina moved the pen inside . And Tamborel continued to visit , no more pining after Meynoc and the rest . Here , at Rufina 's , he was welcome . No " Go be a good boy . " Or " Run off , you 're too small to go with us . " The moment Tamborel stepped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her joy at seeing him was nectar to his spirit . Now Rufina let Caidy out of the pen , under Tamborel 's watchful care . Holding both her hands firmly , he walked her patiently around the room until one day she let go and took her first steps unaided . " Rufina ! Quick ! Caidrun 's walking ! " " Uh-gah ! " cried Caidrun , and raised a fist in glee . " Well , look at that ! " cried Rufina , and Caidrun promptly sat down . From then on , there was no stopping her . Every day there was something new to marvel at . Then she began to speak single words : Pappa , Mamma . Ay-nock . And , to Tamborel 's delight , Brel  --  her name for him . Tamborel did note one strange thing : while other babies grew used to heynim , coming finally to ignore t hem , Caidrun seemed to find them ever more attractive . At times , when in a cranky mood , she would just sit and yell for Rufina to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On those occasions , only those high , thin notes would restore Caidrun 's good humor . The first rains set in , heralding the monsoons . Now  | when Tamborel visited Rufina 's house , Caidrun latched onto him , trotted after him from room to room  --  except when Rufina was by . Then Caidrun clamored to be lifted up , so that she could grab for her mother 's heynim . " Look at that , " Meynoc said , laughing with brotherly pride . " When there 's a heyn in the offing , she has no time for us , Tamborel . " One afternoon , as Tamborel arrived at Meynoc 's house , Rufina burst from the kitchen , Caidrun in her arms . " Here , " Rufina said , setting Caidrun down in the middle of the floor . " She 's after my chimes again . I 'll never get the supper made at this rate . Mind her , you boys . Keep her occupied . " Meynoc shrugged . " How , Mamma ? " Caidrun clung to Rufina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " " Music ? " Rufina turned to Tamborel . " Will you sing to her ? " In front of Meynoc ? Tamborel looked down . " I ca n't , just now . " Caidrun began to struggle and kick , threatening a full tantrum . " Oh , dear . " Rufina grew desperate . " I know . " She dashed into her bedchamber , came back brandishing Silwender 's gift . " Here , Meynoc , jiggle this at her . Make sure the catch stays closed  --  and do n't let her have hold of it . " As she hurried back to the kitchen , Caidrun opened her mouth to bawl , but before she could utter a sound , Meynoc shook the  | box , starting the chimes within . Caidrun stopped absolutely still . Then she turned on Meynoc , her face radiant . " Oosiks , Ay-nock . " Meynoc shoved the box at Tamborel . " Here . You take charge . " He threw himself back into his seat and put his feet up . Tamborel could scarce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box since Caidrun 's naming party . It was smaller than he remembered , and it had gotten dull . He buffed it on his sleeve , shining up the brown shell inlay , then he shook it , listening to the tiny chimes . " Brel ! " Caidrun teetered toward him , smiling , arms outstretched . " Go on , " Meynoc urged . " Shake it again . Let her hear . " " But ? " Too late , Tamborel realized that this was the naming day all over again . He could n't let Caidrun have the box , and this was going to make her cry  --  or worse , start a full-blown tantrum . As Caidrun squeezed up her face to yell , Tamborel held out the box and shook it lightly . " Listen , Caidy . " Caidrun canceled the yell , grabbed for the box and missed . Meynoc clapped his hands , delighted . " That 's it ! Go for it , Caidy ! " What could Tamborel do but hold out the box again , then snatch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relief , Caidrun found this amusing . Now they were 50 51  | off , playing tag with the heyn box ; Caidrun trying to seize it , Tamborel keeping it just out of reach . At last , she got it , catching Tamborel off guard . He tugged , she held on , and they toppled sideways , shrieking with laughter , the box clutched between them . " Hey ! " Rufina hustled from the kitchen and took the box away . " You go too far ! I meant for the box to be shaken , Tamborel , not used as a toy ! And you , Meynoc : lazy boy , just sitting there . Why did you not stop them ? " Meynoc only grinned . " You should see Caidrun , Mamma . She 's so quick and strong . And determined , too . " " Enough ! You 'll turn your sister 's head , " she said , looking pleased even so . " You , Tamborel , run off home now . It 's almost suppertime : your mamma will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the skies lightened , and Hwyllum went out to the muddy grainfields , cutting drainage lines and preparing the soil for spring tillage . Now folk started looking upward , watching for heynim . One week into the tilling , the first stragglers were sighted : a modest cluster , barely more than the fingers of one hand . Now began the yearly scramble when villagers made good their losses  --  for the heynim did not last forever . After a number of seasons , they fell prey to wet and wind . Their luster faded , the chimes fell silent ; they lost their buoyancy  | and tumbled to the ground . Then they were respectfully buried , and replaced . The snagging over , folk went back to work , for there was always much to do after the monsoons , in both house and field . Hwyllum took Tamborel to help him hoe along the irrigation channels and pile uprooted weeds for compost . The work was tiring , but Tamborel did not mind , for bigger boys were working , too . It was good to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marked his age : seven now , going on eight . Now on days off , they did not object so much to his tagging along . The summer days whisked by , and suddenly , there was Rufina , calling with an invitation to the first anniversary of Caidrun 's naming . It should have been a small affair : handful of children , simple gifts , modest feast . But somehow , it turned into another full Gathering . Hwyllum did not approve . " It sets Caidrun apart , " he said . " And I will say as much . " " Now , Hwyllum , " Eleyna said . " The child was set apart even before she was born . Besides , you 're not her father , so hold your peace . " " That I sha n't . Am I not her mentor ? I have some say in her rearing . If Bombrul and Rufina are n't careful , the child will grow up spoiled . " Whether Hwyllum spoke or no , the Gathering was held . The day dawned hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the naming day one year before . Folk went to Rufina 's house , with gifts and dishes for the feast . In the center of the gift table , amid the toys and pretty clothes , was the heyn box . " To remind us all of the honor that Silwender did our girl , " Rufina explained proudly . Tamborel was drawn toward the small brown box . As though , having had charge of it twice now , it partly belonged to him . The grownups made speeches , Rufina showed Caidrun her gifts : straw dolls , woven throwing balls , a wooden cup and dish , smocks , petticoats , and pinafores , as became a child almost two years old . But when Caidrun caught sight of the heyn box , she wanted nothing else . She grasped the edge of the table , pulled herself on tiptoe , demanding for her mamma to hand it over . " No , little one . " Rufina moved it out of range . " You must wait until you 're older . " Caidrun puckered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She remembered the game they 'd played way back before the monsoons , when Tamborel had shaken the box and teased her . She had also held that box , for a moment , and likely remembered that , too . Caidrun began to yell . " Oosiks , oosiks ! " " You want music , Caidy ? Come , hear mamma 's chimes . " Rufina tried to draw Caidrun away , but she clung to the table , in full-throttled squall . " I 'll put it inside , " Bombrul said quickly . He took  | up the box and strode in under the saba . Caidrun strained after him , but Rufina gathered her up , and , smothering her with kisses , took her to get some berry cake . " Such a bright child , " Mother Turner remarked to Bennoc standing by . " Maybe too bright for her own good , " Bennoc answered soberly . " There 's a reason why children do n't take to heynim afore they 're old and wise enough . " There was ? Tamborel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . As far as he could see , the sooner Caidy could snag heynim , the sooner she 'd show how special she was . Did Bennoc sense this already ? Did he guess that Caidy might even enter the Hon'faleyn , and become greater than he could ever be ? The dancing began , and someone struck up a song , and Tamborel went to play quoits with Meynoc and the others . The party was at its height , when Tamborel went to get a drink of berry cordial . He was turning from the table when Caidrun 's laugh came from underneath . He stooped down , lifted the cloth . Caidrun  --  with Silwender 's box ! She shook it up at him in glee . " Oosiks , Brel . " Tamborel gazed at her , dismayed . If Rufina caught Caidrun with the box , there would be big trouble . He must retrieve it , fast . He reached out , but Caidrun snatched it back  --  so fast that she lost her balance , rolled , and let go the box . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , and the golden heyn shot from under the table then rose into the air . " Help ! Caidrun 's Horrified , Tamborel scrambled up . heyn is loose ! " he yelled . The sphere was almost out of sight . glimpsed upturned , In the sudden quiet , Tamborel g startled faces . Then the heyn checked . Who had snagged it ? He 'd soon find out . gaining speed . Too The little sphere descended , g much speed , thought Tamborel uneasily . Someone cried out . He saw with a shock that other were headed for left their ownerhs ' clusters and wer feet beside him , smiling up ! Caidrun , nom ' on Such power ! thought Tamborel . And he saw in a flash the wisdom of Bennoc 's words . The power was deadly , for Caidrun lacked control . pushed her just about to hit like slingshot ! down and threw himself atop her . his Pain , hot as lancing needles struck his back , face , his head as heynim rained down . He heard a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | Tamborel lay on his back , gazing into darkness . From high above , heynim drifted down like tiny golden bubbles , their delicate notes filling the space around him . A dream ? If so , he did n't want to lose it , did n't want to awaken yet . He loosed a long , contented sigh , and , attuned to the tinkling , tumbling notes , started to drift deeper ... deeper .... The notes receded . This was no dream , then . The chimes were real : A faleyn ! Tamborel struggled back up into wakefulness , toward the harmonies . As they grew stronger , his mind cleared . Not one faleyn : two . Yornwey 's , mixed in  | with another  --  not Bennoc 's , not Throm 's , yet he recognized it , vaguely . He frowned , trying to remember . Whose was it , where had he heard it ? Eleyna 's voice cut across his thought , shocking in its nearness . " He moved . He 's coming back . " " I told you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man speaking . The twin faleyn twirled faster , whipping him awake . Tamborel opened his eyes . The shutters were pulled up ; his chamber was flooded with light . Too bright , too bright ! He squeezed up his eyes , blinded by the brilliance . " Oh , he hurts . Do something ! " Eleyna again . The shutter rattled and the brightness dimmed . His mother had sounded agitated . Tamborel opened his eyes . Eleyna was leaning down with such an anxious face that Tamborel hastened to reassure her . " I 'm fine , Mamma . " His voice was strangely raspy . Tamborel licked his lips , found them split and dry . His mouth tasted bad , his throat stuck , and he could scarcely swallow . Water splashed into a cup . " Here , my boy . " Hwyllum ? " Pappa ! " Still at home in broad daylight ? Tamborel tried to sit up . " What time is it ? "  | Hwyllum made to push him back , but another stopped him . " It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hwyllum raised Tamborel and propped him back against the pillows . Now he could see the healer , and the man beside her . " Casinder ? " The zjarn from Pridicum . Of course ! It was two years since the man 's visit , but Tamborel would not forget those chimes . He gazed up at the twin heyn clusters whirling slowly now around his cot . What was everybody doing here ? And why was he in bed ? The touch of cool cup to his lips drove the question from his mind . He drank long , gulping drafts , so greedily that he ended in a fit of coughing , spilling water down his front . He pushed away the cup and closed his eyes . Why did he feel so weak ? He began to feel frightened . " What 's wrong ? " Eleyna wiped his brow . " Nothing  --  now . Is that not right , Yornwey ? " " You speak true , Eleyna , " Yornwey agreed . " Your boy is back to stay . " Tamborel looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anywhere . Casinder spoke . " I shall go . One faleyn will do it now . But keep his shutter closed , Eleyna . He 'll need to take light slowly , after so long . " " Yornwey , Casinder , " Hwyllum said . " We can never thank you enough for returning our son . He could not have made it alone . " " Oh , I do n't know , " Casinder answered . " He 's a stubborn one . You should be proud of him . " " Oh , we are , " Hwyllum declared fervently . " Hush , " Yornwey warned . " His eyes are dosed . Let  | us not disturb him . " The voices faded , and the chimes . Tamborel lay , wanting to call them back , but unable even to reopen his eyes . They said he 'd been away . But where ? Meynoc boasted of a really big escapade , once . He 'd stayed out all night , he said , and hurt his leg falling from a tree . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing  --  would he ? He shook his head , trying to recall . The next day , Eleyna let Tamborel up , but not out of his room . " You 've slept for days , your legs are weak . But you 'll pick up again in no time . " " Slept ? For days ? " Tamborel had never heard of such a thing . " You . . . had an accident , Tam'shu . " " Accident ? " " You do n't remember still ? " Eleyna was eyeing him closely . " Anything  --  or anyone ? " " No , no . What happened ? " " I ca n't say now . " " But why ? " Tamborel persisted . " It was my accident , Mamma . " " No one may speak of it at this time . Look on the bright side : you 'll be out the house and through the gate before you know it . " But she did n't let him out for a full week more and then only to go with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stared . " Mamma , why do they all look at me ? "  | Eleyna put her arm around him . " They 're glad to see you better . See , Mistress Bider hails you . Wave back , Tam'shu . " " But why ? " He 'd never had such attention , even after the moldy fever . Eleyna 's arm tightened about his shoulders . " Here , you 've gone quite pale . Do you want to stop and rest ? " Tamborel shook his head . He wanted to turn back home , away from all those eyes . Or , better still , find someone who would tell him what this was all about . He wriggled free . " Can I go look for Meynoc ? Say yes , Mamma . " Eleyna shook her head . " You heard what Yornwey said . " " But I ? " " Nay . " Eleyna 's voice went sharp . " There 'll be no more argument today . Now , here 's the well . You want to help let down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meynoc with the other boys , standing by his house . " Meynoc ! " The boys fell silent . Meynoc waved , and started toward him . But then the next minute , for no reason Tamborel could see , he turned tail and ran inside his gate , the others at his heels . Tamborel watched him go , dismayed . " Why did Meynoc run from me , Mamma ? " Eleyna , intent upon the pail , did not turn around . " Rufina must have called him in , Tam'shu . " The pail  | clanked against the well side , hit the bottom with a splash . Now she turned to him , her face concerned . " Oh dear . You look ashen . Sit , there 's a good boy , and I 'll turn the wheel by myself . " Tamborel perched obediently on the well sill while Eleyna cranked up the brimming bucket . He 'd made no mistake . Meynoc had seen him , had come toward him , then had run as if avoiding him . And even Eleyna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pail and set it down beside him , Mistress Bider bustled up , swinging an empty one . " Good day , Eleyna , " she said , as though they 'd never just passed in the street . " How are we , Tamborel ? " " He 's much better , thank you , Mistress Bider , " Eleyna said quickly . The woman looked him over . " The scars do n't show . You must be glad . " " Please ! " Eleyna seized up the bucket , slopping water all over . " Come , Tam'shu . " She took his arm and hustled him away , her heynim bobbing wildly . Tamborel stumbled along beside her , much confused . He put a hand to his cheek . " What did Mistress Bider mean , scars ? " Eleyna scowled . " Not now , Tam'shu , " she answered , her tone so sharp that Tamborel dared not press her further . That night , after dinner , Hwyllum announced that he and Eleyna were off to a plenary assembly .  | " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Plenary assemblies were routine public meetings , held twice yearly in the Farmer 's Hall to set sowing and harvest dates , and also seed and grain prices . So this extra assembly , coming in between , was for another reason  --  and an exceptional one to bring out the entire village at the height of the harvest when folk kept early nights ! " Never you mind , my boy , " Hwyllum said . They put him to bed , stood over him , looking down severely . " Now be good , Tam'shu , " Eleyna cautioned . " And do n't leave the house , " warned Hwyllum . " Yes , Mamma ; no , Pappa . " Tamborel looked from one to the other . Something was up , but no use asking what . The moment they were out , Tamborel was at his saraba , peering through the slats . It was n't easy , his saraba affording only a slice of street between houses . But he did glimpse his parents as they passed , joining other folk headed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could it be because of him ? Half a summer lost ! It was as if he 'd fallen into a shadow pit . Since the day of his awaking , everyone had acted strangely toward him , even Hwyllum and Eleyna . He put his hands to the sides of his head and pressed . Oh , if he could only recall ... Wincing , Tamborel removed his hands . The left side of his head felt tender . He poked about gingerly , found a sore spot in the hollow just behind his temple . lie rubbed the spot , and found a patch of stubble .  | Mystified , Tamborel ran into his parents ' bedchamber and stood before the mirror . Reaching up on tiptoe , he turned his head sideways then with his free hand , he parted his locks , craning this way and that . Tamborel cried out . Over the tender spot , his hair was little more than fuzz . Why , someone had shaved his scalp ! He let go his curls , smoothing them into place . Could n't see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He felt around the rest of his skull and located two more such spots , one up near the crown , the second at the nape . Three sore places on his skull ! Tamborel pulled absently at the fine hair tufts , remembering Mistress Bider . The scars don ' t show . You must be glad . Eleyna had been so angry . She had n't wanted Tamborel to hear about the scars . Why not ? Tamborel could understand Hwyllum 's silence , for that was Pappa 's way . But Eleyna ? " She always tells me , " he said aloud . " Even when she 's not supposed to . " The scars , his long sleep , the gap in his memory : everyone in Fahwyll knew why  --  but him . Even Meynoc and the other boys . That was why they 'd dodged him that afternoon . Was it ... something bad ? Tamborel grew anxious , then angry . " They have no right ! " He could not , would not wait another minute to know the truth ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street , making for the Farmer 's Hall .  | Reaching the Y-fork , Tamborel paused by the well to catch his breath , a mistake . With the pause came second thoughts . He was supposed to be in bed , he 'd promised to be good . He glanced back toward his house , doubtfully , then peered along the left arm of the fork toward the low , dark mass of the meeting hall blocking its end . His face set . Enough . He must know the truth about his scars , and his mysterious accident  --  now ! He pressed on with new resolve until he reached the hall with its low , wide entrance arch and lighted sarabas to either side . There , he stopped . So many people : the whole village ! He could n't just march in.  | Everyone would turn and stare , and Mamma and Pappa would be angry at his disobedience . Tamborel went to the nearest saraba . Standing on tiptoe , he grasped the sill and leaned in toward the open shutter slats . Silver moon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his face , smelling of lamp oil and sweat , and the scented sachets that women tucked inside their bodices . The place was jammed : folk leaned against the walls , fanning themselves and mopping their brows . Above their heads their clusters bobbed and jingled agitatedly over the buzz of talk . On a far dais , facing Tamborel , Bombrul and Rufina sat side by side , stiff-backed . With them  --  Hwyllum and Eleyna , and between the couples , Yornwey . In front of them , Bennoc stood mopping his red face . " That child could wreck us all . We must save ourselves at any cost . The good of all outweighs the ill to one . " The man sounded wrought up , unlike his usual bluff and cheery self . " Oh ! " Rufina clapped a kerchief to her mouth . Bombrul leapt up angrily . " Ill ? That is what you 'd call putting out our baby 's eyes and puncturing her ears ? What you propose is little short of murder ! " " Speaking of murder , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so long to convene this meeting . If young Tamborel had died , yon miss would be standing here accused of that , exactly . And we 'd be talking of a remedy much stronger than stopping eyes and ears . "  | " Why , you ? " Bombrul drew back his great fist and for a moment a fight seemed certain . But then Hwyllum stood and put himself between them , whispering in Bombrul 's ear , until , slowly , the man lowered himself back onto his seat . Tamborel took fresh hold on the sill , and , wedging his toes in a wall crack , pressed his nose to the shutters just as Hwyllum spoke up aloud . " Whether Tamborel had died , or had been hurt beyond repair , how could you , Bennoc , who tune a faleyn , even think to harm a child ? To destroy the sight and hearing of an innocent baby ! Who knows what such an act might bring upon our heads ! " Bennoc turned on Hwyllum angrily . " That innocent baby almost killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unless we stop her . What I say we should do beats any other idea proposed this night . " Yornwey stood up . " Fear stirs rash words . We must view the situation calmly . " She stepped between the two men , and addressed the hall . " Many of you here have thus far spoken of anger and fear at Caidrun 's extraordinary command over heynim . But look at it this way : through it , she may one day attain high honor , even in the Hon'faleyn itself . If rightly nurtured , her gift could bring great credit and renown to us here in Fahwyll . " Yet , having seen the harm that Caidrun 's gift can do while she is yet too young to wield it , I agree that we must find a way to block her ? "  | Bombrul was back on his feet , Rufina beside him . A clamor broke out , people shouting and waving wildly toward the dais . Tamborel lost his grip and slithered to the ground . Caidrun ? He rubbed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's baby sister . What was this frightening talk about stopping her eyes and ears ? He grasped the sill anew and shimmied back up the wall . Everyone was down again , except for Yornwey . " As I was saying , we must find a way to block Caidrun 's sight and hear-ing  --  but without harming her permanently . I urge you again : think of the future ! Look to the day when she works great good and brings us glory ! " " So what do you propose , zjarn ? " Bennoc demanded . " Never mind Yornwey ! " Mother Turner called out from across the hall . " Let the mother speak ! " " Very well . " Yornwey nodded . " Rufina ? " Rufina leaned forward in her seat and reached for Bombrul 's hand . " I 'm that upset to hear you talk of our Caidrun in such a way .... " Tamborel frowned . What was she saying ? She spoke so low that he could scarcely hear her . He hunched up his shoulders , leaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his ear against the shutter . " ... I never would have thought it  --  though , now I recall as folk said she nearly killed me even afore she was born . Poison in the blood . But ' twere n't her fault . Do n't forget , she nearly died as well , the precious little innocent . "  | " The subject is , how to keep her from doing further harm , " Bennoc said . " Easy , " Rufina said . " You need n't talk of maiming . I can make her a helmet to block her ears . If she do n't hear heynim , she 'll not snag them . " " What about her eyes ? She 'd still be able to see ! " someone shouted . " True , " Yornwey agreed . " So we 'll add a visor for when the child goes out . As for in the house , since Caidrun worries at her parents ' heynim " ? the zjarn turned to Bombrul and Rufina ? " she must keep to her room with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you must start to train her straight away not to snag . Do you agree ? " " Aye . I suppose , " Bombrul conceded heavily . Rufina only nodded . " Then go , and good luck to you . I , for one , do n't envy you your task . " " Nor do I , " said a woman in the back row , Tamborel heard her distinctly . " Such trouble as the child is going to be . ' T were better she had died . " Everybody stood . The meeting was over . Stunned , Tamborel slid to the ground . What was all this dreadful talk about Meynoc 's baby sister ? Whatever had she done ? As folk streamed out into the night , Tamborel pushed his way in and hurried to the dais . Eleyna was standing with her arms about Rufina when she saw him . " Tamborel ! " " I bound sore places ! Here , here , and here . " He  | touched his fingers to the three bald spots in turn , rubbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are these the scars Mistress Bider meant ? " " Young man , " Hwyllum said severely . " Did we not expressly tell you to stay abed ? Did you not say that we could trust you ? " " That was before , " Tamborel said . " Please , Pappa . " Eleyna crouched , taking Tamborel 's hands in hers . " Yes , they 're the scars , Tam'shu . We could n't say before tonight because others are con-cerned . " " Caidy , you mean ? " " Caidrun ? You 've remembered her ? " Tamborel shook his head . " I heard through the saraba . " " Heard what ? What did you hear ? " Eleyna asked sharply . Tamborel did n't answer , frightened by her tone . He thought back to the last time he 'd seen the baby . Was it at her naming ? Ye .. . es , vaguely , come to think . He 'd held her heyn box . He frowned , something else picking at his mind 's edge . That naming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caidy 's anniversary . " " No , Tam'shu . You were there . " Eleyna looked at him gravely , then to Rufina and Bombrul . " In fact , that 's where you had your , your accident . " " It were no accident . " Bombrul spoke up . " But for you , our Caidrun would be dead , or badly hurt , at  | least . You saved her , lad , just as your pappa saved her before . You are a hero , just like him . " " I am ? " Tamborel stared . " But what did I do ? " Bombrul explained how Caidrun had found the heyn box , how the heyn had escaped , how she had pulled not only that one to her , but others , from every direction . " There she was , snagging heynim like slingshot . You were so quick ; you saw the danger , while we stood stiff as scarecrows . You pushed her down and threw yourself atop her ? " " And the heynim struck you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was all banged up . But the back of your head took the brunt of them . Your scalp was all laid open and losing so much blood ? " " Eleyna , " Hwyllum warned . " Yornwey had to shave off your beautiful curls to stitch you up . But you would n't awaken for one whole week . You know the rest , Tam'shu . " " What about Caidy ? Was she hurt , too ? " Eleyna shook her head . " No , Tam'shu . You shielded her . Tamborel shuddered , recalling the talk at the meeting . That Bennoc ! Ugly man ! He had a sudden memory of Caidrun looking up at him from her pen , and him shaking the heyn box by her ear . She had known it at once , he remembered the joy in her big , blue eyes . " Caidy is so very special . How could Bennoc want her deaf and blind ! " Tamborel clenched his fists . " I always thought he was so good and grand ,  | tuning his faleyn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never like him now , never ! " He turned on Rufina . " Will you really keep Caidy shut away like that ? " Rufina nodded slowly . " We must , Tamborel . " " But you ca n't ! She must hear chiming while she 's growing , or you 'll cripple her anyway ! " " That does it ! " Hwyllum grabbed Tamborel 's shoulder and began to march him away . Rufina called them back . " Wait ! He 's right . " She moved forward , taking Tamborel by the hand . " It 's not forever . She 'll not sutler much , I promise you . " Tamborel pulled free , stepping away . The baby 's own mother  --  did she not realize ? Why , Caidy might never get back what she lost ! Hwyllum moved in . " On our way , then . Good night , Rufina . Till the morning , Bombrul , " he said , and marched Tamborel away . They passed under the hall saba , emerging into the cool night . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be protected from herself . " " But , Pappa , Bennoc wanted to actually blind and deafen her for real ! " " You think we 'd have allowed it , your Mamma , Rufina , Bombrul , Cerie , Yornwey , and I ? " " But why ? " " People were afraid . They had to vent their feelings . " " But how long must she be shut off like that , Pappa ? "  | " Until she is old enough to know better . " " But that could be years ! " ' T were better she had died .... Hwyllum checked his stride . " You think Rufina and Bombrul do not know this ? That they do n't care ? And I , Caidrun 's father-mentor ? She 's like a daughter to me . But you 're my true child , my son , my own flesh and blood , and dearer to me by far . She nearly killed you , Tamborel . " His voice dried up . " She did n't mean to , Pappa . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you lay near dead because of what she did . Can you imagine what your Mamma and I went through , watching by your bed ? Oh , the blood , and those terrible gashes , and Yornwey sewing you up like a flour sack ! " Hwyllum seized Tamborel and hugged him , hard . Then , as suddenly , he released him , gave him a little push . " Hark at me : you have me going on like your mamma ! Come on , let 's get you off to bed ! " 72 7 3  | Next morning , Tamborel ran into the kitchen . " Mamma , I know what to do . You must take Caidy to Silwender ! " Eleyna pointed to the breakfast table . " Sit you down , Tam'shu . " " He 'll fix her , " Tamborel went on in a rush . " He must : it was all his doing in the first place . " " Oh ? " Eleyna set a bowl before him . " She felt his power before she was born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we do n't know that , " Eleyna said . " But there was talk last night of sending for the High Zjarn . " She shook her head . " We ca n't , though . Not right now , anyway . "  | " But why ? " " The cost , Tam'shu . " Cost ? " Mamma , I do n't understand . " Eleyna propped her elbows on the table . " Silwender 's fee is high  --  too high for ordinary folk like us . Every family in Fahwyll dipped deep into its purse to meet his last one . " " You mean  --  the zjarns take money ? " " But of course . " " Yornwey too ? " Eleyna nodded . " How else would she live , but by her work , just as we live by growing grain ? Zjarns cost , Tam'shu . And better zjarns cost more . " Tamborel cast around for straws . " He might fix Caidy for less  --  or for nothing , once we explain . He 'll surely remember her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking exactly , " Eleyna replied . " I said , ' Take Caidrun to Minavar and trust to luck . ' But Bombrul and Rufina were afraid , and many spoke against it . Even Yornwey said it might be wise to wait a year or two . " " A year or two ! " Tamborel banged down his spoon . " Caidy must n't be without the chimes one day , ca n't they see that ? " He jumped up and made for the saba . " Tam'shu ! Where are you going ? " Eleyna demanded sharply . " To Rufina 's ! " " Just you come back here ! " Eleyna cried . " You go nowhere today . " 74 75  | " But I must ? " " That is my last word . " Tamborel stayed in that day , and for the week thereafter . Because he was not yet quite recovered , Eleyna said . But it was really on account of his having gone to the assembly , and also to keep him from Rufina 's until things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he hung around the saba , gazing out , thinking of Caidrun , wondering if the hateful helmet was yet made , and if she wore it already . Tamborel tried to picture how it felt , how she would get around with it on . He covered his ears , and at once the jingle of Eleyna 's heynim was gone to a wash of toneless buzz . He squeezed his eyes shut , and at once the world turned dark . Keeping his eyes closed , he groped his way around the house , bumping into furniture and banging his head . Poor Caidy . All that week , Tamborel pleaded to be let out , but Eleyna stayed firm . Resigned , he helped with the summertime fight against the grit that blew in under the entrance arch and through the saraba slats . He made his bed , dried dishes , washed vegetables , and kept the broth pot stirred . On the sixth day , Eleyna went to market , leaving Tamborel behind . " Why ca n't I go with you ? " he protested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the well , her dragging him home , spilling water all the way .  | She was not gone long . " Did you see Rufina ? Has Caidy got that horrible helmet yet ? " he called , the moment Eleyna turned onto the front path . " I do not know , Tam'shu . " Eleyna set her basket on the kitchen table . " I did not see Rufina , I have n't seen her since the village meeting . And I spoke to no one else . " In the afternoon , Tamborel played table stones with Eleyna , he throwing the highest score . Then they drew guessing puzzles in the sand tray . With the pointed stick , Tamborel drew a circle slashed horizontally . Under the slash , he made a small , round dot . " I give up , you win this one , Tam'shu , " Eleyna conceded . " What is it ? " " Caidy 's face with the helmet on , " he said , erasing the lines with savage strokes . He pictured Caidrun alone in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? he wondered . And to a baby who could n't possibly understand ! " I 'd cry and yell until I was so sick they 'd have to let me out ! " The moment he was free , he 'd run to Rufina 's house and visit with Caidy : why not ? Unlike the grownups , he had no heyn for her to snag ! But on his first day out , Eleyna took him to watch lBennoc and Throm tune their faleyn to the harvesting . The whole village was gathered there , lining the margins of the fields , straggling all the way back to the meadow where the dead folk lay . The men , who 76 77 78 had been there since sunup , left their labors to join their families . Tamborel shaded his eyes , searching for Bombrul and Rufina . There , way over , out of reach . Meynoc stood beside them , no sign of Caidrun , of course . They had left her home , locked up . Eleyna took his hand . " There 's your pappa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And , look , Throm and Bennoc are ready to begin . " Trailing their heynim clusters , the two men entered the fields and began to circle them in opposite directions . Even at a distance , Tamborel could hear the twin faleyn plainly , and " see " their colors with his inner eye . He looked with loathing to where Bennoc tuned his harmonies for fair skies . Last year , he 'd thought the man 's faleyn so wondrous , had longed to be grown-up and in his shoes . But now those harmonies sounded thin and weak . Weak sound , weak sky , thought Tamborel . He would himself have tuned the faleyn to a deeper blue ; the clear , true blue of af-ternoon  --  the color of Caidy 's eyes . " Bennoc 's faleyn is shallow , " Tamborel muttered . " So is he . Just wait till I am old enough to snag . I 'll show him what a sky faleyn should sound like . " " Look , Tam'shu : now Throm draws near , " Eleyna said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep their faleyn distinct ? " Throm 's faleyn , tuned to ripen the grain , was golden with a tinge of brass . Tamborel closed his eyes , and , tuning out the brass , focused on the gold , savor-  | ing the minute shift of intervals as the melodies progressed . . . . In the faleyn 's spell , he saw bright , golden grain ears waving in the warm wind soft as Eleyna 's long , fine hair . Sweet , plump seed to replenish the silos  --  and the village coffers . Last year , at harvesting , Tamborel had come into the fields with Meynoc and the rest when the men were gone . They 'd played hide-and-go-seek , then stuffed themselves with fistfuls of fat grain until they were sick , although it was forbidden to touch it . He stood now , almost tasting hard , dry seed case in his mouth and moist sap sugary as nectar bursting on his tongue ... . " It is over , Tam'shu . Come . " Tamborel opened his eyes , coming back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home between the fields , talking and glancing to the clear blue skies . He let out a long , deep sigh . Eleyna took his hand . " You 're not tired ? You did n't get too much sun ? " Tamborel shook his head . Eleyna smiled up at Hwyllum . " It was wonderful , was n't it , Pappa ? Every year 's the same ! " Tamborel walked on between his parents , saying nothing . The spell was broken . Every year was not the same . This year there was Caidy , shut away , as good as blind and deaf . Tomorrow , he resolved , he 'd go to Rufina 's house , whatever Eleyna said ! 78 7v  | The very next day Eleyna took Tamborel to Rufina 's house herself . Rufina looked tired and harassed . " Caidrun 's taking a nap . " " Then may we wait ? We came especially to see her , " Eleyna said . Rufina looked cheered . " Oh , please . She should be waking shortly . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She 's so fretful , I have n't had a moment to myself . And no one 's been by , until you . " The women went into the kitchen . Tamborel went along to Caidrun 's room , but he could not see inside . The archway lattice was gone and  | in its place , a monsoon shutter . Used only to seal outer sabas in the rainy season , the things were so thick and solid that they blocked the sound of wind and rain at the height of any storm . Tamborel put his ear to the shutter and , naturally , heard nothing . He wandered to the kitchen , where the women were seated at the table . Rufina was crying , Eleyna 's arm around her shoulder . " There , now , it 's not your fault , Rufina . " " But she 's taking it so hard , " Rufina sobbed . " Such a happy little soul as she used to be . Now all she does is cry  --  and the tantrums ! " Rufina 's heynim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other . Their fault , could n't they see ? If it were n't for them , Caidrun would not have to suffer . " I 'd do anything to let her run around the house , " Rufina went on . " You can , and I know how , " Tamborel declared . " Hush , Tam'shu , " Eleyna said . " Go play outside . " " But , Mamma , I do ! " Tamborel looked from one to the other earnestly . " You just stow your heynim when Caidy 's by . And when folk visit  --  they can stow their heynim , too . " " Stow heynim ? " Rufina looked doubtful . " But no one has ever ... " " In boxes , " Tamborel went on doggedly . " Like Caidy 's , only bigger . " Rufina turned to Eleyna . " What do you think ? " Ihleyna nodded slowly . " It 's ... worth a try . " Rufina  | took up the thought . " We 'd have to make changes ? big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It will be dark in here , and hot , and stuffy , and such a change from being open to the summer , but if there 's a chance our Caidrun would be happier ... I 'll talk to Bombrul tonight . " For an hour more , Eleyna and Rufina sat , talking over plans to change the house , no sign of Caidrun . Then it was time to go . " But I want to see Caidy ! " " Tomorrow , Tam'shu , all right ? " Eleyna said , though in the end she did not let him visit for four days after . Bombrul was enclosing his saba with a lean-to porch , working in the evenings with Hwyllum and other volunteers . A closed-in entrance arch ! It was the talk of the village ! Five days later , when the work was done , Eleyna took Tamborel on a second visit . At the sight of the porch , they came to a halt . The tiny lean-to stuck out from the house bizarrely ; a narrow box with sloping roof , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side , and all around the house , the sarabas were sealed also with heavy storm shields . All this , thought Tamborel , when all they had to do was take Caidy to Silwender ! Eleyna banged on the iron shutter . As they waited for Rufina to come , she shifted her feet , looking discomfited . Tamborel eyed her sideways , wondering why . After a few minutes , Rufina hauled the heavy shutter aside and let them in . At first , Tamborel could see nothing . But as he adjusted to the gloom , he saw  | that behind Rufina the regular saba lattice was still in place , closing off the porch from the house , turning the area into a tiny vestibule . Beyond the lattice , the middle-room was lit with lamps , just as in the monsoon season . Hard to believe it was noon , thought Tamborel . And the height of summer . He watched Eleyna pluck her heynim down and set them carefully in a box , seeing now the reason for her unease . Inside , the monsoon-like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uneasily . It felt odd , and not very pleasant , without the heynim 's jingle . And the women looked strangely bereft without their clusters . Rufina went to fetch Caidrun . Tamborel waited by the middle room archway , watching for her to come up the passage . Eleyna called out behind him . " Do you remember playing with her before ? Is it coming back , Tam'shu ? " Tamborel nodded slowly , staring up the passageway past Rufina 's bedroom arch to Caidrun 's chamber at the end . " Some , Mamma . I remember the two of us chasing up and down this passageway . And Caidy cuddling a doll . And ? " Something about a heyn . " And Caidy 's heyn in a little box . " He 'd done something had with it , though he could n't quite remember what . Rufina emerged , Caidrun in her arms . At the sight of Caidrun 's face , Tamborel drew in his breath . Oh , the pallor of her cheeks ! The dark and puffy smudges underneath her blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He reached out toward her . " Caidy . You 've grown . "  | Caidrun turned her face away , burrowing into Rufina 's shoulder . He moved around to face her . " Caidy  --  it 's me , Bret . " To his horror , she began to cry . Tamborel turned to Eleyna in distress . " She does n't know me . " That hurt . For although he 'd forgotten times they 'd shared , his feeling for Caidrun herself was strong and clear as ever . " She knows you , Tam'shu . All too well . " " How do you mean , Mamma ? " Rufina walked Caidrun about the room , jigging her up and down , stroking her head , and soothing her ear with gentle words . " You mean the accident ? You told me she was n't hurt . " " She was n't , bodily . But she got a bad fright . There was quite a to-do after you went down : shouting and goings-on . Give her time . " " Let go ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set down . " Ignore her , Tamborel , " Rufina advised , setting Caidrun to the floor . " Let her come to you . " Freed , Caidrun ran around the room , picking up things and hurling them aside , cutting a swath . " She seems to have gotten out on the wrong side , " Eleyna said lightly . " That 's normal these days , " Rufina answered . " All we 've done to make life easier is still not enough . She misses the sunlight . " And the chimes , thought Tamborel . He missed  | them , too , even after this short while . The total absence of familiar , reassuring sound made him feel most uneasy , even anxious . He well remembered how much they 'd meant to Caidrun . She must be going crazy ! Caidrun went to the saba lattice and rattled it , still ignoring her visitors . " Out ! Out ! " she commanded . " I 'll take her , " Tamborel volunteered quickly . " In the baby cart . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Tomorrow , then ? I 'd wheel her to the brook . That 's well clear of the fields . And Meynoc could come , too . Please , Rufina ? " " Oh , Tamborel . You 're such a kind boy . But you 're way too young to take her alone . Even with Meynoc . " Tamborel drew himself up . " I 'm nearly eight . " " I 'll go with him , " Eleyna said quickly , then glanced upward . " I  --  I 'll leave my heynim home . Wo n't hurt , I suppose , just for a short while . " Rufina beamed . " You 'd do that ? We 'll all go , then . Caidrun can wear her helmet , and we 'll take it off once she 's out of harm 's way . " She gathered Caidrun up and smothered her with kisses . " Oh , my dearest little one ? we 'll make you happy somehow , wait and see ! " Around noon the next day , Eleyna filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her heynim in a box , she set it on the mantel shelf . At the saba , she hesitated , looking most unhappy . 84 H5  | " You do n't have to leave them behind altogether , Mamma . Bring them in the basket . " " But Caidrun will hear them when she takes her helmet off , Tam'shu . " " Not if you leave your box in Rufina 's porch . " " But it hardly seems worth it , for just that little way . " Nevertheless , Eleyna ran back , took down the box and slipped it inside the basket . " Let 's go . " At last , the two of them stepped out into the street . Mistress Bider was at her gate , little Tancey peeping from behind . She stared at the space above Eleyna 's head . " Well , I never ! " " Going to Rulina 's , are you ? " Mother Turner came out to meet them . " Good for you . How is the little one ? " Tamborel strode ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting by the saba lattice . " Brel ! " The moment the lattice was open , she grabbed his sleeve and towed him inside . Just like the old days , thought Tamborel , his spirits lifting . She 'd come around to him at last ! " Come , Caidrun . We 're going on a picnic ! " Rufina scooped Caidrun up . Caidrun scowled . " No , " she said . " No , no , no . " The helmet was made of the coarse brown stuff the men wore in the fields , and thickly padded . There were two earflaps buttoned back , and a rolled up visor . As Rufina tried to slip it on , Caidrun kicked and fought , squalling loudly . The helmet covered her  | brow and half her cheeks , also . As Rufina tied the drawstring knots , Caidrun struggled . " Off ! Off ! " Rufina pressed on grimly , fastening the earflaps under Caidrun 's chin . Then she rolled down the visor , covering the wide blue eyes . " You ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's cruel ! " " Only till we 're away from everyone , " Rufina called loudly over Caidrun 's protests . " Let 's go , quick ! " They set out , along the street . Rufina carried Caidrun in her arms , Tamborel pushed the empty baby cart , while Eleyna toted the loaded basket . People stared as they hurried along , but no one spoke to them . Propelled by Caidrun 's squalling , they hurried to the end of the street , and away from the fields to the brook . There , Eleyna spread out the picnic things while Rufina removed the helmet . Caidrun stopped her racket instantly , and , blinking in the bright sunshine , ran to the edge of the brook , looking down . " Watch her , Tamborel , " Eleyna called . Not that there was much danger , for the brook was only inches deep there , rippling over smooth , round stones . Minnows started at Caidrun 's shadow , making her squeal , this time with delight . Tamborel picked up a pebble and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catching the dart of the fish , Caidrun jumped up and down , laughing and clapping her hands . Tamborel handed her a pebble . " Here , Caidy . You throw one , too . "  | Caidrun stretched out her arm and the pebble plopped into the current . " ' Gain , Brel ! ' Gain ! " she cried . Her cheeks were flushed , her clear blue eyes bright with excitement . Tamborel sighed with satis-faction . They had to come again . Perhaps if he waited , picked his moment , they might let him bring Caidrun here tomorrow after all ... .  | After that , Rufina and Eleyna took Caidrun out as often as Tamborel could persuade them . " She 's more like her old self again , Tamborel . And so glad to be about , she does n't seem to mind the helmet as much , " Rufina said . Eleyna was not so satisfied . " All these walks and picnics : the house is getting into such a sorry state . I wish Rufina would go out on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stares and comments without Eleyna . " I could take Caidy out alone , " Tamborel suggested . " I know what to do . Ask Rufina , please ? " They sent him on a trial trip , wheeling Caidrun  | nonstop to the brook and back  --  a safe enough outing through fallow meadow . He pushed her in little spurts , then pulling up , making Caidrun squeal and beg for more . Then he rushed her back at breakneck speed to keep her mind off her helmet . After a few more such trips , Rufina showed him how to knot and unknot the helmet laces . Then carne the biggest test of all . Rufina set Caidrun before him . " Tamborel 's fitting your helmet today . If you let him , he 'll wheel you to the brook . He 'll take it off there and put it back on when it 's time to come home . " She handed the helmet to Tamborel . " Here . See what she does . " With trembling fingers , Tamborel set the thing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't fuss , Caidy . To his relief and Rufina 's amazement , Caidrun suffered him to close the flaps and knot the strings the way he 'd been shown . She clung to him without demur as he carried her out and set her in the baby cart . They were off . As usual , Tamborel ran , bumping over ruts and stones . There , he carefully undid the knots and  --  oh , the look on her face as he raised the helmet and uncovered her eyes ! She stood up , blinking , in the cart and threw her arms about him . " Brel ! " she cried , and they both laughed aloud . He jumped her down and they went splashing in the stony shallows until they were both drenched .  | Then they chased up and down the bank while the shadows lengthened into late afternoon . At last , Tamborel led her back to the cart . Now , he thought , tensing up , the final test . He held up the helmet . " Time to put it back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , promise . " Caidrun sat , unprotesting , while he slipped the helmet back on and tied the straps . She knows , he thought exultantly . No reason they should n't go out every day now ! Afternoons from then on , he wheeled Caidrun to the brook . He threw stones  --  actually managed to skim one  --  and delighted to see her eyes light up , to hear her laugh when the pebble bounced . " You 're so kind , " Rufina said . " And steady , coming day in , day out to give our Caidrun an airing . If only our Meynoc would do half as much ! " Eleyna was not so glad . " Spend so much time with a two-year-old baby ? It 's not natural . You 're not her family , Tam'shu . " " But I am , Mamma , in a way . " " And you 've done nothing else for a week , things you love to do , like fishing . I 'm going to have to speak with your pappa . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ About him , he knew . And it was not good , judging by their serious tone . He went off to sleep , full of misgiving . Next morning , when Tamborel went to break-90 91  | fast , Hwyllum was still there . " Eat up , my boy . You 're going to the field today . " " But , Pappa ! I promised to take Caidy to the brook . " Hwyllum shook his head . " Not this day , Tamborel . And not tomorrow , either . You 're seeing too much of that lass . " " I must take her . She counts on me ! Who else will wheel her out ? " " Rufina . It 's her place , " Hwyllum said firmly . " We 're doing more than our fair share . " " No , we 're not , Pappa . You 're Caidy 's second father , and that makes me her second brother . We should help her more than others do . " Hwyllum 's face darkened . " Are you saying I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his voice . " Listen , your mamma 's right : you should be out doing boyish things , not wheeling out a baby girl . " " But I like to be with Caidy . We have fun together ! " Tamborel met his father 's eyes , read the steely purpose there , and quailed . Still , he tried again . " Let me go just today , please , Pappa . I 'll come with you tomorrow . " " No , Tamborel . You 'll see Caidrun next week . Now eat and get dressed . " " But Rufina ? " " We 'll tell Rufina on the way to work . " " You tell her ! " Tamborel cried , beside himself . " I 'm staying home ! " He ran to his room and sank onto his bed . To have spoken to one 's father so ! He heard  | Hwyllum leave , Eleyna set about her housework . He waited , but she did n't call on him to help , she did n't come near him at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll never understand , he thought grimly . She 'll think that I 've abandoned her . Tamborel kept to himself all that day , and the next , sitting in silence at table , scarcely touching his food , and avoiding his parents ' eyes . But if they cared , they did not show it . Neither did they relent . After five days , Tamborel could stand it no longer . Hwyllum and Eleyna really meant what they said this time , it was clear . So the sooner he came around , the sooner they 'd let him visit Caidrun . The next day , Hwyllum took him to the fields . One week after that , Tamborel stood before Rufina 's porch . Rufina let him in gladly . " Caidrun 's not well . She misses you . " Tamborel took heart . Caidy will welcome me , after all , he thought . But when she saw him , she scowled and turned away . " See , Caidrun , " Rufina said . " Brel 's come to take you out . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brel go home . " " Now , Caidrun , " Rufina said . " Come , let 's get your helmet on . " Caidrun fought and wriggled on Rufina 's lap , resisting all attempts to fit the helmet . Rufina gave up the struggle . " You 'd better go , Tamborel. " 92 93  | Caidrun stopped fighting instantly . " Caidy ride ! " she bawled . Rufina turned to Tamborel , at a loss . " Will you manage ? " Tamborel raced along the path , setting the little cart a-bounce , but Caidrun only clutched the cart sides grimly . At the brook , she tore at the helmet . " Off ! Off ! " Tamborel undid Rufina 's careful knots , releasing Caidrun 's wiry mop . He scooped up a handful of stones , threw the first , then handed one to Caidrun . " Now you , Caidy , " he said . She drew back her small fist and , to his consternation , hurled the stone at him ! Of course , she let it go all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Tamborel was deeply hurt . " I 'm sorry I did n't come , Caidy , " he said . " I had to help my pappa in the fields . " Casting around for some way to cheer her up , he recalled how she 'd liked his singing . " Caidy , do you remember this ? One ear of grain , two ears of grain , three and another make four ? ' " Caidrun turned away with a flourish . He sighed , gazing at the back of her head , the stiff set of her shoulders . Oh , if only he were seventeen instead of seven : he 'd share his heynim with her , even with them in a box ! He had a flash of her from long ago , face upturned , demanding . Oosiks , Brel ! Oosiks ! What to do ? He had no heynim to shake , but . . . He could try to sing their notes . Tamborel began to hum , a snatch from Silwender 's chiming the night he 'd lain beneath Rufina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he 'd not forgotten it entirely , either . It came into his mind sometimes , when he was going off to sleep . He hummed it once , softly , tentatively , then , gathering confidence , he repeated it more loudly , adjusting a couple of notes . That got Caidrun 's attention , all right . She grasped his jacket and tugged . " Moosic , Brel , moosic ! " " You want more ? " Tamborel smiled . " Well , let 's see : here are some notes from Yornwey 's cluster . " Instead of humming this time , he sang out the notes in clear , bell-like 0 's : " 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , O. " He smiled . " Are n't they lovely ? Only Yornwey has those notes , you know . Now these are the ones in my mamma 's cluster : listen . " Tamborel intoned the half-dozen high , thin notes . " Of course , my singing does n't sound a bit like chimes , but it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jumped up and down waving her arms . " More , Brel , more . " Tamborel sang more clusters , naming each one , until , tiring at last , Caidrun was off and running along the bank . But her humor was restored . They played on peaceably until it was time to go , but the moment Tamborel took up the helmet , Caidrun squealed and ran . Tamborel caught her , but he could not get the helmet on . " Listen , " he yelled at last . " If you do n't let me put this thing back on , they 'll never let us out again ! "  | Caidrun quit her squalls abruptly , and held still while Tamborel tied on the helmet . But as he made to roll down the visor , he stopped . After all his effort , Caidrun 's face was stiff and set again . Surely it would n't hurt to leave off the helmet until they were closer to home ? He trudged along , pushing the cart before him , Caidrun facing front , fixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dark and silent house waiting to imprison her . Poor Caidy . He resolved to sing to her every day from now on . But that was no substitute for hearing true heynim . How long , before she suffered lasting harm ? He pushed on , lost in anxious thought , until suddenly , Caidrun ex-claimed . Coming toward them were several village wives , talking and not looking where they were going . Their heynim ! While Caidrun might not hear , she could surely see them  --  and had ! Tamborel ran around to cover Caidrun 's eyes  --  too late . One of the women cried out as a pair of heynim detached from her cluster and floated toward the cart . " Caidy  --  no ! " Tamborel yanked Caidrun 's visor down , grabbed the cart handles and ran . The errant heynim floated back to their owner , too late . " There 's that miss , " someone called . " What 's Rufina thinking of ? Is that Eleyna 's boy ? He 's far too young to mind the child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | hind . His face burned , his breath came short , his blood was salty in his throat . Not true ! Not true ! Of all the luck ! Deaf to Caidrun 's squalling , he pressed on toward Rufina 's . He handed Caidrun over in the porch and hurried home , not stopping to explain . The minute Hwyllum got home Tamborel was called out . " I meant no harm . Nobody ever goes that way , " he mumbled . Only Meynoc and the rest  --  and not even them right now , for they were helping with the harvest . As for the women , he 'd never seen them at the brook before . Eleyna and Hwyllum exchanged glances . " There , " Eleyna said , putting her arm around him . " We do n't blame you , eh , Pappa ? " Hwyllum nodded . " But this afternoon has stirred up more strong talk about Caidrun . " " So many have offered to help mind Caidrun now , " Eleyna went on . " Yornwey , and Cerie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , of course . We 're taking turns to wheel Caidrun out every day . Your pappa and Bombrul , too , when they can . So , you see , good has come of it , after all , Tam'shu . " She enveloped him in a warm embrace . " And everybody says how kind you 've been , helping out like that . " Tamborel could hardly speak . " Do I take turns , too ? " Eleyna looked to Hwyllum . Hwyllum nodded . " You can go to Rufina 's once a week to play with Caidrun  --  when you 're not helping me , like . And 96 97  | once in a while take her to the brook with Mamma and me , maybe . " Tamborel fled to his room and huddled on his bed . All those people , meddling in Caidy 's life . And how would he sing to her every day now ? How would he ever sing to her again with someone always listening in !  | Harvesting came and went . Tamborel worked hard in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his parents saw how he had grown , they 'd relent and let things be as they were . Meantime , no more outings to the minnow brook : he had to make do with the weekly visit to Rufina 's . There , it was like treading prickly grain stubble barefoot . So that Caidrun could roam free without her helmet , Rufina stowed her heynim on the porch . This left her edgy and quick-tongued , unlike her usual , even-tempered self . Some days , Caidrun was also moody and difficult and nothing could please her . Then , Tamborel wondered why he went at all . One morning , they both turned on him together .  | " Sing , Brel . Caidy want Brel to sing . " Her pale face was tilted up at him , pinched , demanding . Rufina came out of the kitchen . " You 're going to sing , Tamborel ? " She perched on a nearby chair . " How she loves that . Go on . " Tamborel felt the color rush to his face . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mumbled . Caidrun began to fuss . " Please , " Rufina said . " She 's getting upset , Tamborel . " " Oh , well . " He began the chant . " One ear of grain , two ears of grain , three and another make four ? " Caidrun cut him off . " No , no , no ! Brel sing moosic ! " Rufina turned to him , perplexed . " What does she mean , music ? " Tamborel shook his head . But he knew right enough . She wanted him to sing the heyn notes again . But he dared not , for he was sure it was wrong , somehow . Caidrun began to beat him with her fists , until Rufina pulled her off . " Just stop that , Caidrun , or you 'll go to your room with your helmet on , you hear ? " Caidrun 's mouth clamped shut . And , oh , the look she shot him ! Tamborel could n't stand it any longer . He decided to take a risk . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to understand her better than the others . " If I sing what Caidy wants , " he said slowly , " you must promise not to tell . " Rufina frowned . " Tell ? " She shook her head . " I  | do n't understand . But whatever it is , Tamborel , I promise . Go on . " Tamborel turned to Caidrun . " You want to hear your mamma 's notes ? Here : " He intoned Rufina 's heynim in turn , four high , pure notes climbing down , four more going up again , like steps . " Pretty ! Pretty ! " Caidrun clapped her hands . " ' Gain , Brel ! ' Gain ! " " Why , " exclaimed Rufina . " They 're the notes of my cluster , exactly . I do n't believe it ! How did you do it , Tamborel ? " Tamborel stared at her , surprised . Up until this minute , he 'd assumed that everybody else could do the same . " They 're in my head , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I never heard them laid out clear like that . They sound such a jumble to me , always overlapping . Sing them again . " Tamborel obliged , this time arranging them zigzag , alternately high and low . " Do your mamma and pappa know you can carry heynim notes like this ? " Rufina asked him . Tamborel recoiled . " No , no one must know , you promised . " " I do n't see why , " Rufina said . " It 's not as if you 're using actual heynim . And it does n't seem right , keeping such a gift quiet  --  from your own folk , too . Yet I 'll hold my tongue , " she assured him hurriedly . Scooping up Caidrun , Rufina hugged her tight . " Look at her : she 's smiling ! " Tamborel sang on through the fall , hut after the  | monsoons set in , his singing , his very visits ceased . Now all the folk were crowded indoors , imprisoned by the driving rains . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were open field and sky , for the wives with families underfoot , for the children unable to go out and play . Sickness abounded , due to wet and chill and damp . Mistress Bider was kept busy dispensing decoctions for the ague and rheum ; Yornwey tuned her faleyn to the fusty grain pox and moldy fever . Almost everyone succumbed to flagging spirits after long successive days of dark gray skies . But the monsoons passed , as they always did , and spring arrived . The village threw off its monsoon shutters and emerged , blinking , under the sun to dry out . Dearly as he wished to go see Caidrun , Tamborel had to help Hwyllum every day , breaking up the soggy ground , clearing ditches . Meynoc was there , also , helping Bombrul . He had certainly shot up over the winter months , Tamborel noticed . To his father 's shoulder now ! On Tamborel 's first visit after the monsoons , Caidrun gave him a hard time . As if it had been his fault that he had not come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things were as before . Then , suddenly , it was Caidrun 's second anniversary . It was a quiet affair , indoors , with few guests  --  no children , save for Meynoc and Tamborel . Eleyna , Hwyllum were invited . Cerie , and Yornwey . Mother  | Turner and Mistress Fossek arrived , gathering their heynim and stowing them on the porch . " Where 's our anniversary girl ? " Eleyna looked expectantly around . " Rufina 's bringing her directly , " Bombrul said , and Caidrun burst upon them , swathed in bright pink flounces . The frills at sleeve and hem made her arms and legs look thin and pitifully bony , and the pink made her skin seem sallow . Her hair , which Tamborel loved to see flaring out around her head , was scraped back and caught behind each ear in huge pink bows . Tamborel moved up . " Happy anniversary , Caidy . " Caidrun ran to him , hugging his knees . " Sing , Brel , sing ! " Tamborel felt his cheeks flare . " Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he feared she would burst into a squall , but instead she merely turned from him and ran to Bombrul , clamoring to be picked up . " Never mind , Tam'shu , " Eleyna murmured . " She 's cranky from her nap . " Not so , Mamma , Tamborel answered silently , and braced for trouble . " My , how you 've grown , young lady , " Yornwey said . " Good thing I brought you a size larger new dress . Here . " Yornwey held out a parcel , brightly wrapped . Caidrun seized it and hurled it from her . " Here , here , my girl . " Bombrul set her clown . " Mind your manners . Open the pretty that Yornwey 102 l01  | has brought you . " Caidrun beat her fists against Bombrul 's legs , then ran to her mother . Rufina looked around at everyone , quite at a loss . " Perhaps if we ignore her ... " Caidrun stamped her feet and tugged Rufina 's skirts . " Do n't want ! " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said loudly . " No ! No ! No ! " Caidrun tore off a ribbon and threw that down now . Her hair , freed on one side , sprang out like frytt-burrs . Rufina looked around apologetically . " She 's not that used to company , you know ? " She turned to Caidrun . " Come now , dear . Be nice . " Caidrun ran from the room . Rufina made to follow , but Bombrul pulled her back . " She 'll come around . Let 's get on with the party . " As soon as everyone was occupied , Tamborel fled to Caidrun 's room . He found her huddled in a corner , staring at the floor . " Caidy ? Want to play ? " She turned her back . He started to sing a song . No response . He tried a heyn note or two , softly , but even that did not work . Laughter floated down the passage , the stilted sound of people ill at ease . Tamborel made a face . Why did n't they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Still . . . there they all were , standing heynless for Caidrun 's sake . Then again ... " Serve them right , " he said aloud . If they 'd taken Caidy to Silwender  | in the first place , they would not have this mess . Right now , what Caidrun needed most was to hear heynim again . Or just one  --  the one that was rightfully hers . Tamborel slipped into the next room up the passage : Rufina 's . No sign of the heyn box , but then they would n't leave it lying around these days . He poked around some more , opening closet doors and chest drawers .... He climbed onto the bed , craning up to the high shelf over the night table  --  and there it was ! Tamborel reached it down . Somewhere , deep inside , the voice of caution sounded . Bad boy . You know it 's wrong . There 'll be trouble . It 's only for a moment , he told himself . To cheer her up on her anniversary . No one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caidrun had n't moved . Tamborel strode over , put the box to her ear , and jiggled it . Caidrun whipped around , her face transfigured . " ' Gain ! " Tamborel obeyed . Beaming , Caidrun snatched at the box and Tamborel whipped it around to her other side , just as he had long ago . And they were off , playing tag with the heyn box , all around the room . In the light of the lamps , Tamborel could see the f l u s h on Caidrun 's cheeks , and the sparkle in her eyes . Finally , she caught the box , and pulled . " Brel give Caidy ! " Tamborel shook his head . " No , " he said , and tugged it free , held it out of reach . Caidrun 's smile vanished .  | She opened her mouth and let forth a screech . " Give Caidy , give Caidy , give Caidy ! " Silence in the middle room . Tamborel looked toward the arch . Any minute they would come rushing to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In a panic , Tamborel stuffed it down his shirt . A moment later , in they came . " What happened , Tamborel ? What 's wrong ? " Tamborel swallowed , trying to think up some excuse . But he need n't have bothered . The grown-ups crowded around Caidrun , all talking at once . He slipped out , restored the box , and made for the middle room just as they brought in Caidrun to open her gifts . Now Tamborel kept his distance , watched her tear the wrapping from each present then toss both aside . Rufina tried to put her back to bed , but Caidrun would have none of it . So the grownups tried once more to ignore her , hoping that she would settle down . Tamborel eyed Caidrun guiltily . All his fault she was so out of sorts . But he 'd only tried to make her happy on her anniversary . Meynoc invited him into his room to throw table stones . Tamborel went thankfully . They had not been playing long when a row erupted outside . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the porch , the empty boxes scattered at her feet . And in the air above her head ? Heynim  --  everybody 's , all mixed in together !  | Hold up , boy , do n't walk so fast . What 's fired you up this soon in the day  --  or should n't I ask ? " " Sorry , Pappa . " Tamborel pulled back , matching his long stride to Hwyllum 's stiff , early-morning gait , ignoring the pointed jibe . It did n't take much for his father to guess that he and Caidy had quarreled again . But he could n't afford to admit it . They passed the well , and went on , toward the fields . As they neared Caidy 's house , Tamborel slowed , and now Hwyllum drew ahead . " I suppose you 'll be stopping by to make up with her again ? " His father glanced back , shaking his head . " That miss . I do n't know why you persist . Where 's your self-respect ? "  | Tamborel halted by Caidy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I promise . " Hwyllum sighed . " Very well , Tamborel . But this is all going to stop . " Frowning , Tamborel watched Hwyllum trudge on toward the fields . The threat was not new , but the tone was sharper . He turned anxiously up the garden path . Hwyllum had never liked his friendship with Caidy , still watched for an excuse to part them , and she was no help . Always difficult , always picking fights , venting her eternal wrath on him . " One day you 'll go too far , " he 'd warned her , just the night before . But she 'd only taunted him , as usual , pushing him to walk away for good . Rufina was at the lattice . " You want Caidy ? I 'll see if she 's up . " Tamborel unslung his hoe and rake and waited by the step . Hwyllum was already out of sight . Too much ! Caidy knew he 'd be on his way to work and in a rush . He was about to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Judging by her tousled hair and crumpled shift , she 'd come straight out of bed . " Will you be my partner at the Harvest Gathering or not , Caidy ? " She eyed him sourly . " I will not , I told you so last night . Besides , why would you want to go with me ? " " Because  --  oh , please do n't start again . Because we 're best friends . Will you ? " Her face said no . That this last bout of bickering was not yet over . Tamborel heaved a big sigh . Oh , why was he always the one to make the peace ? He almost turned and walked away ,  | until he caught the look in her eyes . She was testing him again . " Three days ago , you said you 'd like it . " " That was then . Perhaps we should stop seeing each other . That 's what Hwyllum wants . " That old song again ? Tamborel 's spirits sank . " Not true ! Hwyllum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not any more . " She flicked a hand toward the stream of men heading for the fields . " Hwyllum does n't even like me . In fact , he wishes I 'd just vanish . Everybody does . But you , Brel , everybody loves you . " She looked up at him archly . " You 're much too good for me . " " Stop it . " Tamborel glanced up the road . " Look , I have to ? " " And quite the man now . Tancey Bider fancies you . " Tamborel felt his face catch fire . " Caidy , stop this minute ! " " Your folk say you and I  --  our closeness  --  is ... not natural . Even now , when I hardly see you any more , " she added , sticking in another barb . " Hah ! That 's not true . " " They 've fixed for you to take Tancey to the Gathering . " " Nonsense ! Listen , if I ca n't take you , I sha n't go . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Just you wait , Brel : you 'll soon see how right I am ! " All day he hoed and raked , taking it out on the soil . Time was when he always could read ( : aidrun 's thought and gauge her mood , could sense exactly  | how she felt  --  and why . But now ? She was always nursing some imagined slight or insult . Hwyllum does n't even like me . In fact , he wishes I 'd just vanish . Whatever she says or does , however much she goads me , he told himself , I can not , will not turn my back on her . She ca n't help the way she is . They 've made her like this , shutting her away for so long . " I smell rain . " Hwyllum straightened , and , leaning on his hoe , took out his kerchief and mopped his brow . Grateful for the interruption , Tamborel stopped also . Clouds were massing , the air had taken on the eerie violet glow that threatened storm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careful moves , the wince as he looked up : Hwyllum 's back was acting up again . Lightning flashed , thunder rolled , and several neighbors shouldered tools and headed for home . To Tamborel 's relief , Hwyllum followed suit . " Your mamma and I were talking , " his pappa remarked , as they crossed the field . " About the Harvest Gathering . " " Oh ? " Tamborel braced himself . " Mamma said that Tancey Bider expects you to take her . " Tamborel pulled up short . Was Caidy right , then ? Had his parents  --  and Mistress Bider  --  really plotted behind his back ? He let his breath out slowly . If so , could he blame them ? He was nothing short of an embarrassment : going on eighteen and still unat-  | tached . Meynoc was wed , and the rest were spoken for . Worse . . . With great effort , Tamborel kept himself from glancing to the silent , vacant space above his head . Not a day went by without his reliving that first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , standing in the street with Hwyllum and Eleyna , and Yornwey turning to him with a smile . " We have all the heynim we need . Shall we give Tamborel this last one ? He 'd felt so proud . At thirteen and some he was surely ready . He remembered stepping out to claim the passing sphere . With all eyes fixed on him , he 'd bent his mind toward it . He well recalled the prick of elation as it checked , bounced , then began to move his way . He heard again the gasp , as , suddenly , it halted , wavered for a heartbeat , then sailed up into the blue . Tamborel had fled home , wanting to die . Hwyllum and Eleyna had gone after him , and Yornwey . " Do n't worry , Tamborel , " the zjarn said . " It 's too soon , that 's all . " " Too soon ? I 'm almost fourteen . " Meynoc had held three heynim by then ! " There 's something wrong with me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move , then stop . I swear I did n't let my mind slip , so why did I lose the thing  --  why ? " Yornwey shook her head . " As it checked , did you feel anything inside ? " I12 113  | Tamborel put his hands to his temples and pressed . " I . . . do n't know . " " Well , no use fretting now , " Yornwey said . " Next year you 'll do fine . " That next year had come and gone with like result . Again , he 'd snagged a heyn , then , as it had begun to lurch toward him , he 'd lost it the same way . Folk talked then , for being heynless was unheard of . Some blamed his old accident ; others , Caidrun , though what his affliction had to do with either , he failed to see . The fact remained that for some strange reason , he stood out in the street year after year , willing just one small sphere to bend to his command  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sleepless nights . Why , of all people , should he be so bereft ? He had a finer sense of harmony than Yornwey , and Bennoc and Throm . So why not a greater power to snag ? The two were said to go together . To think he 'd once dreamed of becoming a zjarn ! Of entering the Hon'faleyn and winning renown with healing har-monies ... . Sometimes , when Caidrun was in a rage , she taunted him with her own handful  --  all she was allowed , being not yet thirteen . " Poor Heynless One , " she sneered , mocking him as no one else would dare . Only the night before she 'd goaded him , as he 'd tried to show her how to adjust a heyn 's pitch . " Spin it faster and you raise the tone ; slow it down and you lower it . " Caidrun would n't listen , did n't  | want to learn . " But your cluster 's such a jumble , Caidy . You could make it so much more harmo-nious . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's my cluster . I like it as it is . " " Heynless Wonder , am I ? I 'd rather be that than hold your ill-tuned hodgepodge . It rattles like a can of nails . I marvel that you sleep nights ! " Tamborel clenched his fists . Not Caidy 's fault that she was difficult , that she lacked a fine ear . Folk had made her this way  --  and now they punished her for it . He turned to face Hwyllum . " I 'm not going to the feast , Pappa . " Hwyllum 's face stiffened . " Not going ? " Another clap of thunder came as the first large raindrops splattered down . " We 'll talk of this at home , " Hwyllum said curtly , moving on . " I 'll not stand out here getting drenched , arguing with a disobedient son . " There came a sudden , distant shout . " Bre . . . el ! " Caidrun , running toward them , her heynim jigging discordantly . " Now what does she want ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her blue eyes unusually bright . Her hair bushed out around her face . " I changed my mind , " she said , her eyes on Hwylluin . " I 'll go with you to the Harvest Gathering , after all . " Hwyllum 's head snapped around . " What 's that ? " He craned past her to Tamborel . " You have asked Caidrun ? Just now you said you would not go ! " 1I4 115  | Tamborel swallowed . " I  --  was mistaken . " " I 'll say ! " Hwyllum looked to Caidrun . " He 's taking Tancey Bider . " " That I 'm not ! " " Indeed you are , young man ! " Hwyllum looked thunderous as the dark clouds roiling overhead . " I 've not even asked her . " " Oh , but you will , you will . " " You mean  --  it 's already planned ? " Tamborel glanced to Caidrun , and knew then that she 'd provoked this scene on purpose . Hwyllum cleared his throat . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Tancey Bider expected me to ask her . " " No , I did not . " Hwyllum shook his head emphatically . " I said as how she expected you to take her , which is quite a different crock of seed . " " That it is ! " Tamborel cried , beside himself . " Well , I 'll not do it ! How will I look , taking a girl my parents picked for me  --  and behind my back ! " " So Brel can be my partner , after all , " Caidrun chipped in brightly . " Is that not so , father-mentor , dear ? " Hwyllum 's face went deep , dark red . " A man squires a sweetheart to a feast , not a twelve-year-old chit . Whatever Tamborel says here and now " ? his voice rose ? " he 's taking Mistress Bider 's lass , and that 's my final word . "  | Tamborel ate supper fast , while Hwyllum scolded and Eleyna looked on with reproachful eyes . The meal over , he ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made for the brook , speaking little , though Tamborel could feel her eye upon him . At the water 's edge , she stopped and turned about . " So ? How is it with Hwyllum ? " Scooping up a pebble , Tamborel sent it skimming . " He 's furious . Even Eleyna 's upset . " Caidrun laughed . " Good . Serve him right . Serve them both right . " " Caidy ! " " Let 's cross over , shall we ? " Caidrun took off her shoes , slid down the bank and edged out into the  | water . " Oooh , it 's deliciously cool , and  --  oh ! Watch out , these stones have grown so-o-o slippery . " Tamborel swallowed his annoyance and followed . They slipped and slithered across the pebbly bed , scrambled up the other side and sat , chafing their numbed feet . Presently , they lay back , gazing up into the storm-washed sky . " So clean and bright , " Caidrun murmured . " As if the clouds had polished everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fancies . Who else would see rain clouds as polishing rags ? And yet . . . things did seem better now . The sky was clear ; the light , sharp , and colors looked bright and clean . He loosed a cautious breath , unwinding , some . There came a slight jingle from Caidrun 's cluster . " I still wonder where they come from , Brel . Remember the arguments we used to have ? " Tamborel nodded . " You said they were drops from the sun . " " Hah , now I know better : heynim are not natural , but made . " " Made ? " This was new . " How so ? " " They 're metal . Metal comes from ore . And ore is worked by smiths . " " But what smiths ? And where ? " Tamborel shook his head . " If that were so , folk would know it . " Caidrun sat up . " Not necessarily . They say the world is a big place . " Tamborel smiled up at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | " Why ? " Caidrun plucked down a heyn and handed it across . " Here , take it . Shake it in your fist . " Tamborel enclosed the little sphere hesitantly in his palm . So long , since he 'd held one . . . He shook it , felt faint vibrations  --  and something shift within . " Well ? " Caidrun demanded , as he handed it back . " Admit it , Brel . " She released it to rejoin her cluster . " The heyn is hollow and something 's loose in there , causing it to chime . " " No one would dispute that , Caidy . " " Then no one would dispute that they are made . " " There are other natural things just like this that we ca n't explain . " " Such as ? " " Such as frytt-burrs . " At harvest , the spiny fryttburrs burst amid the grain , letting out their delicate , translucent treasure : small white globes that rose above the fields like ghostly heynim . Each contained small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fools ' heynim , folk called them . " Then there 's the colly bean , " Tamborel went on . Too sour for cooking , each oval bean encased a grub , which ate its way out , emerging as a silver moon moth . " The frytt-burr , the colly bean : they 're both hollow and seamless and have something inside , and they 're not made by human hand . " " Neither are they metal , " Caidrun countered . " Argue all you like , heynim come from someone 's forge . "  | " Then whose ? " " Who can say ? But one day I shall trace them backward to their source . " " Hah ! Surely that 's been tried already ? " " I suppose , unless they came from a place where folk do n't go . " Tamborel rolled to face her . " Like the Jagged Mountains ? " Where the mist wraiths danced at the edge of the world . " Why not ? There 's no one out there to watch the heynim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make them , either , Caidy . " Caidrun let go a sigh . " I suppose not . But it 's a thought , is n't it ? " " An ingenious one , " Tamborel murmured . " From the finest mind in Fahwyll . " " You think so ? " Caidrun leaned toward him . " Oh , Brel , you will take me to the Gathering ? " Tamborel weighed his answer carefully . " If I thought you really wanted it , " he said at last . " But I suspect you only mean to stir things up . " " So you 'll be taking Tancey Bider after all ? " Caidrun was n't laughing now . In fact , she looked quite tight and pinched . " No , Caidy . I sha n't even go . " " Not go ? " Caidrun clapped her hands . " Oh , wo n't they just hate it ! And wo n't they hate me , worse than ever ! "  | " Please , Caidy , do n't , " Tamborel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tancey Bider will be so mad ! But let her say one word to me  --  one word ! " " What will you do ? " Caidrun shot him one of her sly smiles . " Wait and see . " Suddenly , Tamborel had had enough . Of pain he could n't ease ; of taunts , imagined slights , and endless , small vendettas . He stood , reaching for his shoes . " Wait ! " Caidrun scrambled up after him , catching at his sleeve . " I 've something to show you . " She dug into a skirt pocket , pulled out a wad of dark stuff . She shook it out , then let it dangle . It looked like a dead thing , the pulpy carcass of some strange , small animal with shreds of skin or entrails hanging . Tamborel recoiled . Was this some twisted joke ? " What is that ? " She thrust it at him . " Take a look . " The moment his fingers touched it , he cried aloud . It was old , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : a helmet , the helmet , the very first one . It looked so small , thought Tamborel . Yet it had seemed monstrous once . He tugged at one of the fastenings and it came away in his grasp . How many times had he tied and untied those things ? He let the fragment fall . " Where did you find it ? " " In an old box . Can you believe Mamma would save such a horror ? " " Why did you bring it , Caidy ? " To remind him of  | the town 's collective guilt ? She remembered , surely , how he 'd hated the helmets , too . How he 'd nagged for years until the grownups said she need n't wear one any more . Caidrun dipped into her pocket and held out a tinderbox . " I want us to burn it . Make a ceremony , you know ? " Tamborel stared , aghast . " Caidy ! We ca n't strike sparks out here so close to harvest . " Fire in this hot , dry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they 'd lost five fields of ripe grain to a dry lightning fire . Caidrun weighed the tinderbox on her palm . " There 'll be no danger . Everything 's still dripping with rain . Besides , what harm can we do , so close to the brook ? Come on , Brel , let 's make a pyre . " He held back . " It 's just surface wet . And someone will see the smoke . " " How ? They 're all indoors . Here , " she went on , an edge to her voice now , " give me back the helmet . If you wo n't share , I 'll do it by myself . " Tamborel sighed . " All right . But first we clear a patch , right at the water 's edge . And we wet a circle all around it . " They scraped clean a wide patch of dirt , laid in its center a small pile of twigs . Then they sprinkled the surrounding earth with water from the brook . Caidrun laid the helmet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , let me . " Tamborel took it from her , thinking that if there was to be any trouble , it should fall on him , for Caidy had enough to bear already . As he bent to make a spark , Caidrun touched his arm . " Wait . " She looked up at him earnestly . " We must say something . " " Like what ? " " I do n't know . " Caidrun looked away . " I 'm so tired . Of being here , of being me . Maybe this will change things , if we say the right words . " " Caidy . " Tamborel straightened up and hugged her tight , thinking how Hwyllum had treated her just hours before . My hearth and heart shall evermore be open to her need . . . . Had his pappa 's vow meant nothing ? Tamborel released her , kneeling down again . " I know what to say . Listen : Let the bad times go up in flame . Let stiff old casing burn . And let the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , Brel . " Caidrun looked down , her blue eyes dark , her glistening hair outlined against the sun . " That 's lovely . Will it work ? " " Do n't see why not . " " I do want to change , I do want people to like me . Is it possible ? " " Anything 's possible , Caidy . Now I 'm going to strike the spark . " There was n't much to it . A quick flare , a crackle of twigs , one fleeting puff that gave off a foul and lusty smell , and all that remained was a pile of pale gray  | ashes . These they kicked with a flourish into the quick currents . For a moment , the specks spun on the surface like fluffy feathers , then they were swept away and swallowed up . While Caidrun stood , staring out , Tamborel smoothed out the burnt patch , doused it , and masked it with stones . Caidrun turned . " Oh , Brel , I 'm such a brat . I cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wish there was something I could . . . " With a jingle , one of Caidrun 's heynim detached from her cluster and moved to hover over him . Another followed . Then another , and another , then the last : Silwender 's gift . " Look up , Brel , pretend they 're yours . " He gazed up at the tiny , whirling spheres . Strange , to see them right over his head . He tried to imagine that they really were his , that a nod from his mind could move them where he wished . But he could n't , and Caidrun 's generous gesture only saddened him . " Take them back . " " No . Make music , Brel , go on . " " That I will not ! They 're not mine to tune ! " " Then I 'll set them between us . " She took his hand and pulled him down . " Please , sit . Let 's share them for a bit . I do n't deserve them , anyway . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knee . " You 're nothing of the sort ! You 'll make harmony right fine , one day . " " Just as you 'll snag heynim , one day , " Caidrun said .  | " Are n't we a pair ? Look , just for now , I hold , you tune  --  an even trade . Agreed ? " This was a chance too good to miss . " All right , Caidy . " The golden cluster shifted to hover between them . " Now , Brel . Make music , now . " Caidrun lay back and closed her eyes . Tamborel crossed his legs , then closed his eyes also , shutting out the stony bank and green-black water and radiant evening sky . Then , tuning out all other sounds around him  --  the stream 's rush , a glitter-bug 's whine , a flock of purple grain birds ' piping  --  he focused on the heynim 's notes . He latched onto Silwender 's heyn , slowed its vibrations down . Then he reached for a second , bent its speed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to flash and sparkle in and out of the dominant and secondary harmonies . The fourth , he slowed to a thin , high whine , like the glitter-bug 's noontide lay . The fifth , he spun into polyphonic strings of chimes ; shimmering notes like glass beads on a wire , spiraling the whole . Caidrun released a long , contented sigh . He let himself go now , holding the faleyn effortlessly , al-1 owing it to wash through him . Forgiven was their bickering . Forgotten the quarrel with his pappa and t he badness that would still be there when he got home . All the pain , the spite , the wretchedness was gone t o ashes , and anything was possible from now on .  | For two days , Tamborel and Hwyllum barely rubbed along . Walking to the fields in silence , they toiled side by side working their sickles up and down the rows of sun-ripe grain stalks , speaking only as was needed . At night , they ate in silence , Eleyna filling in the hole with chatter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caidy 's sake . Things wo n't change overnight , he told himself . It would take a while for his words to have effect . The second evening , after supper , there came a tap at the saba lattice . Tamborel glanced nervously to the kitchen arch . Caidy , come for another confrontation ? He ran to head her off . It was Tancey Bider . Tamborel came on guard . Over a shapely arm was draped a swatch of flowered stuff  | that fluttered in the evening breeze . " Good evening , Tamborel . " Tancey 's nod set her heynim dancing . It was a modest cluster , numbering the fingers on one hand , but decent enough for one two years his junior . Her fair , sleek hair gleamed like the ripened grain , her day smock was crisp and fresh even at this late hour . Eleyna popped up behind him . " Why , Tancey , my dear . What a surprise . Tamborel , show her in . Where are your manners ? " Tancey moved past him into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it up . " Mistress Eleyna , what do you think ? " " Oh , my dear , what a pretty gown . " Eleyna glanced to Tamborel still by the saba . " What do you think , Tam'shu ? " Tamborel shrugged , staying put . " It 's for the Harvest Gathering . " Tancey spun around , setting the skirts a-swirl . She fetched up before him , awaiting , what ? Tamborel held his peace . Tancey smiled up at him , her cheeks round and red and shiny as apples . " We chose the colors especially to match your best suit , Tamborel . " He frowned . " We ? " " My mamma , your mamma  --  and I. " Tancey 's smile wavered . " Why ? " Tamborel demanded . " Why would you do that ? " " Perhaps , " Eleyna cut in , " we 'll speak of that to-morrow . " " Oh , no . Let 's speak now . " Tamborel did n't want a row , did n't want to hurt Tancey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this girl upon him . " Tancey , I 'm not going to the Harvest Gathering . " " Not ? ? " Tancey stared , her smile quite gone . " But they said ? " " I 'm sorry , but you must find another partner . " Hwyllum strode from the kitchen . " That 's no way to talk to Tancey . " " Truth never shamed anyone , Pappa . That 's all I 'm telling . " Tancey let loose a short , sharp cry . " Now , my dear , " Eleyna began , but the damage was done . Their visitor fled , clutching her bundled dress . Hwyllum and Eleyna turned on him . " How could you ! " Eleyna cried . " Nay , " Tamborel retorted . " How could you . " " We say you 'll go to the feast and with that lass , " Hwyllum said angrily . " And while you bide beneath our roof , you 'll mind our wishes . " " Oh , do n't , Hwyllum . " Eleyna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not your Tam'shu ! " he burst out . " I 'm not a child now  --  though who would guess it , the way you still treat me ? " Eleyna took his arm . " My dear , we only want what 's best for you . " " No , you do n't , " Tamborel replied bitterly , pulling back . " You want what 's best for you . " Which was whatever was convenient , and respectable . " You , you never really cared for anyone . " " He means Caidrun , " Eleyna said quietly .  | " Oh does he ? " Hwyllum sounded grim . " Well , hear this : Your churlishness just now was shameful . You used to be a good son , a fine little boy , tender and obedient . Now look at you  --  all on account of that , that ? " " Hwyllum ! " " Nay , he 's gone too far . From now on , he 'll stay clear of Caidrun  --  and he 'll take Tancey Bider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asleep , Tamborel crept from the house , down the street to Caidrun 's . He went around the back , called through her saraba . She was up in an instant , pulling aside her shutter . " What is it ? " " Pappa has forbidden us to meet . And I 'm to take 7'ancey to the feast . " " But you wo n't , though ? " " If I do n't , it will go all the worse for us . " " Worse than what ? " " It 's for a little while , Caidy , until people 's tempers die down . " " And when will that be ? " Tamborel stared miserably up at her . " What can I ( 1o ? " Caidrun 's eyes gleamed . " You could tell them to go jump in the brook . " " I low , whilst I bide beneath their roof ? " By leaving it . " She leaned out . " Remember what you said ? ' Let the real Caidy out to spread her wings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . Please  --  stand by me . Take me to the feast . " " Pappa will throw me out . What then ? I 'll be nowhere . " " You 're nowhere now . " Caidrun backed away into the darkness of her chamber . " Quite the man he looks these days , " she called softly . " But he 's still Mamma 's little boy , keeping to the saba . " Tamborel groaned . " Caidy , we 'll show them how you really are , but you must be patient . To defy them now is plain foolishness . " Caidrun 's face loomed once more , pale under the starlight . " Wishy-washy hypocrite . " She spat the words out . " Spineless , Heynless Wonder . I do n't need you , I do n't need anyone . I 'll show them , I 'll show all of you who Caidy really is , just wait and see . " Tamborel awoke with a throbbing head . He would have stayed home that day had it not been for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and set off with Hwyllum , joining the steady stream of men headed for the fields . Tamborel passed Tancey 's front yard safely : no Tancey , much to his relief . The relief was short-lived . Tancey was at the well with a bucket on her arm , in line to draw water . Tamborel dodged out of sight , a move Hwyllum did n't miss . " Be civil , " his pappa warned . As they neared the well , there came a stir : Caidrun , pushing through the waiting women to Tancey 's side . The men slowed and a crowd began to form .  | Tamborel braced himself . " Good day , Tancey . " Caidrun raised a foot and lightly kicked Tancey 's pail . " Come to drown your sorrow ? " Tancey flushed . " Come to wash your face ? " " Poor thing . " Caidrun smiled sweetly . " Just because Tamborel wo n't take you to the feast , no need to vent your spleen on me . " Tancey drew herself up . " Tamborel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Between mammas . They told him after , " Caidrun informed the crowd . " Well , he is n't taking you , scrawny , grubby thing . " " At least he asked me , " Caidrun sneered . " Sleek little pullet , preening your feathers  --  that no one cares to pluck . " Tancey dropped her bucket with a crash . It rolled , then bounced with a dull clank down the well steps . In the quiet , Tancey drew back her hand and slapped Caidrun 's cheek , hard . " Crazy witch . Everyone wishes you 'd died . " Tamborel stood , stunned . That Tancey ! He ought to dash out and denounce her ! But he stayed frozen as in a dream , watching it unfold . Caidrun fingered the weals already forming on her skin . Her eyes on Tancey , she backed toward the well steps . Caidrun  --  retreat from trouble ? I 'll show them , I 'll show all of you who Caidy really is ... ' rainbow started forward now . Hwyllum grabbed Tamborel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move , shot Tamborel one scathing glance , then , turning back to Tancey , fixed her gaze on a point above Tancey 's head . As Tamborel watched in horror , Tancey 's heynim left their place and moved across to Caidrun . " Hey , " Hwyllum growled . The heynim shrank into a solid clump , colliding musically . Then , as everybody watched , the clump rose skyward like a bunch of golden berries . " What ? " Tancey 's mouth hung open . The clump exploded , the heynim shot up all ways , off into the blue . A hubbub broke out . Screeching , Tancey lunged at Caidrun but Caidrun danced down the well steps and raced away , laughing . " Make her bring them back ! " Tancey shrieked . Mistress Bider ran up , crushed Tancey to her bosom . " Four years it took my Tancey to gather that cluster , " she told the crowd . " Now look ! " People were shouting all at once . Rufina pushed her way through , looking distraught . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your wicked girl has scattered Tancey 's cluster ! " Mistress Bider cried . Bennoc climbed the well steps , addressing the crowd . " She does not fear the law , she has no respect for anyone ! " The veins in his neck stood out . " Mark my words , this is but the start ! " Tamborel could stand it no longer . " She was provoked ! Tancey struck her and called her names . "  | " Nay , " a man called . " Yon hussy started it , taunting Tancey over the feast . She asked for a slapping , plain as day ! " Rufina clutched her chest . " What can I do ? Bombrul 's in the field . " Yornwey raised her arms for order . " I call a plenary assembly this night . Rufina and Bombrul will bring Caidrun to discuss the matter . " " And then do what we should have done long since , " Bennoc cried . " Aye , " the shouts came . " Afore she scatters all our heynim . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why had n't Hwyllum stepped in ? He could have stopped it , and should , as Caidy 's father-mentor . Tamborel shifted his tools to the opposite shoulder . Hwyllum had n't wanted to stop it . He 'd let the quarrel take its course , let her go too far on purpose . Oh , Caidy ! What would they do to her now ? Tamborel thought uneasily of Bennoc 's words , Bennoc , who once before had sought to render her blind and deaf . . . . He downed tools and ran to the brook . But Caidrun was n't there . Had she gone home ? he wondered , joining his father back in the field . He very much doubted it : Caidrun was at war . After work , Tamborel sought her again , but his search proved futile . Supperless , he joined Hwyllum and Eleyna in the Farmer 's Hall . So like that other night it was : the heat , the smell , the flickering Iamps ,  | the moths . And the air , charged and tight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heynim ! Never before in all her life had she done ill on purpose . But this was the very worst he could imagine : the ultimate and unpardonable wrong . Tamborel took his seat before the dais , resolving to speak on her behalf , regardless of Hwyllum , of Bennoc , of them all . He 'd tell how she 'd resolved to change , to be the way she used to be . " Before they crippled her . " He glared around at all the righteous faces , come for trial and judgment . " Whatever they say , she 's my friend . The best I have , or want . " He glanced back to the saba uneasily . Folk were growing restless . Should n't she have come by now ? Yornwey mounted the dais , but as she raised her arms for silence , Rufina burst in , breathless and beside herself . " We 've looked everywhere for Caidrun . We 've been along the brook , both banks . But ? but ? " Rufina bent over , covering her face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Bombrul called out behind her , " is that we ca n't find Caidrun any-where. "  | In the commotion , Tamborel edged back , through the crowd , and out . Caidrun was hiding . And she 'd better stay hid , for now . " Tamborel ? " Meynoc ran out after him . " She made me swear I would n't say , but you 're the only one she can turn to , me with the missus due any day . " Meynoc glanced back to the noisy hall . " She came to us at supper . Demanded food . We gave her all we could spare . Then she took off . " " Took off ? " Tamborel echoed stupidly . " Where ? " Meynoc looked grim . " For the Pridicum road . " " The what ? Why did n't you stop her ? " " And let them drag her here ? " Meynoc turned to step back inside . " Go after her , will you ? I ca n't . " Tamborel let out an explosive breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caidy have gone in that time ? He sprinted to the Y-fork , then right toward the Pridicum road . Reaching his house , Tamborel was forced to slow . He leaned against the open gate , his chest heaving . He 'd had no supper . And he was so thirsty , his throat was raw . Dare he stop and pick up a bite ? No ; they might come looking for him . He set off again , crossed the village boundary , and carried on . Paving gave way to rough track , all ruts and potholes . Tamborel remembered how Hwyllum had run that route years before , fetching Silwender to save Rufina 's life . And Caidrun 's . Everyone wishes you 'd died ... He staggered , almost went full-length . She must be lost by now . He glanced up at the merest sliver of a moon . He could see no way to follow in this wide dark . Though come to think  --  there ! Still looking up , out of the corner of his eye he detected a faint line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the line disappeared . So that was it : you kept your eyes above the road to see it ! Pleased with his discovery , Tamborel pressed on . He ran until his legs gave out . Then he walked until his feet burned and he was too weak to take another step . Hardly aware of what he was doing , he tottered off the road , fell under some bushes and closed his eyes . Sleep came fast . For long , he lay unmoving on the hard , bumpy ground . Then , in the hour before dawn , he dreamed of Caidrun . They sat together by the minnow brook , dabbling their toes in the water . The  | sky was blue , the sun bright and warm . They got up and strolled along the bank , while the sky deepened and the first stars came out . Caidrun pointed to her cluster . " Tune them to the evening stars , Brel . " Glad of the chance , Tamborel promptly set to , spinning quick , clear , tones as of tinkling crystal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stars emerged , he broke the separate notes and set the chimes a-shimmer . Caidrun sighed happily . " Beautiful . Oh , Brel , I wish ? " She tipped her face to the stars . " I wish , " she said softly , " I wish you had all the heynim in the world . Think what you might do with them ! Why , you could ? " From way above came a faint , familiar sound as at the monsoons ' end when the first heyn-clouds floated over the village . The sounds multiplied , growing nearer , louder . Caidrun gripped his arm . " Brel . " Out of the night they came : first a trickle , then a stream , then a gleaming , golden , chiming river . And the harmonies ! Tamborel stood , spellbound , as the endless swarm flowed by , stirring a wind , lifting their hair in its passing . Beside him , Caidy stirred and laughed out loud . " I wished for them , and here they are  --  all the spheres in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and make us whole ! " Tamborel began to waken slowly , renewed and in a peaceful state .  | " Gentle folk , this young man is no rogue , but the good son of a respectable man . I 'm taking him home with me . " The zjarn led Tamborel down the street to his big , airy house where he lived alone . He gave Tamborel breakfast , enough for three . Then sat , elbows on the table , watching . In the silence , the man 's heynim circled lazily about his head , their jingle muted . Tamborel did not heed them much at first , for he was too intent upon the hollow in his middle . But as that hole began to fill , Tamborel eased up , letting the peaceful sounds wash through , loosening his knots . Presently , he leaned back , letting out a sigh . Casinder spoke . " This girl : she has much power . Is she who I think ? " " Maybe , " Tamborel answered cautiously . " What exactly did she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clusters , unprovoked . But the truth is that this morning at first light she begged food from four houses and was chased away . She 's Bombrul 's daughter , is n't she ? " " Yes . " " I knew it ! " The zjarn slapped his palm down on the table . Then he looked up , clearly puzzled . " You said she took your heynim also . " " I . . . lied . Though she did steal someone else 's ? but only after she was driven to it , " he added with some spirit . Casinder shook his head slowly . " I ca n't believe  | that anyone would do such a thing , however badly goaded . Whatever has made her like this ? " Tamborel told how they had shut Caidrun away and made her wear the helmet . " So she grew up deaf to the chimes  --  at the very age she should have had them all around her . At least , that 's what I think . " " And you are right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me that Yornwey , your zjarn , agreed to this barbaric treatment ? Barbaric  --  and stupid . Why did they not take her to see Silwender ? " Tamborel explained , about the High Zjarn 's fees , Fahwyll 's depleted coffers . As he spoke , Casinder sighed and shook his head repeatedly , setting his heynim cloud a-shake . " Money is n't everything . Silwender would have helped Caidrun , if they 'd asked . He 's a kind and gentle man . Look at the heyn he sent at her naming . " Casinder shot Tamborel a look . " But tell me , what of your heynim ? Where are they ? " Tamborel looked down at his empty plate . " I never had any . " Casinder leaned forward . " I do not understand . " " I can not snag . " Casinder looked sharp . " What does Yornwey say to this ? " Tamborel frowned . " Why , nothing . " " She never tried to find the reason out ? " " Could she have ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have thought so . If you like , I maybe could --  "  | " Thank you , " Tamborel said . " But first I must find Caidy . " Casinder 's brows went up . " I see . Well , maybe that 's wise . There 's no telling how she might go . Where will you look ? " " Where does the road lead ? " " It runs westward for a full morning 's stride , then it splits three ways . Take the middle road to Minavar . That 's a good two days ' journey . When you get there , go to the Hon'faleyn and ask for Silwender . " " But it 's Caidy I 'm after . " " Exactly . That 's where I 'd go to find her . If she 's not there , the High Zjarn will tell you what to do . " Casinder reached across the table for his hand . " While you 're there , tell Silwender of your own affliction . Being heynless is not natural . I myself have never heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason and maybe even the cure . So do n't be foolish like the rest of Fahwyll : ask his help . " He let go Tamborel 's hand and stood . " You 're itchy to be off , that 's plain . I 'll pack you some food and see you to the edge of town . "  | It took two days to get to Minavar . As Tamborel climbed the hill on which the Hall of Harmonies stood , the early-morning sun reflected off the high stone walls and cast blue shadow under the entrance gate . Beside the gate was a watchman 's box . In it sat a man : small , hunched , with graying forelock . As Tamborel made for the gate , the man scuttled out to bar his way , his heynim bobbing . " And just where are you going ? " Tamborel noted with interest a couple of larger-sized heynim in the man 's cluster . " You have n't let a girl through here ? Not so tall . " Tamborel raised his hand shoulder-high . " Skinny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | " You know how many folk pass through here each day ? " The man cocked his head . " You 're foreign , are n't you ? Of course you are or you 'd not ask such a daft question . Know what this place is ? " " Yes . " Tamborel tried another tack . " I wish to see the High Zjarn . " " You do ? Then I 'll see your pass . " The man held out his hand . Tamborel stared at the empty palm . Pass ? " I have n't one . But I must see Silwender . It 's urgent . " The gatekeeper nodded . " That 's what they all say . Sorry . No one goes past me without the where-withal . " " But I  --  I 've come a long way ? " " So has everybody . If you 're sick , I need a token from your zjarn . If you want to be a novice ? " The man shrugged . " Go home , lad . Only the best get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folk with swarms too great to count , while you ? " The man broke off . " You have n't . . . one . . . single ... " Tamborel leapt in . " That 's why I 'm here ! Silwender will see me . He knows me . In fact , if he finds you keep me out here , there 'll be trouble . " " Trouble ? " The gatekeeper looked doubtful . " I 'll call the Steward . " He stepped into his box and pulled a rope . Somewhere above , a bell clanged , bringing a portly man , in velvet and brocade . " Now what , Kowl ? " His cluster chimed crisply . " This here lad claims to know the High Zjarn , sir . Wants to see him . But he has no pass . "  | The Steward looked Tamborel up and down . " No pass ? " " Nor no heynim , neither . " " No heynim ? But that 's ? " The man eyed Tamborel with interest now . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? he lingered on the word ? " I thought it wise to call you . " " Yes , yes . " The Steward glanced back to the courtyard behind him . " If this is some trick , boy , you 'll be sorry , " he warned . " Follow me . " Tamborel paced the waiting room . People came in from time to time to ask his name and errand . Each time he said , " I 'm Hwyllum 's son from Fahwyll . I 'm here to see Silwender . " He finished off Casinder 's rations . Once , he even dozed . Finally , the Steward reappeared . " Come . " The man walked Tamborel through halls and galleries filled with chiming from passersby trailing huge swarms . " Hurry , " he urged , as Tamborel slowed in fascination . " Move along , Silwender waits . " Silwender waits ! Tamborel felt a rush of excitement . To meet the High Zjarn face to face  --  after all these years ! He dimly remembered silver hair and a flowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Who could forget that piercing look ! Tamborel pictured the old man 's swarm as he remembered it from that day , trailing the length of the village street almost to the Y-fork . That night , those wondrous heynim had filled Rufina 's chamber , thick as sun-bugs massed for fall  | migration . Would the swarm seem as vast , would it sound as powerful to him now that he was grown ? Tamborel quickened his pace . Silwender 's private chamber was up a high turret with a narrow , worn stone stair wide enough for only one . As they climbed those steps in single file , Tamborel 's skin began to prickle in a strange , familiar way . Atop the stair was a small wooden door . The Steward knocked and waited . " Come . " The voice was dry and wavery . The room was tiny : bare stone walls , a narrow , high saraba letting in a flood of light . Silwender sat in an armchair with high , fan-shaped back . Overhead , heynim swarmed like a dazzling aura @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cone . Tamborel shut his eyes and covered his ears , feeling giddy . Hands steadied his shoulders . The onslaught faded to a distant chiming . Tamborel opened his eyes . The heynim hovered , muted . The Steward was gone . " Here . Sit . " The old man pointed to a footstool by his chair . Silwender was smaller and frailer than Tamborel had expected . But he 'd remembered the hair aright  --  and the eyes . " You are Hwyllum 's son ? You wish to see me , I understand . " He glanced to the space above Tamborel 's head . " Yes , sir . " Tamborel sat gratefully . " About Caidrun , Rufina 's daughter . Do you remember her ? You sent her a heyn to mark her naming . "  | " What about her ? " " Is she in the Hon'faleyn ? " Silwender frowned slightly . " Should she be ? " " Casinder said  --  I thought ? " Tamborel stood up . Silwender waved him down again . " Take a breath , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a time , tell me what this is about . " Tamborel sighed . " Caidrun 's in trouble , though it 's not her fault . And I must find her before something really dreadful happens . " The High Zjarn folded his arms . " This trouble would n't have to do with scattering heynim ? Aha , I thought so . You 'd better tell me more . When did this trouble truly start ? Not in this past day or so , I 'll wager . " " No , sir . It 's been coming almost since she was born . " Tamborel told of Caidrun 's first anniversary ; how she 'd snagged heynim to her , how he 'd saved her , of his injuries . Of the plenary meeting and the judgment on Caidrun . The old man sat , motionless , though his heynim shook as Tamborel told of Bennoc 's plan to blind and deafen Caidrun . But he slid not speak until Tamborel had finished telling of the hated helmet and how folk had shunned her . And how finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witch " and said how everybody wished that she had died . " So . This is a bad business . Very bad all around . " Silwender looked at Tamborel from under his brows . " She did n't scatter your heynim , did she ? "  | " No , sir . I have n't any to scatter . " " Say again ? " Tamborel sighed . He felt such shame to tell it . " I can not snag . I want to , but there 's something stopping me  --  though I can tune real fine . Casinder said that you might be able to ? " He stopped , recalling why he was there . " He said that Caidrun would come here , to the Hall of Harmonies . And if not , that you 'd tell me what to do . " Silwender shifted in his chair , stroking his fine , silver beard . " She arrived in Minavar yesterday , but she did not come here . There were several incidents , I was informed , but I had no idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Is she in Minavar still , sir ? " " Who knows ? Folk are searching , but so far no one 's caught her . " Tamborel got to his feet . " I must go . " " Go where , boy ? " Silwender shook his head . " Those are angry folk out there . Folk who know the city . If they ca n't find her , you certainly will not . Let me think . . . " Silwender sat back in his chair and closed his eyes . Several large-sized heynim floated down to frame his head , their deep notes sounding out above the rest . Despite his anxiety , Tamborel felt his body give . He leaned forward on his stool , propping his chin in his hands , watching , listening . His eyes began to close ... . " I agree with Casinder . " Silwender 's voice . Tamborel opened his eyes and stretched , feeling  | wondrously refreshed , as if he 'd slept  --  for how long ? " Sir ? " " Caidrun 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I can not say . So you must go back home and I 'll send word when she turns up . " Go home ? " With all respect , sir , I must stay and find her . " " And how will you live , young man ? " " I 'll manage , somehow . It will not be for long . " Silwender sighed . " You do not know the city . Look , you 'll sleep here tonight , then tomorrow  --  well , we 'll see . "  | They found him a berth in the novice quarters . The cell was narrow , and bare save for twin double bunks along each side wall . Facing the door was a small saraba bright with mid-afternoon sun . Left alone , Tamborel crossed the room and looked out westward . A sea of rooftops vanished into haze . Beyond , on the skyline , pale gray spikes marked a misty range . He leaned out . Were they , they had to be the Jagged Mountains where the mist wraiths danced : the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forbidding , just as in those merchants ' tales . Propping his elbows on the sill , he recalled how , long ago , he 'd told them to Caidy . How only nights before they 'd ar-  | gued over whether heynim could have come from those mountains or no . Tamborel let out a sigh . If only Caidy were there to share this sight . He leaned out farther now , peering down onto nearby roofs beneath which dark streets twisted like tangled yarn . Was Caidy still in Minavar ? They said not , but then they did not know her . She might well be down there still , dodging , staying hid in spite of all their searches . Tamborel clenched his fists , recalling the scene at the well : Caidy 's angry face , the bright red weals across her cheek . The look she 'd thrown him . " I 'll not go home until I find you , however long it takes , " he growled . Quick steps sounded outside . The door opened , three youths burst through and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foremost of the group , tall , with long face , long , thin nose , strong black brows and wavy hair curling down onto broad shoulders , came forward a step more . His eyes went to the space above Tamborel 's head and stayed . " Are you lost ? " He seemed friendly enough . " I was put here . For the night . " All three , Tamborel could n't help but see , held clusters as large as Yornwey 's , with some bigger heynim , too . The dark-haired youth nodded . " Well , I 'm Jarcyd . " He turned to the others . " He 's Keiryn . And he 's Hewl . " Keiryn was even taller than Jarcyd , but thin and stooped , with pale , pitted skin and lank brown hair falling over one eye . At mention of his name , he  | tossed back his wayward locks , revealing a brow so high and narrow it looked squeezed . " Glad to meet you , " he said , then smiled , and Tamborel took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with raw , red face that made him look angry , reached but to Jareyd 's shoulder . " So what 's your name ? " Hewl said , his pale eyes bright with challenge . " Tamborel , of Fahwyll . " " Fahwyll ? " The boys looked at one another . " It 's east of Pridicum , " Tamborel explained . The boys looked no less at a loss . " What are you doing here ? " Hewl 's question was a challenge . " You need n't answer , " Jareyd said , throwing Hewl a warning glance . " It 's all right . I 'm looking for a girl . " Hewl looked arch . " A girl ? What made you think she 'd come here ? " " Casinder  --  a zjarn  --  said that she might . " Keiryn spoke up . " She 's gifted , then ? " " Yes . No . " " Aha ! The mystery deepens . " Hewl climbed onto the upper right-hand bunk and sat , swinging his well-muscled legs . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gate ? And who let you stay the night ? " " Hewl ! " Jareyd turned to Tamborel . " Here , take my bunk . " The upper left-hand bunk , across from Hewl . Without waiting for Tamborel 's reply , Jareyd threw  | himself onto the cot beneath . Suddenly , Keiryn spoke . " She 's the one they seek : the heynim-scatterer . " Jareyd laughed at Tamborel 's startled face . " Is n't he a riot ? Keiryn reads minds , which can be a nuisance , I tell you . He 's going to be a zjarn . " A zjarn ! Tamborel eyed Keiryn in awe . " Never mind about all that , " Hewl said . " What happened to your heynim ? Did this weird girl scatter them , too ? " Tamborel hesitated . " N-no . I never had any . " Best to get it over with , much as he hated to admit it . " You do n't say ! But that 's ? " " Hewl , let him be ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new and brash and does n't know his manners . Like how to treat those . . . " He faltered . " Those less fortunate , he wants to say , but has n't the nerve . " Hewl grinned . " To hold no heynim is quite some feat . How do you do it ? " Heat flashed to Tamborel 's face  --  then fizzled . There was no malice in Hewl 's eyes , he saw that now . The boy was simply quizzing him . And that made him feel more at home than all this polite talk . Why , Hewl 's bluntness felt easy as old shoes : was he not inured to it from a boyhood spent with Meynoc and the other boys ? " If only I knew , " he said , shrug-ging . Hewl pressed on . " I mean , you look normal enough . Yet even the simplest folk hold one or two . " He swung his legs up onto his bunk and lay back . " I  | can not imagine how it would be , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , but I have that , " Tamborel cried , stung . " I can tune a faleyn . " " A faleyn ? " Hewl was up again . " How , without a schooling in the Basal Harmonics ? Even we novices do n't learn to tune the simplest faleyn until our second year . And , anyway , how could you do it without a cluster ? " " The girl I 'm seeking  --  she let me use hers . " " And you tuned it , I suppose ? " The boy looked frankly skeptical . Why , Hewl thought him a liar ! Now Tamborel was rattled at last . " Words get us nowhere , " Keiryn said . " Let Tamborel prove his claim . Here . " The boy sent his cluster across the narrow space to bob by Tamborel 's head . So . Tamborel looked at all the boys in turn . Keiryn was of a mind with Hewl . And likely so was Jareyd , for all the show of courtesy . These privileged students of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the test as did the boys in Fahwyll when he begged their acceptance ? Well , so be it ! Tamborel climbed up onto his borrowed bunk and surveyed the unfamiliar cluster . The tones were well matched , he found . In among the small heynim were three middle-sized and two big ones . He pointed to the last . " We never see those in Fahwyll.  | Are they more powerful than the smaller ones , Keiryn ? " Keiryn flipped back his hair . " No . All are part of the whole , as is the nature of harmony . Do you know their names ? The smallest are intyl ; the middle ones , anintyl ; the largest are omantyl . " Tamborel repeated the names slowly . " Intyl . Anintyl. 0mantyl . " No one in Fahwyll had even heard those names , not even Yornwey . " So now you know , " Hewl said loudly . " Will you get on with it ? " Tamborel nodded , shifting his legs , making himself comfortable . As he moved , the cluster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Its nearness brought back the evening by the minnow brook , when he and Caidrun had shared such peace . . . . He could not weave those glad harmonies now . In fact , he wondered if he ever would again . Oh , Caidy ! He reached out , focused on the two omantyl . He set them rolling on a common axis to form a sort of sound rod for which they formed the poles : Tamborel and Caidrun , bound together , held apart . Then , taking each anintyl in turn , he set them spinning to chime with each pole in sequence , pointing up their separation . Finally , he scattered the tiny intyl , dropping their peals like tears into the winding helix ... . As Tamborel spun the sound strands , he lorgot himself , forgot the boys , and that he was proving  | himself . All was sadness , and pain , and deep remorse . Caidy ... Oh , he could n't bear it ! Out there , forsaken and abandoned . Caidy , you are not alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's end .... Hewl was the first to stir . He cleared his throat and blew his nose . " What a weird faleyn . Where did you find it ? Not in any Table , I 'll bet . " " Tamborel has no need of the old Tables . He 'll be writing new ones . " Keiryn summoned back his cluster , Tamborel heard it go and felt a pang . " What did you see , Hewl ? " Keiryn asked , but Hewl , grunting , only turned away . " I saw my grand-father , " Keiryn volunteered dreamily . " We used to be so close . No one else had time for me . He took me for walks , he told me marvelous stories , adventures that went on forever . When he died , I hated him for deserting me . " Keiryn lay down and turned to face the wall . " I remembered summers when I was small , " said Jareyd . " Life was good then . The days seemed long as a whole year and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marcur . He moved away . I thought it was because of me , because I always made us stay out far too late . " Sighing , he lay down also , and curled up into himself . The sun went down , the room filled up with dusk . Tamborel leaned back and closed his eyes , deep into  | the past few days . And thus they all stayed , bound into a common silence , until the supper bell . Next morning , Silwender sent for him . " Caidrun is not found . Go home . I 'll send word when we have her . " " No ! I must wait here ! " " But what of your parents ? " What , indeed ? thought Tamborel . If they 'd rejected Caidrun , they 'd rejected him , too . " If you send me away , I 'll not go back to Fahwyll . " " Oh ? " The High Zjarn stroked his silky beard with fine , dry , tapered fingers . " Jareyd claims you tuned a faleyn last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked down . " No , sir . " " I see . Well , we 'll look into it , presently . If Jareyd speaks true , then perhaps you 'll bide a while and learn something , at least , until Caidrun comes . As for your folk , I 'll send word now to tell them that you 're safe and in good hands  --  that is , if you do n't object , " he added dryly . " No , sir . " Tamborel could scarcely speak the words . He , in the Hall of Harmonies ! Maybe if he proved his worth , when Caidy came they 'd both stay on and learn along with Jareyd , Keiryn , Hewl , and all the rest !  | Next morning , after breakfast , Tamborel sat in on a novice class , some dozen or so boys and girls around his age , including Hewl , and Jareyd , and Keiryn . Awed by the size of the students ' clusters , he sat in a back corner , feeling useless and conspicuous while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the speed of rotation . This they did by counting the degrees aloud , overshooting then pulling back . At first , he thought this was what they were supposed to do , but as he watched , he realized that their overshooting was an error and they were trying unsuccessfully to correct it . Awe gave way to puzzlement . How could they be so clumsy ? Tamborel inched  | his chair forward . Why did they count rotations by degrees , anyway ? He could simply sense the pitch and rate of spin the way he knew how hot or cold or hungry he was . It was all he could do not to leap up and show them ! Rawl , the tutor , seemed quite satisfied , however . " Good . Now : select a single heyn , try to reverse its spin suddenly and see what happens . " The novices moved to obey , but their heynim continued to rotate in the same direction . Only Keiryn and a tall girl with three omantyl in her cluster succeeded , after a fashion . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then began to revolve in the opposite direction . " That 's right , " Rawl said . " Now , Keiryn , Synla : try again , and this time make your reversal sharp . " As the class watched , the two repeated the exercise once , twice , then several times until , at last , Synla succeeded . For an instant , as the heyn snapped into reverse spin , Tamborel caught a faint sound way above the chime , a sort of whining hum as at home when cold spring winds keened through the narrow space between houses . He frowned , trying to remember , sure that he 'd heard that sound before somewhere . " Very good , Synla . You 've just produced phantom harmonics  --  ghost chimes , " Rawl said . " Overtones that increase a heyn 's power one-hundredfold . As you heard , they last no more than the space of  | spark , so whatever you want to achieve with them , be quick about it . Continue . " Tamborel edged his chair out even farther @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only he had heynim to work with ! Oh , how he would like to try ! Rawl paused by Tamborel 's chair . A big man , with kindly , weathered face , grizzled hair and beard , looking more like a farmer than a Fellow in the Hon'fa-leyn  --  except for the great swarm circling above him . " I hope you 're enjoying your visit with us . " His eyes went to the space over Tamborel 's head . " Though I suppose it 's mainly hard to just sit by and watch . " Tamborel nodded . Rawl spoke true  --  but not in the way he intended . The door opened . Silwender entered . The novices stopped their practice , pulling in their clusters . The High Zjarn shot Jareyd a keen look from under his fine , arched brows , then addressed the class . " If I have been informed correctly , our visitor from Fahwyll has something to share with us . Tamborel , you will please step out . " Tamborel froze , clean forgetting how only moments before he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with all eyes upon him , he decided that he 'd rather reveal his skill in more secluded fashion , say , atop Silwender 's high stone stair . Silwender beckoned him forward . " How big a cluster would you like ? "  | How big ? Tamborel would n't know . " About this many . " He held up both hands , fingers spread . Nodding , the old man turned to the novices , quelling scattered sniggers . " You will sit , and be still . " As they obeyed , the High Zjarn detached a cluster from his swarm and sent them across to Tamborel . A gasp from the novices now , quickly stifled . Tamborel forgot his fright . Silwender 's own heynim ! Intyl , mostly ; two anintyl and three wondrous deep and mellow omantyl . He gazed up , smitten by their beauty . They reminded him of Eleyna 's flower beds at the height of summer , especially the anemones : small bright gems , their vibrant colors snagging passersby . . . . A garden , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , filled with brilliant chiming ! " You should have seen Silwender 's face ! " Jareyd exclaimed , the moment they got to their room . " Truly , he was amazed . " " Do n't exaggerate , " Hewl said . " Let us say he was somewhat impressed . What did he tell you afterward , Tam-boy ? " " That he 's to stay on as a novice , of course , " Keiryn said . " Is that not so , friend ? " Tamborel walked past them to the saraba and stood , gazing out over city and empty plain to the distant mountains beyond , hugging the memory of that interview to himself a moment longer . " ... You will live and study with the rest . Learn the  | Tables of Basal Harmonics , and the Books of Lore , and all the fields of application with the other novices . But you 'll learn to tune your faleyn here , in my chamber , with such heynim as I provide . Agreed ? " Live and study with the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farmer 's son , enrolled into the Hall of Harmonies by the High Zjarn himself ? Many times Tamborel had pictured this unlikely occasion . How glad he 'd feel , and proud . But at that moment all he felt was guilt . He had no business to be there . He was supposed to be seeking Caidy . It did n't seem right that the search worked to his great good while she was still at large . " What about Caidrun ? " The old man 's eyes gleamed . " You think her fate is in your hands now ? That we could afford to waste such gifts ? Once she comes , we 'll bring her to a proper state of mind . After that , we 'll see . " Silwender gave him a little push . " So now go along . We 'll begin work together in due course . Meantime , I 've sent again to your parents , letting them know that you 're a student here now . And I 've invited them to visit you at any time they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Tamborel had felt quite numb . But now he felt a surge of joy , like the rush of blood to a limb that has been sat on for too long . He turned from the saraba . " I 'm to be your roommate , if that 's all right with you . "  | " Wonderful ! " Jareyd cried , clapping Tamborel on the shoulder . " Though you 'll take the lower bunk now . " " Shall you be a novice , or what ? " Hewl demanded . " Considering your prodigious talent . " " I shall . " Tamborel 's spirits surged higher still . " But how , without a cluster ? " " I 'm to tune with Silwender . " Hewl whistled . " One week , and Tam-boy will be too grand for us ! " Tamborel grinned , pointing up . " Caidrun calls me the Heynless Wonder . It 's a great leveler , so you wo n't have to watch out for my cap size . " " Did Silwender say if he can heal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had too much else to talk about . " Hewl clicked his tongue . " Too bad , Tam-boy . So ask him tomorrow . " " He wo n't , " said Keiryn . " Not until Caidrun 's found . " " What did Silwender say about her ? She 's in for trouble , I 'll bet . " " No , Hewl , " Tamborel said defensively . " She only scattered a few heynim . It 's not the worst crime in the world . " " Actually , it is , just about . " Jareyd looked almost apologetic . " It says so in the very first Book of Lore . Perla read it to us just last week . " " Perla ? " " Our reading tutor . "  | " She 's a tyrant , watch out ! " " Hewl ! " Keiryn spoke up . " She 's strict , Tamborel . But also fair , and very patient . She reads beautifully , and never makes you feel the dunce . " " Good old Keiryn , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jareyd was about to say , the text goes ' While one may vie for unsnagged heynim , one may not appropriate another 's cluster , either to steal , or to scatter it . Neither may one broach a single heyn , whatever its condition . ' " " ' Broach ' ? " " It means you ca n't dig them up once they 're buried , or take them apart to see inside . And you especially can not harm the ones in use . Know why ? Because , " Hewl went on without a pause , ' Heynim hold the world in being . ' " " They do ? " Tamborel glanced out of the saraba . Maintain that vast city , that great , wide plain , those mountains and the skies above them ? All Alyafaleyn itself ! He scanned his roommates closely . Surely they were teasing . And yet . . . chimes helped grow good crops and ensure fair weather , and they healed sickness , too . " You are serious . " " Indeed , " Keiryn said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Book of Mysteries . Put simply , it says that heynim are what hold us in existence . As long as they keep chiming , Alyafaleyn goes on . But if one day they should fail , our world and everything in it will perish . "  | " So , as I said , that girl is in for it . " Hewl was goading him again . " Do n't listen , " said Jareyd . " Silwender will take care of her . " Tamborel hoped so . He thought back to the High Zjarn 's words . You think her fate is in your hands now ? That we could afford to waste such gifts ? " You 're right , " he said . " In fact , she 's to be a novice , too . " The next day , Tamborel began studying to read and write and count . He pored over meaningless squiggles on parchment , feeling much ashamed . But Perla , a tall , thin woman with long , curved neck and black hair piled atop her head , sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two hours , she drew bold , curly characters , which Tamborel copied , learning their names by heart . By the end of the lesson , he was reading a few simple words . Perla smiled . " Tamborel , you 'll catch up with the class in no time . " He felt his color come and go . He 'd done well ? And enjoyed himself into the bargain . Oh , this was the place to be ! Tamborel gazed around the room at shelves stacked with scrolls and fat books bound in leather . So many ! To think that most folk outside never even saw a single one . Keiryn came up behind him . " I told you Perla was all right , " he said . " She 's very pleased with you , I can tell . " While the other novices went on to work with Rawl , Tamborel stayed behind with Perla . Under her  | calm and patient guidance he learned fast , growing more confident each day . By the end of the week , he was reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sleep at night . A son of the grainfields , learning to read , and write , and tally numbers . Not even Yornwey can read letters or count the heynim in her cluster ! And any day now he 'd start tuning with the High Zjarn ! But it was two weeks before Silwender summoned Tamborel up his stair . " Ah , come in . The messenger is back from Fahwyll . Hwyllum and Eleyna say to tell you they love you and are proud of you . They regret they can not visit in the midst of harvest , but they hope to come after the monsoons . You do n't look happy , boy . What is it ? " " They 'll not come , " said Tamborel . " There 'll be sowing and ditches to clear . There 's always some-thing . " " Well , they ca n't help that , Tamborel . So do n't leap to judgment , eh ? We all must live as best we can . Now , to another matter . " " Caidy ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Silwender shook his head . " Not yet , my boy . Sit down . " Tamborel took his place on the footstool at Silwender 's feet . " It 's not about Caidrun . It 's about you and your affliction : I want to help you , if I can . "  | " If you can , sir ? " " It will depend on you . " " How ? " " You must desire it . " Desire it ! How could there be any doubt ? " I want to be healed , to be made right and whole . I 'm sick to have my swarm . " " Really . Well , let 's see . " Silwender picked up a small rolled mat beside his chair , shook it out , and laid it between them . " Get you down , go on , " he urged , as Tamborel hesitated . " You 're not afraid ? " " Oh no . Why should I be ? " Tamborel stretched full length on the mat and closed his eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't ? He heard the creak of the High Zjarn 's chair , the rustle of his robes . " Relax , my boy , and for pity 's sake breathe , or you 'll expire before I 've tuned a single note ! " Tamborel unclenched his fists and breathed in deep . " That 's better . Now let yourself go , eh ? " Silwender began to tune , starting in the bottom register , then sliding up . So many varied tones , such subtle differences in timbre ! Any other time , Tamborel would have lain entranced by the richness of it all . But for some reason his heart began to race . What did Silwender mean to do ? " I sense great fear . Calm down , boy . " The old titan 's voice sounded far away . " Slow your blood , open yourself to the chiming . Do n't think : feel . " Tamborel took deep , slow breaths , letting go ...  | An image filled his mind : of glistening filaments coiling into one thick string @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . He had an image of the slow worm in the minnow brook , parasitic larva of the flit fly . It rode the currents seeking out an unsuspecting host . Lighting on the hapless minnow , it slipped through the fish 's gills and burrowed deep inside . His mind snapped to , his body stiffened . He could n't breathe , pain seized his chest like wire . " Stop ! Stop ! " Silwender broke the faleyn instantly and with such force Tamborel 's ears sang and everything went dark . When he came to again , he still lay on the mat , Silwender still sat in his chair , watching him . " Ha . So . Stay a minute longer , then come up easy , boy . " " What happened ? " Even as Tamborel asked , he knew . Phantom harmonics  --  nicknamed ghost chimes .. . overtones that increase a heyn is power one-hundred-fold .. . Silwender 's ghost chimes , that he 'd heard long years before , lying underneath Rufina 's sill . Now once again they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resisted them ! How ? How had he done that  --  and why ? Silwender helped him sit up . " What happened , sir ? " Tamborel slumped forward , his head in his hands . " You would not let my faleyn do its work . " " You mean I fought the healing ? Why ? Why would I do that ? "  | Silwender spread his fine , dry hands . " People deny themselves for many different reasons . Self-hate , perhaps . Guilt . Or fear . " " Fear ? " Fear of being cured ? " Sometimes it 's a case of ' better the affliction we know than the cure we do n't . ' Only this spring a woman begged me to try to heal her blindness of many years ' standing . Then she resisted me , as fiercely as you did now . " " Did you cure her , sir ? " " Only after she realized that while she wanted to see , she was also very much afraid of what would meet her eyes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want healing and that I also fear it , at one and the same time ? " " It 's highly possible . I did sense fear in you . " " But of what , sir ? Not heynim , or I 'd not be tuning them , would I ? " Silwender stroked his beard thoughtfully . " Whatever , it 's deeply hid . It may take some time for us to find it out . " Deeply hid . Tamborel thought of the questing worm and shivered . " But we will , in the end ? " " When you so wish it , boy . "  | Tamborel studied hard , keen to catch up with the other novices , yet not entirely immersed as he might have been . From time to time , in those early weeks , whenever anyone came into class with a whispered message for the teacher , Tamborel would come alert , sure that the message was for him , and that Caidy had come at last . But as the weeks passed , and still she did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies until sometimes he scarcely thought of her until he was abed and drifting off to sleep . He had not dreamed that there could be so much to learn , about the world , and the heynim , and those who tuned  | them . One day , Rawl led the class to an innermost courtyard surrounded by four high , slender turrets . " Now you all know something of tuning heynim , hear this : one tunes a cluster , but one spins a swarm . Listen . " For a moment , Tamborel heard nothing but the usual clamor of chimes floating out through myriad sarabas , mingling in the high air . Then all at once , the sound of chimes burst upon them from somewhere close , filling the courtyard with rich , melodious echoes . Tamborel wheeled full circle , looking to each high turret . Yes , the chimes came from not one , but all four of them . Rawl pointed . " Up there sit the Sky Spinners , easing us through into fall , keeping at bay the winds and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are safely latched inside their houses . " Tamborel gazed up at the narrow , arched sarabas , wishing he could see those Spinners at their work . " How many Spinners are there , sir ? " Rawl looked pleased at the question . " They number twelve in all , and are divided into three tetrads . The first tetrad spins to the sky , the second to the earth , and the last to our general state of well-being . " " Are there any more Spinners outside the Hon'fa-leyn ? " asked Synla . Rawl shook his head . " Only these twelve . They split their day into three watches , and take turns to help keep our world in balance . You just heard the  | Sky Spinners begin their watch . However , in times of emergency , all the Spinners work around the clock until the general harmony is restored . " Tamborel listened , enthralled . No longer did he wish to be a zjarn . He pictured himself , sitting up in one of those high turrets , spinning his vast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chimes that carried all the way to Fahwyll without his having to stir ! The days grew short . Layer upon layer of thick gray cloud gradually piled up over the city , bearing ever lower under its own weight , until the Hon'faleyn turrets were wreathed in mist . Lamps were lit . Men sealed the sarabas with stout steel shutters , transforming the sunlit halls into a labyrinth of gloomy caves and passages . To Tamborel , the Hon'faleyn took on the air of a fortress preparing for a siege , a comfortable one with no danger in it . He thought of the folk in Fahwyll shutting up their tiny houses , already under one another 's feet . Here , in the Hall of Harmonies , there was so much room to move . He found himself looking forward to the monsoons that year , would have wanted to hurry them along ? except for Caidrun ... . Tamborel stood by the saraba , his palms pressed to the shutter , praying for Caidrun to come . The others were sound asleep , but he could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shutter , spray-  | ing it with pellets of rain : the monsoons had begun . He pictured the wide , dark sky beyond , and Caidrun lost under it . Even the lowliest stray creature was given shelter in this season . But Caidy , who would shelter her ? He saw her lying beneath a hedge , her mouth filling with rain . He turned and leaned his head against the cold iron , feeling each jolt from the strident winds . Oh , why had n't he gone to find her ? Why had he listened to Silwender ? " Caidrun will come , " the High Zjarn said , every time he mentioned her . Now he could n't go if he wanted to , could n't get past the gate unseen . And if he did , where would he go , and how would he find her under the drenching rains ? Tamborel climbed onto his bunk and lay , falling at length into a restless sleep . A dream came , of wild , wet skies and empty plain , dark and wind-driven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wind pushed him back but he pressed on , driven by a sense of urgency . There , just ahead , a small smudge against the murky sky . " Caidy ! " The figure turned , flinging up its arms . A familiar voice wailed over the wind 's whine . " Bret  --  where are you ! " Tamborel began to run , stumbled , fell headlong onto soggy turf . As he picked himself up , he saw her coming blindly toward him . " I 'm here , Caidy -- - here ! " On he ran , until he could see the rivulet streaming from her tangled locks and shining on her He 'd  | almost reached her , arms outspread , when suddenly , she cried out . " Caidy , hold on ! " he cried , but she melted like salt and was washed by the rains into the soggy turf . Next morning , he lingered over breakfast , picking at his plate . " Are you well ? " Keiryn sat beside him at the empty table . " You 're so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tamborel stared down . The dream of Caidy frightened him , but he dared not share it , not even with Keiryn . Everyone here knew the tale of the boy who was turned to salt , and they dismissed it , together with all other such stories , as ignorant fancies . While Keiryn would likely not laugh at him , he 'd find some other means to explain it away . " It 's not surprising you had such a dream . It shows how worried you are about Caidrun . " Tamborel was certain there was more to it than that . He and Caidy had always been so close . He 'd often sensed what she was feeling , even when they were apart . If she hurt or was in trouble , and if she needed him . Of course , since she had run away , that link had been broken . But his dream had been so strong . Was Caidy calling out to him ? Was she in trouble somehow ? Keiryn guessed partway right , anyhow . " It 's Caidrun , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the mon-soons . " " Silwender said that she would turn up . So why  | has n't she ? Something bad has happened , I just know it ! " " What does Silwender say now , with the monsoons here , and everything ? " Tamborel shook his head . " What can he say , but ' Try not to worry ' ? " " I suppose . " Keiryn sighed . " Tamborel , I 'd be out of my mind , too . Listen , you have my ear any time . " In the weeks that followed , Tamborel found great comfort in Keiryn 's offer , even though he did n't take it up . During the day , things did not seem so dire . Then , Tamborel imagined Caidrun with him in class , the two of them learning together . He could just see her blue eyes light up on hearing the wondrous harmonies , could see her perched beside him , chin in hands , listening while Perla intoned line on measured line from the Books of Lore . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a friendly roof , an adopted member of some loving family , snug and sheltered from the driving rains . And why not ? She could be charm itself when it so suited her . But at night , as he lay listening to the rattle of iron shutter and the lash of rain against stone wall , Tamborel lay fearing for her safety , and slept badly , haunted by more dreams . One day , in the middle of a class with Perla , he was startled to see one of her heynim suddenly leave her  | cluster and sink slowly to the floor . She bent and picked it up , holding it out for them all to see . " I have been expecting it . Look how it has lost its luster . It is the tenth heyn that I have lost this year . " She broke off with a laugh . " Do n't look so worried , " she said . " I 'll probably lose quite a few more to damp before the monsoons are over . But I 'll soon replace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do with your old ones , mistress ? " asked Synla . " For now , I keep them in a treasure box . At the end of the monsoons , we Fellows hold a ceremony to place them all in a vault below the main assembly hall , and " ? Perla smiled regretfully ? " I 'm sorry , but students may not watch . " The monsoons dragged on , a dreary time that drained the spirits and slowed the keenest body down . Tamborel wondered how he ever could have liked the idea of being shut up in that place , away from outside light and air . Then , just as tempers frayed to flash point , the wind changed , the rains eased , and the skies cleared . Men came to take the shutters down and fresh air blew through the open sarabas , sweeping out win-ter 's must and mold . Folk began to liven up , looking to the mountains , watching out for heynim . " Once Silwender gets his , he goes on spring tour , " Hewl said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to catch up on your reading and writing . "  | " He 's doing well enough already , " Keiryn said . " As well as you , Hewl . " " The first merchants ' boys arrived today , " said Jareyd . " Maybe tomorrow there 'll be something for us . " " Merchants ' boys ? " Tamborel had not heard of those . " Apprentices , " Jareyd explained . " They travel with the grain and seed traders , spring and fall . They bring us packages and messages from home , for a modest fee . I 'm hoping for some ginger candy from my grandmother . " " Nice , " said Tamborel , wishing he might get something from home . Not that that was likely . He 'd never noticed any such merchants ' boys in Fahwyll . But to his astonishment , the very next day a youth came asking for him . He gave Tamborel a beautiful blue blanket from Eleyna and a pot of sun-bug honey . " She says to tell you Hwyllum 's back is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , " the youth recited by rote . " There was a big to-do after you and Caidrun left the village . Four Pridicum men came for heynim and would n't leave until they were recompensed . Rufina and Bombrul , Yornwey and other% each gave one heyn until the men 's clusters were made good . The village was a-roil with the news of you in the Hon'faleyn . Some maintain it is a lie . Yornwey sends her respects and looks to see you home one day . " The youth paused , checking off his  | fingers . " Let 's see . Ah , yes . Tancey Bider is betrothed to Hormer Voor . And much as your mamma wants to see you , you 'll understand a there is a lot to do in the fields now . She and Hwyllum will try to visit you as soon as they can . " Hormer Voor ! thought Tamborel on his way to Perla 's class . He was old enough to be Tancey 's father ! Perla read again the passage from the First Book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jagged Mountains and how it was forbidden to travel there . " Those who go beyond the peaks shall never have a heyn , " the passage went on . Perla held up the tome , showing the margins filled with dire illustrations : tiny stricken figures , lying on the ground , all heynless . " What does that mean , do you think ? " " Sounds like a direct threat to me , " said Hewl . Perla smiled , her thinned-out cluster jingling . " Jareyd ? " " Could be . You definitely lose your heynim . Maybe you die as well . " " I see . Synla , what say you ? " Synla was , by far , the best thinker in the class . " If it 's a threat , that implies some kind of vengeance , or punishment for wrongdoing , " she said slowly . Keiryn leaned forward . " Going to the Jagged Mountains is wrongdoing . " Synla smiled . " Or simply folly . This could be a prediction merely . "  | " Prediction ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : ' If you do this , that will follow . ' " Synla nodded toward the saraba . " The prevailing winds blow this way , toward Minavar . So to snag a heyn , you stand this side of the ranges . Stand the other side , and the winds will carry the heynim away from you . That 's plain common sense . " Hewl shook his head . " You ca n't say for sure it 's not a threat . " " True . " Synla nodded . " I 'm simply offering another interpretation of the writings , Hewl . " " And a good one , " Perla said . " Scholars have argued over these words for years . And likely will forever . Tamborel , do you agree with Synla ? " " I think so . They could be either a threat or a pre-diction  --  though I would n't care to put them to the test ! " Each day , Tamborel and Jareyd , Keiryn and Hewl looked out from their high vantage point , expecting at any moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skies remained empty . A week passed , two weeks , three , and folk began to grow restless . " They are late , " Perla admitted . " I can not recall this happening before . I can not begin to guess why it would be . " The time for spring sowing arrived , and still the heynim had not come . Silwender canceled his tour amid reports of growing worry in the provinces . The  | mood in the Hon'faleyn went from sober to grim . At last , the High Zjarn convened the school : the students cramming the well of the assembly hall , the Fellows lining the galleries above . Tamborel scanned the Fellows for Rawl and Perla , marveling at the solid layer of swarms hovering above them . So many heynim still , despite the hundreds that they 'd buried only weeks before ! Silwender climbed onto the platform in front of the hall and raised his arms . In the sudden hush , the High Zjarn 's thin dry voice carried to the rafters . " Since rumor is rife , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swarms do not come yet this year , no one can say why . Yet we must be calm , watch , and wait . Above all , say nothing beyond these walls of the dan-ger 's extent . Talk changes nothing , and only sows fear . " Lessons resumed in an air of suppressed excitement , the sort that comes when great disaster looms . Peril charged the air , magnifying every look and gesture . And when Tamborel caught his fellow students ' eyes , he saw his own concern reflected there : if the heynim never came , what would happen to their world ?  | Later that day , Tamborel went for his lesson with Silwender . " You look anxious , boy , " the High Zjarn said . " And it 's not surprising . It 's hard on you young ones , away from home . I 'll have the tutors speak with you all later , to hear your concerns about your families . " About Caidy , too , thought Tamborel . Who would counsel her if things got worse ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cluster over to him . " Come . We have work to do , in fact it 's more important than ever to keep our mind on it . Begin . " Tamborel spun a faleyn in rising quarter tones , a purely mechanical exercise supposedly . But as he  | bent his mind to it , anxiety stole in , distorting the purity of the intervals . When Tamborel had done , the High Zjarn stayed silent for a while . " Mmmm , " he said eventually . " Even I , who have come to bear with indifference the worst that the world can heap upon me , feel your faleyn 's pull . Yes , I own you 've made me anxious . " Silwender drew the heynim back into his swarm . " It 's a singular gift , young man , to tune what 's within you , and sound its echo in another 's heart . I confess you do confound me . I 'd pegged you for a future zjarn . " Tamborel leaned forward . " And now ? " Silwender shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physical body . I 've done it best and longest of anyone alive . That 's why I 'm High Zjarn , head of the Hon'faleyn . But as for you . . . " The old man spread his hands . " Could I be a Spinner ? " The moment it was out , Tamborel felt foolish . All this talk of zjarn and Spinner and he heynless ! Silwender frowned . " I . . . can not say . " " Because I have no cluster ? " Silwender smiled . " That we 'll remedy . Tamborel , your gift is so special it has as yet no name . It needs careful thought . " Tamborel looked away , feeling hollow . Silwender thought it special ? It was n't , not at all . " What you just said about my sensing how folk feel ? Rawl calls it the power of empathy  --  and Keiryn has it , too . "  | " Hmmm . " Silwender stroked his beard . " Empathy is the power to identify with another 's feelings ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does have that worthy gift . But you , Tamborel , you prick us in unexpected places , stirring within us feelings we do n't even know we have . " Silwender put his hand over his heart and beat a light tattoo with his fingers . " As I said , I think you find them first within yourself , then spin them into faleyn which find resonance in us . During these past months , you 've made me feel joy of which I 'd never dream myself capable . And pain so unbearable it has long been buried and forgot . " " Oh . Forgive me , master . " Silwender waved away his apology . " Rather I should thank you , boy . This will prove a wondrous tool . Perhaps you 'll cure what I can not . " " But you can cure anyone of anything , sir . " Silwender shook his head . " I treat sickness that is manifest . I can not heal the undiscovered ill  --  such as that which afflicts you , Tamborel . No one can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and perhaps this gilt of yours will help us do that . " " And Caidrun ? Might it help her too ? " " Always we come back to Caidrun . " The High Zjam looked wry . " Well , let Caidrun come , and let us speak with her , and then we 'll see . " " I sometimes wish ? " " Wish what ? " 182 183  | " That I 'd gone on to find her . " " And I say again where would you have gone , eh , boy ? And what if you 'd gone wandering while she turned up here ? No , you 're in the proper place , of that I 'm sure . " Silwender was so sure of everything , thought Tamborel , shaking out his new blanket and spreading it over his bunk . About this so-called gift of his , and about Caidy coming to the Hon'faleyn . He himself was not so convinced about either . He exchanged good-nights and climbed into bed . While he could not deny he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' there were more to it as Silwender said , would n't he just know it ? And all that business about it promising to prove a wondrous tool when he could n't snag a single heyn ! On the other hand , if he did possess this power , how wonderful if he could use it on Caidy . All those years of torment , while he could offer only sympathy . Though that had helped her , some , when she had nothing else . He lay on his back , closed his eyes . Where are you , Caidy ? What are you doing now ? Tamborel turned onto his side . How had she vanished so completely ? At first , he 'd been relieved as reports of her ceased . But now he found himself wishing for more such , for any sign that she was still alive . When at last sleep came , it was troubled . He  | dreamed they sat together by the minnow brook , dabbling their toes in the water . The air was warm , the sky was blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brel the Heynless . Never mind , take my cluster . I do n't want it , I have no ear . " She sent it toward him . " Caidy , do n't . It 's yours . Besides , I do n't deserve it . " " Oh , but you do , catch ! " The heynim gathered speed , golden pellets shooting with deadly force toward him . " Caidy ! " Tamborel sat bolt upright in his bed , his chest heaving , his face slick with sweat . Had he cried aloud ? He listened , heard the steady breathing around him . He slumped over , wiping his face on his nightshirt . Those heynim coming at him like slingshot ! " Catch , " Caidy had said , her tone pure venom . Oh , how could she ! It was only a dream , Tamborel reassured himself . Even so , it still hurt . He lay down again and closed his eyes , trying to find his way back to the minnow brook , but the sunny day had turned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no sign of Caidy . " Caidy ! " Her mocking laugh came back in answer . Tamborel made toward the sound , glimpsed her shadowy shape ahead . " Caidy  --  wait ! " Behind her rose a line of ragged peaks . As he raced to catch her , pale mist writhed up from the ground and coiled around her . Caidy spread her arms and spun around , her skirts swirling . Then she slowly sank from sight . Tamborel  | stumbled forward , fetching up before a jagged hole with steps leading down . He knelt , and leaned into the hole , cupping his hands to shout . A puff of cold damp air rose toward him , rank with mold and decay . Tamborel 's skin went icy . " Caidy ! " The echoes resounded far below . Her shrill laugh faintly answered , then all was silence . As he straightened , mist rose from the ground and curled toward him . Tamborel leaped up and turned to flee . He awoke in a shivery sweat so bad that they sent for Silwender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Odd that you should get it now , so long after the monsoons . Well , whatever its cause , I give it two days  --  though you 'll be keeping to your bed for at least a full week more . " As Silwender said , it took only two days for the heat and pain of the fever to subside . But Tamborel lay for another week , locked within its aftermath ? and in his nightmare 's thrall . Once , when he and Keiryn were alone , he almost told about the horror still palpable within him . But somehow , he could n't bring himself to give it voice , not even though Keiryn practically invited him to speak up . " It 's not just the fever , is it ? " Keiryn had come back to the chamber midmorning for a warmer tunic , ostensibly . He perched on the opposite bunk . " If you 'd care to share , I 'd be glad to listen . You can count on me , you know , and I 'd never tell anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the one to confide in , of that Tamborel was sure . While he enjoyed parrying with Hewl , and while Jareyd was unquestionably their leader in matters of rules and protocol , Keiryn was most like the brother Tamborel had never had . " I 'm fine , really I am , " Tamborel answered . " But if I 'm ever in a bad fix , I 'll call on you , I promise . " " Snap out of it , Tam-boy , " Hewl said , into the second week . " At this rate , you 'll still be abed feeling sorry for yourself when we 're all graybeards . " Hewl 's barb proved more effective than all the sympathy . Three days after , Tamborel was headed back to class . " So you decided to live , " Silwender remarked , when Tamborel went for his lesson . " You took your time , though . The fever lasted just two days . But , then , " he went on , as Tamborel began to protest , " it was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Care to tell me its cause ? " Tamborel hesitated . " I had a nightmare , " he said at last , watching Silwender 's face . But the old man only nodded , looking grave . " Go on . " It was hard at first , but as Tamborel spilled the horror from his mind , he began to feel relief . When he had done , Silwender surveyed him from under his brows . " What do you make of your nightmare , Tamborel ? " " I 'm not sure , sir . Bits and pieces of it really happened . Caidy and I sat by the brook just before she  | ran away , that was when she let me tune her clus-ter . " Tamborel shivered . " Those heynim coming at me  --  that happened , too , though that I do n't remember . It 's how I had my accident , you see . How the bad things started . But Caidy was only two and did n't know what she was doing . " He winced , recalling her deliberate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She 'd never hurt me on purpose , I swear . " " Hmmm . Have you had other dreams like this ? " Tamborel thought back . " Yes , though not lately . " " Tell me about them . " Tamborel recounted his earlier dreams : of Caidy in the rain and dark , lost , or melting like salt into the ground . " I see . Well , let me think , then we 'll talk some more . Maybe these dreams will help our search . " " To find where Caidy is ? " Silwender sighed . " To find where you are , boy . Now to other matters . About this gift of yours : I am calling it the power of resonance . And if one day you hold a swarm , you 'll be our first Spinner of the Resonances . " Tamborel stared . " I do n't know what to say . " " For that I am glad . I 'm not giving out largesse , only a name for your power , and a  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much must happen before that . Now : say nothing of this to anyone , do you hear ? " Spinner of the Resonances . Tamborel repeated the title over and over , savoring its sound . For a while back in class , he sat straight and held his head high . Spinner of the Resonances sounded so much better than Tamborel the Heynless ! But as the day wore on , the euphoria wore off , giving way to older doubt and worry . It 's a singular gift , young man , to tune what 's ' within you , and sound its echo in another 's heart . Silwender expected something of him , something that he was sure was n't there . He had nothing : no gift , no heynim . Just a lot of expectations . And a heap of worry over Caidy . What was he doing in that place ? he asked himself irritably . By bedtime , Tamborel was in a dangerous mood . " You look so tired , " Keiryn said . " Are you all right ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jareyd said , climbing into his bunk . " He was more than well when he left Silwender , " Hewl said . " Did you notice him come into class ? What did the old man say , Tam-boy ? Did he make you a Fellow ? Or tell you something of your girl friend ? Come on , spill . " Normally , Tamborel would have thrown out some friendly retort , but tonight he found their harmless banter unbearable . Without a word or look , Tamborel got into bed and lay , facing the wall . There was a short , awkward silence . Then someone t m out the light . Tamborel lay stiffly , willing himself asleep . Before he was even halfway , the nightmare images  | sprang into his mind as if they 'd been lying in wait : of the converging heynim , of Caidrun dancing with the mist wraiths then vanishing underground . He shuddered , shrinking down into the bedclothes . He could have told his roommates , and they 'd have laughed him out of taking an old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he lay there in the dark and on the edge of sleep his fear was almost too real to bear : what if Caidy had danced with the mist wraiths and they had made her theirs ?  | Next day , loud bells clanged , rousting everyone from bed in great excitement . " Heynim ! " Jareyd cried . " At last ! " The excitement was short-lived . The heynim , barely one hundred in all , drifted in twos and threes high above the city rooftops . These went to the Fellows in the Hon'faleyn : not near enough to go around . In the weeks that followed , though sentinels kept close sky watch , no more were sighted . Tamborel noticed a marked shift in the atmosphere . The winter had taken a greater toll on heynim thin usual . The deeper tones especially had thinned out , and the rich level of sound was noticeably diminished .  | So was their power . Although the Sky Spinners toiled around the clock with their depleted swarms , spring appeared to stall . The sun shone pale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beasts , and frosts nipped the new and tender shoots of grain . Silwender canceled any tour of the provinces until further notice . Charity begins at home . Our gate is swamped with local folk . It seemed not only Tamborel had taken the moldy fever out of season . Townsfolk also ailing from swollen joints , coughs , and wheezes trekked through the public healing halls in endless lines . At last , the numbers grew so great that the novices were called in to assist with simple chores : taking names , heating poultices , giving remedies to sip . At night , the zjarns rode out on qarlim to tend folk prostrated with the moldy fever  --  the moldy fever  --  still at this late date ! The Fellows being now too busy tending the sick to teach , classes were suspended . The students were set to work alone in the library , studying subjects of their own choosing . Tamborel took down several books on spinning faleyn ; fat books compiled by the Fellows over the years . So many words , he thought . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he browsed through , he began to see that there was more to spinning than he 'd thought , and that the Fellows had acquired a special know-how that came only after years  | of practice . By the end of one morning , he was all too grateful that they 'd troubled to record their hard-won mysteries for him to share . " I see you 've put your time to good use , " Silwender said , at Tamborel 's next lesson . " Your skills have increased tenfold . " Spring dragged into summer , barely . The skies stayed weak and rain fell every day . What crops survived were poor and blighted . Harvest came  --  and went . " It 's a crying shame , " Hewl grumbled . " We 'd been so looking forward to the Harvest Festival . " A threeday gala when folk brought tributes by the cartload to the Hon'faleyn and the city was one huge open house . When the novices decked themselves in colorful hoods and gowns and ran the streets to be showered with food and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ah , well . I 'll have to mark it somehow . I think I 'll grow a beard . " " A beard ! " " Do n't look so shocked , Tam-boy . I 'm almost twenty-one . " Come to think , Tamborel himself was going on nineteen now . A fact he 'd hardly noticed with no one to remind him . " How can you talk of galas and beards when folk can scarcely feed themselves ? " Jarcyd demanded . " It 's going to he a hard winter out there . "  | " Never mind about out there , " Hewl said . " It 's going to be short rations all around . I heard today there 'll be no novices this year  --  there 's barely enough food for us . " The skies darkened . The monsoons came early and with a vengeance . In the Hon'faleyn , the mood was grim . " They tell us to keep a good face on things , " Hewl grumbled . " I 've clean forgotten what it 's like not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Me , too , " Jareyd agreed . " I 'm counting the days to spring . " " Then the lines of sick will come again , " said Keiryn . Tamborel found his sessions with Silwender sorely taxing . Not that he found tuning difficult . In fact , he now could handle some sixty or so heynim at one time . The trouble was that worry touched his every faleyn , however hard he tried to keep it out . Like the one he was tuning now , an elementary Sky Spinner 's exercise . " Tamborel , I asked for all shades of blue . I hear only pale gray . Where are the deep blue tones of summer ? You 're not a novice any longer : concentrate ! " " I can not hold the deep tones steady . The winter 's been too long . " " That 's your excuse ? " Silwender 's tone was sharp . " What if our Sky Spinners thought that way , eh ? Day and night they tune their faleyn to the deepest , purest blues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heynim . Or that the monsoons have not ended . No matter that the rains still come down . That 's discipline , Tamborel . It 's what remains when all else fails . " " But , master , " Tamborel began . Oh , what was the use ? He let the faleyn go . " What is going to happen ? " The High Zjarn clasped his hands together in his lap . " I do not know . " The next day , the Fellows suspended lessons as they had the year before , dismissing Tamborel 's class into the library . At first , he leafed through the now-familiar books on spinning , but growing restless , he got up and wandered from the main chamber into the little dusty rooms beyond where lesscommonly read books were stored . He scanned the shelves idly , took down a heavy brass-bound tome , opened the catch , and lifted back the wooden cover . Myth and Legend of Alyafaleyn : the title was all but gone . He turned the brittle pages carefully , until , suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with demon faces danced in the margins : mist wraiths ! Tamborel took the book to a nearby table and began to read the text . " Some versions of the myth state that the wraiths dance at the edge of the world , while others say end , " a note explained . " But all versions agree that the edge or end in question is the Jagged Mountain range . One of the earliest versions of the myth speaks of a mortal dancing at our world 's end . This gave rise to the pop ular belief that if a mortal should ever dance with  | the mist wraiths , it would somehow bring about the ruination of our world . This in turn gave rise to the ancient law ( still in force ) that forbids all travel to those desolate peaks . " Tamborel slammed down the book and fled . That night , he could not sleep . His nightmares had subsided over the months . Sometimes he 'd gotten so absorbed in books and tuning with Silwender that he 'd gone days scarcely thinking of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dancing with the mist wraiths seemed less real , his fear unfounded . But now , with so many sick and in need .. . Tamborel sat up , hugging his knees . Since Caidrun had vanished , the whole world had gone awry , and fair skies were but a memory . Virtually the last time he 'd enjoyed such was on that last evening with Caidy by the minnow brook . Such a peaceful time that had been , and full of promise . They had burned the hateful helmet and he had tuned his first faleyn . Of course , Caidy , not content to just savor the moment , had picked things apart , arguing as to what the heynim were and where they came from . She 'd actually talked of tracing them back to their source . It 's a thought .. . An ingenious one , from the finest mind in Fahwyll ... . Tamborel froze , remembering the book he 'd read that morning .  | ... if a mortal should ever dance with the mist wraiths , it would somehow bring about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vanishing . Of her threats : I 'll show all of you who Caidy really is , just wait and see . Everything was dying . Soon they would not know what was the season , or even whether it was day or night . The ruination of our world ! " Oh , Caidy , what has happened to you ! What have you done ! " Tamborel slipped from his bunk and , throwing his blanket about his shoulders , went to sit in the passage outside . It was unthinkable . But he had thought it . Tamborel sat , staring at the floor until a light tap on his shoulder started him up . " I ca n't sleep either . " Keiryn sat down alongside , hugging himself against the chill . " What 's wrong ? " " I can not say . " Tamborel shivered . " It 's Caidrun , is n't it ? Is it very bad ? " Tamborel nodded . " Is she . . . dead ? " Tamborel hesitated . He 'd nursed his fears so long . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he dared not tell Silwender . Perhaps if he shared his fear with Keiryn , it would shrink in the telling . " It 's just shout as bad as that . But if I say what it is , you must promise not to tell . " Of course , Keiryn knew hardly anything , so Tamborel started front the beginning ,  | from Silwender 's visit to Fahwyll before Caidrun was born , right up to the evening at the brook . Without pause , he described the fight at the well , and how he 'd betrayed Caidrun by doing absolutely nothing . Keiryn shook his head . " I ca n't believe they 'd treat a baby so harshly . Not that I blame you , " he added hastily . " You were too small yourself to stop them . And you did what you could . " " But I joined them in the end , " Tamborel said bitterly . " I let things ride . I did n't stick by her  --  me , her one true friend . " " Tamborel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you time to make amends . Do n't be so hard on yourself : you came all this way to find her . It 's no use telling you not to worry , but did n't you say how sharp and tough she was ? I 'll bet she 's safe somewhere , and still at odds with everyone . " Tamborel shivered now . " That is not what 's keeping me awake , Keiryn . " " Then what ? " " I think she 's done what she said she 'd do down by the brook : I think she went to seek the heynim 's source . " " You mean she traveled to the Jagged Mountains ? But it 's forbidden ! " " That would n't stop Caidy . " Tamborel jumped up . " Keiryn , I have to go after her . " " But you ca n't . " Keiryn looked at him closely now . " Oh , Tamborel . There 'll be such trouble . And danger ,  | too . Look , why do n't you just wait till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said slowly . " They wo n't end , Keiryn . Spring will never come at this rate , and neither will she . Because . . . I think ? " He stopped , then pressed on again firmly . " I think the two are connected . I think she not only went to seek the heynim 's source . I think she found it . I believe that Caidy is mixed up in all our troubles . " " You ca n't be serious  --  yes , yes , I see you are . " Keiryn whistled . " All that fuss about her scattering other people 's clusters  --  she does sound precocious . But  --  you 're not suggesting she 's the reason why the new ones have n't come these past two years ? " It did sound preposterous , put so plain . But , then , Keiryn did not know Caidy . " The more we speak of it , the surer I feel it in my bones . I have to go , I know it now . Promise me again that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's so cold ! You 'll not get out of Minavar on foot in these rains . " He leaned forward , his arms tight-wrapped around his ribs . " Unless I go too . " " No ! " Tamborel said sharply . Then added more mildly , " Why ? " " I 've ridden qarlim all my life . We 'll borrow one and ? " " No . " Tamborel raised a hand . " You asked to hear my trouble , Keiryn . Not to bear it . " Keiryn almost smiled . " But you do n't ride , and  | you 'll go nowhere on foot . A qarl can take us wherever you want to go , even in the rains . " " But I go to the Jagged Mountains . " Fear flickered in Keiryn 's eyes . " Then so do I. " Tamborel pointed . " What about your heynim out in the rains ? " " I 'd stow them in a bag . That 's what the zjarns do right now when they go out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jagged Mountains : let 's say I 'll go as far as I am able . " Tamborel shook his head . " What if you stopped halfway ? There 'd be no turning back for me . So how would you survive out there alone ? And how would you get back here without a beast ? " Keiryn shrugged . " Where I come from they say you cross a brook one stone at a time . Let 's get started . " From then on , they ate sparingly , saving what they could , stowing scraps of dried fruit , hardtack and biscuit under their mattresses . Keiryn stole out to the stables and earmarked a sturdy beast . Then one afternoon , about a week after their talk , they stepped unnoticed from the crowded healing hall . While Tamborel packed their gear , Keiryn stored his heynim . Wrapped against the elements , they strode boldly to the stables . No one questioned them as Keiryn fitted a double saddle to the qarl and led the beast across the outer courtyard . " We go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tamborel , striving to sound calm . Old Kowl the gatekeeper let them through with grunt and a nod and scuttled back into the shelter of his booth . Heads down , bodies bent into the driving rain , Tamborel and Keiryn passed through the gate and down into the streets of Minavar.  | After only a couple of hours , it got too dark to travel farther . Slipping from the qarl 's back , they huddled under a makeshift shelter  --  their capes tied together  --  and nibbled at their rations . " I 'm surprised to find a road out here , " Tamborel remarked . He 'd pictured the plain totally devoid of traffic , save perhaps for wild beasts . " There are settlements on the plains , " Keiryn told him . " So I suppose the merchants need some kind of road to take supplies . We should be glad , for it will make our ride easier . " " How far does it run , do you know ? " " To the last settlement , let 's hope . World 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a day 's ride from the ranges . How do you feel , Tamborel ? " Tamborel 's rear was tender from the saddle , and Isis knees were stiff and sore . He shifted painfully . " . Just fine . But it 's the strangest thing : now we 're on our way , I feel better . " Even though the wind blew chill under their shelter , and the rain trickled down his back . Keiryn took a drink from the water bottle , handed it across . " It 's because you feel at last you 're doing something , probably . You 've been getting more and more frustrated shut up in the Hon'faleyn this past year and some . Not all the time , but I 've seen it conk in gusts . " That was true . Trust Keiryn to have noticed . Just beyond , the qarl shifted , seeking longer grass . Tamborel marveled that it could make itself so comfortable out in such bleak weather . " This place is no place even for a beast . You must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It crossed my mind an hour or so back . lint I 'm really glad I came . " " You ca n't be serious . " " Oh , it 's true . For one thing , I 'd never have her able to sleep nights , if I 'd let you come alone . Fur .111 other , I 've never done anything daring before . My ' folk kept me on a tight rein , you know ' ? They said my constitution was n't strong . " " And they sent you to become a zjarn ? " Zjarns had  | to be strong to risk the open road , and to endure in all kinds of places . " Silwender 's a zjarn , and see how fragile he looks . " Tamborel grinned . " We all know differently . But coming with me took a different kind of strength , Keiryn . " " Do n't I know it ? " Keiryn laughed dryly . " I confess I 'm in two minds , still . Remember the discussion we had about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threat or a prediction ? ' Those who go beyond the peaks shall never have a heyn . ' The thought of going even near them scares me . " " You can turn back , you know . It 's not too late . " " No ? " Keiryn retorted . " At this point , I 'd rather scale the highest peak than face Silwender . " It took two days to reach Westerly , their first sign of human life since quitting Minavar . Almost halfway to the foothills , the settlement was about the size of Pridicum , only rougher and run-down . The qarl slipped and slid the length of the rain-lashed street , in one end and out the other . No one saw them : who would , through those tight , dark shutters ? His bones and muscles aching from long hours in the saddle , his raw , chafed skin afire , Tamborel rode behind Keiryn , head down , while water poured off his hood , cascading down his back . They spoke little , for to turn or tilt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grateful for his friend 's presence . And the gesture had moved  | him deeply . Who else would have left the Hon'faleyn to risk this road and certain censure on return ? They pressed on over sodden plain . Where the road dipped , the water was so deep it nearly reached the qarl 's high barrel belly . And visibility was never more than a few paces in all directions . " How does the beast know where to tread ? " Tamborel called in Keiryn 's ear . Keiryn leaned back . " By instinct . And do n't let those spindly legs fool you . It could walk up a wall . " They pressed on , the rains unceasing , the skies getting darker , until at last they reached World 's End . With each step now , Tamborel 's desire to reach the mountains grew stronger . Caidy had made this journey on foot , propelled by her anger and bitterness . How she must have hated him . He made a little moaning sound in his throat . I 'm coming , Caidy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Miserable place . To think that people live behind those walls . " Tamborel glanced around . The shacks were scarcely visible behind thick sheets of rain . The end of the world . The end of the road , at least . Tamborel peered ahead , shivering convulsively . But they had his instinct to guide them still  --  a needle to a magnet that grew stronger with every step . Keiryn reined in the qarl . " One more day , Tamborel . And only half that to reach the first foothills " He sounded nervous .  | Tamborel felt nervous , too . Scared and excited , both at once . He nodded back toward the shacks . " You can stop here , if you like . " " Never , " Keiryn said . He nudged the qarl along . Around midday , the ground began to rise . All at once , Tamborel felt a wave of energy flash through him . From somewhere deep inside , a strange , familiar tingling surged , breaking out onto his skin . Then , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rubbing his arms . " Did you feel that ? " he shouted , into the wind . " Feel what ? " Tamborel opened his mouth , closed it again . Chimes , he 'd swear . He swallowed his excitement , reluctant now to share it . Keiryn slued around . " Let 's stop . Rest up for our last leg . " Stop ? Tamborel could push on now all day and night ! Their eyes met . " If you want , " Tamborel began . If you want to back out now , I will not blame you , he meant to say , but quit . If and when Keiryn 's nerve finally deserted him , he would confess it in his own good time . " If you want , " he repeated , checking his impa-tience . Keiryn looked relieved . They went on a little farther , watching for the meager shelter of bush or tree . " See : over there . " Keiryn pointed left . Off the track a short way loomed a smudgy mass , a ramshackle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the rain bouncing off his back in pellets . They scrambled down and ran . Keiryn knelt and put his hand to the man 's brow . " He has the moldy fever . " They carried him inside between them and laid him on a cot beside the fireplace . Tamborel straightened , breathing through his mouth . The air was foul . The place was squalid , with leaky roof and sooty walls but , glory , glowing embers in the hearth ! While Tamborel stirred the ashes and threw on wet wood , Keiryn stripped the man of his wet clothes and tucked the covers over him . " There , that 's better . Look , Tamborel . His heynim . " He shook a kerchief loose , and out popped four intyl . Their shine was almost gone , their chiming barely audible . Freed , they sank down to hover by the man 's head . " In their last hours , by the look of it . And so is he , if we do n't do something . Tamborel , we must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ End ? We 'll lose a whole day ! " The log began to smolder , filling the room with smoke . In a spasm of coughing , Tamborel knelt and blew on the log , coaxing up a meager flame . " Tamborel , he badly needs a zjarn . " " Can you see one living in that hole ? We 'll tend to him ourselves . " " How ? We do n't tune faleyn yet ? " Keiryn broke off , then exclaimed eagerly . " You ! You know how . You can use my cluster . " He patted the hag at his belt . What could Tamborel say ? The faleyn that he  | tuned were not for sickness of the flesh . But Keiryn did not know that , for Silwender had forbidden him to tell . Keiryn assumed with all the rest that he practiced to be a regular zjarn . Oh , what to do ? " I 'll try . " Keiryn unhitched his bag , shook out his heynim into the room , pulled them in to hover between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature of each heyn . Where to start ? Tamborel thought back to his last bout with the moldy fever , how clean and cool and soothing Silwender 's chimes had felt . He closed his eyes and set to work . " He 's cooler . You did it , Tamborel . " Keiryn stood and stretched . Gray light filtered through cracks in the ceiling , picking out the grimy contents of the shack . A table , a chair . Two lamps . Some pots that had not been washed in an age . The man stirred and groaned . " What now ? " Keiryn said . Indeed . All night , Tamborel had thought of Caidy . Of how close they were and how soon they would be face to face . Now this . He wanted to pick up and be gone . Why , they might reach the ranges by midday . But how could they leave at this point ? The moldy fever had a nasty habit of returning . To run out now would be wrong . " He needs broth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  beside the door . In it was dry bread , a heap of sour butter , and a lump of greasy cheese . And some wrinkled roots  | gone soft . Tamborel laid the vegetables on the table : not much to work with . " He wo n't need a zjarn now , but he still needs tending . " " It will take only one . " Keiryn found a paring knife , began to scrape a root , exposing bright orange flesh . " I 'll stay . You go  --  now . Be quick , you 're wasting daylight . " Tamborel could scarcely mask his eagerness . " You 're sure ? " Keiryn was sure , all right . In fact , he seemed relieved . " Hurry back . I hope your Caidrun is as light as you say , or we 'll have to take turns walking back to Minavar . " Tamborel slung on his cloak and looked around the room . Now , at the last minute , he felt guilty . " Here , I 'll bring in more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the yard , carried in armfuls of blackened logs and stacked them on the hearth where they began to steam at once . Then he gathered up his things , went to the door and opened it a little way , letting in a slice of wind and rain . Impulsively , he strode inside and gave Keiryn a quick , farewell hug . " Thank you . You 're my best friend , next to Caidy . Stay warm and dry . I 'll try not to be too long . " " Remember how to call the qarl ? " Keiryn followed him to the door . Tamborel cupped his hands and shouted . " Co . . . me ! Co . . . me ! " The beast teetered up out of the water curtain , leaves puking from its muzzle , its jaws working . " Kneel ! " The qarl obeyed ,  | Tamborel mounted . " Do n't forget to hobble him when you stop to rest , or he 'll wander ! " Keiryn called from the open doorway . " For mercy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waving him back . Keiryn saluted in farewell , then finally closed the door . Tamborel nudged the beast on , up the slopes , Keiryn forgotten already . He gazed up into the thick gray sky . Back in the Hon'faleyn  --  when they could still be seen  --  the foothills had looked soft and round as cushions . At close quarters , they were covered in tussocks of wiry grass lumpy as cobbles and pocked with sharp gray stones . The way grew steeper , yet the qarl , with its unerring nose for safety , managed to find the easiest way , a narrow trail  --  a dried-up stream bed , probably  --  that cut over and around the slopes , marking the path of least resistance . And probably the longest one , too , Tamborel thought ungratefully . Four hours , and they had n't yet made the first big rise . As they climbed , the driving rains eased , and fine droplets of moisture hung in the air , drifting like curtains in the wind . A little farther on , Tamborel began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , but a faint , all-over pricking , the sort he 'd felt all those years before when watching Silwender 's approach along the Pridicum road . Almost there , Caidy . Could she tell ? The way grew steeper and trickier . While he  | could n't see them through the rainy mist , Tamborel knew the peaks were looming over them , and that this was a foretaste of what was to come . From his high chamber in the Hon'faleyn , the ranges had seemed ethereal , a mysterious deepening of the sky . And here was the reality : treacherous rock slope that had even the sure-footed qarl stumbling about . He urged the beast on over a low spur , only to fetch up , sharp , on a chasm 's brink . Off to the left , a narrow ridge of rock arched like a rainbow to the chasm 's far side . He slid down off the qarl 's back and leaned out over the chasm 's edge . Misty rain fell away down , no sign of the bottom . Tamborel swallowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surface of that natural stone span was round , not flat ; that it was less like a bridge , more like the fossilized rib of some ancient , monstrous beast long since swallowed by the chasm .... Pulling himself together , Tamborel took the qarl 's bridle and edged toward the narrow span . The qarl , endowed with natural good sense , resolved to go in the opposite direction . There followed an epic tug-ofwar until , in the end , the beast 's training prevailed and Tamborel managed to drag it across by main force . By the time they were over , Tamborel 's knees were weak , and he was drenched in sweat . He mopped his face , looking around . It was getting dark . But he did n't want to stop that close to such a treacherous  | drop , so he remounted and moved on . By the time they crested the first big rise , it was so dark that the qarl tripped , almost tumbling them down the other side . Tamborel dismounted and led the beast on to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huddled in his cape and missing Keiryn . He nibbled on a crust , took a swig of water , then , utterly exhausted , keeled over and fell asleep . It was just dawn when Tamborel awoke . " Though you can hardly tell , " he declared loudly . The sky was dark , the air thick with mist and rain , just as in his nightmares . No sign of the qarl . " Co . . . me ! " There was no response . Of course . He had n't hobbled it . Do n't forget , Keiryn had warned him . Or it will walk . Tamborel began to cast around , peering through the murk , calling " Come ! " in growing exasperation . All at once , he halted . There was something familiar about this place ; the lie of the turf , the small rocks jutting out . He whirled about in alarm . Nothing . A shiver went up his back , as , all at once , he had the feeling that someone watched him . He turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ column of mist had risen from the turf and was floating toward him . A mist wraith ! He made to flee , then checked and fearfully stood his ground . " Caidy ? " The column writhed and twisted , dancing toward  | him . Another moment , and they 'd touch , thought Tamborel , powerless to move . But as he made to close his eyes , the column spiraled up and vanished on the wind . As Tamborel stood , his heart jumping , his breath coming tight and fast , new forms rose from the same spot and coiled toward him . As in a dream , he advanced to that place , then halted , feeling an icy draft : At his feet , a ragged hole and steps leading down .  | Tamborel leaned over , peering into the depths . His dream  --  exactly ! The steps fell steeply , vanishing into the dark . Deep-cut and narrow , they were worn concave in the middle from much use . They were also in great disrepair : cracked and crumbling at the edges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Swinging his legs over the edge of the hole , Tamborel tested the top step . It wobbled slightly , but held . He started on down , step by careful step . As he went , the tingling in his skin grew stronger . Caidy was down there , he just knew it . Caidy  --  and the chimes ! Six steps down the light was gone . He glanced back  | up , blinking at the falling mist . The sky was a ragged gray patch , small and far away . Six more steps , and even that was gone . Tamborel put a hand to his chest , feeling stifled suddenly , as he had at times in the shuttered Hon'faleyn . He fought the urge to scramble back up to the surface , and the panicky thoughts flashing through his mind . What was he thinking of ! What if the steps caved in ? What if he lost his footing and toppled down  --  how far would he fall ? He closed his eyes and , shutting out his fears , focused instead upon Caidy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mold , slowly , deliberately , in and out , until he felt his spirit rising . Then he carried on . As he went deeper , excitement , not panic broke his careful calm . Any moment now he and Caidy would come face to face ! He could almost feel Caidy throw herself upon him : " Oh , Brel ! I thought you 'd never come ! " The air grew more chill , and rank . Yet the deeper he went , the higher his energy surged . Icy air headed on his cloak , yet inside it he began to feel hot . Steps gave way to tunnel floor sloping gently down . Tamborel picked up pace until , all at once , be r.rn blind smack into . . . a wall ? He groped about , traced rusty hinges . And at the other edge , a massive ring : the latch . Not a wall : a door , heavy as a monsoon door only made of wood . He raised the latch , tried to turn it , but it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hole . He put his mouth to the hole and called . " Hall  --  oo  --  hoo ! " His shout rang up the passage . The echoes faded . Deep silence . He bent again , and put his ear to the hole . A moment later , he exclaimed softly . Chimes ? He held quite still , not breathing , fixed on the space behind the door . Yes , chimes . Faint  --  not faraway . Muffled . Chimes ! Tamborel called through the keyhole . " Hall . . . 0000 ! " Then he held his breath , straining to hear . Quiet , then , all at once , a rush of chimes as though another , farther , door had opened then closed on them again . Feet crunched over stone , closer , closer . Someone was coming ! A bolt slid back . Tamborel braced himself . The door creaked open , torch light flickered in the widening gap . A pause , then the door swung wide . On the open threshold stood a slight figure draped in shawl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door catch , the other held a torch aloft . Tamborel blinked and looked again : a thick mop of dark , bushy hair shadowed the stark white face . " Caidy ! " For one heartbeat , Caidrun stood , looking up at him , lips parted , eyes wide with shock . Tamborel 's heart leapt , catching something else . She was glad to see him , overjoyed , in fact ! He took a step , reaching  | for her hand . At that  --  it all happened so fast  --  she shoved the torch at him , grabbed the door , and began hauling it shut . " Caidy  --  no ! " Tamborel dodged the flame , and threw himself against the door , meeting the force of her resistance . Enraged , she thrust the flame at him again and this time he felt the heat of it flap past his ear . And then he heard the heynim , a gigantic swarm swirling around her head , and trailing back into the dark beyond . He staggered out into the passage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuck out at arm 's length to keep him at bay , then she reached once more to swing the door shut . Her face : so white ! And her eyes , her clear blue eyes so dark and sunken in her face . " Caidy , do n't . I 've come all the way from Minavar . Are n't you glad to see me ? " She paused , the door almost closed . " I hate you ! How dare you come here now ! " The door whoofed shut , cutting off her chimes . Tamborel stared at it blankly . Move ! Before she bolts it into place ! He leapt , seized the door ring , twisted it , and pushed . The door gave , and he slipped through . She was ready with the brand , but this time so was Tamborel . I le seized it and held it out of reach . " Where have you been ? " She glared up at him , a gnarl of fury in her Ili , uat , " I tried to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all this time . " 218 219  | " Liar . " He looked around . " What is this place ? " " You 'd be surprised . " She looked sly now . Tamborel eyed her closely . Whatever else she had become , she was no mist wraith . " How can you live down here ? There 's no air , no light . There 's nothing to eat . " " Oh yes there is . And people . " Tamborel glanced into the darkness . More of Caidy 's fancies ? " Where ? " " Never you mind . " " Caidy , I heard chimes . " " Well , of course you did . " She pointed to the swarm above her head . " No , I heard more than that . Caidy , where ? " " Go away , leave ! " Tamborel shook his head . " When I 've just found you ? " She threw herself on him , pushing him back . " Why now , why now ! I hate you ! You left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true ! " Tamborel shouted . He went on , his voice lowered . " Caidy , I ran after you . All the way to Minavar . I even went to see Silwender . He told me to wait there , in the Hon'faleyn . He said you 'd come , that anyone with your gift would end up there . So I waited , and waited , until things got so bad I came to find you . " " Bad ? "  | " Oh , Caidy , it was so hard to get here through the rains . " " Rains ? " Caidrun sneered . " You think I do n't keep tally down here ? It 's way past monsoon time . " Tamborel lifted the edge of his cloak . " Feel this . The monsoons are still raging and no signs of letting up . Caidrun covered her ears . " Stop it . You lie . " " I never lie to you . " Tamborel pressed on . " Hardly any heynim came last year , and none came this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know ? Now they 're failing , the world 's falling apart . " He stepped forward , forcing her back now . " I suspected why , and now I know . The heynim are down here . You 've snagged them and stowed them yonder . Oh , Caidy , how could you ? " He moved to take her in his arms . Caidrun started back , her swarm bouncing off the rocky walls . " Do n't move another step ! " He stopped , reaching out his free hand . " Come to Minavar . Silwender can help you . We can both learn together . " " Learn ? " Hope came to her eyes , softening her face . But then it was gone , and the old look was back . " Why now , after all this time ? " " I told you . Things are really had up there . The crops failed last year . Now the rains wo n't end . People are hungry and sick . If this all does n't stop soon , it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me and everyone . Caidy , let me help you put things right  --  please ? " She pointed to the outer door . " Go , now . " " We 'll both go , after we 've released the heynim . " Tamborel pushed past her , holding the torch aloft . Shadows fled before him , over the rough stone floor . Then the far cave wall loomed , and in it , just as he 'd suspected , a deeply recessed doorway . " No ! " Caidrun ran ahead to block him . " I sha n't let you . " As Tamborel reached the door and bent to raise the latch , Caidrun tried to fight him off . " You 'll be sorry ! " she warned , but Tamborel scarcely heard . As his fingers touched the latch , the shimmering that had guided him there rushed through him like the foamy rapids in the brook . He seized the latch and twisted it . " No ! " Caidrun beat him with her fists , but Tamborel only tightened his grip and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ massive door swung open . Tamborel dropped the torch and fell against the door frame . Before him a solid mass of spheres crammed a space so vast he could not see the roof , could not guess how far back it stretched . Torches flickered from crevices in the walls to either side , the fitful flames reflected in the countless shiny spheres . And the noise ! He looked at Caidrun in horror . " And you say you do n't know what you 've done ? " Caidrun looked triumphant . " It 's quieter in Fahwyll now , I 'll wager . "  | " Fahwyll ! " Tamborel pushed away from the door . He pictured the lines of sick and hungry people , and Keiryn waiting with an old man who might he dead by now . " You fool , Caidy ! When did you last climb those steps ? " " Do n't call me a fool . I have n't , and I wo n't . " He seized her arm and shook her roughly . " Listen ! The world is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and you give me drivel about Fahwyll ! " He felt his anger rise , strove to control it . That would only make things worse . He took a breath , tried again . " For the past year or so I 've scarcely slept from worrying about you . I 've had the worst nightmares . " " Poor Brel . " Caidrun 's mouth curled . " You made your choice . " " Yes , I did . As I said , I followed you the very night you left , but you gave me no chance to find you . Caidy  --  trust me : the world is ending . Set the heynim loose . " " It wo n't work , Brel . You 're trying to make me feel bad , the way the others used to . I 'm not the fool you just called me . " Tamborel looked down on her tight , set face , at his wit 's end now . " Of course not . And I 'm for you , whatever you 've done . Caidy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hah ! " " Do you want the world to die ? " " Do n't be so dramatic , Brel . "  | Dramatic ! " I 'll make you see . " He seized her arm and , taking up the fallen torch , began to drag her to the outer door . Caidrun fought to pull away until , halfway there , she lashed out with her foot , nicking his shin . " Oh , you ? " Tamborel turned on her , wincing in pain , but Caidrun danced out of reach , taunting him as of old . " Poor Brel . Did it hurt ? Poor Brel , Brel the Heynless . Brel  --  go home ! " He straightened , looking at her sadly . " What you did was foolish , Caidy . You did n't know any better . But what you do now is evil . " He heard the hiss of her breath as she drew herself up . " Evil ? I 'll show you evil . Here : " The pent-up spheres behind her began to move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heynim burst through the door and streamed toward him , gathering speed .  | The shining pellets converged upon him , hiding Caidy from view . Casting the torch aside , Tamborel raised his arms to cover his face . All at once , the heynim checked , lurched , then came on again . He heard Caidy 's scream . " Brel  --  I can not stop them ! " She burst through the heyn-mass , hurling herself upon him . As their bodies collided , he threw out his arms , and down they went . His whole being recoiled from remembered pain . But this time , a part of him said , they 'd strike Caidy , piercing her to the hone . " No ! No ! No ! " It began as a shout , ended as a roar . With an almighty effort , he pushed her aside and  | knelt up , eyes closed , bending his mind to the oncoming fury . Time stretched . Then , in the space of an instant , the wall of sound rolled on toward him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flood . He braced , pushed his will against it , recoiled in shock . Another second , and the spheres would hit ! Back ! Back ! Over the tumult came a hum . The humming rose to a whine like that of a twister advancing across the open fields . Even as he strained , he covered his ears , grimacing with pain . Caidrun cried out , then all went dark . Tamborel lay on his back , gazing up at deep blue sky . Beside him , heynim jingled musically . Water rushed nearby . Someone stroked his head . " Brel . Brel , I 'm sorry .... " He opened his eyes . Caidy bent over him . The blue sky was gone , and the sound of the brook . All was dark , save for flickering firelight . He was lying on rock floor , his head in Caidrun 's lap . Above and beyond , the dim space was alive with spheres , the vanguard of the masses still jamming the inner cavern . " I thought you were dead . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , put his arms around her . " I 'm fine , Caidy . " It was all coming back now . The converging heynim . Caidy 's shout . " Brel  --  I can not stop them ! " If she had not halted their rush , then who ? He looked up at the seething canopy of spheres .  | She put her arms around him and squeezed . " You did it , Brel . You made a sort of . . . soundstorm . It was terrifying . Then you fell even though they did n't touch you and I thought ? " She dug her face into his chest . Tamborel stared up , surveying the shifting golden canopy . He had done that ? He remembered now how she 'd thrown herself upon him , recalled his terror as the spheres had shot toward them , the thought that Caidy would be hurt . He slid an arm about her shoulders . How light they felt , and fragile . What she needed was fresh air and sunshine , and good , solid food . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the chiming . Sitting there on that deep cold floor he felt content as he 'd not felt since they 'd left Fahwyll . Complete . Suddenly , he laughed . Caidy looked up , wary . " What , Brel ? " " Two halves , together again at last . " He brushed his hand lightly over her tangled , wiry hair . More like frytt-burrs than ever , he thought . She pulled away . " You snagged the heynim . You can hold on your own now . You do n't need me any more . " He grinned down at her . " You think that 's it ? You have no idea . We 're going to have so much fun , you and I. Wait till we get back to Minavar . You have so many new friends to meet : Keiryn , and Jareyd , Hewl , and Synla . They 're going to love you , Caidy , just see . "  | " You think so ? " " Bet on it ! " Caidrun leaned back against him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savoring the moment . Just as he 'd pictured it , finally . Above them , the heynim jostled and collided , setting up delicate , random harmonies . Tamborel gazed up , thinking . What he 'd just done : could he do it again ? He nodded the nearest intyl to him . It came ! " Caidy , look ! " Caidrun smiled . She let go , and shifted around , nestling into him . " Again , Brel . Again . " Tamborel snagged a second intyl , then a third . Now he pulled in a scattering of anintyl , then a fistful of omantyl . Caidy 's voice came , very low he could scarcely hear . " Music , Brel . Make music . " His breath caught in his throat . Oosiks , Brel . Oosiks . He closed his eyes , feeling Caidy 's warmth against him , and began to tune to the ancient fire of Caidrun 's deep , abiding wrath , threw on it the salt of bitterness . Sound sparks flew , the faleyn exploded , bursting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The chimes swelled , the noise was deafening . White wrath-fire flashed in the darkness , then faded to a dull red ache , and died to pale gray ashes , vanishing . In the lull , Tamborel spun a quiet skein of melancholy . Of Caidrun 's hopelessness , of his own days and nights of sadness and loss . The chimes drifted like a veil around the cavern . At last , he let the muted harmonies fade . Now the heyn-mass  | melted into randomness , quiet mourner milling after a wake . For a while they sat , then Caidy looked up , " oh , Brel . It was so bad . " " But it 's all gone now . " He took her hand and pulled them upright . " Come on . " " Tamborel , I dare n't . " He put his arm around her . " It 's all right . You 'll be fine . " " I 've done a wicked thing . " " Silwender will understand . " They started toward the outer door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You mean  --  there really are folk down here ? " " Oh , yes . They think I 'm one of them , though funny in the head , because I 'm so different . " So : she 'd been an outcast down here , too . . " They do n't know of the stair ? " " No . And I did n't tell them . " " Do they know about the heynim ? " " Yes , though not what I did with them . " She looked up at him earnestly . " Those people make them , Brel . " " Make them ! " So , he thought . Caidy had been right . And without benefit of book or teacher had traced them to their source . " How ? " " I ca n't say exactly . I 've seen some of what they do  --  though I 've never seen the mines . They lie really  | deep . But I 've been to the caves where they smelt the ore , and shape the spheres . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baskets to a huge cavern and have a sort of Gathering . It 's to release the heynim up a round hole like a chimney in the cavern roof . " When I learned about the Gathering , I found a gap in the chimney wall , at this level we 're on now . I blocked the chimney just above the gap . As the heynim floated up , I drew them out and hid them here . " " The chimney 's still blocked ? " Caidrun nodded . " Then we must clear it before we do anything else . " They took up torches and set off , the heynim trailing like a golden river . Presently , Tamborel felt a draft . Rock wall loomed across their path . " The chimney wall ? " Caidrun nodded . " See the gap ? " A ragged breach in the stone about waist height . Handing Caidrun his torch , Tamborel leaned into the gap . Just above his head was a solid plug of stones , tightly jammed together . He reached up , gripped a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avalanche . Way below , there came faint echoes of rock striking rock . The echoes died . The rock had finished falling . Tamborel poked his head cautiously through the gap . Way above , a speck of dull gray light . He ducked his  | head out again and stepped back , blinking mist droplets from his eyes . Now to release the heynim . " Ready , Caidy ? " " Oh , yes ! " Tamborel took her hands . Two years ' worth of heynim : never again in his lifetime  --  in anybody 's ! He 'd already tuned some of it to Caidy 's healing . And now ? " Caidy , close your eyes . " " What ? " " Hush . " Caidrun obeyed . As the heynim stream flowed past toward the chimney hole , he looped it spirally around them , until they stood inside a chiming , golden pillar . A small whirlwind sprang up about them , lifting their hair . At its touch , Caidrun 's hands tightened in his , but beyond that , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tamborel bent his full power to the swarm , pouring out all the wishes and hopes that he 'd kept in his heart for Caidrun since the beginning . The tunnel walls resounded with brilliant , joyous chiming as the heynim swirled around them then streamed on up toward the sky : a Grand Concatenation carrying all the way to Minavar ! Long after the last heyn had passed , they stood locked together in the spell of those chimes . Way above , wind soughed in the hollow chimney . Presently , Caidrun sighed and stirred against him .  | " How quiet it is , " he murmured . Eerie , with all the chimes gone . Yet he did n't feel unease . He pictured the seemingly endless swarm racing down toward the plain . Keiryn catching the first faint notes and running out to witness that wondrous swarm sweep eastward . Keiryn . Then the outermost settlers . Then Minavar . Tamborel smiled up into the darkness . The whole world caught up in a song of love as could never come again . " I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once , she began to laugh . " What is it ? " She pointed to the empty space above his head . " Brel the Heynless ! " Then she pointed at herself . " Caidrun the Heynless , too . I let mine go with the others . I 'll have to start from scratch , along with you . Here : this can be your very first one . " She pulled an intyl from a pocket and held it up with finger and thumb . " Silwender 's , " she said , nodding it toward him . " I stowed it so I would n't lose it in the mass . " " Caidy , I ca n't . " " Please . " The little thing bobbed and dipped around his head , its familiar tones tinkling good as new . " Thanks . " " Now , " Caidrun went on briskly . " I have to go and take my leave . I 'll tell them about the stairway now , though they likely wo n't believe me. "  | Tamborel thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were , how they had core to hr down there , how they had forgotten about the stair . He grew curious . " Shall I go with you ? " " I 'd rather do it alone , if you do n't mind . " She looked away . Saying good-bye was not going to he wholly easy , Tamborel thought . Even it they had thought her strange , someone had been kind , had III and clothed her . And she wanted to keep it private , for now . " Very well . I 'll wait for you up here . Maybe it 's best to leave them to Silwender , anyway . " News of thew folk would rock the Hon'faleyn to its foundations , he thought , as Caidrun took his hand , towing him along .
