" His music was never overexposed at the time he was making it , " says Blackwell . " He always maintained an underground feel , and so each new listener has that sense of discovery . That 's what keeps him on the edge . That and the fact it 's incredible music . " <P> Marley , who died of cancer in 1981 at age 36 , brought the Third World to the whole world . The dirt streets of the Jamaican slum of Trench Town , the myths and tales of the Caribbean , the wisdom and fire of the Old Testament  --  he drew from it all , creating reggae music , rebel psalms , that rang with poetry and prophecy . Romance , for him , was not incompatible with revolution ; bullets and ballads were both the stuff of his work . He envisioned a world beyond this one but never lost sight of the horrors and joys of the here and now . " If you know what life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look for yours on earth . "
