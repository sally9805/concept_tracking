<p> Everybody knows this is nowhere near the 1960s , but a lone diehard rock rebel is resuscitating guitar feedback , passionate caterwauling , unrestrained jams and warts-and-all rawness . <p> In this era of factory-perfect pop , Neil Young follows a different drum . The kind you do n't plug in . The uncompromising primal rock on his current album , Ragged Glory ( Reprise ) , is n't music you 'd expect to kick the computer- run ' 90s into orbit . <p> It 's brash , defiantly uncommercial , passionate and blithe , much like Young himself . He rocks out with a commitment and energy unmatched by punk wailers half his age , yet Young , 45 , is quick to paint himself an elder statesman . <p> " Our parents were into Frank Sinatra and Rosemary Clooney and Perry Como - now I 'm Perry Como , " he jokes , sipping coffee in a secluded corner of the Loews Hotel restaurant . Clad in a plaid flannel shirt and petrified wood bolo , he could be mistaken for a farmer , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> But Young is no mellowing middle-ager , and it 's inconceivable that he could wind up an enervated lounge lizard . More likely , he 'll become the octogenarian rocker he portrays in his Mansion on the Hill video . <p> " I 'll probably live to be 85 , and they 'll have to pull me off the stage with chains , " he says , confiding , " I 'd like to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame but not be able to attend because I have a gig . " <p> A prolific maverick , Young surprised his fans , his record label and himself by delivering Ragged Glory , his 25th solo release in 21 years , less than a year after 1989 's Freedom . <p> Immersed last spring in cataloging and remastering tapes for an upcoming career-spanning compilation , Young was suddenly gripped by an urge to live in the moment . He composed Ragged Glory during a 10-day solo frenzy . <p> " I played the songs in a big empty barn with old cars and junk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bay , an hour south of San Francisco , with wife Pegi . He has three children , Ambergine , 6 ; Ben , 12 ; and Zeke , 18 . " I did n't have a mike . I just sang to myself with the guitar blaring all around me . " <p> He summoned his longtime Crazy Horse sidemen - guitarist Frank " Poncho " Sampedro , bassist Billy Talbot and drummer Ralph Molina - and they recorded the songs live during three weeks of loose and joyous sessions at Young 's 2,000-acre ranch . On the last day , Sampedro prodded Young to play something from his high school days . He obliged , attacking the primitive Farmer John , a 1964 Premiers hit . <p> " Crazy Horse had never played it before , " Young says with childlike amazement . " Nobody knew what key it was in . We played it anyway . That was the only time we played it , that version on the record . You ca n't do a song like that today . It would be dumb , stupid and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regularly returns to scorched-earth rock and Crazy Horse . Their first collaboration , 1969 's Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere , produced the timeless Cowgirl in the Sand , Down by the River and Cinnamon Girl . <p> Two decades later , " it jelled better than ever , " Young says . " The one unifying thing we all felt is we have n't peaked . " <p> So why did he stray from Crazy Horse for solo outings like Old Ways ( country ) , Everybody 's Rockin ' ( rockabilly ) and Trans ( sci-fi pop ) ? <p> " The Crazy Horse stuff is really good because there 's time off between , " he says , acknowledging that fans and critics consider Crazy Horse his strongest allies , outranking even Crosby , Stills and Nash . " My other albums , while not always as successful as my work with Crazy Horse , have given me depth and experience . I bring that back to every rock ' n ' roll record . " <p> Rankled at being abandoned , Crazy Horse airs its grievances in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , featuring Talbot , Molina , singer Sonny Mone and guitarist Matt Piucci . <p> " Neil has the privilege of being a solo artist who can come back to us when he wants , " Talbot says . " In the meantime , we ca n't wait around . We 're not just side musicians . It 's not that we got mad . We turned the situation into motivation to make our own album . " <p> Talbot concedes the chemistry with Young is potent , and he 's excited about their U.S. tour , starting Jan. 20 in Minneapolis . " When we 're playing , we have a street-gang attitude , " he says . " Neil 's one of us . We 're not inhibited by his presence . And we 're not afraid to take off and keep rocking . " <p> Young creates - sometimes willfully , sometimes accidentally - militantly unfashionable music . Ragged 's first single , Mansion on the Hill , enjoyed broad exposure , but with other songs stretching past 10 minutes , the album 's garage-band anarchy could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ games ( he makes videos , for instance ) , he seldom plays by the rules ( he makes videos MTV wo n't play ) . He filmed a performance of Ragged 's most outrageous track , F# ! #in ' Up , " just for the experience of doing a cheap , sleazy video they ca n't play on MTV for a record they 'll never play on radio . " <p> Young ironically captured MTV 's 1989 video of the year award for This Note 's for You , a spoof on pop stars and commercial endorsements . MTV had earlier refused to air it , a painful event that inspired Days That Used to Be , with the lyrics : People say do n't rock the boat , let things go their own way/Ideas that once seemed so right now have gotten hard to say . <p> Young elaborates : " I wrote that song in the middle of the ocean on a Pacific crossing . I had n't seen anything for eight days , not even an airplane . Just 360 degrees of water and some whales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radio that MTV was n't going to play This Note 's for You , ( which ) cost $ 120,000 to make . It was a funny song , that 's all it was . I thought , ' How could I misjudge so gravely what I thought they 'd think was funny ? Am I so out of touch with the world ? ' " <p> Young did n't fume long . In fact , rage is conspicuously absent on Ragged Glory . <p> " My rock ' n ' roll music has been intensely angry for the past 10 years , since Rust Never Sleeps , " Young says . " Somehow I turned a corner . The anger went out the window , thank God . I knew it would happen eventually . It 's paradise . " <p> Ragged arrives in an era of declining rock ' n ' roll , a drift that has n't alarmed Young . <p> " There never were a lot of rock ' n ' rollers , " he says , drawing a distinction between it and rock . " Rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rock ' n ' roll is raw , undiluted , unprocessed . It 's real chemistry . It 's us and a lot of unknown bands . Bands like Modern Lovers make rock ' n ' roll . They 're not putting out a fashion line . They 're not trying to be perfect . They can hardly play , for Christ 's sake . They 've got that in common with us . " <p> Young is planning another LP with Crazy Horse . His retrospective , so massive it may be released in separate volumes , may be out by late 1991 . For the upcoming tour - sponsored by Farmer John Bacon , he kids - Young wants to build a huge stage prop . <p> " A horse , " he says . " It 'll be the first tour you can smell . "
