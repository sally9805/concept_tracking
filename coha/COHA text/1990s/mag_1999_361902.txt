HELPING BUYER BEWARE Home buyers with a government-backed mortgage should no longer be blindsided by costly repairs come Aug. 1 . New rules set by the Federal Housing Administration , which will insure 1.3 million new mortgages this year , make appraisers responsible for detecting big defects such as a faulty furnace or a bad roof  --  and put the sellers on the hook for fixing them . Buyers will still be urged to hire an inspector for a more thorough review of the property . <P> BONDING WITH UNCLE U.S. savings bonds are Melba toast on anybody 's investment plate . And for thousands of holders , they 're even less tasty . There are nearly 18 million savings bonds afloat ( $6.6 billion worth ) that are no longer earning interest . These patriotic bondholders are giving Uncle Sam a free loan .
