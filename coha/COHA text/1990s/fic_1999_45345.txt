We named her Radioactive Rose the summer of 1958-the summer I turned eleven , the summer of the seventeen-year locusts . I heard them coming : the clack of the castanets , the shake of the tambourines , the menacing , metallic rattle that grew louder and more agitated until they poured down out of the sky , deafening us inside their pandemonious squabbling . No matter how many we killed , they kept coming in torrents . When it was all over , they lay in deep , murmuring piles , burying us in a terrible cockroach-like heap . I can still see their squashed yellow insides oozing out of their brown , potato-chip-like remains <p> I 'll never forget how she got the name . It was late July . My grandmother , Bubbe , was driving Aunt Rose home through the South Chicago suburbs hardest hit by the locusts . Suddenly , Aunt Rose heard a ticking sound , like a Geiger counter , in her ear . " Get me home fast , I 'm radioactive , " she screamed . Aunt Rose was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called her , so I called her that too ) . Bubbe tried to hide her smile , but when Radioactive Rose 's panic escalated , Bubbe shrieked , " Oy , do n't worry , it 's nothing . " But Aunt Rose pleaded with Bubbe : " Lean over , lean over , you can hear it . " Bubbe bent across the front seat , barely able to steer , and , sure enough , there was a sound that seemed to come from her sister 's ear . " I 'm radioactive , radioactive , hurry , hurry ! " Aunt Rose screamed . Bubbe floored it . <p> When they arrived home , Aunt Rose ran in and stripped . Uncle Isaac laughed and told Bubbe that he had n't seen his wife completely naked in years . Upon inspection , Uncle Isaac and Bubbe found a locust lodged in Aunt Rose 's dress . Bubbe laughed so hard her false teeth almost jumped out of her mouth . Uncle Isaac missed the locust a few times as it whirred wildly around the bedroom , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her inimitable sighs-a combination of angst and relief . <p> " It 's like a cancer , " Aunt Rose said of the invasion . " They come in and take over everything . I hate infestations . " Rose Feinberg Singer was Bubbe 's youngest sister . Rose-one of ten brothers and sisters and young enough to be my Mom-was my favorite great aunt . <p> For many years , Aunt Rose and Uncle Isaac lived on Pill Hill , a more or less exclusive South Side ghetto of predominantly Jewish doctors . In retrospect , I see what a perfect place Pill Hill was for my aunt . She thought it was common sense to live near doctors . She loved doctors . When her daughter , Beth , married Ben , a gynecologist , she was thrilled . Now she had one more doctor to go to . One more opinion ! Although Aunt Rose was a classic hypochondriac , I never agreed with the family that Aunt Rose started having more female problems right after Beth married Ben . <p> She was completely at home on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fright , moved to the northern or southern suburbs . After a black physician and his family bought a house on North Point , the so-called border of Pill Hill , the exodus started . " They are going to come in and take over the neighborhood , " her neighbors warned her . Aunt Rose held out a little longer than most of her neighbors . But , finally , Aunt Rose moved too . <p> Aunt Rose and Uncle Isaac moved near where my family lived in the southern suburbs of Heather Hills Marina , an exclusive new development fashioned from the flat , Midwestern prairie . Though Heather Hills had no heather , no hills , and no marina , it did have big , expensive homes with nautical effects . <p> I remember how excited I was that Aunt Rose lived right around the corner , but , at the same time , Aunt Rose seemed too citified to live in the suburbs . She 'd often say of Heather Hills : " There are n't enough Jews or doctors around ; it 's not the South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have no place to go back to . " One month after Aunt Rose and Uncle Isaac moved to Heather Hills , someone burned the words Dirty Jew into their front lawn . Aunt Rose and Uncle Isaac kept to themselves after that . <p> After they moved so close , we visited Aunt Rose often , usually every Tuesday . Mom and I would spend the afternoon there , after school and shopping . I loved it . Radioactive Rose flew around her big brand-new suburban house like a huge , trapped city fly . She was constantly in motion , constantly getting someone something , her shiny jet-black hair flurrying in the air . Jet-black , Semitic black , too black to be believable . But Mom swore Aunt Rose never dyed her hair : " Why should she have to ? She 's too young . " <p> If Aunt Rose had a mission in life , it was to feed people . Just like Bubbe , she always equated eating with happiness . As soon as we walked into her house , after the obligatory hugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I get you ? What do you want to eat ? What can I get you to drink ? " She had the biggest pantry full of junk food-Cheez-Its , Hostess Cupcakes , Hostess Twinkies , Jay 's Potato Chips-I had ever seen ! <p> We whiled away the late Tuesday afternoons eating junk food and kibitzing as the sun sank its prairie-gold head under the flat shelf of land . Conversing with Aunt Rose was like trying to catch a dog who was allowed loose outside for the first time . She 'd go this way , then she 'd go that , from one second to the next . " Ronnie should have never married Sheila , " she 'd comment . Minutes later , she 'd say : " Is n't Sheila a great wife for Ronnie ! " She was the only person I knew who could believe two contradictory statements at once . Whenever she made anyone laugh , she looked puzzled . Half the time I was sure she was putting us on , and the other half she seemed utterly sincere , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Yet , on occasion , usually toward the end of our visit , Aunt Rose would settle down . She 'd sit across from me at the kitchen table and put on her big black reading glasses so she could examine me like a book . As we talked , she 'd breathe me in and breathe me out . Occasionally , she 'd murmur : " Oy , what a beautiful faygeleh-what a doll . " <p> Though she was never seriously ill , each week Aunt Rose discovered a new symptom that might indicate a fatal disease . When Aunt Rose 's back grew discolored from her incessant scratching , it took seven doctors to convince her it was not skin cancer . Still , every month , her husband took a close-up Polaroid of her back so that she could inspect the suspicious spot to make sure that it was n't spreading . <p> I would worry and ask Mom for reassurance , " What 's wrong with Aunt Rose ? Is she gon na die ? " Mom answered , " Nothing , it 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " How are you feeling today , Aunt Rose ? " is the way I often started a conversation with her . She would force a tight-lipped smile and pretend nonchalance , while wanting all the sympathy she could get . " Oy , I do n't know , my shoulder 's been bothering me today . Maybe I have fluid on the shoulder .... Maybe it 's the weather , " she 'd say doubtfully . Or , she 'd point down toward her crotch and moan : " My womb 's been aching . " I 'll never forget her telling me she had a pain in her womb , even though I was too young to understand what she meant . No one but Bubbe had ever talked to me like that . <p> After disclosing the source of her pain , she would question me with her dark , gimlet eyes . She had the habit of always looking up at whomever she was talking to , drinking in their response . To me it was a look that said I knew what was wrong with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or die . It was a look of concern , first for me and then for her . So , half the time she appeared a concerned mother and the other half a frightened child . <p> One Tuesday in early September of 1960 , I rushed home from school in anticipation of our weekly rendezvous with Aunt Rose , but Mom stopped me at the door and said , " Why do n't you come to the Jewel with me , Joanne . I need to pick up some things for dinner . " <p> " But what about Aunt Rose ? " I asked . <p> " Oh , Aunt Rose had to go to the hospital for some routine tests and then she and Uncle Isaac might take a vacation , so we might not see her for a few weeks , " she answered . <p> " Funny , she never said anything to me , " I said . <p> I soon learned that Dr. Epstein , Aunt Rose 's doctor , had found a large lump in her left breast . The biopsy results were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He told him that the lump was big , one of the biggest he had ever seen , and it was malignant : " We have to go in there and try to take it all out . She will probably lose her left breast . " After the operation , Dr. Epstein said , " I think we got most of it , most of what was spreading . " <p> Aunt Rose went in and out of the hospital for radiation and chemotherapy . " Be careful , do n't touch me ; I 'm really radioactive ! " she 'd half joke . <p> Bubbe said , " We have to take the name Radioactive Rose ' off her . " <p> No one , not even the doctors , said " cancer . " Instead , they sometimes mumbled " malignant . " <p> When the cancer spread to her lymph nodes , Uncle Isaac told her she had to go back to the hospital to take a special class that might cure her . Aunt Rose enrolled in North Lake Hospital 's Positive Mental Attitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its kind . The teachers told her that fear kills . Everyone in class got their own box of colored pens and as much drawing paper as they wanted . At first Aunt Rose said she could n't draw , but the teachers said , " Try to draw to fight the bad cells . " Aunt Rose began a series of drawings that formed a storyboard that covered one wall of her hospital room . On the left side of each drawing were the cancer cells . They looked like cartoon cockroaches but with big , spindly , spider legs . There were so many of them , they were crawling on top of one another , eating the good cells . The good cells were crude , ultra-bright , yellow daisies with faces-a yellow circle with three black dots ( two for the eyes and one for a nose ) and a half-circle for a mouth . By the end of the story panel , the good cells had multiplied and had taken over the cancer cells . <p> Every time we visited there was a proliferation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawn on , I thought . How could they grow that fast ? <p> " It 's a real hard class , Joanne , " Aunt Rose confided . " I bet it 's as hard as college . I wish they 'd just give me more radiation , even if it makes me radioactive . What do I care . " Sometimes she giggled . But mostly she complained , " They 're driving me crazy , " and mimicked the teacher 's instructions , " Fight , fight , fight , kill , kill , kill those bad cells . " Hearing Aunt Rose speak so bitterly was as strange as tasting salt when I thought it was sugar . Still , I knew that Aunt Rose would survive . Hypochondriacs do n't die . If Mom said it , it had to be true . <p> Aunt Rose finally convinced her teachers in the PMA class that she did n't want to draw . The PMA instructors would not let Aunt Rose off the hook , though . They began teaching her a more passive form of creative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was always the same : The good and bad cells fought each other . She preferred this visualization class because she could do it lying down . She did n't have to go to class ; she simply had to check in with her counselor . <p> Her condition improved . The counselor said Aunt Rose had a vivid imagination . But one night Aunt Rose had a major setback . At 2:00 A.M. , when she could n't sleep , Aunt Rose decided to have an extra creative visualization session . The good cells , now happy , skin-colored amoeba shapes , were doing especially well against the bad bug infestation . Suddenly , out of nowhere , silver streaks , like flashing fish , started floating over the battlefield . They swam from one side to the other . All hell broke lose . Fireworks started going off in her head , and the good and bad cells went helter-skelter . When Aunt Rose opened her eyes , she could only see parts of the hospital room . She thought she was dying and that parts of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nurse . " I 'm dying , " she screamed through the nauseating blindness . <p> At 5:00 A.M. , after several injections of barbiturates , Aunt Rose slept . After Dr. Epstein ran tests to rule out a stroke or other complications , he informed Aunt Rose that she had had a severe migraine headache . Dr. Epstein ordered that she stop the class . Aunt Rose seemed relieved . She had never been that visual anyway , probably because her emotions had always been so powerful that they obliterated her other senses . <p> For eight months , every other day , Bubbe drove ninety miles to North Lake Hospital in Evanston to visit her sister . I 'd accompany her occasionally on the weekends although I hated hospitals . I think I was afraid of being contaminated . I was shy around my sick aunt , often afraid to look at her face-to-face , perhaps afraid of what I 'd see-maybe a bloody hole where a breast had been <p> Bubbe brought cheer to the hospital . She 'd try to raise her sister 's spirits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today . " The only color I saw was her lipstick-red lips , a pulsating , scarlet slug that seemed to move through the white hospital sheets as Aunt Rose raised and lowered them . Even fair-skinned Aunt Rose became more and more ashen in contrast to the blinding white of the hospital sheets . Next to them , she looked like day-old city snow . <p> " I do , I see more color in your cheeks today , " Bubbe repeated , trying to convince her sister . Aunt Rose applied a wan smile . She was losing her fear , but that meant letting go of her life . <p> Aunt Rose died at the end of December at the age of fifty-one on a bottomless , gray day . The cold , fall rains had wiped off all of nature 's makeup and the last leaves hung on the trees like loose , black scabs . I had just come home from school . Mom stood in our cramped vestibule where the telephone nook had been inconveniently built . She was slouching against the wall with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen my Mom cry . I lost control immediately and started sobbing . She covered the mouthpiece and looked down at me : " Your aunt has . . . , " she began . <p> I interrupted , " Mom , do n't worry , hypochondriacs do n't die . " <p> She looked annoyed and then spoke into the mouthpiece : " I ca n't believe it , I just ca n't believe it . We had our babies together , and now she is dead . " <p> I recently came across an old , faded , sepia-toned 1940s photo of Mom and Aunt Rose . They both look so young , so full of life , standing in front of the dark , somber Chicago brownstone apartments . On the shady sidewalk near SeventyFirst Street and Jeffrey on the South Side , Aunt Rose and Mom stand together posing and smiling in front of their respective baby-carriages , holding their firstborn babies , Daniel and me , up to the camera . Their handsome faces are surrounded by abundant jet-black hair , half-covered by full-sized babushkas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nervous about something . <p>
