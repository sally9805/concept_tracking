No one seems to know for sure whether General Norman Schwarzkopf leans right or left , Republican or Democratic , so forcefully does he assert that he 's an independent . Few have the least idea of what he thinks about monetary policy or school choice or quotas or global warming . Chances are , he favors a strong defense , though he has called war a " profane thing . " What is most interesting is not that no one knows , but that hardly anyone cares . <P> The virtue in Schwarzkopf 's mystery is that the general can be anything to anybody . Corporations look at him and see a take-charge CEO ; universities envision a powerhouse chancellor ; publishers perceive the author of a best- selling book . Above all , much of the public is enraptured by a new leader whose very appeal is that he has no platform , no party and no intention , at least so far , of running for office . Such political virginity lets people believe that Schwarzkopf , in his big , bold way , could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small pieces by its machinery . <P> When Schwarzkopf came home from the war zone last week , a crowd gathered before dawn to foil his attempt to sneak quietly back into the country at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa . The band played a victory march and the national anthem , and the fans wearing STORMIN ' NORMAN FOR PRESIDENT T shirts waved flags and yellow balloons as sea gulls wheeled overhead . " I ca n't describe to you the emotion that 's in all our hearts , " he said , with his first words on American soil in 239 days . " It 's a great day to be a soldier .

He could catch up with Jeopardy and Cheers . Come Sunday , he could go to a real church and sit in a pew without sand in his boots . And while he savored his privacy , Norman Schwarzkopf could lean back and let the rest of America ponder his future . <P> He says he plans to retire in August , an utterly tantalizing prospect for pundits , pollsters , politicos , agents and headhunters . " I 'll try and write a book , " he muses . " I do n't have the first line . Maybe , ' I was born at a very early age . . . ' How 's that ? " He will play grand marshal at the Kentucky Derby next month , and talks of becoming a first-class salmon fisherman and improving his sporting-clays shooting .
