Every now and then we become , inadvertently , a tiny part of a story we 're covering . That happened to us as the Dick Morris scandal unfolded . <P> It began two weeks ago when we were closing our cover story on Morris ' secretive relationship with Clinton , which White House correspondent Eric Pooley had been working on for two months . Morris became worried that he would appear on the cover along with Clinton , something that neither he nor the White House wanted . He called me late one night to say , in no uncertain language , that this would upset him , and the President as well . I told him I understood the concern but that it was up to us to choose our cover image . <P> That conversation took on more significance when Morris ' end of it was reported in the Star . Although the account was not entirely accurate  --  we did not change the cover to suit Morris  --  the story did provide evidence that the call girl who was the paper 's source was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ element of a public emergence that served to heighten Morris ' visibility and , subsequently , make his fall more newsworthy . In addition , he told colleagues he was upset with TIME 's characterization of him as , among other things , " a rogue . " <P> Thus I was surprised last Thursday , the day he resigned , when he tracked me down as I was waiting to go on the Charlie Rose TV show . It was an odd moment : sitting with another controversial consultant , Ed Rollins , and former New York Governor Mario Cuomo ( who were also waiting to go on the show ) , watching President Clinton give his acceptance speech on TV while listening to Morris on the phone complaining about our cover and then offering us another interview . <P> In his interview the next day , Morris adamantly declined to talk about the Star piece , and his motive was clearly to try to salvage his reputation as a political architect . Still , his perception of the role he played seemed revealing , and you can judge for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a noted lawyer , was much more willing to talk about the personal aspects of the brutal week . Both interviews , along with the story our political team put together on this odd saga and the analysis by Robert Wright of the values debate , offer , I hope , telling glimpses into the most amazing intersection of politics and personality we have seen this year .
