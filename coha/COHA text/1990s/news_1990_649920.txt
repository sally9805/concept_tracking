<p> The budget deficit facing Mayor David Dinkins has been estimated at between $1.5 and $2.5 billion for next year . While the city 's budget appears to be huge - $29 billion in its fiscal year 1992 - in fact , only $20 billion are city funds . The rest are Federal and state monies over which the Mayor has little control . <p> Of the city 's own money , over $2 billion is required to match Federal welfare and Medicaid funds - no comparable burden is placed on any other city in the country - and nearly $3 billion goes to fund debt service on money borrowed long ago . And the Mayor lacks discretion over much of the $15 billion remaining . <p> Close to $3 billion is used to pay for the pension of city workers , the costs of the city 's leases and fuel bills , and other items essentially outside the Mayor 's control . Being $2 billion short on a budget of $12 billion is as a close to a fiscal crisis as the city has been since 1975 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crime wave in the daily headlines and a million people living past the brink of poverty , the Mayor 's choices - and ours - will not be easy . They are not made easier by those who crab about his rhetoric or second-guess his timing of press conferences . What will the choices we make tell us about what kind of people we have become ? <p> First , we 'll find out how smart we are . It does n't take great ingenuity to raise taxes or cut services . What takes brains and commitment is improving productivity . Commissioners are paid to be effective , and in this crisis every one of them should cut their agency 's city-funded , discretionary budget by five percent without reducing services . Otherwise , we should get some new Commissioners . <p> Furthermore , can we afford to have four separate economic development agencies ? Should we continue to spend millions on redundant mini-bureaucracies for elected officials whose powers were reduced by the new charter ? Productivity could cut the deficit as much as half a billion dollars . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government by another one percent . Helping to avoid additional layoffs should stimulate their creativity . When services needs to be reduced by as much as $300 million , we 'll find out how much we care about the not-very-safe economic safety net that distinguishes New York from every other city in America . <p> We can slash programs for the middle classes and the wealthy - subsidizing museums , smoothing roads for those who drive to work , sweeping the streets in midtown - or we can increase class sizes in the early grades , close public health clinics and drop homeless housing programs . We can choose to keep the parks as clean as we would like and tolerate hospital emergency rooms that are Dickensian nightmares . <p> We can cut back on services to small businesses or we can drop poor children from daycare . We can accept third world infant mortality rates or start collecting garbage in some neighborhoods less frequently . <p> Economics textbooks tell us that localities should never have progressive tax systems , because wealthier people will vote with their feet and leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have tried to have a local tax structure that reflects our values as well as our pocketbooks . Now those beliefs will be tested . <p> When we add the billion dollars of new taxes that the next budget will require , who will pay them ? We should return to the 4.3% marginal rate on the city personal income tax that we had only a few years ago , rather that institute new , regressive taxes that give those with unearned income a free ride . <p> We need to change the property tax system that leaves a city homeowner paying less than half what a Nassau County homeowner pays for a house of equal value . And it 's time to use the tax system to discourage behavior we do n't like ( driving in midtown during the day ) rather than behavior we need ( poor people taking low-paying jobs to stay off welfare ) . <p> The lessons of the last decade should have taught us that for a society to function , sacrifice is required . New Yorkers have long understood this , and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wall Street and the government work together to save a city on the brink . Will those same players be able to set aside their parochial interests again ? <p> Can the public employees recognize that wage settlements will directly reduce the level of services for everyone else ? After all , the workers of Chrysler and The New York Post took pay cuts to save institutions somewhat less important . In today 's crisis , what " give-backs " are our labor leaders prepared to offer ? Perhaps it 's even time to offer some of the able-bodied adults on welfare small additional stipends to perform the work of laid-off civil servants . <p> Great universities , foundations and private hospitals should pay some taxes , or make " voluntary contributions , " toward the services they receive just as Yale now does for New Haven . Museum stores should pay sales tax when they sell the same luxury commodities as other merchants . Members of the city 's private clubs would feel less guilty about stepping over the homeless on their doorsteps if they gave up their tax exemption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too proud to start paying the same corporate income taxes as every other business . And is it right that the city should have to spend millions of dollars on tax auditors just to make big businesses pay the taxes they owe ? We 're waiting to hear more from the leadership of the private sector than threats to dive into the swamps of New Jersey . <p> Is New York still an assembly of people with a commitment to social justice as well as fiscal prudence ? Or has it become , as some have said , a city built on greed and gossip ? We will find out whether each of us is to live alone in this great city , or live together as New Yorkers.
