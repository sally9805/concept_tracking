<p> Gordon Wysong , who represents northeast Cobb on the County Commission , sparked the debate over family values and gay rights in Cobb County by introducing both measures . Mr. Wysong , 46 , is the owner of a firm that manufactures ceramic components for electrical and computer products . He is an 18-year Cobb resident and an Atlanta native . <p> Bill Cooper , who represents west Cobb , was the only commissioner to vote last week against a resolution condeming " the gay lifestyle . " He also says he wants to be sure a proposal to tie arts grants to family values is constitutional before voting for it . Mr. Cooper , 50 , is a commercial pilot and training instructor with Delta Air Lines . A California native , he has lived in Cobb for 5 1/2 years . <p> Last week , after the Cobb County Commission passed a resolution condemning " the gay lifestyle " and advanced an ordinance tying arts funding to " strong community , family-oriented values , " staff writer Kathey Alexander separately questioned two commissioners who clashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions and their answers : <p> Q : The domestic partnership debate in the city of Atlanta was cited as one reason for the resolution against " the gay lifestyle " in Cobb . How do you feel about the issue ? <p> Wysong : " It has been the practice in this country nationwide not to recognize unmarried couples as equivalent to married couples . I 'm not even sure that same sex , different sex is a part of that issue . I see it as a raid on the treasury whereby , for example , an employee could decide his unemployed son and his four children was his domestic partner and dependents . <p> Cooper : " I oppose it . But when that issue hits the county of Cobb , we 'll face it then . When it happens in Cobb , we 'll discuss it and vote it down then . There are boogeymen all over the world that may come to Cobb . You ca n't try to pre-empt everything . That 's totally specious . " <p> Q : Gays in the military and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasons behind the resolution . Should Cobb County respond to these national issues now ? <p> Wysong : " National defense is probably the No. 1 charge of the government in the constitution of the U.S. To use that mission to accomplish a social agenda is important to every individual , regardless of where they live . I think the outcry from the people from across this country said we do not want the military used for that purpose . Someone has to articulate it . It was an appropriate way for us to send a message from the citizens . " <p> Cooper : " I do n't think so . You respond when the issue confronts Cobb County . I do n't there 's any point making up an issue when it 's not an issue . There are a lot of issues in other counties and other places that have n't come to Cobb County . You confront those issues when they 're there . Gordon keeps invoking the name of Sen. Sam Nunn who opposed lifting the ban on gays in the military . From knowing Sen. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't believe he would have signed on to this resolution . " <p> Q : Do you think commissioners used their office as a " bully pulpit ? " Is the responsibility of commissioners to lead the county in moral or community standards decisions ? <p> Wysong : I do , in fact , think that 's not only an option , but it 's an obligation for us to confront the issues . I believe the public has a right to know my position . Using that office , to me , is communicating with the public . Is it a bully pulpit ? That 's not exactly flattering way to describe that function . I know he Cooper described it that way , but he does n't understand I 'm not campaigning . <p> Cooper : " I have no problem with the commission addressing community standards when it comes to using taxpayer money . But I feel , and I still feel , the resolution was inappropriate . It had nothing to do with taxpayers ' money . I have my personal view on that and a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's appropriate to use my goverment position to target one particular group for government chastisment . The other two commissioners totally agreed with me and Bill Byrne to pull the item from the agenda in July . But once they found it being on there , they felt forced to vote for it . " <p> Q : What is your relationship with Theatre in the Square ? Do you go ? How do you feel about its accomplishments ? <p> Wysong : I do n't have any mission for them to accomplish . It is not relevant to me on a personal level what they do . My interest is to carry out the trust that the taxpayer in seeing that their money is spent on things that they endorse and support . No I do n't go . It 's just not one of the things I make time to do . <p> Cooper : I think that they have basically good shows . There are some that have maybe been a little controversial . I 'm not a season ticketholder , but I probably get to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' I could see what might could be slightly objectionable to some people . I 've seen ' Smoke on the Mountain , ' it was excellent . I think the theater has been very positive to the community , both economically and culturally . <p> Q : How do you feel about homosexuals ? <p> Wysong : I do n't have any strong feelings one way or the other . <p> It 's never been an issue which I felt was significant in my relationship with another individual , very much like I do n't ask people other personal questions - because it 's none of my business . It 's when public funds are used to advance that lifestyle or to hold it up as a role model , I think it 's inappropriate . <p> Cooper : " I do n't think there 's any reason to single out any groups , homosexuals , Indians , Jews , WASPs - any group , period . I have my own very strong personal feelings about this group . But I do n't believe on the dais with the Board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 're my personal positions , and they will remain personal . " <p> Q : Do you think Cobb will be used by the religious right as an example of the proper government reaction to family values and gay rights ? <p> Wysong : " Yes , I think we will . I do n't have any particular problem with that . The fact that we happen to agree is almost coincidence . This cuts across all political lines . If you look at Sam Nunn who opposes lifting the ban on gays in the military , Billy McKinney who opposed domestic partnerships benefits in Atlanta ) and Gordon Wysong , you see Republicans , Democrats ; blacks , whites ; urban , suburban , rural ; conservative , moderate , liberal . This is certainly not the agenda of one party or one group . <p> Cooper : Sure we will . Obviously , I do n't like it , and I do n't think it 's appropriate because I do n't think we should have signed the resolution . . . I have strong religious convictions , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Part of the things Jesus Christ teaches us are tolerance and understanding and trying to help people , even if we disagree with them .
