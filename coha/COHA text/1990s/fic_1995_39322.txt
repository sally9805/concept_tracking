In those days in our house we each got a dime for the Fourth of July : a nickel for ice cream and a nickel for the afternoon movie on Concord Street : Tom Mix in one feature and Hoot Gibson in the other . Louie would have his dime in his back pocket because there was n't room for anything more in the front pocket . Joey , the baby , would have ten pennies in his handkerchief in his fist because he liked money . I , Danny , the eldest , would have mine in my stash pocket as I walked between them , holding a hand of each , because that was orders from pa . We were the three Lombardi kids from Colorado Street whose ma sewed for money and whose pa worked in the Great Northern yards , walking back and forth every day to save trolley fare . <p> In those days everything was orders in our house . It was orders to go to the movies to celebrate the Fourth of July . It was orders to come straight home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street before coming to the house with the high black fence where Harry Connery 's mother lived . They said he had something to do with moonshine . They said he was bad . When he came to visit his mother , the men from Colorado Street would stand on the corner and guess how much his long touring car cost . <p> For me it was also orders to keep clear of the bluff where the other guys were shooting off the Minnesota Salutes : three- and five-inch firecrackers as big around as a penny . They were against the law to sell in the city limits , so the guys bought them up on Dodd Road in Dakota County . <p> Everything was an order from pa , who called us into the living room that one night before the Fourth , the evening paper spread on the couch and the citizenship certificates , his and ma 's , hanging on the wall above his head in the double frame she had bought on Robert Street . <p> He sat like a kid  --  I can see him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear the money in his fist as he smiled at us . <p> " Dan , how you feel , eh ? " he asked , as though we had n't been eating supper together in the kitchen half an hour ago . <p> " I feel fine , pa , " I said , because you had to do it this way , like he had done for his pa in Sicily . <p> Pa said , " Louie , everything O.K. with you ? " <p> " Sure , pa , " Louie said , and I had the idea then . As I heard the coins , I thought of it . My heart caught so that for an instant it hurt when I breathed . <p> I watched pa , who said , " Hey , you , Joey , " as I stood there feeling all the danger of what I was going to say before I even knew if I was going to say it . I waited , biting my lip for guts as pa pulled Joey forward , bending to kiss the uncombed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he asked . Joey nodded , waiting patiently for his due . <p> " All right , " pa said . " So . Tomorrow is Fourth of July . Larry Ho says please make safe-and-sane holiday . Newspaper says all should be careful . " <p> Larry Ho was the nickname of our mayor , whom pa had never seen , but never called anything else because he had voted for the man . <p> " Movies is safe and sane , " pa said . " Movies , and for each ice cream and , later , when night comes , sparklers . " <p> Sparklers again ! <p> Sitting on the front-porch steps below ma and pa , as I had last year , watching the sparklers he had stuck in the ground , waiting for them to burn out , so I could go up to the corner where the guys were . I almost said it then , because I had said it three times to myself , but only stood quiet as pa counted pennies aloud , dropping each one into Joey 's cupped hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Louie , " and handed over a dime . <p> " Thanks , " Louie said , as pa looked up at me . He smiled at me and I saw the dime in his hand . <p> He said , " Danny , " and I could n't hold it back . <p> " No , " I said , instead of the speech I had repeated to myself three times . <p> " Take your dime , " pa said . He had n't even heard me . " For movies tomorrow . " <p> " No , " I said . He heard me that time . <p> " I do n't want  --  " <p> " Take , mister , " pa said . <p> " I do n't want a dime , " I announced , stepping back from the couch . " I do n't want to go to the movies , " I said . " I do n't want to watch sparklers . I want a quarter . " <p> " A quarter ? " he repeated , moving on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the stockinged feet touching the floor . " Why a quarter ? " he asked . " You tell me , please , " he said . <p> " Why a quarter ? " <p> I could feel my fingernails all the way into my palms , but I said it . " Minnesota Salutes , " I said . " I want to buy two packs like the rest of the  --  " <p> "  --  guys in block , " pa finished for me . " And if they smoke , mister ? Then will you smoke ? And if they will hitch a ride to a truck to go  --  " <p> " Peter , " ma said , but he did n't even look up at her . <p> "  --  downtown and be bums on the streets ? " <p> " I 'm no bum , " I said . I was in it now , I guess , talking to him as I had never talked to him before . " I do n't smoke , " I continued . " You know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he reached out on the couch for the newspaper . <p> " You heard Larry Ho of this safe-and-sane holiday , " he declared . " You know of this terrible burn and explosion from big firecrackers , eh ? You know I like if you take Louie and Joey to the movies ? " <p> " How about what I like ? " I asked . <p> " Daniel , " ma said . <p> I turned my head , but she said no with her lips . <p> " Here , you , " pa said . He was holding the dime out . I turned to ma again , but she said no again without saying anything , and then I did n't care . <p> I grabbed the dime and threw with all my might , and then I ran . I banged the swinging door into the kitchen so that it slammed the sink , and the dishes in the dryer rattled , but I kept going , down the back steps , over our yard , through Morgan 's yard and Dwyer 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and slowed down a little . <p> Robert Street was a shopping street . A shopping street was trouble where pa was concerned , so it was against orders . He did n't want his kids there . I was never going back home , so I did n't care . Five minutes later I was on it , with all the lights in the world burning at once , and enough people to fill the ball park just walking along . <p> I walked with them , my hands in my pockets and wondering where I would sleep . I wondered where I would eat and what kind of a job I should look for . I wondered if pa and ma would go to the cops . There was a cop on the corner ahead of me . Behind him , leaning against the windows of a fruit-and-vegetable store , I saw Sid Glotter and Gutless Wonder , whose real name was Tommy Richards . I turned quick , taking big steps to the curb . I was waiting for the traffic light to change when I heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Get home before I tell your old man . " <p> I walked back slow , wanting to see Sid 's nose splattered over his face , my hands loose at my sides and the fingers curled just a little . <p> " Tell him , " I said . <p> Sid sneered at me . " Does he know you 're out , baby boy ? " <p> " Yeh , " Gutless put in , " ai n't mamma gon na spank when mamma gets you home ? " <p> I was n't afraid of him . I looked right at him . " What 's it to you , Gutless ? " I asked . " What business is it of yours ? " <p> Sid put his hand on my arm . " Take it easy , Dan , " he said . <p> I pushed his hand off me . " Just mind your business , " I said . I was mad and I was afraid . I had seen Sid give it to Joe Grabowski , and Joe was bigger too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would never let me forget it . <p> " Beat it , " Gutless said . " G on , beat it . " <p> " When I 'm ready , " I said . By busting in , Gutless had stopped anything happening between Sid and me . I could get away now , but I had to wait a minute , so it would n't look like they were chasing me . I opened my belt and pulled it tight , looking down to get it right , taking as much time as a pitcher . <p> " I 'll see you guys , " I said , and felt Sid 's hand on my arm again . <p> " Where you headed for , Dan ? " he said . <p> " To get some Minnesota Salutes , " I told him . I moved his hand off me , turning away from them , my hands in my pockets lifting my pants high off my shoes , swearing at myself for saying what I did . I do n't know why I said it . Tomorrow they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bum of the street . <p> I crossed with the light , walking with my head down . I 'd never been so alone in my life . I guess I 'd never really felt hopeless . I would just have to keep going and hitch a ride on a truck . I headed out toward the Flats , where Robert Street ended and the highway began . I was down hear the license-plate factory when they caught up with me . They ran around in front of me , walking backward . <p> " There ai n't no Salutes out here , " Sid said . " There 's nothing but potato farms out here . You ai n't got money , Dan . " <p> " I 'll get it , " I said . " I ' 11 get it . " Why had I stopped to talk with them in the first place ? <p> " Where ? " Sid asked . <p> " Do n't worry . " <p> " Where ? " <p> " Do n't worry ! " <p> That 's when Sid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that  --  putting his hands against my chest and pushing . " I know where , " he said . He was pushing backward , not hard , but the way a friend pushes . Now I was walking backward while they were going forward until we were all in the dark , against the wall of the license-plate factory . " Do you want to know where ? " Sid asked . <p> " Maybe , " I said . <p> He put his face right up to mine . " Harry Connery 's mother is where , " he said , and I shivered . <p> I felt it cold all across my back . I felt it hurt in my chest . " You 're crazy , " I whispered . <p> " Unh-uh , " he said . He shook his head real slow . " I 'm smart , Dan . " <p> " Yeh , " Tommy said , giggling . He was nervous . I could tell he was nervous . " Yeh , Sid 's smart , " Gutless said . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He looked at me again . " There 's a tree in the alley behind Harry Connery 's house , " he whispered . " We go up the tree , swing out over the fence , drop down into the yard . We got three empty bags here . We fill them full of tomatoes out of old lady Connery 's garden . We take them up on Robert Street to the fruit-and-vegetable store . We get a quarter a box . We send Gutless Wonder up on Dodd Road . He comes back with two packs each of Minnesota Salutes . " <p> " You 're crazy , " I said . " What about Harry Connery ? " <p> " He 's not there , " Sid assured me . <p> " How do you know there 's tomatoes ? " I asked . <p> " Quit stalling , " Sid said . " I need somebody to  --  " <p> " I got to be home , " I said . <p> "  --  come into the yard with me . Gutless Wonder will stand watch outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wonder . What are you , Dan , another one ? " <p> " I got to be  --  " <p> " Gutless , " Sid said , and took his hands from my chest . " I knew it . " He started walking toward the lighted end of Robert Street . I ran ahead of him and turned . I said , " I never stole before . Nothing . " <p> " This ai n't stealing , for Pete 's sake , " he said . " Old lady Connery all alone . Nutty as a hoot owl . What 's she going to do with all those tomatoes ? " <p> It was pa 's fault . One stinking quarter ! He could have done that . He did n't have to order my whole life ! <p> " O.K. , " I said . I put my hands in my pockets , lifting my pants high above my shoes . " Come on . " <p> " Yeh , that 's the stuff , " Gutless said . He started to come up beside me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pushed Gutless . " Behind us , " he said . " You ca n't walk with the men . " <p> That was all he or any of us said until we were in the alley behind the block old lady Connery lived in . There he whispered , " Give me the bags , Gutless . " He got the bags . " We 'll fill ' em together , Dan . We 'll stack ' em against the tree . I 'll go up . You hand ' em to me . I 'll go over with ' em , one at a time . Gutless will run ' em up here . " He pointed at the grassy slope behind Eli Watkins ' house . " When you hand me the third bag , follow me out . O.K. ? " <p> I wanted to say no , but I nodded . I was in it , nodding at Sid Glotter , whom I did n't even like . Whom I was afraid of , really . <p> I can never remember all of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't remember coming down into the garden . I can remember the ground smell still , and on a clear summer night , wherever I am , I can still see the tomato vines in the moonlight , yet I ca n't remember picking the tomatoes . I ca n't remember filling the bags , or carrying the bags , or handing the bags up to Sid , but I remember the tree groaning with his weight . I remember Sid leaning forward for the third bag , and will I ever forget the terrifying moment when the branch broke ? <p> Will I ever forget the feeling <p> of desperate doom falling upon us as Sid dropped to the ground and the bag slipped out of my hands ? Will I ever forget  --  can I forget  --  the panic as the light blazed suddenly in the house and we heard her hobbling across the bare floor of the sleeping porch upstairs ? <p> " Sid ? " I said . I could n't find him . I tried to whisper . " Sid , are you all right ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and come on , " he whispered . " Come on , " he whispered , reaching for a branch , swinging with his legs free like a man on a trapeze . <p> For a crazy second I was paralyzed until another light flashed on in the house , and a third . I jumped and grabbed and was kicked in the ribs as Sid struggled upward . I saw the lights going on in the house and twisted like a monkey from side to side , moving up , up , up until I was even with the fence , reaching , holding , climbing higher than the fence and then pushing away from the tree with all my might , falling over and down . <p> Over the fence with palms out into the dry , rocky , hard-as-cement alley , feeling the rocks cut , feeling my pants rip at the knees , feeling my ribs hurt , crawling forward as I moved , even while I tried to straighten up , like a sprinter after the starting gun sounds . <p> I passed Sid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't pass Gutless , who was waiting for us when we got to the grass behind Eli Watkins ' house . <p> " Get the two bags , " Sid said , but he was through bossing me . He took one . I got Gutless Wonder by the shoulder , shoving him so he almost fell . <p> " Go on , " I said . I was shaking . I was sick from what had happened . " Go on , Gutless . Running Gutless . Worrying about yourself . Go on , take- <p> " Watch yourself , Dan , " Sid said . <p> " And you , " I said , turning to him . " Thief , " I called him . " What are you going to do , thief ? I 'm a thief , so what do you think you 'll do ? Come on , then , " I said . " Come on , " as Gutless backed off , cradling his bag of tomatoes . <p> " I 'll see you later , " Sid warned me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you want it , or tomorrow , or whenever you think you 're big enough . " I was ready . I did n't care if he beat me up . I just wanted to be clean of him . He made me sick , and what I had done made me more sick . <p> " O.K. , " Sid said . He was hurrying off , carrying the tomatoes . " O.K. , Dan , I 'll remember . " <p> I watched them go . Then I turned toward home . <p> Do n't you see ? It was like I wanted a licking . I wanted pa to beat me up . It would be kind of payment for what I did . <p> He did n't even say hello . He looked at me over the rim of the glass of soda water he was drinking , sitting across the kitchen table from ma . I got one look before he went back to the newspaper . <p> " Good morning , " ma said . I saw it was five minutes to ten . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my bedroom . <p> Ma dropped her sewing . " Dan ! " she cried . I had forgotten my hands . My hands , my knees , the ripped pants , and the ribs she could n't see . <p> " Daniel Lombardi , you hurt ! " <p> " No , I 'm not , ma . " I was looking at him , but he kept reading the newspaper . <p> " Hitched a ride by a truck , " ma decided , " and fell . " <p> I wanted to tell him then . I wanted him to share it with me , I guess , and take some of the sickness away , but as ma grabbed me my knees hurt so much I almost cried out . <p> " Look , Peter ; from truck , " she said . <p> " I did n't fall off no truck , ma , " I said . " We were scaling the fire-barn wall . I fell off . " <p> " Peter , look here on Dan , " ma said . <p> He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He put the newspaper under his arm . He looked at me . Looked through me . Then he walked out . <p> " Come on , come on , " ma said , pulling me to the sink . <p> " I 'm no baby , " I said . " I can wash myself . " He had never done anything like that : just walked out when one of us was hurt . While I was washing and ma was bandaging , I waited for him to come into the kitchen . All I heard was the turning of the newspaper pages . When I was finished , when ma had poured me milk and given me three cookies , I said , " Pa never did that . " " What ? " She was busy with the needle once more . <p> " Paid no attention if someone was hurt . " <p> " Pa hurts , too , Dan . " <p> " What are you talking about ? " I demanded . <p> " Hurts here , " she said , pressing her heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to the movies ? " I asked . " Is that so wrong ? " <p> " Wrong for pa , " she said . " Dan , you do n't know hows pa feel about Fourth of July ? Pa feels like go to church on Fourth of July . Pa feels this is the most important day , Independence Day . " <p> I got up , leaving the milk and cookies . I ran into the living room , stopping in front of him . I moved the papers with my hand so he could see me , and I said , " I 'm sorry , pa . " <p> " M'm'm'm 'm , " he said . <p> " I did n't mean it . " <p> " M'm'm'm'm 'm . " <p> " Pa , please . " <p> " All right , mister . Now maybe I finish this newspaper . " <p> I almost ripped the paper . I almost kicked it like you would punt a football . I wanted to do something , anything , to get rid of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk back into the kitchen to dunk my cookies . <p> " What 's the matter with him ? " I asked ma . <p> " He hurts , " ma announced again . <p> " I hurt , too , " I said . " Have n't I got feelings ? " <p> Ma smiled , shaking her head . " Someday you be a papa , Danny . Someday you have a oldest son . Oldest son can hurt like nothing can hurt . " <p> " Is that a reason to  --  " <p> " Listen , you , " ma said . She was n't sewing now . " Finish milk and go to bedroom . " <p> On my way to bed I went into the living room for a book I did n't want . After I was in my pajamas , I came back and got another book I did n't want , but he did n't even look up . I waited about five minutes and went back . <p> " Can I have the funnies ? " I asked . Pa went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When he gave me the funnies , I said , " Thanks . " <p> " M'm'm'm 'm , " he said . I went to sleep with that . That 's what my pa gave me for good night . Long afterward , when the lights were out in the house , when I could hear the floor boards creaking and I seemed all alone in the world , I got to sleep by telling myself he would make up in the morning . He would grab my neck , cup my neck in his hand like he always had done , pulling me forward to knock my head against his head so lightly it was like a leaf falling to the ground . <p> I was wrong . I could n't have been wronger . Pa was gone . <p> He came in while I was finishing my toast . He carried a bag under his arm . I said , " Hi , pa . Is it hot out ? " but he only turned to ma . <p> " Where are the boys ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " I ca n't tell , " she said . " My nurse is off today . " <p> Pa went through the kitchen as she shook her head . " Sicilians , " ma said . " Stay ' way from him , Danny . " <p> " Yes , " I said . " I can do it now , " I said . <p> I slid out from behind the kitchen table . I got my cap from the peg as I went out into the sun . I guess I was just tired of begging . Of begging , of being kicked around , of being brushed off . I went down Colorado Street to the playgrounds to shag flies for an hour . Afterward I watched a scrub game between two teams of older guys . Then Herman Simon wanted to see some planes take off , so we walked to the airport . The sun was almost straight over us , so we sat alongside the hangar in the shade for a while . Coming back , we cut across the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I left Herman there to walk to the top of the Ohio Street hill , which looked down on half of the city . That 's where Louie found me  --  sitting on the ground and leaning against a tree . <p> " Dan ? " <p> " What ? " <p> " Can I sit with you ? " he asked , sitting with me . <p> " The movies were terrible , " Louie said . <p> " You would have hated them , Dan . " <p> " O.K. " <p> " Do you want my ice-cream nickel ? " he asked . <p> " No , " I said . " Thanks . " <p> " You can have it . " <p> " No ! " <p> " Dan , " Louie said , " I 'm supposed to bring you home for supper . Ma said to find you .

" Please , Dan . " <p> " I 'm not hungry ! Ca n't you understand English ? " I asked , and saw he was going to cry . I got to my feet , brushing my pants . " Come on , I 'll walk with you , but I 'm not going home . " <p> We came down the hill without talking . We went past the playground so we could come into Colorado Street from the near side . I said , " I 'm going down to the bluff . " <p> " Please , Dan , " Louie said . He took my hand . " I 'm supposed to bring you home . " <p> " No , " I said . Pa would n't even look at me . " No , I 'm not hungry . " I shook myself free , walking toward the bluff . <p> He walked beside me , half running to keep up with me . I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got there , Gutless Wonder was touching a long piece of smoking punk to a firecracker Sid Glotter held . As the wick smoldered , Sid lunged forward . Gutless Wonder said , " Sid , do n't ! " There was real fear in his voice as he jumped away . Sid saw me and said , " Here , Dan , " motioning with the Salute . Louie jumped . Eli Watkins , on the other side of me , jumped while I stood there . <p> " Guts , " said Sid , throwing it over the bluff . " You got guts , ai n't you , Dan ? " <p> " Enough for you . " <p> He took a Salute from a pack . " Here , " he said . <p> Louie tugged at my sleeve . I pushed him away as Sid came forward . " Take it , " Sid insisted , holding the firecracker in front of him . " Let 's be divvies . Partners .

He was taller than anybody I had ever seen . He was wearing brown-and-white shoes , and my chest hurt . I wanted a drink of water as he said , " How are you , Sid ? " talking to me . <p> I knew then . His mother had heard me calling Sid in the darkness in the garden last night . <p> " I 'm not Sid , " I said , while Louie started to run . Louie , who could n't look at anyone who was in trouble . I was alone now , all right . All of them around me had spread out , stepping back or to either side until there were only Harry Connery and me . <p> " You 're not , eh ? What do they call you , kid ? " <p> " I 'm Dan . Dan Lombardi . " My whole back was wet . I could feel my shirt sticking to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His legs were as big around as lampposts . <p> " Who 's Sid ? " Harry Connery asked me . He reached down to take my arm in his hand . He held my arm until it began to hurt . He said , " Come on , kid , which one ? If he is n't here , where does he live ? What 's his last name ? I 'm telling you , kid , do n't make me  --  " <p> " That 's him ! " <p> Harry Connery released me and I turned to see Gutless Wonder . He was already over the side of the bluff , pointing at Sid . <p> " There he is , mister , " said Gutless Wonder . " That 's the guy , Sid Glotter , " and he disappeared . <p> Harry Connery moved , but Sid was too fast . He leaped like a broad jumper going after Gutless Wonder , and as Harry Connery stood with his back to me , I said , " Me too .

He had turned and come ahead and grabbed me , holding my shirt with one hand , slapping me with the other . <p> " Lousy little punk , " he said , holding me . My face hurt so I could hardly see . " No-good , thieving punk , " he said , hitting me again , on the same side again . I had to bite my lips or I would have cried . I would have just screamed , it hurt so .

His bedroom slipper fell off . <p> I was crying then , all right . I could n't stand it to see him on the ground . He was on his back , and he turned and pushed himself .
