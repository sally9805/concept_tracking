... Today 's Archival Treasures <p> In January 1840 , some five months after Louis J. M. Daguerre 's invention was announced to the world , the Franco-Belgian ship L'Orientale anchored off Rio de Janeiro . Among the passengers who came ashore was Father Louis Compte , a French priest who had brought with him a daguerreotype camera . He amazed an assembly at the Hotel Pharoux by making daguerreotypes on silver surfaces sensitized to light with iodine and developed by exposure to mercury . Although each picture was one-of-akind , because no negative was produced , the clarity and detail of the image were remarkable . Rio 's Jornal do Comercio marveled at Father Compte 's demonstration : <p> It is necessary to have seen this thing with one 's own eyes to appreciate the rapidity and the result of the operation . In less than nine minutes , the fountain of Largo do Paco , the Praca do Peixe , the monastery of Sao Bento , and all the other surrounding objects were reproduced with such fidelity , precision , and detail that it was readily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand of nature , almost without the intervention of the artist . <p> Unknown to Father Compte , fellow Frenchman Hercules Florence  --  one of the originators of photography  --  was living in Brazil at the time . Since the early 1830s , he had been experimenting with image-reproduction processes as possible replacements for lithography . Florence coined the word photographie to describe his inventions , but he did n't commercialize or even announce them until after Father Compte 's well-publicized demonstrations in Rio . <p> Like most immigrants to South America , photography first took root in the coastal cities of Rio de Janeiro , Montevideo , Buenos Aires , Valparaiso , and Lima . Several years elapsed before an intrepid photographer strapped the bulky tools of his trade to a mule and made his way to Bolivia 's Andean steppes . By the 1860s , however , after the daguerreotype had been supplanted by various photographic processes using glass plates , from which paper copies could be made , photography was flourishing in that country . <p> Lamentably little is known of Bolivia 's photographic pioneers . The Enciclopedia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a voluminous study of the country 's cultural history , offering titles on medicinal plants , folklore , poetry , explorations , music , and the cinema  --  but nothing on still pictures . Interest in this overlooked aspect of Bolivia 's cultural heritage has begun to emerge : Paceno historian Gaston Dick O. has published a series of special magazines , La Paz de Ayer y Hoy La Paz of Yesterday and Today and Potosi de Ayer y Hoy Potosi of Yesterday and Today , illustrating the cities ' stories with historical and modern photographs ; the municipality of La Paz , in conjunction with an exhibition at the Museo Tambo Quirquincho , last year issued La Paz , Sus Rostros en el Tiempo La Paz , Her Faces in Time , a near half-century stroll ( 1898-1940 ) through the capital 's streets and plazas as viewed through the camera lenses of the Cordero family  --  Julio Cordero Castillo and his sons , Julio Cordero Ordonez and Gregorio Cordero ; and antique dealer and collector Javier Nunez de Arco recently organized an exhibition at the Museo Nacional de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a German immigrant and self-styled archaeologist who devoted his life to the study and promotion of the Tiwanaku ruins , located a few miles south of Lake Titicaca . ( Posnansky 's photographic images were more accurate than his archaeological views : He asserted that Tiwanaku was the birthplace of all prehistoric civilizations of the Americas . ) <p> Despite these recent efforts , the story of Bolivian photography , especially in its formative years , remains to be told . Erika Billeter 's mammoth survey , Fotografie Lateinamerika , published in Switzerland over a decade ago , contains not a single Bolivian image . Vicente Gesualdo 's Historia de la Fotografia en America , Desde Alaska hasta Tierra del Fuego en el Siglo XIX A History of Photography in America in the Nineteenth Century , from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego , published in Argentina in 1990 , devotes but a few paragraphs to the topic . According to Gesualdo , an Argentine cultural historian , the first photographers to visit Bolivia were New Jersey brothers Charles and Jacob Ward , who toured Peru , Chile , and Bolivia between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equipment on muleback , " up to the Bolivian highlands from the Pacific coast , and " took many pictures in La Paz , Oruro , and Chuquisaca Sucre . " The Wards ultimately returned to the United States , and the whereabouts of their daguerreotypes are unknown . <p> Gesualdo identifies Mariano Pablo Rosquellas ( 1790-1859 ) as Bolivia 's first amateur photographer . Rosquellas , a Sucre violinist and singer , purchased a daguerreotype camera in 1849 from the French photographer Amadeo Gras , who had settled in Uruguay . The first professional photographer of Bolivian birth appears to have been Francisco Solano Ortega ( 1810-97 ) , although whether he ever took photographs in his homeland is uncertain . Ortega , who had studios in the Argentine cities of Salta and Rosario , learned the trade in 1856 from an English photographer , William G. Helsby . With his brothers , Thomas and John , Helsby operated a series of studios in Buenos Aires , Montevideo , Valparaiso , and Santiago ( as well as one in his native Liverpool ) between the mid-1840s and the mid-1850s . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throughout Bolivia  --  not only in cities like La Paz and Sucre , but also in small provincial capitals like Totora and Tarata . Studios opened , closed , and merged frequently . Although the photographers , most of whom appear to be Bolivian , can be identified from their imprints , biographical details are hard to come by . Nineteenth-century photographers who came to Bolivia from other countries tend to be better known today , however , because more photographic research and collecting has taken place in , for example , Chile , Argentina , and the United States . <p> It seems somehow appropriate , then , that the history of a visual medium be reconstructed from what is left to see  --  the photographs themselves  --  which are scattered in family collections , museums , and libraries throughout Bolivia , the United States , and Europe . <p> During the latter half of the nineteenth century a visual calling card , or carte de visite , became a worldwide fad . A small portrait photo mounted on a card two-and-a-half by four inches , the carte de visite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1854 and remained popular until the end of the century . The image was taken with a special camera that made eight negatives from one exposure , which facilitated the reproduction of many copies . Often bearing the photographer 's imprint , this inexpensive , stiffly backed photo was passed out among family members and acquaintances and collected in leatherbound albums . Cartes de visite of politicians , clerics , royalty , entertainers , and military heroes were sold as commonly and cheaply as postcards today . An album that once belonged to Cochabamba 's Delgadillo family contains forty-one cartes de visite , many with personal messages inscribed on the back : Represented are seventeen clerics , mainly Franciscan monks ; three military figures , including Luciano Willka , a charismatic indigenous leader who rallied altiplano Indian forces against President Mariano Melgarejo during the revolution of 1870-71 ; and twenty or so Delgadillo family members and friends . <p> The cabinet card , so called because it was propped up on a cabinet shelf , was an offshoot of the carte de visite , and also frequently bore the photographer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing subject , the photograph measured about three-and-a-half by five-and-a-half inches and was mounted on a stiff card of four-and-a-third by six-and-ahalf inches . Even in small towns , studios followed certain photographic customs dictated by technological requirements , such as the relatively long exposure time , and by portrait styles fashionable in Europe , the source of most equipment and supplies . In a typical portrait , the subject would be dressed in formal attire and seated with his or her elbow resting on a small table or Greek-style column . In order to further preclude movement during the several-second exposure time , the subject 's head would be steadied on an apparatus known as the " third leg , " a headrest mounted on a tripod , the base of which can sometimes be seen near the subject 's feet . An Oriental rug might be in the foreground , and a painted cloth depicting a bucolic or classical scene would hang in the background . To suggest a rustic atmosphere , the Oriental rug might be replaced by bunches of straw . <p> Most commercially made photographs from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ printed on thin , fragile paper , usually treated with egg white ( hence the term albumen prints ) . One albumen-paper factory in Germany devoured thousands of eggs a day . The photograph was mounted on a grey , cream , blue , or pink card with the photographer 's name and sometimes a promotional phrase imprinted in gold below the portrait or on the back . The mounting card thus served multiple purposes : It secured the fragile print , obviated the need for a frame , and advertised the photographer 's name and services . <p> Stereographs  --  in which double , side-by-side pictures were viewed through a hand-held stereoscope to create a three-dimensional image  --  were also immensely popular . Few middle-class homes of the era were without a stereograph set , and stereoview companies sprang up to meet the demand . The larger firms maintained hundreds of thousands of views in their inventories and dispatched photographers all over the world to fill the demand for novel and exotic scenes . By the end of the century , however , the public 's fancies had shifted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technological advancements , photography moved outdoors and into the countryside . By the 1880s , although the formal portraits remained popular , cabinet cards began to feature picnics , village fiestas , mule trains , and mine camps . In 1888 , with the introduction of the Kodak box camera using roll film , the snapshot era dawned in Bolivia . Photographs began to look spontaneous ; the candid snapshot broadened the world of subjects and possibilities . Naturally , some of these early experiments were successful , and others not . <p> German geologists Alphons Stubel and Wilhelm Reiss gathered approximately two thousand photographs during their 1868-77 expedition to Colombia , Ecuador , Peru , Bolivia , Chile , and Argentina . The records from the decade-long expedition , deposited at Leipzig 's Museum of Ethnography in 1896 , were thought to have been destroyed during World War II bombing . The photographs , however , miraculously survived and were later rediscovered . Several Bolivian images were included in an exhibition of the Stubel Collection mounted in Berlin in 1988 by photohistorian Andreas Krase . <p> American entrepreneur George Earl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late 1870s while planning and promoting railroad ventures ( including the doomed Madeira and Mamore Railroad ) , bequeathed to Brown University in Rhode Island a small book called Views of Bolivia , which contained circa  --  1870 albumen prints . Forming a valuable record of the era , these prints , a few of which also appear in the Stubel Collection , are sometimes attributed to Church , although he was probably not the photographer . A pair of 1869 portraits of the " Celebrated Doctors of Caupolican , " are mesmerizing . Known as kallawaya , perhaps from kolla ( medicine ) and waya ( purse ) , the doctors were descended from a long line of shamans who had been walking the Andes from Ecuador to Argentina selling herbs and amulets since the Tiwanaku period ( around A.D. 1000 ) . Their home territory is a cluster of villages in the provinces of Munecas and Franz Tamayo ( previously Caupolican ) northeast of Lake Titicaca near the Peruvian border . Garcilaso de la Vega praised them as " grandes herbolarios . " Swiss-American anthropologist Adolph F. Bandelier , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , characterized them as a <p> curious guild of Indian medicine-men and shamans . . . who are great and intrepid peddlers ; they extend their journeyings to the eastern as well as the western seacoast , and one is as likely to meet a Callahuaya in Buenos Ayres as to find him offering his wares at La Paz , Copacavana , or on Titicaca Island . Their costume differs from that of the Aymara , in that they wear pantaloons and broad-brimmed hats . A poncho with more or less intricate patterns , and always dirty , falls down the neck as far as the knee , over the usually dilapidated breeches . Two big bags , like saddle bags , and a wallet with coca and other ingredients , handsomely woven , but stiff with grease , complete the official costume of the wandering Callahuaya . We met them everywhere . <p> It is a wonder these ambulant curanderos ever sat still for their portrait . <p> Potosi photographer Moises Valdez was just as itinerant , though in a different profession and a smaller neighborhood : He traveled through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photographs for Aramayo , Francke , a major mining enterprise . Valdez took portraits and group shots of mine officials as well as more informal photographs of mining operations and village scenes . Setting up his tripod in Quechisla , the company 's administrative headquarters , Valdez attracted a flock of curious laborers , who stood on hills in the background , but appear to be perched atop the straw roofs of the houses in the foreground . <p> French brothers Aquiles and Eugenio Courret , celebrated pioneers of Peruvian photography , ventured into Bolivia during an excursion to southern Peru to document Arequipa after the devastating earthquake of August 13 , 1868 . Among the dozens of albumen prints contained within their elaborate , two-volume album , Recuerdos del Peru Remembrances of Peru , are four Bolivian scenes . One is of La Paz 's Plaza Murillo , two are of the main square in Oruro , and the fourth is of the church in Calamarca . <p> In front of the Calamarca church are seven villagers , two of whom moved during the exposure . A pair of ghostlike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arcaded church grounds , anchored at one end by a solid , triple-tiered bell tower , look like a universe unto itself . <p> The Oruro and Calamarca prints are incorrectly identified in the Courrets ' album as La Paz scenes . Mislabeling of photographs was not uncommon because prints or presentation albums were often prepared by persons other than the photographers themselves . Indeed , the fact that Recuerdos del Peru is emblazoned with the brothers ' imprint does not guarantee that they were the actual photographers . Major studios like theirs employed technicians at every stage of the process  --  from taking the photographs to developing , printing , hand coloring , and mounting them . <p> A large collection of circa-1870 cartes de visite by Arequipa-based Ricardo Villaalba was recently rediscovered and sheds some light on the world of photographers of the period . Although their subject matter was obviously influenced by the limits of the technology and the class interests of their customers , the collection also shows their awareness of the artistic possibilities of their medium . Assembly-line portraits of middle- and upper-class patrons paid the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portraits , all in carte-de-visite format and many of them hand colored , of Indians  --  muleteers , weavers , shepherds , water carriers , house servants , messengers , foot soldiers , and field hands  --  who lived in La Paz and Oruro . Whether Villaalba expected to sell the cartes as curios or was pursuing some artistic vision is unclear . Whatever his motivation , this extraordinary collection , which immortalized a pantheon of nineteenth-century Bolivian serfdom , passed into the hands of American naturalist Elizabeth Agassiz , who eventually donated it to Harvard University 's Peabody Museum , where it now resides . <p> To look upon Villaalba 's cartes de visite today is to be transported back to the Bolivian streets of the 1870s . Yet as these visual clues fascinate , inviting the viewer to look deeper , the personalities of the first photographers themselves remain elusive , still hidden behind the camera and beneath the darkcloth. n <p> PHOTOS : Old photographs <p> PHOTO : An 1856 Helsby brothers image of Tiwanaku 's Gateway of the Sun . <p> PHOTO : Indigenous leader Luciano Willka @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throw of Bolivian president Mariano Melgarejo . <p> PHOTO : A bread-toting Pacena rode her pony through Peruvian photographer Ricardo Villaalba 's studio , about 1870 , perhaps on her way to the Alacitas Fair . <p> PHOTO : In the early 1870 's , Ricardo Villaalba captured some two hundred cart-de-vista portraits in La Paz and Oruro , including this infantryman and his family . <p> PHOTO : Old photograph . <p> PHOTO : Explorer and railroad promoter George Earl Church and three potential railroad customers . <p> PHOTO : These kallawaya , itinerant Bolivian herbalists sat for their portrait in 1869 . <p> PHOTO : Declared a national monument in 1943 , the church at Calamarca , south of La Paz , dates from the sixteenth center . <p> PHOTO : The Courret brothers took this stark portrait in 1868 . <p> PHOTO : The dawn of the snapshot era in the 1890s : The Ramirez family , picnics on a farm near Tupiza . <p> PHOTO : The Aramayo , Francke headquarters in Quechisla .
