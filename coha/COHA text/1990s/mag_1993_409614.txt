The voice on the phone was chillingly matter-of-fact . " I 've killed another man , " the caller told police . " Have n't you found him yet ? " After giving an address in a rundown neighborhood  --  where detectives would discover a nude corpse , strangled like the four victims before him  --  the man continued , " I will go on killing . You ca n't catch me . I 'll kill one a week . " The scene played like a sequel to Silence of the Lambs  --  but it was all too real . As Scotland Yard revealed during a dramatic press conference last month , there 's a serial killer stalking London 's gay community . Since early March , five men have been murdered in their homes throughout the city . During the same period , police received a number of calls from a man they believe to be the killer , based on the " accurate and intimate " details he volunteered about the slayings . The caller coolly explained how he picked up his victims in gay bars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sex sessions . Scotland Yard , which generally does n't disclose details of ongoing investigations , took the extraordinary step of going public just hours after the fifth body was found on June 15 . " We feel we owe this to the gay community , " explained Detective Chief Superintendent Ken John , who is coordinating the investigation . After warning gays of the danger of picking up strangers , John appealed to the murderer " to contact us again as a matter of urgency . " News of the killer  --  who was predictably compared to Jack the Ripper  --  sent shock waves through the city . Surprisingly , reaction seemed muted among the gay community , which was gearing up for the massive annual Lesbian and Gay Pride Parade on June 19 . In a response typical of patrons at gay clubs around town , Jonathan Lisseman , a 20-year-old student , said , " Gay people take a lot of risks anyway , and it just seems like another one to look out for . " A few gay Londoners even began jokingly referring to the strangler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gallows humor may stem from cynicism among gays about the British justice system . That distrust has worsened since a recent court ruling upheld prison terms for sadomasochistic acts between consenting adults . Or perhaps other threats put the deaths in perspective . " After living 10 years under the shadow of AIDS , " said Michael Mason , publisher of London 's Capital Gay newspaper , suddenly people are wondering if we 're quaking with fear because five people have been murdered , as terrible as that is . " From the start , the killer has shown a sense of macabre theatrics . His first known victim , Peter Walker , a 44-year-old director and choreographer , was discovered in the bedroom of his flat in Battersea , South London , on March 10 with a condom stretched over his head and two teddy bears nestled next to his body . The former dancer 's wrists bore rope burns , and he had been gagged with knotted condoms before being strangled . The gruesome crime had not yet been made public when a man called the Sun newspaper expressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported to have said , almost as an afterthought , " I tied him up and killed him .... It was my New Year 's resolution to murder a human being . " Walker , a native of Liverpool , had just been hired as assistant director of the West End musical City of Angels . Friends say he had appeared lonely in the weeks before the murder . Since he found out he was HIV positive , Walker 's closest companions seemed to be his white Alsatian , Sammy , and his black Labrador , Bessie . But last spring he started spending more time at gay bars like the Coleherne , a West London pub with a reputation for attracting a leather crowd , where police theorize he may have met his killer . " I think he was throwing caution to the wind , " said one of Walker 's friends . " He did n't want to go home to an empty flat . " Initially police did n't link Walker 's murder to the body discovered May 30 in the Victorian cottage with a flourishing garden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a serial killer , authorities assumed that Christopher Dunn , 37  --  by day a bespectacled , sober-suited librarian  --  had accidentally asphyxiated during the S &M; session suggested by the black-leather harness and studded belt his bound corpse was wearing . But then the mystery caller asked police why he had n't seen press reports of Dunn 's killing and advised them to look more closely at the body . When they did , they detected signs of strangulation . The third victim seemed something of a departure . For one thing , tall , blond and handsome Perry Bradley III , 35 , international sales director for adhesives manufacturer J-B Weld Co. , was an American . For another , he did n't lead an overtly gay life . In fact , friends back home in Sulphur Springs , Tex. , a close-knit community 80 miles east of Dallas , dismissed even the possibility . " He loved beautiful women , " says Wanda Lair , a hairstylist who had known Bradley since childhood . " I think he was in the wrong place at the wrong time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bradley 's death  --  his strangled body was found nude and bound on June 7 at his flat in fashionable South Kensington  --  leave them with " an open mind " about his sexual orientation . Financially comfortable even before his own successes in real estate and construction , " Little Perry "  --  son of the late Democratic Party fundraiser Perry Bradley Jr .  --  was legendary in Sulphur Springs for his generosity . He thought nothing of picking up the dinner tab for 22 friends  --  or shopping for just the right gifts for residents of a local nursing home . Says Gene Gordon , pastor of the Sulphur Springs Methodist church Bradley and his family attended : " The tragedy is that this is a person who made life so much better for so many people . " So did the killer 's fourth victim , Andrew Collier , 33 , the well-liked live-in caretaker at an East London apartment complex for the elderly . " We all knew he was " the other way , " but nobody minded that , " says one resident . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9 , Collier 's body was discovered in his apartment . Like the other victims , he had been strangled  --  as had his pet cat , Millie , whose corpse had been positioned next to his in an obscene tableau . After Collier 's death , the killer reportedly told police , " I am not giving myself up . But the clues are there . I have read the FBI manual on serial killers . I will be in touch about the fifth . " Days later he was . The victim  --  whom police had yet to find  --  was Emanuel Spiteri , 42 , a Maltese catering assistant . A short man who liked to wear leather pants and motorcycle boots , Spiteri frequented gay bars but generally , says the barmaid at one , was " the classic wallflower . " The night he died he visited the Coleherne . At the press conference following the discovery of Spiteri 's body , police declined to discuss their caller 's accent , perhaps for fear of copycats . As it turned out , communication from the suspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the killings . ) Scotland Yard initially received few tips from the gay community , despite handing out 10,000 leaflets appealing for help at the gay pride parade . Many gays were leery of coming forward , said a gay police officer , because they feared that " what they say about sadomasochistic activities could be used against them in the future . " However , calls picked up following Scotland Yard 's release on June 26 of its sketch of a man spotted with Spiteri the night of his death . Many claimed to have seen this prime suspect , who was described as white , age 30-40 , over 6 ' and full-faced with discolored teeth . The night of Spiteri 's murder , the suspect was casually dressed in jeans and a bomber jacket and carried a small purse . While the investigation continued , the press and public theorized about the murderer and his possible motives . One particularly popular hypothesis , bolstered by the fact that three victims  --  Walker , Dunn and Collier  --  were HIV positive , was that the killer might be taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guessed he might be a closet homosexual , or a power freak who enjoyed playing God with his victims . Robert K. Ressler , the now retired FBI agent who coined the term " serial killer " and who has written three books discussing serial homicides , says he 's seen the type before . Ressler suspects the London killer  --  who reportedly has said he is using one of the books to give him a jump on police procedure  --  is " a person who is trying to conquer their inadequacies by doing something important . Challenging the police  --  setting up scenarios where they 're the center of manhunts  --  communicating with the media , is just nothing more than attention-seeking at a very , very bizarre level . " Still , " profiles per se do not solve cases , " Ressler observes . What does , he says , is solid investigative work  --  and from what he sees , the outlook in London is good . " When you get five victims who are all more or less at this social level , somebody , somewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think this guy is going to get caught . " <p>
