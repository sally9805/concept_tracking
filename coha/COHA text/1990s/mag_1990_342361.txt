Kamori Kanko Co. is heading downhill  --  and happy about it . Early this month the Japanese tourism firm said it had agreed to buy Heavenly Valley , the ski resort near Lake Tahoe , for an estimated $90 million . The sale would mean that Kamori Kanko will play host to more U.S. skiers than any other company . The firm , controlled by Sapporo businessman Katsuo Kamori , 83 , and his son Kimihito , 47 , also owns the ski resort of Steamboat Springs , Colo. , which the Kamoris bought last year for a reported $110 million . The elder Kamori has not confined his interest to the slopes . Besides owning amusement parks and golf courses in Japan , he has converted an Australian farm to a wildlife sanctuary , earning him the nickname Mr. Koala.
