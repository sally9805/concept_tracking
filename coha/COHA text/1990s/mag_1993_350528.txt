Fifteen apparitions have I seen ; <P> The worst a coat upon a coat-hanger <P>  --  WILLIAM BUTLER YEATS <P> A similar conscience-stirring hallucination seized stockbrokers Larry Doyle and Terry Scott , management consultant Sheena Laughlin , computer scientist Parviz Kermani and record-company executive Bill Shaughnessy as they went through their closets . Hanging there were winter coats they had not worn in years . Doyle 's gray-and-black herringbone was of an elegant European design that he now considers a bit flashy . The vibrant blue of Laughlin 's five-year- old down coat had begun to fade . Kermani 's dark blue raincoat had become too tight . Shaughnessy thought the brown trench with the bright red lining was starting to look like Columbo 's . Scott had purchased a new , gold-colored overcoat to replace the sturdy dark gray mohair that sheltered him through years of commuting from Fairfield , Connecticut . <P> Conventional wisdom says New Yorkers are afflicted by compassion fatigue , the dispiriting belief that since nothing will solve the problems of the poor and homeless , nothing should even be attempted . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not extend to owners of winter coats during the Christmas season . Far better , these five and tens of thousands of others have concluded , for their unused garment to be on the back of some shivering soul . <P> The same vision came to Elizabeth Yanish Shwayder , a sculptor from Denver , 11 years ago . Visiting her daughter in Toronto , she learned of that city 's annual coat drive , which collects used winterwear and gives it to the needy . In 1982 , as Denver suffered through a horrific winter storm , Shwayder brought the concept home . Seven years later , the coat drive had become a Denver institution , and Shwayder decided to go national . Her first target was New York City . <P> Shwayder contacted Suzanne Davis , who worked for the J.M. Kaplan Fund . The foundation , in turn , enlisted the New York City police department and New York Cares , an innovative organization whose philosophy , according to executive director Kenneth Adams , is to create ways " for time-starved but civic-minded New Yorkers to take part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " This effort to combat compassion fatigue mainly involves scheduling activities like manning soup kitchens after regular business hours so that potential do-gooders can pitch in . But , Adams stresses , the key is for volunteers to feel they really make a difference in the lives of the downtrodden . The coat drive was ideal . It keeps its promise to give the coats to needy people in a matter of days . Donors can get a warm , cozy feeling inside by simply cleaning out their closets . <P> It worked even better than Shwayder hoped . In its first year the New York coat drive distributed 10,000 winter coats . This year the goal is 75,000 . The coats are collected in boxes at police precincts and bank branches , at more than 50 companies and at major commuter points like Grand Central station . There New York Cares has set up a display of coats from such celebrities as New York Knicks star Charles Smith ( a towering blue worsted ) and Mayor-elect Rudolph Giuliani ( a staid gray tweed ) to tweak the conscience of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the city to be given to those who need them . New York Cares says it costs less than $1 a coat .
