<p> IRVING - It was fun back then , just the way everyone told them it would be , even in the darkest days of 1-15 . All of it was new and different , and with each breakthrough success , the excitement only seemed to build . <p> Things are like that the first time around . <p> " " No one really expected us to do it , " Troy Aikman recalled one day last week . " " Even we did n't realize how good we were . <p> " " So we went into Candlestick that year , very much happy that we were in the Championship Game . And then to win it . . . " " <p> This was January 1993 , just three NFL playoff seasons ago . <p> Now , at the ripe old age of 29 , Troy Aikman surveys the NFL landscape and sees a ghost of sorts advancing on the horizon : Brett Favre and the Packers , coming to Texas Stadium for an NFC Championship Game . <p> Favre , at 26 , is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next great thing . His team is fresh from its own coming-of-age moment in San Francisco , hoping to make the fun last a little longer . <p> Sound familiar ? The irony is hardly lost on Aikman , cast in the peculiar role of the " " old man " of this showdown , still 10 months away from his 30th birthday . <p> He remembers how all of that felt - rolling into Candlestick , knocking off the favored 49ers , going on to win Super Bowl XXVII . As he stands in front of his locker at Valley Ranch on a midweek afternoon , there is just the trace of wistfulness in the voice as he talks about how it must be for Favre and the Packers these days . <p> " " I 've got to believe that he 's having just a wonderful time this year , that the whole team is , " Aikman said . " " From that standpoint , you wish every year was like that . " <p> " " What Brett 's going to find - what some already have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Things , indeed , have changed for Aikman and the Dallas Cowboys . The air began to leak from the silver-and-blue balloon as early as the weeks and months after that first , dizzying Super Bowl success . <p> " " The expectations change completely , and that 's fine , that 's very natural , " Aikman says . " " But with that , some of the enjoyment is lost . <p> " " Then you realize that you 're a pretty good team . You talk about going to the Super Bowl for the next eight months leading into the season . <p> " " That becomes very tiring . " <p> Other things change , too . <p> Free agency and salary-cap restrictions force old friends like Kevin Gogan and Mark Stepnoski to find employment elsewhere . <p> Norv Turner , the offensive coordinator who helped you develop into a Super Bowl MVP , moves on to coach the Redskins . Jimmy Johnson , the hard-driven coach who built the Cowboys from 1-15 to world champion in just four whirlwind seasons , vacates the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jones . <p> Coming up a game short of the Super Bowl last season does n't make things any more pleasant . Suddenly , there are questions about coaching , questions about players , hints that all concerned had grown fat and happy , that the current cast would never be able to climb the mountain again . <p> Could it really be just three years since that 30-20 win at Candlestick ? Even less since the 52-17 rout of Buffalo in Super Bowl XXVII ? <p> " " I said after winning the first Super Bowl that I did n't know if I 'd ever look at a regular-season game the same , " Aikman says . <p> " " It 's a long grind . " <p> Now , though , comes the fun part : the playoffs . A chance to climb the mountain again , even if it is n't ever quite so thrilling once you know the view from the top . <p> " " I really have fun once we get into the playoffs , " Aikman said . " " I enjoy everything the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if you win , you move on , and if you lose , you 're done . You do n't have any excuses . Everyone knows what 's on the line . " <p> So far , with everything on the line , Troy Kenneth Aikman has been pretty good . In nine postseason starts , he is 8-1 , losing only last year 's NFC Championship Game in San Francisco , a muddy , mistake-filled afternoon on which he still threw for 380 yards and two touchdowns in a doomed cause . <p> Already , he is a two-time Super Bowl winner , MVP in XXVII , his first try . Only Bart Starr , in fact , has a higher postseason quarterback rating than Aikman 's 103.8 <p> " " Troy 's an intense dude to begin with , but once the playoffs start , he really takes it to another level , " Cowboys wide receiver Michael Irvin said . <p> " " He knows how serious this is . It really seems to bring out the best in him . " Now , in his seventh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more determined than ever to savor the occasion . And if , indeed , 49 weeks of groundwork must be laid for these three weeks of fun , he clearly has earned the chance to enjoy himself this time around . <p> The hangover of that Championship Game loss carried all the way into training camp . After reporting in the best shape of his career , a calf muscle , of all things , went out in October . <p> A battered knee made him an early casualty in the Nov. 12 disaster against the 49ers . <p> The other calf has been bruised . His back - the one that required surgery in 1993 - still bothers him from time to time . <p> " " Other than that , " he jokes , " " it 's been a lot of fun . " <p> A private sort by nature , Aikman grew even more reclusive as a troubled season teetered on the brink . As his light regard for head coach Barry Switzer became more and more apparent , there even has been speculation that he might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , $ 50 million contract . <p> Asked the other day if Switzer is little more than a " " hood ornament , " Aikman laughed , but did not respond . Pressed further , he offered a tepid , " " No . . . Barry 's not a hood ornament . " So how goes it between quarterback and the coach who once recruited him to the University of Oklahoma ? <p> " " We 're both here to win football games , " Aikman says . " " Because <p> of that , we have a good relationship . <p> " " We do n't have a personal relationship , but that 's not unusual . " <p> So this has not exactly been a six-month thrill ride for anyone concerned . The other day , though , Aikman actually appeared to be enjoying himself , joking with the same reporters he has worked to avoid much of the year , clearly invigorated by the thought of playing in another Championship Game , perhaps even another Super Bowl . <p> There may not be many more chances , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think , well , you 'll be back , " he said . <p> " " Then you realize after a while just how hard it is to get there . <p> " " You ca n't take any of this for granted . You may never have another chance like this again . " Limiting those opportunities may be Aikman 's choice . Beyond any differences with Switzer , he talks of being an " " old " 29 , how the pounding of these seven seasons have taken a toll . He wonders how much longer the competitive fire will continue to burn . <p> " " There 's a side of me who 'd like to play until they have to carry me off the field , " he said . " " And then there 's a side that , at times , has had enough . " <p> Those sides have been at war for much of this up-and-down season . The conflict has yet to be resolved . <p> " " As long as I 'm enjoying myself , and as long as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team to be successful , then I 'll continue to play , " he said . " " If those two elements are n't there , I wo n't . " <p> Part of the downside , Aikman says , is the ever-escalating price of success . Fame is n't something an Oklahoma native who still favors the occasional pinch between cheek and gum wears particularly well , in contrast to some of his equally well-known Valley Ranch colleagues . <p> He is skeptical , for instance , of making new " " friends . " A bachelor , he worries about meeting women , fearing they may be more interested in his celebrity and money than they are in the man behind it all . It bothers him , those close to Aikman say , that he has yet to settle down and start a family . <p> " " There are some things I 'd like to be able to do , " he said . <p> " " I 'd like to go to the mall and shop and do some of the things that I have n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then there 's the other side of it , where I get to meet a lot of different people . <p> " " There 's a tradeoff . There 's good and bad in it . " <p> In this , a season he rates as his " " most difficult " to date , Aikman has struggled to focus on the good . Privately , he has fumed about Jones ' grandstanding deals with Nike , Pepsi , American Express and Deion Sanders , Inc. not to mention the growing perception of the Cowboys as a " " no-class " organization . The tepid response of a veteran team to the laid-back ways of Switzer has only added to the aggravation . <p> " " Troy is n't a guy who 's going to be around here just to pick up a check , " says fullback Daryl Johnston . " " If it gets to the point where this is n't fun anymore , he 'll be gone . " <p> Mention " " fun " in Aikman 's presence , however , and a rueful smile crosses his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Metroplex this season , to the point that candor is n't always the best course . <p> " " We get into this topic , and then I have to contend with ' Troy 's not having any fun , ' " he said . " " And I 'm so tired of that . <p> " " I am having fun . I enjoy playing the game . Guys here still enjoy playing . <p> " " It 's just a different kind of enjoyment now , not like it was back in ' 92 . " <p> The comparisons are inevitable . Both are big and strong . Each endured his lumps early on , only to survive and lead teams into championship games . <p> Barry Switzer likes what he sees in Brett Favre . <p> He likes what he has in Troy Aikman even more . <p> " " As far as the prototype of the pro quarterback , Aikman is that guy , " Switzer said . " " He 's 6-foot-4 . He stands tall . He does n't have happy feet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 'll stand there and deliver the football . " <p> In just his second year in the NFL , Switzer has developed an even greater appreciation for what it takes . <p> " " His concentration level has to be unique because he knows he 's fixing to get the heck knocked out of him within a fraction of a second , " he said . " " You 're not oblivious to the fact that a guy is closing on you as you 're delivering the ball . <p> " " He knows it 's coming , but he stands in there because of his mental and physical toughness . That 's the prototype of what you look for in a quarterback , not someone who runs or scrambles . " <p> Aikman has done all of that . He has the rings - and the bruises - to prove it . Just the same , he often is dismissed as the most expendable of the Cowboys ' offensive superstars , a product more of the " " system " than of his own talents . <p> Even Favre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ games , while the Packers lean heavily on their quarterback to make the difference . <p> " " The problem , " says Switzer , " " is that Troy makes it look so easy . He 's so darn good , people just sort of take it for granted . " <p> Against the Packers , in particular , Aikman has been nothing short of brilliant . In the Oct. 8 game at Texas Stadium , just seven days after straining a calf muscle that was expected to keep him out for two or three weeks , he completed 24 of 31 passes for 316 yards and two touchdowns . In two playoff starts against Green Bay the past two seasons , he had a combined 51 completions in 67 attempts for 639 yards and five touchdowns . <p> " " I do n't have an explanation for it , " he says of his success against today 's Championship Game opponent . " " I certainly hope it continues , though . " <p> That it has gone this way in the first place is almost as ironic as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1988 , the Packers won their final game of the season , leaving Dallas with the No. 1 pick in the ' 89 draft . <p> The Cowboys used it on a blond-haired , big-boned quarterback from UCLA . <p> " " That 's not something I think a lot about , " Aikman says . " " It worked out great for me here in Dallas , and it 's worked out for Brett in Green Bay . " <p> And yes , it might be nice to go back , to spend a moment or two in Favre 's shoes this afternoon , but . . . <p> " " I feel very fortunate to have won two Super Bowls and to be playing now in my fourth Championship Game , " Aikman said . " " I would n't give that up to go back to being the first time , no . " Instead , the " " old man " of this Championship Game hopes to hold the stage a little longer . Just three years ago , the possibilities seemed limitless . <p> Things change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity , " he said . <p> " " There 's no question that window is getting smaller . <p> " " How many years we have left , I 'm not sure . " <p> This much is certain : It 's January . Playoff time . And after a season of more downs than ups , America 's Quarterback is having fun again . <p> " " This is the good part , " Troy Aikman says with a smile . <p> " " I 've always liked playing in a big game .
