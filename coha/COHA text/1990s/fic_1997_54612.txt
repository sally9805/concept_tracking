Betty does n't know how much longer she can stall Mrs. Beatrice . For more than a month , the poor thing has tried to schedule an appointment . She phones and chats as if nothing is the matter , as if she has n't a care in the world , and Betty hopes that just this once she wo n't ask , but she always does . And then Betty has to tell Mrs. Beatrice how sorry she is , but right now she simply does n't have the time . <p> " I do n't know where it goes , " Betty says . " Time , I mean . " <p> " I do n't , either , " Mrs. Beatrice says . <p> " Oh , " says Betty . " Oh , I 'm so sorry " <p> " Do n't be . If you do n't have the time , you do n't have the time . " <p> " Well , that 's true . " <p> " I 'll just call hack next week . How 's that ? Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right ? " <p> " Of course , of course , " says Betty . She says , " Call back next week , " but Betty hopes she wo n't . The truth is , Betty has too much time . The house is empty . Her son is in college out west , and her daughter is backpacking with a gentleman across Italy or Ireland , Betty can never remember which for sure . When her husband offers to take early retirement so they can go traveling , Betty just worries more . Too often she 's heard of men who stop working , ca n't adjust , and die . She imagines being stranded at the Grand Canyon or Disney World with a corpse , and then she has to ask herself , Who needs to see new places ? <p> " You 're lucky , " her husband says , " to have so much time . " They are lying in bed . He is hugging her from behind , while Betty stares out the window . When she does n't answer , he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " I guess " she says . <p> " You always said you would n't mind if a few of your ladies went to a beauty shop instead . " <p> " No , you 're right . " <p> " And now you say you would n't mind if more of them came here . " <p> " No , I know " <p> He laughs in the dark . He kisses her hand . He brushes the hair back off her forehead and rubs her skin with a thumb until the furrows of worry fade . He says , " I do n't know why I married you " and then she laughs , too . <p> But even after he 's long asleep , Betty lies awake . The last time she saw Mrs. Beatrice must have been a year ago . She had a head of healthy hair then , shiny and obedient , hair that made Betty 's job easy , hair that could n't help but look pretty . What she has now is anybody 's guess . In the darkness of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Betty imagines reaching into the tangle on Mrs. Beatrice 's head and coming away with a clump . She 's heard about the treatments . She knows what they do . There are people , she thinks , there must be people whose job this is . <p> Betty squirms closer to her husband . Outside the bedroom window are the stars she 's begun to watch . She ca n't see the heavens change from night to night , but now she knows they do . She 's noticed the difference from week to week , and she ca n't believe how much they 've moved since last month , when she first found herself staring out the window at night instead of sleeping . Betty flushes hot with confusion . She never knew the heavens change . She shuts her eyes and forces herself to keep them shut , and she tells herself that in the morning she will call Mrs. Beatrice and schedule the appointment . Then she backs up until her husband 's chest hairs brush against her skin , and they bristle , but the rhythm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as one . <p> But Betty does n't call . If it were anyone but Mrs. Beatrice , she would welcome the appointment . More and more , Betty finds herself filling the days between customers in front of the mirror in the basement , testing a new style on herself , or a change in shade . Her favorite time is under the dryer . The roar makes her deaf , the dome makes her blind , the heat makes her numb . She imagines herself inside a cocoon . She might emerge as anything , she thinks , or maybe she wo n't emerge at all . But recently she 's been thinking instead about Mrs. Beatrice . She thinks how she could be using this time on Mrs. Beatrice 's appointment , and then the ammonia in the solution sickens her and she has to raise the dome before she suffocates . She sits in front of the mirror then , working her hair over , pulling it and pricking it and jabbing it and teasing it until it 's back the way it was , until it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It used to be she had so many customers she did n't have time to think . She could spend five mornings a week , most of Saturday , and any number of evenings on her ladies , abandoning the dishes in the sink or the dust rag in the bedroom at the sound of the doorbell . The new beauty shop in the neighborhood is only part of the problem . Some of her ladies have taken their business there , and others have moved , but most have simply grown less attentive to their appearance over the years , saving their visits to Betty for special occasions , a daughter 's wedding or a son 's graduation or , maybe , the morning they wake up and look in the mirror and realize how long it 's been since they treated themselves to a permanent . Still , Betty ca n't bring herself to retire . She knows her ladies depend on her . She knows they need her , even the ones who stray to the beauty salon but return to Betty without apology or explanation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ladies pretty the way Betty in her basement can make them pretty because Betty knows their hair : the exact mixture of tint to keep this one looking five years younger , the gray on that one nobody else ever sees , the little curl on the forehead that makes Mr. Beatrice hunger for his wife . <p> And she knows more than hair . There is something about being ugly that brings out the sadness in people , and Betty has seen them at their ugliest . She has seen them , each of her ladies , with conditioner caking in wrinkles , with sheep placenta streaking the makeup on their eyes and cheeks , with pink plastic rods sticking straight away from pink scalps . At precisely these moments , Betty always swivels the chair , guiding her ladies away from the mirror . But still they talk . And when they talk , they are beyond Betty 's grasp , past the point where any amount of scalp massage or tint magic will help . Betty works her fingers as fast as she can . Her ears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her head pounds so hard she barely hears the rumors of adultery , the confessions of coveting a neighbor 's house or husband , the fantasies of health and happiness for their own husbands , their children , themselves , each other , Betty . She closes her eyes to steady herself . But she must open her eyes to keep her fingers working , and so she does , and so they do , until they 're done . And when she has restored the ladies , when she has returned to them their beauty , she tells them to close their eyes . Then she swivels the chair back toward the mirror . In that moment , with their eyes shut , their faces free of makeup , their hair styled to perfection , their mouths and maybe their minds closed against all their ills  --  in that moment Betty always wonders whether they 'd be better off this way forever . Then they open their eyes , and they are , again , themselves . Betty turns her back and replaces the caps on the bottles and dips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might inspect themselves in private . But Betty looks , too . She wants to marvel with them at their resurrection . Their eyes uncloud . The color rises in their faces . Smiles crease their cheeks as they realize that they need never worry as long as they can call Betty . But then , their smiles waver . <p> " What I said , " they say , searching for Betty 's eyes in the mirror , " just now , what I was saying  --  " <p> " Pretty is as pretty does , " Betty says . Besides , she adds to herself , it 's only hair , and what is hair , anyway , except tissue that 's dead ? <p> When she 's made her way back upstairs , Betty is always grateful that she 's not one of the ladies . <p> What finally prompts her to schedule an appointment with Mrs. Beatrice is when several weeks pass without hearing from her . Betty thinks about consulting with a customer to make sure Mrs. Beatrice has n't taken a turn , but when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has none . Nothing . Nobody . This happens , and then it always passes , the calls coming in , the familiar names materializing on this page or that , the days and weeks beginning to assume a life of their own . Still , for now , her book is blank . Quickly , before she has a chance to change her mind , Betty phones Mrs. Beatrice to say she 's got good news , she can squeeze her in that evening . Then Betty goes alone to the basement . <p> Sitting in the chair before the mirror , she sees no reason why she should n't keep the appointment as brief as possible . She sets out the exact number and sizes of curling rods . She selects the brushes . She checks the bottles of solution and neutralizer . When she 's done , she stares at the digital clock on the wall . Its numbers fade and focus with an electronic flutter that Betty 's never noticed before . She goes back to the brushes . She picks out some stray strands of hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Watching the fuzz disappear into the darkness of the bag , it occurs to her that whatever is inside Mrs. Beatrice now , eating her alive , was probably there a year ago , during her last permanent . <p> Betty goes upstairs to the living room and starts to strip the plastic coverings from the furniture . Her husband lowers his road map and watches for a while . Finally he says , " Company ? " <p> " I have a customer . " <p> She squashes the sofa cover against her stomach . <p> " It 's Mrs. Beatrice , " she says . <p> " Oh " <p> He stands up and fumbles with the road map until it 's folded . He sets it on the end table with the other maps and the tourist brochures that have been arriving in the mail lately from all over the country . Then he removes the plastic from his chair . <p> " How is she handling things these days ? " he says , following Betty into the bedroom . Elbow . to elbow , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a shelf . " How 's she doing ? How is she looking ? " <p> " l do n't know . But the least we can do is make her feel at home . " <p> Her husband stays in the bedroom to put on a fresh shirt , and a tie . <p> Mrs. Beatrice arrives by car , even though she lives in the next block . Her husband waits for her to make it inside the front door before he drives away . <p> " I told him to pick me up in two hours , " Mrs. Beatrice says . <p> " There 's no rush , " says Betty . " You should have told him to come on in . " <p> " Why ? " <p> " Well , " says Betty , " coffee . And cake . " <p> They join Betty 's husband in the living room . They sit on the furniture , still good as new . <p> " It 's funny , " says Mrs. Beatrice , " but I do n't think I 've ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Did you redecorate ? " " Oh , " says Betty , " these old things . " <p> Mrs. Beatrice looks fine in this light . She 's smaller than Betty remembers her , in the face and in the waist . And her clothes hang loose . But she 's always been on the delicate side , and other than that , everything is just fine . Betty wonders what the worry was . <p> " I 'm so glad you could fit me into your schedule , " Mrs. Beatrice says . <p> Betty 's husband has been sitting with his hands between his knees , staring at his fingers . Now he looks up at his wife . <p> Betty says to him , " You told a funny joke yesterday . Why do n't you tell it for Mrs. Beatrice ? " <p> Her husband says , " I do n't remember making any jokes yesterday , " and he goes back to studying his hands . <p> After a moment , Mrs. Beatrice says , " Oh , I see you 're going away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment before realizing that she 's referring to the maps and brochures on the end table . Betty turns to her husband , who is himself looking at the pile of literature as if he 's never seen it before . <p> Betty says , " We 're thinking about it . It should be nice . It 's what we 've worked for , do n't you think ? " She keeps staring at her husband , but he 's gone back to examining his hands . " Would anybody care for some coffee ? " she says to Mrs. Beatrice . <p> " Maybe I did n't make myself clear on the phone , " says Mrs. Beatrice . " I 've been getting more forgetful lately . I should have said thai I wanted to make an appointment for my hair " <p> " Well , yes , " says Betty . " Of course . So we 'll skip the coffee , then . We can go right downstairs . " <p> Once they 're alone in the basement , Mrs. Beatrice suddenly says , " Betty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , no , of course not , no . " Betty slips into her pink smock . She pulls the belt tight , and the hem balloons away from her waist , like a little girl 's dress . She slaps at her sides to make them behave . <p> " Because if I do , " Mrs. Beatrice says , " that 's all right , I do n't mind , I can go to a beauty shop instead . " <p> " Oh , no , please sit down . " Betty stations herself next to the chair by the sink . " Please . " <p> " It 's just that you do know my hair so well " <p> " Of course I do " says Betty . " I understand . Please . You 're looking just lovely . Really you are . How are you ? " <p> Mrs. Beatrice winces as she lowers herself into the chair , and she winces again when she leans her head back . She cranes her neck all the way back , so that her head lolls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the collar on her smock . The hair is shorter than Betty remembers . That would be the treatment , she tells herself . Or , maybe , the new beauty salon . <p> " Now you did say a permanent , " Betty starts , then catches herr self . She 's never noticed before what a silly word it is , for something that 's not . It should be called something else , like temporary . <p> " Betty , would you mind if maybe I did n't talk too much ? Sometimes it 's difficult for me . The doctors say I should save my strength . " <p> " Of course , of course . " Betty takes the hose from the bottom of the basin and runs water over the hair . It is mostly gray now . She reaches for it . She takes her hand back . She has jerked her hand back , but Mrs. Beatrice does n't notice . Her eyes are closed . Betty tries again to touch the hair . Her fingers are tingling , her skin is rippling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In a while , she tells herself , this wo n't happen . In a while she 'll be able to touch Mrs. Beatrice and it wo n't bother her a bit . If she had to do this all the time , it would be just a job . <p> She touches the hair . It is thin . It is brittle . That would be the treatment , too . In some places , Betty sees patches of scalp . It , too , is gray . Much of her skin is gray . Up close , Betty sees where skin sags , below the ears , at the neck , under the eyes . Betty closes her own eyes to catch her breath . <p> " Just because I do n't talk does n't mean you ca n't , " says Mrs. Beatrice . <p> " Oh . Well , of course . What should I say ? " <p> " I do n't know . " Mrs. Beatrice laughs . " I do n't care . You do n't have to talk , Betty . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I do n't , usually . Usually I just listen . But I can talk . Sure . " <p> " So tell me . You sound so busy lately . That 's good , is n't it ? " <p> " Oh , yes , " says Betty . " It makes the time pass . " She asks Mrs. Beatrice to sit up so that she can set the rods . " It 's not just that it makes the time pass , of course . I mean , nobody really wants time to pass . But you know how it is . You go and go , and you never seem to be able to do half the things you want to do , and you keep saying you ca n't wait for the day you can actually have a moment to catch your breath . And then one day , you wake up , and you 've got all the time in the world . Your children are raised . " Betty has set the first curl before she knows it , then moved on to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? They 're off at school , or falling in love in Italy or somewhere . They have their own lives ahead of them , which is fine and all , but where does that leave us ? Oh , we can travel . We talk about traveling . We talk about taking an early retirement and going off I do n't even know where . Just off , I suppose . It does n't matter , does it ? I mean , I 've seen pictures of the Grand Canyon , I do n't need to go there to know I 've never been there . One place is just like the next , only the rocks are piled different . My mother used to say that , and she should know , she was from the old country . I remember the teacher telling us once in school about how people used to travel by the stars , and that always made sense to me until now , because do you know what I 've noticed lately ? Lately , I do n't know why , but lately I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in bed . When I 'm in bed and I ca n't sleep . I look out the window sometimes , and I 've noticed that the stars move . Oh , not just when the earth turns , I do n't mean that . I mean from night to night , the same time , you look at it , and you 'll see , the stars wo n't be in quite the same place , l never knew that before . Does everybody know that ? I always thought they stayed still up there . Otherwise how could people travel by them ? It just does n't add up to me . Do you know anything about this ? What do you think ? " <p> She looks down . Somehow she has set all the curls . She pulls her hands away , to herself , and turns them over and back and over again . <p> " Oh , " Betty says , " do n't pay any attention to me . " <p> " Well , I really should n't talk much . But I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Without another word , Betty squirts solution all over Mrs. Beatrice 's hair , places a cap over her head , and sets her under the dryer . Almost at once Mrs. Beatrice is dozing . <p> It is then that Betty sees the toll the evening is taking on Mrs. Beatrice . Her head is puny inside the dome . Her face is white , her sockets shadows . The smock swallows everything else . All that shows from beneath it are her arms and legs , four sticks with skin . <p> Betty retreats up the stairs . She finds her husband at the kitchen table , hunched over a road map . He 's tracing a line across it with a red marker . Over his shoulder she sees hundreds of little circles that must be cities , a thousand pinpoints , and the thick red line that connects the dots . She has no idea what state this might be . Betty goes into the bedroom , sits on their bed , and wonders why she had to go and tell Mrs. Beatrice that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's happening ? " her husband says . He 's standing in the bedroom doorway . He starts to reach for the light switch on the wall . <p> " Do n't . " He drops his hand to his side . " Nothing 's happening . " <p> " Downstairs ? " <p> " She 's there . " Betty is silent for a moment . Her husband waits . A breeze from the open window at her back sends a shudder along her spine . " She 's frail . You could have said something to her . She 's very frail . It 's so terrible , really . I can see her get tired right before my eyes . You could have acted like she was there . " <p> " It gives me the creeps , " he says , " for you . " <p> " Someone has to do it . " She shrugs . " It 's the least I could do for her " <p> The shadow in the doorway nods its head . <p> " You going to be late ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rubs her arms up and down , hugging herself . " Do n't worry , " and she brushes past her husband , " if you do n't want to see her leave , just hide in the bedroom . " <p> In the basement , Betty watches Mrs. Beatrice until she wakens . <p> " I must have dozed , " Mrs. Beatrice says . She stretches the hem of the smock to cover herself . " Have you been watching me ? " <p> " No " says Betty , pointing a finger toward the ceiling , " no . " She is trying to make sense above the drone of the dryer . Mrs. Beatrice nods , nods , nearly drops off . Betty considers letting her sleep several more minutes . Maybe she needs it , she tells herself . Maybe I need it . But she shuts off the dryer and helps Mrs. Beatrice to her feet . Soon , Betty reminds herself , this evening will be over . <p> She guides Mrs. Beatrice by the elbow to the sink , where she rinses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has to hold on to the back of the chair as she eases herself down to the hard cushion . Once she 's settled herself , Betty swivels the chair slightly , and Mrs. Beatrice gazes away from the mirror . <p> Mrs. Beatrice , really , has hardly enough hair for Betty to work with . The layer of skin that separates her skull from the rest of the world is so thin in spots that Betty can see the white right through it . She can count the ridges . She can feel bone . <p> " This has been a difficult evening for you , " Mrs. Beatrice says . <p> " You do n't have to talk . " <p> I want to talk . " <p> " Do n't talk . " You are ugly now , Betty thinks , but soon you will be pretty . " I mean , should n't you be saving your strength ? " <p> " I napped . Really , I want to talk . I want to tell you how much this evening has meant to me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time , people not looking at you . " <p> Betty takes a rod in her hand and gently unfurls it . She rolls it away from Mrs. Beatrice 's scalp . This first curl  --  this creation of beauty that Betty has fashioned with her own fingers from a tangle of dead tissues  --  unravels , springs once , and stays . Betty stifles a sigh and moves on to the next rod . <p> " All the time " Mrs. Beatrice continues , " people not talking to you . I know what the experts say , that it 's not me people are afraid of . It 's themselves . I know all that . But it does n't do you any good to know it when every time you step out of the house , you 're treated like something that 's not human . It 's not the pain . I can live with the pain . And it 's not death . I can live with that , too . I 've made my peace . What it is , is the people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In a million ways . It 's them . They 're the ones who ca n't live with the pain . They 're the ones who have n't made their peace . They 're the ones who make my life a hell . " <p> " I 'm sorry " Betty has stopped unrolling the rods . She is staring into a tiny bald spot . " I 'm so sorry , " <p> " Why should you be sorry ? " <p> " For tonight . " <p> " Do n't be silly . You 've been wonderful . " <p> " You do n't know . " <p> " Yes I do . I do know . That 's what I wanted to say . I know how difficult this must be for you , and you 've been wonderful . You fit me into your schedule . " <p> Betty does n't know what to say . She says , " Close your eyes . " <p> But she sees in the mirror that Mrs. Beatrice already has them closed . In silence , Betty sets to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she gets to the final curl , Betty lowers it over the forehead , just the way Mrs. Beatrice would want to be remembered by her husband . Then Betty swivels Mrs. Beatrice toward the mirror . Betty steadies the chair , removes the smock , and waits . <p> Slowly Mrs. Beatrice opens her eyes . If they show anything , Betty ca n't see it . They are filmy . Betty figures that Mrs. Beatrice is simply studying her work , so Betty does the same . <p> She has done , she supposes , the best job she could . But for what ? Tomorrow , next week , a year from now , what will it matter ? Whatever it is that Mrs. Beatrice is , under the hair that 's gray and thin , inside this skin that 's already leaving her , will be gone . Betty has done the best job she could , and she has done nothing . <p> " You remembered " Mrs. Beatrice finally says . She is caressing the curl over her forehead . " You remembered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else , or to struggle from the chair , but Mrs. Beatrice does n't move . She just sits there , staring into the mirror . When Betty looks up at the mirror , into Mrs. Beatrice 's eyes , they are meeting her own . <p> " Do you think I 'm pretty ? " Mrs. Beatrice says . <p> Pretty , Betty wants to tell her , pretty ? Pretty is n't important . Pretty does n't matter . Pretty does n't count . <p> " Pretty is as pretty does , " Betty finally says , but she is too late . Mrs. Beatrice has turned away . The color has left her cheeks . <p> " Thank you " she says , anyway , glancing up at the digital clock . " My husband should be here any minute now . Thank you for the permanent , Betty . Thank you for your time . " <p> Betty stays awhile in the basement , alone , combing strands of gray hair from the brushes she 's used tonight . Then she dips the brushes into the disinfectant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then she dips the rods . When she 's done , she collects the hair and the brushes and the comb and the rods inside the garbage pail and twists the seal on the bag and carries it outside to the alley and dumps it all in a trash can . <p> In the backyard , she pauses and watches as the light in the bedroom window winks out . When she goes inside , she knows the house will be dark and empty , and she knows she will not be able to sleep . She turns in the direction that the bedroom window faces and searches until she finds her section of the heavens . She wonders if her son or daughter can see those same stars from where they are . She wonders if her children ever look at the night sky and ask the same question about her . She wonders if Mrs. Beatrice , one block away , is staring at this same square of stars . Then she goes inside . <p> Still in her smock , Betty climbs into bed and says , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " I tried " her husband says . <p> " She told me she 's made her peace . " <p> " I did my best . " <p> The lights are out . The house is empty . The only surprise is a crinkle from the closet , where the plastic covers are slowly unfolding . <p> " I know , " she says . " It 's not you . " Her husband pulls her close . " She told me I 'm wonderful . " <p> How does she do it ? Betty ca n't believe what Mrs. Beatrice told her is true . Surely she has her moments of doubt . Surely she 's not as peaceful as she seems . She must be lying awake now , Betty thinks . She must be staring out her bedroom window , maybe not at these same stars , but at her own section of the heavens . Betty imagines Mrs. Beatrice straining for sleep , aching for it , actually hurting with the need , in the shoulders and the neck and the eyes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep . But then she realizes that Mrs. Beatrice must already be asleep . No matter how worried she is , she must be even more exhausted . But how can she sleep ? But how can she not sleep ? And why does she waken ? How does Mrs. Beatrice do it ? <p> Betty 's husband is whispering something into the back of her neck . He 's saying that Mrs. Beatrice is right , that Betty really is wonderful , but she does n't answer . Betty is saving her strength . <p> <p> By RICHARD PANEK <p>
