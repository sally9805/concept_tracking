Developing a digital immune system in bits and bytes <p> The fear of new , dangerous viruses sweeping through an unprotected population is not limited to public health officials . Computer researchers have long worried because typical virus-scanning computer programs-which essentially vaccinate machines against known viruses-become outdated as newly created viruses spread over the Internet . <p> Just as researchers turned to biology in applying the name virus to the pesky programs that could make computers sick , several groups have turned to biology for a new model of how to protect computers against unknown viruses . They are focusing on the human immune system . <p> These computer scientists hope to develop a digital system that , like the immune system , can quickly recognize and fight off known infections , identify new intruders and learn how to deter them , and remember all previously encountered pathogens . Such a system also needs to be safe , reliable , and secure . <p> A computer virus released in March aptly demonstrated the need for more-effective ways of fighting off computer viruses . Although warnings about the Melissa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread as quickly as the alarms ( SN : 5/8/99 , p. 303 ) . Within just a few days , the virus had circled the globe , sending countless unwanted E-mail messages across the Internet and clogging E-mail service at hundreds of organizations , forcing them to shut off their Internet connections . <p> Although Melissa-the first virus to mail itself around the world-merely clogged E-mail systems , virus makers have already launched spin-offs of the virus designed to destroy data . <p> The risk of computer infections rises as more information is exchanged through E-mail or over the Internet . Likewise , the potential damage that viruses can create multiplies as people send sensitive personal and corporate data over the Internet . Computer security experts also warn that the avenues for viruses to spread multiply dramatically as computers use software that 's integrated so that one program can launch another . <p> " There used to be plenty of time to analyze a virus before it spread , but Internet-borne viruses can spread around the world in hours or days , " says Steve R. White of IBM 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " In a world where things can travel this quickly and do this much damage , we have to have automated ways of dealing with them . It is silly to think that we can protect against these viruses manually . " <p> Computer viruses got their name from what White calls " an obvious but deep biological analogy . " Like biological viruses , the computer versions replicate by attaching themselves to a host ( a computer program rather than a human cell ) and then co-opting the host 's resources to make copies of themselves . Infection can lead to death : The computer crashes and all program information is irretrievably lost . Infection can also lead to sickness when the virus does not destroy any data but spreads and slows programs and communications . Even seemingly innocuous viruses may taint files and make the computer more likely to crash-like a long-lasting , low-grade infection . <p> Companies spend several hundred million dollars annually on antivirus products and services , and they lose even more in downtime when they need to take their systems off-line to prevent viral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identify the viruses they already know , they are n't effective against the 10 to 15 new viruses created every day . Worst of all , says White , " many users of antivirus software blissfully continue to use antivirus software that is more than a year out of date . " <p> Aside from frequent updates , there are few ways of strengthening this system . Some antivirus programs can monitor a computer system for viruslike behavior , such as making a file bigger without adding new data , but such systems are prone to false alarms and virus makers can take steps to evade such detection systems . <p> In the early 1990s , White and his colleagues at IBM dreamed of a digital immune system for computers ( SN : 7/23/94 , p. 63 ) . For a model , they looked to the human immune system , which is constantly bombarded by infectious agents it has never before encountered and yet to which it generally responds quickly . <p> Computer virus makers often reuse key parts of existing viruses in their new creations , White explains . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viruses by these short so-called genes , which often are critical to the viruses ' function . Although conventional software might contain some of these genelike sequences , the presence of many is typically a sign of viral infection , White says . <p> When a computer participating in a pilot test of this digital immune system finds virus genes or any other signs of infection , it strips out confidential data and encrypts the rest . The altered file then goes to a central computer facility at IBM to be analyzed . A computer there routes the virus to a test machine that lures the virus into replicating by running a variety of programs . If any of these decoy programs become infected , the test computer attempts to pull out a signature that can identify the virus in other computers . <p> The signature and a prescription to strip the virus out of infected files is then sent back to the central computer . It adds the new virus to its database and sends the information on detection and treatment back to the infected computer . IBM 's automated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virus signature and derive a prescription , the developers claim . <p> Uninfected computers will also be " vaccinated , " as the IBM team puts it , against infections with this new virus as soon as they check the updated database . Ultimately , White envisions , uninfected computers will be vaccinated automatically . <p> Later this summer , IBM , in conjunction with a leading antivirus-program developer , Symantec Corp . in Cupertino , Calif. , plans to release an antivirus plan that includes such a digital immune system . " This is the first step toward a comprehensive system that can spread a global cure for a virus faster than the virus itself can spread , " White says . <p> The IBM researchers are still trying to develop ways to mimic another trait of the immune system . An infected cell produces chemicals signaling distress , warning neighbor cells to put up barriers to slow the spread of the virus . Thus , when the immune system develops ways of attacking the intruder , it can quickly outpace the spread of the virus . <p> The biological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's vision , says Stephanie Forrest of the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque . The human immune system identifies foreign invaders because they do n't carry the body 's typical flags of " self , " not because they resemble other infectious agents . Forrest and her colleagues have found a way for a computer to identify self . <p> By looking at short sequences of signals between a program and the computer 's operating system , she and her colleagues have defined patterns unique to each machine . Abnormal patterns may be a sign of infection . For example , a program making unusual demands on system resources has very likely been co-opted by a virus or is being attacked by a hacker , says Forrest . <p> " We 've shown pretty convincingly that looking at these short sequences of self gives good discrimination between what is self and what is n't , " she says . Such a system can be very efficient , Forrest points out . The protected computer uses its resources to check only programs and files that it is using . <p> She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into and out of a network of computers hooked to the Internet show patterns recognizable as self or nonself . <p> Like white blood cells in the human body , a digital immune system can create antibodies that recognize foreign material , Forrest says . To minimize the chances that the antivirus program will attack the computer itself , it would always destroy antibodies that flag patterns that are intrinsic to the computer . Using the remaining digital antibodies , the system will periodically check for abnormal patterns that may signify virus infections or intrusions from hackers . <p> Forrest and her colleagues are working on a system that will allow a computer to continually learn to redefine itself , so the computer can accept new programs without flagging them as viruses . The researchers have not yet explored how to attack viruses once identified . <p> Forrest says that a self-recognizing system will be practical even for individual computers connected to the Internet and used primarily for E-mail , writing , designing graphic presentations , and perhaps a little programming . <p> Though still theoretical , Forrest 's approach may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on every computer . Since every computer would create different antibodies , a virus that evaded one computer might not escape detection by another , limiting the spread of the virus . Likewise , a person who broke into one computer network and managed to avoid detection by that system might not be so successful on another network , she says . <p> " They 've taken a much more exact analogy with biology by developing digital antibodies , " says White . " But the analogy breaks down . All of my cells come from me , so my immune system can define self . But I put files on my computer every day . . . . This system may be very good for intrusion detection , but it may not be a good approach for viruses , because it will make too many mistakes . Our approach is more specific for viruses . " <p> Both research groups caution that in nature , no defense system remains perfect forever . Just as white blood cells and viruses engage in a delicate dance , each evolving to outwit the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ White says . <p> Viruses are getting more dangerous all the time , he says . Several programs for automating the development of macro viruses are circulating , meaning that the virus-writing community can create viruses faster than ever . <p> There are even some indications that viruses may be evolving on their own , White says . For example , some versions of Microsoft Word may make minor errors when copying viruses . These changes may disable the virus , or they may make the virus harder to spot . Also , if two or more viruses successfully infect a computer , one may accidentally copy itself into the other virus , creating a new kind of bug , he says . While uncommon so far , these scenarios are certainly threatening , White notes . <p> Whatever the form of the threat , the goal of protecting computer systems remains . " What we would ideally like is for a computer to behave the way the human body does , " says Sushil Jajodia of George Mason University in Fairfax , Va . " When we are attacked by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system detects the virus , defeats it , and heals the damage . Computer systems are not like the human body , though , in that we need to provide the technology . " <p> Because programs and operating systems are not usually designed with security in mind , antiviral programs will always be behind the curve , says Jajodia . " It still is n't clear how well this idea of digital immune systems will work , but we have no better alternative for detecting virus infections , " he says . <p> Computer users have demanded ease of use but not security , says Forrest . " While people are becoming aware of the issues . . . they do n't feel personally threatened yet . " She notes that " when the Internet took off in the early ' 90s , it became evident that the computer-security problem was going to become everybody 's problem . " <p> Jajodia , editor-in-chief of the Journal of Computer Security , says that programmers should address the problem of viruses long before people begin using newly developed software . <p> Designing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important first step , he says . More programs should check digital signatures to confirm that transferred files and computer code come from a trusted source . Better encryption systems , which help ensure that information has not been altered in transit from one computer to another , would make it harder for people to design viruses and for viruses to spread , he says . <p> Computer-security experts warn that no single set of changes will be enough to completely protect increasingly interconnected computer systems . They hope , however , that new security measures , such as digital immune systems , will fend off future epidemics . <p> By DAMARIS CHRISTENSEN <p> Computer viruses : Then and now <p> The first computer virus , called Brain , appeared in 1987 . The people who created the first viruses hitched them to operating systems ( such as DOS ) or to applications ( such as games or editing programs ) . Some of these viruses are still circulating . With these viruses , when a user turns on an infected computer or runs an infected program , the viral code @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any subsequent applications the user runs . These viruses spread only when a computer user shares tainted files and programs with other people . <p> On the other hand , viruses like Melissa latch onto macros , small programs hidden in word processing software . For example , when an unsuspecting recipient of the Melissa virus opened an infected document written in Microsoft Word , the virus activated and hijacked another program known as Microsoft Outlook . This program E-mailed copies of the infected document to the first 50 people listed in the program 's address directory . The virus spread so quickly because so many people use both Word and Outlook . <p> Until macros became commonplace , viruses could n't infect data files , including word processing documents and spreadsheets . Macro viruses proliferate rapidly because many people share data files freely , and they do so primarily through E-mail . Once one data file is infected , a virus can infect all other data files of that application as soon as they are opened . <p> By the end of 1998 , programmers and users had identified more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ millions of computers every year . <p> DIAGRAM : A digital immune system : A virus triggers the infected computer ( yellow ) to forward a sample of the viral code to an administrative machine , which in turn sends an encrypted sample ( riVsu ) to a central testing facility . There , a test machine lures the virus into replicating . Once the virus is confirmed , other components of the immune system produce prescriptions for identifying and removing the bug . This information then travels back to the administrative machine , which forwards the prescription to the infected computer and then to other computers on the local network . Eventually , the immune system designers envision sending automatic antivirus updates to computers worldwide . <p> By Damaris Christensen <p>
