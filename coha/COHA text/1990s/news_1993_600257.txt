<p> Brand loyalty is n't dead . But to some brand-name consumer-product marketers and the Wall Street types who closely follow them , brand loyalty is looking mighty sickly . <p> For years , brand-name marketers such as Philip Morris and Procter &; Gamble routinely could boost prices on consumer products ranging from cigarettes to pet foods . Consumers would grumble , but what could they do ? Their choices were limited due to a lack of high-quality , low-priced alternatives . <p> But escalating prices on brand-name goods , the recession and the explosive growth of cheap but increasingly high quality private-label products are turning millions of brand-loyal consumers into value-oriented , price-conscious shoppers . " More and more , consumers are saying they do n't need to buy a brand name , " says Judith Langer of consumer-behavior tracker Langer Associates . " Some brands do matter to consumers for products such as deodorants , coffee or detergent . But consumers are only semiloyal to many brand-name products . They look for bargains and low prices . " <p> Once consumers got a taste of products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovered that the performance , quality and packaging was comparable , many stuck with them . And they began to switch to other budget-priced goods . As a result , brand names no longer carry the cachet they once did . So the massive marketing and advertising spent on establishing and building brand equity - the added value a name or symbol gives a product beyond its functional purpose - is n't as effective as it used to be . <p> " Brand equity is always in trouble during recessions , " says food and tobacco stock analyst Ronald Morrow of Smith Barney , Harris Upham . " It was different this time around because grocery-store chains have been merchandising their private-label brands , making them act much more like brand names . " <p> Eroding consumer loyalty makes almost all brand-name marketers vulnerable to slower revenue and earnings growth as they try to keep consumers with heavier advertising , discounts and promotions . Tobacco , beer and food giant Philip Morris said Friday that its plans to counter surging sales of private-label and generic cigarettes by discounting Marlboros 40 cents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more a pack . The company says promotions , discounting and other marketing efforts to bolster Marlboro could crimp 1993 earnings of its U.S. tobacco operations 40% , or $ 2 billion . <p> Investors who used to count on Philip Morris and other brand-name consumer-marketing stocks for steady earnings growth have been bailing out since Friday . Sellers have erased $ 14.3 billion of Philip Morris ' market value since Friday , $ 2.3 billion from Procter &; Gamble and $ 938 million from Colgate-Palmolive . <p> " Philip Morris is still fresh in investors ' minds , " says PaineWebber Securities analyst Manny Goldman . " Time is a great healer , but one week may not be quite enough . " <p> Even if their stocks recover , brand-name marketers will continue feeling pressure from private-label makers and retailers as they improve the quality of their private-label products . Wal-Mart , the USA 's biggest retailer , will boost its private-label presence when it launches Great Value , a premium private-label line , to complement its basic Sam 's Choice private label . <p> Earlier this year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of foods and beverages . Safeway Select soft drinks already have doubled the market share Safeway got from Cragmont , the private-label soft drinks Select replaced , says Safeway merchandising chief Gary Smith . <p> Tobacco marketers Philip Morris and RJR Reynolds have contributed to their own problems by marketing private-label and generic smokes such as Basics . Many food and household-product makers who have famous brands of their own also do a sizeable business packaging goods for retailers ' private labels . <p> " That has helped retailers create store brands on par with national brands , " says Brian Sharoff , director of Private Label Manufacturers Association . So " in the last three to five years , thousands of store brands have been created that allow the consumer to cherry-pick products based on price in all sorts of categories . " <p> The move away from brand names has been happening in all kinds of businesses . Through most of the 1980s , personal-computer makers IBM , Apple and Compaq had the $ 40 billion-annual market to themselves . By the early ' 90s , hundreds of low-cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building no-name PC clones priced 50% below the $ 4,000 computers marketed by the industry 's Big Three . That turned PCs into a high-volume , low-profit commodity business that forced IBM , Compaq and Apple to cut prices and lower costs , sometimes by laying off thousands of workers . <p> Strategists doubt the impact on marketers of brand-name household and consumer products will be as severe . But their profits are bound to be squeezed . <p> Wheat First Securities stock analyst Jack Maxwell says that despite Philip Morris ' extensive promotional plans to discount Marlboro and the expected discounting expected from rivals such as RJR Reynolds , he still expects private-label and generic cigarettes to capture 40% of the U.S. cigarette market by year 's end . Moreover , marketing experts contend that short-term promotions often can backfire . " So many brand marketers are shortsighted and unrealistic in terms of what they can do for their brand , " says Managing Brand Equity author David Aaker . " Quick-fix promotions are n't going to work . What they need to do is get their prices in line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can go overboard with promotions - with disastrous consequences . Maytag 's promotional effort to boost 1992 appliance sales in Britain and Ireland backfired when its offer of free airline tickets to appliance buyers lured 200,000 consumers . Maytag will take a $ 30 million first-quarter charge to cover the additional promotional costs . A better strategy may be the one Procter &; Gamble began to phase in two years ago . The company started an everyday-low-pricing strategy for most of its brands two years ago - doing away with many promotions in an attempt to keep prices on many of its brands consistent . P &G's; Ivory , Dawn and Joy liquid dishwashing detergents now cost consumers about 14% less than before the strategy shift , says spokeswoman Ann Jenemann Smith . <p> Experts also say marketers need to spend more time focusing on a particular product instead of trying to parlay an existing brand into other products or lines . " Part of brands ' decline has been this mindless line extension , " says marketing consultant Al Reis of Trout &; Reis . " To be successful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't count brand-name marketers out . As brand-name marketers retool , reformulate marketing strategies and pricing , they 'll rebuild some of their lost brand loyalty . <p> In fact , some stock analysts say smart investors should think about buying stocks of name-brand marketers now that other investors are panicking . " It 's monumental stupidity to think companies with brand names like Coke , Pepsi or Kellogg are in jeopardy , " says Maxwell . " I think this is a beautiful buying opportunity in the food and beverage stocks . " Says Prudential Securities stock analyst John McMillin : " There have been pet-food wars , bread wars , baby-food wars , even cheese wars . We 're hardly in the first inning of value shopping . I would n't play taps for brand names right now . " <p> Contributing : John Schneidawind
