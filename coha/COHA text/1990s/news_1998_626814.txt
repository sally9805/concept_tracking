<p> These fields have been in Charles Novak 's family for three generations - land haunted by memories powerful enough to pull him from bed before dawn , only to drag him back after dark , dirty and dog tired . <p> How can he look at it now without pain ? <p> Stunted stalks of grain sorghum , pastures too brittle to feed his cattle , topsoil turned to dust : the elements of despair . <p> Like the two years before it , 1998 will end badly in farm country , another blow to a way of life that historically defined Texas in the same way that oil and real estate and fast-paced urban living do today . <p> If nature once lavishly blessed the state with fertile farms and lush grazing land , it appears to be having second thoughts . <p> This year it is drought , a siege of fiendishly hot and dry weather that is expected to cost Texas farmers and ranchers $ 1.5 billion and slash $ 4.6 billion from the state economy over the next 18 months . <p> Last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in many places . Another drought suffocated the state in 1996 , and hail wiped out Novak 's crops in 1995 . <p> Yet here he is , preparing for another planting season , as he has every year since graduating from high school 24 years ago . <p> A triumph of hope over reason . <p> Only twice during a drought is rain unwelcome : planting time and harvest . <p> So when Novak began harvesting his lackluster grain sorghum crop in mid-July - he got maybe 1,000 pounds per acre , less than one-third of what he reaps in a good year - it seemed a safe bet that nature would work in his favor , allowing him at least a dry harvest . No significant amount of rain had fallen on his Atascosa County farm since March ; rainfall in the county was as much as 70 percent below normal for the year . <p> He had n't even seen a cloud since July 4 . <p> But clouds began hovering on the horizon about halfway through the harvest , forcing Novak to worry just a little . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . If nature has dealt farmers a drought , do n't let man make things worse at harvest time . <p> Atascosa and six surrounding South Texas counties last year began a cloud-seeding program to ease water problems in an area with little industry other than farming and ranching . Proponents say the cloud seeding could help replenish the Carrizo-Wilcox Aquifer , which provides water for the region , and possibly increase rainfall during crucial growing seasons . <p> Just before Novak 's harvest was complete , a torrential rainfall lashed across the fields , knocking down half of what remained unharvested . <p> The cloud-seeding planes had been up that day - although no one can say for sure that their efforts were responsible for the rain . <p> Novak was just relieved to have the season over . <p> " They used to say you 'd have one good year every three years , " he says , a well-worn gim me cap pulled low over his blue eyes , grain dust pressed into the sweat-stained fibers of his work clothes . " One sorry year , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weather seems so messed up , I do n't know . " <p> There are some constants to farm life , regardless of the weather : Work starts at daybreak , and there 's always plenty of it . <p> But this summer 's harvest was easier , in a perverse way , simply because there was so much less to mow with the combine and haul to the nearest grain elevator . No need to hire extra hands , because there was nothing the 42-year-old Novak could n't handle with the help of his 12-year-old son , Ryan . <p> Ryan Novak is a freckled , wiry version of his father , a boy who was steering a tractor by the age of 8 and driving a mammoth combine by the age of 11 . He pores over farm-equipment catalogs the way other boys might sports magazines . <p> He hopes to join his father in the fields full time and eventually take over . But any fourth generation on the Novak family farm is likely to be far different from those that came before it . <p> Charles ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when his parents boarded a ship with him en route to America from their native Czechoslovakia in 1920 , ultimately settling in Black Hill , a tiny farming community a dozen miles east of Pleasanton . <p> Back then , the 30 or so miles separating the farm from San Antonio to the north seemed farther , without the video stores and fast-food restaurants that now spill across Pleasanton , for better or worse linking the area to the rest of the country . <p> And back then , the family farm was n't an endangered species , forcing those who stubbornly clung to its way of life to find a second , outside income to survive . <p> Reminders of the past surround the farmhouse where Charles Novak lives with his wife , Julie , an accountant , and their two children , Ryan and 9-year-old Sarah Beth . <p> Next door is the house where Novak 's mother , Mary , has lived alone since her husband died . Just down the road , the small , wooden house where Louis Novak grew up is still standing , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Of all agricultural pursuits , farming is the most solitary . Ranchers are always on the go , buying and selling cattle , cutting deals . But farmers labor alone atop their tractors , inside their air-conditioned combines , under the roofs of open-sided metal sheds where they repair equipment that seems to break down constantly . <p> They grow comfortable with solitude , take pleasure in whatever lies before them . <p> Novak says he considered leaving the farm , maybe going to college to become a veterinarian . " But at the last minute , I backed out and went into farming , because it seemed good ( financially ) at the time . " <p> That was in 1974 , the year he graduated from Pleasanton High School , and for the next two decades he shared the farm and its duties with his father . Louis Novak died of cancer three years ago at the age of 74 . <p> Charles Novak and Julie Persyn met while she was a student at Texas Tech University in Lubbock , introduced by his best friend and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been told about " this bachelor farmer from Black Hill " and , although she had n't grown up on a farm , her father had , and she thought she was prepared for that world . <p> They married in 1984 , not long after she graduated from college , and she discovered what she had gotten herself into . <p> There was the telephone party line they shared with Novak 's parents and several other Black Hill families for the first three years . <p> There was the 20-minute drive into town for a loaf of bread . <p> And there was the house . They moved a farmhouse onto the farm and fixed it up , but it was n't air-conditioned for the first few years , due to Novak 's belief that working in the sweltering fields would be easier if he did n't become accustomed to the artificial chill . <p> Charles Novak works eight or nine hours a day in the winter , depending upon the sunlight , and often takes Sundays off ; 14-hour days , seven days a week , are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , works four days a week for an accounting firm in north San Antonio . She also keeps the books for the farm . <p> Even in a good year , the latter chore is a grim reminder of current farm finances . <p> She figures her husband earns maybe $ 5 an hour for his time when the harvest is good - less than minimum wage , when you consider that he works far more than 40 hours a week . When it 's bad , as it was this year , he works free , although crop insurance usually covers basic production costs , including seed , fertilizer and chemicals , which can run between $ 40,000 and $ 45,000 a year . <p> Insurance does n't cover the cost of additional overhead , such as new equipment . And that can be staggering . <p> The Novaks bought a new combine this spring - new to them , that is , although it 's actually 17 years old - for $ 28,000 . A new one could have cost more than six times that much . <p> But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a commercial harvester is expensive , too , so they found the money . <p> " People always ask how we do it , " Julie Novak says . <p> Her paycheck helps , of course , providing a financial base for the household . Otherwise , they pay cash . If they do n't have the money to pay for something , they do n't buy it . At the end of the year , they tally the results and see how they did . <p> And in good years , the farm 's earnings can make all the difference , adding an income that Julie describes as in the " low five figures " to the family coffers . <p> They raise cattle , too , selling off the calves when the crops fail , keeping them to fatten when they can afford to wait . This year , they 'll sell . <p> In the meantime , Julie Novak drives a 1989 Chevrolet Suburban with more than 179,000 miles on it . Replacing it with a new one is out of the question - $ 30,000 for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerably cheaper for the hourlong commute to work . <p> She is a delicate-skinned redhead , poorly constituted for laboring in heat-drenched fields . But like any adult on a family farm , she has put in her time driving tractors and otherwise lending a hand during the busy seasons . She also has held outside jobs , working at least part time during their entire marriage . <p> In years like this , her husband says , " she 's putting food on the table . " <p> The changing reality of farm life has even filtered down to 9-year-old Sarah Beth , who is active in 4-H , raising her first pig last year and participating in food and clothing competitions . In a nod to the outside jobs now held by many farm wives , the clothing category no longer requires that clothes be sewn at home . " It 's shopping for clothes , " Julie Novak says . " None of the moms have time to sew . " <p> Time for traditional activities is just one of the sacrifices farm wives make these days . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearing , the inability of families to get away from the farm for more than a day or two . <p> Novak himself , so bound to his land that he has never been in an airplane , says he would like to travel , to see Colorado and the Grand Canyon someday , but he also knows that this is the life they have . <p> For now , their only escapes will be brief , like the quick trip they made to Houston and Galveston in late July . <p> " I guess she loves me , " he offers in simple explanation of his enduring marriage . <p> As a dryland farmer - none of the 1,000 acres he farms is irrigated - Novak is especially vulnerable to the weather . <p> Most farms in Atascosa County are irrigated . Interstate 37 , which cuts north-south through the county , is considered a dividing line : Any land west of I-37 is deemed too dry even to consider farming without supplemental water . <p> Novak 's farm lies less than 10 miles east of that artificial divide , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his odds in the high-stakes game he plays every year . But drilling a well would cost $ 60,000 , a pump and motor could add $ 20,000 , and the most water-efficient irrigation systems cost an additional $ 40 or so an acre . <p> Even with increased production , the numbers just do n't add up , he says . Market prices are too low to ever allow him to earn that money back . <p> Novak grows wheat and grain sorghum , traditionally good dryland crops , and his wheat did well this year , thanks to a rainy winter and early spring . But the grain sorghum withered , and a field of corn -a crop so thirsty he usually does n't even dare to plant it - died outright . <p> He also planted hay grazer for his cattle and baled the stubble from the grain sorghum to stretch his feed supply because the pastures had become too dry to sustain the cows months earlier . <p> " I 'm going to be 43 this October , and I thought I was old enough to know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaking his head in bafflement . " Usually , when you have a good planting season , you get a good crop . " <p> Not this year , when the winter 's plentiful rains abruptly stopped in March , providing Ryan with an early lesson on the vagaries of the weather . <p> He loves farming , loves the quail and jackrabbits and other wildlife on the land . His first word was " tractor , " his favorite toy a miniature John Deere . And he insists , despite his mother 's concerns that he is missing out on his childhood , that he wants nothing so much as to help his dad on the farm this summer . <p> Even if that means seeing the land at its worst . " It 's a lot drier now , " he says , sitting in the 25-foot-long grain truck he has wrestled next to a field where Novak is running the combine . " When you plowed it up in the spring , you could smell the moisture in it . Now you ca n't . It 's dust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this summer , rise around the truck as Ryan lounges inside , sweat streaming down his face , a cooler filled with Gatorade and water at his feet , waiting for the combine to reappear and dump its load . <p> Novak laughs at the advice of friends to " take that boy fishing , because he does n't know anything but farming . " But he is proud of Ryan 's devotion to the family business , and dependent upon his help . <p> His mother is proud , too , even if a part of her worries about what that means for his future . " Already he absolutely lives and breathes it , " she says . " When he goes to bed at night , he 'll take a farm magazine . I 'm just , ' Oh , man . ' " <p> He used to protest that , like his father , he did n't need college . That 's changed , with both parents insisting that farming is different now , that computers and other technology will make a college degree essential in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family computer , but his will be the last generation of farmers for whom that is a possibility . Already he uses a cellular phone in the fields , and he had a fax machine installed to make it easier to order parts . <p> Farming has changed , yes . But Julie Novak has no illusions that her husband would be happy doing anything else . <p> " The other day he came in , and he was mad . The combine had broken down , and he said he was going to look for a job . <p> " I said , ' What would you do ? ' And he just said , ' I do n't know . ' " <p> The state does n't keep exact statistics , but more and more farmers surrender after every bad year , with fewer young farmers arriving to take their place . <p> Not only are the numbers dwindling , but " they 're getting older , too , " says Beverly Boyd of the state Department of Agriculture . " We have an aging farm population . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ranching , but 20 percent owe their jobs to the agricultural industry , Boyd says . <p> And those people will be hurt by this year 's drought , too . <p> Researchers at Texas A &M; University estimate about 40,000 Texans will lose their jobs as a result of the drought - people in processing , transportation , advertising , and retail and wholesale sales . <p> The impact already has been felt in Atascosa County . <p> " When you live in a rural community like this , any business person will tell you the weather has a big impact on the economy , " says County Commissioner Tommy Shearrer , who raises cattle and works for a peanut company in the county seat of Jourdanton . " If it 's raining and life is good , people will spend ( money ) . " <p> The solution , as Shearrer and a growing number of other people see it , is more rain . <p> Critics worry about tampering with nature and about too much rain at the wrong time . But cloud seeding - " weather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ erase images of con men preying upon desperate farmers - is increasingly used in Texas , thanks to a $ 4.5 million grant state legislators approved last year . <p> Mention cloud seeding , and you can still evoke memories of the drought of the 1950s . <p> " That brought such hardship that people emptied their pockets and swallowed the pitch by some who were doing primitive cloud seeding , only to be disappointed , " says George Bomar , meteorologist for the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission and the state 's leading authority on cloud seeding . <p> The longest-running cloud-seeding program in the state operates out of Big Spring , northeast of Midland , where meteorologists have worked for 24 years to increase the water supply . <p> Research has shown that rainfall during the growing season increased between 27 percent and 42 percent above the long-term average , Bomar says . <p> That 's an average . " Some years are lean in terms of the number of days with seedable convection ( clouds ) , " he says . " This is one of those years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . We can not make a cloud , and even the clouds that may materialize , many of them just may not be seedable . " <p> Even if they are , meteorologists say they can be unpredictable , dumping their bounty anywhere within - or even outside - the project boundaries . Worst of all are days with no clouds in sight , a reminder that even the most ambitious program ca n't break the grip of a devastating drought . <p> But cloud seeding has never been more widespread in Texas , boosted by the Legislature 's $ 4.5 million appropriation to pay half the cost . That is matched by water districts and other local entities that sponsor the work . <p> A San Angelo-based project started three years ago , the South Texas project based in Atascosa County started last year , and a Lubbock-based project began earlier this year . <p> Other projects are planned for the San Antonio and border areas . <p> Each program is headed by a meteorologist , who relies upon radar to find and track clouds with enough moisture to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meteorologist at the South Texas project , says he looks for cumulus clouds - big , fluffy clouds with towering , water-filled sections - that are already raining , although the rain may never hit the ground without a boost . <p> He then dispatches one or both of two Aztec twin-engine jets based at Stinson Field in south San Antonio . ( Horn works at the Pleasanton airport , but the runway there is too short to accommodate the jets . ) After he guides them to the cloud , the pilots take over , dropping flares of silver iodide from a rack mounted on the plane 's underbelly . <p> Pilots release the flares above the clouds , or from underneath , allowing them to catch an updraft into the cloud 's center . <p> Horn works for Atmospherics Inc. , a Fresno , Calif. , company that provides a meteorologist , pilots and planes - all on call 24 hours a day . He has to be prepared for anything . <p> " The atmosphere , even though I have a degree in meteorology , sometimes it amazes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it has mostly dismayed . <p> Several attempts at seeding last spring were disrupted by smoke from agricultural fires in Mexico and Central America . Other clouds dissipated before the planes arrived . Too often , there have been no clouds at all . <p> He and Shearrer , who serves as chairman of the South Texas Weather Modification Association , say it 's too early to gauge the results . Unofficially , they think it is working . <p> " I do n't think we can afford not to do it , " Shearrer says . " I do n't think it 's a solution , but it 's one more tool . " <p> The association covers about 5 million acres in Atascosa , Bee , Frio , Karnes , Live Oak , McMullen and Wilson counties . With a five-month operating schedule , May through September , Shearrer figures it costs 8 cents an acre , half of that paid by the state . <p> " If you get one rain you were n't going to get , what 's the value of that ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drought will go for $ 50 or $ 60 , and that wo n't feed but 30 or 40 head of cattle for one day . " <p> Texas ' most catastrophic drought of the century , without question , hit in the 1950s . <p> It actually began in the spring of 1949 in the Rio Grande Valley ; it had spread across the state by the summer of 1951 . <p> By the end of the following year , the water shortage was critical . <p> Streams trickled or dried up completely . Wells dropped to record levels . Grazing land went bare , and stock water became critically short or nonexistent . <p> In the cities , lawns parched as water was used and reused for more crucial chores . <p> A series of slow , soaking rains throughout the state in the late winter and spring of 1957 finally signaled the end . <p> Elaine Franklin , county judge of McMullen County and matriarch of a well-known ranching family there , remembers those years as incredibly harsh . <p> She married into the Franklin family and moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We did n't have a well to provide water ( for livestock ) , " she says . " We finally had to sell or give the cattle away because there was n't any water , or anything for them to eat . <p> " It was a terrible time . " <p> And this year 's drought , coming so soon after the ' 96 drought that nearby Choke Canyon Lake has n't yet had time to recover , has many people thinking back to those years . <p> " Some of our people feel it 's as bad now as it was then , " says Franklin , who succeeded her husband as county judge after his death in 1990 . " It just has n't lasted as long , and hopefully it wo n't . " <p> Even if it does , it 's hard to imagine Novak walking away from farm life . <p> Why ? He has no real answers . He thinks about a friend who , disgusted with low prices and unpredictable weather , chucked farming and went to work as a chemical salesman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> He 's farming again . <p> " Farming just gets in your blood , " Novak says , a fate he has no expectation of changing . " When the weather conditions are right , . . . putting a little seed in the ground and watching it grow , it 's so rewarding . " <p> But is that enough to make him want this cycle of hope and heartbreak for his son ? <p> Yes , he says , pausing to add just a slight caveat : " If the weather would straighten up and we could grow crops , we could put up with the low prices . That just comes with it . " <p> Julie Novak may have qualms about such a difficult and uncertain future for her son , but for herself , the small satisfactions of farm life still make up for the hardships . <p> " No complaints , " she says . <p> Her husband , despite his frustrations , tends to agree . <p> " Years like this make you think about getting out , " he admits . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else I 'd do that I 'd enjoy .
