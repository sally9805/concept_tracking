Take the rebel romanticism of Jodeci and the pleading sincerity of Boyz II Men , and add a dash of the martial-arts mythologizing of the Wu-Tang Clan . Let simmer , and you 'd have something approximating the R.-and-B. vocal quartet Dru Hill . Dru Hill 's vocal recipe does n't always work  --  the group sometimes settles for flashy sentiment instead of striving for true emotion . Still , numbers like the thoughtful remake of The Love We Had ( Stays on My Mind ) and the delicately felt ballad Angel make this CD really cook . <P>  --  By Christopher John Farley
