It 's so easy to be sure about things you ca n't be sure about ! Photograph Photograph <p> Twenty-First Century A.D. Topaz and sapphire , the half sphere of Earth spun slowly below them . The sun winked on the horizon as the shuttle passed over the Australian coast . Byron shivered with the unfortunate symbology and hoped it was n't prophetic . The human race had turned inward , had stepped back , abandoning Mars missions and the moon colony alike . He feared it would also lose this last foothold off the planet . Nervous fingers rolled his keepsake . The small , tarnished coin flickered over and under his knuckles . The silent interplay was not lost on his guest . " You are uneasy , Liaison Holt . Are you afraid of what I might find ? " The thick Brazilian accent conveyed challenge . Byron was worried .

" And yes , I 'm concerned . We 're just making it as it is . Budget cutbacks cause hardships . " Dias " not-quite-smile was ironic . " The entire world is suffering , Mr. Holt . Many people will have to learn to do with less . " His eyes glittered , then darkened . The sun slipped out of sight . The lights of the Newcastle-Sydney metroplex flickered into vision below them before passing from their view . Byron 's cheeks smarted with the insult . The drastic warming trends had hit the American heartland hardest of all . Famine was as much an American problem as it was for the developing world . He resisted the urge for a defensive reply .

I 'm more concerned with the billions of hungry mouths than I am with the career interests of a few hundred engineers and scientists . " Byron squeezed hard on the ancient coin . " Biosphere is also an agricultural habitat , Investigator Dias . By studying the ecologies we maintain , we can learn much about the environment of our planet . " He felt himself slipping into the old , familiar speech . " Biosphere III is the next step towards developing self-sufficient space colonies . One day we 'll practice space agriculture on a large scale . " Dias pulled at the cuffs of his gray suit . Byron had been unable to convince the man to don the more comfortable jumpsuits that most space veterans wore . While prepping at Baikonur prelaunch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lizardskin boots-so much for conservation . The incident had not encouraged him . With a rising desperation , he tried to pull the Treasury officer 's attention from the window to himself . " We 're learning here how to more cleanly and efficiently utilize our resources . Eventually we 'll be able to counter the greenhouse effect . " Dias glared back at him . " Always promises . Always later . You tell others to wait , to be satisfied with their lot , that progress is coming . I say to you , Liaison Holt , what progress , what efficiency ? " He gestured around him at the cramped confines of the modified Buran shuttle . " You can not even utilize your own launch vehicles . " Accentuating this point , the length of their impromptu ferry shuddered as the new , experimental M.P.D. engines rumbled into life . The Russian pilot 's voice crackled over the intercom . " Secondary burn initiated . Our esteemed passengers are requested to remain strapped in . " Dias grunted . " It 's time to share . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest of us to bear its burdens .

" Despite the primitive accommodations , these socialists have surpassed you with their magneticion- " " Magnetoplasmodynamic , or M.P.D. " " What ? " The man 's ignorance amazed Byron . Their Russian hosts were cordial , conducting the United Nations guests over a complete tour of the sprawling Kosmograd space complex . The Ukrainian guide had been amiable and instructive , but Dias had not benefitted from the dis cussion . He had clung to the heated confines of their Mercedes landcruiser while the tall blond Russian proudly pointed out that the vehicle had been constructed at the nearby plant at Tyuratam , " Another example of the union of Russian technology and German money . " Dias had n't heard , only complained bitterly about the cold , staring with an equally frozen expression at the barren expanses of central Asian steppes . Dias had n't liked Russia . Byron wondered if the man liked anything . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old shuttle was refurbished to accelerate ionized gas via magnetic fields . It 's a separate technology from the A.S.P. , but it 's not as if we 're keeping secrets from each other . They were very kind to put us up when the Australian launch fell through . " The other nodded . " Exactly what I mean . How can you ask the rest of the world to walk a narrow path when your own house is n't in order ? " Byron took a deep breath . " As you said , we live in trying times . And we 've made many mistakes . No one is denying that . " He balanced the silver coin on the acceleration couch , watched it slide back from the artificial gravity induced by the Buran 's acceleration . " Now is the time to pull together . History has shown that humanity is largely dependent on the environment . " Byron paused , sadness evident on his features . " We 're good at controlling things . Perhaps we should n't have tried so hard to separate ourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Brazilian 's bronzed fingers closed over it first . " Why are you constantly playing with this thing ? " The Treasury officer peered more closely at the relic . The visage of some forgotten ruler , shaved face exuding strength , stared back from the ancient metal . A lionskin crowned the head . Dias appeared hypnotized by the coin . Byron leaned over and gently pried it loose . " It 's kind of a good luck charm commemorating the founding of Alexan dria . I picked it up in Athens , back at the Olympics of " 24 . " Dias " manner softened . " Who was he ? " Byron ran a finger lightly over the aged surface . " He was a man with a dream , someone who set out to change his world . His conquest of Persia brought East and West together . " Byron could n't help but think of their current impasse . " We could use some of his vision . " Fourth Century B.C.  --  Scenario A ( Drought ) The long winter persisted , and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thaw delayed . The headwaters of the river Granicus ran low . It promised to be a boring campaign , with few battles between the long marches . Thus it was that Alchylus was unprepared when his friend Parchas rushed up with the news . Ho , Alchylus , have you heard ? The scouts have returned . " The younger trooper wheezed , trapped between excitement and the fatigue of his run . The sunburned Macedonian scratched his beard in irritation , took one last look at his handiwork . The newly polished shinguard displayed the dents of several battles . Alchylus spat . " Have you lost your senses , boy ? Look around you . " The Illyrian recruit blinked , scanned the immediate vicinity . As far as they could see stretched the bare rock and hard soil of a land not wholly released from winter 's cruel grip .

We 'd crack them like a nut between the heavy cavalry and our phalanxes . The water 's too low . No , they will wait for Darius , and pull us further into this desolate land . Gods , I miss the crimson poppies of Pella already . " Parchas " jaw set in a stubborn line . " It 's true , and I heard the king will be personally inspecting all the units . " The grizzled soldier paused . " Himself ? Well , why did n't you say so ? " Alchylus snatched up discarded equipment . " This place is a mess . Do n't just stand there . Lend a hand . " Experts at camping in the field , the two companionably and efficiently straightened up the area . " You 're sure it will be Him ? " " As certain as my spear arm strikes true . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit . Alchylus strapped on his shortsword . Last time He spoke with me . You recall , when my feet were blistered ? Actually looked at them Himself , said I should be fine . " The gruff face beamed with pride at the memory . " Maybe He will let us fight in the vanguard . " The younger man 's eyes were round . Alchylus laughed . " No , that 's the honor of the foot companions , but I 'm sure you will get your fill of Persians . " The thought calmed the pikeman . " But , I do n't understand why they offer battle . This could end up being easier than pacifying the hill-land tribes . I figured Memnon had more smarts to him . " That night He did indeed speak with them , mesmerizing them with His smooth-shaven countenance and flowing gold hair . He said they would fight bravely , and somehow they knew they would . They slept with dreams of glory . At dawn the bulk of the army crossed the shallow waters , and crushed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the interior lay open . The local villages welcomed them with little fanfare and bartered local Asian wares for the troopers " silver staters , the coins that bore the likeness of their king . The west had come to the east . Twenty-First Century A.D. The two had spent the last few minutes in an uneasy silence . Dias mulled over the liaison 's words . Byron , on the other hand , nursed a budding hope and left the Brazilian to himself . Time stretched on , and Byron could imagine the dispersed structure of Biosphere m drawing ever closer . Onward and upward the shuttle glided , threading the near-vacuum in a curving arc towards its destination . The flight from Earth to station , perhaps the end of the dream to which he had devoted the last decade of his life , loomed more inevitable with each passing moment . Involuntarily Byron peeked over at Dias . The small man , deep in thought , took no notice . Byron tried to resign himself . Either Dias would see reason or he would not . Tired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window The pilot rolled the shuttle to approach Biosphere , blocking Earth from sight . Only the blackness of space greeted his search for reassurance . Strange how far away the stars could seem . Byron brooded , moody gaze intent on everything and nothing . The effect was so subtle in coming that at first he scarcely noted it . Eventually the strangeness began to impinge on his consciousness . Sparks , dim firefly flecks , streamed past the window . Byron leaned forward to catch a better view . Forward and out of sight sat the shuttle 's nose and crew compartment . To the rear . . . Byron caught his breath . The short , stubby wings of the altered Buran swept back . An orange halo danced about them . Ghostlike , ranging from yellow to dull red , it dung to the fringes of the shuttle . Byron 's preoccupation brought the U.N . officer out of his reverie . Dias struggled with his harness to get a closer look . " What is happening out there ? , The liaison did n't shift his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n't seen it in years . " Dias shifted uncomfortably . " Is it dangerous ? " This time Byron did look at him . " No , it 's just another difference between the Russians " technology and ours . It has to do with atomic oxygen . You do n't get much of the effect with our craft since we started shielding with the new zirconium-halfnium ceramics . The A.S.P. is a giant step forward . " There you go with that again . What is this A.S.P. you keep talking about ? " " The Asp ? Byron was surprised and subtly pleased by Dias " questions . " The Aero Space Plane , the world 's first ram/scram-jet hybrid . " At the smaller man 's blank look Byron continued . " The lift vehicle we were scheduled to take before the launch was scrubbed . Dias paused , thought hard . " And you are not upset at having to accept charity from these Russians ? " Byron grinned . " I would n't call it charity . Lift costs have plunged , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always looking for a fresh infusion of dollarks . " A conciliatory attitude towards a nation you spent half a century prepared to atomize . " " Some of us would like to think that we 're learning to live with each other and our planet . The Russians maintain a space program apart from the United Nations , as you well know , but I would n't classify them as adversaries . We try to get along . " Dias face still held a trace of mockery . " Especially when your own systems are not working . " For a brief second Byron was confused . " Is that what you thought ? The Asp has performed flawlessly . No , we lost our ride when operations were temporarily suspended at the request of the Australian government . " Dias feigned shock . " Will wonders never cease , Western powers bowing to the requests of a smaller country ? " Byron frowned . " Treasury officer Dias , I was born in the States , and much of my work is with Berlin and Washington . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.N . ' s World Development Council . I believe that I 've achieved broadened loyalties . " Dias slowly nodded . " Perhaps , that is what I am to determine . You will be heard , Liaison Holt . I owe you that . " Another pause . " Old divisions die hard . " Byron suspected that such an admission came hard for a proud man like Dias . " You are familiar with the Asian resettlement program ? " It was Dias " turn to nod knowingly . " Yes , the second Cambodian debacle , and the Honshu earth movements four years ago . I was on the committee that approved the budget for the sealift . What they 've achieved in the desert is remarkable . " " I agree . That was sand and rock a decade ago when the first Asp strips were laid . Now the landings are rattling quite a few cages . Eyre Lake is n't the isolated spot it once was . " " Meaning ? " " Noise pollution . The sonic booms have upset more than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're looking for other corridors . " Window forgotten , Dias sat back to consider Byron 's statements . Gentle pressure tried to pull them from their harnesses . Sunlight poured through the aperture as the shuttle slid forward to dock . " We 're about there . " Apprehension and eagerness mixed within Byron . Dias groped for words . " I 'm impressed with your candor , Liaison Holt . Your ability to admit that the West had made mistakes is . . . unexpected . " Byron nodded . Dias pressed on . " After we dock I 'll be busy with officials and politics . You said that Biosphere III could be an answer to global warming and the famine . Explain yourself . " You might be surprised how closely related history and ecology are . " Dias motioned for him to continue . Byron plunged ahead . " It 's long been known that man affects his environment , often adversely . Recent examples include the Russians " destruction of the Aral Sea and the depletion of your own rain forests in Brazil . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's not that simple . Nature also affects us , and history can hinge on this . For instance , what if tardy winds had not delayed William the Conqueror and the Normans had met a fresh Saxon army rather than one tired by a previous battle with the Norwegians ? It could have changed the course of English history . " " A typical Western example , " noted Dias with asperity . " But an accurate one . And it can develop into a negative feedback type of situation . Man affects nature which in turn affects man , and so on . " " That is not necessarily a bad thing , " interrupted the Brazilian . " Progress has its price . " " True enough , but even minimal changes in the environment can boomerang . Case in point-the so called " little ice age " during the medieval era . Average worldwide temperatures plunged a mere half-degree , yet this was enough to ruin the agricultural infrastructure and destroy the Viking colony on Greenland . Thus the Scandinavians never pressed further west @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoken a Norse dialect instead of Portuguese . " " And this relates to Biosphere III ? " " Carbon dioxide levels have more than doubled in the past fifty years to six hundred parts per million . Global temperatures are up almost two degrees Celsius . We ca n't even begin to gauge the effects on the jetstream and the oceans , though the cause for the cropkills and the famine is pretty obvious . The Biosphere has several self-contained modules that duplicate Earth habitats . We can control the climates , experiment with what might be going wrong . " And then learn what to do right . I understand the concept . But tell me , could n't you instead do this more cheaply on the surface ? " " Some of it . However , Biosphere III is much more . We 're looking at breakthroughs in agriculture , life support technologies , developments in alternative fuels and medicine . There 's even talk about utilizing photosynthesis as an alternative energy source . " Dias almost chuckled . Byron waited , expectation and enthu- : siasm buoyant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -I can make no promises , but I will try to judge fairiy . " " That 's all I ask . " A slight nudge preceded a hollow clicking sound . The intercom chimed . " Honored guests , we have arrived at Biosphere . " Byron cursed the Russians for their lack of a warning , but his heart was n't in it . He was thinking of reprieves . Fourth Century B.C.  --  Scenario B ( Temperate ) It was a fine morning . The foreign skies of Asia Minor promised riches , an empire to be plundered . Philip 's son , king and general , descendant of Achilles , had returned from His quest . Now , armed with the shield of his ancestor , He would lead them into Persia . The signs were auspicious , the weather ideal . Thus , they struck quickly . A short crossing took thirty-five thousand rough-hewn Macedonian veterans , heroes of Charonea all , to the doorstep of the ancient enemy . Like a colossus it stretched , from the Dardanelles to the Indian Punjab , from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ task lay before them . More immediate a problem was the horde of howling barbarians clustered across the river . Alchylus tightly grasped his weapons . He hefted the round wicker shield up higher . " Look at them , Parchas , acting like they have no fear in the world . " He peered over at his friend . Parchas " face was mostly hidden under the blue flanges of his Phrygian helmet . He made no answer . " Nervous , boy ? " Parchas thickly swallowed , indicating agreement . " As are they . " Alchylus pointed to the wild mass of Asiatic horsemen . " They try to convince themselves otherwise with all that noise , but they 're not real soldiers . " Several of the tunic-clad archers pulled back their shortbows . The arrows fell harmlessly into the water The time for talk ended . The missiles had come too close . The order went out , and all but the first five ranks raised their sarissas , fifteen-foot-long pikes , to cover their heads from further attack . The mighty phalanx , long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The breastplate chaffed , and the kilt itched . " Alchylus ignored the symptoms , started to look for his first opponent . Waves of light cavalry pressed upon the other shore . His vision fastened on an area of calm . Memnon and his Greek mercenaries stood disciplined and ready . Alchylus burned with hatred . " Damned hoplite traitors . " He prayed to whatever gods who were listening that the flow of battle would take them in that direction . The Macedonian trooper was so fixated on his bloodlust that he almost did n't see the attack when it came . A movement caught his eye , and he whirled right . His mouth popped open in dismay . " He 's attacking by Himself . " The ground shook , as capes flying , the massed heavy cavalry of the Royal Squadron , the Agema , crashed across the waters . The two troopers , and many of their comrades , stood amazed and dumbfounded . " They 'll never make it , " yelled Parchas . And yet , through the hail of arrows , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Persian line buckled as the serrated ranks of javelins drove home . For a brief instant Mchylus saw a lone helmet , crowned by twin white plumes , in the lead . Of course this would be so-He was impulsive and impossibly brave , born to unite all men under one rule . The men would follow Him to the ends of the Earth . " And why are we not following ? " muttered Alchylus . The signal was given as Lord Parmenion ordered the rest of the army into the fray . The phalanx charged into the beachhead the cavalry had carved . The Persians fought bravely , but stood no chance against Macedonian discipline . They had a hard day of it , but at length the enemy broke , and He had His first victory in Asia . Alchylus suspected that there were tougher times ahead . Twenty-First Century A.D. Byron and Dias relaxed in the earthsider visitors " quarters . The Treasury officer had n't taken well to low gravity , and spent much of his time in the modules situated low down on Biosphere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small tube of wine . Byron watched with keen interest . " What do you think ? " " What , the station or the wine ? " " Both . " " The wine is dry , but I like it . It must have been quite expensive to import . " He swished more of the pale violet liquid in his mouth . " Actually , we 're considering exporting under our own label . " The Brazilian 's eyebrows rose . " You made this here ? " " Home grown , home bottled . " " Impressive . The entire setup , that is . " " Then , you will recommend that we keep our funding ? " " I can not say for sure . I 've seen much on which I must think , and I have my own battles to fight . However , your people here have been most helpful , and have answered all my questions with honesty and enthusiasm . " The dark man searched for words . " They seem filled with a sense of expectation . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Dias rose , slowly worked his way over to the pod 's lone window . From this angle one could look " up " at much of the thousand-foot-plus length of Biosphere III . Clusters of modules , buttressed by kevlar tethers , squatted about the habitat 's axis like bugs on a stalk . Shadows lengthened as Biosphere 's slow rotation brought the sun into view . Still queasy , Dias turned away . It does take some getting used to. , Byron 's tone was sympathetic . Dias sat . " Space is not for everyone , but I will agree with you that it has much to offer the human race . I was especally taken by the crops . " " You mean the intensive agriculture biomes ? We 're not yet prepared to feed your hungry billions , but we 're close to self sufficiency . " Byron pulled out his coin . " You have to crawl before you can wk . " " The coin again . " " He was an inspiration , if a little before his time . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B.C. " " And it is now ? " " One can only hope . " Byron switched to a lighter subject . " I 'm glad you enjoyed your stay . " Dias slowly nodded . " That is one way to phrase it . Rest assured that my report will be complete . " He looked back up . " The newness of it all is overwhelming . " " It 's not that new . " " Oh ? " " The concept actually originated late in the twentieth century . Biosphere II was a small world unto itself . A group of scientists assembled it out on the Arizona desert . There were a lot of problems , and people at the time thought they were wasting their efforts . But , the concept was sound , if not popular . " " Much the same as the situation you face now . And what of Biosphere I ? " " That 's the planet . " Byron smiled at the look of surprise . " Biosphere I is Earth itself , the greatest experiment of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " own . " And thank you for the history lesson . You are very good at what you do . " The American sketched a brief bow , then sobered . " Your shuttle is due within the hour " " Yes , duty beckons . " Dias patted his stomach . " I wish I could say that I would miss this place , or the ride back to the docking bay . " As Dias said this Byron crossed the small room and punched in a command on the thouchscreen . Upstation from them a small cubicle slid on its magnetic cushion down the shaft of the Biosphere . " Your trusty steed is on its way . I have a parting gift for you . " Dias " eyebrows rose . " Indeed ? " He stared curiously at the transparent sphere Byron handed to him . There were no visible openings . Small creatures flitted about in it . Dias inspected it more closely . " The sphere was made from a perfect crystalline compound , another small miracle brought to you from space . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seam . The structure was smooth to his touch . " And shrimp with a healthy dose of microbes . " " What is it ? " " It 's called an ecosphere . Early versions were developed by the old NASA . Biosphere , unlike the Earth , is not a totally self-contained system , at least not yet . These little worlds are . The one you 're holding has been going strong for over four years . " " Really . " Dias " hands moved as with a life of their own . " Just add sunlight . " " A microcosm . Byron Holt , you 've made your point . Not that I subscribe to everything you 've said . I agree that the greenhouse effect must be countered , but I think you overstate the impact the environment can have on our civilization . " Byron spun his keepsake , stuffed it into one of the many pockets of his jumpsuit . He hid his half-smile . A green light indicated the arrival of the shaft cubide . " I 'll see you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those Russian accommodations . " Fourth Century B.C. Scenario C ( Flood ) Clouds roiled in the west , harbingers of more difficulties to come . First had been the treacherous crossing of the Hellespont , then the gods " cursed drought with its cloying heat , and now this sudden storm . Waters , dangerously high , thrashed along the steep banks . Directly across from their position , horse archers shook their bows in defiance , but their cries were drowned out by the maelstrom . The omens had not been good . Alchylus was beginning to doubt the wisdom of this entire venture . The heat sapped the army , and morale sank when rumors reached them of a Spartan revolt back home . Then the rains had finally come on the eve of their first major encounter with their enemy . He eyed the surging floodwaters with foreboding . " No chance of crossing that . It might as well be the river Styx . " " What ? " came back Parchas " reply . Alchylus signaled for silence , and pointed to the low ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good . Now they could withdraw to a dry camp , perhaps pull back to the coast . They could not pick up the words , but it was evident that an argument ensued . Astride His powerful warhorse Bucephalus , the king exchanged angry gestures with dour Parmenion and young Philotas . " I wonder what that 's about ? " yelled Parchas over the thunder of the waters . " Do n't know , but look , it 's breaking up . " Thick drops of moisture splatted on the desiccated dust lately turned to mud . " More rain . Now is n't that odd , Him leaving the field to His marshal ? " The two could make no sense of it . Parmenion had just stared when the king rode off . Minutes later they had their answer . The royal cavalry trotted up to the torrent . Alchylus watched in horror as Bucephalus was urged into the froth . As one the bodyguards followed . " We have to help .

Many tried the waters , only to be swept away in the currents . Following a king to the end of the Earth is one thing , but the headlong plunge into certain death was a more final journey . The army wavered . Adding to the confusion was the sporadic missile fire rained down by the gleeful Persian . Alchylus Parchas tried , wallowed in the thick mire with hundreds of others , but it was hopeless . Then there came cheering from the Persian side , and a great wail from the Macedonian contingent . " The king is drowned . Alexander is dead . " Their officers immediately ordered a capable and fairly ordered withdrawal . The army escaped with few casualties . " I knew it , " Alchylus cried , " this strange flooding is a sign from the gods . We are undone . And now He is gone . " They wept all the way back to Macedonia . Twenty-First Century A.D.

" You would probably say that we 're making history ourselves , proof that our decisions on how we respond to the environment are more important than its effect upon us . " The younger man grinned . " You have me at a disadvantage there . It 's true that Biosphere needs your help . However , I could argue that our planet needs the help of this facility . " " You debate well .

" And that is why these minor temperature fluctuations will be overcome . What is a few degrees in the face of thirty centuries of culture and progress ? " Bahron did n't rise to the bait . " Your shuttle is waiting . Long live the Great King . " " And long live the Persian Empire . " The two men turned away , both intent on setting their world to rights . IN TIMES TO COME Our last issue of the 1900s has several unique features . Robert R.

He was right ! Our December issue will also feature an unusual experiment in collaboration with our sibling magazine , Asimov 's : a pair of " mirror novellas .
