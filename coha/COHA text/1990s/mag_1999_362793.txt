Give Bill Bradley credit for this much : he has put a big idea on the table . Not the $65 billion plan to provide health insurance for just about everyone ; not a social agenda extending full civil rights to gays ; not even the plan he unveiled last week to devote $10 billion to address the " slow-motion national disaster " of child poverty . No , the big idea was the very idea of having a big idea . <P> In the twilight of Clintonism , amid the debris of divided government , the question Bradley boots up is this : Are we finally prosperous enough , generous enough , and above all trusting enough to ask the government to do anything that 's big and important ? And if not now , when ? And if not government , working with churches and civic groups and businesses and individuals , then who ? It is Bradley 's challenge to every other candidate : Why should they not dare to dream heroic dreams ? as Ronald Reagan once put it . And now it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not always a good idea . " Big and bold is fine , " says an adviser to Al Gore . " Big and bold and unrealistic is not . " <P> In an interview with TIME last week , Gore let fire : he charged that Bradley would destroy programs such as Medicaid , that he takes " an old-style approach to poverty that spends a lot of money but does n't have any new ideas , " and would bust the budget besides . " When people have the time to analyze what he is actually proposing , " says Gore , " they 're in for a real surprise . " <P> At the dawn of Campaign 2000 it was the Republicans who were supposed to be host to a fight for the heart and soul of their party ; and yet , as another candidate folded her bumper stickers last week , the G.O.P. has all but crowned a front runner who never misses a chance to be seen talking about compassion in a colorful sea of children . And even as George W. Bush drives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is Al Gore who finds himself locked in what looks like a real philosophical battle over the future of the Democratic Party with a challenger who casts a very long shadow . <P> A lot has changed since the last time the Democrats had a primary fight on their hands . In 1992 Bill Clinton challenged his party to scrap the philosophy that had lost five of the past six elections and get back in touch with mainstream values : work , family , personal responsibility , free markets , accountable government . When he tried to do something very big , like overhaul the entire health-care system , it yielded a fiery Republican Congress . By 1996 , Bill Bradley had given up on politics and Bill Clinton had conceded that " the era of Big Government is over . " <P> So now the budget is balanced , even running a surplus , and the welfare rolls are down and incomes are up and government spending represents a smaller share of GNP than at any time since 1974 . And just when Al Gore finally gets his turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole life , along comes Bradley as if to say , Thanks , Al , for this great economy , but I 'm the only guy with the guts and imagination to know what to do with it .
