As a child she had kept a pony in a small stable behind her house . One afternoon , in a moment of pure misunderstanding of her own motives , she had encouraged it to bite her <p> BETH was going to learn Irish . She had gotten herself a slim illustrated book called Speak Irish Now . In it were pictures of kitchen implements , body parts , a hurley stick , sheep . But the words on the page were clusters of consonants , as indigestible as bricks . For instance , " d'fhanfadh . " For instance , " ndeachaigh . " Most of the words seemed to be about the same length . They were cunningly unphonetic ; they got shipwrecked in her windpipe . They were , as a woman from Donegal had once said of her countrymen , a clannish lot . After six years on Long Island , Beth had begun hassling Eamon about going home with him . No time , he 'd said ; no money . Then his father had unexpectedly bounced back from a pair of heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should spend his savings on tickets home . At JFK lightning storms delayed their flight . Eamon found a kiosk that sold only Murphy 's , and traded two five-dollar bills for flimsy plastic cups of stout . He held his high in the air . " You 're a great woman , so you are , " he told Beth . " It 'll be grand , you and my dad in McCormack 's for big filthy pints . For that alone he 'll want to marry you . " His sisters drank only creme de menthe . His brothers preferred German beer , lager after lager . His mother , now dead , had been a devoted whiskey drinker ; she finished a pint of Jameson 's each night and then filled the bottle with tea and milk for Eamon to take to school . " I was the only one who thought she drank the whole bottle so that I could have something to hold my tea in the morning , " he said . A zigzag of lightning cracked against the sky . Beth jumped . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Guinness and blackcurrant . For the nerves . " Beth was drawn to brogues , Emerald Isle kitsch , the shillelagh-and-tea-cloth brand of Irishness . Now she had invented a match game of family members and favorite drinks to help keep track of all the relatives-a kind of mnemonic device in a glass . She even had one for herself : a rich dark stew of stout and syrup . When at last their plane taxied down the runway and took off , the flight became an airborne booze cruise , the passengers " demands for little bottles of liquor noisy and unabating . Beth took out Speak Irish Now and read while she drank her little bottle of chardonnay . Foreign-language primers always seemed inordinately preoccupied with the weather . " I think it 's flichshneachta out there , " she said . What was that ? Eamon asked . " Sleet . " " You 'll get a lot of flichshneachta in Ireland , " he said . He explained Beth 's interest in the Irish language to the passenger beside them , an ancient man with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the shoulders of his suit jacket . " No one has Irish anymore , " the man said fiercely . He might have been objecting to shoes of a certain era , or an outdated dance step . He ceremoniously offered Beth a throat lozenge , and then joined Eamon in pretending they needed Beth to order extra cans of beer for them . When they stood to deplane in Dublin , the man offered Beth a cold hand . " Ni thabharfadh an duine sin deoch uisce duit , " he said , and then vanished . " What did he say ? " Beth whispered . " He said you would n't give a man a drink of water . " IT customs they had to separate ; Eamon and his Irish passport with a gold harp printed on the cover went to the left , Beth and her eagle-stamped one to the right . He walked backward and waved to her as he got in line with the other Irish citizens-a young mother with a yowling baby and three stooped old men . Eamon looked oversized among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brown down the front with stout . Yet Eamon was , after a decade in America , adulterated , only a partial Irishman , an uncomfortable Hibernian hybrid . " Resident alien , " the card in his wallet declared him , like some half-recognizable species-a turnip with a human head . He had always wanted to live here , he often said as they drove in heavy traffic toward Manhattan 's show-off of a skyline , but he had always wanted to stay back home . " My detoured leprechaun , " Beth told him , stroking the predictable cleft in his chin . " Cleft-chinned smithy of my soul . " But here they were , in the real Ireland , beyond the litter of Claddagh rings and Erin go bragh , the high-stepping of Riverdance on videocassette . Beth joined the long line for citizens of other countries , mostly Americans . Elderly members of a tour group were loudly exchanging greetings : " Top o " the morning to ye . " The customs agents in their booths looked upon everyone , Beth thought , with unchanging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such smarmy American aping of Irishness . Eamon himself hated Saint Patrick 's Day , with its green-beer drunkenness and plastic bowler hats . Once , she had gotten him a card with a shamrock on it , and he 'd laughed , but it had n't been the laugh she 'd wanted . They would be staying at the house of Eamon 's father , Paddy , the only place unpopulated by the brood of children his brothers and sisters had produced . Beth wished for a bedand-breakfast , someplace tidy and uninhabited by decay . She pictured Eamon 's father as a skeleton propped up in a corner , a death mask haunting a chair . Her grandfather had recently died after years suspended in dementia , as if in some viscous , clotty fluid . At the end he had thought he was a conductor on the Long Island Railroad , and then a baby who could n't get enough to eat . Beth had held his head up while her mother spooned strained bananas into his mouth , the two of them cooing at him in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closest she 'd ever felt to her grandfather . Had n't she once hoped that she and Eamon might find , in the sweaty , wordless aftermath of sex , a place like that , where language was no longer even necessary ? On this trip Beth would translate herself like a language , make of herself something as legible as block letters . She grinned at the customs official when she handed him her passport , and was disappointed when he did n't bother to wink or tell her to enjoy her stay in Ireland . Near the baggage carousel she found Eamon squatting on their suitcases and smoking a cigarette . " John Joe must 've had a desperate head on him this morning , " he said . He held up the keys to the car he 'd rented . " We 're on our own . " Driving to Eamon 's home town , Beth fretted . She clipped and unclipped the barrette in her hair , put on lipstick and then rubbed it off with a napkin , needled Eamon with questions . How Catholic was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't married ? Would they disapprove of her ? " For feck 's sake , Beth , " he said . He pointed to the greenand-yellow checkerboard flags flying in front of all the houses . They had entered his county . The All-Ireland Gaelic football final was coming up , he told her . No one would care if she were a one-legged Buddhist . Beth had noticed a lot of talk about Gaelic football in Speak Irish Now , much of it accompanied by cartoons depicting disgruntled spectators in striped jerseys . From what she could gather , this sport combined elements of soccer and American football , with a bit of dribbling the ball thrown in . " Ni bhuafaidh siad sin cluiche go deo , " one character said to another . " They 'll never win a match . " She had thought the scenery-cows blinking slowly in their pastures , the hills in their patchwork forty shades of greenwould calm her , but Eamon whipped so quickly around turns that her body set up a lurching metronomic rhythm . Finally she saw a crumbling stone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PAWS-A-WHILE . Outside Paws-A-While someone had hung a handmade sign that said SALE MANURE . " We 'll go see Paddy first , " Eamon said . He swung the car into a development signposted AVONDALE ESTATE . The word " estate " flooded her with a sense of largesse . As a child she had kept a pony in a small stable behind her house . One afternoon , in a moment of pure misunderstanding of her own motives , she had encouraged it to bite her . The pony had not seriously injured her , but not long afterward her mother sold it to the parents of a boy about her age . The stable had never been used again , except for trysts with boyfriends and a few unfortunate incidents with schnapps . She peered out at the squat gray two-story apartment buildings , row upon row of attached housing . Someone had draped all the hedges with green-and-yellow plastic banners . Checkerboard flags fluttered outside every apartment . A two-page color newspaper photo of the football team had been pasted on several windowpanes . UP MEATH was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars , BOO MAYO on others . From a second-story window a Meath jersey twisted on a hanger in the breeze . " Jaysus , the atmosphere is great , " Eamon said . From the center of Paddy 's yard a large bush shaped like a lopsided person waved , a flag jutting from a leafy fist . A green-and-yellow cap had been placed on top of the bush at a jaunty angle . " Jaysus , that 's great , " he said again . He kept shaking his head and smiling . Beth found herself possessed by a wish , for the first time in several years of courtship , to tell him to shut up . He suddenly seemed to her parochial and quaint , whereas in all the time she had known him , he had seemed charming and quaint . The sculpted bush was dumb . She felt embarrassed for the people with the jersey hanging in their window . They found Paddy watching television and eating tiny squares of cheese-and-tomato sandwich off a cutting board on his lap . " Beth , is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was lovely for a Yank . Tea and cigarettes and sandwiches were offered all around , the sandwiches so heavily peppered that Beth 's mouth felt sandy . It unnerved her that Eamon called his father by his first name . AFTER a day or so the jet lag receded , but Beth still felt soiled and disoriented . Paddy 's house did not seem to have any proper heat source . The shower head produced only a forlorn trickle . On the third morning she woke early and decided to make the tea . A lacy string of cobwebs stood between her and the inside of the china cabinet , where she could see a stack of teacups and a bottle of green liquid labeled Fairy Soap . She was trying to decide whether to put her hand through the cobwebs when Paddy joined her . He was a small , trim , vigorous man , despite a persistent wheeze that often escalated into fits of coughing . Eamon 's sisters had spoken as if Paddy were winding down toward his last days , but he looked bright with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attacks . " You do n't smoke , " he said , holding out his pack of cigarettes nonetheless , as if Beth might suddenly change her mind . " Do you take a drink ? " " Oh , yes , " she said . " I like a Guinness . " This seemed to cheer him considerably . " A lovely pint of Guinness , with a creamy head , " he said . Now hungry , apparently , he took an unlabeled glass jar from the refrigerator and began to feed hurriedly on its contents . Beth smelled vinegar . At lunch , which he called dinner , he peeled potatoes with his hands , making a pile of brown jackets on a saucer in the center of the table , and placed them in Beth 's bowl . When he was a boy , he said , everyone squatted in the middle of the floor and ate their potatoes out of the same big bowl . " The bollocks is making things up again , " Eamon said . Once , at an Irish pub in Manhattan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be security guards at a tampon factory in Hoboken had bought Beth drinks . Late in the evening , drunk , she had come out of the bathroom and heard them speaking to one another in a flat nasal accent that she immediately recognized as an imitation of her own . In that moment she had hated them , for their in-jokes , their unwavering nationalism , their milk-white skin and unabashed poverty , their habit of talking over and across her in Irish , a language no one else knew or cared to know . " Do you believe in the hereafter ? " Paddy asked . Beth saw that she had ploughed through all the potatoes he had given her . " I do n't know , " she said . " Eamon says you 're Jewish . " " Not really . " " What 's that ? Were you not born Jewish ? " " I was just born , " Beth said . He offered her his jar of pickled onions . Three still lolled at the bottom , submerged in murky vinegar like tiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , beaming at her . " They 're lovely . " With one hand he traced the route from his throat to his stomach . " Next time I 'll come back as a pint and go to a good home . " " Next time I want to come back Irish , " Beth said . She wanted to be a citizen of a country with its own enviably embarrassing cultural identity ( the cheerful , capering drunk ) , its own universally recognized songs and symbols and history ( " Danny Boy , " shamrock , famine ) , its own unpronounceable language cluttered with consonants . She pointed to the only things in the room whose names she could remember . " Cupan . Taephota . " Paddy winked at her . " Nil me ag caint Gaelige . " " You must have learned it in school . " " Sure , now , we were too busy fighting the Norsemen in those days to waste our time with the likes of school . " He winked , shrugged , and peeled more potatoes into her bowl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lounge of the Judge and Jury , Beth was persuaded to do a Jewish accent . She imitated her mother haranguing a saleswoman at the Clinique counter in Bloomingdale 's . " In the past few years my poas have gotten very large . Do you have something for large poas ? " Then her parents arguing over a bad investment her father had made in someone 's nephew 's foray into frozen pizza rolls . Then her father complaining about his sciatica . Most of this Beth invented as she went . Her parents were mild , **28;464;TOOLONG Jews , their income modest by Long Island standards . Still , Eamon 's family fanned out on either side of her , roaring . Eamon roared . " But they do n't really talk like that , sure they do n't , " his sister Siobhan said . " Sure they do . " Siobhan 's husband , John Joe , rested an elbow on a large fold of belly . He had an ulcer and kept singing " Desiree " - not the whole song but just the word . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beth sounded like Rhoda . Proof from television seemed to settle the matter . In America association with television seemed to discredit facts , but in Ireland , Beth thought , television seemed to stand as that which validated all claims . " You should see the house where Beth grew up , " Eamon was saying . " Like the mansion on Dynasty . " " Is it really ? " Siobhan asked . " That would be a gross exaggeration , " Beth said primly , but nobody heard her . Eamon was describing the maid 's quarters , the stable , the billiard room with the full bar , the ice machine , the monogrammed highball glasses . " But there 's nothing in the stables , " Beth insisted . " The stables are falling down . " Now they looked at Beth differently : inhabitant of mansions , owner of highball glasses . She had meant to distance herself from that , to align with Eamon , but now she felt herself to be a species apart from him and his family , with their forlorn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Waterford crystal from their weddings everywhere locked up and dusty , their unselfconscious public singing . Two young men with fiddles had wandered into the pub and begun to play . People sang along between swigs of stout , mispronouncing most of the words . They said " tree , " for instance , when they meant " three . " She wondered if she should drink more . She drank , the stout a brogue 's lubricant . It made her recoil from the sound of her American accent reverberating inside her head-the nasal monotony of it , the apathetic blah blah blah of someone middle-class , cushioned by the class below her . Someone raised by a mother who had time to worry about pores . Someone who could indulge a whim and get bitten by a pony or get drunk on melonberry schnapps . She had no tragic history to recall-only a road back through memory filled with the discarded gifts and purchases of an American childhood . John Joe was telling a story about going out for Chinese with a crowd in Navan . The taxi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by him and then by Siobhan . " Eejits , " Siobhan said , as if she were commenting on the behavior of some other drunk and foolish couple . " Drink up , lads , " the bartenders were calling . Though it was after midnight , the streets were busy with people walking home from the pubs , arm in arm or in unruly , shouting clusters . Eamon draped one arm around Beth 's neck , leaning heavily on her . They passed a butcher shop . The scarlet sides of meat hanging in the window affronted Beth . She had wanted to ask Eamon about the shops he had gone to as a child , the architecture of the Christian Brothers School , the fields where he 'd played Gaelic football . She 'd meant to ask about a statue of some English lord up by the hotel-an early colonizer ? " Oh , that , " Eamon said . " They 've been trying to blow that up for years . " He gestured toward his family , walking on ahead in the joyous and disorganized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around to anything . " " You did n't have to say that about Dynasty , " Beth said . " They liked your accent . They liked " poas . " " " They liked " poas , " " Beth said . " Great . " She felt glum and violated , like a bed someone had pissed in by accident , or a public pool with a warm spot . They went back to Siobhan and John Joe 's house , a messier twin of Paddy 's . John Joe , complaining of his ulcer , lay on the couch and drank milk from the carton . He was still singing " Desiree . " Siobhan clopped from one room to another , shouting at everyone to keep it down or the girls would wake up . The girls woke up and wandered in , barefoot and squinting , tangles in their hair . They nodded when Siobhan introduced them and had to be told to shake hands with Beth . The taller one , Nuala , prodded John Joe with a foot . " Drunk again ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's ? Have you a packet of crisps for me ? " The girls showed Beth their room . It seemed to be a converted storage area , with flimsy walls they had written on in pencil . More uP MEATH . More BOO MAYO . " If Meath win , everyone gets the day off from school , but if Mayo win , we do n't get the day off but the boys " school does , " Nuala said . The younger girl , Ciara , sucked her thumb and asked Beth if she could touch her hair . " You 're drunk too , " Nuala said . " You look like your father , " Beth said . " But not fat . " " And not drunk , " Beth said . That night the Guinness and black-currant made her hallucinate . She saw the world in triplicate , three turning orbs . Three of herself bought scarlet sides of beef in the butcher shop from a man without a tongue . At the top of a staircase she stood in mink , white diamonds dripping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dandruff-covered shoulders grabbed her and cackled sour syllables into her mouth . She felt a presence next to her , an arm slung around her waist . She got out of bed . The long tiled hallway felt as slick as a frozen pond under her feet . When she finished peeing , she pulled the flush handle while still sitting on the bowl and felt air whoosh up between her thighs . The ancient plumbing chortled as the water went down . She crossed back to the room where she and Eamon slept and climbed in beside him . He slept sprawled out when he 'd been drinking , a limb in each direction . She pushed the cold soles of her feet against his leg . He yelped and turned on his side . " Do you still love me ? " she whispered to his shoulder blade . The Guinness had receded , leaving her head trapped in an aching , sugary halo . She remembered the cartoons of men with sore heads , each one holding his pint of the black stuff . Language primers also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cinn pronounced like " sin " ? " Get some sleep , Beth . " He reached for her hand and held it hard against his hip . In the morning she found Eamon and Paddy downing tea in the living room . " It 's herself ! " Paddy announced . Eamon wore the green-andyellow cap that had been on the bush in the yard . He tossed her a Meath jersey . " I 'm not wearing this . " She threw it back at him and went to put on her own clothes . " You 'll look like an eejit in cashmere , " he warned . She had not showered in two days-a record for her . She sniffed her armpits . They smelled like the microwaved kasha she 'd gotten on the plane . She felt as if she were soggy grain , fermenting . DUBLIN bustled with pregame drunkenness , everyone spilling out of the pubs in their green-and-yellow jerseys . " This is a Meath pub , " Eamon said as he elbowed his way in . People rebounded off Beth , flecking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pints of Guinness she let Eamon help her pull the Meath jersey on over her sweater . " You look lovely , " he said , and kissed her , stuffing his tongue into her mouth . She trotted along behind him to the stadium . Their tickets were for an area called Hill Sixteen-a section with no seats , only low cement walls to lean on . " What if we get trampled ? " she shouted , but the cheering and roaring drowned her out . Mary Robinson came out dressed in purple silk , and everyone stood for the national anthem . They sang in Irishloose , lilting syllables that Beth could n't form . She still often made the mistake of walking into the men 's room , labeled FIR . Women 's was MNA , which she always transposed into MAN . Eamon shouted all the way through the match . Beth had trouble keeping track of the ball . Meath pulled ahead by a point in the last two minutes of the match . " Brilliant , " Eamon breathed . His eyes glinted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their hats threw themselves into the crowd below . Eamon was hugging the man beside him and weeping . " Jesus , Eamon . Pull yourself together . " Beth patted him on the back . She had never seen him weep before . It made her want to drink . They rode home with Siobhan and John Joe . The tradition , apparently , was to stop at pubs along the homeward route . Replays were being held in every hamlet , each moment of the game worked over in murderous detail . " Sure they won , but they played crap , " Siobhan said . The Guinness was starting to blur the edges of things . Beth was starting to like life better this way-everything bleeding together . " They played crap , " she agreed . From under a straw hat that seemed to be gradually unraveling on her head , Siobhan offered her a wavering , contentious look . Beth had been practicing her accent , the way she practiced Irish words and " poas . " Usually she practiced in her head . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushed together stuck in her throat , a halitosis of want , for after all , she was n't , would never be , Irish . " I did n't mean it like that , " she said . " Go get a round from the barman , " Eamon said . He pushed a roll of bank notes into her hand . While she was up at the bar , singing began-first in scattered clusters , then a chorus , then a ragged harmony . The crowd , surging up for drinks , pinned her against the bar . In the corner Siobhan put one arm around John Joe and the other around Eamon . A man with an accordion climbed up on a table and began to play with restless , fanatic energy . He lay down on his back , still playing , and gulped a pint of Guinness as it was poured into his mouth from above . OVER the next few weeks things began moving more and more slowly , as if drifting in the Liffey , rife with pollutants . Each night Beth and Eamon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a meal , usually dark-brown and stewed . Afterward they lingered for hours at the table with multiple cups of tea , any uneaten food congealing on the plates in front of them . Beth became convinced that the nightly pints of Guinness , as opaque and dense as oak , had gone solid in her body , shellacking her organs . Her limbs stiffened ; she had to mind them when she walked through doorways . Her Irish was n't coming along as she 'd expected . People spoke it in jest and secretly , muttering quickly , reminding her of drug transactions she 'd seen on the Lower East Side of Manhattan . It should be noted that the English language is weighted toward action , control , independence , she read in her primer . " I am happy . " " I am sad . " In contrast , the Irish language explicitly recognizes distinctions between action and patience . taim go bronach " I exist sadly . " ta bron ore " Sadness exists on me . " A stubborn clump of rain clouds gathered over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gray sheets of rain and sleet fell for days . The weather began dueling with the Gaelic football win as a topic of conversation , but no one seemed daunted by all the flichshneachta : women walked out for their groceries in it with little more cover than rain hats ; children tumbled on the greens with their soccer balls , oblivious even of downpours . Beth thought about sadness existing on her , a beige miasma , a misty blight . She felt her soul assailed , soaked through , retreating into its crawl space . The peat that Paddy brought in to burn in the fireplace steamed when he lit it . Even the food acquired a musty taste-musty cheese on stiff bread , flat Lucozade that Eamon and Paddy never capped tightly enough , so that it lost its fizz and tasted to Beth like glucose solution . At night she huddled in bed and warmed her hands on Eamon 's shoulders , a Girl Scout tending a tiny fire . " We ca n't stay here much longer , " she said . " Rent is due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wire it from here . " Outside , rain clacked against the windows . In the past few days the hills around the town had gone deep and then deeper green , a hegemony of green . " I want to go home , " she whispered . " Do you want to stay ? " They lay for a long time like that , her hands at his back . Then he got up and left the room , returning with a carton of milk . He gulped from it and handed it to her . It had started to sour , the first inkling of curdle . " It 's gone off , " she said , gagging a little as some of it slipped down her throat . He took the carton from her and lay back on his side of the bed . She heard the milk slosh into his mouth , a dumb sour ocean between them . " Then stay , " he said . " Then go .
