txt // quantity theory of money and of how well or how poorly one formulation or another of such theories fits the rest of the body of economic analysis that is our presently held approximation to a satisfactory explanation of economic phenomena . The theory is used here merely to discuss the significance of the caeteris paribus assumption in economics at a little greater length than is usual in the textbooks , both because of its general importance and because the usual explanation often leaves students with an insufficiently clear understanding of what its significance is . More than incidentally , it may be added here that much of what economists accept ( or scientists in other disciplines accept ) is a matter of how well a given theorem fits with the rest of what is currently generally accepted in the discipline . For often that is the best evidence we have of its likely validity . The above comments may also serve to shed some light upon the concept that economics is a discipline in which the test of a theory is its ability to predict . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assumptions in a theory is irrelevant if it predicts well . However , the test of how well it predicts is a matter of how well it would have predicted at certain times in the past . That is to say , the theory is formulated so that it fits data on the past , hence is one possible explanation of the past . There may be alternative theories that would equally well explain some of the past , that is , predict some part of it from a previous part of it . Some in the profession contend that the chances that one theory or another will have predictive value for the unknown future depend first upon the degree of realism of the assumptions on which the theory rests , and second upon how significant are the unpredictable changes that may occur in relationships that have held in the past . Much of the trouble we have been discussing arises , of course , out of the fortunate inability of the economist ( and social scientists generally ) to conduct the sort of scientifically controlled experiments that are sometimes possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not have to serve as guinea pigs for social science experiments designed to prove or disprove some hypotheses . Yet the fact remains that we need as much light as we can get on various theories about causal relationships among economic variables in order to know the most likely consequences of various economic policies which , from time to time , may be chosen in various circumstances . Choices have to he made on the basis of judgments about // various theories , despite lack of definitive proof about their validity in the past and certainly without proof about how well they may hold in the future . So theories are indispensable for action as well as for providing some understanding of events . A purely descriptive economics would only lead to questions as to what explains why things are as they are or were as they were . One can fill books with statistical data or other descriptive data , and they would be utterly boring to read unless accompanied by some effort at explanation , and anything offered as an explanation of anything is a theory . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theories , however troublesome and undefinitive the results . What we can do and need to do is try to formulate theories that start with as full as possible a recognition of the actual facts that need to be explained , rather than ignoring the degree of unreality of the theories that we spin to give us a simple model we might prefer to reason about . The actual behavior of markets , of business decision-makers , of household consumers , of workers , and others needs to be examined first-hand , along with the perceptions of decision-makers and their possibly complex set of motives . A lot of contemporary economics is study of the logical implications of models that are based on simplifying assumptions . Starting instead from extensive research into real behavior and relationships that there is some reason to expect will continue to hold at least in the near future should give a better basis for predictions , though at best our ability to predict the future is not going to be very great in the field of economics . There are too many ways that people can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made independent of the reactions to predictions . Some predictions , despite insufficient basis , can become self-fulfilling prophecies because of people 's reactions to the predictions . In other instances , even well-based predictions can lead to actions that prevent their becoming true , because people did not like what they foresaw and acted to make the future different . We do need , however , to try to ascertain the most likely effects of different actions . For this purpose , the more realistic the model , the more useful its logical implications are likely to be . 5 . The Production Possibilities Frontier Most economics principles textbooks display a production possibilities curve early in the hook , showing the maximum amount of some one ( conglomerate ) product ( such as food ) that it would be possible for the // economy to produce , given its resource base and technology , along with the maximum possible production of another product , again using all available resources , and all intermediate possibilities that divide the resources between the two ( conglomerate ) products . As stated , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be possible to have the entire economy use all its resources and confine itself to either such product . There are several important concepts that are or can be explained with the aid of the production possibilities frontier . They can be as well or better explained by envisaging a more realistic situation , starting from an existent allocation of resources among different lines of production , a sort of multidimensional production possibilities concept instead of a two-dimensional frontier , and with attention to the concept of using all of an economy 's resources . An economy is said to be technically efficient if its production lies somewhere on the production possibilities frontier . The frontier shows the available choices of efficient combinations of products , hence the opportunity costs and possible marginal trade-offs at any point on the frontier . Think now not of end points on a two-dimensional curve , but of producing some technically efficient real combination of outputs , represented by a set of points in n-dimensions . One can think then about various possible trade-offs ; increasing any one output will be at the expense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any one thing would have to be sacrificed to increase the output of something else is the opportunity cost ( the significant economic cost ) of that increased output in terms of the specific alternative sacrificed at that particular margin . There are thus numerous possible trade-offs at any existent margin , so expansion of one output has a range of specifiable opportunity costs . In connection with the production possibilities curve or elsewhere , textbooks usually introduce the principle of increasing opportunity costs . The more one increases the output of one thing at the expense of others , the higher the opportunity cost of the first . An economy is not technically efficient if it could produce more of some product without reducing production of another , a situation represented by points inside the production possibilities frontier , viewed multidimensionally or more simply . The existence of involuntarily unemployed labor would indicate that many lines of production could he expanded without decreasing production anywhere , provided the labor // was mobile skiliwise and geographically . Involuntarily unemployed labor , when it exists , is the most serious technical inefficiency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually implied by saying that the production possibilities frontier gives the maximum output possible by using all the economy 's resources , does not have the importance or even the meaning that full employment of labor has . The capacity of capital equipment is itself a rather loose concept . Ordinarily capital capacity , as usually measured , is built ahead of normal operating rates partly to facilitate steady output growth instead of growth being held at a fixed limit until a large lump of capacity can be added , which again would be underutilized for a time . In short , capacity grows by lumps instead of by small steady increments . And if existent capacity is pushed to its short-run limit , that may run into higher costs , and might involve overfull employment of labor to make it possible . The proper objective for an economy is not to do whatever is necessary with people to get maximum possible output from all capital equipment in existence at any given time . The equipment is there to facilitate full and productive employment of labor in a growing economy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be made of the concept of full utilization . So-called natural resources are themselves " produced " ; there is no fixed supply of them to be either fully utilized or left unused , with the implication that the former is involved in maximizing the output of the economy . Finally , a word about allocative efficiency in relation to the production possibilities frontier . The question of where to operate on the production possibilities frontier is a matter of allocative efficiency , not just technical efficiency . Allocative efficiency is a matter of getting the most highly valued combination of outputs on the frontier . This can lead to discussions of what determines the relative valuation of different output combinations , and discussion of how well an actual resource allocation coincides with an optimal set of points on the multidimensional production possibilities frontier . Some comments on the valuation problem will be made later . 6 . Wants , Resources , Technology , Productive Units Any economy can be analyzed in terms of people 's wants , the resources available to satisfy those wants , and the technology that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfied by available resources through the operation of productive organizations of one kind or another . That sounds quite simple , but it turns out that the three elements are not entirely independent of one another . Productive organizations now include corporations and other forms of businesses , households ( which produce many human wants that do not go through a market to be bought and sold ) , and many other social organizations that may or may not operate in part through buying and selling . Many of these productive units not only produce goods and services in response to known wants , but they make efforts to influence people to want what they produce . And the technology available is itself a product of efforts to develop better ways of producing whatever is produced . Even an economic resource depends in part on the technology . Oil was not a productive resource at one time until a technology was developed to use it as a major source of energy . Years ago economics textbooks started with chapters on productive resources , usually classified as land , labor , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uniform resource : people . Capital referred to machinery and factories and the like . Resources included not just potentially arable land , but all the usable natural resources as well , whether on the surface or buried beneath it . Assuming technically efficient use of resources and the technology , the economic problem was how to produce from them the greatest value . The problem was to get the best resource allocation . with the operation of the extractive " industries . " The problems associated with the industries that are trying to get the natural resources nickel , copper , coal , and so on ? in the needed usable form and quantity are not studied separately from those businesses making products from those resources . Indeed the single most important sector of the economy dealing with a resource is agriculture , the source of food and fiber . There is an old saying that " an army travels on its stomach " but so do we all . There is nothing so important for life as food . And in this country , ever since World War I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because many farmers have faced problems that were somewhat unique to their " line of business . " Even today economics textbooks usually confine their treatment of agriculture and farm problems to a chapter that // points out , correctly , that if public policy supports farm prices above market-determined levels , agricultural surpluses will become a problem . Farmers ' problems over the years here or elsewhere can not be dealt with adequately in this short book , but a few comments can be made to guide readers . Worldwide agriculture takes many forms . Many farmers barely make a living as " subsistence farmers " on their small plots with primitive technology . They grow what they eat , and they eat what they grow . With any difficulty they are forced to borrow money at usurious rates from moneylenders who often keep the farmers in debt for the rest of their lives . Many other farmers till the soil for large landowners , and may also barely subsist , while the landowner usually does much better . Semifeudal conditions still exist . American farmers have done much better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with technological improvements ( in machinery , soil conservation efforts , and improved seed and fertilizer ) that raised farm productivity as fast as productivity grew in much of manufacturing . But in both world wars , production expanded to meet wartime demands , which fell after the wars and lowered farm prices , to the detriment of farmers . Government support of some farm product prices ( especially grains ) helped large commercial farmers but did not solve problems identified as farm poverty , difficulties of the family farms , natural disasters and bad years , instability of farm prices , or the worsening of prices the farmer pays relative to the prices he receives for what he can sell . Not all proposals to deal with these other problems made sense , but few were adopted , and there is an ongoing need to see whether the problems can be dealt with better . There is no more important sector of any economy than its agricultural sector . More attention needs to be paid to its problems . When we consider economic resources more fully , we need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latter , which are part of our economy 's resource base , are being depleted today at a historically unprecedented rate . That is beginning to be discussed , and will be treated briefly in this book in essay 37 . In the same essay there will be a discussion of the fact that the renewable resources are also being overused , so that even our lifesupport system is being overloaded . Both types of resources are also being polluted , which raises the costs of using them when they can still be used at all . And although these problems are presently being created // primarily by the industrial economies of the world , if the less developed economies succeed in escaping their poverty traps and come into the industrial world , the prospect is frightening because their huge and growing populations will worsen all these problems tremendously . Yet the answer is not for them to remain poverty-stricken nor for industrial countries to again become underdeveloped . However , economics is again paying some attention to its resource base and its life-support system , yet this time not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it is in trouble . Economizing and Rationality 7 . The Economic Principle There is only one microeconomic principle , and that may be called the principle of marginalism . A major part of microeconomic analysis is devoted merely to applications of the principle . The principle is often stated differently in different applications . If dealing with consumer expenditure decisions , the formulation may be as follows : To maximize utility , allocate expenditures so as to equalize the marginal utilities of the last dollar spent in each available line of expenditure . Or to make an efficient allocation of a productive resource , allocate the resource so that its marginal productivity in all possible uses is the same . Or to maximize profits , carry production to the point where marginal revenues and marginal costs are equal . In a more general formulation it would be : Continue any activity to the point where marginal gain and marginal cost are equal if one is trying to maximize net gain . Of course , it can be argued that the last unit of activity that equalizes the two adds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formulated in terms of inequalities , not equalities , and continue only so long as marginal gain exceeds marginal cost ; and the principle is sometimes formulated in such manner . Marginal costs are merely additions to total cost , and marginal gains are additions to total gains , from carrying something one unit farther . Although some applications may not be obvious , and the effort may be to make it appear abstruse and difficult , as by inflicting calculus upon the uninitiated , it is reducible not simply to common sense but to simple arithmetic . The principle states merely that a total increases if one adds more to it than one subtracts from it . So do not let microeconomic // maximizations throw you . Examine carefully to see whether a statement formulates the principle accurately so that it reduces to simple arithmetic , and if necessary reformulate it so that is the case , but you need not be intimidated by marginal analysis , important , fundamental , and widely applicable as it is . But how widely applicable is the economic principle of marginalism ? Decisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one can not argue with the arithmetic involved . But it can be and has been objected that it is not descriptive of how people make decisions . It is prescriptive , not descriptive . If one wants to maximize something , that being the end , and the means ( resources ) being limited , apply the principle , for that is the only way to succeed ; it is the only rational way to maximize something . It rationally relates means to that end . The economist takes utility maximization , maximization of the satisfaction of whatever wants people have , as the ultimate objective of people . And the principle has such a prominent place in market analysis , not because people rationally maximize want satisfaction all the time , but because it is a necessary part of the explanation of market behavior . Another way of stating the matter is to say that the principle tells how to economize scarce resources , and people do economize enough that the market can not be adequately explained without giving such economizing an important role . In discussing definitions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the applicability of the economic principle ; that brief discussion should be reviewed here . It concluded that all life is not reducible to an economic problem . But does this mean that rationality is limited to choices of means , and is not applicable to choices of ends and objectives in life ? Are values essentially matters of taste and is wisdom irrelevant in their choice ? This opens up a deeper question for philosophy , and instead of suggesting how reason might be applied to value choices , the economist is more likely to leave an impression that no philosophical position has been taken in the economic discussion , when one may have been implied by or inferred from the textbook . The next section will return to the topic of want satisfaction , maximization , and rationality in a broader context . 8 . The Dehumanized Utility Function and Rationality The consumer is said to allocate his income rationally among lines of expenditure according to the marginal principle so as to maximize his // satisfaction . But individuals are often in no position to really know what would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implies knowledge that is not really possible , according to Herbert Simon.3 So consumer analysis is unrealistic from the beginning . However , let us examine it in further respects . To simplify economic analysis , certainly not to explain reality , the utility functions of individuals , as described in the textbooks , usually explicitly exclude any elements involving the utilities or disutilities of other individuals . Economists picture society as a collection of atomistic individuals who interact in markets and actually make economic decisions with neither beneficent nor sadistic impulses . One would think that at least the concept of " keeping up with the Joneses " would need to be recognized in analysis of economic behavior , and indeed it may be mentioned somewhere , but not when talking about the utility function where it is clearly relevant . The perverse preference of envy destroys the nice utility maximizing outcome of the market game . But why gum up and complicate a nice simple analysis of how atomistic individuals might behave even if that would be quite different from the way humans actually behave ? We might better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complicated . Without conceding that psychology has a very good picture or explanation of individual or group human behavior , surely economics is relying upon a misleading abstraction from reality in its assumptions as to human behavior in the economic realm . We do n't use the term " economic man " as we used to , but it is the term that has fallen into disuse , not the assumptions . People are treated as though they rationally maximized individual want satisfaction ( utility ) independently of other people , and it is assumed that this is only rational self-interest , and anything other than self-interest is nonexistent as well as irrational . It is , of course , possible to treat formally every action as dictated by pure self-interest . Even what people ordinarily call unselfishness can be treated as doing just what one wanted to do , and therefore selfish . But then we need different words to distinguish the actions that are clearly dictated without reference to others , actions even deliberately against the interest of others , and actions evidently designed to benefit others . Hopefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one gave a damn about other members and completely ignored them in all decisions made . Since that is humanly impossible , it is safe to say that no economist had such bad luck . But then what is ordinarily // considered humane and inhumane motivation might somehow be recognized along with narrowly self-interested motives and actions in economic analysis of the actual world , and models excluding them be seen for what they are , models of a different and far from ideal world . Indeed it would be realistic to say that the most important element in anyone 's utility function would not lie in the area of consumption but in relations with other people , family and friends obviously , but also in the so-called economic world in the quality of relations with fellow workers and supervisors on the job . Indeed the economist seems to build models in which all behavior is rational in a very narrow sense . The only partial excuse for this is that there seems to be enough rationality that it needs to be taken into account in order to explain actual market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rational " means to the economist is that individuals act intelligently ( efficiently ) in their own self-interest . One might speculate on how much better off people would be nowadays if only we did act in our own self-interest more of the time . And it is clear from common experience that the extensive failures to do so are not explicable simply in terms of force and fraud . People often know better and still do not act in their own self-interest . Irrational , yes . It is the irrationality that the whole segment of the economy involved in advertising , and much salesmanship , depends upon and promotes . The economist 's pure self-interest model is not realistic . People do not really try to maximize anything that could be termed self-interest in either a narrow or a broad sense , though they clearly would be better off if they did . That is , if they quit doing things that are hurtful to them they would be very much better off . But there are problems with narrow self-interest that still need to be addressed here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a narrow sense with rationality does not itself have some antisocial consequences . If it does , is not the economist to blame ? Has he not equated maximizing utility and maximizing profit with rational self-interest ? Perhaps he has had too much influence on our culture . Or is the economist merely borrowing the cultural ideology , and at most reinforcing it . Is it not the case that people generally do , in this culture , take a rather narrowly defined conception of self-interest to be the only thing rational , and hence self-justifying ? And does this not hinder recognition of the extent to which that can produce consequences that not only harm others but boomerang and are self-defeating ? Especially // since the greatest disutilities for any of us lie in suffering that others may cause us , and our greatest satisfactions come from mutuality , not only in free contract but on the emotional level in relations with other people . All this suffers when it is considered smart to get the maximum one can out of every opportunity , and to give as little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But in fact such an attitude in life subverts all human relationships . If people treated each other thus , it would wreck any marriage and even any friendship . And in terms of productivity with which the economist is directly concerned , the attitude is the opposite of the work ethic and constitutes a very serious drain on productivity . Can the economist 's analysis not incorporate all this instead of incorporating and thus aiding and abetting a false notion of rational self-interest that has antisocial consequences ? It would not really corrupt economic analysis if self-interest were to be more realistically defined in terms of what sociologists have called the social self . The actual self-interest that we pursue includes the well-being of at least family and friends , for anyone not inhumanly narcissistic . And when people speak of " we " in different contexts , it may refer to some group to which the person belongs and is concerned about , a group the individual is proud to be a member of , resents slurs against , and tries to promote the well-being of and the objectives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about and try to promote the interests of the business class in general , and do so on ideological grounds even at some cost , as much as for any indirect gain to their individual person . In an age of nationalism , the social self typically includes the nation as such . The self in the narrower self may even be sacrificed to the nation , although in general the further one goes from the narrow self in the more inclusive social self , from closer primary ties to ever looser secondary relations , the less concern there is for those less close and the less strongly their well-being enters the individual 's utility function . On the other side of the matter , insofar as our personal dislikes go as to enjoy seeing some persons ' misfortunes , those feelings are also parts of our utility functions . Society , and each of us individually , has an interest in social restraints on actions based on people 's satisfaction in hurting others . In the broad sense , self-interest is a matter of what people value and devalue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a person values is in that individual 's self-interest and increases its total // utility , if that word is to be used in an adequate sense . Values include things that are ordinarily called ideological and personal as well as what are ordinarily called economic , and since the last of these are often not the most important , an analysis that includes explicitly only the last is quite unrealistic and misleading , as well as possibly having some antisocial consequences . Indeed community depends on a substantial sharing of values . Consumption provides utilities , work is a matter of disutility , and rationality limits the latter to what is necessary for the former , according to classical economic doctrine . Practically speaking , there are narrow limits to the possibility in our economy of choosing our work week . But anyone knows that although disutility in work is often all too real , life without work is not a great ideal either in terms of the sort of people it produces . And practically as well as ideally , much satisfaction can often be obtained in work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment , and assume that he and she take into account all actual net utilities as considered above and applies marginal analysis in making decisions . At best this would be prescriptive counsel , not descriptive of how people actually behave . If taken as descriptive , how could it be validated or disproven ? Anything people do can be said to be in accordance with their self-interest , their maximization of utility . Thus the proposition becomes essentially tautological . So some economists give up on utility and talk only of revealed preferences . But unless one has given up on rationality as well , and on all that follows from assuming it , one is no better off . If one gives up both utility and rationality , one has thrown out the baby with the bathwater , given up all microeconomic explanation of human behavior , given up both descriptive and prescriptive microeconomics of it . How much better it would be to try to do a decent job of both , even though that would be less simple than that to which economics has reduced it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruled by our emotions , and that reason merely rationalizes and serves the emotions . There is ample evidence for this point of view . Clearly , advertising operates not by informing us but by playing on the emotions . So the economic system can not claim efficient satisfaction of human wants ; it endeavors to create the wants it satisfies . It treats human beings like Pavlov 's dog . The essence of immorality is treating others not as ends // but as means to one 's own benefit . Much advertising has much to answer for , especially advertising to the immature . Fortunately , most adults have at least some degree of natural skepticism of advertising claims , so they can not be brainwashed completely , though there is evidence that they are also affected by it to some extent . The subject of people 's emotional life is a big subject , not one to be treated here . But economics needs to take it into account when it is trying to be a descriptive and explanatory as well as a prescriptive science . Most people are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and by a conception of responsibility , by a notion of the sort of good person they want to be , and are not simply amoral or immoral to a larger degree . They take satisfaction in such motivation and in action consistent with it , and in shared values . The importance of all this in the utility function is hard to overestimate , for it provides the moral basis upon which the economy depends . That it is not a strong enough basis is all too obvious , but if it were quite nonexistent , as implied by the above discussion of the " smart guy " ethic , life could be reduced to a Hobbesian world , mean , nasty , brutish , and short . So our utility function is much different from that typically pictured in economics . It includes work , play , and consumption , it includes moral values and other values , ideological commitments and care about what happens to other people . Call it all self-interest if you insist , but pay attention to the large differences in the character of behavior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to whether all the different sources of utility ( satisfaction ) are sufficiently alike in quality that they are additive , as implied in the economist 's treatment of utility maximization . Sociologist Amitai Etzioni says , " Moral acts are a source of value other than pleasure . Indeed , many are explicitly based on denial of pleasure in the name of the principle(s) involved . " 4 He insists that a taste for honesty is not on a par with a taste for peanut butter . The issue should not be simply disposed of Neither will it be pursued further here except to make a suggestion that an alternative to additivity of all utilities be considered . Insofar as there may be warrant for considering some satisfactions as somewhat noncomparable and nonadditive , perhaps we should consider the concept of better and worse balances among such qualitatively different types of satisfactions . Would this create a problem for the usual indifference curve analysis , or could it readily accommodate the balance concept ? // 9 . Human Ends Economics assumes that the economic man is an atomistic individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that merely serves them . As such it avoids inquiring into human ends and so can not really conclude , as it does , how well it serves them . For such conclusions it really needs a psychology of human needs . Abraham Maslow 's writings provide a good account of human nature . He envisages a hierarchy of needs , starting at the bottom with what he calls deficiency needs : physiological needs such as air , water , food , shelter . Above that in the hierarchy are psychological and social needs such as self-esteem , esteem by others , belongingness , affection , and acceptance . At the top of the hierarchy are moral needs : love , truth , service , justice , perfection , esthetics , meaningfulness.5 There is the proposition that reason is only instrumental and can not serve in the choice of human values , ends , and purposes . That might be defended if life were not better than death , and if health were not preferable to ill health . But given those two propositions , there is an objective basis for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know all we need to know about what diets are relatively healthful and which are less so . But they do know something about it , and it is not just a matter of subjective preferences . We know that there are conditions that determine the healthfulness of diets , and that we are better off the better we harmonize with these conditions . The same may be said about other aspects of human life . We need to harmonize our conflicting impulses and emotions for our own wholesomeness and health . We need to develop and harmonize our creative potentials with those of other people , or conflicts and suffering may result . Groups of people need to do likewise . And for our economies to be sustainable , we need to harmonize their activities with those of the natural world . It will be self-defeating to harm our life-support system , and it is high time to count depletion of our natural capital as such instead of counting it as income . Although we are still struggling to know all we need to know about human nature , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . We also know that there is not one straight and narrow way that alone will do , but that there are many patterns of life that will work and bring us the maximum benefits . We can also fall short of that in an infinite number of ways , and indeed can make a mess of life instead . // We all know that there is a duality in life 's impulses , a nobler and a more debased element , and that we need to cultivate the one and not the other . We all have a conscience , and know guilt when we do not listen to it . Our materialism needs to give way to the old virtues such as prudence , justice , fortitude , and temperance , according to E.F . Schumacher in Small Is Beautiful.6 Virtuous character is still a proper end of humanity . We need a science that treats people as holistic individuals with a structure of human needs and an inborn potential for higher levels of living and more meaningful lives , and we need a culture and polity that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impoverished . The good society is one that encourages us in the right directions , that provides the opportunities that everyone needs for personal fulfillment in conjunction with others . The good society promotes community values and the welfare of its members , welfare from biological to cultural , from working conditions to living conditions and consumption . Such sentiments are expressed well by John Hobson in an excellent old book called Work and Wealth. ? The good society grants everyone the right to fair and ample opportunities to develop and harmonize their fine potentialities , and it discourages antisocial activities . It promotes human betterment . The concept of a good society is as old as that of the good life . Both imply an ethical criterion . This vastly transcends simple want satisfaction . Economics separated itself from its ethical and religious roots after the medieval period . Adam Smith was a professor of moral philosophy , though few students today read his Theory of Moral Sentiments in which his conception of human nature is spelled out more fully than in An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political economy . Modern economics has also ceased to be explicitly political , although there is no shortage of explicit political conclusions drawn from its supposedly purely economic analyses . 10 . Individual and Social Decision-Making Economics treats the economy as though it were separate from society , whereas it should be treated as a subsystem of society , polity , and culture . Human preferences are not determined individually but socially . They continually form and reform as people engage in eco36 HARLAN M. SMITH nomic activity , according to MIT economist Lester Thurow.9 The decisions are often large and irreversible , not the small reversible ones assumed by economics . The desire for power is left out of the analysis , yet people struggle for wealth , which is for power , not for future consumption . ' ? Bruno Frey , in Economics as a Science of Human Behavior , says that collectives are not decision-makers , but then contends that , at any point in time , human behavior is determined by organizations : the state , interest groups , firms , clubs , families , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and laws . And for the society , there are four decision-making systems : pricing in a market system , democracy , hierarchy , and bargaining . " 1 So , are individual actions and social policy governed by ideas , interests , values , emotions , reason , tradition , or culture ? Yes , and it is not easy to sort out the relative importance of each with respect to different types of decisions and actions , but it is necessary to make the effort better than does orthodox economics . As Herbert Simon argues , the type of rationality assumed by economists is literally impossible.12 Yet orthodox economics has been influential . Witness the famous passage from the General Theory of Employment , Interest and Money by John Maynard Keynes : " The ideas of economists and political philosophers , both when they are right and when they are wrong , are more powerful than is commonly understood . Indeed the world is ruled by little else . . . . I am sure that the power of vested interests is vastly exaggerated compared with the gradual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argues the contrary.14 He contends that ideas do not rule the world , that passions do . He says that readers and listeners are quite fallible in understanding what they read or hear ; they do n't get it right . But I contend that , whether right or wrong , it is passionately held ideas that matter and that guide human behavior . And that for the most part these are ideas that are floating around in the culture or are even drummed into us by the subcultures in which we find ourselves . Demand , Supply , Competition , Invisible Hand 11 . Price Determination Students easily get the impression that the economist 's answer to any question is " demand and supply . " That is the answer usually given to the question of what determines individual prices . What really completes the answer is , of course , the analysis of what lies behind and determines both demand and supply conditions for different things priced . Some students may feel there is an elementary difficulty with the demand-and-supply story in that it is stated as though the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be changed by changes in demand or supply . Of course , prices are set and changed by people as a result of decision-making processes in which people respond to some degree to what they perceive , rightly or wrongly , to be changes in some of the conditions that affect demands and supplies . A human role is recognized in the term " price-makers , " though the term " price-takers " seems to suggest absence of human intervention . It is explained that in the latter situation , an individual seller or buyer can not effectively bargain over price since there are other buyers and sellers ready to complete transactions at a price that has been prevailing in the market . Older textbooks used to illustrate situations in which buyers and sellers could haggle and bargain over price within a range set by what each one was willing to do . In the imaginary perfectly competitive market situation , each side knows , or learns by experience , that the range shrinks to a single price . Apart from the two conditions just mentioned , bargaining and perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to buy at prices others have set . And the sellers , who are the price-makers ( as the term goes , or price-searchers as others would call them ) , make decisions about prices to charge , based upon their estimates of demand and supply conditions . Presumably they learn by experience that , for any given demand and supply conditions , although they have power to vary price , there is only one price that will maximize their profits . That is how demand and supply , the latter usually implying cost conditions , determine price , not by magic but by human decisions as to prices . Of course , the textbook is talking primarily about equilibrium prices , those that equate quantity demanded and quantity supplied , not primarily about the market prices at any specific time when they may not be at an equilibrium . But even though all prices involve someone 's setting them according to some perceived conditions , even the monopolist seems " forced " to set the price that market and cost conditions dictate if the objective is profit maximization . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or oligopolized market than in a perfectly competitive one . Perhaps they will be higher . But what the textbooks show is that if a perfectly competitive market were to have the innumerable firms collude somehow , or be combined somehow , so that the result was pricing decisions made in terms of a perceived downward sloping demand curve , the resulting prices would be higher than in the perfectly competitive market . It does not follow , however , that any market dominated by a monopoly or oligopoly would have lower prices if the firms were broken up into such small noncolluding units that the market became perfectly competitive . The fact of the matter is that although monopoly or oligopoly may result from collusion or combination , it may also result in or from economies of scale . And to the extent that such economies of scale are present , breaking up productive units into smaller ones would result in higher average costs and higher market prices , not lower prices . The usual propositions about output and misallocation of resources from monopoly and oligopoly are to be thrown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is obvious in the case of natural monopoly , but sometimes it is not made clear that the possible applicability of scale economies is broader . To he sure , big business structures can not all be explained as due simply and solely to scale economies . It seems strange that a firm throwing one more unit of output upon a // monopolized market must reduce price to sell it , while if there were many competitors in the market any one firm could sell another unit in the market without lowering the price . The clue to this puzzle is that the analysis assumes that the perfectly competitive market demand is huge relative to the total output of any individual firm , so an added unit of output has a negligible price effect , while for the monopoly , the size of a unit of output of the firm is large relative to the market demand . Thus an output larger than before by one such unit is salable only at a slightly lower price , as indicated by a downward sloping market-demand curve . It is all a matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the total market demand at a given price . Where there is some degree of market power ( monopoly power ) , a common pricing method is to add some customary markup to costs . This or other such " rules of thumb " may not maximize profits , but is common in the absence of adequate information about marginal costs and marginal revenues . Textbooks generally provide discussions of other pricing methods , including price leadership and the kinked demand curve case , and bargaining . Then , of course , attention should be paid to the various ways in which prices are influenced by government : setting some price minimums and maximums , regulating utility rates , and the like . A further word is in order here about bargaining power and prices in markets where the amount of competition on the two sides of the market is unequal . It is common knowledge that in labor markets the price paid to hire labor may be much less than would have to be paid were the competition for labor greater than the competition for jobs . This is very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to improve the bargaining power of some groups of laborers . Clearly the common disparities in bargaining power in labor markets implies the absence of perfect competition , an absence not originating with unionism . Textbooks seldom make all this clear , though job seekers usually find that no single employer needs them as badly as they need a job . Some textbooks mention the concept of consumers ' surplus . They talk nonsense when a demand curve is extended back to the vertical axis , as though it had any real meaning there . What we really know about demand-and-supply curves for anything is confined to a very narrow range of prices and quantities , and even that may be gummed up because the observations may include shifts of either or both curves . Of course , there is no harm in extending these curves some40 HARLAN M. SMITH what because there is good reason to suppose that they have the same shapes beyond the observed ranges . However , it is not sensible to extend the curves the whole way back to the vertical axis . We never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if there was only a single unit of the product produced , even one per unit of time . It was nonsense to suppose that one could measure a consumers ' surplus under a demand curve drawn clear back to the vertical axis . ( Similarly for supply : It is not realistic to assume that a firm would produce a single unit of something at the price shown by extending the supply curve back to the vertical axis . ) Let us review a bit the analysis of price and output determination by a normal downward sloping supply curve and a normal upward sloping supply curve . Is this the general case as we may suppose , or when does it not suffice ? Let us recognize first that in reality there is no empirical evidence of what demand or supply quantities would be outside of a relatively small range , and even within this range , either demand or supply may have changed to give the observed result . Of course , we think we are warranted in extending the curves somewhat beyond an observed range . The firm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand curve but has a horizontal demand curve . The normal demand-and-supply curves may be applicable to a perfectly competitive industry in the short run . In the long run its supply curve might be expected to be horizontal . For a monopoly , the demand curve has the normal shape , but it has no normal supply curve as a simple function of price . The quantity supplied is determined not by price but by the position and shape of the marginal revenue curve . For monopoly , both price and quantity are dependent variables , though the cost conditions and the demand conditions are often treated as independent variables . That ceases to be the case when advertising has any effect on the demand curve as well as on costs . Most firms are neither perfectly competitive nor absolute or natural monopolies , but most have downward sloping demand curves influenced by advertising and hence no simple supply curves as functions of price . If one defines an industry composed of such firms , both its price and the quantity supplied are the result of guesses by member firms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost with what advertising outlay . Price is not an independent variable with quantities demanded and supplies dependent , nor are demand-and-supply // conditions entirely independent of each other . The further complication is that in reality we generally need to talk about multiple-product firms , some things being joint products . Cost curves for individual products are often hard to know accurately . Oligopolies introduce another complication to the demand curves . They still slope downward , but the position of a firm 's demand curve depends on the reactions expected by other firms to any strategy by any oligopolist . Demand is represented not by a single demand curve but at least by a complex matrix . Those simple downward sloping demand curves and upward sloping supply curves , drawn with price as an independent variable and quantities as the dependent variables , seem not to be very widely explanatory after all . Prices and quantities demanded and supplied by firms or industries are much more complicated dependent variables , especially when the determining variables are somewhat interdependent . When economics is realistic , it is not simple . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of explaining whether some change produces one result rather than another is to say simply that it depends on some elasticities , usually of demand and supply . They provide a formula for computing elasticities if one has the necessary data on how much people respond to a change in some price or income . Then they show that the outcome of a postulated change will be one thing , given one elasticity , and how it will differ if the elasticity is sufficiently different . The outcome of a price change , in terms of total expenditure on a product , may be shown to be different , not just in degree but in direction , if the demand elasticity is greater than one instead of less than one . This seems to have made a big contribution to our understanding , but in fact , if no knowledge has been provided as to what the elasticity is in a given situation , it has merely told us that we do n't know anything about the outcome . It has dodged the issue rather than having explained something , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determines the outcome of an action . But one has only given a name to something , not a real explanation of what will happen if a price changes . To say that the outcome of some change in a situation depends upon elasticities is merely to say that it depends upon // how much people respond to that change . Of course it does . But the economist has not added to our knowledge of the outcome unless there is knowledge given or available as to how much that response is going to be or is likely to be for the matter in question . One has not learned as much as one may think if one has merely learned that outcomes depend upon the unknown magnitudes of responses , even though one has learned how to compute numerical values for the concept . If one knows the elasticity in some case , it does not refer to a causal factor that explains people 's behavior ; it is only a convenient shorthand name for the amount of behavior response . 13 . Market Prices and Social Values A basic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properly . Market prices are in a sense social valuations , reflective of people 's demands and the relative scarcities of the resources required to respond to those demands . Economists critical of government-controlled prices speak of competitive market prices as scarcity prices , implying that they represent true social valuations . Then they admit that some social valuations are not adequately represented in even perfectly competitive markets , let alone in actual markets . What are called " externalities " are admittedly not registered in markets . These include the values of what are termed " public goods . " Of course , all sorts of social benefits and costs are external to the producing firms . There is the old quip that some people know the price of everything but the value of nothing . Living should tell anyone that there are many values in life that the market does not register at all or registers wrongly . Therefore in individual lives and in social policy we not only should , but actually must , second-guess the market on some relative values . So it is not being objective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social values . To be sure , the search for standards of social value is a baffling task , but a very important and necessary one . There is no yardstick as simple as dollar prices . But there is no real basis for objecting to doing something to alter the resource allocation that the market would give us if we really could and did follow that alone . Of course , a case has to be made to alter the resource allocations that market prices would yield , and we do so quite readily in some areas . For example , we make some activities illegal rather than letting // them be promoted by the values that the market would put on them . We even deliberately tax some things to reduce use , and we subsidize other things because we judge the market valuation to be erroneous and not in the social interest . Despite all the virtues economists legitimately allege for a market system and market pricing , there is ample room and reason for social policy to second-guess the market in some instances where a case can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Economists who try to have the last word on the matter by alleging an objective basis for criticizing any departure from market pricing are on unsound ground . To approve of market valuations entirely would imply approving of a situation where some people work full-time and still are in poverty , and few people really approve of that . In addition , if market valuations alone were to determine resource allocation , there would be no government services . All roads would be toll roads , there would be no national defense , only private police and fire departments , and justice would be paid for through private courts . Anarchism , real libertarianism , would prevail . Indeed if market prices were to represent all social values in any fashion , let alone properly , all private activities that now do not go through the market would have to do so and be bought and sold . We would have to buy and sell spouses and children . All volunteer activity would have to be bought and sold . Everything people did would have to involve buying and selling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undesirable , and even impossible . But it tells us clearly that the markets ' pricing is only a subset of the set of social values , and not always an accurate subset at that . Virtuous or creative persons have no market price , but their social value is great . The case rests . Market prices are very useful indeed , but they simply can not properly represent all social values , and so there is always room to secondguess market prices in terms of a set of social values . The further problem is that people 's notions differ as to what are proper social valuations . That is so even in relatively homogeneous cultures , let alone in cases of cultural pluralism and heterogeneity . It can be argued that market prices are as far as we can go , practically speaking . But that is not true because substantial majorities would be found on some issues , as for instance the failure of markets to price properly the services of the working poor . Indeed a substantial majority are not anarchists and do not want services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market pricing of them . Whenever there is enough public sentiment for interference with market prices , it is clear that social values differ from market prices . Economists should take note , not argue that it is all a mistake or uneconomic or inefficient . The final relevant argument will be discussed further later , but needs to be mentioned here before we go on . Prices are obviously affected by demand , and the demand of everyone is not equal ? when incomes are highly unequal , some people stuff the ballot box in voting for what they want resources used for . The market says it is efficient to provide luxuries for the rich , but sometimes not efficient to meet the more urgent needs of the poor . 14 . The Perfect Competition Norm The textbook treatments of markets usually begin with the assumption that they are perfectly competitive and work out a perfectly competitive equilibrium . The assumption is not in accord with the facts , since oligopolies dominate , and we are not dealing with a closed determinate mechanical system . Our actual observations are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationships makes the course of economic affairs a limitless and often unique series of historical facts.ls Yet one might well gather from many an economic principles textbook that perfect competition is a sort of norm , which might be taken to imply that any departures from perfect competition are generally unfortunate . Indeed the case is made for a perfectly competitive market structure as a norm by analyses purporting to show that it alone provides maximum allocative efficiency . It is also said to guarantee what may be called technical or productive efficiency because the inefficient firms would have higher costs and would fail . All this might be taken as providing the rationale for measures such as antitrust legislation to enforce competition , although at most they only place limits on some moves " too far " away from the norm , except of course in the case of natural monopoly that has to be accepted . Actually the case for maintaining rather highly competitive structures and practices does not depend upon whether perfect competition is a proper norm or not . The suggestion here is that perfect competition should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analysis that demonstrates the efficiency of perfect competition in equilibrium in a static model is // logically correct . But the model abstracts from some human considerations that are important in the actual world . Perfect competition does not overcome the difficulty already noted in connection with price determination that even competitive prices are not always correctly representative of social value , so if a norm it would be subject to such major qualifications and shortcomings . There is such a thing as excessive or cutthroat competition , and though that is usually associated with oligopoly , the more real the competition the greater the pressure to lower costs , and lowering costs may drive a whole industry to sacrifice product quality , working conditions , and the environment . According to the standard analysis of perfect competition , its return on capital tends toward the minimum necessary to obtain and keep the capital in each such perfectly competitive industry . Practically speaking , that means that the funds for research and development upon which we depend for much technological change and other innovations would be zero . Besides , whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real world of rather rapid economic change , we are virtually never in equilibrium but are constantly chasing the ever moving equilibrium targets . Rapid change requires a high degree of mobility of resources , including labor , especially if the economy is a perfectly competitive one . Whatever may be said about substantial short-run skill mobility , people do not thrive , nor do social conditions improve , with a high degree of geographical mobility of labor . Indeed the areas in our cities that display the most human mobility to keep up with economic change requirements have the highest rates of personal and social disorganization . Human beings need community roots , not perfect mobility . As for skill mobility , it is unrealistic to expect it to be very rapid for many people ; besides which , so much economic insecurity and dumping of people on scrap heaps if they do n't or ca n't retool upon demand is undesirable . This sounds like a case against too rapid change , and it is ; but it is not a case for a cartelized economy . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is humanly harsher than a more moderated degree of competition , for which a better case can be made . There may be some other aspects of the concept that are not normative that may be discussed along with questions of possibility and even conceivability . There is the question of whether perfect competition as a concept makes sense for an industry and for an economy , and whether it is // even possible . It seems such a simple concept and is so useful for pedagogical purposes , but one needs to examine the list of conditions that are stated as defining perfect competition . Some of them raise no problems of possibility or conceptual sense . For example , it is not too unrealistic or too difficult to imagine a situation for an industry ( but not for every part of the whole economy ) in which the numbers of buyers and sellers are both so large that each is likely as a practical matter to perceive its own influence on the market price to be negligible . But in fact there are economies of scale in some lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small relative to market demand . ( There are even what are called natural monopolies . ) So in this respect , at least , a perfectly competitive economy is impossible . There could be no equilibrium where such economies were not realized if they were possible . But moreover , it would not be better to avoid those scale economies rather than take advantage of them , so perfect competition would not be normative , as well as not providing a possible equilibrium . Another requirement for perfect competition is product homogeneity in each industry . Can it be argued that it would be possible ? It certainly would not be considered desirable to have so much standardization as to eliminate all product differentiation . Can you imagine each product variation to have so many producers and consumers that none could expect to influence price at all ? Perhaps substitutability among differentiated products would be enough for that result , but do we not then have a type of monopolistic competition rather than meeting the efficiency norm claimed for perfect competition ? Perfect competition involves perfect price flexibility , another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fixed debts . Would everything work so well if none were fixed ? What would then prevent more severe cumulative spirals up or down in price levels than we have had ? And if some prices , debts , and contracts are fixed , while current prices are completely flexible , real price deflation can be absolutely ruinous , bankrupting many otherwise sound economic operations . The argument does not call for complete price rigidity , it calls for more sophistication about the possibility and desirability of partial or total perfect price flexibility . Perfect competition is ordinarily conceived as entailing free entry and exit from any industry , " free " meaning completely unrestricted entry and exit , without any obstacle thereto . Is it really conceivable // that this could be the case for firms that require tremendous investments in real capital as well as money capital ? Or is the norm supposed to be an economy in which scale economies stop before such scale is reached ? And what about the possibility of perfect resource mobility in a world of fairly rapid change ? We can at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have already argued its undesirability , and have suggested the undesirability as well as impossibility of perfect short-run skill mobility . And although liquid capital can be about as mobile as one can conceive , disinvestment of embodied productive capital is almost always very slow and indeed sometimes impossible . There is zero mobility of some embodied capital when change prevents one from getting some of one 's money capital out and inflicts a real capital loss . Finally , there is the matter of the degree of knowledge assumed to be required for perfect competition to do all that is claimed for it in the model . All market participants are , in the typical model , assumed to have complete and correct information about everything relevant to their economic decisions . That would be a difficult condition to meet even in a static model , and when one thinks of what is entailed in a dynamic situation , the condition is clearly impossible to meet . What is relevant and assumed known includes future magnitudes that can not really be known because no one can know the future . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon those magnitudes . But they are affected in part by the decisions made by all the firm 's competitors in the present , each one assuming it has no effect . It appears that each makes decisions based on future values that their own actions make wrong . It is not surprising that no economy is perfectly competitive because it is difficult to imagine all the conditions for perfect competition being met . It is surprising that textbooks sometimes give the impression that perfect competition provides a norm against which economies should be judged . A perfectly competitive economy is undesirable in some respects , impossible in some , and even inconceivable in some . Could the same be said of any single industry in at least some of the specific respects already discussed ? If so , that is because the perfect competition concept is a sort of extreme concept . There is such a thing as " workable competition " that is inherently compatible with some conceivable and feasible norms . Perhaps more attention should be paid // to such a concept and its normative features , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normative. 15 . The Invisible Hand Adam Smith 's concept of the invisible hand is still very visible in economics books and in the ideology of laissez-faire political-economic conservatism . The idea is that a competitive market will allocate resources according to consumer demand , the self-interest of producers being made by the invisible hand of the market to serve consumer interests more reliably than dependence on producer beneficence . No one ever supposed that producer beneficence could supply public needs . But a careful reading of Adam Smith would emphasize the importance of competition in the market , and indeed the necessity of efforts to maintain competition in the face of the alleged tendency of businessmen to use even luncheon meetings to hatch plots at the expense of the consumer . This claim that the market 's invisible hand serves consumer interest requires discussion both pro and con . It is to a large extent true , and that is of tremendous importance . No comparable claim can be made generally for any alternative . The competitive market is the most economical and least bureaucratic way of doing the meritorious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as of such great importance that the efficiency of a market-type economy is often stated in terms of how well it serves the consumer . That is all true to a large and very significant extent . But it is not the whole truth . It is also true that in a market-dominated economy , " crime " in the market still pays at times , and indeed all too often . " Crime " is in quotation marks because the concept here is not a legal one . Here attention is being called to the virtually universal knowledge of , and often the experience of , practices on the part of business that either harm consumers , or at the least , result in business 's making profit out of practices that serve the consumer less well than would be both possible and much preferable to the consumer . The consumer is often not well served , and in that sense exceptions to the claims made for the invisible hand abound . In the light of the claims , actual harm to consumers could be considered a sort of crime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legal crime . The potential forms of " disservice " to consumers , often deliberate since it is perceived as more profitable // than better service to them , are virtually innumerable , so an attempt at a thoroughgoing legislative solution would result in a cure that might be worse than the disease it would be designed to cure . The fact is that markets necessarily do depend upon a culture-determined morality to work at all , since it would be impossible to spell out in written contracts everything involved in every economic transaction . A great deal of business is necessarily done with a large degree of trust , although the legal profession is able to thrive well , in part because the trust is sometimes not warranted . But , fortunately for everybody , there are many things that most businesspeople would not do just to gain economically . Whether the moral standards in the marketplace are lower or higher than at some earlier period in history is debatable . The old " caveat emptor " slogan would not be as readily defended as necessary for consumers generally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as it used to be . But clearly there is still much room for improvement in business morality in markets . And despite the degree of validity in the correctly claimed advantages of markets , the social choices will remain : continued shortcomings in consumer service , improved business morality , attempts at legislative remedies , or some combination of these . Certainly consumer education , some additional consumer protective legislation , and a substantial improvement in business morality would all be needed to make the market system serve the consumer anywhere nearly as well as the claims for the invisible hand suggest . The question is why economics textbooks do not explore this issue in depth instead of being content with praise of the market system , praise that may be deserved but that needs the qualification that much improvement would still be warranted . Indeed one may question why business does not seem to conceive that it could gain as much or more by obtaining better feedback from consumers than from other types of market surveys . Salespeople get a lot of feedback from customers , but that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back up the line and influencing the producer . Consumer sovereignty presumably would be much improved , for consumer freedom to buy or not buy can provide only limited feedback when consumer alternatives are limited , as is necessarily the case . There is an even more fundamental challenge to the claims made for the invisible hand . The claims assume that the market serves consumer demands that are independent of the market . Economists do not inquire // into the origins of consumer demands ; so far as economics is concerned , they are immaculately conceived . That leaves it to sociologists or somebody else to describe their cultural origins and changes . But what if the demands the market is said to serve so well are themselves the product of the operations of businesses that then brag about how well they serve the demands ? John Kenneth Galbraith has put it bluntly in suggesting that a squirrel cage is a dubious model for how to make an economy prosper , let alone for bragging about how well the squirrel is served . And who can deny that in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us keep the cage rotating ? Of course , advertising is necessary to enable consumers to know what is available where and at what prices . But clearly most advertising is not for the purpose , and does not serve well the purpose , of enabling consumers to purchase wisely . Indeed all too much of it has sunk to the morality of trying to treat consumers like Pavlov 's dog and make us water at the mouth for the advertised product . To the degree that such advertising is successful , the economy becomes the squirrel cage , and the claim made for the invisible hand is seriously erroneous . Fortunately our natural skepticism prevents total brainwashing by advertisers , but clearly much of their effort is subversive of the sort of economy that is defensible in invisible-hand terms . There is one very important qualification of the criticism just made . Not all production is either a response to some exogenously determined consumer demand or to demand conditioned or heavily influenced by advertising . One of the truly remarkable things about our American economy is the extent to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old products , are being introduced into the market all the time . There was no previous demand evident , but some people saw the possibility that people would want these products if they were available . One way or another , the finances and production facilities were obtained and the new products were produced , advertised , and offered to the market . Many are the products of research and development in established firms , but not all are . Not all of them turn out to be good bets or improve human well-being , but a very large number of them do because they represent either something new and desirable or something that is a real improvement on what was previously available . So it is that almost every conceivable manual operation in production itself now has a specialized machine to aid the production process . Many of these innovations have increased human // productivity tremendously . Just compare many American production methods with those of a hundred years ago here , or those now prevailing in many less developed countries . It is hard to exaggerate the importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about our rate of innovation . This is the place to explore another aspect of the legitimate defense of markets along with some implications that are generally neglected because uncomfortable qualifications arise in practice . In a broad sense , the basic problem of social organization is to structure relations between people and between groups so that both sides win in their relationships with one another instead of one winning and one losing . Communists have often claimed that in markets one side loses what the other side gains . The rebuttal is that in a system of free contract , both parties to the transaction gain . The rebuttal can be correct , although it depends upon certain conditions being met , and it leaves open the question of whether the division of the gains is equitable . Clearly if each side knows exactly what it is doing when it enters into an economic transaction , knows what its alternatives are , and indeed has comparable and viable alternatives rather than being forced to enter the transaction , either each side will gain or the transaction will not take place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by saying that both sides benefit when the relation is free of force and fraud , for only then is it truly free contract . The terms " force " and " fraud " are neat summaries , but require some elucidation . And it turns out that the conditions are not always met and sometimes not even very closely approximated for the full implications of freedom to be applicable . Force does not necessarily mean that one has a gun at one 's head to sign a contract . There is such a thing as being under more or less duress to accept terms that are not those one would willingly and freely accept if not under some type of pressure to accept them . A good illustration is the situation of the unemployed worker being offered employment terms that are not those he would freely accept if he were not in great need of a job and unable to find a satisfactory one . It turns out that true freedom is a matter of having comparable and viable alternatives and that one knows about them . Otherwise one is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As for the term " fraud , " it has connotations that are appropriate at times , but can imply something short of what is ordinarily considered outright fraud . The condition for free contract is that one knows every52 HARLAN M. SMITH thing relevant before entering the contract , not simply enough to prevent being completely defrauded . One will not knowingly enter into a transaction if there is another which would be more beneficial , for although there might not be an absolute loss , one would nonetheless lose a greater benefit that one would not knowingly and willingly lose . Again the case is made for informative advertising as essential if the claims for free contract are to be validated . Much advertising does not meet the test , for it is either uninformative or misleading or an irrelevant emotional appeal or outright emotional conditioning . The subversiveness of such advertising needs to be seen through by the victims and its intended effects on us need to be negated . A common defense of advertising that tries to subvert instead of serve the consumer is that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . People trained in psychology have applied their knowledge to manipulate other people through advertising , although it is not often as successful as the buyers of the advertising hope . The point that needs to be made here is that the test of an action is not simply its workability , but its morality as well . Hitler 's gas chambers also worked . It is immoral to treat consumers like Pavlov 's dog , even if they did not have to pay for such treatment . Unfortunately they can not avoid paying to be thus maltreated because the advertising cost is added to the prices of the products . It is simply not true that our economy would not work if it were not for the barrage of advertising of the types being criticized here . To be sure , consumer markets would be somewhat different , some things would be less profitable and other things more profitable . And the claims made for the mutuality from market transactions could be defended much more honestly because true freedom of contract would have more real meaning , people would know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even try to delude them . As a broad generalization , it may be contended that between any two individuals , between any two groups , and between the individual and the group , there is both potential mutual benefit and potential conflict of interest . The competitive market , when the above-discussed conditions are met , is a social institution that effectuates ( via the invisible hand ) the potential mutuality between the individual and the group ( in one case between the producer and consumers ) . The potential conflict lies in the division between producer and consumer of the gains from their joint transactions . Consensus on a concept of equity in the division of gains can alone resolve the conflict . Would any questions // be raised if it could be shown that 95 percent of the gain went to the producers ' side and 5 percent to the consumers ' side , or would there be equal concern if the percentages were reversed ? Should any consideration be given to how much of the gain was needed as an incentive to producers to bring the products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be discussed later . Markets certainly operate differently with different distributions of income . High incomes stuff the market ballot box . And sizable differentials in economic power , about which something has already been said , arise from sizable inequalities of income and wealth . It is quite conceivable that both parties to a transaction may gain from it , even equitably , but that third parties may suffer . That is the case when external costs are inflicted upon them . To be sure , they may benefit if there are external benefits . The latter are no problem . We might hope that there are many instances of private economic transactions as well as public policies from which everyone affected benefits . But we know that is not always the case , and we should inquire as to how common external costs are , and what , if anything , can be done about them . The claim is often made that the entire public generally benefits from a market economy , not just the parties to each transaction . Can conditions be determined that will conduce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , benefits to third parties generally ? There are some additional conditions that need to be met for a so-called market system economy and its invisible hand to operate optimally and meet the various claims made for it . Economic conditions include adequate competition and a combination of a work ethic and sufficient economic incentive for everyone . The personal qualities needed include plenty of simple honesty , initiative , innovativeness , adaptability , and a variety of skills including entrepreneurial and managerial skills . Political conditions include political stability , a framework of law defining rights and responsibilities , penalties for antisocial conduct , contract law , property law , bankruptcy law , and so on . Even cultural heritage may be helpful or not , as markets work differently in different cultural settings . Saying all this does not specify the specific content of each of these conditions , and about that much argument necessarily arises . A market system is obviously a system that entails very extensive economic interdependence . Adam Smith 's classic economic analysis // made more of the gains from specialization , division of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " invisible hand . " The productivity made possible by the interdependence described can hardly be exaggerated , for self-sufficient producers simply could not have produced modern standards of living . But the insecurities from interdependence in the face of economic change need to be spoken of in the same breath . And when the insecurities are discussed , it is desirable to consider the ways in which various insecurities can also be better dealt with through interdependence than without it . Both individual and social insurance are such methods . The invisible-hand analysis is an instance of economics serving as apologetics for the market economies . The defense of market systems establishes a norm , but the norm is not really identical , for reasons already given , with any actual market economy . The norm is sometimes stated in terms of an achievable equilibrium . An actual market never achieves an equilibrium ; it is always chasing one but never reaching it . It never reaches it because the conditions change and change the equilibrium before adjustments to previous changes in conditions are complete . And the adjustments depend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indeed we can not even specify the nature of the adjustment scientifically because of the troublesome element of free will . 16 It is indeed appropriate that economics evaluates economic arrangements in terms of a norm of efficient allocation of social resources , though the complexity and uniqueness of situations frustrate efforts to give practical advice instead of abstract generalizations . 17 The question is which economic institutions are desirable along with the market . The assumption sometimes made that institutions evolve into their most efficient form precludes consideration of institutional reform . The old concept of cultural lag would introduce a more realistic assumption . There is every reason to study the institutional frameworks of different markets in an economy and the different institutional frameworks in different economies to see what differences they make in the operation of markets . One institution , of course , is government . Government is involved in market-dominated economies in several ways not discussed here . One is through providing the legal framework in which markets operate . One is through the government sector of the economy as an alternative to some markets . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of markets . Markets are sometimes constrained by governments . There is no such thing as a market operating without constraints , including various traditional , moral , and legal constraints . Debate continues on what are legitimate constraints on economic activity in the market . 18 Society is clearly the interested party in what the constraints should be . The basic question is , how can the game be made fair ? Fair both in its processes and indeed in its outcomes ? Even economists should give some careful consideration to such issues if anything they say is to be taken seriously . Money and Finance 16 . The Influence and Safety of Finance The old saying is that it takes money to make money . Indeed to make anything by modern production methods requires ample funds . So being in a position to dole out funds on any terms gives the holders of the funds great economic power and influence . What gets produced and what does not is in large measure determined by the ability or inability to finance their production . So who holds loanable funds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tremendous economic importance . It is not hard to explain why fine office buildings and luxury apartments get built but not low-cost housing . Those with loanable funds do not gain or gain as much by financing the latter . Much loanable finance comes from savings . The rich save more than others . Business also saves , usually with an intended use in mind . Credit creation also adds to available finance . Much of the financing of economic operations is done through various financial institutions . Textbooks usually describe this adequately . Economics has much to do with the efficient allocation of resources , which is to say their use in the production of the greatest market value . Over time the increase in productivity depends heavily , but not exclusively , upon the resources allocated to research and development , to improved technologies , and to increases in the capital-to-labor ratio . This involves allocation of investable funds and is presumably based indirectly on expected consumer demand in markets , business demand , and demand by governments . The textbooks would have it that all market allocations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflecting underUNDERSTANDING // lying demand and supply conditions . The interest rate is designated as the price that allocates finance , and thus also resources , by eliminating those projects whose yields are not expected to cover the interest rate and required profit rate . In the aggregate , financial institutions as holders or creators of loanable funds certainly influence the allocation of resources . How they allocate them is said to be determined by the interest rate , meaning , of course , the pattern of interest rates , since the prices to borrow or lend funds depend upon a variety of things such as the length of the loan , the purpose , the security for the lender , judgments as to risk , and bargaining power or competition . What needs to be added explicitly is that the allocation of loanable funds ( and hence of some resources ) depends also upon the pattern of financial institutions . This is itself only in part a reflection of the prices obtainable for different types of loans . The highly developed system of financial institutions in this country is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became profitable for some institutions to specialize in one or only a few types of financial instruments . A commercial paper house , for example , is not the sort of department store of finance that a commercial bank is . But in the fields of agricultural credit and real estate credit , the market 's financial institutions were alleged not to provide fair and adequate access to loanable funds , and that led to two whole sets of federally established financial institutions in those fields . Although these institutions largely mobilized private , not goverment , funds , the allocation of funds to those two sectors of the economy increased substantially as a result . So it needs to be said that the allocation of loanable funds , and hence of resources , is determined not only by the pattern of interest rates but also by the pattern of financial institutions . Can anything be said about the merits of the resulting allocation of loanable funds ? By what criteria should it be judged , and , if lacking in any respect , by what means might it be improved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic sectors that were judged not to be receiving a fair and adequate share of funds illustrates both a criterion and a remedy already used . Note that until some recent difficulties arose that require special explanation , especially the savings-and-loan fiasco , the institutions that developed or were established operated profitably in the market without continuous subsidy . Presumably each financial institution allocates its funds wherever it // can get the highest expected rate of return , while taking risk into account , within the area in which it specializes to some degree . And the funds it can attract to lend depend also upon that rate , for that rate determines the rates it can offer . The usual story is that the economic sectors where funds are most needed will be able to pay the highest rates and will thereby attract the most funds . But it seems as though the sectors of the greatest need in some sense are those that can pay least and are therefore starved for funds . Under competitive pressures from foreign steel producers , the American steel industry needed funds to modernize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it from getting them , since the rate of return on its stock was low , a reflection of competition and the need to attract capital to modernize . One could say that the stock market was telling us that the American steel industry should close shop and our loanable funds should be invested wherever they could get a higher return . However , it is not entirely clear that it would have provided the most productive future for our country if America had lost its steel industry rather than finding ways to finance the modernizing of it . The stock market may not be an entirely trustworthy guide to where funds should be allocated . Yet its mere existence is important for raising funds for various purposes . Who would invest in financial securities if there were not such a ready market in which to resell them if one unexpectedly needed one 's money back ? To be sure , there is no guarantee that one will get back as much as one invested . But the gambling " instinct " in many people is strong enough that they take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Indeed the stock market may be dominated by speculators hoping for capital gains from reselling securities for more than they paid for them . The influence of the stock market on the availability of finance also has a pernicious influence on the time horizon of business ; namely , it often makes short-run profit considerations outweigh those that might better dominate but that would pay off only further in the future . There is a great deal of pressure now on large numbers of businesses whose stock is listed on stock exchanges to cut costs one way or another to boost the short-run price of their stock , quite without regard to the long-run consequences of such business actions . That our whole system of financial institutions needs some rethinking is obvious enough in recent years , though neither the textbooks nor the popular ideology are very helpful in provoking sufficient rethinkUNDERSTANDING // ing of the issues . For a time we even had farmers being pushed into borrowing more than long-run considerations warranted , the lenders judging on the basis of unusually high grain prices and farmers ' equity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasonable expectations regarding future farm income . Then we had rising interest rates caused by inflation creating problems for savings and loans . The remedy , like that suggested since then for commercial banks , was to improve their profits by extending their powers into competitive fields in which they had little experience . That along with deregulation , which became a religion that did not discriminate adequately between what made sense and what did not , resulted in more failures . It should not surprise us that corruption replaced good business , and that friends and white elephants were financed , from which there was very little solid prospect of repayment . We are told since then that we must limit deposit insurance and thus restore " market discipline " to keep banks and thrifts sound ? as though depositors , even large ones , could know more about a financial institution 's riskiness than can professional bank examiners . And when depositors react on the basis of rumors , we have restored not soundness but a type of instability into the financial system that deposit insurance was supposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a financial system needs to be able to withstand them without creating credit crises . For that a knowledgeable central bank like our Federal Reserve System , not dominated by profit maximization , is absolutely essential . It should be entirely obvious that the country needs to keep all its monetary transactions balances perfectly safe , whatever that takes . It should also be clear that people need perfectly safe outlets for at least some portion of their savings , a portion that each person can decide for himself or herself . People most certainly do not want to have their pensions at risk either , nor do they want to find , when they need to rely on their insurance companies , that they have loaded up with junk bonds or for any other reason have gone bankrupt . There is a dearth of leadership rethinking how to keep these institutions safer . Let students be stimulated to learn what they need to learn to contribute to solutions to these problems instead of being content to learn textbook theories and acceptance of the status quo . It should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as people need them to be , and at the same time earn rates // competitive with those offered by other financial institutions that take on more risky ventures . Where safety and liquidity are needed ( for transaction balances in commercial banks ) , and where safety and solvency are needed ( for pensions and insurance ) , there is no way they can be provided by junk bond investments or other risky new financial products . For the purposes indicated , restrictions of the relevant financial institutions to government securities or to new forms of securitization that are tied to the long-run general profitability of the economy are the sort of answer we should be considering . Of course people can take whatever risks they want in search of higher potential returns for any of their funds they are not as dependent on , and on which they do n't get and should not get any government insurance . As for Wall Street investment banking , it has been busily trying to get the Japanese to buy out U.S. businesses when it could not get enough other American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the highest expected returns for individuals and institutions with funds to play with appear to be in purely financial speculation . That can hardly be defended as in the best interest of the economy 's future . The highest returns would seem in recent years to be in financing various sorts of business takeovers . Clearly some people made lots of money in the game , much more than could be made by producing more real wealth in the same time . Commentators wondered out loud about the future of an economy when students were flocking into finance in the hopes of making their millions quickly in Wall Street , as many did . How efficient an economy is it when it uses a lot of people just in financial manipulations ? The public might be better served by their getting into the production end of business and working their way into managing businesses they learn from the ground up . But the allocation of some labor resources is itself directed not by the returns to production but by the lure of fancy returns on financial manipulations . Those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boost stock prices , for the gain of some , often load business with excessive debt . When security speculation ( gambling ) reaps much higher returns than the needed research and development , which may not follow at all , or follow to a small and less rewarded extent , something seems to be wrong . A big sample of it was reported in America : What Went Wrong ? by Barlett and Steele . The question should be raised as to what if anything can be done about the problems , and thus far there appears to be no agreed upon or // clear solution . One may ask not simply what is dominating the stock markets , but who is making the decisions that are dominating it in the present fashion , and what could change their incentives in a direction that would be more beneficial . This is not the place to review the whole discussion of the matter , nor can one expect an adequate analysis of the issues in the mass media . Suffice it here to refer to the notion that the securities markets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ security holdings were discouraged by the tax structure so that most security purchases would be made as expected long-term investments . The problem is how in any case to maintain the liquidity of the financial markets so that those investors needing to get out of them due to their own situation can do so normally without huge capital losses . It is clear that the decisions of business to seek funds through equities or debt is heavily influenced by the tax structure that allows business to treat interest payments on debt as a cost of production , and thus not taxable , while dividends paid on stock are treated as taxable profit . Of course , at least part of the dividend payments is a cost of obtaining capital just as is interest on debt , though part of dividend payments does constitute profit . The question to start with is what can be said in general about the optimal combination of debt and equity capital for businesses in different situations . Then one can consider what tax structure could best promote instead of distort the desired result . Would the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existed , lead to the optimum ? Or does the tax structure need to weight the matter in one direction instead of the other ? Unless whatever the market does is defined as optimal , the matter is suitable for analysis . Much criticism of other economies and sometimes of our own by economists has as an underlying premise that markets , at least to the degree that they are competitive , produce optimal results in all respects . Second-guessing the market or altering its results is criticized as inherently inefficient . The matter needs further consideration . Here questions are being raised as to what would define an optimal allocation of loanable funds , whether the way loanable funds are being allocated in our economy now is optimal , whether the only departures from optimality are due to government , and what sorts of changes in the economy could be defended as improving the allocation . In addition , how can we keep funds safe that need to be kept safe , and still maintain liquid markets ? // It has generally been assumed that there was no way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By all the usual criteria , that was right . Yet in many of the less developed countries , the poor often get credit , but they get it only at such usurious rates of interest that many poor farmers or businesses never succeed in getting out of debt . And then along came the very successful Grameen banks , started initially by just one person who had an idea of how it might be done and who tried it out . He lent a small sum to a group of about a dozen women for a small venture . The group was responsible for repayment of the loan of the borrower . The loan was in fact repaid , and then another member of the group got the loan , on the same terms and with the same result . This showed one way to do it , and now Grameen banks are spreading . The amount of credit thus allocated is very small , but it is highly significant . The question now is whether there is some variant of this idea that would work in America . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cities . The need is great . The risk is high but the probable rate of return for a lender is very low . Is there any way to meet the need when there are high returns that beckon elsewhere ? We need to put our brains to such problems and try some things . Habitat for Humanity has found a way to build houses for the poor where none of the usual financial inducements existed . It works ! Are there any in the class who want to tackle any of the real problems that our country and our world face and seem incapable of dealing with ? Some of them lie in the world of finance . Wall Street is not interested . It is busy wearing out those who are busy trying to make money fast . The Business Firm and Society 17 . The Firm and Profit Maximization The typical textbook treatment of the economics of the firm is fine as a beginning , but is only a beginning and not the place to stop . It is a start to think of the firm in different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its cost curves and hence finding profit maximization to be quite simple . Indeed it has the merit of being prescriptive and telling a firm desiring to maximize profit what is required in a simple situation . But few business firms produce only a single product or service , and many sell in more than one market . The analysis of price discrimination by a monopolist shows how profit can be maximized by charging different prices in markets with different known demand elasticities . In principle , multiple products may be handled by comparing marginal revenues and marginal costs for each product singly ; but there are some problems in connection with short-run fixed costs that are variable only in the long run , and joint costs of two or more products are troublesome even in the short run . Even when the textbook deals with these matters with such models as we have , it has not finished the job . The models are more prescriptive than descriptive ; they tell how to maximize profit , given certain information . That may have its uses . But the models are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the business world , or why . The analysis needs at least to be extended to deal with the considerations introduced by uncertainties to which we have alluded above , and then deal with other realities of the world of business . One would not recognize that one is talking about the same // world if one reads the textbook theory of the firm and then reads such publications as Business Week magazine . The writers for Business Week speak at length of the extent to which firms are concerned about their changing market positions or about their rates of growth , and then talk of the apparent or announced strategies of the firms to deal with these as their major problems . Indeed one can come away from reading Business Week with a serious question as to whether profit maximization is the name of the game that business firms are playing . On the basis of the textbook , one would expect to read in article after article that the strategies employed by firm after firm were chosen because they were confidently expected to increase profits . Instead one reads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responses to concern over the rate of growth , or over loss of market share , or to be efforts to increase growth or market share . Of course , one may postulate that growth or market share and profit maximization are highly if not perfectly correlated , but there is room to doubt that the motivation question is thereby resolved , whatever the correlation . Without doubt , firms that do not make profit at all do not last indefinitely . But that does not mean that firms ' first concern is profit maximization . The motivation may be just growth or market share to puff up the ego of the CEO . Where the press reports profit changes , as in market sections of the newspapers , the concern is stock prices . It should be obvious that those prices are a function of differences of opinion among not too well informed speculators . Profits are taken into account , but mainly as a matter of whether the reported profits are greater or less than the speculators had predicted . Concern with other stakeholders is little reported and stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concern has clearly reduced profits . Then they are irate and demand cost reductions . A direct study of the decision-making process in firms would seem to be in order , and discussion of such matters should be added to the theory of the firm . The decision-making structure in firms of different sizes is the place to start this part of the empirical study of firms and profit maximization . Then there is the question as to the motivation structures of the decision-makers . And finally , what is the incentive structure ? The " culture " of the business community needs direct study . Putting these things together , one would be in a position to say someUNDERSTANDING // thing about profit maximization and about other values pursued in business decisions . It rather appears as though the dominant motivation for many business decisions is the desire of some decision-maker to enhance his or her own status . This should not be too surprising , because at least some minimum status seems to be important to everyone , and it is evident that for some people a high relative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big business , at least , status in the eyes of big business leaders is conferred above all by the size of the business that one in some sense heads . Hence growth of a firm may be the main objective of the business leader , and though it may be possible only if profits are expected to permit , it is not necessarily true that the decision to grow is primarily or at all a decision to try to maximize profit . The business analog of keeping up with the Joneses is maintaining market share , and gaining market share is the analog of getting ahead of the Joneses , and that really is gaining status in the community , in this case in both the business community and the wider community . The whole wave of buyouts , takeovers , and mergers , when it involves loading a company with debt , is not obviously explicable just in terms of profit maximization for the firms , but it may be explicable in terms of income maximization for the promoters and financiers.19 That is more likely in most cases than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they will make the firms more efficient and in particular stop management from ripping off stockholders . Since they load firms with debt , it is not obvious that profit is the main motive . Maybe it is power the big raiders seek . Maybe it is the fun of a high-stakes game . Some of them take such big gambles that they lose rather than win , but the danger of losing does not seem to deter them . If the Business Week analysis stresses growth and market share , that may be too simple also , but may be more realistic than the economics textbook . It is , of course , possible to interpret Business Week 's reporting as so biased by the views of the reporters that it misrepresents the major real concerns of the business decision-makers , so it is possible to assert that the economics textbooks are not biased and are better representing reality in treating profit maximization as the only major real motivation in business decision-making , as well as the only rational one . But the reporters are not building models out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they find . The aim is empiricism , not simplified models . Perhaps economics could try to visualize the reporter 's reality // and try to explain it , rather than merely explaining models . Or they might import a little more complex human psychology into the analysis . It might yield a more realistic understanding of the world . But what about small business ? Although many people are employed by big business , the independent entrepreneur with just a few employees is by no means to be neglected . Is there something more that needs to be said about either such small business , or indeed about firms intermediate between the very large and the very small ? The struggle merely to survive can . indeed dominate some firms of any size , so considerations other than profit may be squeezed out . And for some firms that seem to have a secure place for at least a time , the old term " satisfising " may be applicable . Certainly one of the important considerations from the point of view of social progress is the extent to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promote technological progress or the sorts of innovations that are socially beneficial . More attention should be paid to what is known or can be learned about this . Maybe the big business raiders , and perhaps those making other business decisions , are like other human beings . They may act on the basis of such a complex and shifting set of motives that it would take a mind-reading psychologist to specify the relative strength of different motives in any single decision . The mixture of motives may be so complex that even the object of study may be unaware of all of them and hence might not be able to report accurately in interview studies . More study of motivation and incentive response by business decisionmakers would at least help improve upon the notion in economics that profit maximization , however profit rate may be measured , is the single all-sufficient explanation of business firm behavior . There is in any case the question of the time horizon involved in profit-maximizing decisions . It is well known that there is often a conflict between short-run profit maximization and long-run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " long run " are vague in this context , so we should speak of shorter- and longer-run time horizons . What can be said about the motivations , the incentives , and the situations that make shorter-run or longer-run time horizons predominate ? Even if no generalizations can be adequately supported , mere exploration of the matter yields a more realistic view of decision-making than if such complications are omitted in favor of simple-minded profit maximization. // Where a major concern in business decisions is the effect on the price of a firm 's stock , that in itself shortens the time horizon in the firm 's decisions . This raises a real issue if the length of the time horizon is shortened to the point where it produces economic results for the country that are judged to be unfortunate . It is already clear that the firm should be more interested for its own sake in its longer-run profitability than in the immediate impact of any decision on its immediate stock price . 18 . Oligopoly , Stability , and Public Policy After you learn what the textbooks tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem of public policy . It should be explained that the nature of interdependence among oligopoly firms may lead to an unstable market situation . So-called cutthroat competition is one possible temporary outcome . Since that sort of situation is seldom desired by the oligopolists , even though they may drift into it at times , an oligopolistic industry may develop alternative ways of making it less likely and of preventing it in some cases . The literature on industrial structure and on antitrust problems indicates the various devices that have been employed at times by various industries . Some of these may be developed to introduce or maintain stability in an oligopolistic market . But the same devices can generally be used to develop and exert semimonopoly power in the market . The devices may be in effect collusive , although they may not be overtly so , and so they may escape antitrust action against them . The fact of price leadership in an industry may , for example , be difficult to attack successfully even if it exploits consumers . The problem is how to frame public policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oligopoly market and yet protects the public against the use of oligopoly power at the expense of others , including the consumers . Consideration of that should make for a good class discussion , and whoever comes up with an adequate solution should not only go to the head of the class but should be appointed attorney general and asked to advise Congress on how to write appropriate regulatory legislation . 19 . Expectations , Uncertainties , and Probabilities The economic principle is applicable whenever the given objective is maximizing something with scarce means and there is full knowledge // of the relations between means and ends . Most microeconomic analysis is carried on by postulating , as if they were known , the relevant marginal magnitudes , be they marginal utilities , marginal productivities , or marginal costs and marginal revenues . That sort of analysis has direct usefulness where the magnitudes are indeed known , or where one can make quite good and reliable estimates of them . What one may actually know , though sometimes one does not have really good data on even this , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the past . The future is inherently unknowable , but it is the future results of present or future decisions that are the needed basis for maximizing decisions , not the results of past decisions in circumstances that may not turn out to be exactly identical . One necessarily bases decisions on expected magnitudes of marginal gains and marginal costs that would result from various decisions . The past is , to be sure , the first and perhaps the best basis for forming one 's expectations of future magnitudes . Expectations need to try to take into account anything that suggests the future might be somewhat different from the past . If the expectations turn out to be fulfilled in all respects , after applying the marginal principle correctly , one will succeed in maximizing whatever one was trying to maximize . But the unforeseen and the unforeseeable may result in failure to maximize , despite rational behavior , though one may not know what would have been better even in retrospect unless it is possible to get enough data after the fact ( and unless the data would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Uncertainty with respect to the future may be decreased if a decision is simply another in a long line of similar decisions in a situation that can reasonably be expected to be similar to many in the past . Looking at the results of such decisions in such situations may show the relative frequencies of various results , and if there is reason to expect the future to be similar , one can attach various probabilities to each result , based on the past experience . One might then act as though the most probable result is what will happen , or try to take into account also the possibility , and degree of probability , that something else might happen . If one or more of the other things that might happen creates a loss instead of the hoped-for maximized gain , the known past frequencies of losses provide a basis for some form of insurance against the undesired outcomes , especially if the present decision is only one of numerous comparable decisions being made by different people in a given short time period . Where there is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made in the face of various amounts of uncertainty , and the outcomes may or may not come close to those sought . It is a commonplace that , although decision-makers have different degrees of aversion to taking risks in the face of uncertainty , generally some chance of greater gain is needed to induce people to take risks if they could avoid them . Oligopoly theory introduces a decision situation in which the result of a given decision by a firm depends on the reactions by other firms . The theory may be applicable in other situations , including various personal actions to which other people may react in different ways that affect the obtainment of one 's objectives . International relations clearly need to be envisaged in terms of the relative likelihoods of various foreign reactions to a government 's actions . In all such applications of the analysis , it is important to avoid wishful thinking and have some objective basis on which to form expectations . If one sets up in a simple matrix the expected outcomes from different reactions of rivals to alternative actions a firm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action by choosing the one that might give the best result if rivals reacted as one would wish . But it may be relatively unlikely that rivals will act in a way that gives the best result . In oligopoly theory it is customary to assign probabilities to the various reactions of rivals to each decision a firm is considering . Then clearly one has a decision problem not reducible to the simple economic principle . A firm might base a decision on what are assumed to be the most likely reactions by rivals for each alternative action under consideration . One can see the rationale behind other decision rules that might be used . For example , the firm may choose so as to be sure to avoid a possible catastrophic loss . Or , if the situation is highly repetitive , it may calculate the statistical " expected value " of each action and alternative reaction and choose the highest expected value . Such analyses are generally fun , and to some extent more realistic than analyses that assume that the results are always sufficiently well known and uncomplicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the decision matrix is still an academic game . The real difficulty is that one generally does not know enough to be really confident in assigning probabilities to the reactions of othets , // and does not know enough to be confident in one 's estimate of the outcomes even if others ' reactions to one 's own actions were known . There may be different degrees of uncertainty about these two things in any situation , and in different situations , and for different types of decisions . Textbooks do not go out of their way to emphasize these degrees of uncertainty , though uncertainty is the name of the game of economic decision-making , and indeed infuses all of life 's decisions . So while expectations are governed by many things , it is really uncertainty that prevails over risk . That should at least be recognized in the textbooks . 20 . Externalities and Efficiency The economics textbooks now introduce the concepts of external benefits and external costs as sort of a minor postscript to microeconomic analysis . The indication is that where some costs are external @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it by the market for maximum efficiency , and where there are external benefits , more resources should be allocated . The suggestion may be made that taxes and subsidies might be used to internalize the costs and benefits and thus achieve greater allocative efficiency . A common illustration of external costs is pollution by a producer , and a common illustration of external benefits is education ( so-called , but really schooling ) . Here the only quarrel with the usual treatment of externalities is the usual paucity of instances and the treatment of externalities as sort of an addendum to microeconomics rather than as a major qualification of the whole corpus of conclusions usually reached in the main body of microeconomic theory . It is not uncommon for a distinction to be made between private costs and social costs . Externalities may be discussed as instances where marginal private cost or benefit do not coincide with marginal social cost or benefit , and where it is therefore desirable from the point of view of efficient resource allocation for society to try to make the private and social marginals coincide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of a case can be made for letting some person 's or firm 's private net accounting override the net accounting that embraces everyone else . But what should go into a full social accounting ? We might well take the cue from the subtitle of a book by E.F . Schumacher , Small Is // Beautiful , subtitled Economics as if People Mattered . If the well-being of people is what it ought to be about , microeconomic analysis would have to focus substantial attention directly upon working conditions and living conditions . There should be as much attention to what is now loosely called the quality of life as to the quantity of goods and services produced , which are indeed related to well-being but not to be equated with it . There needs to be more talk about both the utilities and disutilities produced ( and about the disutilities not reduced ) by the manner in which the economy operates , and which may not be registered or registered adequately in the market price system . Some of this is external not only to the producer firms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , the quality of the work experience can vary a great deal without that registering in costs borne by the firm and hence in market price , but it may make a whale of a difference in the utilities and/or disutilities of the work experience , or in plain language in the satisfactions and well-being of the worker . Cost to the firm and social cost may diverge . It may or may not actually cost the firm more per unit of output in some cases to alter the production process and to somehow exhibit more respect for the worker 's ideas and feelings . Economics has traditionally treated work as disutility , and indeed much of it necessarily involves disutility , sometimes very severe disutility . But it is also true that life is very much better when the work to be done is such that , or is organized so that , the worker can indeed find much satisfaction ( utility ) in its proper performance . The total utility produced might be easier to achieve now by improvements in the work experience than by the production of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be clear that improving the work experience does not always have a net cost to a firm , although when it does , it might still be a proper cost to bear . Employees are very seldom provided incentive by the profit motive to work harder or to improve the quality of the products they work on . The connection is too indirect and often there is no actual connection . The employer can hire the workers , but how hard they work or how well is not just a matter of their pay . They are apt to respond very favorably to any number of incentives that add to their initial motivation . Often the worker knows better than the boss or foreman how best to do the job assigned . How well he or she works may depend heavily on whether the worker 's opinion on such matters is sought , respected , and allowed to influence the work process . Atten72 HARLAN M. SMITH tion to machinery safeguards , to any possible flexibility for the worker , to mechanizing simple repetitive operations that machines could do , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handsomely for a business . But in any social accounting , the more that humane considerations play a part in organizing and carrying on the production process , the more efficient that production process can be said to be ; that is , the higher its productivity in human well-being is likely to be . Of course , we can not put numbers on human well-being or satisfaction in simple fashion , as the market can on money outlays or money receipts . So we write and study economics as though it was only about the numbers that we can talk glibly about . We sometimes dismiss what even those numbers are supposed to be about , as if that was in a realm that could be ignored because of lack of other simple numbers to measure it . Similarly with respect to living conditions , these are in substantial measure produced by the economy . The disutilities produced or not reduced by the way the economy works ( with much help from government , especially local democratic government ) are not , as they might well be , treated as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such specialties as urban economics are likely to devote much attention to the theory of location of firms , which , of course , is not irrelevant , but then relegate consideration of what might better be the heart of the subject , the quality-of-living conditions produced and the social consequences thereof , to the sociologist . Is the Japanese economy to be considered efficient because it can export competitively in present circumstances although the living conditions of its workers are extremely poor , even by their own standards ? Was our economy more efficient by employing some labor in so-called sweatshop conditions than if , even at greater monetary cost , working conditions had been humane ? There is something wrong with our measure of efficiency if we say the sweatshop was more efficient . What is being said here is that the microeconomic analysis of the efficiency of the economy that confines itself to market measures and criteria of efficiency is defective and can be seriously misleading . Our criterion of efficient allocation of resources should explore externalities more fully . We should deal with social versus private costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market prices , at the heart of the analysis , rather than as a mere postscript . External benefits and costs are widespread . They are the general case , not to he // dealt with as a minor postscript to the main analysis . We need to focus on what we know or can try to learn about working conditions and living conditions created . It is important how the economic process and its consequences treat people . We need to study economics as if people were all that mattered , as Schumacher implied . The human well-being created in the process or ignored or worsened is the most important thing about it . The simpler matters and the more readily measurable results to which the discipline confines itself are important but are not all-important or as important . Economics , at every point in the analysis , should be primarily about all that matters to people in the economic processes . After all , about half of the waking lives of employees are spent working . And women homemakers , who are usually not directly paid a wage for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economics textbooks totally ignore any issues that should be raised in that connection . How do we start to do so ? 21 . Responsibility to Stockholders and Others The stockholders in a corporation are , in law , the owners of the firm , so , according to one ideology , the only criterion applicable in judging the firm 's behavior is how well the firm does by its stockholders . Even that is not a totally unambiguous criterion , for it may have to do only with how high the dividend rate is , or it may lead to consideration of the growth of book value of the stock , or to the price of the firm 's stock in the stock market at some time relative to book value , or simply to appreciation of the stock in the stock market ( a matter affected by many things , some external to the firm ) , or it may require consideration of stock dilution , or the implications of debt burden and leverage , and so on . Incorporation of a business venture can be a great advantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become a dominant form of business organization . A major advantage is the limited liability of stockholders , a limitation that is of importance in raising capital by spreading ownership of the firm . Bankruptcy law is also important in providing firms a legal way to cancel some of their debts , at the expense of their creditors , and to have another set of opportunities to make a go of it . The corporation is a legal creation , and as such is one of the most important social-economic inventions . Iiut just as no individual person or group can be allowed unlimited // freedom without regard to the social consequences of their actions if society is to be even semicivilized , so no business firm , incorporated or not , can legitimately claim that any restraint upon its activities is unwarranted interference with its freedom or the freedom of its owners . Indeed , the major defense of the corporation as a legal creation is that , by granting it certain powers and privileges , society is better served than if the corporate form of business organization had never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutions and even individuals , in terms of their social contributions , not in terms of how well they do for themselves , perhaps even at the expense of others in society . The very existence of corporations as a legally created and socially favored form of business organization can be justified only by social consequences , as can the degree to which they are free or regulated or permitted to continue to operate . The implication of this is that corporations are inevitably and properly judged , by those other than their ever changing owners , in terms that go beyond how well they do for their stockholders . This does not imply that owners are not entitled , within the legal framework that both benefits them and limits them , to try to advance their own interests , however they may be legally conceived . Indeed there are a number of ways in which they are free to try to do so . One of the most obvious is that disgruntled stockholders can sell their stock . This loses any legal power to change the firm 's policy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstances it may be their quickest and most effective way to protect themselves against further loss and to express displeasure with the management of the firm . It is also true that a great deal of buying or selling stock may often have nothing to do with direct concern over a firm 's conduct , about which buyers and sellers of stock often know very little . It may merely represent a guess as to what will happen to the price of the stock in the near future , and that may be primarily a guess as to what much of the rest of those operating in the stock market at the time will guess that most of the rest of the people in the market at the time will soon do in buying or selling that stock . To the extent that it is a market made by people trying to outguess what most of the rest of them will do , it is not primarily an expression of how well a generally stable body of owners thinks a firm is doing for them . It remains true , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extent and express their // displeasure with a firm by disposing of its stock . It is also true that if the corporation has done too badly by stockholders , an individual 's attempt to sell stock may entail a capital loss , so the protection is not complete . However , the capital loss may be due not to firm mismanagement but to the fact that developments in the firm 's market quite beyond its control , even a general economic recession or depression , had a negative impact on it , no matter how well it was managed . In a sense , acquiring ownership of a firm 's stock is itself a free choice to gamble upon that not happening , as well as upon firm management . The major way for owners to protect and advance their interest in a corporation is through their legal power to hire and fire the board of directors , and thereby the management , and to determine the policies of a corporation . As everyone should know now , at least since the early study of The Modern Corporation by Gardner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A small controlling interest in a corporation may in effect render the bulk of stockholders powerless , given the mechanical and other difficulties in effective majority rule and the even lesser power of other minorities to protect themselves in and through voting in stockholder meetings . In many cases , once top management is in the saddle , over time it may be able to secure appointment of its own chosen board of directors and thereby constitute itself a self-perpetuating corporate oligarchy . The strongest case for some unfriendly corporate takeovers is that it can throw out such entrenched management or force it to operate more in the interest of the stockholders . The rub may be that the stockholders by that time are primarily financial operators in it for a stock market gain , not old-line owners seeking different policies , better handling of their money , or deserving better treatment by the firm in some respect . It may be clear that top management is rewarding itself too royally , especially when the firm is not or may not be able to do well , but raiders may also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are hardly able to pose well as saviors of stockholders . Raiders may also strip a firm of its accumulated cash , which may not always be defensible either . And when Wall Street busily engages in efforts to sell American firms to foreigners , it is hardly trying to protect their American owners . Then there are the firms that set themselves target rates of profit ; they might be reasonable or unreasonable . And if one of them does not make the target rate of profit , even though it may still be a very profitable firm , it may restructure , firing employees en masse , perhaps // closing plants , and trying another tack to get the target rate of profit without regard to anything else whatsoever . Whatever may be said about the adequacy of corporation owners ' recourse to protect and promote their interests , as they see them , the public necessarily rejects the ideology that corporations are to be judged only in terms of how well they do for their ever changing stockholders or their often overpaid top managers . And management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them in additional terms , even when they sound as though they would prefer to defend the older ideology that stockholders are their only proper concern and that they have no public responsibilities . They can not avoid knowing that their powers and privileges , which the law confers upon the corporation , necessarily imply some limits on what they can justifiably do , and entail some responsibilities to serve the broader society in return for the powers and privileges granted . Nor is it simply up to a corporation to decide what public responsibility it might choose to acknowledge . It is not always made clear that this ideological issue is what underlies much public debate over so-called government interference with business and its freedom . The textbooks are not doing their proper job if ownership is treated simply as freedom and obligation to maximize profits , for there are other interests that necessarily enter public concern . Or as the matter is often put now , there are the other stakeholders , besides stockholders , who have an important stake in how the business operates . What needs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organization , not only the corporation . All this the textbooks need to explore more fully than they often do . Three widely used economics-principles textbooks do not even have the stakeholder term in the index . The stakeholder concept is explicitly rejected by some business spokespersons , but it is embraced by others who proudly proclaim how well their business serves the community . The concept is that business management has important responsibilities to all stakeholders , not simply those who are at least temporarily stockholders . It is not hard to identify other stakeholders and what their interest is . What a firm can do or should be expected to do to protect or further those interests , and how to balance the interests against each other , is far from clear , and requires much careful analysis . It is also hard to show how , if at all , the different stakeholders can now protect and advance their interest in the // behavior of a business , and still harder to formulate public policy that would secure the most defensible balance among the various interests . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussion . The employees of a firm are obvious stakeholders . Their concern is not only their income from the firm but how well they are treated by management . Labor unionism has been one method of trying to improve the pay received by some employees in some firms , but it has done more to check serious arbitrary actions of management in some cases than to affect the real wage rate of labor in general , a matter that depends more on the general level of labor productivity . Leaving a firm that treats its labor badly and taking jobs with other firms that treat it well has not , while formally an option , been as viable a real alternative as some ideologues would have us believe . As this is written , there appears to be increasing recognition that the respect given the opinion of the person doing a certain job , and improvement in the general treatment of the work force in a firm , can pay well in terms of increased labor productivity . True or not , it would be argued by some that any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be protected and promoted by one means or another for its own sake . It just might be that the nation 's total utility or satisfaction could be directly increased more along this line than by any possible resulting increase in productivity of gadgets and adult toys for the big middle class that buys the bulk of the economy 's output . These essays have already given attention to this and related matters , but it would be difficult to stress all such considerations too strongly if one is to learn properly what is really important in economics . The question that should be raised at this point is how best to promote employee interests and meet employee needs if that does not now occur " naturally " on a sufficient scale . Employees are a business firm 's most important stakeholders and ones it daily affects directly over and over . The customers of a firm constitute another stakeholder group that sometimes can protect itself by buying elsewhere if a market is sufficiently competitive , but in many cases they may not have a viable option or may not know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only a well-financed research lab testing a group of competing products could tell whether , if at all , the product really served the consumer interest as well as possible for the costs incurred . The textbook may speak highly of the market allocation of resources // being determined by consumer sovereignty . But Nader 's Raiders , while sometimes making statements that are too wild , can easily document cases where the consumer interest is not sufficiently considered by firms and could indeed be better served at similar cost . The issue for a business firm is sometimes short-run profit or long-run steady customers and long-run profitability . Good service to the consumer is now a proclaimed objective of many businesses , but whether this is advertising or the real objective is not always clear . At least there is a gain for consumers in that the " caveat emptor " slogan is heard less now and probably needed less now , though there are always enough scams around that the consumer still needs to be wary at times . The public policy question is , what is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at complete protection would probably be regarded correctly as a cure that could be worse than the disease . But even one Thalidomide case , to take an example , is sufficient for most people to reject a completely laissez-faire approach . Consumers also want meat inspection and want autos to be free of defects that could cause fatal accidents . There are other examples of cases where consumers clearly want protection they can not get just by market competition . Consumer Reports is a private effort to research products in the interest of consumers , and its efforts are valuable , but its resources are too limited to keep up with continuous changes in products . Consumer sovereignty is said by the textbooks to be very important , and they assume it to be a reality . But they do not give much attention to the extent to which real consumer problems prevent any fully effective consumer sovereignty . The nature of advertising has already been mentioned in another essay , but needs consideration here as well . Textbooks do not give the same attention to the issue of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to some other things , though the consumer policy problem is much more complicated . Fortunately the invisible hand about which we already spoke does reward business better for providing what consumers want than by producing things they do not want . And often competition takes the form of trying to serve consumers better . However , it is still true that business could often do much better by consumers as an important group of stakeholders than they do now . If they did , less regulation in the consumer interest would be called for or needed . The suppliers of inputs to a firm should also he considered to he // stakeholders of a sort . This is especially true when a single firm takes such a large portion of the supplier 's potential output that its life or death depends upon the continuous renewal of a single order , and the supplier is under duress to accept the terms dictated by the firm it has become so dependent upon . One may counsel a firm never to become that dependent , but the question also is how any power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something that can be abused . Responsible use of it avoids abusive use . The general community in which any of a firm 's operations is located constitutes a stakeholder also , and a very important one . Different firms ' attitudes toward that stakeholder vary widely , which is often seen when a locally owned firm in a community is taken over by an absentee owner . Students may be aware of the problems sometimes arising with absentee ownership if their rooming house is not shared by the owner . Unfortunate is the community whose business firms have no concern for the community but only for top management and/or other stockholders . Firms typically make many decisions that affect the community favorably or unfavorably . To be sure , it is not easy to define how far that responsibility to the community should go , beyond avoiding harm . Many a town or city is a much better place to live , and indeed to do business in , if the business leaders use their clout and some of their firms ' resources to improve the community itself . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a community to have a large firm suddenly close and move to another locality , though that sometimes happens . That harms more than its own employees . Competitors are also a stakeholder , in a sense . Predatory pricing to force them out of the business is not unknown , nor are other forms of unfair competition . It is sometimes pointed out that one stakeholder is unrepresented in the above list , the environment . The current health and long-run viability of the economy 's natural resource base , its natural capital , is constituted by its entire natural environment . It is affected by pollution and depletion , the former usually dealt with in the textbook section on external costs and the latter often ignored in economics textbooks . The environmental movement may soon have more impact on economicsprinciples textbooks , as there are now entire courses on environmental economics . As yet there are no economies operating on a long-run sustainable basis . Some places in the world economy are overloading their life support system , overcropping , overgrazing , overfishing , and     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
