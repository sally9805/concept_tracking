A poetic episode in our national history occurred July 4 , 1826 . On that 50th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence , the author of that founding document , Thomas Jefferson , died . So did John Adams , who did as much as anyone to produce the occasion for Jefferson 's document . The second president 's last words referred to the third president : " Thomas Jefferson survives . " The third president 's last words were , " Is it the Fourth ? " <p> Three days later , in Quincy , Massachusetts , after attending Adams 's funeral , as Joseph J. Ellis has described in his book on John Adams , some dignitaries were taken to see a prosaic force that would shape what the two Founders had helped to found . They saw something novel . They saw a railroad , one of the nation 's first . It was not much of one ; it was built to carry granite a few miles from Quincy to Boston for the Bunker Hill monument . But it was huge as a harbinger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not just because , in the coming war against Southern insurrection , they were to help the army of the central government settle a constitutional argument about the primacy of that government . Railroads also had constitutional consequences because they influenced Americans ' thinking about the nature of their regime . Railroads , and the industrialism of which they were emblematic , filled our " extensive Republic " with energy . Our big country acquired a big economy , and a big government . <p> Today , conservatism is asking whether a big government is merely a contingent , or a necessary , outcome in a big country with a big economy . That the country was to be big was never in doubt . In the Revolutionary era , there were just four million free Americans , and 80 percent of them lived within 20 miles of Atlantic tidewater . Yet these Americans audaciously called their legislature the Continental Congress . They knew where they were headed  --  for California . They would get there by many means , including railroads . To promote construction of these steel sinews of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For example , it gave 4.8 million acres of Nebraska  --  one-tenth of that state  --  to the Union Pacific . <p> By 1908 , eight decades after the deaths of Adams and Jefferson , a professor of political science marveled at what industrialism had wrought : " The copper threads of the telegraph run unbroken to every nook and corner of the great continent , like the nerves of a single body Railways lie in every valley and stretch across every plain . . . Industrial organization knows nothing of state lines , and commerce sweeps from state to state . " So wrote Professor Woodrow Wilson , five years before becoming president . <p> He became the first president to criticize the Constitution , which he considered more ingenious than was suitable for changed conditions . The Constitution , he said , is elegantly Newtonian with its checks and balances , but it is not conducive to the energy and dispatch requisite for regulating an urban industrial society . He postulated the need for heroic presidents to marshal public opinion in order to override the government 's constitutional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infusion of direct popular will , Wilson considered necessary to enable the national government to implement the national idea . He seems not to have worried about the possibility that his ideas might encourage passivity in the public , producing a nation of mere followers . When Wilson wrote and governed , Newton was out of fashion , Darwin was in , and the Constitution was coming to be thought of in organic terms , as a " living " document . However , it was unclear , then as now , what a " living , " evolving , ever-in-flux Constitution is . What can a constitution constitute if , instead of shaping its times , it takes its shape from its time ? <p> In 1893 , three years after the Census Bureau declared the closing of the frontier , Wilson had pondered the changes that were challenging the old American faith that freedom is , in large measure , a function of space  --  that freedom consists partly of being unable to see the smoke from your neighbor 's cabin or to hear the sound of his ax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grow old , compact our people , study the delicate adjustments of an intricate society . " In classical political theory , compactness was a precondition for a successful republic  --  a small population compacted in a small polity . The audacity of the American experiment was  --  is  --  its attempt to have a republic that is big , but in which life nevertheless is conducive to the virtues requisite for self-government , the virtues of self-reliance and self-restraint . However , in the century since Wilson brooded about the emergence of " an intricate society , " our big country has acquired a big government that seems to foster dependence , and that inflames incontinent appetites , including appetites for government provision of illimitable wants . Defending the political vocation <p> We are in the twelfth month of a year of intense debate about our domestic arrangements , the most intense debate in 62 years , since 1933 . Then , the New Deal accelerated the already-changing relationship between the individual citizen and the central government . Since then , government has become omnipresent in American society . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it has suffered a debilitating leakage of legitimacy . <p> This has provoked a conservative critique of the nation 's political tendencies in this century and has produced this year of conservative opportunity . Unfortunately , conservatism is not yet measuring up to this moment . Perhaps conservatism has become intoxicated by triumphalism ; perhaps it has become intellectually flaccid because of the sterility of its opposition  --  contemporary liberalism . In any case , conservatism 's critique of current conditions is not as searching as it should be , and its prescriptions raise three troubling questions . First , does conservatism have a distinctive and defensible understanding of the Constitution , or merely a different policy agenda ? Second , is conservatism unaware of its own problematic tensions ? Third , is conservatism capable of identifying and proclaiming the austere principle of our constitutional republican government ? <p> Woodrow Wilson , to give him his due , once put the principle succinctly . He said that our constitutional government has not only " exalted " the individual , it has " thrown him upon his own resources , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strings and trust him to see and seek his own rights . " Our republic 's premise , said Wilson , is that " no man must look to have the government take care of him , but that every man must take care of himself . " Such government does not merely presuppose " intelligence and independence of spirit , " it " elicits intelligence and creates independence of spirit . " <p> Can contemporary conservatism stiffen its sinews and summon up its blood and talk in that tone of voice to the American people ? If not , the incapacity may reflect what can be called the cultural contradictions of conservatism . <p> A few years ago there was lively debate about the " cultural contradictions of capitalism . " The postulate was that capitalism is jeopardized by its success : Its prodigies of wealth-creation produce habits and character traits that subvert the very virtues  --  thrift , industriousness , deferral of gratification  --  that are capitalism 's prerequisites . This was not a new worry . It had occurred to that accomplished worrier , John Adams . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell me how to prevent riches from being the effects of industry ? Will you tell me how to prevent need of a John Adams as it addresses the nation 's principal worry , the condition of its culture , meaning all the institutions that compose civil society . <p> The contradiction in today 's conservatism is , happily , a contingent , not a necessary , aspect of conservatism . But it can be a crippling contingency if it is not corrected . It is this : Conservatism is advocating not just disrespect for many activities of government , but even blanket disdain for government , and hence for the political vocation . However , conservatism 's vision of civic virtue depends on more than adherence to a particular policy agenda . It depends on respect , even reverence , for our political regime  --  for our constitutional order understood as a formative enterprise . <p> Conservatism has come to power in the 1990s largely because this is the decade in which the nation has looked into the mirror and blanched . What Tocqueville called " the slow and quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor quiet nor wholesome . The crux of the conservative diagnosis is that " big government " is to blame . There is much truth in this diagnosis , but it is by no means the whole story , and it is a diagnosis altogether too easy for conservatism 's own good . <p> Contemporary conservatism 's greatest service to society has been to refocus attention on an elemental fact that the Founders understood : Society is a crucible of character formation . Human beings are political , meaning social , beings , fulfilled in associations . Government can damage associational life , and big government can do big damage . <p> Our party system was born of an argument about the action of American society on itself and on the character of Americans . Hamiltonians wanted a society of high-velocity commercial energy and restless , striving individualism in order to produce national greatness . Jeffersonians aimed to promote other virtues , particularly simplicity and the serene independence of the self-sufficient yeoman . Such Americans would , Jefferson thought , avoid the degrading dependency of the urban manufacturing workers who , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and " have no time to think . " <p> We have been worrying and arguing about national character ever since . Sometimes the argument has taken comic turns , as when , in 1908 , the Democratic candidate for president , William Jennings Bryan , said that the Republican candidate , Vice President William Howard Taft , was unfit to be president because , being a Unitarian , Taft did not believe in the virgin birth . But , more often than not , in arguments about the national bank and abolitionism and immigration and prohibition and desegregation and , today , popular entertainment , American political argument has been driven by serious concerns about character . The threat of historicism <p> The Founders bequeathed us a political order founded on realism about human attributes , beginning with this truth : In human beings , interestedness is a given , virtue must be acquired . Contemporary conservatism is resoundingly right when it argues that government itself has become inimical to those virtues essential to responsible self-government . It has become inimical because it fosters both dependency on government and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factional advantage . But does conservatism have the steely resolve required to tell the country the hard truth about how radically it has gone wrong in its thinking about , and expectations of , government ? <p> Conservatism is driving today 's political debate because it senses , and is struggling to act on , the fact that human beings are biological facts , but citizens suited to self-government are social artifacts . However , conservatism is not yet sufficiently clear-sighted about how our constitutional order is supposed to contribute to the creation of such artifacts . And conservatism is not alert to the way its own tenets can complicate the creation of virtuous citizens . <p> Let us be clear about what conservatism is not saying about citizens as social artifacts . Conservatives do not subscribe to , indeed are implacably hostile to , the idea that human nature has a history . The hostility is implacable because that idea is utterly subversive of government based on respect for natural rights . This is so because if human nature has a history , then there really is no such thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is unchanging . <p> The idea that human nature has a history  --  that human beings only have a nature contingent on their time and place  --  is the idea that has animated modern tyrannies . It has done so because people susceptible to that idea are susceptible to the idea that self-government is a chimera  --  an impossibility  --  because the self is a fiction or , at best , a flimsy reflection of the individual 's social setting . To say that human nature is utterly plastic is to open the way to governments that regard the creation of a new , improved form of humanity the highest government project . Such governments are apt to unleash " consciousness-raisers , " who would use political power to extirpate " false consciousness . " Such people insist that , until proper consciousness is made universal , any consent necessarily arises from false consciousness and , hence , is not worth seeking . <p> However , to say , as conservatives are prepared to , that individuals are not entirely autonomous and unconditioned is not to say that human nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the manipulations of government or society . On the contrary , conservatism warns that people who believe there is no human nature must believe that no rights are natural rights . Indeed , if there is no human nature , then rights are just appetites tarred up in the aggressive language of rights-talk in order to acquire momentum for respect . <p> Conservatism seeks equilibrium , arguing that nature has political claims and that nurturing has a political role . Nature 's political claims rise from this fact : The idea of human nature involves the idea of essential human qualities or virtues that are conducive to excellence . And the task of political nurturing takes its bearings from that idea of excellence . Statecraft is soulcraft <p> Wise conservatives take that task seriously . For example , John Adams , perhaps the most conservative Founder , declared that education makes a greater difference between man and man than nature has made between man and brute . The Founders understood that popular government would be  --  could not help but be  --  a formative experience , for better or worse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for our souls . Today , conservatives correctly argue that our government has become a deforming force , corrupting the country 's character . They say government has become a bland leviathan , confirming Tocqueville 's warning that government can " degrade men without tormenting them . " <p> However , if conservatives are to be faithful to the full philosophy of the Founders , conservatives must understand that hostility to government , especially hostility to the central government , is not sufficient . Indeed , it is not permissible . The Founders believed that the nation should be , and would be , constantly conditioned by its founding . Our constitutional government was to be both agent of , and shaper of , the citizenry . It is not true that they subscribed to the notion that government should be neutral regarding the cultivation of virtues  --  regarding , that is , what we today , in the thinness of our moral vocabulary , call " values . " The Founders intended the Constitution to promote a way of life , and they understood that to promote a way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the words of one of the Constitution 's first great construers , John Marshall . In his biography of Washington he wrote : <p> The great and visible economic improvement occurring around 1790 was in part due to the influence of the Constitution on habits of thinking and acting , which though silent , was considerable . In depriving the states of the power to impair the obligations of contracts , or to make anything but gold and silver a tender in payment of debts , the conviction was impressed on that portion of society which had looked to the government for relief from embarrassment , that personal exertion alone could free them from difficulties ; and an increased degree of industry and economy was the natural consequence of this opinion . <p> Note this : Marshall said the Constitution was designed to encourage particular habits of thinking and acting . From visible habits we make inferences as to invisible attributes of the soul . Therefore statecraft , as the Founders understood it , is soulcraft . Hence politics has a great and stately jurisdiction , and is an inherently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given time . <p> Note this , too : Marshall understood that acceptance of the Constitution was an act of self-denial in the name of self-government . The Constitution deprived the states of certain powers that they had used , under the Articles of Confederation , licentiously . The states had produced what Madison tartly called " a luxuriancy of legislation . " Because the Founders understood the contagion of faction , they did not believe that the best government is always that which is closest to the people . Being unsentimental about the people , the Founders were not sentimental about state and local governments . As Marshall saw , by depriving states of some of their powers , the Constitution helped to equip citizens for the dignity of life without degrading dependence on government . <p> The Anti-Federalists opposed the Constitution in the name of intimate government ; the Founders framed the Constitution to provide effective government and to spare citizens the discomfort and dependence that comes from being intimate with government . The Founders hoped that one effect of exalting the central government over other governments would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , state , and national . This , the Founders thought , would encourage self-reliance in the pursuit of happiness . Born to be big ? <p> This , then , was an important dimension of the rationale for a strengthened central government . But that government was supposed to be strong within the strict limits of enumerated powers  --  powers that Madison insisted were " few and defined . " However , we have not had such a government for a long time . Indeed , it is arguable that we never really did . <p> From its first year , the national government has asserted powers proportional to national needs , and , from the first , it has defined national needs in ways that did not produce government precisely , or even notably , limited in sphere or methods . Of the 39 members of the House of Representatives who were present when the First Congress took up its first order of business , 16 were Framers  --  they had been at the Constitutional Convention . Yet their first order of business was the enactment of tariffs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but as instruments of what today is called " industrial policy . " The aim : the promotion of local or regional interests and the purchase of political advantage . Was that the exercise of an enumerated power ? <p> The enumeration of powers in Article I , Section 8 of the Constitution includes the power to " lay and collect taxes . . . to . . . provide for . . . the general welfare " and " to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing powers . " Jefferson insisted that the word " necessary " meant more than just " useful , " but , in practice , it never has meant more than that . <p> In 1944 , with the nation more at war than ever before , and with the federal government permeating the nation 's life more than ever before or since , Justice Felix Frankfurter , writing for the Court , recurred to Woodrow Wilson 's theme of the effect of modern technology on federalism . Frankfurter insisted , <p> The interpenetrations of modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not for us to make inroads on our federal system either by indifference to its maintenance or excessive regard for the unifying forces of modern technology . Scholastic reasoning may prove that no activity is isolated within the boundaries of a single State , but that can not justify absorption of legislative power by the United States over every activity . <p> Well . Such reasoning may be , in Frankfurter 's pejorative term , scholastic , and such " absorption " may be , as Frankfurter insisted , unjustified , but Frankfurter went immediately on to say that the Court should do next to nothing about it . He said : <p> When the conduct of an enterprise affects commerce among the states is a matter of practical judgment . . . . The exercise of this practical judgment the Constitution entrusts primarily and very largely to the Congress , subject to the latter 's control by the electorate . <p> Just so . The lesson of 206 years of constitutional history is clear : If the federal government is to be limited , it will not be limited primarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which has proven to be merely a parchment barrier to enlargements of the federal government 's sphere . Never mind the Supreme Court 's recent small nibbling at the far fringes of powers exercised under the Commerce Clause . Limits on government must be grounded in the character of the people . However , the good news is that the character of the people can be shaped by constitutional arrangements and arguments , if they are given proper exegesis . <p> Big government did not fall out of the sky , unbidden , like hail in Kansas . And it was not foisted on a reluctant public . It grew for many reasons . Daniel Webster , a champion of the national idea , championed the Delaware breakwater as an " internal improvement " by the federal government because neither Pennsylvania nor New Jersey nor Delaware would build it : They would not pay all the costs because they would not get all the benefits . One use to which the Interstate Commerce Commission was put after its creation in 1887 was to keep certain east-west freight rates low in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do you think large federal entitlement programs are a recent development ? In 1893 , 42 percent of federal expenditures were for Civil War veterans . The federal Meat Inspection Act of 1906 , which initiated federal meat inspection , did not come about simply because the nation 's stomach was turned by Upton Sinclair 's novel The Jungle . The federal government began regulating the meat-packing industry because the industry wanted it to . The industry wanted it because state regulations were so unreliable that some European markets were being closed to American meat . Rights explosion <p> The nationalization of our lives has taken many forms , and the nationalization of politics has proceeded apace . However , the change that made government not merely big but also bad for the nation 's soul was a change of mind . Ideas have consequences and today 's government is one of them . <p> The Constitution 's framers believed that individuals are endowed with natural rights essential to the pursuit of happiness and that governments are instituted to secure those rights , not to secure happiness . But life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ethos of limits , of any sort . It had been hoped that potentially disruptive passions might be tamed by being diverted from factional politics into commerce . It had been hoped that dangerous energies would be sublimated in wealth creation and acquisition . But what was to prevent acquisitive people from coming to regard government as just another arena in which they could strive for material well-being ? Nothing was to prevent that , because the nation was to abandon the Constitution 's underlying ideas , and because some new ideas were to encourage actively the conception of government as deliverer of material well-being . <p> In October , 1932 , the Democratic party 's presidential nominee said , " I have . . . described the spirit of my program as a ' new deal , ' which is plain English for a changed concept of the duty and responsibility of government toward economic life . " Said Franklin Roosevelt , " Government has a final responsibility for the well-being of its citizens . " Thus was the final responsibility for much of life removed from private life to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Potomac . And thus was the " well-being " of the citizen defined with reference to material conditions , and without reference to the citizen 's character or virtues . <p> In his second inaugural address , FDR spoke of government 's responsibilities toward " the one-third of a nation ill-housed , ill-clad and ill-nourished . " Toward the end of his presidency , he claimed for government a responsibility that would still further enlarge its sphere . In his January 1944 State of the Union message , he avowed a government " duty " to establish " an American standard of living higher than ever before known , " and he said : " We can not be content , no matter how high that general standard of living may be , if some fraction of our people  --  whether it be one-third or one-fifth or one-tenth  --  is ill-fed , ill-clothed , ill-housed or insecure . " <p> This was a summons to permanent discontent on the part of citizens and government . This was the bestowing on government of a roving commission to define civic health solely in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to add to the growing list of citizens ' entitlements an entitlement to a mental state  --  a sense of security . Roosevelt said political rights would no longer suffice to insure " equality in the pursuit of happiness , " so there must be a " second Bill of Rights . " It would include rights to " a useful and remunerative job , " " adequate " food , clothing , and recreation , " good " education , " decent " homes , a " decent " living for farmers , " adequate " medical care , and a right to freedom from " unfair competition " and from " the economic fears of old age , sickness , accident , and unemployment . " <p> All these rights , and myriad others that would be enumerated as the years rolled by , were necessary , Roosevelt said , because " necessitous men are not free men . " Therefore , government 's new task would be nothing less than the conquest of necessity . And so , 20 years later , in 1964 , at the Democratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had been in Washington since Roosevelt was president and who planned to complete Roosevelt 's project  --  the elimination of necessity from Americans ' lives . Lyndon Johnson said to the 1964 Convention : " This Nation  --  this generation  --  in this hour , has man 's first chance to build the Great Society  --  a place where the meaning of man 's life matches the marvels of man 's labor . " It was going to be hard to top that entitlement  --  the entitlement to meaningfulness . <p> But 20 years after that , the Democratic party gave its presidential nomination to Walter Mondale , perhaps the last nominee to adhere to New Deal liberalism or , at least , the last not to disguise his adherence . In his concession statement after losing 49 states , Mondale said his thoughts were with all those in need of caring government , including " the poor , the unemployed , the elderly , the handicapped , the helpless and the sad . " Yes , the sad . Sadness , too , like necessity , qualified as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that liberalism annihilated all sense of limits on government 's responsibilities and competence ? James Q. Wilson has said that New Deal liberalism was concerned only  --  only !  --  with who gets what , when , where , and how ; but liberalism in its new phase was concerned with who thinks what , who acts when , who lives where , and who feels how . Especially if you feel insecure . Or sad . <p> In President Johnson 's 1965 speech at Howard University , which adumbrated the rationale for what has come to be called affirmative action , he said " men are shaped by their world . " That is certainly true . Johnson also said people are shaped by " a hundred unseen forces . " That also is true . But what was new was the idea that government could and should master all forces , the unseen and the seen , and , for that matter , should master " the world . " The planted axiom was that , because government frames society , government is complicit in , and hence morally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come out right . <p> But this notion erases the very distinction on which classical liberalism  --  the liberalism of Locke and the American Revolution  --  was founded , the distinction between the public and the private spheres of life . On this distinction , freedom depends . Never mind . Government set out to " level the playing field . " That recurring phrase is revealing : Playing fields are leveled by bulldozers  --  which are not nice emblems of government . <p> The result of government 's equalizing aspirations is a paradox-power wielded by elites claiming expertise in the manufacture of equality . In its attempt to equalize " well-being , " liberalism exalted one virtue  --  compassion . And compassion is a capacious concept . It can mean the prevention or amelioration of pain , of discomfort , of insecurity , or even of sadness . However , the frustration of desires is uncomfortable and can make people sad . So compassionate government must toil for the satisfaction of all desires . If a desire unfulfilled is painful , or even a discomfort , fulfilling that desire is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pain of unfulfilled desires makes fulfilling the desires necessary . So the desires are upgraded to necessities . People suffering disappointed desires are therefore necessitous people , and , according to Franklin Roosevelt , necessitous people are not free . Representation rightly understood <p> Now , what moderation , what temperance , what restraint can there be in government animated by the idea that freedom , understood as emancipation from necessity , is the gift of comprehensively compassionate government ? Such government has metastasized recklessly , and conservatism has risen on the tide of reaction against such government 's hubris and overreaching . But life in this target-rich environment has been a bit too easy for conservatism . With so many lurid faults to liberalism , conservatism has not had to ask itself some hard questions about what it is prepared to tell people , especially people that would rather not be told . <p> Again , limited government can not be attained by getting the judiciary to put the political branches on a short leash . The judiciary will not do that , and conservatives should not incite the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has seized . Limited government can only be attained by shifting the shiftable sands of public opinion . So the central political problem for conservatives is to get the public to consent to government that censors their desires , refusing to fulfill many of them . <p> However , in order for popular government to be strong enough to say " no " to popular desires , it must be respected . And if our constitutional government is to be respected , the Constitution must be regarded as something more , something grander , than a mere framework for competing forms of willfulness . The conservative agenda of governmental restraint depends on government having the strength that comes from respect . And respect is never accorded to the servile . <p> So conservatives must drop their populist rhetoric about making government more " responsive . " And they must abandon their populist posture , which has them living with their ears to the ground . As Churchill said , it is hard to look up to someone in that position . <p> Now that conservatives are convinced that they are riding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conservatives to think their mission is merely to remove impediments to popular opinion . However , their real mission is ( in the language of The Federalist ) to " enlarge and refine " opinion . Is that an elitist thought ? Of course . But the question , now as always , is not whether elites shall rule , but which elites . Republics rely on the principle of representation , which is that the people do not decide issues  --  they decide who shall decide . And they decide by elections , not by drawing lots . Elections , unlike lotteries , are searches for certain special and scarce attributes . The attributes of worthy representatives involve more than a willingness to represent the public merely by re-presenting the public 's opinions back to itself . <p> Representation , properly practiced , involves responsibilities entailed by this fact : Public opinion rarely really exists independent of government actions and deliberations . Conservatives may be most comfortable taking the anti-constitutional position that politics is just the task of conforming policies to a particular set of interests . But if that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from liberals is the interests on whose behalf they want government to be " responsive . " <p> Is there a tension between the idea of government based on consent and the idea of representation somewhat independent of opinion ? Of course there is . But that tension is built into our regime ; it is constitutional tension . The tension is inherent in the idea of popular government operating at a constitutional distance from the populace that legitimizes government by its consent . The tension is inherent in the idea that the deliberations of representative government will " refine and enlarge " the public mind . The tension is inherent in the idea of constitutional government as a formative experience  --  government as both agent and shaper of the people . Constitutional virtues <p> Our nation had a founding moment , which means it is founded on more than inertia . Our nation emerged not from forces obscured by the mists of the past but from a clear , public act of choosing . Of the correctness of their choice , the Founders were breathtakingly confident . Think about this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Founders thought that religious truth was unknowable and so must remain an open question . But the Constitution guarantees the establishment of republican governments in all the states because the Founders considered the best form of government a closed question for our open society . <p> One measure of a political philosophy 's seriousness is what it requires of its adherents . Conservatives today are required to tell people that they should be formed by respect for the Constitution . That is , they should be formed for a life of choosing not to choose all that government can offer , because those offerings come at a cost to the virtues of independence and moderation . <p> Which brings us back to what may be the cultural contradiction of conservatism : Conservatism depends on eliciting from citizens a public-spirited self-denial . But that is not easily elicited in a commercial republic of the sort conservatism celebrates , where individualism enjoys maximum scope for private pursuits . <p> Public-spirited self-denial can only be elicited by a conservatism standing for more than the sum of the demands of the groups in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Constitution and , hence , for the virtues of self-reliance and self-restraint that our polity presupposes . As today 's conservative party struggles to develop a constitutional vocabulary for infusing self-government with self-restraint , it should remember this : The party first became a national factor because of one man 's refusal to accept popular sovereignty as a complete expression of the formative project of American politics . That is , the Republican party 's intellectual pedigree traces directly to Lincoln 's denial that Kansans could choose to have slaves . <p> Lincoln 's noble insistence was that a great continental nation could be , indeed had to be , a single moral community . Conservatism 's task today is to demonstrate that the dignity of constitutional government depends on restraints of a sort that do not come easily to conservatives or any other Americans . And these restraints will not come automatically or spontaneously from institutional arrangements  --  from federalism or judicial review . The restraints requisite for limited government , and hence requisite for the citizens ' virtues that republican government presupposes , will come only as expressions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reverence that not only honors the memory of the Founders but is thoughtful in understanding their principles . <p> The search for restraint is an American constant . It is a search in which liberalism is not helpful . Liberalism was born when the primary enemies of freedom were forces of order  --  oppressive governments and established churches . Hence liberalism 's breezy faith that the good life would flourish when the last king had been strangled in the entrails of the last priest . Today , we know it is not that simple ; we know that the good life is menaced by forces of disorder and that big government has become one of those forces . <p> Fortunately , conservatism is on the case in the 1990s . We shall see if conservatism can give constitutional dignity to its message . One thing already is clear . In the 1990s , as in the 1850s and the 1790s , America can not be accused of living an unexamined life . The exhilaration and the essential goodness of our politics flow from the fact that we had a founding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resulted in documents  --  the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution  --  the construing of which will drive our national conversation as long as we are recognizably the nation they founded . And we shall long endure . <p> This article is based on the author 's Francis Boyer Lecture , delivered at the annual dinner of the American Enterprise Institute on December 6 , 1995 . <p> By GEORGE F.
