1 DANCING AT LUGHNASA ( Broadway ) . <P> The best ensemble cast since Nicholas Nickleby , performing the most elegant and rueful memory play since Broadway Bound , if not The Glass Menagerie . In a weary and mutually tolerant Irish family of five sisters and a brother , playwright Brian Friel finds a whole world , pagan and Christian , ancient and modern , savage and sedate . Through a lifetime of theatergoing , one would be lucky to see acting any better than this . <P> 2 . LOST IN YONKERS ( Broadway ) . <P> A superb tragicomedy in which Neil Simon unflinchingly revisits the time in his childhood when he and his brother had to live as humbled supplicants among richer relatives ( an episode more sentimentally imagined in his 1983 Brighton Beach Memoirs ) . In Grandma Kurnitz ( Irene Worth ) , Simon brilliantly plumbs the sadistic soul of stoic , rugged individualism . <P> 3 . MISS SAIGON ( Broadway ) . <P> Musical storytelling gets no better than this tragic tale of lovers divided by the end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gulf between the U.S. and the Third World . As a Vietnamese hustler and would-be American , Britain 's Jonathan Pryce gave the performance of the year in a reprise of his West End triumph . <P> 4 . THE SECRET GARDEN ( Broadway ) . <P> Sweet and sentimental and , yes , a little slow , this adaptation of a beloved children 's book is gorgeous and Freudianly evocative to look at , melodic and poignant to hear , innocent and hugely satisfying in its emotional climax . The only worthwhile American musical of 1991 . <P> 5 . FORGIVING TYPHOID MARY ( George Street Playhouse , New Brunswick , N.J. ) . <P> This true story of the woman who unwittingly spread a lethal epidemic lifted documentary into poetry . Mark St. Germain 's play , part fevered memory , part aborted repentance , was hauntingly staged by artistic director Gregory S. Hurst on a painterly landscape blending hospital confines with the lonely beauty of the dunes . As Mary , Estelle Parsons blazed in denial . <P> 6 . UNIDENTIFIED HUMAN REMAINS AND THE TRUE NATURE OF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick , affectless riffs and crosscuts of action in an ambisexual world of AIDS , serial killers and arrestingly etched violence . Playwright Brad Fraser 's theme was the anomie that makes it easier to couple in the dark than to voice one 's feelings . His underlying mantra : " Everybody lies . " <P> 7 . THE OLD BOY/THE SNOW BALL ( off-Broadway/Huntington Theater , Boston ) . <P> A.R . Gurney has moved from lacerating the Wasp world he came from ( The Dining Room , The Middle Ages ) to exploring his own guilts in this pair of pieces about the disquiets and discontents of his generation . The Old Boy laments unthinking bigotry toward homosexuals . The Snow Ball yearns for bygone male authority and apparent female contentment with it . <P> 8 . WHEN WE DEAD AWAKEN ( Harvard and Houston ) . <P> Ibsen might not have recognized his valedictory in Robert Wilson 's visually spectacular and verbally stripped-down version . But this directorial coup of the year reinforced Wilson 's nonpareil standing as a sculptor of stage space . <P> 9 . FROM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
