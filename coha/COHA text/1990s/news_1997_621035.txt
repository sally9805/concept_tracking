<p> To be a celebrity is one thing ; to be a leader is another . And 18 months after San Francisco residents voted him into office , Willie Brown still has n't shown he has what it takes to be a great mayor . <p> A good mayor , yes . A powerful mayor , absolutely . An exuberant mayor whose style fits his pleasure-loving city , without a doubt . <p> But for all his love of the limelight , Brown shows no interest in crafting a long-range approach to such challenges as making public transit run on time . Instead , he careens from day to day , speech to speech , meeting to meeting . He is the mayor of high drama , problem-solver du jour . <p> Which is fine as far as it goes . But to make a deeper impact , politicians must chart a course as well as command a stage . Brown has n't done that . <p> That 's a high standard to set for a first-term mayor , but Brown sets that standard for himself . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in town . His rhetoric is the stuff of colossal dreams . <p> " I am clearly more ambitious than most ( mayors ) have ever been , " Brown proclaimed after he took office . One week later he said this was his goal : Should Martin Luther King Jr . someday return to Earth , " the only place he would be comfortable living would be San Francisco . " <p> The core of Brown 's campaign for mayor was the promise of strong leadership  --  and he had a record to point to . During 15 years as speaker of the California Assembly , Brown wrote the rules and pulled the strings . <p> The difference in San Francisco is that Brown 's audience is 715,000 residents . Success is measured by how lives are changed , not by such gestures as creating a task force or issuing a proclamation . <p> Too often , Brown acts as if he is still in Sacramento . He makes a gesture and then moves on . <p> That was the case last winter when Brown hosted a job fair for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at some point during the day . " I hope this gives people hope that there 's someone out there who cares , " Brown said solemnly . <p> Last month , a reporter from a neighborhood paper went back to check the results  --  and found that only eight people had new jobs . More than 10,000 applications had n't even been processed . Brown 's idea was good , but there was no follow-through . And he did n't bother with the details . <p> Or consider two promises made in Brown 's first speech as mayor . <p> Appearing before a luncheon of Union Square retailers , Brown said he wanted high school students to serve as pages in City Hall 's lobby , and he vowed that within 72 hours he would unveil a plan to fix Muni . <p> The student pledge came true  --  visit City Hall during the school year and you see teenagers sitting behind a counter with little to do , wearing blazers donated by Macy 's . The Muni plan ? Brown was playing a prank on the media , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there 's little evidence that Brown sees any profound difference between dressing up youth in blazers and fixing a $ 306 million transit system . <p> The buses are a bit cleaner and safer . Ridership is up slightly after four years of decline . But buses still arrive on whim , and there 's still raw tension among riders and drivers and management . <p> Brown has n't moved to soothe this . Instead , he periodically announces that things are better  --  while relations between the unions ( Brown backers ) and the director ( a Brown appointee ) are so bad that a wildcat strike almost took place last month . <p> When he ran for mayor , Brown held up Muni as a symbol of the city 's ills . Looking back , his pledge to make the system run on time " if I have to drive the bus myself " was n't just bravado . It was naivete . <p> Naivete is possibly the last word one would link with Willie Brown . But the recent 49ers stadium campaign suggests that in some very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The measures necessary to build a $ 525 million stadium and shopping mall barely won approval from voters . In large part , this was because Brown never grasped two basic truths about San Francisco : A lot of people do n't like big development , and they do n't like giving money to a sports team . <p> But Brown was clearly caught off guard , and his invariably indignant reactions chewed away precious votes at the margin . <p> " Why are they skeptical ? Because they 've been listening to you guys , " Brown snarled to reporters at one point . <p> It 's as if Brown was proud of himself for cutting a clever deal , and he could n't figure out why everyone would n't go along . <p> Thanks to political hustle by the mayor  --  and a $ 2 million campaign by the 49ers  --  the proposal eked out 50.4 percent of the vote . But the stumbling drive was a shock to observers familiar with the smooth way Brown wielded power in Sacramento . <p> " The stadium campaign did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Richardson , a Sacramento Bee reporter who last year published a 503-page biography of Brown . " He did n't seem to be in control . " <p> None of this is to deny Brown his due : He is good at what he does . When backroom action is needed  --  convincing business leaders this week to try to provide 2,000 jobs for welfare recipients or negotiating a quick end to an April garbage strike  --  nobody is better . <p> He looks good in the open , too : His easy eloquence and clear intelligence make him a natural in the role of chief executive . There 's an attractiveness to his determination to create job opportunities and bring a diversity of people into leadership positions . <p> It all adds up to high poll numbers at home and simpering coverage from the national press . Newsweek put him on the cover even as it confessed : " His tangible accomplishments so far are modest relative to the wave of good feelings his administration has generated . . . What makes him a political magician is simply being Willie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a magician is n't enough . When the novelty wears off , people expect more than a good show . <p> In sizing up American politicians , editor Alan Ehrenhalt of Governing magazine suggests that a common trait of first-rank mayors or governors is that they keep focused . However much they revel in daily battle , they never lose sight of their targets . <p> " The best ones set up objectives and find a way to achieve them , " Ehrenhalt said . " You want to be practical and tough , but you need to have a sense of where you want to go . " <p> That 's the missing piece for the 63-year-old Brown , suggests his biographer . <p> " He is so caught up in the present , " Richardson said . " There 's no overarching goal beyond ' I 'll get stuff done and be entertaining and make you feel good . ' " <p> Richardson sees little in Brown 's past to suggest that the style will change in this subtly difficult new role . <p> " With Willie Brown , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politicians , " Richardson said . " For them it 's all motion , no introspection ; they delight in the contest . They do n't sit around thinking big thoughts . " <p> WILLIE BROWN <p> . <p> HOMELESSNESS <p> This is the city 's thorniest social problem ; Brown 's solution has been to ignore it except when asked . Fortunately for him , homelessness is old news  --  despite the misery people living on the street might face , the media and the public have lost interest . C- <p> . <p> BUSINESS CLIMATE <p> Brown is a born CEO , and big business loves that . He also revived the Mission Bay project  --  first by making it a priority , then by making sure UCSF would build a new campus there . But again , Brown excels at seizing opportunities rather than setting an agenda . A- <p> . <p> PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION <p> Brown was a demagogue on this in 1995 , acting as if a new mayor is all it would take to fix a long-troubled system . Now Brown 's the mayor , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a notch for overblown promises . C- <p> . <p> QUALITY OF LIFE <p> This is a man who cares about how he looks and how things look around him . What this translates to citywide is a desire for clean streets , attractive street furniture and a general sense of style . And employees know it , so progress actually is being made . B+ <p> . <p> CRIME <p> Crime rates are down , which is good , and there have n't been any major problems in terms of new scandals . But this does n't seem to be one of Brown 's interests , and he rarely intervenes unless circumstances dictate . B- <p> . <p> POLITICAL SKILL <p> Brown knows when to thunder in public and when to make a discreet phone call . He 's so powerful that other politicos try to avoid even the appearance of conflict . But sometimes he gets into political spats for the sheer heck of it , distracting himself and the city from other issues . A- <p> . <p> LEADERSHIP <p> The word " leadership " was central to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense that his forceful hand and magnetic style are present everywhere . He makes things happen . The question is , where is this leadership leading  --  if anywhere at all ? B- <p> CORRECTION-DATE : JUNE 23 , 1997 , MONDAY , FINAL EDITION <p> CORRECTION : An article on Mayor Willie Brown in the June 20 issue of The Chronicle incorrectly stated the population of San Francisco . It is about 778,000 . The Chronicle regrets the error .
