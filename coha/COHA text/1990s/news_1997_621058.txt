<p> Looking for glamorous decor with a light touch ? Longing for modern textiles with tongue-in- cheek charm ? <p> New sheer fabrics  --  lightweight yet highly decorative  --  can make even the most uptight room look fancy-free . Diaphanous polyester , cotton or linen voiles and open- weave cotton blends are , for the moment , the darlings of the design world . <p> Woven in a multitude of artful fibers , the newest Californian and European woven textiles are like a breath of fresh air . <p> The newest arrivals will be on display this week in San Francisco Design Center showrooms for the biannual , trade-only California Summer Market ' 97 , starting Friday . <p> Showrooms will be filled with samples of the luscious new see- through drapery fabrics . Suddenly , heavy fabrics seem dowdy , old hat and ponderous . For this season , overly elaborate chintzes and heavy tapestries feel overwrought and complicated . Sheers simply look modern . <p> " The time is right for the pure , sensory experience of these new , light-filtering sheers , " said Sherri @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Sheers are so versatile and mutable in decor . They can be exotic , glamorous or ethereal , or can look pleasantly plain and simple . Undyed handwoven silks may have a sophisticated country look , or can look very elegant in a city apartment . " <p> Donghia has just introduced new linen , silk and cotton sheers , along with its handsome " Gates of Venice " and " Sleight of Hand " collections . All are drapey and luxurious , and the silken surfaces change with the light . <p> Donghia 's " Abracadabra " silk shantung , inspired by spices of Tangier and Jaipur , comes in nine delicious colors , including peppery tones and cinnamon . The company 's " Summer Squall " sheer linen is available in sage , ecru , oatmeal , toast and gold . <p> Randolph &; Hein Textiles offers some of the most glamorous new sheers . They are simple and chic , with no razzmatazz . " Anturia , " in acetate and polyester with gold metal threads and a shimmering surface , looks like clouds of gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stitched cotton tracery of flowers and leaves . <p> Perhaps prettiest and most versatile is its " Plissee " sheer , a white polyester/polyamide blend , in glistening Fortuny-like pleats . The silklike fabric would make draperies as beautiful as a ball gown . <p> " Comet , " from the Nya Nordiska Collection , has rich , gleaming gold " coins " floating on a plain white organza of polyester and polyamide . <p> Even New York-based Schumacher , admired for its updated and very practical traditional designs , has got into the swing of sheers . <p> Its new " Buccina " stripe in rayon and silk is especially rich with its substantial texture and the look of raw silk . Schumacher 's new " Mughalai Plaid , " in pure cotton , updates traditional Indian handwoven Madras fabrics with its spicy colors ( curry , pepper ) and its matte and shiny plaids . <p> Best of all , sheers work well as companions to pure linens , simple cotton twills and lightweight woven wool . There 's not a heavy-woven silk or a chenille that would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SHEERS <p> The most innovative new sheer textiles are diaphanous , often semi- transparent , and as mysterious as wisps of fog on a sunny day . At the window , they 're a mere suggestion of color . <p> Rogers &; Goffigon has introduced a filmy cotton inspired by men 's handkerchiefs . Some of the Connecticut-based company 's newest sheers are so fine and lightweight that they seem to disappear when held up to the light . <p> But the range of styles of new sheers is extraordinary . Some companies ' designs are like woven copper and pewter . Others weave fabrics extravagantly appliqued with Lurex and silken threads for a glamorous and very modern look . Even open- weave linens and cottons look very sophisticated , direct and refreshing . <p> " A window , unless it has a fine view , is a flat wall surface that needs some dressing up , and sheers will do that , " said Rosecrans Baldwin , president of New York-based Bergamo Fabrics , one of the most forward- thinking textile design and manufacturing companies  --  and a pioneer in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mundane product that you had to have in a house for privacy , to a must-have fashion statement , " he said . <p> Bergamo 's sheers are not your grandmother 's sheers . They 're not at all like those obligatory and uninspiring white sheer window coverings meant to preserve decorum . Bergamo 's sheers , made in Italy and Switzerland , benefit from high-tech textile advances . They use metallic fibers , pineapple fibers , linen , viscose and pure wool in daring combinations , and explore new manufacturing techniques with wit and playfulness . <p> DESIGNS AND PATTERNS <p> Clarence House 's " Premiere Vision " is a " clipped " cotton sheer whose swirling patterns are reminiscent of the 1940s wrought-iron designs of Gilbert Poillerat . Nancy Corzine has just released a linen double cloth with " pockets " filled with floating yarns of raffia . <p> London-based Carolyn Quartermaine has made a name for herself with deftly printed silks ornamented with Old World calligraphy . She recently turned her hand to sheers and decorated a sheer silk organza with musical allusions in see-through gold paint . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sonoma-based Rodolph , with designs directed by Cynthia Moller- Racke , is making some of the prettiest sheers . " Starlight , " in linen/polyester/Lurex , has a linen ground with sparkling ribbons crisscrossing the weave . Rodolph 's handsome " Visions , " in 100 percent linen , has an open-weave stripe , and is available in colors such as cloud , sunlit , daybreak , moonshadow , flaxen taupe and spring mist . <p> The company 's new " Revelations , " in 100 percent polyester , is so sheer it is almost invisible , barely tinted with a hint of hues such as sea salt , thyme , peppercorn , rose hip and vanilla bean . <p> Jack Lenor Larsen , based in New York , has always been an innovative designer . His newest introductions include lightweight linen prints , smooth and canvaslike plain fabric , and sensuous sheers that combine shiny and matte stripes . <p> Colors that designers feel passionate about tend to be either rich  --  ruby , marigold , purple , umber , for example  --  or pale and dreamy . If a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for today 's rooms . <p> Designers of sheer fabrics say that " off " colors look freshest . <p> Today 's best tones for drapery fabrics are usually subtle and rich , or have just a hint of a tint . <p> SHEER ENERGY <p> " Europeans have always used interesting sheers , but Americans until now have preferred metal blinds and shades , " said Baldwin . " But sheers are at their best when the wind blows and they look so graceful  --  and metal blinds just rattle . " <p> Designers are finding ways to use even the most experimental fabrics . Bergamo 's most in-demand sheers include both practical white sheer fabrics and fantasy sheers with fluttering " handkerchiefs " of fabric as part of the design , or sheers with Lurex leaves woven in . <p> " Karo " by Bergamo , a dramatic checkerboard-patterned woven sheer of synthetic raffia and cotton in black and beige , could work in an Arts and Crafts room or in an all- white loft . <p> Synthetic fibers , which often look too shiny and crass in opaque @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bergamo has many designs in slick and shiny polyester , which does a very good job of looking like silk or fine cotton . Polyester and other synthetics wo n't fade , rot or sag , a distinct plus in windows with full , all- day sun . <p> WHAT DESIGN TRENDS ARE NEW ? <p> This week , interior designers and retailers will get a preview of newest fabrics and furnishings by hundreds of international manufacturers and designers at the trendsetting California Summer Market . This biannual trade-only show opens Friday at the three San Francisco Design Center complexes , as well as other San Francisco showrooms . <p> Here are some of the new design trends they will be seeing . <p> * Colors : No one color dominates  --  but primaries are hardly to be found . The range of subtle colors , however , is broad . Acid green , tea , Chinese lacquer red , sky blue , ebony , pale taupe , gold , Venetian blue all look new . <p> Donghia 's new fabrics come in faded greens , golden wheat , quicksilver , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Textiles in slightly " off " tones such as gray/green look new , along with yellow/green , green tea . <p> Pale , ethereal colors are also very appealing , especially those off-white tones that manufacturers describe with poetic and quirky soubriquets  --  borax , light rain , tides , oyster , salt , tallow , vapor , cloud , foam , fog and lichen . <p> * Fabrics : Sheers in every natural and manmade fiber  --  from faux raffia to gold mesh , paper , polyester , rayon , linen , wool , silk and synthetics . Imaginative manufacturers and designers are inventing new ways to make sheers interesting  --  with appliques , " eye-lashes " of fringe , embroidered holes , " pockets " filled with silk thread , and even dashes of shiny silver threads and glitzy gold .  --  Furniture with reverence  --  and irreverance  --  for the past : Many furniture designers believe that there is nothing new under the sun so it 's best to simply update classic design . Ingenious designers such as Dakota Jackson , Nancy Corzine and Christian Liagre pay homage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tables , neoclassical chairs and versatile no-particular-period sofas and benches . <p> Other designers , such as Michael Berman , glance back to the ' 30s or ' 40s and update glamorous upholstered chairs and simply silhouetted tables . <p> * Transcultural style : Any heavy-handed design that can instantly be labeled  --  Hollywood Glamour , French Country , English Country , Tuscan , for example  --  is probably old hat , and is certainly cliched . The most interesting , fresh and up-to-the-moment design draws on a rich and varied range of influences . <p> Today furniture or textile design that is one-note or one-dimensional tends to feel and look unsatisfying . In fact , the best design bypasses themes and mere reproduction in favor of a transcultural mix . <p> * Diverse influences : Companies such as Ironies , furniture designers such as Peter Gutkin of San Francisco , and design companies such as Leavitt-Weaver of Modesto range wide for ideas , suggestions , echoes of the past and inspiration that resonates . <p> They find influences from an ever-changing collection of international sources . Some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designer Jean-Michel Frank , French design master Jacques-Emil Ruhlmann , ancient Rome , Japanese craftsmanship , fleamarkets , white ironstone , ' 30s French cabinetmakers and ironworkers , traditional tiles and paintings of the Middle East , provincial France , Early Americana , Renaissance Italy for colors and textures , Gothic and Gothic Revival , and any neoclassical period . <p> IRONIES PARTNERS FORGE NEW DIRECTIONS <p> Over the past eight years , partners Brad Huntzinger of Oakland and Kate McIntyre of Sausalito have become well known in the interior design world for their handmade collection of romantic iron beds and poetic iron tables and chairs . <p> Their 50-piece Ironies collection now includes faux-bamboo iron four-poster beds , a variety of coffee tables and occasional chairs , and Venetian-style lighting , as well as painted wood armoires and dressers . <p> Ironies ' timeless cast-stone tabletops are handcrafted in a variety of designs . Some recall ancient Rome and contemporary Provence . Others look to nature for inspiration and replicate shells , ferns and old botanical paintings . <p> For California Summer Market ' 97 , the two designers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detailing , and new wallpapers . Their highly original designs are among this summer market 's standouts . <p> New pieces include the oval- shaped " Lattice Pattern " shelf table with faux bamboo iron legs . <p> One new table , with an inlaid cast-stone top , looks like an antique Japanese game table  --  as if indigo , gold and burgundy faux mah-jongg pieces have been inlaid into ebonized stone . The new Ironies slumped- glass Venetian-style chandelier has an iron twig framework , creamy glass shade and jewel-like , hand- blown beads decorating the iron links that attach it to the ceiling . <p> RESOURCES <p> All of these showrooms are located in the San Francisco Design Center , 2 Henry Adams St. ( near the intersection of Division , Townsend and Eighth streets ) , San Francisco ; ( 415 ) 864-1500 .
