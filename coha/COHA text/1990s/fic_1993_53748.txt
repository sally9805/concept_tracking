for John Casey It is only ever about power , see . Pick the crowd and pick your vantage point , then watch . Learn the con , you have to learn to look for what does not originate in ordinary . Hats will tow you in ; and shoes . One good hour on watched shoes you learn the lessons of lost civilizations . Hats and bald men , true , the classic duo , followed only by plain women and red fingernails , women who 've been told their hands are pretty , or their hands are soft , or their hands are like those hands that handle anything and everything expressively from toilet rolls to dog food on TV for money . Do n't let yourself ignore the shoes . Do n't discount feet , in general . In men you want to look for loafers , and you want to educate your eye for size . Disregard the loafered foot beyond size twelve , it is not the well-heeled secret . People , even men , of big feet do not cultivate a secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always do . Men with small feet have been told for years they have " nice " feet by shoe clerks and by women , guaranteed , and they 've allowed this praise , innocuous as rice , to lodge somewhere in the tooth that butts the tooth that makes the inward grin of what we call Conceit , the pearly grit of our existence , cleansed by ego , licked by love , the untaxed vice , the syntax of the self expressing self , the secret vanity , and we each and every one of us has at least a single one , a pair of pretty hands , small feet , small wrists , some aspect of our forehead not dissimilar to Garbo 's or to Einstein 's , name it . Name it , please . Find it and you own that person . Spot it and you 're in . It 's voodoorama time and I 'm so good at it they ought to elevate me onto postage , paste my face on stamps , food stamps . I 'm onto something here with this lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for stops , when what should happen but old trouble hauls his ass on like unbonded freight , sees me , spots the con , and takes a crucial place not letting on he 's interrupting Diz . The doodah man . The mentholated small craft warning . Voodoo wizard . What the hell you doing on my bus I let him know by looking , but the law of shared existence mediates between us . One man 's bus is still another one 's performance space , so hey . Streets , you either love them or you hate them , like the theater ; like church . Meanwhile this lady 's twisting in her seat as Diz skids in , trying to inhale the flesh of her own nose , sucking in her nostrils in that **25;116;TOOLONG kind of way . " People and they 's food , " I throw to Diz . " See you clocking and they think you after they 's brown bag . " <p> " Zatso , " Diz muses . <p> " Court disaster to protect they 's food . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " Mmm ? " <p> " They 's babies . " <p> Diz teaches you that you need to learn to love what feeds you , lick the streets or they lick you . Diz has been a Village indigent since Nixon , has a union card , and he can state his numbers , veteran 's , tax , probation , zip , phone , date of discharge , dosage , sun 's diameter . I think he said once he was from Kentucky , but he allows you to believe he 's from the state you 're from . Sure I know where that is , he can say about a hometown , any hometown , I 'd always wish I 'd been from there , in case your vanity is place . " California Girl " will still rekindle glimmers in a certain kind of woman , and Eurotrash still pay for Euro-fawning , but vanity as place is not the vanity it used to be upon these shores . What do I ask ? Diz stakes . Spare change . What do I give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streets is a philosopher . The System , Diz explains , is just another cardboard box . The gates of heaven are two heating grates , a city thanks its dwellers with a gift of ample gratefulness . Baths , a dime . Baths , two bits with towel . Baths , two dollars , own your soap . When did beggars turn into " The Homeless , " when did everybody ever have a home , you take a nation by the neck and shake it you can hear its secret vanity inSide . Prosperity  --  where the hell did all these poor come from , send in the Marines , send flares up , son , the sky is falling , folks are landing in your yards . Let the dogs loose , boy , and call for backup . All we have to do is look into your secret vanity , as through a windowpane and , Flynn , guess what , we 're in . The poor of any nation own no vanity . The poor of any nation are not vain . A duck can beg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chicken with a brain not even half the size of its own gizzards , monkeys beg , and cats and dogs and carp in ponds , but only humans beg from their own species , only humans trade their labor , openly , for food . Or trade a smile for change . Or trade a word for bread . Or trade a promise , or a trick . A city does not shelter like an ancient keep , sleep takes the form of prison , you can die in it . If only we was wolves , Diz says . I 'd marry you , that simple . I 'd rather we was fish , I state . Big fish ? Diz baits . Full and high and silvery , I paint . Diz messes in my drift . Did you say " high " ? he feints . His hands are large , his hands are huge , and Baby Hands was what he called me when I started hanging on his corner . He watched to see if that could put a blush on me but he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vain about my hands . My hands are small but I 'm not vain about them . I 'm not vain about my feet and they are smallish , too , he could have called me Baby Feet or Baby Shoes , if I had shoes . I 'm not vain about my hair , if I have hair , and I 'm not vain about my looks if I have any . I 'm not vain about my children rest their souls and I 'm not vain about accomplishments . I 'm not vain about this way I dress . I 'm not vain for graduating high school or for running track . I 'm not vain for kissing Mikey Dorwart in the seventh grade . I 'm not vain for hard scrabble and scramble egg the special way I fry or vain about the kitchen things I could remember if I wanted to or vain about my pussy vain about the fact I never cry and won a prize in English named for William Faulkner worth ten dollars cash . I 'm not vain about the things that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rises and hopes fall . Walk out on a man one day and soon somebody calls out pretty lady , pretty darling , strut that stuff this way , no references ; a scrap . Even if you do n't drink everyone you meet is either crazy with religion or a drug , or righteous with possession of a certified philosophy about the virtue of hard work . Even if you have your health your looks will go , ca n't make it in the rural what you have a car and someone tells you jobs are waiting in the population centers , and the point about the point from which you always start is that you 'd never do it if you knew how you are gon na end . You think , This is only temporary . This is just a setback . I 'll wait here until I 'm warmer . Even if you keep your shoes your legs will blister . People 's lives go downhill for as many reasons as there are to count and you can count on no one , Diz will tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole unholy truth . The streets are n't any place for women , you ought to get into a shelter , Baby Hands , go back to your Southern heaven , Diz directs . <p> " Diz ; I hiss . " Your inconvenient self is sitting between me and dinner . " <p> " Ca n't be helped , " he says . <p> " I 'm flirtin ' . " <p> " Not with me , I 'm fixed . " <p> " Every person who is broke believe she fixed , " he taunts . <p> People acting like you 're not exactly sleeping in their walking space . People making detours all around you . People looking scared and challenged by your empties . This is where I live , my memory my walls , my bones my stairs , my stares my windows my facade . This is me upon my picket fence the mortgage paid the lawn well waged , the wickets , gravel and magnolia , rice and beans a chicken in the pot a light on in the window , cedar shake and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accident and casualty , a priest will come to bless this house a house is not a home a home is where the heart is , home is where your vanity is hidden . I look at Diz 's hands . The lady in the seat in front of us is gathering her bags , twisting to avoid the sight of us , her back a statement of her rigid purpose . And Diz 's hands are fucking huge , those pitchblack frostbit fingertips , a broken tooth , a face increased by weather , hard to say why some stay as they are , but that 's the nature of a monument , it never moves . That 's the nature of a fairy tale , it never changes . <p> The lady stands and I stand , too , which makes her look at me , a trick Diz taught me , make them think you 're going to follow them and they will turn toward you unconsciously an instant to assess the threat and right when she is staring at me I sit down again and smile and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Could n't help but hearing you were humming , " I stage-whisper and I shake my head a little , like a gourd in a mariachi band , never letting her release her gaze , I lean in closer , hesitate , and then I say , " I bet you used to be the best one in the choir . . . . Do n't you , Diz ? " <p> " Without a doubt , " the doodah man recounts . <p> I wish you could have seen what comes into her eyes . <p> She starts with five and ends with twenty . <p> Someone once , when she was young , had said her voice could bring down Heaven . <p> " I always fancied I could sing , " she 's saying , fussing with the wallet . <p> Here , take this . <p> And take this , too . <p> It 's the sandwich I was going to have for lunch . <p> You 'll like it . <p> It 's brisket . <p> Two stops later Diz says , " Baby , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting on and I say , Diz , you doodah man . Hand me that glass slipper . <p> <p> <p> By MARIANNE WIGGINS <p>
