<p> Your Feb. 10 editorial is completely off target . Advanced practice registered nurses do not want to be , or to replace , doctors . They simply want recognition of their title and the services they already provide . Illinois is the only state that does not recognize APRNs . <p> APRNs  --  nurse practitioners , certified nurse midwives , certified registered nurse anesthetists and clinical nurse specialists  --  provide high-quality , cost-effective care , and always in collaboration with physicians . We believe patients should be able to choose their health care provider , and never should be denied access to a physician . But denying access to APRNs because of potential cost-motivated abuses by insurance companies or others punishes the patients . <p> Limiting physicians to two or four collaborative agreements with APRNs will seriously limit access to care , particularly in medically underserved urban and rural settings where APRNs often practice . And certainly physicians are capable of making sound decisions regarding collaborative agreements without state mandates . <p> Advanced practice nursing is not new . Nurse midwifery and nurse anesthesia date back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began more than 30 years ago . In Illinois , all APRNs are educated at the master 's level or beyond and are nationally certified . It 's time for legislators in Illinois to do what legislators have done in 49 other states  --  recognize advanced practice registered nurses . <p> Linda B. Roberts , <p> M.S.N. , R.N. , president , <p> Illinois Nurses Association <p> A healthier state <p> The Illinois Nurses Association is leading the campaign in amending the Illinois Nurses Act specific to the practice of certified nurse-midwives , certified registered nurse anesthetists , nurse practitioners and clinical nurse specialists . <p> These four groups represent advanced practice registered nurses . The proposed changes to the nursing statute include title recognition and prescriptive authority . These changes will help improve the " health " of health care in Illinois . Title recognition will clarify our roles as providers . There will not be any need to leave titles " up to interpretation " if the statue clearly defines the subgroups of APRNs . This change also will facilitate benefit coverage by insurance companies . <p> APRNs diagnose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The ability to prescribe medications appropriate to the APRNs ' scope of practice allows the delivery of comprehensive care and services ; . <p> The New York Times , as recently as 1997 , cited a professional journal article comparing the safety and satisfaction of obstetric care provided by obstetrician ; gynecologists , family practice physicians and CNMs . The findings were in favor of CNMs  --  the care was found to be safe , cost-effective and most satisfactory by the women who participated in the study . <p> You are absolutely right when you say that patients deserve to have confidence in their provider . Where there is disagreement is in the definition of provider . Physicians are well-respected in the nursing community  --  in general practice and the practice of APRNs . <p> However , physicians are not the only authority on medical science . There are many overlaps in the practice of medicine and nursing . Any patient or client who has had the benefit of both providers can speak to this issue , and some of these people prefer APRNs to physician care . <p> APRNs are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's physical exam . APRNs do that and much more . APRNs are nurses with postgraduate degrees , advanced training and certification in their area of expertise . <p> Jean M. Borrelli , C.N.M. , M.S. , <p> Partners in Women 's <p> Health Care , Oak Park <p> Try some fruit juice <p> I found Dr. Kenneth Walker 's pro-milk story ( Health and Fitness Section , Jan. 18 ) to be not only outrageously inaccurate , but also grossly irresponsible . <p> Walker recommended that children be given whole milk until they are at least 18 . He maintains that obsessively fat-conscious adults are putting their children in jeopardy by giving them lowfat alternatives . Walker writes in his article , " They believe that what is good for adults is also good for children . " <p> Actually the error lies in the misguided belief that what is good for a baby cow is good for humans . Milk is a natural product designed to nurture babies . We are the only species that takes the milk of another animal and consumes it all our lives . Cow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which can ultimately weigh 500 pounds . Small wonder we are a nation of overweight people ! <p> Amanda Solon , Edgewater <p> Examine the positive <p> Regarding Dennis Byrne 's column ( Feb. 5 ) , it 's a pleasant surprise to see a Chicago public school not being blamed for gang-related violence . <p> The school in question , Seward Communication Arts Academy , is well-known for its excellent programs and high level of community involvement , qualities thankfully acknowledged in Byrne 's column . <p> However , I do have one question : Why is a fine school like Seward considered newsworthy only when something negative happens ? <p> Bill Dal Cerro , West Town <p> Fortunes of war <p> " Tet : a no-win debate " ( news story , Feb. 1 ) is interesting history but also fascinating for what it reveals about how our world has changed . Those who say we " kicked the enemy 's ass " point , with justice , to a body count heavily skewed against the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong . But what American president of either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action in which 1,400 Americans died in one week , even to achieve so desirable an outcome as the overthrow of Saddam Hussein ? <p> As to whether we should be celebrating the 30-year anniversary of a victory or lamenting a historic defeat , the matter is best settled by the words of ( Arthur Wellesley , ) the Duke of Wellington : " Nothing except a battle lost can be half so melancholy as a battle won . " <p> Thomas W. Evans , Mundelein <p> A hollow victory <p> Regarding " Deal severs city 's tie to Boy Scouts " ( news story , Feb. 5 ) , our great guardians of freedom , the American Civil Liberties Union , have won a legal victory by having the city stop supporting the Boy Scouts . <p> The ACLU seems to spend a lot of its resources in lawsuits against this organization , which has contributed so much positive to the youth of our nation . I often wonder what the ACLU 's agenda really is and whose interests they are representing . <p> Bruce Wieczorkiewicz , <p> Franklin Park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation to abandon the most basic ethical and moral standards . The Justice Department should disband the public integrity section right away . Nobody cares . <p> This anything-goes , no-taboos , shock-rock pop culture we have now bears no relation to the American experiment created by our Founding Fathers that had led me to once be a proud American . I have never experienced such a darkness in my soul as I do today . <p> John Briatico Jr. , Bensenville <p> City of light <p> After reading Richard Roeper 's comments ( column , Feb. 3 ) about taking down Christmas lights , I must say that I disagree . I keenly enjoy that wonderful display of festive lights people are increasingly showing around the holiday season . Maybe we can reach a point of agreement , old Richard and I , if we stop calling them Christmas lights , and begin to call them Winter lights . <p> So let 's do it . Call us " Bright City , " or something clever . If we do this right , our hog-butcher home could become a beacon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dark of winter . <p> Bruce McKenna , Park Ridge <p> Liturgically correct <p> How significant that Richard Roeper 's ( column , Feb. 3 ) observations on long-term Christmas decorations should appear on Feb. 3 , the day after the Christmas season ended . <p> According to the Christian liturgical calendar , Feb. 2 , Candlemass Day , is the official end of Christmas season . <p> So , as disconcerting as it may be to see Nativity scenes and Santas on display a month after the holiday , in strict liturgical terms these households are within their rights . <p> Nina D. Gaspich , Uptown <p> Joy to the world <p> Unlike Richard Roeper , I find joy in the numerous wreaths , garland strands , light displays and cheerful Christmas messages left up after his Jan. 10 deadline . <p> Maybe I see that Christmas is not just to be celebrated during the rush of the holiday season , but enjoyed throughout the year . That " chilling anachronistic medley " that made Roeper stop and shudder would warm this girl 's heart . It would bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family creating memories that will be cherished for years . <p> So , next time Roeper walks down " the block that time forgot " he should open his eyes and his heart . Maybe then he would see past those decorations he finds so annoying to their real meaning . . . the joy of the birth of Jesus Christ . <p> Michele Kennedy , Clearing
