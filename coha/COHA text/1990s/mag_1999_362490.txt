Military history is a gallimaufry of choices and chance , of opportunities taken , of roads forsaken . <P> It is this truism that drives What If ? ( Putnam ; 305 pages ; $27.95 ) , a collection of essays by 34 military historians , journalists and novelists , all indulging in " counterfactual " conjecture . <P> In 334 B.C. , for example , the 22-year-old Macedonian King Alexander charged with his cavalry into the ranks of Persian forces at the Granicus River in what is now Turkey . A Persian soldier clubbed Alexander with an ax , but before he could deal a second and fatal blow , the King 's bodyguard killed him . <P> What if Alexander had died at Granicus ? Goodbye to all the conquests of Alexander the Great , says Princeton historian Josiah Ober . The Persian Empire would have overtaken the known world . The great promise of Hellenism would have lost its way ; the growing Roman Empire would have atrophied ; Judea would have remained a backwater , Jesus merely " a local religious figure , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been no need for a Martin Luther , no Reformation , no Renaissance , no Enlightenment , no Western culture . <P> In 1944 General Dwight Eisenhower was prepared to invade Normandy on June 5 , but when his weather officer predicted storms over the English Channel , Ike postponed D-day for 24 hours . <P> What if the Channel weather had not abated on June 6 ? World War II chronicler and Eisenhower biographer Stephen Ambrose argues that without air cover and paratrooper support , the first waves of Allied troops would have been incapable of fighting . Eisenhower could not have withdrawn them . Hitler could have held his positions , and Operation Overlord , the master plan for reconquering Europe , would have disintegrated . Ike would have lost his job , the Churchill government could have fallen , and President Franklin Roosevelt might have failed in his bid for a fourth term . <P> Even so , Hitler could not have triumphed , says Ambrose . With Britain and the U.S. in disarray , the Soviets might have overrun Germany , Italy and France . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Red Army would have been poised at the English Channel . By this time , the Allies ' only recourse would have been the atom bomb . <P> And so on , with ever more counterfactual supposes , would-haves , might-haves , could-haves , possiblys , perhapses , probablys and maybes , in all their dizzying permutations  --  from Jerusalem in 701 B.C. to China in 1946 . What If ? editor Robert Cowley , who also edits MHQ : The Quarterly Journal of Military History , says this exercise is no mere parlor game but makes history " come alive . " Others might call it pointless , if mildly interesting . The bloody " factuals " of history are vivid enough without foraging into further imaginings . <P>  --  By Jesse Birnbaum
