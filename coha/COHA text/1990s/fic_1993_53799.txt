Fei Lo noticed the new clerk right away , a persimmon in a basket of oranges . Three letters on a gold-toned plaque spelled out her name . So as to make no mistake , the old gentleman wrote it in his notebook , FUR . He liked to know the names of all the women tellers , as he flirted with each in turn ; he had even when his wife was alive . The clerks indulged him , they treated him with deference , they called him Ah Goong , Old Grandfather . Behind his back they said , without derision , Fei Lo , Fat Man . <p> Fei Lo tipped his hat . <p> Fur said good morning , and she called him Ah Goong . <p> " Your name , very pretty . " <p> She smiled . " I chose it myself . " <p> Her mother had named her Four Fragrance . When American-born Chinese made fun of her nonsense name , she changed it to Fur , something she coveted more than any perfume . She tried first Mink , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too many syllables for Chinese . She finally settled on the all-encompassing Fur , and while it made no more sense than Four Fragrance , the other tellers let it go . <p> " Yes . Fur . Very distinctive . " <p> Fur gave the old gentleman her full attention . <p> Fei Lo smiled , too . <p> He would offer a proposition . She only had to wait . " Something I can do for you today ? " <p> Fei Lo could tell by the shift of her weight that she had stepped out of her shoes . He tapped his breast pocket where he kept his deposit . <p> " Guess , " he said . " Guess the amount of my deposit , within ten percent , and I will sign my check over to you . " <p> Fur pressed her bunions back into her shoes , she rolled her tongue over her teeth . The clerks on either side stopped in mid-motion but did not look up . <p> Back-room eavesdropping had mid her about the rotund flirt , his large appetites and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hong Kong rents , shack storefronts , three dollars a square foot . She quickly calculated the ten-percent error and added a chunk . She did her best imitation of shooting in the dark . <p> " $23,199 ! " <p> Fei Lo 's eyes narrowed . He glanced about . The other women made busy . He did some calculating himself as he pulled out his check . <p> " Pretty good guess . But you are off about fifteen percent . Still , pretty good guess . " <p> " No ! So close ? Let me see ! " Fur examined the front and back of the check as she stamped it . " Maybe next time I 'll be more lucky . " She grinned . <p> " Hmmm . Maybe . " <p> The next time Fei Lo came into the bank , Fur timed her transactions to coincide with his arrival at the head of the line . " Ah Goong , you are a traveled man . You ever been to Las Vegas ? " <p> " Oh , many times . But Tahoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Umm . Like gold is better than paper . " <p> " You win ? " <p> " Win ! Of course , win . Even when I lose , I win . Consider our hotel , very reasonable , very nice . Dining room  --  out of this world . Menu thick like a book , and every dish ready at your fingertips . " He passed his hand over the counter so elegantly Fur lifted up on her toes to see . " Lovely pink crab , prime rib , five different ways to eat potatoes  --  " <p> " Any desserts ? " <p> " On a table of their own ! Meringue pies , sweet cream cakes  --  " <p> " Chocolates ? " <p> " Ah , chocolates . " Here he reflected . " Yes , chocolates . Even on your pillow , chocolates . " <p> Fur framed a smile and lowered her eyes . She could even blush on demand . <p> " Twelve dollars , " he said , staring straight at her . " All you can eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarded each other . Between them , the tellers ' counter laid end to end with food only they could see . <p> " I do n't go anymore . " <p> " Why not ? " <p> " Wife died . She did n't like to go , " <p> " Oh , sorry , Ah Goong . I did n't know . " Fur knew . She had read his entire file . " But Goong , what 's to keep you , now that you are a free man ? " <p> " No . Ca n't . It 's no fun without her . " <p> Fur nodded . " Yeah , yeah , I understand . " <p> Fei Lo reached into his breast pocket . He tried to keep it light . " Neih seung mhseung heui ? " You want to go ? <p> " Seung ! " she said . " You bet . I 'm going , yes , I am . " The bank clerk tilted her head towards a sign promoting the opening of new Certificates of Deposit , $ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free trip . " She winked . She drummed her fingernails , red painted over chipped . <p> Fei Lo turned away long enough to read the large print . " And how many you have so far ? " <p> " Nineteen , " she said , as if giving her age . He laughed out loud . The clerk on her . right shot a glance , the one on the left harrumphed . <p> He pulled out his deposit and pushed the check towards her . She saw his knowing smile . <p> " Oh no , Ah Goong , you get much more interest if you add this to your existing account . Oh , but you are such a kind man . Really , I mean it . Do n't worry , before the day is over I will get my trip to Las Vegas . I 'm a good salesman . " <p> Fei Lo was thrown . " Hmmm . " <p> Fur punched in his account number , then stopped , " , ah Goong , you want me to be happy ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ah , he thought , here it comes after all . " I want all you young women to be happy . " <p> " You have been so kind to me , since the very first day . I want to take you to lunch . Will you let me , please ? " <p> The bank clerk herded the fat man into the most expensive restaurant in Chinatown , one with valet parking and a doorman . Her eyes worked the room , studying , memorizing the choice of wallpaper , the recessed lights , the antique screens  --  scholar on a donkey , painted silk in a teak surround . <p> " Oh no , Ah Goong . " She pulled the paper insert out of his hand. , " No rice plate specials for you today . It 's my birthday and we are having only the finest food on the menu . " Oh ! Yin wo ! " She lay her hand on his arm . " I 've never had Bird 's Nest Soup . Can we have that ? I mean , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hand . She removed it and giggled . <p> A fiftyish woman in a wool crepe suit bumped Fur 's shoulder and made a point of apologizing . Fur never had a lady apologize to her , and this woman was deft . She managed within the same breath to greet her friends three tables away , tossing her hand in an effortless wave . As she passed , Fur caught the surprise of her shoes , faux leopard with an open toe , the flash of red , as if a woman 's power and every secret resided in the feet . Fur rubbed the top of her own pump against the back of her other leg , a quick , dry polish under the table . <p> Fei Lo was staring at her . " So , how old are you today ? " <p> " Oh ! How old do you think I am ? " She crossed her legs and leaned forward on her elbow . She giggled . She swung her free leg carelessly . <p> Fei Lo got a little warm . He giggled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and studied . He tried to consider balance and contrast , spice and subtlety , texture , methods of preparation , a soup , a fish , a fowl , some green vegetables to cleanse . He peered over his bifocals at her . <p> She flipped back and forth in the eight-page menu , her eyes scanning down the right-hand column as if doing addition . She smiled . " Remember , it 's my treat . " <p> It 's my treat was repeated three more times during the meal . They ordered as if for a wedding banquet . Fei Lo was smitten to finally find a woman not afraid to eat . He did n't know Fur had not eaten since breakfast the day before , but he had already guessed that she could n't afford such a meal on her salary and that , in the end , they both expected him to pay . By the time the oysters arrived , sizzling , practically leaping off the hot cast iron plate , he also deduced it was n't really her birthday . <p> Fei Lo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his things out of the trunk , and started up the hill . He enjoyed the approach to the gravesite and did n't want to rush . He liked the walking , the tulip beds in spring , the tall stalks of summer , grass that stained the hems of his pants , proof of his participation . He liked reading the names on the house-like tombs , miniature temples adorned with columns . He , too , owned one of these stone houses , enough space for an extended family , guarded by an iron gate . If he drove up to the site , he might feel compelled to drop off the flowers and just go . Soon he might not come at all . Their children rarely came  --  at Christmas , her birthday , maybe Mother 's Day , in alternating turns that smacked of arrangement . <p> He set his things down and used both hands to open his folding stool . He unlocked the gate and opened it wide , letting into the crypt every possible ray of sun . He hung his coat on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hear that ? " The crunch of leaves fueled his appetite . " Indian summer , " he sighed . He sat down on the folding canvas . <p> From a plaid thermos he poured some fragrant hot tea . He fanned himself with the Chinese daily . When the tea cooled , he unwrapped the towel he used as insulation and untied the string around the square pink box , enough dim sum for a family : parchment chicken , pink shrimp in translucent dresses , sweet rice studded with three treasures and bound with shiny ti leaves , sweet black bean paste in a golden seeded pouch . From the tens of offerings from the dim sum tray , Fei Lo always chose those that came wrapped up like gifts . <p> The sun warmed his back and he did not sweat . Fei Lo chewed his toothpick into a flat pulp . He did n't look at his wife 's grave . With effort he could get through the entire visit without mentioning the bank clerk 's unusual name , or the number of times they 'd had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held the newspaper upright and turned a bit away from the gate . This was not the way he had imagined it , him sitting here talking to her . The vision that had come most frequently to him , in the years before her death , was of her , her approaching with plants and flowering shrubs , working on hands and knees , she , who would finally discover in widowhood the meditation of horticulture . <p> " Young Woo died last week , " he relayed . <p> Young Woo was the seventy-three-year-old son of Old Woo , who was still living , in his own home , in his own bed . Young Woo had built from a corner stand , selling hand-knotted brushes , a chain of hardware stores stretching up and down the peninsula . He made Old Woo very comfortable . His last act was to step on wet dog excrement . Young Woo saw the droppings as he was taking the wheelchair from the trunk , and he was very careful while helping his father sit down . A car double-parked behind him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Woo let go of the wheelchair . It rolled , he lunged , he slipped , and broke his hip , from which he never recovered . Young Woo had built from nothing , yet this the ladies at the bank would soon forget , as quickly as they would forget his name , recalling only a man who was killed by dog droppings . Fei Lo unbuttoned his vest . He knew what men feared . Men feared acts of foolishness . Women had no trouble with this . They only feared being unvalued . <p> The air chilled . The widower lifted his head just in time to see the last of the fall sunset , a pulsing ovoid tangent to the Pacific , the sky seared orange and red . As on recent days , he thought he could see with his naked eye , even at this distance , ribbons of fire eject from the surface , streamers from a departing vessel . She burned , his sun , day and night , witnessed or not , she burned . <p> " What a fine view we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And , as he did at the end of each visit , Fei Lo watched until the colors bled from the sky . Then he slowly packed up to go . <p> " I 'm looking for investors . " <p> They had warned him she would ask for money , it was just a matter of time . Fei Lo wanted to give it to her . Whatever she asked . But his son said , No . His daughter said , No . They said , We do n't want it , Dad , but you need it to live on . And why would you want to give it to this woman with no family ? Fei Lo had wondered how he could have raised such children . And yet , when a certain woman had asked Young Woo for a loan , Fei Lo had offered similar advice . <p> Fur laid her chopsticks across her rice bowl , she nudged her plate aside . She had barely eaten . <p> " Ah Goong "  --  she spaced her words  --  " I 'm not a clever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Me , I only have so many good ideas . Not every day . This is my good idea . A beauty shop for hair . No permanents . No color . No nails . Just wash and cut . Look , look at our beautiful hair . " <p> Fur whipped out her drugstore compact and shoved the mirror under his nose . Fei Lo had a view of the top of his head , spare gray strands parted low on one side and combed over to the other . <p> " Thick , straight , and black . The most desirable hair in the world . Why make it something different ? " She snapped the compact shut and tapped it on the table . " Wash and cut . " She amended as she went . " More than a cut , a shape , a frame for the face . A high class . " She inhaled with care . She looked him in the eye . " Partners . Fifty-fifty . " <p> He stared at her , chopsticks poised . The rice was getting cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my idea , yes or no ? " <p> Fei Lo hated talking business over food . He wished she had asked for fun money . He gladly would have given that , even a monthly allowance , whatever she wanted , for a little silk scarf , a sumptuous dinner , car payments . But this was an investment , and while the actual dollars might end up being the same , or even less , he had to think it out . Real estate he knew , but not shop-keeping . He asked himself , Is it good business ? Does she know about hair ? Has she any talent ? <p> As if from behind his ear the bank clerk pulled out a card , the name of a salon , someone else 's salon . " I 'm there Thursday nights , all day Saturday and Sunday until four . " Whenever she was n't at the bank . <p> Fei Lo considered Fur 's own hair , which was chemically curled and had never struck him as anything special . But then he was not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want their hair cut by her . Would his wife have gone to her ? Would the ladies at the bank ? And there came to him a startling realization . " Women do n't like you . " <p> He spoke with such carelessness , as if comparing coats in a store window , that Fur , too , saw herself with detachment . " That 's right . Women do n't like me . I do n't fit , do I ? But men like me fine . And men get their hair cut three times more often than women . " <p> Fei Lo nodded . " Then what you really want is a barbershop . " <p> " No , no , no . No barbershop . Beauty shop . Barbers charge a fraction what hairdressers charge . " She marked off the tip of her index finger with her thumb to indicate how small a fraction she had in mind . " Barbers do n't wash . I wash . I wash very good , very gentle . Men like that . You come sometime , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other . <p> Fei Lo thought about more shrimp , salty , crusty , pan-fried little devils in their bed of lettuce . <p> Fur let her gaze wander about the room . She tinked her glass with her chopsticks . When the waiter approached , she got up to go to the restroom . <p> Fei Lo caught her eye . " Let me think about it . " <p> She nodded once and smiled , knowing that he would n't . <p> The bank clerk made a detour by the bar and talked to three different men , men she knew well enough to touch their shoulders . There was laughter , eyes that did not move , glancing hands , codes he had long forgotten . When she continued on to the bathroom , the men watched through half-closed lids . Heads inclined in her direction . Someone made a joke . They all laughed . <p> Fur took her time returning . Fei Lo stood up and held out her chair , but she did not sit . She took her jacket in one arm and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a long drive for me back to Fremont . " <p> " But I can take a cab . Please , sit down , we have n't finished our dinner . " <p> " Oh , no , I could n't let you take a cab . You are my dearest friend . I 'll wait . Please . Sit down . Eat . " <p> She sat and did not look about , did not eat , did not fidget . She was more silent than even his wife had been on her most quiet days . <p> Fei Lo lost appetite . He did n't ask for the leftovers . <p> They drove , and the silence sat between them like cold fat . Chinatown blurred into downtown , blurred into the lakefront , man-made , polluted , and fringed with high-rises . A wall of glass separated them from a dinner party halfway up a building , sparkling stemware , red wine and white . A family ate in silence . Another tasted from cartons passed back and forth . Others were locked down for the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue light . On the top floor , darkness , except for one low light , a night light . As their car rounded the bend , Fei Lo could make out a form . A child too young to stay alone pressed her palms into the glass and kissed her own reflection . <p> " Is it true , what they say about your father ? " And as soon as the words came out , he regretted . <p> Fur tapped the brakes . " Who , they ? What do they say ? " <p> " The women at the bank . They say  --  " Fei Lo blushed . " They say your father had two wives . " <p> The women had circulated a story about young Four Fragrance , some said twenty , some said eighteen . One woman said she was barely fourteen , with a dead mother and the address in America of a father she had never met . They spiced it up with his car , all fins and angles , his quick drive up to the curb , a hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running . They iced it with his parting line : " I have no daughter . Do n't call me again . " <p> Fur said nothing , and Fei Lo wondered if she had heard him . She drove straight to his house with no instruction from him . She pulled right up the curved driveway , as if she did it every day , and parked behind his garaged Lincoln Continental . She killed the engine and looked out at nothing in particular . <p> " Rumors , Ah Goong , are like the bamboo . Planted and left alone they will multiply into a forest that blocks out all light . They weave a root system you can not destroy . The tiniest splinter can cause unbearable pain . And every day the bamboo sways , it bangs one into its neighbor . It wails its song , it clanks its tune , and makes you deaf to all other music . " She turned and smiled at him . " Or so my mother used to tell me . You believe this ? " <p> They sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You want to come in ? " <p> She did n't answer , but when he came around and held open her door , she got out . <p> Fur sat cross-legged on the bathroom carpet , reading outdated decorating magazines . Her eyes stopped on an advertisement of metal spiral staircases . She tore out the page and tossed it with other torn sheets , ragged ideas for a dream salon . <p> Fei Lo was a few steps away when he thought he heard something rip . He tapped the door . " Is everything all right ? " <p> She did n't answer . <p> He unlocked the bar and set out his favorite liqueurs , substituting brandy for port and French for domestic until he felt he got it right . He went back and asked if she would like a drink . She turned a page and said without shouting , " I ca n't hear you . I 'll be out soon . " <p> When Fur finally emerged , the TV was on . Fei Lo had fallen asleep , his head hung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francisco . Glass exploded . A barefoot woman half in flames stumbled from the building . The fire seized her like a jealous husband . Fur nudged the old man with her finger . His lips fluttered . <p> She walked along his mahogany bookcases , dragging that same finger along the shelves . No dust . Even now , though she was dead , no dust . Not many books , either . Some statement in simplicity . But each spare shelf was anchored by an object , things she probably picked out . <p> Above the bar were a pair of lions , one facing east and one west , carved from jade so rare the stone was almost white . She picked one up and almost dropped it . Much too heavy to slip into a pocket . On another shelf  --  arranged so precisely as to discourage touching  --  what looked like shoehorns . Fur flipped one over . They were shoehorns . Here , in the front room . Carved ivory , no two alike , untouched by human feet . A pair of this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if Fei Lo 's wife bad been shoring up against a day of enormous need . Fur understood that urge . <p> Here , sterling bowls , graded to nest , so shiny with polish they sang . The hollows of each were lacquered a different color  --  ruby , emerald , sapphire . Fur pulled a bobby pin from her hair , bit off the coated tip , and ran the sharp end against the ruby hollow of one . She was surprised that it did scratch . She glanced at Fei Lo , then wet a finger with saliva and tried to repair the damage . She shrugged , picked up another . <p> This bowl was filled with chocolates , individually wrapped in foil and molded into assorted sea shells . Fur put a fat fistful in her pocket and continued her tour of Fei Lo 's house , saving the master bedroom for last . <p> From the dim hall light , Fur could see her , Fei Lo 's dead wife , captured as a young woman of forty , sitting in the shade of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even seated , the woman looked uncommonly tall . Fur flopped down in the middle of the bed . She wondered what kind of woman would wear a suit in her own backyard . <p> Two doors flanked the oversized bed . One led to Fei Lo 's closet , the other to an enormous walk-in , perhaps once a study or a nursery , and finally refitted as a temple of adornment . On either side of the door , identical dressers , gloss white with cut-glass pulls . Opposite was a matching cabinet for shoes , shoes for every season and social occasion , including shoes in which to be alone in the house . Handmade of glove leather , not one pair would redefine the toes , or hinder flight from a difficult situation . <p> Fur stepped in . She opened drawers , she fingered lingerie several sizes too large . Around her neck she wound a rope of pearls . <p> On the vanity lay an engraved silver tray filled with everything a woman needed to enhance , mask , or preserve . She picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then tried to fan away the sticky perfume . Luster , Bedazzle , Remembrance  --  lip-sticks that gave no clue to their color but attested to some state of mind  --  Promise . She wiped off her own lipstick and drew a new mouth . The vivacious pink favored by older women barely covered lips stained dark red . The corners of her mouth where the tissue had missed formed sharp little brackets around her smile . She looked all wrong and told herself it was lovely . <p> Initials were carved into the matching brush . Fur tossed her hair . One , two , three . . . one hundred strokes a day for a dazzling shine . In the dusty gutters between the bristles , the hairs of two women matted into a loose felt . Fur rested her forehead against the mirror . It refreshed . When the glass beneath her warmed , she rolled her forehead to the next cool spot . A little breath escaped . She opened her eyes . Pink lips , so close to her own , they almost touched . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less effort than holding the distance , she pressed her lips against the glass . <p> When she turned to go , she saw it . <p> In the back of two long racks of dresses  --  a zippered cotton bag . Dark brown hairs poked through the neck , their glisten subtle but distinct . Fur walked over . She unzipped . There it was , Fei Lo 's dead wife 's coat  --  mink , past the knees . <p> The gold paper was stamped with a pattern of ridges and spines , a miniature nautilus wrapped around dark , imported chocolate . Unlike cheap candy that clawed and irritated , this confection slipped down the throat and satisfied . <p> The gold paper was subtly textured , and , like fine damask , when angled just so to the light , it revealed secret designs  --  diamonds  --  iridescent and intermittent . Opened flat , the foil was about a three-inch square . It never failed to amaze Fei Lo how boxes and bags could be knocked down to a flat piece of hard paper with notches and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design could not be flattened . They were hot-stamped into the paper almost permanently , giving the wrapped chocolate its crisp elegance . Fei Lo turned the foil over . A shard of chocolate fell free from the crease . He stared at it before knocking it into his mouth . <p> In the restaurant , he would watch his daughter fold the long , flat envelope her chopsticks came in , first twice along its length , then diagonally across one end . She would turn the paper over , and fold , turn , and fold , butting one crease up against its neighbor , a process that gave the translucent paper thickness and integrity . Then she would hook the ends together and make a ring on which to rest her chopsticks . She made one for him and one for herself , her fingers busy while they discussed the menu . He had watched her do this many times , and still he could not duplicate the process . <p> He tried it now with this square of gold foil , knowing the proportions were wrong and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath whistled , but he refused to breathe through his mouth . Only children , asthmatics , and dying dogs breathed through their mouths . He also refused to talk to himself . He would not do that . So it was largely in silence , broken by this whistling breath , that he folded and refolded the gold paper , patiently trying to transform a flat square into a standing ring , as he waited for Fur to call . <p> It was Thursday when he found the foil , almost two weeks after their last dinner . The gold paper lay scrunched in the hallway outside his daughter 's old bedroom , a room last used by his wife as her private refuge . She could have sat in their raked rock garden , or in the living room overlooking the creek , but she preferred to spend her afternoons in her daughter 's old room , which faced east and was cool . What she did in there he never asked , and she never volunteered . He occasionally passed the door just after she went in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would return : the flap of a shade , a book scraping the shelf , a lamp switch at midday . <p> He would n't have stopped outside the door , but there was this piece of litter , this scrap of gold . He bent over , and from that stooped position he could see light under the door to a room unvisited except by the housekeeper . <p> Fei Lo opened the door . <p> It was n't the overhead , but a table lamp in the middle of the room . He walked over in such a hurry to walk out again , he was already turning away as he reached for the switch . The hot socket stung . He recoiled and slipped on something slick  --  opened books , half shoved under the club chair . <p> " What the goddamn . " <p> Afraid of moving his feet , Fei Lo leaned on the table , setting his considerable weight on his forearm . He turned the light up another notch . More books lay on the carpet , almost as if arranged . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here  --  here , where his child used to sleep . Fei Lo spun as if he heard a thief . Not just in here . No . She had gone into each of the twelve rooms of his house . He could imagine her , nosing around , touching everything , her eyes eating up whatever they wanted , greedy , hungry animal , while he slept , while he snored , the indignity . What had she ever wanted that he had not given ? He wanted to ask , he wanted to know , What kind of girl you are you come into my house and look while I sleep ? He dialed . Her phone rang , rang , rang . Had he slept with his mouth open ? He angled his watch face to the light . Ten p.m . He hung up and redialed . Hung up again . Call the police . He laughed . And tell them what ? That she ripped up some magazines ? That she dared to sashay in here in her , her sa chahn way , here where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out his handkerchief and wiped his forehead . Robbed . He was sure of it . His son had been right . His daughter had been right . Surely , she had taken something . <p> He walked around until he was standing where he imagined her sitting . But he was mistaken . Photo albums , not books . He traced the trail back to the bookcase , shelves tight with albums , a rack as high as a hatted man , as wide as a marrying couple . <p> The old man slumped into the overstuffed chair and just as reflexively jerked his feet back , as if at the last moment he saw her sitting here , cross-legged on the floor , her skirt inching , inching , surrounded by these musty photographs  --  birthday parties , horses , a succession of bigger houses and better neighborhoods . And when her legs became numb she had stood up and stretched . While he slept in the front room , she had kicked off her shoes , tucked naked legs under , and sat , in this same chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door , where she talked in hushed tones with girlfriends , where his wife used to nap , where the two of them brushed each other 's hair while his son wheeled around on his tricycle , head back , hair flying behind , caught forever in the streak of being two years old . <p> Funny , Fei Lo did not remember his son having a tricycle . But every child had a tricycle . <p> He got out his glasses . He pulled the lamp close and sat down . The album was edge-stitched with brown yarn . Roy Rogers waved from his horse and smiled the So long smile . Fei Lo wiped the cover with a handkerchief , sneezed , and turned the page . A square of foil slipped out . And another . A cascade of gold . <p> He dropped the book . <p> He stood up faster than his blood could recover and he lumbered across the room . The doorframe boxed him . Seal it up . Let the housekeeper tidy it . He slammed the door . It popped open again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willing some cooperation between heart and lung . <p> In time , the eye adjusts . Pupils dilate . A table lamp and a comfortable chair were what he saw . Together they defined a space and scale for intimacy . Yes , he could imagine them here , his daughter , his wife , even Fur . Nothing had happened . She had been looking , only looking . It could just as easily have been like that . <p> Fei Lo thought about cold chicken and jook , thick rice soup , hot and cleansing . He thought about bed and forgetting . But the widower went back in , as if his life depended on it . <p> If there were ten albums on the floor , there were another eighty or ninety still on the shelves , no two alike . The books on the top shelf documented the youth of his wife , until she married ; then she almost disappeared . There were few pictures of him or of the two of them , fewer yet of the entire family . And what pictures there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little recall , as if his participation had been aural and after the fact . <p> Here  --  something familiar . On their wedding day , his mother had broken her toe and brothers jostled for the privilege of carrying her . Her mother was relieved to find for her gangly daughter a decent and equally tall husband . He turned a page . His bride could not believe how skinny he was , coming from such ample parents . And after she had gotten used to skinny , she could not believe how quickly he could grow . With each return trip to Hong Kong , he would multiply their wealth , hers , and come back displaying it to the world around his middle . That day , she had loved him handsome in a top hat , and said he should own one . With that passing remark , she had inspired in him a taste for acquisition as a measure of his feeling for her . That day he had kissed her for the first time . <p> Fei Lo had to close his eyes , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years he had perfected the habit of falling asleep in his chair , to awaken refreshed after everyone had gone to bed . Then , in the company of other people 's sleep , he would pad about the house , eating whatever he wanted , wherever he wanted , admiring figurines he suspected were new , thumbing through textbooks lying about , arranging the shoes at the front door into tidy pairs . <p> After the children left and after his wife died , he was at liberty to roam the house . He stayed up later and later , to bed at dawn , to table at three . Soon he could not distinguish night from day . He feared a tumor . His doctor laid a hand on his shoulder and said it was grief , and would pass . <p> Christmas , 1962 . His wife posed in her new ranch mink , the top of her head cut off , her eyes red from the flash , making her seem alien . He had admired her coat when she came to pick him up . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my way home from the airport . Perhaps it could be my Christmas present . " Each year , he returned three , four times to Hong Kong , to inspect their properties , to visit their mothers . But he only ever missed that one Christmas . <p> He thought he saw his wife last week , in San Francisco , going up the alley-like Commercial Street . Or rather , her mink coat . A woman walking away , in a fur coat , and on a fairly mild day . The warm weather and the coat 's vague familiarity distracted him , because the walk he knew very well . He had spent many evenings watching Fur walk away . <p> Fei Lo slipped a finger beneath his bifocals and rubbed . He did n't have to go to his wife 's closet to check , he knew . <p> A fur coat . She wanted a fur coat . For a damn coat she made herself into a thief . <p> Dinner , she had written . Next Saturday . Someplace new . All you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He could just taste her lipstick when he woke . <p> Fei Lo pushed himself up from the chair and made his way to bed , overcome with the fatigue of a hiker who realizes , as he reaches the peak too late in the day , that his rest will be inadequate , and his descent will have to be made mostly in the dark . <p> Dusk and the lighting of the city appeared hand in hand . Thousands of amber lights came up in the special stillness that occurs only in dead winter . The city shimmered . <p> Of all the views of this city , Fei Lo loved best this one , at night from Treasure Island . From the island , the city 's spires seemed to rise straight out of the Pacific in defiance of gravity . These buildings were set upon precious square footage and thrown up to the skies , maximizing the total number of rooms that could command rent . Under these towers lay a scattering of human-sized buildings . One of them was new and sprawling , built in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lo got back on the bridge and continued on to San Francisco . He arrived and drove three times around the same blocks until a street spot opened up , half hoping for failure and an excuse to go home . <p> A single restaurant occupied the entire new structure , a building so flat an expanse it spread out like a stain , this restaurant launched by a Hong Kong entrepreneur eager to reinvest , eager to put both the Empress and the Mandarin to shame . Every lavishness had been pursued . That was the talk . And to guarantee good fortune , the owner had staged a parade , he hired a dragon , he chose a name of promise and called it The Forbidden Palace . <p> Fei Lo hated this kind of restaurant , where overplush carpets absorbed all gaiety , where autographed pictures defined who you were n't and men felt more at ease without their families . Gloved waiters served with discretion . Deals were negotiated in a subtle melange of tranquility and artful consumption . Right hands clasped , left hands remained on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to eat ? Fei Lo could not comprehend . Yet he had attended the grand opening and returned each subsequent Saturday night , arriving early , staying late , eating , drinking , hoping for a glimpse , a chance encounter to set Fur straight . <p> But opening night belonged to the wife , the mother of the owner 's sons . The following Saturday , to the owner 's favorite mistress , not the youngest , but the most ruthless . With each succeeding week , Fei Lo had felt both a petty victory and some small embarrassment for Fur , whose one claim in the hierarchy was to be novel . <p> Tonight he should have stayed home . Or gone to the Economy Care in Oakland  --  run by a Chinese granny in constant sport of very clark glasses to filter out what the grill on the windows could not . For a fraction of what he would be leaving here for a tip , he could have had a fine bowl of granny 's jook . The rice soup soothed as it meandered through one 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His stomach was in need of rest . <p> Fei Lo arranged and rearranged his utensils . From a deposit slip , he tried once again to fold a paper ring , ignoring the ceramic one that matched in design the plates and bowls and the solid brass door handles . He canted the ubiquitous chopsticks  --  here , ebony . <p> He was tired and was contemplating leaving , going home to lie down , just getting up and going , now , before the waiter arrived , when Fur finally walked in . <p> She was preceded , however slightly , by the men in tuxedos , the owner and his towering guards . Fei Lo knew S.K. , a man of questionable alliances on both sides of the Pacific . During the Japanese War , he had tried to buy up a quarter-mile section of Tsim Sha Tsui , including property once owned by Fei Lo 's wife . <p> S.K. conferred with his men , his eyes swept the room . He pointed with discretion and the young men nodded as one . The group began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was standing all alone . And yet she continued to wait for one of the men to come back , to help her out of her coat , to hand it to the checker , this fur that had belonged to an Amazon of a Cantonese and that she clutched to her breast as if it protected against some as yet undiscovered element . <p> Fei Lo went past the bar , past the bank of telephone booths , past several doors marked PRIVATE and down the broad , curving stairs , following arrows that pointed the way . On the door to the men 's room was a hand-lettered sign : The management regrets . . . Please , use the Ladies ' Room . Fei Lo could hear voices , arguments about specifications and fulfillments punctuated by banging pipes and gurgling water . He added percussion of his own as he turned away  --  his shoes squished the carpet . <p> The door to the ladies ' room was propped open , Fei Lo hesitated . His intestines beckoned . Inside , two more doors faced each other . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other and was startled to see a sickish old man , equally startled , staring back at him . It was himself , reflected in a mirror . He was standing in a generous powder room faced with enormous sheets of silvered glass , ceiling to floor and wall to wall . Relief came where one expanse of glass was sheared by a slab of peach-veined marble . Fei Lo was now supporting his gut with one hand . He should n't have ordered for two , should n't have then tried to eat it . Some men came out of the washroom after first allowing a woman to pass . It seemed all right to go in . <p> He rushed through the washroom to the toilet room and locked himself in the first free cabinet . Despite the warm tones and textured wallpaper , he still felt the chill , the damp . <p> By the time the old man finished his business , the washroom had emptied out . He removed his jacket and hung it on a gleaming hook . <p> The hall door creaked open and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Someone was standing in the powder room . While she herself could n't be seen , her reflection could . His heart contracted . <p> The old man worked the pink soap into a lather . " Do n't turn ? Why not ? " <p> Fur tried to make it light . " I have to fix my slip . " <p> Without her coat , he could see she had lost weight . He missed her fleshiness , the suggestion of abundance . Her smart black sheath and stilettos only emphasized her gaunt frame . She looked worn , as if from the strain of standing erect . <p> " Are you well ? " <p> She waited until he looked up again before answering . " Why did n't you stop me ? " <p> He purposely misunderstood . " But you were with your party . " <p> Fur arranged and rearranged a wayward curl . " He 's asked me to marry him . " <p> " Congratulations . " <p> Neither of them mentioned the golden anniversary wife , the litter of mistresses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her smile was a fine line in her face . " Did you marry for love ? What do you and I know about it ? You 've been in America too long . " <p> The old man leaned heavily against the sink , seized by sharp pains in his stomach . He paled . Fur started to go in , then stopped . She was n't used to helping . She did n't know where to begin . When he straightened up , she busied herself with the contents of her purse . <p> She finally blurted out , " What about the coat ? " <p> The old man cupped some water to his mouth . " Your fur coat ? It looks very nice on you . " <p> " Do n't be a fool . It 's not my fur coat . " <p> He had to laugh . <p> " Are n't you going to call the police ? " <p> " And say to them what ? " <p> " Your wife 's coat has been stolen ! " <p> There . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> Fei Lo wet his handkerchief and applied it to the back of his neck . His convulsions had almost subsided . " To call the police I would first have to go home to my wife 's closet , where I never go , and discover that her fur coat is missing . If the coat is not missing , what will the police do for an old fat fool ? " <p> In the other room , Fur 's eyes darted here and about . Everywhere she looked she could see only herself . " You wo n't go into her closet ? " <p> It had never before occurred to him that his death could be sudden . He could very well die tonight . Even right here , down in S.K. 's basement toilet . No one would remember the fortune he had built , from nothing , shacks . They would remember only another old man who died without his family . <p> " In order to find the coat is missing I would have to violate my wife 's sanctuary . I would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would have to consider myself indifferent to a life I ca n't fully comprehend . That would be the cost to me . " He looked for the towel dispensers and found in their place monogrammed linens . " And the gain ? I might get back a coat my wife ca n't wear , a coat my daughter wo n't wear . A political coat , she says . " He tossed his used towel in a basket . " Besides , it 's not the coat that I miss . " <p> The hall door opened . A young man filled the frame . He glanced at Fur . She was drawing a generous outline around her lips . The man continued through the washroom with keen dispassion . From the toilet room came the snap of heels , the bang of doors . Down the aisle . Back . Fei Lo managed to produce a comb . Fur was filling in her lips with a sable brush , an even darker shade of red than she used to wear . She puckered . She blotted . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes , " he said , and he left without haste . <p> Fur was flushed with color , as if the threat excited . All these weeks Fei Lo had mistakenly thought his desperation to find her was to chastise . <p> " Fur , you are the boss . Of your own life , you are the boss . " If only they were in the same room . " Please , learn to make better opportunities . " <p> " Opportunity ! Always the deal ! You and he were torn from the same womb , you think I 'm a deal to be made ? " <p> " Please . I meant no disrespect . " Fei Lo shook his head . He wanted to sit down . " A man can not change the eyes through which he views the world . Opportunity , it 's just my way of speaking . What do I know of fancy words ? I just want for your happiness . " <p> She tossed her tissue and kissed the air in front of her . " Maybe it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fei Lo blushed . " Oh ! You are an impossible girl ! S.K. will ruin you . Without regret ! " <p> " I have a top-floor apartment , a view of the Golden Gate so wide I have to turn my head to see it all . He visits two or three times a month . I regret nothing . " <p> " And your name is on the deed ? " <p> She gave no answer . <p> " You have a driver ? Wherever you go , he goes ? " <p> " I live like an empress . " <p> " An empress is protected by those who watch her . " <p> " And with you , life could be so different ? " <p> " Yes ! Of course different , because I am different . " <p> " Here 's how you are different . You hang on to all those shacks in Tsim Sha Tsui when you could have bought in Victoria , like S.K. , be a millionaire many times over . " <p> His color deepened . " Anyone can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the challenge in that ? I have taken what others discard as worthless and made that into something valuable . " <p> " I am no chunk of land to be improved . I am not worthless . I will not be discarded . " <p> " No . Of course not . " Fei Lo hung his head . He went back over their times together and pondered all the things he might have done differently , knowing that the course of a person 's life is all but unalterable . Yet he was unwilling to give up hope , or the desperate optimism one can acquire in increasing abundance the nearer one gets to the end of life . <p> As if she could read his mind , she said , " Nothing you do will change things . " <p> " What I do is of no consequence , you are right . But what you do can determine the rest of your life . " <p> " Mine is a good life , Ah Goong . No better . " She spoke with little conviction . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to the grave . " From an abundance of names , ga jeh , mui , gu ma , biu jeh  --  precise nouns that left no ambiguity as to whether a sister was older or younger , a cousin was male or female , an aunt was single or not , related by blood or marriage , and on which side of the family  --  from the hundred names which evoked the exact relationship between two family members , he could find not one that might describe what he felt about her . And he had come to think of Fur as family . " We could have had something fine , something that honored us both , a relation not unlike what I had with my wife , or daughter , or sister , or even my mother . Something quite  --  fundamental . " <p> Fur rolled her tongue over her teeth . She snapped her tiny clutch . <p> Fei Lo flinched and made no move to hide it . <p> She avoided his gaze , steadfast and genuine , but she could not avoid the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wife . Something fine , he said . Something fundamental . Something , she felt , completely foreign to them both . He might as well have invited her to jump off the boat . For what ? <p> The minutes ticked . Four , five . <p> Mother , sister , daughter  --  if she could hold still for just a moment , the brilliance would surely fade . The beckoning would pass . <p> Her voice was barely audible . " I 'm a good girl , Ah Goong . You believe me ? " <p> He nodded , with conviction . She did not see . <p> " I was a fool to take the coat . And you had invited me into your home . " <p> Fei Lo 's heart caught . <p> Fur stepped out into the room , a little unsteady , as if on first-time legs . Her determination remained , but not the steel . He could imagine her in the center of other cold rooms , awkward , young , toughing it out , coached from the side by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Fei Lo shifted to turn . <p> Fur held a finger to her lips , at once kiss and admonition : Do n't . . . turn . <p> He ached to turn , to speak to her , face-to-face . <p> She moved decisively towards the door . He struggled . She hesitated . The hall door squealed open . Fur stepped through . <p> He would not remember going up to the street . Nor would he remember the people he passed , any more than they would remember him . He would recall instead the lightness of her steps . <p> Fei Lo climbed the stairs and walked through the restaurant , stopping only when he reached the sidewalk . The stars seemed especially bright and plentiful tonight . Not a wisp of cloud in the sky . Not one . <p> He had to laugh . All these years he had been gazing at the skies at the wrong time of day , so dazzled was he by the sun , so thank-ft , 1 for its warmth on his back . All those nights he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could just as easily have stepped outside his door , and looked up . Bak Dou Chat Sing , Sin Hauh Choh , the Big Dipper , Cassiopeia , the stars were the same no matter what they were called , constant in the firmament , whether or not he looked , there to give definition to the space that could be seen , and hint at what could not . <p> Fei Lo shielded his eyes from the streetlights , and he counted , taking special delight in the faintest sparks , stars that might indeed be small , but could just as easily dwarf his sun while being much farther away . So far away that some already may have burned out , even though their light was just now reaching his eyes . So far away that numbers were incomprehensible . So far away that faith was prerequisite . <p> He counted all the stars that he could see , and when he was finished , he felt confident that if he stood there a bit longer he would spot another . And another . The price for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a clear night . Fei Lo paused to savor its kiss and sting . <p> <p> By LAURA GLEN LOUIS <p> LAURA GLEN LOUIS received a Nimrod/Hardman Katherine Anne Porter Prize for Fiction in 1990 for her story " Verge .
