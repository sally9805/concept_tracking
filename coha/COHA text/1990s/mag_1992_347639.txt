SCHOOLTEACHERS LUC AND ISABELLE BENTZ are hardly extravagant . By day , both teach immigrant children in low-income districts of Paris . At night , the couple returns to the working-class suburb of Sarcelles where , across from a busy train station , they live in a three-bedroom apartment with their daughter and son , ages 3 years and 18 months . The flat is cozy but small , typical of the low-rent units constructed back in the 1950s to house French families repatriated from North Africa . Together , the Bentzes take home $3,600 a month , not a lot for a family of four . Yet they are thinking of having a third child  --  and , unlike many American parents , are not fretting about the potential costs . They know they can count on the French social contract to see them through . <P> If Isabelle gets pregnant again , the national social security system will cover the bulk of her prenatal , delivery and postpartum expenses . She is guaranteed a six-month paid maternity leave , two months longer than for each of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an expanding family . In the third month of her pregnancy , Isabelle will begin to accrue monthly benefits , eventually totaling $343 , to defray the cost of another infant . If Isabelle decides not to return to work , she will get $563 in " parental education benefits " to reward her decision to stay home . If she does return to the classroom , she can count on subsidized day care . All of this is in addition to the $394 in family-related benefits and rent subsidies the Bentzes already enjoy each month , and the $1,074 annual tax deduction they receive for child care . <P> And the Bentzes do not have to worry about Luc 's retired father . He collects more than 80% of his former salary in pension benefits and has access to free medical care . While most Americans would marvel at these entitlements , the Bentzes see nothing unusual in any of this . " I guess , " Luc says , " you can say we 're an average French family . " <P> Small wonder French citizens find the heated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While Democrats and Republicans play , their game of dare-to-care one-upmanship , the French look upon the benefits that attend citizens from cradle to grave as inalienable rights . Why has France  --  and many other West European countries  --  long since reached a consensus about government 's obligation to family while Americans continue to argue across party lines ? While both cultures regard the family as a precious and fragile unit that requires governmental attention and care , historical and ideological factors make the terms of that obligation very different . French workers pay 44% of each paycheck to their government to ensure the wide range of family-related services that touch all generations . The relative homogeneity of society and the centralization of government make delivery of those services easier . Americans , who generally pay lower taxes , seem to distrust anything centrally orchestrated in Washington . As a result , the U.S. has no national child-care policy .
