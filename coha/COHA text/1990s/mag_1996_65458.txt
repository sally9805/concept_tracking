It seemed a reasonable assumption back in December : Snap a 19-game losing streak and the worst would be behind you . In the case of the Vancouver Grizzlies , however , that 19-game skid proved to be a tune-up , a sound check , an appetizer for the epic ugliness to follow . Still , you had to admire the chutzpah of the NBA 's bad news bears , who made dubious history last week and then tendered no apologies for doing so . // No NBA team had lost more than 20 consecutive games in one season  --  until last Friday night in Salt Lake City . Having flirted with the record by dropping the aforementioned 19 straight between Nov. 7 and Dec. 13 , the first-year expansion Grizzlies eclipsed it by losing 105-91 to the Utah Jazz . With their 121-88 defeat by the Charlotte Hornets two days later , Vancouver put some distance between itself and the co-holders of the old record : the 1972-73 Philadelphia 76ers and the 1993-94 Dallas Mavericks . And they were closing in on the mark of 24 straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1981-82 and ' 82-83 . The loss to Charlotte capped a winless month for the Grizzlies . March in Vancouver : In like a lamb , out like a lamb . // The new owners of the NBA 's record for serial futility left the court at Utah 's Delta Center with their chins up . Their dressing room , while subdued , could hardly have been described as funereal , just as shooting guard Blue Edwards could hardly have been described as , well , blue . " If you had n't mentioned how many games we 've lost , I would n't have known , " he said . " The losing streak is not something I dwell on . " Outside , Grizzlies coach Brian Winters displayed a skill at which he has become quite adept : He put the best face on the loss . This time , he pointed out , Vancouver had trailed by just six points with 5:05 to play . " Unfortunately , " he said , " we just ca n't find a way to finish off games these days . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little snakebit , Coach Your team is the lump in the belly of the boa Still , the fact that they have been stuck on 11 wins since Valentine 's Day has failed to trap the Grizzlies in what Saturday Night Lire 's Stuart Smalley would call a " shame spiral . " // " There 's no shame , " says Gerald Wilkins , a 6 ' 6 " shooting guard whom Winters has pressed into service as one of the NBA 's smallest small forwards . " We 're just totally outmanned , and we realize it . We were n't the most talented team in the world before we had a bunch of guys get injured . It 's amazing how many games we 've been competitive in during the streak. " // He was referring to the 22-game swoon  --  Ursa Major , as it were  --  in which the average margin of defeat was 10.9 points . Good news , Grizzlies ! That 's down from your 14.1-point margin during Ursa Minor in November and December . Rather than becoming discouraged and throwing in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it amasses defeats . // For this reason it 's hard to goof on the Grizzlies . They play their guts out every night . Going into last Friday 's game , seven of Vancouver 's previous nine losses had come by five or fewer points . Against Utah the Grizzlies trailed 56-51 at halftime and played well enough to provoke one stout heckler to shout at Eric Murdock , a backup guard for Vancouver , " Murdock , you ca n't even start for an expansion team ! " Not a particularly clever line , but it got Murdock 's attention , since the speaker was Jazz owner Larry Miller . // Perhaps Miller was agitated because the Grizzlies , who had trailed 43-30 , had rallied to take a 49-48 lead . Eventually , though , Vancouver suffered its habitual fourth-quarter collapse , getting outscored 25-18 . But after pouring in 13 of Utah 's final 16 points , forward Antoine ( Big Dawg ) Carr commended the Grizzlies for not being , well , big dogs . " These guys fought . They would n't lay down for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Grizzlies ' grit : Jazz All-Star forward Karl Malone . " You want to pat ' em on the back and say , ' Hang in there , ' because they 're going through some tough times , " said the Mailman . " They 're trying to stop the bleeding . " // Less sympathetic to Vancouver 's victory drought is the NBA itself . Having socked the Grizzlies and the other first-year expansion franchise , the Toronto Raptors , with $125 million entry fees , the league further imposed upon them a $16 million salary cap  --  less by a third than the sum other clubs can spend . Why ? The NBA would have you believe the lower cap is designed to help keep its newest members out of financial trouble . // " Then there is the more cynical perspective , " says Vancouver assistant general manager and legal counsel Noah Croom , who administered the salary cap on a leaguewide basis until the Grizzlies hired him away from the league office before this season . " It goes : We 're afraid that if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and steal free agents from other teams by offering them unrealistic amounts of money . " // The Grizzlies and the Raptors chose sixth and seventh , respectively , in the 1995 college draft . Neither team , no matter how sorry its record , will be eligible for the first overall pick in the draft until 1999 . Call that one the Shaq Rule . The Orlando Magic 's selection of Shaquille O'Neal with the top pick in the 1992 draft and their getting the No. 1 pick again the next season  --  which eventually landed them Anfernee ( Penny ) Hardaway  --  were instrumental in the Magic 's reaching the NBA Finals in just their sixth season . Old-guard NBA owners who resented Orlando 's meteoric rise , and the fact that they did n't get a shot at Shaq and Penny themselves , pushed the new draft regulations through . // " There 's no use crying over the rules . " says Vancouver general manager Stu Jackson , who has vowed to build through the draft . " Our mission is to become successful in spite of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grizzlies can clear $6 million under the cap , enough for them to shop for a solid , mid-level free agent . And with 11 wins at week 's end , compared to Toronto 's 18 , they have a good chance at getting the second pick in the lottery , which is weighted in favor of the lesser teams . // Jackson 's patience came under scrutiny in a recent Toronto Globe &amp; Mail column , in which he was accused of sending the subtle message to players that " losing is O.K. , losing is natural . " In truth , if the Grizzlies are to reap the high draft picks Jackson envisions , then losing is absolutely essential . That 's cold comfort to the men in uniform . " I know you 've got to look at what lies ahead , " said rookie center Bryant ( Big Country ) Reeves after loss number 21 , " but we 've played 69 games and won 11 of them . This is very hard to deal with . " // Reeves has emerged as a true NBA center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an overall beacon of hope in an otherwise gloomy season . A 7-footer out of Oklahoma State and Vancouver 's first-round draft choice last June , Reeves became a starter after the Grizzlies traded center Benoit Benjamin to the Milwaukee Bucks for Murdock and center Eric Mobley in November . After a period of adjustment Big Country has become the focus of the Grizzlies ' offense , such as it is : Through Sunday they were averaging a measly 89.7 points per game , last in the NBA and on pace to be the lowest season average since the shot clock was introduced in 1954-55 . Says Winters , " He gives us someone we can play off of in the low post , which we did n't have before . " As a starter Reeves has played nearly 38 minutes a game and , at week 's end , had averaged 15.6 points and 8.9 rebounds. // He has also become , without trying , a cult figure in British Columbia . Before its Jan. 7 game against the Los Angeles Clippers , Vancouver hosted a Hair Country promotion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Country 's signature flattop would receive two free tickets . Twenty-eight hair stylists were hired for the event , which was expected to draw several hundred crazies . More than 2,000 showed up . The stylists only had time to shear 360 fans  --  18 of whom were women . // But Big Country needs help big time . The main reason the Grizzlies went a month and a half without a victory was their puniness up front . Vancouver lost 6 ' 8 " power forward Kenny Gattison to injury in January and then to Orlando in a February trade . The 6 ' 11 " Mobley went down with tendinitis in his right knee on Feb. 5 . Since then , unheralded 6 ' 7 " forward Ashraf Amaya has been in the front-court rotation along with Wilkins . // Outwardly , Winters has remained composed ; volcanic eruptions are not his style . " Really , what would be the point ? " he says . However , at halftime of the Grizzlies ' 86-75 defeat on March 26 in Detroit , the phlegmatic Winters threw what for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first quarter , the Grizzlies caught fire , as it were , finishing the half with 26 . In the locker room Winters pleaded with his players to have some pride . In fact , pride is the only thing sustaining these players  --  that and the hope of a roster spot next season . Team sources predict that of the 13 current Grizzlies , at most seven will be back . // Byron Scott should be one of them . While point guard Greg Anthony is Vancouver 's floor leader , it is shooting guard Scott , a 13-year veteran who won three NBA championship rings as a member of the Los Angeles Lakers , to whom everyone looks in the dressing room . After Friday night 's landmark loss , Scott sat for a long time with his left ankle in a bucket of ice . He gazed so long into the bucket , you wondered if he was looking for the big picture . // " If you 're just going to pack it in , you 're not showing any discipline . Or heart . Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've lost 21 straight , we 've never packed it in . We 've played everybody hard . That 's something I 'm very proud of . " // No apologies .
