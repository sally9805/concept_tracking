Pittsburgh Steelers All-Pro running back Jerome Bettis is an excellent bowler.Tim Lester , his outstanding lead blocker , however , stinks . Today , Jerome teaches Timand you-to be a ten-pin man . Photograph A Bus man 's holiday . Bettis is grinning because this is his game . Lester is grinning because he 's being a good sidekickand because , thank God , he does n't have to bowl for a living . // To understand the special relationship between Pittsburgh Steelers running back Jerome Bettis and fullback Tim Lester , know this : Keeping a faithful sidekick can be a bitch . Truth is , faithful sidekick is a tough gig . You get lower pay , for starters , not to mention a basically crummy job description : 1 ) Make Big Guy look good . 2 ) Do n't screw up and embarrass Big Guy . The Big Guy gets the big money , the choice cuts , the primo parking spot . Basically , all is copacetic as long as the Big Guy 's the human headline and the sidekick 's the walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he can keep walking . Consequently , sidekicks have been known to develop bad attitudes . Consider Kato . " Stick to the side streets , Kato , " the Hornet hectors him , day after friggin ' day , as if Kato were really going to get on the highway , as if he had n't memorized every damn side street in town , as if he were n't sick of the whole schmear , the uniform , the karate kicking , the nonunionchauffeur crap . And enough already with the bumblebee music . Or take Tonto . Does anyone believe the Kemo-Sabe-this , Kemo-Sabethat crap ? Even the most rabid Lone Ranger fan realizes that the Indian is counting the days till the macher with the mask catches an arrow in his flabby gut . Let 's not even talk about Boy Wonder . Major issues . Now , imagine you 're Jerome Bettis . You 're a big guy with a big problem . You want to keep the faithful sidekick happy , to keep others from hiring the guy who watches your back . What do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secrets of your greatest passion . You will teach him how to bowl . " Naw , man , you 've got your fingers in the ball wrong , " Bettis tells Lester . " Stick " em in this way . " Bettis is the running back with the multimillion-dollar contract , the weekly television show , the All-Pro status , and the cool nickname of the Bus , as in " You ca n't stop the Bus " and " Ride the Bus , ride the Bus . " He was a star at Notre Dame . He is so popular in Pittsburgh that , even though movies are his second greatest passion ( behind bowling ) , he does n't go to first-run houses , because the crowds make sitting and watching impossible . Lester , who blocks for Bettis , has a nickname , too . It 's the Taxi ( beats Friday or Watson ) . He played at Eastern Kentucky . " We 're similar in that we 're both underpaid , " the Taxi says with the sort of sanguine tone that only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's underpaid at $4 million , and I 'm underpaid at $500,000 . " The Big Guy and the Sidekick are today spinning sixteen-pound balls down the basement lanes of the Pittsburgh Athletic Association , a venerable club with entire rooms made of marble , and six-foot-high fireplaces , and forest-green carpets , and sleeping rooms , and a turn-of-the-century swimming pool , and very , very old guys with white hair , slouching through the dark hallways like wraiths in repp ties . Bettis , who is five eleven , 255 pounds , and Lester , who is five ten , 240 pounds , are laughing and clowning to the rap stylings of Jay-Z , whose new CD is blaring from the boom box that Bettis brought . The men are wearing black warm-ups with gold jewelry . It would be safe to say that the wraiths in repp ties at the Pittsburgh Athletic Association do not often witness scenes like this . Bettis is teaching Lester to bowl because Lester is his best friend and because they are each other 's biggest fans and because the happier Lester is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blocking for Bettis , the happier Bettis is and the better he does his job , which is running with the football . ( Besides , Lester 's chief hobby is raising aggressive African fish , and there 's not a whole lot men can share on that topic , other than , " Make sure to keep " em away from other fish " ) Bettis , who has been bowling since his mother took him to his first Coke and Bowl night in Detroit , when he was seven years old , and who bowls a few times a week in the off-season , is the best bowler in professional football . Possibly he is the best bowler in all of professional sports , excepting professional bowling . He averages about 230 , which means that not only does he virtually never miss a spare , but he seldom bowls less than a strike . He hit a 299 in the Johnny Petraglia pro-am last year , and in 1994 he bowled a 300 , which he says was " my greatest sports thrill of all time . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to understand , " Bettis says . " I always liked bowling-always . I got into it " cause I liked it . I started to play football because I needed to get a scholarship . My brother and sister were already in college , and I knew I wanted to go and that an athletic scholarship would let me . But bowling I always liked . " In bowling , you 're competing against yourself , and to hit a 300 is to beat all the odds . So yeah , if I never make it to the Super Bowl , the 300 will be my greatest sports thrill of all time . " The Bus bowls , and the Taxi sits idling , watching . Lester has the finger thing down now , and he is studying Bettis 's approach , the way he pushes the ball forward , pulls it back , and fires away . The Bus has a bad tire today , which is to say his right knee is injured , and he hits six pins , then misses the spare . Still , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He 's damn good , " Lester says . They met in Los Angeles in 1993 , on the field for the Rams . They became good friends when Bettis saw how Lester blocked and Lester saw how Bettis ran . They became very good friends when Bettis said one day , " If I go to the Pro Bowl , I 'm paying your way to come along . " ( Bettis bought each of his offensive linemen forty-five-inch color Tvs that year . ) Bettis and Lester became best friends when they went to the Pro Bowl . When it 's Lester 's turn to bowl , he looks like the Not-So-Little Taxi Who Could n't . He uses too much arm . He holds the ball with his fingers rather than with his palm . He has no follow-through . But Bettis is patient , delivering his instructions in a calm monotone as the Taxi picks off a pin here , a pin there . " Okay , two fingers gripping the ball . No , not those two fingers-those two fingers . Use your thumb just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the fingers . " " Damn , " the Taxi says . During the 1997 NFL season , Bettis rushed for 1,665 yards , third best in the league behind Barry Sanders of the Detroit Lions and Terrell Davis of the Denver Broncos . His size and his power bring to mind bruisers like Larry Csonka and Earl Campbell , men who hurt as often as they blew by those trying to tackle them . Lester blocks with a single-mindedness and ferocity that coaches and well-educated fans love and that Bettis depends on . " Tim 's a great blocker because he 's not afraid of anything or anyone , " Bettis says . " He puts 100 percent into every block . I mean every block . " " Jerome 's greatest strength as a football player is he 's quick , powerful-he 's got great agility , great vision , " says Lester . " He knows when to make a guy miss him and when to run a guy over . Basically , he 's like Earl Campbell with a wiggle , which makes him easy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a guy up for a second or move him off balance , Jerome will be past him , and there 's no way anyone can stop Jerome with an arm tackle . " Lester calls Bettis at home every morning and wakes him , and then Bettis drives over to Lester 's , and they drive to practice together . They eat together and socialize together , and Lester is a regular on The Jerome Bettis Show , which airs every Saturday afternoon in Pittsburgh . Alone , they talk about their jobs and their lives and what they want to accomplish . What they do n't talk much about is 1995 , which was a bad year for both of them . At the start of that football season , the Rams , who had just moved to St. Louis , released Lester . At the end of the season , after benching and not so privately sniping at Bettis , the Rams traded him for what amounted to unproven prospects . Both players ended up on the Steelers . Photograph Lester : Before lessons from the Bus . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ management , Bettis especially reserves some affectionate feelings for the city of St. Louis . " Great town , " he says . " Really great bowling town . I must have been to the International Bowling Museum and Hall of Fame five or ten times . Got to be friends with the guy who ran the place Lester flings his ball down the lane , and Bettis winces and delivers some instructions and then reflects on how bowling and football are similar . Photograph Anatomy of a Strike // " I always throw a few practice balls to check out the oil patterns on the lane , " he says . He throws the first ball four boards in from the gutter . The second ball , ten boards in , just between the second and third arrows . The third ball , straight down the middle of the lane . Based on how the balls roll , he decides how much to hook , how hard to throw , and what kind of ball to use . " In football , instead of throwing practice shots , I study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to penetrate , whether they run through on the backside , making the cutback available . From all that , I can gauge and decide what philosophy I 'll use in that game . Then when we break from the huddle , I do a pre-snap read , see where the defense is lined up , so I can make more decisions . " Lester continues to struggle on the lane . The Bus tries to help . " Now , keep your feet slightly apart . That 's right . Cock the wrist . Keep your wrist tight till the release . No , not like that . Yes , that 's better . Relax . No , more . No , not that much . That 's better . Okay , push the ball away , drop the ball down , bring the ball back . Now , slide when you release . " Lester more stumbles than slides . He picks off a pin . " Damn , " he says . " A lot of beginners see the pros throwing the big hook , and they try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you got ta learn to do is to control the ball . You got ta get your approach down , your timing , the five-step approach going into the slide . After that , you can learn how to bowl with less speed , more speed , big hook , less spin , different oil patterns . " There are so many intricacies to bowling , " he says . " Running a football is much simpler . Somebody gets in your way , you run him over or make him miss . Bowling you have to learn . Here , Tim , let me show you . " The Bus throws a ball , picks off five pins , then throws another ball and leaves a pin standing . " I 'll get a strike on this one , " he says . " No , you wo n't , " says Lester . " You wan na bet ? " Lester looks at his friend , studies the way he 's favoring the bad knee . " Yeah , I 'll bet you do n't get a strike . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeah , fifty dollars . " Bettis pushes the ball out , drops it down , brings it back . He slides when he releases . He strikes . " Damn , " says Lester . " Sucker 's bet , " says Bettis , laughing . " Damn , " says the faithful sidekick . Fl Photograph Be a Pin God ( or Just Look Like One ) // <p>
