<p> Jeff Axelrod is n't surprised that Atlanta radio station contestants have imprisoned themselves in a pair of new Volkswagens at North Point Mall in Alpharetta for 2 1/2 weeks , missing work , missing their families , missing hot showers . <p> And he 's not surprised a reporter is calling him about it either . <p> " These contests may seem silly or crude , but they serve a purpose , " says Axelrod , assistant managing editor of the radio industry trade magazine R &R; in Los Angeles . " Their purpose is to get newspapers and magazines to write about them , and any time a station gets any exposure they do n't have to pay for , those are advertising dollars that do n't come out of their bottom lines . " <p> The " Live in It and Win It " contest , sponsored by Top 40 station Star 94 , is just the latest extreme publicity stunt to hit local airwaves . Others asked listeners to squat on toilet bowls in broad daylight for concert tickets ( 99X ) and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jeep ( 96rock ) . <p> Contests , ones that award small prizes to callers or to listeners who put stickers on their cars , have been a staple of radio stations for decades . But more extreme promotions , which humiliate people , or test their stamina for long periods , have emerged more recently . <p> Axelrod says the cause is radio 's need to draw listeners in an ever-more-fractured media universe . The Internet and proliferating cable TV stations distract the audience at home , while improved tape decks and CD players invite people to tune out while they 're on the road . <p> Also , stations tend to steal ideas . When particular promotions get attention , as some endurathons have , they tend to be copied quickly . " There are only so many original ideas in the world , " Axelrod says . " The rest get borrowed . " <p> Alan Hennes , operations director for Star 94 , ca n't point to any evidence that the current car-sitting gimmick and a similar one last year have boosted listenership . But he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspapers a warm-and-fuzzy human interest story to break up their daily blood-and-guts reporting . <p> Hennes has been busily lining up media interviews for the six remaining contestants , who are competing to outlast each other and drive away in one of the two new cars . <p> " This is a soap opera , and people ca n't help but listen , " Hennes says . " It creates excitement , and people want to be attached to something that they think is cool and entertaining . " <p> Earlier this year , morning disc jockey Gary McKee of classic rock Z93 sat atop a billboard in Buckhead for a month , promoting the station and raising money for two children 's hospitals . <p> " On the radio , you have to create mental pictures for listeners in between the songs , " says Scott Keithley , Z93 promotions director . " It 's a grass-roots approach to meeting and connecting with them and to help them put a face and an image with the voice they hear on the radio . " <p> Yet such stunts are n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the station reached its fund-raising goal , after the obviously fatigued DJ 's on-air patter began to suffer . He berated listeners for not making enough donations . <p> Listener endurathons can have downsides as well . In San Diego this summer , a station 's " Whirl ' Til Your Hurl " contest set a record for roller coaster endurance  --  10 weeks  --  beating out an earlier promotion at Six Flags here . Now some of the Californians are complaining of health effects and strains in family relationships . <p> The San Diego Union-Tribune reports that Debbie Arnold suffers from a sore neck , chronic fatigue , nausea , headaches and mental lapses . " My body feels like it 's literally been trampled on , " she told the newspaper . <p> Another contestant says he suffers from chronic back pain , and a third says her relationships with her boyfriend and children have deteriorated . <p> No one 's come forward with such complaints following any of the Atlanta stunts . But the possibility has attracted a local chiropractor , who 's monitoring and treating Star 94 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Extreme promotions do n't work at all for some formats . Top-rated talker WSB-AM does n't do them , nor does urban contemporary Kiss 104.7 . Carla Griffin , promotions director at Kiss , is convinced her listeners would tune out if she tried such a gimmick . <p> " We do cash giveaways , and those are the most popular kinds of contests because they reward the listener , " Griffin says . " But those other kinds of promos do n't improve the time spent listening , they just create hype . . . . <p> " That 's not the kind of excitement that appeals to an adult listener . " <p> 99X appeals to the right demographic  --  youngish rock fans  --  for extreme contests , and it has sponsored its share of them , including the toilet-sitting one and another that involved a listener duct-taping himself to a lamppost . But Jimmy Baron , a morning DJ at the station , says he 's not a fan of the practice . <p> " Personally I do n't like these marathon contests , " Baron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radio . I do n't think they are entertaining . And I think they bring out the worst in people . <p> " And for the life of me I do n't understand what type of human being has such a little life they can spend eight days on a roller coaster or in a car . " <p> Good question . <p> Two contestants have already dropped out of Star 94 's contest , one for undisclosed " personal reasons , " and another for returning 20 seconds too late from a bathroom break . The survivors  --  three men and three women  --  are a demographically diverse bunch . <p> David Stephenson of Stockbridge is a 23-year-old newlywed whose wife , Tina , is starting to get a little miffed at his prolonged absence . For him this is not just some contest . It 's a mission from God . <p> " It 's a chance for me to bear witness as a Christian , " Stephenson says . " If these guys in the car and all the people out there can see a Christian like me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't seem so bad . That 's a blessing to me . " <p> Sonja Banks , 31 , of Stone Mountain has an 11-month-old son and 8-year-old daughter , whom she has seen only sporadically since the contest began . <p> " Those kids are not my weakness , they 're my inspiration , " says Banks , giving a cheerful thumbs-up sign that has become a nuisance to the other contestants . <p> " Besides , " she says , " what would I look like if my old car broke down on I-285 , and I 'm out there stranded with my babies ? A mama 's got to do whatever a mama 's got ta do . " <p> Banks and fellow contestant Jennifer Roller , a 25-year-old computer graphic designer from Kennesaw , are n't getting along , and do little to disguise their mutual contempt . <p> " She 's obnoxious , and her feet stink , " Roller says . " Do n't you interrupt me when I 'm talking , " Banks snaps back . <p> At 41 , Brenda Burke of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and maybe wisest  --  of the group . She has tried to stay above the fray but admits it 's been difficult . <p> " I decided before I got in this car that I would not lose my integrity , " she says . " But how low will we go to humiliate someone and get them out of here ? I do n't know yet . Give it a few more days .
