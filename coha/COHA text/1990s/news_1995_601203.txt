<p> A padded wicker rocker on a shady porch is a fine place for watching the country unfold . <p> And if that porch rests atop a pristine paddle wheeler plowing a cappuccino row through the murky Mississippi , it 's a fine place indeed . <p> When the $ 65 million American Queen steams out of Pittsburgh on June 27 headed for New Orleans on its official maiden voyage , the future of retro river-cruising will unfurl in true highfallutin style . <p> A strolling card cheat will slip an ace from his sleeve . Floozies will flooze . And 436 passengers will alight from Victorian-styled , air-conditioned cabins and promenade to the bathing pool or ( Mark Twain , forgive them ) , athletic club . <p> They 'll fly paper kites off the stern and sing the old songs to a calliope as the pilot negotiates a radar-guided course past shifting sandbars . <p> The six-deck , 418-foot palace is the biggest , most expensive steamboat ever , and will be a dominant player in the growing river-cruising market . <p> Catering to travelers 50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Queen and Mississippi Queen will generate a record $ 75 million in sales this year . Next year , when all three operate for a full season , they 're projected to carry 54,000 passengers along the Mississippi , Ohio and Tennessee rivers , according to parent company Delta Queen Steamboat Co. of New Orleans . <p> These floating hotels ( distinct from gambling-themed or day-cruise riverboats ) are the only such overnighters on U.S. rivers ; on a smaller scale , the American West Steamboat Co. is scheduled to launch the $ 15 million , 163-passenger stern-wheeler Queen of the West on July 22 , offering two- to seven-night cruises on the Columbia , Snake and Willamette rivers out of Portland , Ore . <p> Four years ago , the Delta Queen Co. determined that the potential market for steamboating would double by 2010 as baby boomers approach retirement . So they commissioned a ship blending the 19th-century aura of Twain with the modern amenities of Trump . <p> " We felt that authenticity sells , " says Jeff Krida , president of the 105-year-old company . " We were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want a classic , low-tech vessel . " ( The steam engines , however , are supplemented with an electric propulsion system . ) <p> Those customers will pay $ 790 per person , double occupancy , for a three-night cruise in a modest cabin , and $ 2,990 for a seven-night cruise in fancier quarters . <p> This riverboat gamble should pay off , says Doug Metz , co-owner and travel guide for BeHo Tours of Buffalo , N.Y . " It 's a very specialized market , but they 've been doing it a long time . There are no other cruise companies that do Americana like this . . . . This is middle America , what the U.S. is all about - and it 's no fake . " <p> Metz says many older cruise clients prefer the relative coziness and convenience of riverboats . The American Queen accommodates 436 in 222 staterooms ; a typical , modern ocean cruise ship carries 1,400-2,400 . <p> And off-shore options , including visits to restored plantations , Civil War sites and historic port cities , are easily accessible , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Pittsburgh-Cincinnati route is best . ) <p> On-board entertainment ranges from tried-and-true musical revues to lectures from riverlorians who hold forth in a stunning , oak-paneled chart room . Atop the room is a cupola with stained glass . " When the sun hits it right , this becomes a chapel , " says riverlorian Clara Isenhour , who has read Twain 's classic Life on the Mississippi three times . <p> If the country is best viewed from its porch , the American Queen is best seen from the banks , on a levee as it pulls up to a plantation home , which it did during a recent shakedown cruise . <p> As it rounds a bend , two black fluted smokestacks resembling exploded cigars towering 109 feet above the water draw your eye first . They frame the gazebo-style pilot house , a window-encased sanctuary topped with a gingerbreaded cupola and a 6-foot rooster weather vane . <p> " It 's the first time I 've ever seen a rooster atop a boat - it 's usually an eagle - but we did n't design it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 'll get an eagle , but we 'll have to make soup out of that rooster first . " <p> Then the gleaming white body rounds into view with a time-warping rush . Mark Twain got it exactly right when he likened these classic steamers to " wedding cakes without the complications . " <p> The American Queen is a wedding cake that invites you to run your fingers through its frosting : iron railings and columns festooned with curlicues and gingerbread trim , 20 flags saluting , elaborate fretwork everywhere . And finally , that definitive red paddle wheel pushing its 3,707-ton treasure along . <p> When the horn announces the docking , it 's a jolt of joy . Waving becomes mandatory . <p> On board , a 20-foot-wide sweeping staircase leads to a mahogany-paneled Mark Twain Gallery adorned with carved Victorian furniture ( some real , some reproductions ) , plush carpets and cases full of 19th-century books and knickknacks . " Victorian gothic - layers upon layer of stuff , " is how Al Luthmers , head of the design team , describes it . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room where ladies can take tea , crank a Victrola or faint on the fainting couch ; on the other , a card room where gentlemen can spit and deal five-card stud under the gaze of a stuffed bear , a billy goat and a big , ugly fish . <p> Another sweeping staircase leads down to the ship 's two centerpieces - the Grand Saloon , modeled after a mid-19th-century opera house and decorated like a Faberge egg ; and the 226-seat J.M. White ( an 1880s steamer ) dining room , a long , lavish space with tapestries , chandeliers , a two-deck-high vaulted ceiling and tall windows for river watching . <p> Upper-end staterooms combine period antiques and hand-carved reproductions , wallpaper re-creating 19th-century patterns , modern bathrooms and gilded mirrors . The best ones open onto decks made for strolling ( seven times around the fourth or fifth decks equal one mile ) . <p> During the recent shakedown cruise on the lower Mississippi , most of the toilets worked , the calliope wheezed and the bartender just about perfected the proportions of rum , vodka and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pilot Harold Howe , who has worked on the American Queen 's sister ships for a decade , agrees the boat has yet to develop a personality . <p> " Right now , she 's beautiful , like a new girlfriend . She 's hard to get acquainted with , but so easy to love .
