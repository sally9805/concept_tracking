IN THE SUMMER OF 1970 , I spent a lot of time trying to get a girl named Lizzie Burford to sleep with me . I had the idea that we would do it at the Goshen Motor Court , out on US 42 , near the county line . We 'd lie in each other 's arms and shiver as the air conditioner blew and the sweat on our skin dried . I was nineteen , a year older than Lizzie , and I thought about motels the way I later thought about churches : as places you could disappear into and lose yourself . I thought of the Goshen in particular because we sometimes drove past it on our way to or from doing nothing . Once when we stopped at the filling station across the highway from it , I saw a woman smoking in a lawn chair in the grassy oval where the motel owner had planted zinnias around an old water pump . I asked Lizzie what she thought the woman was thinking about , and Lizzie said , " She 's thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outdoors watching the traffic go by and he 's in the room eating beer nuts or something ? " <p> " Maybe she got cold in the air conditioning , " I said . <p> " Maybe she wanted to hear the insects sing , " Lizzie said , reaching for the can of beer between my legs . " And now she 's thinking about walking across the highway so she can talk to him . " She indicated the skinny boy washing bug spatters from the windshield . <p> " I like sleeping in motels , " I said . This was more a statement of fact than a proposition . <p> " You 're so romantic , " Lizzie said , laughing , replacing the can of beer . <p> As I waited for the pump jockey to bring my change , the woman crossed the highway . She was barefooted . I wondered if the warmth of the pavement surprised her . Lizzie said , " Think of all the wrong boys you could end up with with breasts like hers . " <p> I took Lizzie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drove to the Frankfort Avenue White Castle and ate six of those silver-dollar-size burgers in about two minutes . <p> The next afternoon , on my way to work , I stopped by Lizzie 's house . As far as I knew , I was the only boy in Jefferson County knocking on her door . This was so not only because she had small breasts and a lanky body in which the bones seemed to hang together in a complex , awkward way . It was so also because she had a straight-A kind of brain and often carried herself in a manner that led some boys to imagine she was standoffish or prideful or touchy or all three . And then there was the matter of her being the daughter of an Episcopal preacher and of failing to behave like the hard-drinking , hell-raising offspring of Episcopal clergymen we all knew . She stole sips of beer from me and did not smoke . <p> When I entered the house , Miles , the Burfords ' black Lab , sniffed my crotch , as he always did , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We passed her parents ' bedroom-the Reverend Burford was at St. Timothy 's ; Mrs. Burford was at the chiropractor 's  --  and then we passed Lizzie 's brother 's room . Harry was in Vietnam . He 'd been there for about two months . <p> Lizzie flopped down on her bed and resumed writing a letter to her brother . She wrote him almost daily , on stationery with psychedelic filigree , which she 'd bought at a head shop . I sat on the edge of the twin , watching her long , bare legs move back and forth , slowly , metronomically . I was aware of a dull ticking in my head . I took off my work boots and found a place beside her . I set my mouth within inches of a vaccination mark on her right arm . She was left-handed , the only left-handed girl in the universe , to my knowledge . Her handwriting was messy , difficult to discern . <p> " What are you telling Harry ? " My breath came back at me off her freckled , summery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Lizzie worked in a Head Start program in the mornings . " How many times Daddy took his glasses off when he gave his sermon . " <p> " How many ? " I aimed the tip of my tongue at the pale center of her vaccination scar . <p> " Seventeen . It was a short sermon . " She tucked stray hair behind her ear and then said , " You 're cramping my style . " <p> I withdrew my tongue and rolled onto my back . I gazed at Lizzie 's ear , the curve of it ending in that soft lobe with its tiny ring hole . I fingered the pack of Larks in the breast pocket of my shirt . Though I was a sophomore-to-be at a college in Tennessee , I was by any definition except , perhaps , a technical one , a virgin . Once , during my freshman year , I 'd gotten near-blind-drunk on grain-alcohol punch and found myself on top of a girl from Knoxville , who was also drunk and who kept saying , " Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel you . " <p> I listened to the air conditioner rattle in the window frame . It was ninety-something outside . In an hour , I had to be at my job . I worked the four-to-midnight shift at a lumbermill off Dixie Highway , stacking boards that came off a planer . It was a summer job  --  the lowliest at the plant , next to sweeping sawdust . I 'd chosen it over an offer to be a gofer boy for a firm of Republican lawyers . <p> I rolled off the bed and went to Lizzie 's desk and picked up the photo cube that sat on a pile of books . There was a picture of Lizzie and Harry as children : Lizzie , flashing slightly bucked teeth , in a puffy dress that made her look like a Christmas ornament , and Harry in blazer and tie , his hand on his sister 's shoulder . I rotated the cube to a picture of Lizzie in last year 's prom gown , her teeth straightened , her shoulders so bare I felt I could touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cube again , to a snapshot of Harry in jungle pants and army helmet , crouched beside a small black dog , sandbags in the background ; Harry was squinting , and he looked quizzical , the way dogs do when they tilt their heads to the side . <p> And then I studied the picture , taken that spring , of Lizzie as Mary the Maid in The Bald Soprano , her senior-class play . ( Her school employed an ambitious drama teacher . ) She wore a short black skirt with a frilly apron , and balanced uneasily on high heels . I thought she looked wonderful , even if she was dressed more like a cocktail waitress than a maid in a proper English home . The photograph was of the moment when she recited Mary 's poem for the Fire Chief . Her hands were clutched together at her waist , and her head was tilted upward , heavenward , as if ecstasy had descended on her and left her mouth agape . This was n't quite the first sign I 'd had that she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I opened the top drawer of Lizzie 's desk in the hope of finding I knew not what exactly . The letters I 'd written her from college that spring , letters all swollen with praise ( some of it borrowed ) for the parts of her I 'd been allowed to kiss ? <p> " What are you doing in my desk , Mr. Nosy ? " <p> " Rien . " I crossed the hall to Harry 's room . The blinds were pulled and the windows shut tight . The air felt ancient , as if it were being preserved for Harry to breathe when he came back . The two trophies on the bureau  --  both for swimming  --  gleamed faintly . A knotted necktie hung from a drawer knob . There were two crates of LPs on the floor , mostly jazz , mostly musicians I knew only by name . Harry was deep , though not in an academic way , judging by his failure to hold onto his student deferment . He had fallen behind at college and then dropped out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war . But when his draft notice arrived , he returned home . Lizzie said he 'd felt guilty . <p> I put a record on Harry 's portable Magnavox and sat in his beaten-up , wide-bottomed armchair and listened to Thelonious Monk play the piano . He played the melody in snatches and then nervously jumped away from it , like a man with a hundred worries . I closed my eyes . I thought of Harry crouching next to the little black dog in the Mekong Delta or wherever he was in that country of which my ignorance was extensive . ( I remember Lizzie reading me one of Harry 's letters in which there was a description of a sunset and thinking , There are sunsets in Vietnam ? ) Was n't dog considered a delicacy in Asia ? The dog and Harry vanished , and I saw myself lying naked on crisp white sheets at the Goshen Motor Court , waiting for a woman to come out of the bathroom , where she was washing her feet . <p> " Do you like it ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now sitting on my knees , her hands pinning mine to the armrests . She meant the music . <p> " Yeah , " I said . <p> " More than Buffalo Springfield ? More than Joni Mitchell in her big yellow taxi ? " <p> " Yeah . " <p> " Liar , " Lizzie said . " Pants are on fire . " <p> In Lizzie 's eyes , soft black islands encircled by blue-gray irises casting changeable light , I saw that she could n't say to herself that she found me undesirable , even if she could say I did n't impress her . In her mouth , in the ample fleshiness of it , I saw , or imagined I saw , her willingness to accept my devotions , at least until the end of the summer , when she went away to college . She was going to Chapel Hill on a scholarship . <p> I leaned forward to kiss Lizzie , but I was in an awkward position and she did n't meet me halfway and I could n't reach that far  --  or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her more accessible breast , a small wonder beneath her ribbed jersey . I was permitted to let my lips rest there a moment , like a child being offered consolation , long enough that I felt her nipple rise in response . Oh , I was allowed certain liberties , to use a phrase that even then was old-fashioned , but Lizzie would n't let go of her virginity easily . She had discussed me in her letters , and Harry had told her that you had to be careful whom you entrusted your soul to . ( I did n't say , I do n't want your soul , I just want your funny body . Temporarily . For the summer . ) At any rate , she was n't prepared to surrender herself to me " just because you have a boner and I have a vagina it can go into . " She laughed when she said that . Her frankness threw me , even made me blush . <p> When Lizzie pulled away , I saw the Reverend Burford in the doorway . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about his face , as if he did n't spend enough time in the sun . The lines in his forehead were abstruse . He looked damp and pale , not nearly as pink as the flesh-colored frames of his glasses . In fact , he had a midsummer cold . <p> " Lizzie , I think it would be better if you and Peter were not in your brother 's room . " He sniffled , tugged at his clerical collar . <p> Lizzie rose from my knees and brushed at herself , as if to shed the imprint of me . " We were just listening to one of Harry 's jazz records before Peter left . " <p> " It 's nice seeing you again , Peter , " the Reverend Burford said . <p> " Yessir , " I said , rising from the chair , wondering if the stiffness in my jeans was as evident to him as it was to me . I stuck my hands in my pockets and looked down at my bootless feet . <p> " I missed seeing your father at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reverend Burford said , taking a handkerchief out of his coat pocket . " Please give him and your mother my regards . " <p> " Yessir . " <p> " How 'd you get out of the draft , man ? " Red and I were pushing a cartload of hardwood into a storage room . Or rather I was pushing and Red was guiding me across the rutted concrete floor , down an aisle where there was nothing to breathe except planed lumber and air that had n't moved in months . The storage room was dim , like some sort of permanent twilight , even when the yellow bulbs in their wire cages were burning , as they were now . It was eight fifteen in the evening , fifteen minutes until dinnertime . <p> " Student deferment , " I said , sliding my safety glasses up my sweaty nose . <p> " How come you 're doing a dumb-ass job like this if you 're so smart ? " Red came to the back of the cart to help me push it the final ten yards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chin and around his mouth , the beginnings of a goatee , looked like sawdust stuck to his face , not quite real . As he leaned into the cart , the muscles in his arms flared beneath a cut-off football jersey he 'd worn just about every day I 'd known him . Nine days , to be exact . This was the first time we 'd had something like a conversation . <p> " Must be the money , " I said , hoping this would pass for a joke . I was n't going to say that I 'd been required by my parents to get a summer job , that I was working to be working , that I 'd never been anywhere near financial distress . <p> " I think you 're pulling my leg , " Red said . We walked back down the aisle and into the planing room with its high , girdered ceiling and doors you could drive a semi through . <p> I did n't know how old Red was . His hard , bony face suggested he he was older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( I looked barely old enough to drive a car . ) But he had freckles around his eyes , residue from a not-too-far-off boyhood . And his eyes were a mild blue . He had stringy hair  --  pinkish-red , like sun-baked clay  --  that was almost long enough to make me think he might be an ally . There were fewer than a handful of workers in the mill whose hair fell over their eartops . <p> " How 'd you get out of the draft ? " I asked . <p> He removed the work glove from his right hand and held up his fingers . " The trigger finger does n't look real useful , does it ? " It had been severed at the middle joint . " Ca n't even pick my nose with it . " He said he 'd cut it in shop class at high school . <p> He put his glove back on and said , " One more load before dinner . " He went down to his work station , singing " Whipping Post , " and switched on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boards of pine and maple and oak and walnut slid sideways down the belt , and Red fed them into the blade . I grabbed them as they shot across a steel-topped table , all hot and smooth , the flow of their grains exposed ; and then I piled them on a cart . It had taken me a while , and only after instruction from Red , to learn how to use the table as a lever and flip the boards onto the cart . But I still was n't quick , like Red . When both Red and I worked at my end of the table  --  sometimes a man named Boyd fed the planer  --  Red flipped the boards as if they were playing cards , making a neat stack . <p> Red shoved boards through the planer at a rate I could n't keep up with , and in a minute I was buried . I waved at him to turn off the machine , but he did n't acknowledge me . He was singing to himself . I started shouting , though I knew he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which was like ten lawnmowers going at once . I watched a load of black walnut slide past me onto the floor . Then the machine stopped . <p> From behind me came a voice . " Son , if you make any more messes like this , you 're going to have to find another line of work . " <p> The speaker was Mr. Roop , the foreman , who was known as Adolph because he bore a passing resemblance to Adolph Rupp , the University of Kentucky 's squat , jowly basketball coach . Mr. Roop was sitting in his motorized cart , sipping coffee , his round head hidden under a seed cap . <p> " Yessir , " I said . <p> " I 'll get him to quit playing with his pecker , do n't you worry , Mr. Roop , " Red said . He was helping me pick up the boards . <p> " You be sure you do , Cloverly . " That was the first time I heard Red 's last name ; I never did find out his Christian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ departed . " Sorry , " I said to Red . <p> " Some guy I know died in Vietnam because some fuckup in his platoon did n't do his job right . " Red glared at me . <p> " Sorry , " I said , though I did n't see the parallel between a wood mill in Louisville and the jungles of Vietnam . <p> " Do n't worry about it , Joe , " Red said , slapping me on the back . Joe , I later figured out , was short for Joe College . " Just keep your pecker clear of whirling blades . " He grinned , and I grinned back . <p> " Where are you and Lizzie going tonight , Peter ? " Mrs. Burford was tearing lettuce , dropping the pieces into a wood bowl on the kitchen table . Some of the pieces were as small as confetti . She was on her second scotch  --  second that I 'd seen , anyway . <p> " The movies , " I said . " Lizzie wants to see this one by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Crescent . " I glanced out the window above the sink . Lizzie was playing with Miles while the Reverend Burford tended the barbecue grill . She was wearing a sundress , her arms and legs covered by nothing more than smoky light . Watching her throw a ball to Miles quickened my desire for her . That she threw clumsily , as if her left arm operated independently of her brain , only made her more desirable . <p> " Harry took me to some Swedish movie at the Crescent just before he went off to boot camp , " Mrs. Burford said . " It was all pain and desolation . With subtitles I could n't make out half the time . " Mrs. Burford ceased tearing lettuce and picked up her drink . The bracelets on her wrist slid and jangled . She was a tall , thin woman , nearly a head taller than her husband . She wore her graying hair in a permanent wave , as if in the hope that it might divert attention from the signs of disintegration in her face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glimmers far out to sea . <p> I picked at the label on my beer bottle . " Do you like musicals ? " <p> " Musicals ? " she said , tilting her head as if there were something hidden in my question and she was trying to shake it loose . There was n't anything hidden . It was an empty-headed question , though I did see now how it might lead her away from the subject of Harry , who was all but present . There were pictures of him on the refrigerator , though none showed him in military dress . In one taken a couple days before he 'd been inducted , he had his arms around Lizzie and her friend Edie . Their faces were squeezed together like fruit in a bin . Harry 's hair was long , and it fell into his eyes , but it did n't hide his fear . <p> " Musicals ? " she said again , opening the refrigerator and leaning in . " I prefer them to Swedish dramas , if that 's what you mean . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me . " Why do n't you cut this up while I go put something on the hi-fi . " <p> She left the kitchen with her drink in hand . Was I supposed to slice that onion into rings or dice it ? Was it for the salad or the hamburgers ? <p> I heard the hi-fi needle land on a record and slide across an acre of grooves before settling on a man 's voice crooning behind strings . I looked out the window for Lizzie . She was standing next to her father , holding her dark hair off her neck , cooling it . <p> Mrs. Burford reentered the kitchen , the liquid in her glass a late-afternoon color . ( She 'd freshened it . ) The music , the solemn voice of the singer , seemed to have made her smaller , as if she was overwhelmed by it . Then I noticed she 'd taken off her shoes . <p> " I do n't suppose you and Lizzie listen to Frank Sinatra much . " She took the knife from me and began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I hear him on the radio sometimes . " With strings swelling behind him , Sinatra sang , " Now I even have to scratch my back myself . " <p> " I heard him at the armory in 1941 with the Dorsey band . The place was full of all these young men without dates . Stags , we called them . It was so hot and crowded I could hardly breathe . " She looked up from the onions , into , I imagined , the mists of the ' 40s . " Sinatra was just this tough little skinny kid then , not the casino rat he later became . He was a beautiful singer when he was younger . He made this record after Ava Gardner left him . " <p> I swallowed the last of my beer . When Mrs. Burford had offered it , she 'd said , " If you 're old enough to be drafted , you 're old enough to drink . " I gripped my empty bottle and listened to the record , trying to hear what Mrs. Burford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made me receptive . Then I saw her lift her head from her onion-chopping . She was crying  --  whether from the onions or the music or something else , I was n't sure . <p> Mrs. Burford wiped her cheeks with the back of her hand . Then she asked me to take the salad to the table on the side porch . There was nothing in the bowl besides the minced lettuce . <p> I stood under the slowly spinning fan on the porch and watched Miles run out of the yard in a hurry , as if he 'd just caught the scent of something juicier than the Reverend Burford 's hamburgers . Frank Sinatra was singing about a man alone in bed . The music seemed gravely wrought , if not overwrought , and I wanted to escape it and go have a cigarette . <p> When I came back into the kitchen , Mrs. Burford said , " What do you plan on doing if you 're drafted ? " She was at the sink , washing a head of broccoli . I could n't see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks before my eighteenth birthday , I 'd had some notion that I might file for conscientious objector status , though I 'd barely cracked the books about pacifism I 'd gotten from the library , and I knew in my heart I was n't going to cut it as a CO . When the time came to make an appearance at the Selective Service office , I 'd gone downtown and said , in effect , " You can have me when you need me . " The clerk , a woman with a Rhine-maidenish tower of hair , had smiled at me through a cloud of cigarette smoke . A few months later , after I 'd gone off to college , I 'd received my card and my deferment . I was 2-S . <p> " I guess I 'd go , " I said . " Probably . " I sat down at the table . <p> " You do n't sound very sure of yourself . " Her back was still turned . Her blouse had come untucked . <p> I touched the glass that held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the refrigerator . Would I have submitted to the government 's call and come home from Montreal ? Probably . <p> Mrs. Burford turned around , the wet broccoli in her hands , glistening , dripping on the floor . " I did n't hear what you said . " She 'd dried her eyes , but her face was clouded and dark , as if there were more bad weather on the way . <p> " I 'm hoping I do n't lose my deferment , " I said . " My lottery number is kind of low . " My number was forty-two . <p> " You should n't do what your heart tells you not to do . " She turned back to the sink . " Harry went because he said some poor kid would have to go if he did n't . He was trying to be noble . " <p> If I went to Vietnam , would Lizzie sleep with me as a parting gift ? I thought not . She was a girl with principles . <p> " Maybe you could take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's in the fridge . And the horseradish . My husband wo n't eat a hamburger without it . " <p> I found the bottles and carried them through the living room , where Sinatra was singing to the blue sofa where Lizzie and I sometimes sat , me with my boner , Lizzie with a Coke she sipped endlessly , and Miles at her feet . I set the bottles on the table , and when I looked up , I saw a car stopped in the street , a Falcon like my grandmother drove , with a woman in a golf skirt and visor standing beside it . She 'd hit Miles . I could see his black shape a few yards from her fender . I looked dumbly at Miles sprawled in the end-of-the-day heat , the fizzling haze , and then Lizzie ran by the porch , shouting , and I noticed the way her body moved inside her sundress . <p> Miles was still breathing . The Reverend Burford wrapped him in a sheet and lifted him into the back of his wood-paneled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a parishioner . Lizzie was weeping , tearing at herself because Miles was her responsibility while Harry was away , and she insisted on going with her father to the vet 's . There was blood on her hand , where she 'd stroked Miles , and on her cheek , where she 'd wiped her hand in despair . Mrs. Burford and I stayed behind . She had another scotch and then excused herself and went upstairs to her bedroom and did n't come back down . I helped myself to another beer and drank it on the blue sofa as the light leaked out of the day , as I felt my desire for Lizzie wane . <p> " You need to pick up the pace , boy , " Red said , " or you 're going to get your ass canned . " We were on a smoke break , sitting on low , improvised stools outside the planing shed , below a huge pile of shavings and other mill refuse . Boyd , who was feeding the planer that night , was sitting apart from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was dark , between ten and eleven . <p> I was tired and , not for the first time , on the verge of quitting . It gave me pleasure to imagine lying on my bed , listening to Thelonious Monk , my hand lolling next to a vent cool air poured through . I could almost hear the air flowing through the duct and Monk doing his odd sprung-rhythm thing . I 'd persuaded Lizzie to let me borrow a couple of Harry 's LPs . <p> Red dragged on his cigarette . " You getting laid enough ? " <p> I exhaled smoke and produced a noise like an assent . <p> " Maybe he 's a fairy , " Boyd said . He poured the last of a pint carton of chocolate milk down his throat and then let the carton fall to the dirt . According to Red , Boyd was a drifter . He did n't mix with others . At dinnertime , he went out to his car with his vending-machine sandwich and chocolate milk and ate there . <p> " Fairies get laid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go at it different . " <p> " You know that from experience , Red ? " Boyd pushed down on the carton with his work boot . <p> " I know that from seeing you and Adolph get it on in the back of that shit-for-wheels Fury of yours . I asked myself : Why ca n't they go to a darned motel if they want to do them things ? Was n't I telling you about that , Joe ? " Red jabbed me in the shoulder with the stub of his trigger finger . <p> I nodded in a way that I hoped might be imperceptible to Boyd and then saw him slowly rise from his seat , like some broken-down , pissed-off cowboy . Boyd was tall and bony , bonier even than Red . His hair receded from a wispy widow 's peak high on his forehead . I estimated his age at between thirty and fifty . <p> Boyd walked past without glancing our way and went into the planing shed and switched on the machinery . <p> " Fucking drifting alky trash , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " <p> A couple nights later , when we got paid , I drove Red to a twenty-four-hour gas station after work . The tires on his Camaro had been slashed . He punched the ceiling of my VW and swore , telling me what he planned to do to Boyd when he caught him . ( Boyd was long gone ; he 'd disappeared at the six o'clock break , after the paychecks had come around . ) The station would n't cash Red 's check , so I let him use my credit card and then drove him back to the mill and watched him put the new tires on . <p> As he tightened the bolts on the last tire , he said , " I know this girl Virgie who has a sister I could fix you up with . I owe you , so do n't say no . " <p> I did n't . <p> I went out with Lizzie the next night , as planned . She was in a cheerful mood . She 'd gotten a letter from Harry , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my cot , drinking warm beer , and listening to Johnny Cash on the radio in between choppers flying over . " He added , " I wish it was Billie Holiday instead of Johnny , but you ca n't have everything ( ha ha ) . " Lizzie wrote back to say that Miles was doing OK . The vet had amputated a leg that was crushed beyond repair , but Miles was now able to hobble around and find his way to the porkchop bones in the kitchen trash . <p> Lizzie and I went to see Jules and Jim at the Crescent , and then we drove to a wayside on River Road and sat on the damp ground under a buzzing streetlamp and watched the river flow by . We talked about the movie , about how the Jeanne Moreau character was too much for either of the men to handle by himself . I said I could n't see sharing a lover with somebody else . <p> " You ca n't have everything , " Lizzie said , laughing . Then she asked me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But I did as she asked . <p> She went through the contents  --  a photo of her , the combination to my athletic locker at school , my Standard Oil credit card  --  until she found what she wanted . She held it up to the light and read my Selective Service number and my Random Sequence number and my classification . Then she folded the card into quarters and put it in her mouth . She let it rest against her cheek for a moment , like a plug of tobacco , before she began chewing . <p> I watched in silence . I was opposed to the war  --  or , anyway , opposed to having to participate in it  --  but I 'd done little to declare my opposition , aside from taking part in a candlelight march at school . There was a whole army of us  --  upper-middle-class white boys with draft cards in our back pockets , hoping the war would end before our deferments expired . <p> " What does it taste like ? " I was trying to be cool . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , except for your signature , which tastes kind of inky . You want a bite ? " She stuck her tongue out ; in the juices of her mouth , the card had been reduced to little more than a spitball . <p> " No , thanks . " <p> She resumed chewing ; she chewed noisily , like a child making a show of her eating . <p> " You can do time for ' knowingly ' mutilating a card , " I said . I 'd read the fine print on the back . <p> " Here , " she said , leaning toward me . " Be a good boy and swallow . " She shoved the sodden wad into my mouth and then kissed me hard . She pushed at the card with her tongue , trying to steer it down my throat , until she started laughing . <p> I took the lump out of my mouth and put it in my pocket . " I 'll tell the draft board my girlfriend ate it , " I said . <p> " Be brave , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to fight in their shitty war . " <p> " Would you sleep with me then  --  before I went to jail , I mean ? " <p> " I 'd love you , " she said . " I 'd write you letters in jail . " She put her arm around me . <p> " It does n't matter . I 'm not going to get drafted anyway . " <p> I arrived late for Harry 's funeral and sat in the rearmost pew , next to the man who 'd taught Latin to Harry and ( later ) me in high school . Mr. Becker had also coached the swimming team , of which Harry had been captain in his senior year . He shared a hymnal with me and sang enthusiastically , in his emphatic Latin taskmaster 's baritone . My eyes strayed from the book to look for Lizzie , but I could n't see far enough forward through all the dark suits and saucer-shaped hats . I 'd not seen her since the night she ate my draft card . I 'd been going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Red had set me up with . <p> When the congregation sat for the reading of the lesson , I saw the back of Lizzie 's head . It seemed more remote than I had ever imagined it might become . I listened : " Behold , I show you a mystery ; we shall not all sleep , but we shall all be changed , in a moment , in the twinkling of an eye , at the last trump . " I read , responsively , the even-numbered verses of Psalm 131 , and then I went outside into the midday sunshine and took off my jacket and got into my car . <p> I lit a cigarette . I looked at the white doors of St. Timothy 's , the little flourish of a steeple poking at the pale sky , the hearse driver sitting on a foldup stool in the courtyard next to the sanctuary . I watched cars go down the street  --  traffic from another world , it seemed . I remembered that when I heard about Harry 's death  --  he stepped on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , getting ready to go see Cheryl . I listened as the bearer of the news , my mother , talked to me through the door . When she left , I finished brushing my teeth and worried a pimple and then wrote Lizzie a note , which , despite its brevity , I flattered myself to imagine was heartfelt . I dropped the note in the Burfords ' mailbox on my way out to Shively , where Red and Cheryl and her sister lived . This was my second date with Cheryl , who sold popcorn at the new Movieland on Dixie Highway . On our first , we 'd driven around with Red and Virgie , stopping at an all-night auto-parts store where Red wanted to look at tachometers , ending up at a party halfway to Fort Knox . Cheryl had a boyfriend , I found out , who was in Vietnam , and it came as a surprise to me when she took my hand and studied my palm and said , " Do n't worry . He wo n't kill you if we make it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his stool , and a couple minutes later the church 's white doors opened and six men hauled Harry 's coffin into the sunlight . I saw the Reverend Burford without his vestments  --  he had n't officiated  --  and then I saw Lizzie . She was holding her mother 's arm , moving unsurely , as if caught off guard by the brightness of the day . She did n't wear sunglasses or a hat , as her mother did . The sun was pouring down , cooking her to her roots , and she leaned against her mother for protection . <p> I had n't been the kind of person , I thought , whom Lizzie cared to lean into . What had I had to offer , after all , aside from my worshipful click , which , like some meddlesome , boorish third party , was always ready to interpose itself ? And so , about a week before I would learn of Harry 's death , I 'd gone to Shively for the first time . The next day I 'd left Lizzie a note  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was " seeing " someone else . I did n't expect her to answer , but she did . On legal-pad paper she wrote , in her jumbly left-handed script , " Happiness is a warm gun , n'est-ce pas ? " <p> People got into their cars , and then the hearse , like a great gleaming boat , pulled out into the street , and the procession to the cemetery began . I got in line behind the last car , a VW containing Edie and another of Lizzie 's friends , but when it turned left , I turned right , toward Shively . <p> " Do n't you know any girls , man ? " We were in Red 's Camaro , parked across the street from a package store , drinking short boys . Virgie and Red had had a fight , and he was in a dark mood . Cheryl was working at the theater . It was barely seven , the package-store neon buzzing in the lingering daylight . When I suggested we pick Cheryl up when she got off work , Red said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - he indicated the space between the bucket seats- " and jerk us both off . " He smirked at me through the bristly red fringe of his goatee . " I do n't know , Joe . I do n't think you ought to get too excited about Cheryl . She 'd screw pretty much anything with two legs , which is why I set you up with her in the first place . I could see you were in need . " <p> I remembered Cheryl saying , after we 'd made it for the second time , " You 're so quick . " And then she 'd kissed me , as if my being quick had n't mattered too much . This was two weeks ago , the afternoon of the funeral . We 'd driven from Shively to the Goshen Motor Court , and afterwards had lain on the stained sheets , watching a game show on a TV whose picture would n't stop rolling . The air conditioner produced only warm air , and at some point Cheryl had taken a shower and then left the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came back , with barbecue chips and a Moon Pie and two Orange Crushes , I was overcome by hunger for her . " Whoa , " she said , but she was under me before she could take a bite of anything . <p> I looked out the windshield . A man as skinny as a snake came weaving down the sidewalk . He was wearing an unbuttoned , puffysleeved paisley shirt and bell-bottoms that were slipping down his hips and a sashlike belt that fell to his knees . I thought he might weave himself right onto the hood of Red 's car , but he slid by . <p> " Thought that was Boyd for a second , " Red said . " Dressed up like a dipshit . " He pushed in the lighter and reached for his Raleighs , which were wedged between the visor and the roof . " So you are n't going to introduce me to any of your high-class girlfriends ? " <p> I 'd tried to keep from Red  --  and Cheryl  --  the fact that I lived in a wealthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and working-class Shively , as well as from the package store outside which we were now twiddling our thumbs . I 'd always driven out to Shively or , as on this evening , met Red in between . My economic status had become clear to Red when he 'd phoned me and Willie , the maid , had answered . <p> " OK , " I said . " That way . " I pointed in the general direction of Lizzie 's house . <p> We swung by my house first . My parents were out , and I invited Red in , but he declined : " Would n't want to dirty the carpet . " I got the two Monk LPs Lizzie had let me borrow and grabbed an unopened quart of scotch from a cabinet . When I presented Red with the bottle , he studied the two Scottie dogs on the label and said , " Woof ! Woof ! " Then he said , " Now show me where the long-legged women are hiding . " <p> We drove out of my thickly wooded neighborhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trees were younger and there was less space between houses . I told Red about Lizzie 's brother . I said I did n't know if she 'd be in the mood to ride around with us . <p> " Go ring the doorbell , man , " Red said . " I 'll cheer her up . " <p> I went up the Burfords ' brick walk with the albums . In my note to Lizzie about Harry , I 'd said she could call me whenever she wanted . In my arrogance , I 'd imagined she might come running to me in her grief . I liked Cheryl ; I liked the way she held me for those brief moments I was inside her  --  one hand on my neck , the other at the base of my spine , as if she were guiding me through some country waltz . I liked the frank but uncritical way she gazed at me and the way she said , when a certain C &W; singer came on the radio , " Oh , God , I love that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was prepared to give her up in the event Lizzie sought me out  --  not that Cheryl , if Red was to be believed , would have minded much . When Harry died , I 'd actually imagined that his hold on Lizzie might weaken , that she might see the usefulness of entrusting herself to me , if only temporarily . It was n't easy admitting defeat . I liked Cheryl 's large , soft , sweet breasts , breasts between which Moon Pie crumbs could get lost , but I 'd set my heart on Lizzie 's small , hard ones . <p> I rang the bell and peered through the screen into the unlighted front hall . I saw Miles lying at the other end , near the kitchen door . He did n't get up . Then I saw Lizzie , halfway up the stairs , gazing at me . Her stillness , the way she sat with her elbow on her thigh and her finger to her lips , startled me . The whole house seemed sunk in stillness , the way a house is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I said through the screen , " I should 've come to see you before now . " <p> " Why should you have ? What difference would it have made ? " She spoke so softly I could barely hear her . <p> " I brought the Monk records back . " Miles was twitching in his sleep , as if dreaming of catching rabbits . <p> " You can keep them , " she said . <p> I ran my finger around the doorknob . " Where are your parents ? " <p> " Daddy went on some church retreat thing in the Smokies . Mom 's upstairs . " <p> I heard Red 's radio  --  Eric Burdon singing " Spill the Wine . " I turned and saw Red standing beside the car , drumming on the roof . When I turned back and saw Lizzie on the stairs , like a child suspended in some purgatory , face cradled in her hands , I thought of delivering the apology I 'd prepared , or a brief version of it : " Forgive me , Lizzie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother died . " But I was stubborn enough not to , as stubborn as Lizzie had been in her resistance of my charmless attempts to possess her . <p> " We could go get stoned , " I said . " With my friend Red . " I nodded toward the street . <p> " A few nights after Harry died I went out with Edie and got drunk and puked right where you 're standing . " The recollection of puking where I was standing did n't please her enough to make her smile . <p> I picked at the mesh of the screen . <p> " How come you 're not out with your girlfriend ? " <p> " She 's not really my girlfriend , " I said . <p> " Easy come , easy go , right , pardner ? " Red had crept through the dusk to stand alongside me . He had tucked his football jersey into his jeans . <p> " This is Red , " I said , and Red said , " Hey ! " Miles awoke from his dream and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sniff us through the screen . Mrs. Burford called down to find out who was there , and Lizzie said it was just Peter and his friend . Red told Lizzie he was sorry to hear about her brother , and that he 'd had a friend whom the gooks had killed . <p> " I played football with this guy , " Red said . " We went swimming together all the time at this quarry . Once he bet me that he could stand in this field where grasshoppers were flying around and open his mouth and catch five in two minutes . He won , but he cheated . He had a fuckin ' huge mouth . " <p> Lizzie smiled a little . Eventually she went upstairs to tell her mother she was going out . She wore tennis shoes and a sundress and rode in the front seat . <p> Red decided we should go sit on the Big Four railroad bridge and watch the sun go down . The bridge , no longer used , was n't easily accessible from the Kentucky side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a downtown bridge and then drive back up the Indiana shore . Even though Red drove as if our lives hung in the balance , there was n't much left of the sunset by the time we parked . A few reddish-purple carcinogenic streaks at the bottom of the sky . <p> " We can watch the stars come out , " Lizzie said , almost cheerfully . She 'd drunk half a short boy on the way over . Red and I had passed the scotch back and forth . <p> " You 're so romantic , Lizzie , " I said . A blaze warmed my skull , but it did n't ease my regret for bringing Red and Lizzie together . <p> " He misses Cheryl , " Red said . " The fastest girl in the West . " We were walking on the railbed out to the bridge itself , with its immense steel spans holding up nothing . Red was on point , Lizzie was in the middle , and I brought up the rear . <p> " Cheryl , " Lizzie said , turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ties and the gaps between them . I could see the glimmer of the river below . Heights frightened me ; the fear took the top off my buzz and left me grim . <p> " We went to the Goshen , " I said . I did n't say that I 'd registered under the names Harry and Lizzie Burford . <p> " Motel love , " Lizzie said . <p> We walked to the center of the bridge . The evening was mild , and there was a breeze , which seemed more pronounced up there among all the cables and struts and arcing steel . It licked at Lizzie 's dress and hair . <p> Red sang , " Ooooh , baby , baby , it 's a wild world , " and then did a spastic boogaloo . He turned to Lizzie and said , " You want to climb up ? " <p> " Sure , " she said , as if climbing bridges were as simple as breathing . <p> " You 'll have a much better view of Indiana from up there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cupping the match against the wind . <p> " You can wait for us while we go up , " Red said " Play with yourself or something . " <p> All but the last glow of daylight had been sucked from the sky . The lights of downtown Louisville were on , and there was a sprinkling of lights along the Indiana shore . In the growing dark , the bridge seemed to lose its firmness , to become tracery in the sky . <p> Red and Lizzie went to the downriver side of the bridge and began to climb a ladder attached to the middle span . Red first , Lizzie second . <p> I flicked my cigarette away and followed . The rungs were more like handholds than steps  --  narrow U-shaped bars riveted into the beam . There were railings , but they were n't going to prevent anybody but a stunt man from falling to his death . I gripped the rungs , flattened my body against the available steel . Lizzie went up slowly . I stayed close , close enough that the crease behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any farther up her dress ; I did n't want to disturb my equilibrium . Fear was a chastening force . Nor , of course , did I look to either side of her . <p> " Lizzie , " I said . I did n't know what I was going to say , but I wanted to hear her voice instead of the wind , the sound of a boat puttering up the river , Red singing the refrain from that Cat Stevens song . She did n't answer . <p> " Lizzie , " I said louder . " What are you doing ? " <p> " Climbing a bridge . Saying to myself that poem the maid says in honor of the Fire Chief . " She stopped . We were perhaps halfway to the top . My mouth was at the level of her tennis shoe . She seemed to be quivering , unless it was me  --  or the bridge  --  that was moving . <p> " The men caught fire , the women caught fire , the birds caught fire , the fish caught fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , everything caught fire , caught fire . " I did n't know I knew the poem until I 'd said it . <p> " You skipped some lines , " she said . " ' The water caught fire , the sky caught fire , the ashes caught fire ' It 's a progression . " <p> " Mother dog ! " Red exclaimed . He was pleased by the height he 'd reached . <p> I noticed that the right rear edge of Lizzie 's right sneaker was worn down , a fact of no importance and yet one that struck me as poignant : she was a girl who would n't go through life on the balls of her feet . <p> " Lizzie , " I said . " What could I 've done to get you to sleep with me ? " The wind did n't carry away the self-pity in my voice . <p> " You could 've doped me up and raped me . " <p> " That would 've pleased you ? " <p> " I would 've been oblivious , but you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climbing . When she reached the top , she crawled along the beam to where Red was sitting and smoking , his feet dangling over the side . He held her arm as she unwound her long legs and settled next to him . He brushed something from her knee-bridge grit , I supposed . <p> " This is scary , " she said . I admired her honesty . <p> " Hold on to me , " Red said . <p> She asked about his severed index finger , and he told her how he 'd lost it . " It made me 4-F , " he said . " Saved my ass from getting shot off in some jungle . " <p> " Good for you , " she said . Her tone was n't bitter , but she let go of him , folded her hands in her lap . <p> " Shit , " Red said . " Sorry . " <p> I gripped a stanchion and looked out rather than down . The dark was almost complete . I saw a drive-in movie screen a mile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the screen were indecipherable , like bug remains on a headlight , Was the sound I 'd make when I hit the Ohio River two hundred feet below like Whap ? Whump ? But I was n't going to fall . I was going to crawl back down , slowly , not failing to place my foot where there was a rung . <p> <p> By DWIGHT ALLEN <p>
