I 'M GOING TO CHANGE INTO my overalls now , " I said , heading for the bedroom . <p> When you 're married to a god , you have to watch what you say . <p> " What an intriguing idea , " he said . He pointed at me . The next instant I lay on the ground , flatter than I was comfortable being , without the power of vision , and incapable of independent motion . My sense of touch had changed . I was aware of myself as a multitude of threads interwoven , with acres of thready skin . <p> When he picked me up and put me on , I sensed him as a series of textures and varying temperatures , moisture differences and body oils and sweat , skin and hair and heat . There was an excitation in just lying against him - perhaps the presence of his god power . I could tell as I touched him that he wore no other clothes than me . Half of me lay against much of him , conscious of many differences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open to the air , which was different from one height to the next , full of touches/ tastes I normally did n't perceive at all . <p> Even while I gave myself up to all these strange and wonderful sensations , to this new relationship with my husband that involved an intimacy we had never shared before , in my core ( wherever that was in this body ) anger grew , starting as a sullen ember of heat , flaring higher as minutes passed and I remained in this shape without having been asked , without the power to ask to change back . <p> Had I known before I married the man that he was a god , I would have thought longer and harder about my answer to his proposal . Though I could n't move , I was conscious of motion ; I knew my husband walked and sat with me wrapped around him . We went somewhere in the car : I could feel the vinyl upholstery slick against parts of me , though at first I did n't know what it was . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though I were slave or adornment . Where was he wearing me ? Who would see us ? What was my husband saying about it ? Usually I liked his sense of humor - when I could hear it to appreciate it . He had a mean streak , though . From reading myths , one gets the feeling this is a chronic problem with gods . <p> Perhaps he was even now telling someone the truth about me . I would n't put it past him . None of his beer buddies would believe it , but my husband would laugh , knowing he had handed over an unruly secret that , if believed , could hurt both of us . <p> A hand that felt different from my husband 's in texture , composition , and temperature slapped some part of me for which I had no name . Someone I could n't see , someone to whom I did n't know whether I had ever been introduced , had touched me . Anger spread through my every thread . The touch was not unpleasant or invasive or harmful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband should n't have put me in this position . <p> Yet what could I do ? <p> Well , what could I do ? <p> I unmeshed my threads . Anger gave me the power of fray . I let myself go over and over again . <p> I do n't know how long this orgy of disintegration lasted . It frightened me while I was in the midst of it - what if I could never recollect myself again ? As connections unraveled I grew farther away from myself . Thoughts and intentions fragmented . <p> Let him stand there naked , wherever he is , I thought while I still could . It was n't much of a revenge - he had talked himself out of much worse situations , and nakedness did n't bother him . It was what was in my power , the best and worst that I could do . <p> Near the end I understood this was a decision I might never recover from , but I could n't reverse it . I was n't sure I wanted to . <p> There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more of me piled . <p> Before I could make sense of these new tastes , I lost track of myself and subsided into some lower state of consciousness where thoughts traveled through me without ever rubbing together . <p> I OPENED EYES , and thought how strange that was . Light and shadow mixed and sorted into some kind of view . I blinked . Eyelids ! It took time for me to understand what I was looking at . Intense dark squares and rectangles with colors in them , scattered over a light yellow background . Our bedroom wall , impressionist prints tacked up , all our favorites . Whenever we got tired of one , my husband could change it by willing it to be something else . <p> I lay on our bed , aware of the sheets above and below me in all their myriad threads , warm but unalive . <p> The bed dipped as my husband sat beside me . His face was pale . " What got into you ? " he said , his voice hoarse . " I had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond me ! " <p> Despair flooded me . If he had indeed created me , how was I ever going to escape his control ? <p> Was I even myself ? What if he had put me back together but had forgotten some important pieces , or left out things he had never liked ? <p> I lay without speaking for some time , exploring myself . If anything was gone , I could n't tell . <p> I would never be able to tell . <p> He touched my cheek . I could feel his hand 's warmth , but gone was the ability to sense intimately the whorls on his fingertips , the sweat and fear that touched his palm . " Eva , " he said , " what happened ? " <p> " I agreed to love and honor you , " I said , " not to be your clothes . " <p> " It was just a joke ! " <p> " It stopped being funny when someone else touched  --  scratch that ! I did n't think it was funny from the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a while , gazing toward the wall . " I did n't mean anything by it . " <p> " You never do . " <p> " I promise never to do it again , " he said . I sighed . <p> That night he went out . I wanted him to . He had stayed by me for several hours , just touching me , occasionally apologizing until I told him to stop that , it was all right , I knew he had n't intended to hurt me . <p> After he left , I lay and thought about being thread , being cloth , finally let myself appreciate how different and strange that had been . Before I knew my husband , I had never felt anything like this . And I used to thrive on novelty . <p> I rose and got a suitcase down from an upper closet shelf and set it open on the bed . I pulled out my dresser drawers and took underwear and socks out , one pair at a time , placing them in the suitcase . The cloth tingled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ related . <p> I did n't want to have this attitude toward clothes . I wanted them to go back to just being things I could wear without thinking about it . Perhaps this uncomfortable association would fade . Though my affinity for cats had n't changed since the night that my husband ... <p> ... and I still felt an unreasoning terror every time I heard a chainsaw start .... <p> I took my red silk blouse out of the closet and stroked it over my forearm . Smooth and slippery as water . It would n't pack well - it would wrinkle . I folded it in half , then sat on the bed holding it in my lap , resting my hands on fabric . <p> Did I really want to leave ? <p> He was always sorry afterward . <p> This time I had come so close to self-destruction . Could I stay with my husband and survive ? <p> I stroked the blouse , brought it up to touch the silk against my cheek . <p> So soft , so almost not there . So much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had been there . <p> My husband would never turn me into clothes again ; he had promised . But there would be something else . And something else after that . <p> I folded up the blouse and put it in the suitcase , then reached into the closet for my favorite comfortable cotton dress . <p> He came into the room . " What are you doing , Eva ? " <p> I sat down next to my open suitcase . " I do n't know , " I said . <p> " Are you leaving ? " <p> " I do n't know . " <p> " You 're the best wife I ever had , " he said . " I do n't want to lose you . I hate being between wives ; it 's hard to find a good one . " <p> This was another thing I had learned only after we married . My husband was more than three thousand years old , and he had n't spent many years in a single state . I gave up thoughts of jealousy early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I could tell that for the present , he was devoted to me . <p> " For better or for worse does n't mean what it used to , " he said , sitting down beside me . <p> " Did you treat your other wives the way you treat me ? " <p> " Some of them , " he said , " liked it . " <p> " Those were different times , " I said . <p> " Yes . " <p> " Women like that are probably still around . I 'm not one of them . " <p> " How can we work this out ? " he asked . <p> When I went to work on Monday it was all I could do to keep it together . I kept wanting to laugh . They 're very serious at the law firm where I 'm the receptionist , and I knew laughing would get me in trouble . But I could n't help it . <p> I managed the morning . I managed my lunch break , even sitting there with Rhoda and eating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I held it together . It was in the afternoon when I lost it . <p> Mr. Gill was a dissatisfied client who had come in several times to give me a hard time . I was the one who kept sending him bills , and he did n't see why he should pay his lawyer when the judgment had gone against him . <p> He was n't physically threatening , but he was always verbally abusive . The partners had told me to call witnesses and cops the next time he came in , but this afternoon I was laughing too hard . He yelled at me and called me names , and I laughed . <p> Then I pointed at him . <p> There 's no way he can pay us back in his present state , but he gives the office some much needed color . People stop to smell him . I wonder if he likes that . <p> I 'm starting to appreciate my husband 's sense of humor more <p> Author Affiliation             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
