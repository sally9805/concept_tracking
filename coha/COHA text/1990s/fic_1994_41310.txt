At the Spring Festival Hao Nan was very happy , because a week before he had been engaged to Soo Yan , one of the pretty girls in Flag-Pole Village . She was tall and literate . By custom , the dowry would cost the Haos a fortune : eight silk quilts , four pairs of embroidered pillows , ten suits of outer clothes , five meters of woolen cloth , six pairs of leather shoes , four dozen nylon socks , a wristwatch , two thermos bottles , a sewing machine , a bicycle , a pair of hardwood chests . Yet Nan 's parents were pleased by the engagement , for the Soos were a rich family in the village and Yan was the only daughter . The wedding was scheduled to take place on the Moon Day the next fall . Though the Haos did n't have much money left after the engagement feast , they were not worried . Since they had two marriageable daughters , they would be able to marry off at least one of them to get the cash for Nan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Spring Festival . Nan and four other young men were on duty at the office of the village militia . Because the educated youths from Dalian had returned home to spend the holiday season with their families in the city , the young villagers had to cover all the shifts . It was a good way of making ten work points  --  a full day 's pay , so nobody complained . Besides , it was an easy job . For eight hours they did n't have to do anything except stay in the office and make one round through the village . <p> Outside , a few snowflakes were swirling like duck down around the red lanterns hung at every gate . The smell of gunpowder and incense lingered in the air . Firecrackers exploded now and then , mingled with the music of a Beijing opera sent out by a loudspeaker . Inside the militia 's office , the five men were a little bored , though they had plenty of corn liquor , roasted sunflower seeds , and candies with which to while away the time They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Liu Daiheng and Mu Bing wanted to stop to play chess by themselves , but the others would n't let them . There was no fun if only three men drew the cards , and they wanted to crown two kings and beat two queens every time . <p> Slowly the door opened . To their surprise , Sang Zhu 's bald head emerged , and then in came his small body and bowlegs . " Hello , k-k-Uncle Sang , " Nan said with a clumsy smile , which revealed his canine teeth . <p> Without answering , Sang glared at Nan , who had almost blurted out his nickname Cuckold Sang . People called him that because his young wife , Shuling , often had affairs It was said that she was a fox spirit and always ready to seduce a man . People thought that Sang , already in his fifties and almost twice his wife 's age , must have been useless in bed . At least he did n't have sperm , or else Shuling would have given him a baby . <p> Sang was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baggy eyes bloodshot . " Uncle Sang , " Wang Ming said , " take a seat . " Without a word , Sang sat down and put his elbows on the table . <p> They needed a sixth person to play the game One Hundred Points . <p> " Want to join us ? " Nan asked . <p> " No poker , boys , " Sang said . " Give me something to drink " Yang Wei poured him a mug of corn liquor . " Here you are , " he said , winking at the others . <p> " Good , this is what I need . " Sang raised the mug to his lips and almost emptied it in one gulp . " I came here for serious business tonight . " <p> " What is it ? " Daiheng asked . <p> " I invite you boys over to fuck my wife , " Sang said deliberately . <p> All the young men were taken aback , and the room suddenly turned quiet except for the sputtering of the coal stove . They looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 're kidding , Uncle Sang , " Daiheng said , after a short while . <p> " I mean it . She 's hot all the time . I want you to give it to her enough tonight . " Anger inflamed Sang 's eyes . <p> Silence again fell in the room . <p> " Afraid to come , huh ? " Sang asked , his sparse brows puckered up . A smile crumpled his sallow face . <p> " Sure , we 'd like to come . Who would n't ? " said Ming , who was a squad leader in the militia . <p> " Well , sometimes heaven does drop meat pies , " Bing said , as if to himself . <p> " No , we should n't go , " Nan cut in , scanning the others ' faces with his narrow eyes gleaming . He turned to Sang and said , " It 's all right to do it to your wife , Uncle Sang , but that could be dangerous to us . " Turning to the others , he asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? You fellas do n't want to get into that kind of trouble , do you ? " <p> His words dampened the heat in the air . For a moment even the squad leader , Wang Ming , and Liu Daiheng , the oldest of them , did n't know what to say . Everybody remained silent . What Nan had referred to was a case in which a prostitute had been screwed to death by a bunch of brickmakers . Of course , prostitution was banned in the new China , but there were always women selling their flesh on the sly . That woman went to the brickyard once a month and asked for five yuan a customer , which was a big price , equal to two days ' pay earned by a brickmaker . That was why the men would n't let her off easily . They gave her the money but forced her to work without a stop . As they had planned , they kept her busy throughout the night , and even after she lost consciousness they went on mounting her . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrested all the men . Later three of them were sentenced to eight years in prison . <p> " Nan 's right . I do n't think we should go , " Wei said at last . <p> " You 're no man , " Sang said with a sneer , stroking his beardless chin . " I invite you boys to share my wife , free of charge , but none of you dare come . Chickens ! " <p> " Uncle Sang , if you want us to come , " Daiheng said , " you ought to write a pledge . " <p> " But I do n't know how to write . " <p> " Good idea . We can help you with that , " Ming said . <p> " All right , you write and I 'll put in my thumbprint . " <p> Ming went to the desk , pulled a drawer , and took out a pen and <p> piece of paper . He sat down to work on the pledge . <p> Nan felt uneasy about the whole thing . How could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife ? he asked himself . I would n't . Never . Shuling must 've had an affair with someone lately and have been caught by Cuckold Sang . They must 've had a big fight today . <p> Sang was dragging at his pipe silently . Sitting beside him , Bing was putting the poker cards back into the box . <p> " Here , " Ming said , walking over with the paper , " listen carefully , Uncle Sang . " Then he read aloud with his eyebrows flapping up like a pair of beetle wings : <p> On the third eve of the Spring Festival , I , Sang Zhu , came to the Militia 's Office and invited five young militiamen  --  Hao Nan , Liu Daiheng , Yang Wei , Mu Bing , and Wang Ming  --  to have sex with my wife Niu Shuling . By doing this , I mean to teach her a lesson so she will stop seducing other men and be a chaste woman in the future . If any physical damage is done to her in the process of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsible . I , Sang Zhu , the husband , will bear all consequences . <p> The Pledger : <p> Sang Zhu <p> Wei placed the ink-paste box on the desk . " Put in your thumbprint if you agree , Uncle Sang . " <p> " All right . " Sang pressed his ringworm-nailed thumb into the ink , took it out , blew on its pad , and stamped a scarlet smudge under his name . He wiped off the ink on the leg of his cotton-padded trousers , which were black but shiny with grease stains . Turning away from the table , he blew his nose ; two lines of mucus landed on the dusty floor . <p> " Now , let 's go , " Ming said , and motioned to the others as though they were going off to bag a homeless dog , which they often did on night patrol . <p> Nan felt unhappy about the pledge , because Ming , the son of a bitch , had put Nan 's name the first and his own name the last among the group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At least , it read that way on paper . He was merely a small soldier , whereas Ming was a leader . <p> The snow stopped , and the west wind was blowing and would have chilled them to the bones if they had not drunk a lot of liquor . Each of them was carrying a long flashlight , whose beam now stabbed into the darkness and now hit a treetop , sending sleeping birds on the wing . They were eager to reach the Sangs ' , get hold of that loose woman , and overturn the rivers and seas in her . In raptures they could n't help singing . They sang " I Am a Soldier , " " Return to My Mother 's , " " Our Navigation Depends on the Great Helmsman , " " Without the Communist Party There Would Be No New China . " In the distance , soundless firecrackers bloomed in the sky over Sea Watch Village . The white hills and fields seemed vaster than they were in daylight . The first quarter of the moon wandered slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear and quiet except for the men 's hoarse voices vibrating . <p> Nan followed the other men , singing , and he could n't help imagining what it would feel like to embrace a woman and have her body under his own . He thought of girls in the village , and also of Soo Yan . Though they were engaged , he had never touched her , not even her hand . This was an opportunity to learn how to handle a woman . <p> They entered Sang 's yard . A dark shadow lashed about on the moonlit ground and startled Ming and Daiheng , who were at the front of the group . Then a wolfhound burst out barking at them . " Stop it ! " Sang shouted . " You beast that does n't know who owns you Stop it ! " <p> The dog ran away toward the haystack , scared by the beams of the flashlights scraping its body . The yard was almost empty except for a line of colorful washing , frozen and sheeny , swaying in the wind like landed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pink shirt , which was apparently Shuling 's , and said , " It smells so delicious . Why no red on this , Old Sang ? She 's too young for menopause , is n't she ? " <p> They broke out laughing . <p> Sang 's little stone house had a thatched roof . Entering it , they put their two rifles behind the door . An oil lamp was burning on the dining table on the brick bed , but nobody was in . Finding no woman , the men began swearing and said they were disappointed . Sang searched everywhere in the house , but there was no trace of his wife . " Shu  --  ling  --  " he cried to the outside . Only the hiss of the wind answered . <p> " Old Sang , what does this mean ? " Daiheng asked . " What do you have in mind exactly ? " <p> " I want you to do it to my wife . " <p> " But where is she ? " Bing asked . <p> " I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back soon . " Sang 's eyes were filled with rage . Obviously he did n't expect to see an empty house either . He took a large bowl of boiled pork and a platter of stewed turnips from the kitchen and placed them on the table . They climbed on the brick bed and started eating the dishes and drinking the liquor they had brought along . <p> " It 's too cold , " Wei said , referring to the food . <p> " Yes , " Ming said . " Let 's have something warm , Old Sang . We have work to do . " <p> " You must treat us well , " Bing said , " or else we wo n't leave tonight . This is our home now . " <p> " All right , all right , you boys do n't go crazy . I 'm going to cook you a soup , a good one . " <p> Sang and Daiheng went to the kitchen , lighting the stove and cutting pickled cabbages and fat pork . In the village Daiheng was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work naturally . <p> " Do n't be stingy . Put in some dried shrimps , " Wei shouted at the men in the kitchen . <p> " All right , we will , " Sang yelled back . <p> Nan remained silent meanwhile . He did n't like the tasteless meat and just kept smoking Sang 's Glory cigarettes and cracking roasted melon seeds . In the kitchen the bellows started squeaking . <p> Ming and Wei were playing a finger-guessing game , which Nan and Bing did n't know how to play but were eager to learn . Nan moved closer , watching their hands changing shapes deftly under the oil lamp and listening to them chanting aloud : <p> A small chair has square legs , <p> A little myna has a pointed bill . <p> It 's time you eat spider eggs , <p> Drink pee and gulp swill . <p> Five heads , Six fortunes , Three stars , Eight gods , Nine cups- <p> " Got you ! " Ming yelled at Wei . Pointing at a mug filled with liquor , he ordered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished the second round when Daiheng and Sang rushed in . " She 's here . She 's here , " Daiheng whispered , his voice in a flutter . <p> Before they could straighten up , Shuling stepped in , wearing a red scarf and puffing out : warm air . She whisked the snowflakes off her shoulder with a pair of mittens and greeted the men . " Welcome , " she said . She looked so fresh with her pink cheeks and permed hair . Her plump body swayed a little against the white door curtain , as if she did n't know whether she should stay in or go out . <p> " Well , well , well , " Ming hummed . <p> " Where have you been ? " Sang asked sharply , then went up to her and grabbed the front of her sky-blue jacket . <p> " I , I  --  let me go . " She was struggling to free herself . <p> " I know where you were . With that pale-faced man again . Tell me , is that true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He referred to a young cadre on the work team which was investigating the graft and bribery among the leaders of the production brigade . Nan remembered seeing that man and Shuling together in the grocery store once . <p> " Let me go . You 're hurting me , " she begged , and turned to the others , her round eyes flashing with fear . <p> " You stinking skunk , always have an itch in your cunt ! " Sang bellowed . " I want you to have it enough today , as a present for the Spring Festival . See , I have five men for you here . Every one of them is strong as a bull . " His head tilted to the militia . <p> " No , do n't . Please do n't , " she moaned with her hands held together before her chest . <p> " What are you waiting for , boys ? " Sang shouted at the young men . <p> They all jumped up and went to hold her . " Brothers , do n't do this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to her ! Teach her a good lesson , " her husband yelled . <p> They grabbed her limbs and carried her onto the brick bed . She struggled and even tried to kick and hit them , but like a tied sheep she could n't move her legs and arms . Daiheng pinched her thigh as Ming was rubbing her breasts with his hand . " Not bad , " Ming said , " not flabby at all . " <p> " Oh , you hooligans . Let your grandma go . Ouch ! " <p> With laughter , they placed her on the hard bed . She never stopped cursing , " All your ancestors will go to hell . Sons of asses ... I 'll tell your parents .... Your houses will be struck by thunderbolts ! You 'll die without a son .... " <p> Her curses only incensed the men Bing rolled one end of her woolen scarf into a ball and thrust it into her mouth . Instantly she stopped making noises . Then Sang produced some ropes and tied her hands to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nan , as they were told by Ming , were binding her feet to the beam that formed the edge of the bed . <p> They slipped their hands underneath her underclothes , kneading her breasts and rubbing her crotch . Then they ripped open her jacket , shirts , pants , and panties . Her partly naked body was squirming helplessly in the coppery light . <p> Daiheng took out five poker cards , from 1 to 5 , mixed them and then put them on the bed . By turns they picked the cards . Wei had " 5 , " Nan " 4 , " Bing " 3 , " Daiheng " 2 . " As Ming got " 1 , " he was to do it first . <p> " All right , " Sang said calmly , " everything is fine . Now you boys enjoy yourselves . " He raised the door curtain and went out . <p> Ming began to mount Shuling , saying , " I 've good luck this year . Nan , little bridegroom , watch your elder brother carefully and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondering whether Daiheng had contrived a trick in dealing out those cards . How come both Ming and Daiheng had got ahead of the three younger men ? But he did n't attend to his doubt for long , since soon Ming 's lean body was wriggling violently on Shuling 's . Having never seen such a scene , Nan felt giddy and short of breath , but he was also eager to experience it . They all watched intently . Meanwhile the woman kept her face away from them . <p> While Daiheng was on Shuling , biting her shoulders and making happy noises , Sang came in with a small enamel bowl in his hand . He climbed on the bed and placed it beside his wife 's head . He clutched her hair and pulled her face over , and said , " Look at what 's in the bowl . " He picked up a bit of the red stuff with three fingers and let it trickle back into the bowl . " Chili powder . I 'll give it to you . Wait , after they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , to cure the itch in there for good . " <p> His wife closed her eyes and shook her head slightly . <p> Bing , who was the third , obviously had no experience with a woman before . No sooner had he got on top of her than he came and gave up . He held his pants , looking painful as though having just swallowed a bowl of bitter liquid medicine . He coughed and blew his nose . <p> Now it was Nan 's turn . He seemed bashful as he moved to that body . Though this was his first time , he felt himself having enough confidence . He straddled her and started unbuckling his pants . He looked down at her body , which reminded him of a huge frog , tied up , waiting to be skinned for its legs . Looking up , he noticed that her ear was small and delicate . He grabbed her hair and pulled her face over to see closely what she looked like . She opened her eyes , which were full of sparkling tears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fierce eyes but could not help observing them . Somehow her eyes were changing  --  the hate and the fear were fading , and beneath their blurred surfaces loomed a kind of beauty and sadness that was bottomless . Nan started to fantasize , thinking of Soo Yan and other pretty girls in the village . Unconsciously he bent down and intended to kiss that pale face , which turned aside and spilled the tears . His head began swelling . <p> " What are you doing ? " Daiheng shouted at Nan . <p> Suddenly a burst of barking broke out beyond the window . The wolfhound must have been chasing a fox or a leopard cat that had come to steal chickens . Wild growls and yelps filled the yard all at once . <p> " Oh ! " Nan cried out . Something snapped in his body ; a numbing pain passed along his spine and forced him off her . By instinct , he managed to get to his feet and rushed to the door , holding his pants with both hands . Cold sweat was dripping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he dropped to his knees and began vomiting . In addition to the smell of the half-cooked cabbage soup in the cauldron , the room was instantly filled with the odor of alcohol , sour food , fermented candies , roasted melon seeds . His new cotton-padded shoes and new Dacron jacket and trousers were wet and soiled . " Little Nan , come on ! " Daiheng said . Putting his hand on Nan 's head , he shook him twice . <p> " I 'm scared . No more , " Nan moaned , buckling his belt . <p> " Scared by a dog ? Useless , " Sang said , and restrained himself from giving Nan a kick . <p> " Come on , Nan . You must do it , " Ming said . " You just lost your Yang . Go get on her and have it back . Or you 've lost it for good , do n't you know that ? " <p> " No , no , I do n't want to . " Nan shook his head , groaning . " Leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes to get rid of the mist caused by the dizziness . His hands were slimy . <p> " Let that wimp do what he wants . Come back in , " Sang said aloud , straddling the threshold . <p> They went in to enjoy themselves . " Ridiculous , scared by a dog , " Wei said , giggling and scratching his scalp . <p> Holding the corner of the caldron range in the dark , Nan managed to stand up , and he staggered out into the windy night . <p> As Ming said , Nan lost his potency altogether . In fact , he lay in bed for two days after that night when he had walked home bareheaded through the flying snow . At first , he dared not tell his parents what had happened , but within a week the entire village knew Nan had been frightened by Sang 's dog and had lost his Yang . His father scolded him a few times , while his mother wept in secret . <p> Two weeks later , the Soos returned to the Haos the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ items of the dowry already in Yan 's hands , saying Nan was no longer a normal man , so they would n't marry their daughter to him . Despite Mrs. Hao 's imploring , the Soos refused to retain the expensive gifts . However , they did say that if Nan recovered within half a year they might reconsider the engagement . <p> For four months Nan had seen several doctors of Chinese medicine in town . They prescribed a lot of things to restore his manhood : ginseng roots , sea horses , angelica , gum dragon , deer antler , tiger bones , royal jelly , even a buck 's penis , but nothing worked . His mother killed two old hens and stewed them with ginseng roots . Nan ate the powerful but almost inedible dish ; the next day he had a bleeding nose and soon began losing his hair . His father cursed him , saying the Hao clan had never had such a nuisance . Indeed , after eating two or three slices of buck 's penis , a normal man would n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing could help Nan . There was no remedy for such a jellyfish . <p> By now the villagers no longer counted Nan as a man . Lots of children would call out " Dog-Scared " when they ran into him . Though quite a few matchmakers visited the Haos , they all came for his sisters . Among all the unfilial things , the worst is childlessness . But what could Nan do ? He used to think of poisoning Sang 's wolfhound , but even that idea did n't interest him anymore . One afternoon , when he was on his way to the pig farm , that dog came to him , lashing its tail and wagging its tongue . He wanted to give it a kick , but he noticed Soo Yan walking two hundred meters away along the edge of the spinach field ; so instead he threw his half-eaten corn cake to the dog , who picked it up and ran away . Nan watched the profile of that girl . She wore cream-colored clothes , her fiery gauze scarf waving in the breeze . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a red-crowned crane moving against the green field . <p>
