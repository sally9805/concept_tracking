<p> Several of the country 's top high school players will be making their college choices today , as the one-week early signing period for basketball begins . But the player some recruiters regard as the nation 's best wo n't be among them . <p> Donnell Harvey , a 6-foot-8 , 225-pound power forward from Randolph-Clay High in Cuthbert , will wait until spring to make his decision . Harvey , rated the No. 1 prospect nationally by The Sporting News in a recent composite poll of five recruiting analysts , is working to improve his academic transcripts and college-entrance test scores . <p> " He 's still wide open right now , " Randolph-Clay coach Joe Williams said . " I do n't think he 's going to sit down and do anything until he gets his test scores . " <p> Harvey , a fourth-team Parade All-America selection last year , averaged 17.4 points , 14.8 rebounds and three blocks per game as a junior . Harvey 's stock soared this summer with exceptional performances at the Adidas/ ABCD Camp in Teaneck , N.J. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He 's a Dennis Rodman without the tattoos , " said Bob Gibbons , the North Carolina-based recruiting analyst . " Donnell 's a warrior . Over the years , one of the difficult things for me has been to look inside a player 's heart . But there 's no mystery here . This kid just loves to play the game . " <p> Harvey 's size and potential have coaches from coast to coast flocking to the tiny South Georgiatown . Harvey says he has narrowed his list of schools to five  --  Georgia , Clemson , Auburn , Alabama and Florida . Harvey recently eliminated Georgetown , Connecticut and Texas . Kentucky and Georgia Tech apparently backed off because of his apparent academic difficulties . Harvey 's only official visit has been to Georgia ; he will make an unofficial visit to Florida this weekend . <p> Clemson could have the inside track on Harvey after landing former Mitchell-Baker High star Ronald Blackshear , a close friend of Harvey who is attending Hargrave Military Academy in Virginia this year . The pair attended Midnight Madness at Clemson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harvey also is good friends with Georgia forward Jumaine Jones . <p> " I do n't have a leader , " Harvey said . " Whatever school I attend will be my choice . " <p> Harvey 's quick ascent started three years ago when Wallace Prather Jr. , coach of the Atlanta Celtics , the city 's top AAU basketball program , was combing the state in search of a big man . That 's when Prather caught his first glimpse of Harvey . By mistake . <p> Prather had traveled to Cuthbert to scout Randolph-Clay guard Jeffrey Braswell , who was described as a " can't-miss " prospect by Williams . Instead , Prather found Harvey , a lanky , awkward forward with unpolished skills . <p> " After I got down there , their coach asked me to take a look at Donnell , " Prather recalled . " Immediately , I saw that he had the potential to be a great basketball player . At the time , there was really a drought of big men in the state . We 'd been playing on the national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide body in the paint . " <p> Now , as Harvey prepares for his final prep season , he 's the one attracting the interest of nearly every top Division I program . <p> " He 's so quick that there 's very few big men that he reminds you of , " Prather said . " He 's working on his perimeter game , so he 's starting to develop the characteristics of Dominique Wilkins . But he 's such a great rebounder , that he reminds me of Bill Russell . Somehow , he tends to get his hands on about all the rebounds if they 're in the proximity of his reach . " <p> " Rebounding just comes easy to me , " Harvey said . " We have some other scorers on my team and we just go out and play . I 'm not worried about my statistics . That 's why I love Dennis Rodman , because he goes out and plays hard every game . " <p> But the Rodman comparisons stop with Harvey 's size , extremely long arms and rebounding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's flamboyance ; he 's soft-spoken  --  on and off the court . <p> " He 's a totally unselfish kid that 's not as interested in scoring as he is in rebounding , " said Karl McCray , director of Atlanta 's Bureau of Recreation , which oversees the city 's AAU program . " He 's very low-key . He 's not very talkative , he 's almost shy and you 've got to pull things from him . He wo n't get on the court and start bragging or taunting . " <p> Harvey attributes his modesty to his upbringing . He shares a home in Shellman , which is just minutes from the high school , with his mother , Laura Powell , and two brothers , Diedrick and Travious . Harvey 's parents are separated , and his mother works a 12-hour night shift at a manufacturing plant in nearby Eufaula , Ala . <p> Donnell and Diedrick , who now attends East Mississippi Junior College in Scooba , Miss. , played one season of varsity basketball together at Randolph-Clay . Diedrick also hopes to earn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alabama . <p> " We 've talked about going to the same school , " Diedrick Harvey said . " When we were younger , we 'd go at it a lot on the courts , but then he outgrew me . " <p> Both players developed their skills in pickup games at a local park . Donnell was a late bloomer and did n't start playing basketball competitively until the sixth grade . He says his first love was football because of its physical nature  --  he was always much bigger than his classmates , earning him the nickname , " Big Donnie . " Basketball did n't come as easy , though , as he spent his first two years on the junior-varsity team on the bench . He finally earned a starting role on the varsity squad . <p> " I had to work hard to get where I am today , " Donnell Harvey said . " I just had problems playing early . I had problems getting on the court . I was n't playing  --  period . " <p> Two years ago , Harvey caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he delivered a monstrous dunk over NBA-bound Rashard Lewis , a 6-10 center from Alief-Elsik High in Alief , Texas . <p> " Lewis made an effort to defend Donnell at the free-throw line , " Prather said . " Donnell got down in a triple-threat position and took a jab step . Lewis froze and then Donnell took one dribble and leaped over him for a big dunk . He threw Lewis back into the basket because he 's so much stronger . He 's stronger than most big men . " <p> In May of this year , Harvey helped the Celtics win Gibbons ' Tournament of Champions , averaging 12.4 points and 12 rebounds in the event . He returned to New Jersey for the ABCD camp in June as one of the tournament 's premier players , averaging more than 15 points and 10 rebounds in all-star games . <p> Surprisingly , Harvey was snubbed for most valuable player honors at ABCD , which went to Leon Smith of Chicago , a top-25 recruit nationally , who reportedly might enter the NBA draft . <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Harvey said . " I try not to worry about it too much . " <p> But Smith paid for the oversight a few days later at the Vegas Big-Time tournament . The players met in the playoffs of the 224-team tournament , and Harvey completely shut down Smith , finishing with nine blocked shots in the game . <p> " He absolutely blocked everything Leon had to offer , " Gibbons said . " The story in Las Vegas was that Harvey kicked his butt . Smith was yelling over to his coach to take him out of the game . " <p> Now , Harvey faces perhaps his biggest challenge over the next six months . He says he needs to raise his SAT score by nearly 100 points . He 's taking two classes twice weekly at Darson Private School in Albany , in addition to a full workload at Randolph-Clay , to raise his grade-point average . Harvey expects to receive his latest ACT score this week . <p> " It 's going well , " Harvey said . " I think I 'll qualify . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs to improve his shooting range and free-throw shooting . Although he 's an exceptional rebounder , runs the floor well and has the ability to put the ball on the floor , his offensive game is limited . <p> " Some people have him rated the top player in the country , " Gibbons said . " But I think the one void in his game is that he does n't have outside-scoring ability . He 's limited in his shooting range . If he 's going to be a Dennis Rodman , he has to improve his offensive skills .
