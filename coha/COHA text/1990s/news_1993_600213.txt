<p> LILLEHAMMER , Norway The Winter Olympics are coming to this quiet little town in ' 94 , and if Torstein Rudi has anything to say about it , they 'd better behave themselves . <p> Ecological messes will not be looked on with kindness . Nor will any waste of electricity or needless cutting of trees . If you make trash , you 'd better take it with you when you go . <p> The same rules apply for the thousands of international travelers expected to descend upon this pristine wilderness to get a preview of what they 'll be seeing on TV screens during worldwide Olympic telecasts in February 1994 . <p> This is the land that gave birth to the fabled trolls . And a land where the mountains , forests and lakes are pretty much as they were generations ago . <p> " We have a very close relationship to nature , " says Rudi , who works for the Lillehammer Olympic Organizing Committee and has lived in this town of 22,945 all his life , as have his parents . <p> " Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to its original state , you do n't want to damage it . " <p> To that end , great planning and care have gone into building the Olympic venues . Contractors face an $ 8,000 fine if they cut trees unnecessarily . Ingenious , energy-efficient heating systems are being built into the speed skating , ice hockey and figure skating halls . The bobsled track is carved into a mountainside site so that it 's nearly invisible to viewers just a short distance away . <p> " The construction of all these installations has changed the look of the town , naturally , " says Kari Sand Nikolaisen , headmistress of the Nybu Upper Secondary School here and a town resident for 18 years . But " the environment has been heavily focused upon in the planning , pre-construction period , and because of the care taken , I do not feel that the present installations have done any harm to the town and its surroundings . " <p> One hopes not . The town of Lillehammer is picture-book pretty . About 105 miles from the capital city of Oslo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' colony . Painters have been drawn to the area because of its unusual quality of light , which at certain times gives a pink or blue cast to the snow . <p> To display the work of these and other Norwegian artists , a small gallery has been enlarged and converted into a bright and airy showplace expected to attract Olympic visitors . <p> Lillehammer streets are lined with shops and homes built of wood in a traditional architectural style adapted from the Swiss . Local people drive , but the most popular method of transport in winter for young and old alike is the kick-sled , a cleverly designed scooter-like sled with a seat in front for a small child or a bag of groceries . <p> Busy shops along the town 's pedestrian main street offer an irresistible assortment of Norweigan ski sweaters in traditional designs ( $ 80-$ 150 ) , along with stone-and-silver jewelry , hand-blown glass typical of the region , and a delicious butter cookie that is a Norwegian version of the Italian pizzelle . <p> There 's also already a dazzling and somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 ) to jackets ( $ 250 ) . <p> Surrounding hills are criss-crossed with ski trails and footpaths , a testament to the Norwegians ' firm belief in the benefits of fresh air and exercise . <p> On warm spring and summer days , the hills are truly alive with the sounds of hikers and nature lovers . Even during the coldest and dreariest of winter days , when temperatures hover around 0 degrees Fahrenheit , Lillehammer moms are out in droves , pushing baby carriages whose passengers peer out from down-filled buntings , their pink cheeks cheering up the landscape . <p> Norwegian kids grow up outside , says Miriam Henriksen , another Olympic committee staffer . <p> " Every weekend , every family goes for a walk in the woods or the park , " she says , confessing that now , as an adult , she " feels guilty " if she stays in her apartment on a weekend . " The children are outside all day . " <p> It 's in part because of the children that some Lillehammer citizens view the Olympic festivities with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Games , I feel that we have gained a lot , " says Nikolaisen , pointing to a recent restoration of a lovely old bank building , now a cultural center ; the new art museum ; and the sports facilities . <p> But , she says , " I am concerned about the post-Olympic period and the use of all these installations . It 's important that the work being done now can contribute to great activity after February 1994 . The installations . . . must be used . " <p> They probably will . Planners are building state-of-the-art sports facilities with an eye on the future , hoping to attract international competition and visitors for years to come . <p> If you go ...
