<p> CHICAGO Scottie Pippen could hardly believe it when told he played in 128 basketball games last season . <p> " Wow , " he said , with a stunned look on his face . " That 's a lot of games . " <p> Indeed it is . <p> The average National Basketball Association player plays 87 games a season and the average collegian 33 games . But last season was special . It was the first time NBA players were permitted to play in the Olympics , so it made for a long , long , long season for the Dream Teamers . <p> Pippen 's total of 128 games included : nine preseason , 82 regular season , the All-Star Game , 22 playoff , six Tournament of the Americas and eight in the Olympics . <p> That long road has taken a toll , however , with many of the NBA players who were on the Olympic team suffering some sort of physical problem this season . <p> Of the nine NBA veterans on the team , five Pippen , Michael Jordan of Chicago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Portland and Chris Mullin of Golden State have already missed more games this season than all of last season . <p> Also , among the nine ( Christian Laettner is a rookie and Larry Bird and Magic Johnson have retired ) , all except Utah 's Karl Malone has seen his shooting percentage drop from last season . A decline in shooting percentage is one statistic that can be related to fatigue because leg strength just is n't there . <p> Everyone who was asked to play knew he would be giving up most of his offseason , but all jumped at the chance , and most , despite being fatigued both mentally and physically this season , say they have no regrets . <p> " We were a part of history , " says Charles Barkley . " The Dream Team was the greatest team ever assembled and it was certainly worth giving up a little free time in the offseason to be a part of it . " <p> For Jordan , the season has been very trying . <p> ' Mentally and physically , playing so many games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missed four games this season , two because of a painful foot infection that hospitalized him three days . " I hit the wall mentally and phsyically earlier in the season but I 've gotten over it , " he says . " I just did n't get the amount of rest I normally get in the offseason . <p> Jordan was suspended for one game for fighting with Indiana 's Reggie Miller and missed another game with a sprained ankle . <p> He says the injuries are n't related to having played so many games last season . <p> Most NBA players take a month or two off after the season , but playing in the Olympics added about 50 days of practices and games to their season . The games were all easy victories , but the mental pressure of being expected to win big every game was always present . <p> Stockton , who broke a bone in his leg in the Tournament of the Americas , was the only player to sustain a major injury after the Dream Team got together . But Drexler aggravated a knee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has since been sidelined with a strained hamstring . <p> " It would have obviously been better for me if I could have rested my knee for a couple of months , " Drexler says , " but the chance to play in the Olympics was such an honor I could n't pass it up . " <p> Charles Grantham , head of the NBA Players Association , says players definitely need a break between seasons and there is a maximum number of games a player should play in a season . But that number is uncertain . It all depends on the individual . What the long-term effects of playing so many games in a season is also uncertain . <p> " What we do n't do in this sport is take a scientific approach to looking at the effect all of this basketball has on the body , " Grantham says . " We knew playing so many games in a season could have been a problem , and I thought the players and coaches handled it very well . There was a good balance between work and relaxation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a control group now because we have a group of players who have gone through this , " he says . " We should plug into the Olympic training center in Colorado and look at things like emotional stress , peaking and things that they do with other sports . I do n't think we 've paid enough atttention to this . It should concern us . " <p> Says Pippen : " I was concerned earlier about the fatigue and playing so much , but not anymore . You ca n't think about it . " <p> San Antonio 's David Robinson missed the last part of last season and the playoffs because of thumb surgery . He says playing in the Olympics was good for him because he had rested while everyone else was playing . <p> " The rest you get in the offseason is important , though , " he says , " because it allows the bumps and bruises and little sprains you got from the season a chance to heal . " <p> What playing in the Olympics did was basically deprive the players of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unwind and get mentally prepared for the upcoming season . <p> " You need an offseason , " says John Lally , trainer of the Washington Bullets and chairman of the National Basketball Trainers Association . " It takes a normal person a month just to wind down from a season . Each guy has to find a way to relax . <p> " Some guys can just play a lot of games and be fine and some ca n't . The guys we had on the Olympic team are all exceptional athletes . " <p> Rod Thorn , the NBA 's vice president of operations and a member of the Dream Team selection committee , says the Olympic commitment was only 14 games , or the equivalent of two seven-game playoff series spread over 45 days . <p> " The games were n't very hard and everybody felt it was great for the NBA to participate . No players turned us down and I think the experience was well worth it for everyone . " <p> Fatigue and injuries have set in for Dream Teamers Michael Jordan , Scottie Pippen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is usually where fatigue shows most in NBA players . Of the nine active NBA players who played in the NBA last season and in the Olympics , eight of them have fallen off in field goal percentage . Only Karl Malone has improved .
