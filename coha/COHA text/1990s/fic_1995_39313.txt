SOMETIMES I LIE AWAKE , ALONE . <p> He-e-e-e-ey ! is a silent sound . It soars , grows , multiplies under the dome of night . It rolls and thins out . It melts . It is my vain , unquenchable call . <p> I have a memory from my youth . We disappeared from the graduation ball . He rolled out his motorcycle , and I climbed into the sidecar in my white dress . We rode for a long time to put a sure distance between us and the village , the people , the lights , all sound . Neither of us said a word once we left the celebration to vanish into the night . Language was turned off ; it had no application here . <p> We rode and I shivered , sensing that I lacked the requisite courage . Then we stopped . It became quiet . <p> All the silence , as much as there is of it , gathered here . We sat unable to move a finger , pressed down by the silence , lowered along with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Only the space claimed by the light  --  a tiny piece carved out of the huge darkness  --  was ours . We folded into ourselves like snails and hid , holding our eyes in the safety of the light , afraid to turn them outward into the darkness . <p> I knew I would have to be the one to break the silence . I would have to get up out of the sidecar , step out into the night , into the steppes . He had no right , he did n't dare prompt me . I had to do it of my own free will . <p> I stalled , scared . <p> He did n't turn off the headlight , and I knew why : to keep a separation between light and dark . He was letting me hide in the darkness . The darkness would help , but everything else was up to me  --  that was the just and honest way to do it . <p> But I did n't have it in me . I grew into the sidecar ; he remained in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to get up to be together . There comes a point when love demands a scary , sacred sacrifice . Remember the Nogei bird carrying Ivan across the precipice in the fairy tale , turning its head from time to time to get sustenance : a piece of meat , a drink of water ? Then the meat in Ivan 's bucket is exhausted , but the bird turns its head , opening its beak insistently : Take your knife out , Ivan , and cut a piece from your body  --  or you wo n't make it across the precipice . <p> Does n't leave much room for pleasure . <p> I sat there , small and contemptible , holding on to the sidecar for dear life . <p> He understood . He sighed and turned the ignition key . We returned into the world , the undemanding world of the comfortingly familiar : the noise of the motor , the wind , the lights in people 's houses . <p> The next day we left for different places . We never saw each other again . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was no trace of him . By the time I had the money and freedom to go in search of him , so many years had passed , transforming my face , that I no longer dared appear before my beloved : it would insult his memory of me . Also , he probably had a family , a happy family ( nothing but happiness could possibly have been awaiting the family of my beloved ) . <p> Happiness was something I did n't know how to do . <p> One person in a couple has to know the recipe . Then the other one can learn . Neither my husband nor I knew the recipe . <p> We have this Uncle Kolia Butko , who has worked out a theory of gravity ( the existing one was n't good enough ) . According to his , bodies do n't attract but push one another away because each one emanates a force , crowding the other bodies . The other ones , then , resist . The Earth has its own resistance to the pressure of the sun and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between these two battling forces . Though this is n't true everywhere . The Earth has a weak spot in the Bermuda Triangle , in his opinion , and that creates a kind of trapdoor there . In the Apennines , on the other hand , there are some heavy-ore deposits that have a great deal of resistance and simply force things up out of that place . And the weight of objects on the Earth 's surface should change with the time of day : during the day , when the sun 's pressure is stronger , things weigh more . ( " Uncle Kolia , have you checked this thing out ? " " Nah , have n't gotten around to it yet . " ) <p> The thing I find most appealing about Uncle Kolia Butko 's theory is the idea that bodies take into consideration each other 's forces and use something akin to diplomacy to find mutually tolerable positions , setting what Uncle Kolia calls " the square of distance " between them . It is this " square of distance " that I hold dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The optimal square of distance is a point of balance of different forces , where they do each other the least harm . I did n't set it with my God-given husband . But now he is dead . <p> Uncle Kolia explains the chaos of Brownian motion by the fact that such a large number of particles ca n't find a " square " that would be tolerable to all . So they are forever pushing one another around . <p> That 's what I see when I look at people : Brownian motion . <p> Uncle Kolia 's theory has many other benefits : he can use it to explain high and low tide or substantiate the existence of Jupiter 's rings , and he is willing to throw in a perpetual motion machine for good measure  --  a wheel that uses its own weight to keep rolling . True , his prototype can only go downhill , but he says this is just a flaw in the handmade model , and he has n't been able to get factory equipment for his wheel because he 's been slighted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeps hoping that physicists will be brought to the collective farm for the harvest so that he can corner them and make them explain how it is they figure seasons work . But we keep not getting any physicists for the harvest because they keep sending humanities types like you . Of course he could go see some physicists himself , but Uncle Kolia just does n't have the time . I did n't even go to search for my beloved , which was the question of my whole life  --  surely he can live with some questions in his mind . <p> If I 'd gone , if I 'd scraped up the determination to drop everything and go on a wild-goose chase , I would have become stronger precisely by the measure of this act ( and any subsequent act , if any followed ) , the way muscles get stronger from exercise . <p> Or I could begin even earlier : if I had gotten out of the sidecar .... <p> No , even earlier , sometime in my childhood when I stood still instead of yelling " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and overcoming obstacles .... <p> Maybe all our troubles start in childhood . Take my late husband , for example . When he was born  --  a boy , a joy  --  they named him Roman and expected only the best for him . But that 's not the way it happened . His father was arrested , as a lot of people were then . His mother , left without her " square , " tried to keep her equilibrium for a while , and then lost it . She started getting sucked into the weak spot in the Earth 's resistance . No , not in the way you are primed to understand it . Good things happen to people in many different ways , and so do bad things . Her life became dependent on her breakdowns the way electrical power lines are dependent on their posts . A sort of reverse gravity . Her breakdowns sustained her spiritually , and she preferred them to all other kinds of sustenance . Little Roman was her most available victim , and she haunted him like a predator : one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She would raise her voice to the highest level , right up to the ceiling where it no longer fit ( and flattened out into nothing ) , and curse him this way and that , all on one note , grateful to be liberated , freed from some intolerable internal pressure . Then she would enter another boring stretch of electrical power lines , an expanse of sagging cables , a state that lasted until her next opportunity to express herself . <p> Little Roman knew already that this was " bad . " He was three , and he looked at his mother , paralyzed , and the key to all his future life was growing firmly into his spine : the knowledge that " bad " was allowed . Moreover , that overcoming the prohibition of " bad " can bring unbelievable joy , which can not be had any other way . It 's like nuclear energy : you 've got an ordinary substance , not fuel  --  but there is an awful force concealed in its atoms , and if it 's let out then no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was like that with my mother-in-law , may she rest in peace . She had no talents , no skills , no special brain power  --  no spark and no fire . But she extracted the forbidden force of the conquered " bad " from the gray dust that made up her self , and out of it grew the disgraceful mushroom cloud under which my husband grew up . My late husband . After that he was n't happy with anything his whole life . He could n't be satisfied . And I did n't know how to save him . Falling was the only thing that tasted sweet to him . But in order to fall , you need to start up high . He never had any height to begin with . All he could do was spread himself out over a flat place . So I sent my daughter to my mother 's to grow up . By the end he was half insane , and I was afraid of him . He needed to kill me . There was nothing else that could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't toss him petty fights like you 'd toss logs into an oven . He was freezing . He got the psychic chills , see ? I would wake up in the middle of the night and see him lying awake on his bed , his chin resting on his hand , looking at me so heavy , sullen , like stone . His other hand would be hanging down to the floor . It was this monolithic stare that woke me up . <p> But he did n't have the strength to kill me . All he could do was dream . He liked telling me about all sorts of crimes that supposedly happened somewhere in our area . Then it would turn out that he 'd made up half of them himself and exaggerated the other half . He lived these fantasies . Vodka did n't do anything for him anymore . He would drink and drink without finding the edge he could come up against and hold on to . He was in free fall , and there was n't a single thing for him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though the horror was dulled from our whole life without a " square of distance . " I 'd been sick myself for a long time . There was no way I could not have been : I saw the psychiatrist on TV say that the necessary conditions for health are a job that you like , good friends , and a happy family life . I wanted him to die myself ; I 'd wanted it for many years . I wanted him to be killed . I 'm scaring you , are n't I ? I lived my fantasies , too . I think I fantasized about this for such a long time and so hard that my thoughts finally congealed into a dense lump , so dense that it materialized . That 's how you make butter , you know : you keep churning and churning , and then finally it hardens . My thoughts congealed into a dense lump and passed from the world of ideas into the material world . On the thirtieth day of a drinking binge , he hanged himself . I woke up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll skip the details . You have no use for them . <p> But I wo n't lie to you : after some time , when the dust settled , I became happy . I breathed easier . <p> And stupid me , I did n't try to hide it . I told lots of people everywhere : I I feel so good ! ( If I could remember now everyone I told and take my careless cries of joy back from them ! ) I did n't know then how dangerous this was . <p> He started coming to me in my dreams . I would see him standing in a crowd , pretending that he could n't see me but really thinking up something to do to me . And if I turned away , he would attack . I would be shaking , and I 'd wake up so I could hide from him in this world . I would walk around in a disgusted sort of fear for days on end and say bad things about him to anyone and everyone I happened to talk to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . No ! But we 've ignored so many commandments with no harm to ourselves  --  how was I supposed to know that this one was so strong ? <p> You smile ... I understand .... We 're all educated , but we 've all got some part of this education we forget . Because life is stronger anyway . Obviously , it 's silly to believe in dreams . Uncle Kolia Butko laughed , too . I see , I see : his self-rolling wheel and squares of distance are n't funny , because they are from the material phenomena department , but as for dreams , those are just ignorant superstitions . <p> But there is another person who came to me in my dreams : the beloved of my youth . My love for him , it had its head cut off so suddenly  --  it 's like if you cut off a rooster 's head , the bird will still run around for a bit and then fall down on the ground , headless , and keep fluttering for a long time . <p> Sometimes I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a collective farm meeting , and it was night , and I was wandering down an empty corridor . I looked into some room and saw  --  stupefying joy !  --  he was waiting for me , my beloved . But then people showed up , and they had my damned late husband with them , and I was embarrassed to tell them to go away because of my spousal duty . And people kept talking , and my beloved awaited my decision , and the less it looked like we would be together , the paler he got , the more apathetic , like he was withering , disappearing , until  --  look !  --  the room was empty . And this is one thing I ca n't forgive my damned enemy for . <p> Or I 'd dream that I was on my way into town , and the bus was full of people from our village , and suddenly I saw that there was a tent on the bank of the collective farm pond , and he , my beloved , was standing by the tent . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear that he was here because of me . But I was embarrassed to tell the bus driver to stop , so I betrayed him again , and again his image paled , faded , and disappeared . And I stayed on the bus , but I sensed there was a deadly danger behind my back . I turned around and  --  oh , my God !  --  my damned husband was sitting right behind me , staring at me with his mean eyes , and close by was his mother with the same sort of mean face on . I was trapped . I wanted to run down the aisle , but there were people all around and I felt self-conscious . So I sat there , keeping up appearances , anticipating the knife in my back . <p> And again I would tell one and all : Thank God he is dead , the bastard , he just about stabbed me in my sleep last night . <p> And then I realized that because of the things I said he would come back even meaner and more dangerous in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And so our mutual hatred kept growing . Yes , I mean mutual : it 's as if his dreary spirit was hanging around here and knew about all my hatred and was getting its revenge . ( I do n't know if he can  --  if we are not only what you can touch , if we are some kind of intricate nerve that 's invisibly grown into another world and is sucking juice out of it like a tree sucks out of the ground with its roots , like an umbilical cord that someone can step on and break in the other dimension somewhere ... ) <p> There is this superstition that if you are being haunted by a dead man , you should go to church and give money to poor people . But I could n't let myself follow some superstition ; I was embarrassed the same way I was embarrassed and scared to get out of the motorcycle sidecar , the same way I was embarrassed to stop the bus and run to my beloved in plain view of everybody , the same way I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go someplace else . I spent my whole life in captivity of one sort or another . I was n't the master of my fate ; rather , my fate pushed me aside so I would n't be underfoot . Does n't it sound as if I spent my whole life following a set of superstitions we call " propriety " ? Everyone chooses their own superstitions to follow . And I could n't find any excuse for going into town to give out money in front of the church . I would rather have let myself die than break the habits of my consciousness . <p> And I was dying , because I was weak , unable to act . My beloved was right not to have come looking for me . I am nothing , and he realized it all the way back then , in the steppes . <p> I was dying , yes . I had marked two years of living without my oppressor . I should have been happy , but every day my body was getting heavier and heavier , and I was more and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youth had felt like  --  when you walk without feeling your feet , a little like running and a little like flying . Where did that kind of lightness come from ? Your soul was ahead of you , and you were following it . Your soul was in a hurry . <p> But I got so much heavier , though I had n't gained any weight . Nothing excited my spirit anymore ; the only things moving inside me were percolating concerns about food , repairs , income  --  and even if I never ran and just walked , I would get so tired of dragging myself around that by the end of the day I could barely move my feet . I would fall down at night and go to sleep . But I never felt rested . If I could have , I would have slept and slept during the day , too . <p> And so it went . I had a stomach ulcer . I had an operation . I had varicose veins . I had one breakdown after another . It happens like that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been working fine , and then one thing breaks and you fix it , but in the process you invariably disturb something in another place , and it just keeps going . <p> I could n't run anymore , and I did n't want to either . <p> Then you know what I figured out ? It was his evil spirit over me . He was the one stepping on my umbilical cord , on my intricate root in the sky . So I stopped getting my sustenance , the stuff that kept me alive . <p> Spiteful bastard could n't be satisfied with the fact that I could n't be with my beloved . <p> I admit , of course , that I 'm weak myself . I said that already . There are people who seem to have such thick umbilical cords to the sources of their strength that no one can stop the flow . They could live in the desert and still have full lives . As for me , I have hardening of the arteries of the spirit  --  that 's my ailment . Go ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my foe . It was our notorious , lazy maybe : " Maybe it will be better tomorrow  --  and come to think of it , Friday was n't half bad . " <p> I was afraid of change . So I did n't go anywhere . Plus , I do n't like your town , I hope you do n't mind my saying . Which brings me back to Uncle Kolia 's immortal " square of distance . " Like the Earth-the way it has its atmospheric coating  --  every person carries with them their own force , which should n't be crowded : it needs space like we have in the village  --  you walk around and your " square of distance " makes itself comfortable . In the city you ca n't take this " square " into consideration because there is no room for it . If you are walking down the street , it 's crowded ; if you squeeze onto a tram , your poor " square " will get dented and damaged  --  which is how people get heart attacks . When I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those squashed " squares " squeaking . <p> Here it 's quiet . <p> So I lived with my foe . <p> If you want to know something interesting  --  Uncle Kolia Butko does n't get sick . He has this furious spirit boiling inside him  --  the theory stuff  --  and he gives it all his attention , forgetting about himself . Try asking him , " Uncle Kolia , how 's your health ? " and he gets insulted . " Sickness is dumb , " he answers . And you know something  --  his step is light . <p> One day I happened to look at a childhood picture of myself . I saw eyes dense as oil spilling out over the edge . And now what have I got Eyes get shallower with time , like rivers . That 's my own brand of ecology . <p> So . This is what happened to me then . I was on a bus , and it was dark , so you could n't really tell people 's ages too well . If you could see their eyes shining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bus traveling at night in a strange place , between cities . A young man got on and sat down next to me . He had no luggage , just his working papers , which he took out once he sat down , read the notation about having voluntarily resigned , stuck them back in his pocket , and looked around with the victorious expression of a person who has acted with determination . And I saw that he was going to run out of room on his working papers very quickly , so much potential determination was in that face . Then I discovered that my seat did n't recline . He suggested that we trade seats , but I would n't accept his offer . Then he generously got up and went somewhere into the back of the bus , leaving me his seat . to use for free , without having to be in his debt . That was the kind of sensitive person he was . When the bus stopped , he went out to smoke a cigarette , and when he got back on , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my heart . And again the bus rode for a long time through the night , passing the lights of lonely snowed-over villages at long intervals . <p> The motor droned on monotonously , and all the passengers slept  --  except for two guys sitting behind me , who 'd just been released from prison and could n't get enough of talking softly  --  about freedom , about transport , about canned fish in tomato paste , about timber cutting and the temper of their equipment . Near as I could gather , one of them fixed a tractor that had been written off , but then the tractor died anyway . He spoke with pain of how much he had loved this tractor , because he could n't stop being human just because he was behind bars , so he had to have something to love . I was half asleep . Then I saw my young man walk through the darkened bus up to the driver , blocking my view of the road ; the driver slowed down , turned on a dim inside light , stopped , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desert by a turnoff with a sign pointing toward an invisible village . Passing by my window , the young man raised his head and sent the long ray of his farewell stare straight at me , putting quite a bit of his heart into it . <p> The bus started moving again , the light went out , everyone kept sleeping in the dark , but I was really agitated . You see , this look of his  --  he took it out of himself and sent it off into the silent darkness , with no hope of a response . You understand ? It 's like using all the energy from a power plant to create a radio signal and then sending it off into the cold cosmos without a response . It was free , you see . Yes , maybe he felt sad for my youth  --  gone , lost to him . Maybe he was using me to send love to this inaccessible youth of mine like food to the hungry , this generous man . He shared pure warmth with me . It was like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flame and passed it from one person to another . And it gave me something I had n't had : warmth , excitement . I got my spirit back . <p> I understood then how people live their love . <p> And you know what happened then ? I suddenly realized that my late husband had left me alone  --  and I had forgotten and forgiven all the grief he had caused me . <p> Was one look from a young stranger enough to chase away the man who was haunting me ? Is that what happened ? <p> Then my ailments disappeared . I mean , I thought of them one day , and it was like they 'd never been here . You do n't have to believe me if you do n't want to . I am alive ; the world is full of anxiety ; and I hear an eternal wind inside of me , you understand ? And my step is light . <p> And that young stranger does n't even know what he did for me . <p> But now I know what to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gather all my love into one bunch , I gather up all its unused force , and I send this ray toward the point at which my memory is aimed : to the beloved of my youth . <p> He-e-e-ey ! <p> This is not a call anymore ; it is the opposite of a call . <p> And somewhere , I do n't know where  --  does n't even matter  --  he will wake up in the morning , fill of joy and strength . <p> Excerpted from Half a Revolution : Contemporary Fiction by Russian Women , edited and translated by Masha Gessen .
