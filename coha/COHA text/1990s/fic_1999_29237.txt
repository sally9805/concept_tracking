Benton Wesley was taking off his running shoes in my kitchen when I ran to him , my heart tripping over fear and hate and remembered horror . Carrie Grethen 's letter had been mixed in a stack of mail and other paperwork , all of it put off until a moment ago when I had decided to drink cinnamon tea in the privacy of my Richmond , Virginia , home . It was Sunday afternoon , thirty-two minutes past five , June eighth . " I 'm assuming she sent this to your office , " Benton said . He did not seem disturbed as he bent over , peeling off white Nike socks . " Rose does n't read mail marked personal and confidential . " I added a detail he already knew as my pulse ran hard . " Maybe she should . You seem to have a lot of fans out there . " His wry words cut like paper . I watched him set pale bare feet on the floor , his elbows on his knees and head low . Sweat trickled over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and my eyes drifted down knees and calves , to tapered ankles still imprinted with the weave of his socks . He ran his fingers though wet silver hair and leaned back in the chair . " Christ , " he muttered , wiping his face and neck with a towel . " I 'm too old for this crap . " He took a deep breath and blew out slowly with mounting anger . The stainless steel Breitling Aerospace watch I had given to him for Christmas was on the table . He picked it up and snapped it on . " Goddamn it . These people are worse than cancer . Let me see it , " he said . The letter was penned by hand in bizarre red block printing , and drawn at the top was a crude crest of a bird with long tail feathers . Scrawled under it was the enigmatic Latin word ergo , or therefore , which in this context meant nothing to me . I unfolded the simple sheet of white typing paper by its corners and set it in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He did not touch a document that might be evidence as he carefully scanned Carrie Grethen 's weird words and began running them through the violent database in his mind . " The postmark 's New York , and of course there 's been publicity in New York about her trial , " I said as I continued to rationalize and deny . " A sensational article just two weeks ago . So anyone could have gotten Carrie Grethen 's name from that . Not to mention , my office address is public information . This letter 's probably not from her at all . Probably some other cuckoo . " " It probably is from her . " He continued reading . " She could mail something like this from a forensic psychiatric hospital and nobody would check it ? " I countered as fear coiled around my heart . " Saint Elizabeth 's , Bellevue , Mid-Hudson , Kirby . " He did not glance up . " The Carrie Grethens , the John Hinckley Juniors , the Mark David Chapmans are patients , not inmates . They enjoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and forensic psychiatric centers and create pedophile bulletin boards on computers and sell serial killer tips through the mail . And write taunting letters to chief medical examiners . " His voice had more bite , his words more clipped . Benton 's eyes burned with hate as he finally lifted them to me . " Carrie Grethen is mocking you , big chief . The FBI . Me , " he went on . " FIB , " I muttered , and on another occasion , I might have found this funny . Wesley stood and draped the towel over a shoulder . " Let 's say it 's her , " I started in again . " It is . " He had no doubt . " Okay . Then there 's more to this than mockery , Benton . " " Of course . She 's making sure we do n't forget that she and Lucy were lovers , something the general public does n't know yet , " he said . " The obvious point is , Carrie Grethen has n't finished ruining people 's lives . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it enraged me that she was now , this moment , inside my West End home . She might as well be sitting at my breakfast table with us , curdling the air with her foul , evil presence . I envisioned her condescending smile and blazing eyes and wondered what she looked like now after five years of steel bars and socializing with the criminally insane . Carrie was not crazy . She had never been that . She was a character disorder , a psychopath , a violent entity with no conscience . I looked out at wind rocking Japanese maples in my yard and the incomplete stone wall that scarcely kept me from my neighbors . The telephone abruptly rang and I was reluctant to answer it . " Dr. Scarpetta , " I said into the receiver as I watched Benton 's eyes sweep back down that red-penned page . " Yo , " Peter Marino 's familiar voice came over the line . " It 's me . " He was a captain with the Richmond Police Department , and I knew him well enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad news . " What 's up ? " I said to him . " A horse farm went up in flames last night in Warrenton . You may have heard about it on the news , " he said . " Stables , close to twenty high-dollar horses , and the house . The whole nine yards . Everything burned to the ground . " So far , this was n't making any sense . " Marino , why are you calling me about a fire ? In the first place , Northern Virginia is not your turf . " " It is now , " he said . My kitchen seemed to get small and airless as I waited for the rest . " ATF 's just called out NRT , " he went on . " Meaning us , " I said . " Bingo . Your ass and mine . First thing in the morning . " The Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms ' National Response Team , or NRT , was deployed when churches or businesses burned , and in bombings or any other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not ATF , but it was not unusual for it and other law enforcement agencies to recruit us when the need arose . In recent years I had worked the World Trade Center and Oklahoma City bombings and the crash of TWA Flight 800 . I had helped with the identifications of the Branch Davidians at Waco and reviewed the disfigurement and death caused by the Una-bomber . I knew from stressful experience that ATF included me in a call-out only when people were dead , and if Marino was recruited , too , then the suspicion was murder . " How many ? " I reached for my clipboard of call sheets . " It 's not how many , Doc . It 's who . The owner of the farm is media big shot Kenneth Sparkes , the one and only . And right now it 's looking like he did n't make it . " " Oh God , " I muttered as my world suddenly got too dark to see . " We 're sure ? " " Well , he 's missing . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being told about this ? " I felt anger rising , and it was all I could do not to hurl it at him , for all unnatural deaths in Virginia were my responsibility . I should n't have needed Marino to inform me about this one , and I was furious with my Northern Virginia office for not calling me at home . " Do n't go getting pissed at your docs up in Fairfax , " said Marino , who seemed to read my mind . " Fauquier County asked ATF to take over here , so that 's the way it 's going . " I still did n't like it , but it was time to get on with the business at hand . " I 'm assuming no body has been recovered yet , " I said , and I was writing fast . " Hell no . That 's going to be your fun job . " I paused , resting the pen on the call sheet . " Marino , this is a single-dwelling fire . Even if arson is suspected , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ATF is interested . " " Whiskey , machine guns , not to mention buying and selling fancy horses , so now we 're talking about a business , " Marino answered . " Great , " I muttered . " Oh yeah . We 're talking a goddamn nightmare . The fire marshal 's gon na call you before the day 's out . Better get packed because the whirlybird 's picking us up before dawn . Timing 's bad , just like it always is . I guess you can kiss your vacation goodbye . " Benton and I were supposed to drive to Hilton Head tonight to spend a week at the ocean . We had not had time alone so far this year and were burned out and barely getting along . I did not want to face him when I hung up the phone . " I 'm sorry , " I said to him . " I 'm sure you 've already figured out there 's a major disaster . " I hesitated , watching him , and he would not give me his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've got to go . First thing in the morning . Maybe I can join you in the middle of the week , " I went on . He was not listening because he did not want to hear any of it . " Please understand , " I said to him . He did not seem to hear me , and I knew he was terribly disappointed . " You 've been working those torso cases , " he said as he read . " The dismemberments from Ireland and here . Sawed-up bone . ' And she fantasizes about Lucy , and masturbates . Reaching orgasm multiple times a night under the covers . Allegedly . " His eyes ran down the letter as he seemed to talk to himself . " She 's saying they still have a relationship , Carrie and Lucy , " he continued . " The we stuff is her attempt to make a case for disassociation . She 's not present when she commits her crimes . Some other party doing them . Multiple personalities . A predictable and pedestrian insanity plea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more original . " " She is perfectly competent to stand trial , " I answered with a wave of fresh anger . " You and I know that . " He drank from a plastic bottle of Evian . " Where did Lucy Boo come from ? " A drop of water dribbled down his chin and he wiped it with the back of his hand . I stumbled at first . " A pet name I had for her until she was in kindergarten . Then she did n't want to be called that anymore . Sometimes I still slip . " I paused again as I imagined her back then . " So I guess she told Carrie the nickname . " " Well , we know that at one time , Lucy confided in Carrie quite a lot , " Wesley stated the obvious . " Lucy 's first lover . And we all know you never forget your first , no matter how lousy it was . " " Most people do n't choose a psychopath for their first , " I said , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had . " Psychopaths are us , Kay , " he said as if I had never heard the lecture . " The attractive , intelligent person sitting next to you on a plane , standing behind you in line , meeting you backstage , hooking up with you on the Internet . Brothers , sisters , classmates , sons , daughters , lovers . Look like you and me . Lucy did n't have a chance . She was no match for Carrie Grethen . " The grass in my backyard had too much clover , but spring had been unnaturally cool and perfect for my roses . They bent and shivered in gusting air and pale petals fell to the ground . Wesley , the retired chief of the FBI 's profiling unit , went on . " Carrie wants photos of Gault . Scene photos , autopsy photos . You bring them to her , and in exchange she 'll tell you investigative details , forensic jewels you 've supposedly missed . Ones that might help the prosecution when the case goes to court next month . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it might in some way be connected with Lucy . " His reading glasses were folded by his place mat , and he thought to slip them on . " Carrie wants you to come see her . At Kirby . " His face was tight as he peered at me . " It 's her . " He pointed at the letter . " She 's surfacing . I knew she would . " He spoke from a spirit that was tired . " What 's the dark light ? " I asked , getting up because I could not sit a moment longer . " Blood . " He seemed sure . " When you stabbed Gault in the thigh , severing his femoral artery , and he bled to death . Or would have had the train not finished the job . Temple Gault . " He took his glasses off again , because he was secretly agitated . " As long as Carrie Grethen is around , so is he . The evil twins , " he added . In fact , they were not twins , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their skulls . They were prepubescently thin and androgenously dressed alike when I last saw them in New York . They had committed murder together until we had captured her in the Bowery and I had killed him in the subway tunnel . I had not intended to touch him or see him or exchange one word with him , for it was not my mission in this life to apprehend criminals and commit judicial homicide . But Gault had willed it so . He had made it happen because to die by my hand was to bond me to him forever . I could not get away from Temple Gault , though he had been dead five years . In my mind were gory pieces of him scattered along gleaming steel rails and rats moiling out of dense shadows to attack his blood . In bad dreams his eyes were ice blue with irises scattered like molecules , and I heard the thunder of trains with lights that were blinding full moons . For several years after I had killed him , I avoided autopsying the victims of train deaths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system and could assign cases to my deputy chiefs , and that was what I had done . Even now , I could not look at dissecting knives with the same clinical regard for their cold sharp steel , because he had set me up to plunge one into him , and I had . In crowds I saw dissipated men and women who were him , and at night I slept closer to my guns . " Benton , why do n't you shower and then we 'll talk more about our plans for the week , " I said , dismissing recollections I could not bear . " A few days alone to read and walk the beach would be just what you need . You know how much you love the bike trails . Maybe it would be good for you to have some space . " " Lucy needs to know . " He got up , too . " Even if Carrie 's confined at the moment , she 's going to cause more trouble that involves Lucy . That 's what Carrie 's promising in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kitchen . " How much more trouble can anybody cause ? " I called after him as tears rose in my throat . " Dragging your niece into the trial , " he stopped to say . " Publicly . Splashed across The New York Times . Out on the AP , Hard Copy , Entertainment Tonight . Around the world . FBI agent was lesbian lover of deranged serial killer .... " " Lucy 's left the FBI with all its prejudices and lies and preoccupations with how the mighty Bureau looks to the world . " Tears flooded my eyes . " There 's nothing left . Nothing further they can do to crush her soul . " " Kay , this is about far more than the FBI , " he said , and he sounded spent . " Benton , do n't start ... " I could not finish . He leaned against the doorway leading into my great room , where a fire burned , for the temperature had not gotten above sixty degrees this day . His eyes were pained . He did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not want to peer into that darker side of his soul . He did not want to conjure up the malignant acts Carrie might carry out , and of course , he worried about me , too . I would be summoned to testify in the sentencing phase of Carrie Grethen 's trial . I was Lucy 's aunt . I supposed my credibility as a witness would be impeached , my testimony and reputation ruined . " Let 's go out tonight , " Wesley said in a kinder tone . " Where would you like to go ? La Petite ? Or beer and barbecue at Benny 's ? " " I 'll thaw some soup . " I wiped my eyes as my voice faltered . " I 'm not very hungry , are you ? " " Come here , " he sweetly said to me . I melted into him and he held me to his chest . He was salty when we kissed , and I was always surprised by the supple firmness of his body . I rested my head , and the stubble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beach I knew I would not see this week . There would be no long walks on wet sand or long talks over dinners at La Polla 's and Charlie 's . " I think I should go see what she wants , " I finally said into his warm , damp neck . " Not in a million years . " " New York did Gault 's autopsy . I do n't have those photographs . " " Carrie knows damn well what medical examiner did Gault 's autopsy . " " Then why is she asking me , if she knows ? " I muttered . My eyes were closed as I leaned against him . He paused and kissed the top of my head again and stroked my hair . " You know why , " he said . " Manipulation , jerking you around . What people like her do best . She wants you to get the photos for her . So she can see Gault mangled like chopped meat , so she can fantasize and get off on that . She 's up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her in any way . " " And this GKSWF -- something or other ? Like out of a personal ? " " I do n't know . " " And the One Pheasant Place ? " " No idea . " We stayed a long time in the doorway of this house I continued to think of singularly and unequivocally as my own . Benton parked his life with me when he was not consulting in big aberrant cases in this country and others . I knew it bothered him when I consistently said I this and my that , although he knew we were not married and nothing we owned separately belonged to both of us . I had passed the midline of my life and would not legally share my earnings with anyone , including my lover and my family . Maybe I sounded selfish , and maybe I was . " What am I going to do while you 're gone tomorrow ? " Wesley got back to that subject . " Drive to Hilton Head and get groceries , " I replied . " Make sure there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual . And sunblock SPF 35 and 50 , and South Carolina pecans , tomatoes , and Vidalia onions . " Tears filled my eyes again , and I cleared my throat . " As soon as I can , I 'll get on a plane and meet you , but I do n't know where this case in Warrenton is going to go . And we 've already been over this . We 've done it before . Half the time you ca n't go , the rest of the time it 's me . " " I guess our lives suck , " he said into my ear . " Somehow we ask for it , " I replied , and most of all I felt an uncontrollable urge to sleep . " Maybe . " He bent down to my lips and slid his hands to favorite places . " Before soup , we could go to bed . " " Something very bad is going to happen during this trial , " I said , and I wanted my body to respond to him but did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York again . The Bureau , you , Lucy , at her trial . Yes , I 'm sure for the past five years she has thought of nothing else and will cause all the trouble she can . " I pulled away as Carrie 's sharp , drawn face suddenly jumped out of a dark place in my mind . I remembered her when she was strikingly pretty and smoking with Lucy on a picnic table at night near the firing ranges of the FBI Academy at Quantico . I could still hear them teasing in low playful voices and saw their erotic kisses on the mouth , deep and long , and hands tangled in hair . I remembered the strange sensation running through my blood as I silently hurried away , without them knowing what I had seen . Carrie had begun the ruination of my only niece 's life , and now the grotesque coda had come . " Benton , " I said . " I 've got to pack my gear . " " Your gear is fine . Trust me . " He hungrily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He always wanted me more when I was not in sync with him . " I ca n't reassure you now , " I whispered . " I ca n't tell you everything is going to be all right , because it wo n't be . Attorneys and the media will go after Lucy and me . They will dash us against the rocks , and Carrie may go free . There ! " I held his face in my hands . " Truth and justice . The American way , " I concluded . " Stop it . " He went still and his eyes were intense on mine . " Do n't start again , " he said . " You did n't used to be this cynical . " " I 'm not cynical , and I 'm not the one who started anything , " I answered him as my anger rose higher . " I 'm not the one who started with an eleven-year-old boy and cut off patches of his flesh and left him naked by a Dumpster with a bullet in his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And Jayne -- Gault 's own twin sister . Remember that , Benton ? Remember ? Remember Central Park on Christmas Eve . Bare footprints in snow and her frozen blood dripping from the fountain ! " " Of course I remember . I was there . I know all the same details you do . " " No , you do n't . " I was furious now and moved away from him and gathered together my clothes . " You do n't put your hands inside their ruined bodies and touch and measure their wounds , " I said . " You do n't hear them speak after they 're dead . You do n't see the faces of loved ones waiting inside my poor , plain lobby to hear heartless , unspeakable news . You do n't see what I do . Oh no , you do n't , Benton Wesley . You see clean case files and glossy photos and cold crime scenes . You spend more time with the killers than with those they ripped from life . And maybe you sleep better than I do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid to . " He walked out of my house without a word , because I had gone too far . I had been unfair and mean , and not even truthful . Wesley knew only tortured sleep . He thrashed and muttered and coldly drenched the sheets . He rarely dreamed , or at least he had learned not to remember . I set salt and pepper shakers on corners of Carrie Grethen 's letter to keep it from folding along its creases . Her mocking , unnerving words were evidence now and should not be touched or disturbed . Ninhydrin or a Luma Lite might reveal her fingerprints on the cheap white paper , or exemplars of her writing might be matched with what she had scrawled to me . Then we would prove she had penned this twisted message at the brink of her murder trial in Superior Court of New York City . The jury would see that she had not changed after five years of psychiatric treatment paid for with their taxes . She felt no remorse . She reveled in what she had done . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighborhood because I had not heard his BMW leave . I hurried along new paved streets , passing big brick and stucco homes , until I caught him beneath trees staring out at a rocky stretch of the James River . The water was frigid and the color of glass , and cirrus clouds were indistinct chalky streaks in a fading sky . " I 'll head out to South Carolina as soon as I get back to the house . I 'll get the condo ready and get your Scotch , " he said , not turning around . " And Black Bush . " " You do n't need to leave tonight , " I said , and I was afraid to move closer to him as slanted light brightened his hair and the wind stirred it . " I 've got to get up early tomorrow . You can head out when I do . " He was silent , staring up at a bald eagle that had followed me since I had left my house . Benton had put on a red windbreaker , but he looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were crossed tightly at his chest . His throat moved as he swallowed , his pain radiating from a hidden place that only I was allowed to see . At moments like this I did not know why he put up with me . " Do n't expect me to be a machine , Benton , " I quietly said for the millionth time since I had loved him . Still he did not speak , and water barely had the energy to roll toward downtown , making a dull pouring sound as it unwittingly headed closer to the violence of dams . " I take as much as I can , " I explained . " I take more than most people could . Do n't expect too much from me , Benton . " The eagle soared in circles over the tops of tall trees , and Benton seemed more resigned when he spoke at last . " And I take more than most people can , " he said . " In part , because you do . " " Yes , it works both ways . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms around the slick red nylon covering his waist . " You know damn well it does , " he said . I hugged him tight and dug my chin into his back . " One of your neighbors is watching , " he said . " I can see him through sliding glass . Did you know you have a peeper in this ritzy white-bread place ? " He placed his hands over mine , then lifted one finger at a time with nothing special in mind . " Of course , if I lived here , I would peep at you too , " he added with a smile in his tone . " You do live here . " " Naw . I just sleep here . " " Let 's talk about the morning . As usual , they 'll pick me up at the Eye Institute around five , " I told him . " So I guess if I get up by four ... " I sighed , wondering if life would always be like this . " You should stay the night . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said .
