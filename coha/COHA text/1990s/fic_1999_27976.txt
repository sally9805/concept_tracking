THE TWO TELEPHONE company vans moved along the traffic-choked boulevard beside the Imperial Palace at a snail 's pace , precisely the speed at which everyone drove . Traffic in Tokyo this June morning was heavy , as usual . Reeking exhaust fumes rose from the packed roadways into the warm , hazy air in shimmering waves . In the lead van , the driver kept his eyes strictly on the traffic . The driver was in his mid-twenties , and he looked extraordinarily fit in his telephone company one-piece jumper . He wore a blue company billed cap over short , carefully groomed hair . Concentrating fiercely on the traffic around him , he drove with both hands on the steering wheel . The passenger in the lead van was a few years older than the driver . He , too , wore a one-piece blue jumper and billed cap , both of which sported the company logo . This man examined with sharp , intelligent eyes the stone wall that surrounded the palace grounds . Between the fifteen-foot wall and the boulevard was a centuries-old moat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green tangle of trees and shrubs , seemingly impenetrable . There were actually two moats , an outer moat and an inner one , but here and there they had been permanently bridged . In many places , they had just been filled in . Here in the heart of Tokyo , the remaining hundred-foot-wide expanses of water populated with ducks and lined with people were stunning , inviting , an inducement to contemplation . The passenger of the lead van paid little attention to the open water or the crowds . He was interested in police cars and palace security vehicles , and he mentioned every one he saw to the driver . Occasionally , he checked his watch . When the two vans had completely circled the royal compound , the man in the cargo area of the lead van spoke a few words into a handheld radio , listened carefully to the reply , then nodded at the man in the passenger seat , who was looking at him . That man patted the driver on the arm twice . In a few seconds , the vans turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled in here , and the vehicles went through a narrow gate in the wall to a courtyard . A uniformed security officer in a glassed-in guardhouse watched the vehicles park . There were two armed officers by the gate and two by the door of the building . All four of them watched the passenger get out of the lead vehicle and walk over to the guardhouse . The security officer 's little window was already open , apparently for ventilation . The passenger gave a polite bow , just a head bob . " We are the telephone repairmen . They told us to come this morning . " " Identity cards , please . " The passenger passed them over . " Yes . I have you on the list . " The officer gave the cards back . " Where should we park ? " " Near the door . " He gestured vaguely . " There should be no conflicts . How long will your repairs take ? " " I do n't know . We will have to inspect the failure , ensure we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be out of the palace by four o'clock . " " And if we can not fix it by then ? " " You will have to call the Imperial Household Agency , describe the problem , and make an appointment to return . " " I understand . First , we must diagnose the problem . We have some test equipment to take inside . " The security officer nodded and gestured to the two armed policemen standing near the door . It took a bit to get the vans parked and unloaded . One of the security officers went over and spoke for a moment to the man in the guardhouse while the telephone men checked their equipment . The four men each hoisted a share . One of the security officers held the door open for them , and another followed them inside . " I will show you where the problem is , " he told the four , then took the lead . " The agency has a telephone technician on the staff . If you wish , I will have him summoned and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system . " " We may have to do that , " the man who had been the passenger in the lead van said . " We will look first . " They went up a staircase to the second floor and down a long corridor . They were inside an equipment room when the garroting wire went over the guard 's head , startling him . The wire bit deeply into his neck before he could make a sound . He was struggling against the wire when one of the men , now in front of him , seized his head and twisted it so violently that his neck snapped . The repairmen took the guard 's weight as he went limp . They placed the body in a corner of the room , out of sight of anyone who might come to the door , open it , and look in . The murder had taken no more than sixty seconds . The men picked up their equipment . Outside in the hallway , the passenger from the van ensured the door was completely shut and latched . Their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the marble corridors deeper and deeper into the huge palace . The bubbling , laughing children circled about the empress with carefree abandon . They giggled deliciously as they danced around her arm in arm on the manicured green lawn , among the shrubs and flowers growing riot in lush beds , under a bright sun shining down from a gentle blue sky , while temple bells chimed in the distance . Stately , measured , the bells proclaimed the beauty of an ordered universe . Emperor Naruhito was probably the only person to pay any attention to the chiming temple bells , which he thought the perfect musical accompaniment to the informal lawn ceremony in front of him . The children 's bright , traditional dress contrasted sharply with the deep green grass and captured the eye as they circled around the empress , who was wearing a silk ivory-colored kimono trimmed with exquisite organdy . The other adults were removed a pace or two , ceding center stage to the empress and the happy children . The photographers shooting the scene stationed themselves ever so slightly out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved , and , in the finest tradition of their profession , managed to fade into the scene almost like shadows . The natural world certainly had an innocent charm that human affairs lacked , the emperor mused bitterly . For weeks now he had been brooding upon the current political situation . The new prime minister , Atsuko Abe , seemed bent on forcing the nation onto a new course , a course that Emperor Naruhito regarded with a growing sense of horror . The Japanese political situation had been drifting to the right for years , the emperor thought as he watched the empress and the children . He reviewed the sequence yet again , trying to make sense of an avalanche of events that seemed beyond human control . Each government since the great bank collapse had lasted a short while , then was swept from office and replaced by one even more reactionary . As the emperor saw it , the problem was that politicians were not willing to tell the Japanese people the truth . Their island nation was small , overpopulated , and lacked natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was built on turning imported raw materials into manufactured products and selling them to the American market at prices American manufacturers could not compete with . Japan 's price advantage rested on low labor costs , which eventually disappeared . Sky-high real estate and hyperinflated stock values fell sickeningly as Japan 's economic edge evaporated . The government propped up the overextended banking system for a while , but finally it collapsed , nearly bankrupting the government . Then tensions in the Mideast rose to the flash point and the Arabs cut off the sale of oil to force the developed world to pressure Israel . The oil was flowing once again , but the damage was done . Japan found it could not afford Mideast oil at any price . The yen was essentially worthless , the banking system in ruins , huge industrial enterprises could n't pay their bills , and disillusioned workers had been laid off in droves . Maybe the Japanese were doomed . The emperor had moments when cold anxieties seized his heart , and he had one such now . Perhaps they were all doomed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poisonous ultranationalist like Atsuko Abe , a demagogue preaching against the evils of foreign values and foreign institutions while extolling the virtues of the ancient Japanese nation -- was this the Japanese destiny ? Was this what the nation had come to ? Ah ... Japan , ancient yet young , fertile yet pure and unspoiled , home for the select of mankind , the Japanese . If that Japan had ever existed , it was long gone , yet today Abe waved the racial memory like a flag before a dispirited , once-proud people betrayed by everything they trusted . Betrayed , Abe claimed , by Western democracy . Betrayed by bureaucrats . Betrayed by captains of industry ... betrayed by capitalism , an import from a foreign culture .... Japan , Abe thundered , had been betrayed by a people who refused to hold its values dear , the Japanese . They were guilty . And they would have to pay the price . All of this was political rhetoric . It inflamed half-wits and foreigners and gave newspapers much to editorialize about , but it was only hot air , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other , more traditional politicians , and to win votes , which it did . Only when he was firmly ensconced in the prime minister 's office , with the reins of power in his hands , did Atsuko Abe began to discuss his true agenda with his closest allies . Friends of the emperor whispered to him of Abe 's ambitions , because they were deeply troubled . Abe 's proclamations , they said , were more than rhetoric . He fully intended to make Japan a world power , to do " whatever was required . " Naruhito , always conscious of the fact that the post-World War II constitution limited the throne to strictly ceremonial duties , held his tongue . Still , the burden of history weighed oppressively upon him . A personal letter from the president of the United States shattered Naruhito 's private impasse . " I am deeply concerned , " the President said , " that the Japanese government is considering a military solution to aggravating regional and economic problems , a solution that will rupture the peace of the region and may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enormous , tragic implications for every human on this planet . As heads of state , we owe our countrymen and our fellow citizens of the planet our best efforts to ensure such an event never occurs . " There was more . Naruhito read the letter with a sense of foreboding . The president of the United States knew more about the political situation in Japan than he , the emperor , did . Obviously , the president got better information . Near the end of the letter , the president said , " We believe the Abe administration plans an invasion of Siberia to secure a permanent , stable oil supply . The recent appeals of the indigenous Siberian people for Japanese aid in their revolt against the Russians are a mere pretext orchestrated by the Abe government . I fear such an invasion might trigger a world war , the like of which this planet has never seen . A third world war , one more horrible than any conflict yet waged by man , may bring civilization to a tragic end , throwing the world into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never recover . " Here , in writing , were the words that expressed the horror the emperor felt as he observed the domestic political situation . Even though he lacked the specific information that the president of the United States had , Naruhito also felt that he was watching the world he knew slide slowly and inexorably toward a horrible doom . " I am writing you personally , " the president concluded , " to ask for your help . We owe it to mankind to preserve the rule of law for future generations . Our worldwide civilization is not perfect ; it is a work in progress , made better by every person who obeys the laws and works for his daily bread , thereby contributing to the common good . Civilization is the human heritage , the birthright of all who will come after us . " Naruhito asked the prime minister to call . Although the emperor had met Atsuko Abe on several occasions since he had become prime minister , he had never before had the opportunity to speak privately with him . Always , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This time , it was just the two of them , in the emperor 's private study . After the polite preliminaries , the emperor mentioned the letter and gave Abe a copy to read . Atsuko Abe was unsure how to proceed or just what to say . A private audience with the emperor was an extraordinary honor , one that left him somewhat at a loss for words . Yet this letter ... He knew the Americans had spies -- spies and political enemies were everywhere . " Your Highness , we are at a critical juncture in our nation 's history , " Atsuko Abe said , feeling his way . " The disruption of our oil supply was the final straw . It wrecked the economy . Japan is in ruins ; millions are out of work . We must repair the damage and ensure it never happens again . " " Is it true ? " the emperor asked , waving the letter . " Is your government planning an invasion of Siberia ? " " Your Excellency , we have received a humanitarian appeal from the native @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russian yoke . Surely you have been briefed on this development . The justice of their situation is undeniable . Their appeal is quite compelling . " " You are evasive , sir . Now is the time for speaking the blunt truth , not polite evasion . " Abe was astounded . Never had he seen the emperor like this , nor imagined he could be like this . " The time has come for Japan to assume its rightful place in the world , " the prime minister said . " Which is ? " " A superpower , " Abe said confidently . He stared boldly at the emperor , who averted his eyes from the challenge on Abe 's face . Then , ashamed , he forced himself to look the prime minister in the eye . " Is it true ? " the emperor asked obstinately . " Does Japan plan to invade Siberia ? " " Our hour has come , " Abe replied firmly . " We are a small island nation , placed by the gods beside a growing Chinese giant . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an agreement with the Russians ! They will sell us oil . " " That , Your Excellency , is precisely the problem . As long as we are buying Russian oil , we are at their mercy . Japan must have its own resources . " The son of an industrialist , Atsuko Abe had spent the first two decades of his adult life in the Japanese Self-Defense Force , the military . Although he was selected for flag rank , he left at an early age and obtained a post in the defense ministry . There Abe made friends with politicians across the spectrum , rose in influence , won promotion after promotion . Finally , he left the bureaucracy and ran for a seat in the Diet , which he won handily . He had been there for almost ten years , surfing the political riptides that surged through the capital . He was ready now , at sixty-two years of age . This was his moment . The emperor refused to look away . " Our hour ? How dare you ? This nation has never been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; we have kept faith with our ancestors . Our nation has made mistakes in the past , for which our people have paid dearly , but our honor is unstained . We need no hour of conquest , no triumph of violence , no blood on our hands . " " You are born to your position , " Abe said bitterly . " What do you know of struggle , of triumph ? " The emperor fought to maintain his composure . " Russia has nuclear weapons , which the Russians might use to defend themselves . Have you the right to risk the very life of this nation ? " " We are in a grave crisis , Your Excellency . " " Do n't patronize me , Prime Minister . " Abe bowed . When he straightened , he said , " Forgive me , Excellency . The fact you do not know is that Japan also is a nuclear power . I am convinced that Russia will not risk nuclear war to retain a wasteland that has never earned her a single yen of profit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weapons ? " he whispered . " Yes . " " How ? How were these weapons developed and manufactured ? " " With the greatest secrecy . Obviously . " The manufacture of these weapons was Abe 's greatest triumph , a program reluctantly agreed to by politicians watching their world collapse , then accomplished under a security blanket worthy of Joseph Stalin . " The government did this without the consent of the Diet ? Without the knowledge and consent of the Japanese people ? In violation of the constitution and the laws ? " Abe merely bowed his head . " What if you are wrong about Russia ? " the emperor demanded . " Answer me that . What if Russia retaliates with nuclear weapons ? " " The risk is as great for Russia as it is for Japan , and Russia has less at stake . " " They may not see the equation as you do , Prime Minister . " Abe said nothing . The emperor was too astonished to go further . The man is mad , he thought . The prime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the emperor recovered his voice sufficiently to ask , " What do you suggest I tell the president of the United States in answer to his letter ? " Abe made an irritated gesture . " Ignore it . No answer is necessary , Your Excellency . The president does not know his place . " Naruhito shook his head ponderously from side to side . " My grandfather , Hirohito , received a letter from President Roosevelt on the eve of World War Two , pleading for peace . Hirohito did not answer that letter . He refused to intervene with the government . All my life , I have wondered how history might have been different had my grandfather spoken up for what he believed . " " Emperor Hirohito believed that the government was acting in the nation 's best interests . " " Perhaps he did . I am not convinced that your government is now . " Abe shook himself . He had come too far , endured too much . He faced the emperor like a sumo wrestler . " The government must speak for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That is the law . " " Do not speak to me of law . Not after what you have told me . " Abe pounded his chest . " You reign , I rule . That is the Japanese way . " Abe took several deep breaths to compose himself . " If you will give me a copy of the letter , I will have the foreign minister prepare a reply . " The emperor did n't seem to hear . He continued , thinking aloud : " In this era of nuclear , biological , and chemical weapons , war is obsolete . It is no longer a viable political option . The nation that plunges headlong into war in the twenty-first century will , I fear , merely be committing national suicide . Death , sir , is most definitely not Japan 's destiny . Death is final and eternal , whether it comes slowly , from natural causes , or swiftly , in a spectacular blaze of glory . Life , sir , must be our business . Life is our concern . " Before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added softly , " You carry a very heavy burden , Prime Minister . You carry the hopes and dreams of every Japanese alive today and those of our honored ancestors . You literally carry Japan upon your back . " " Your Excellency , I am aware of my responsibilities , " Atsuko Abe retorted , as politely as he could . He struggled to keep a grip on his temper . " Keenly aware , " he added through clenched teeth . " In your public speeches that I have read , sir , you speak as if Japan 's destiny were as obvious as the rising sun on a clear morning , " Emperor Naruhito said without rancor . " I suggest you consult the representatives of the people in the Diet before you make any major commitments . " He could think of nothing else to say to this fool facing him .... " Follow the law , " the emperor added . That was always excellent advice , but ... " The Japanese are a great people , " the emperor told the prime minister , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them , they will have faith in you . " Abe forced his head down in a gesture of respect . The skin on his head was tan , the hair cropped short . Naruhito could stand no more of this scoundrel . He rose stiffly , bowed , and walked from the room . That had been two days ago . Naruhito had forsaken his ceremonial , almost-mystical position as head of state to speak the truth as he believed it , for the good of the nation . He had never done that before , but Abe ... advocating the unthinkable ... telling the emperor to his face what his duty was -- never in his life had Naruhito been so insulted . The memory of Abe 's words still burned deeply . He had written a letter to the president of the United States , written it by hand because he did not wish to trust a secretary . The truth was bitter : He could not affect events . The children were singing now , led by Naruhito 's wife , Masako . A flush of warmth went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beloved wife , his empress , singing softly , leading the children . Truly , he loved life . Loved his wife , his people , his nation ... this Japanese nation . His life , the nation 's life , they were all bound up together , one and inseparable . A profound sense of loss swept over him . Time is running out .... Captain Shunko Kato stood concealed by a curtain at a second-floor window in the Imperial Palace , watching the ceremony on the lawn below . Behind him stood the other three erstwhile telephone repairmen , his men , standing motionless , seemingly at perfect ease . They were n't , Kato knew . He could feel the tension , tight as a violin string . Military discipline held them motionless , silent , each man in communion only with his thoughts . The sunlight coming through the window made a lopsided rectangle on the floor . Kato looked at the sunlit floor , the great frame that held the window , the hedge , the lawn , the people , the bold , brazen sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . Ah , but to dwell on his personal fate was unworthy . Kato brushed the thought away and concentrated on the figures before him on the lawn . There was the emperor , shorter than the average Japanese male at five feet four , erect , carrying a tummy . Surrounding the group were security officers in civilian clothes -- most of these men had their backs to the ceremony . Kato retreated a few inches . He ensured he was concealed by the shadow of the drape , hidden from the observation of anyone on the lawn who might look at this window . Satisfied , he scanned the security guards quickly , taking in their state of alertness at a glance ; then he turned his attention back to the royal party . The emperor stood slightly in front of a group of officials , watching the empress and the children , seemingly caught up in the simple ritual . No doubt he was . He certainly had nothing else to worry about . The emperor , Kato was sure , was quite oblivious to the desperation that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could it be otherwise ? The emperor certainly did n't move in ordinary circles . Yet the man must read newspapers , occasionally watch television . How could he miss the corruption of the politicians , the bribes , the influence peddling , the stench of scandal after scandal ? Could he not see the misery of the common people , always loyal , always betrayed ? He never spoke out against corruption , avarice , greed . Never . And never condemning , he silently approved . Kato felt his chest swelling with indignation . Oh , that they called such a man " Son of Heaven ! " An extraordinary obscenity . The empress was saying good-bye to the children . The ceremony was ending . Kato turned , surveyed his men . Still wearing the blue jumpers and caps of the telephone company , they were as fit as professional athletes , lean , with ropy muscles and easy , fluid movements . Kato had trained them , hardened them , made them soldiers in the Bushido tradition . In truth , he was proud of them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men looked back at him with faces that were also unable to conceal their emotion . " For Japan , " he said softly , just loudly enough for them to hear . " For Japan . " Their lips moved soundlessly , for he had told them to make no sound . Still , the reply echoed in Kato 's ears . " Banzai , " he mouthed . " Banzai ! " The silent reply lashed his soul . The security guards escorted the emperor and empress toward the door of the Imperial Palace . One of them held it open for the emperor , who always preceded his wife by two paces . The security men did not enter the hallway ; they remained outside . The entire palace was inside a security zone . Inside the building , away from other eyes , the emperor paused to let Masako reach his side . She flashed him a grin , a very un-Japanese gesture , but then she had spent years in the United States attending college before their marriage . He dearly enjoyed seeing her grin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and leaned forward , so that her lips brushed his cheek . His smile broadened . Arm in arm , they walked down the hall to the end , then turned right . Four men stood silently , waiting . They blocked the hallway . The emperor stopped . One of the men moved noiselessly to position himself behind the royal couple , but the others did not give way . Nor , the emperor noted with surprise , did they bow . Not even the tiniest bob . Naruhito looked from face to face . Not one of the men broke eye contact . " Yes ? " he said finally . " Your wife may leave , Your Excellency , " said one of the men . His voice was strong , even , yet not loud . " Who are you ? " asked the emperor . " I am Captain Shunko Kato of the Japanese Self-Defense Force . " Kato bowed deeply from the waist , but none of the other men moved a muscle . " These enlisted men are under my command . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our own . " Naruhito felt his wife 's hand tighten on his arm . He looked again from face to face , waiting for them to look away as a gesture of respect . None of them did . " Why are you here ? " the emperor asked finally . He realized that time was on his side , not theirs , and he wished to draw this out as long as possible . Kato seemed to read his thoughts . " We are here for Japan , " Kato said crisply , then added , " The empress must leave now . " Naruhito could read the inevitable in their faces . Although the thought did not occur to Captain Kato , Naruhito had as much courage as any man there . He turned toward the empress . " You must go , dear wife . " She stared into his face , panic-stricken . Both her hands clutched his arm in a fierce grip . He leaned toward her and whispered , " We have no choice . Go , and know I love you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the group , looking directly into the eyes of each man . Three of them averted their gaze . Then she turned and walked back toward the lawn . From a decorative table nearby , Kato took a samurai sword , which the emperor had not previously noticed . With one swift motion , the officer withdrew the blade from the sheath . " For Japan , " he said , grasping the handle with both hands . The sword was very old , the emperor noticed . Hundreds of years old . His heart was audibly pounding in his ears . He looked again at each face . They were fanatics . Resigned , Emperor Naruhito sank to his knees . He would not let them see him afraid . Thank heavens his hands were not trembling . He closed his eyes and cleared his thoughts . Enough of these zealots . He thought of his wife and his son and daughter . The last thing he heard was the slick whisper of the blade whirring through the air . Masako walked slowly toward the door where just seconds ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step was torture , agony .... The men were assassins . Masako , in her horror , had sensed it the moment she saw them . They had no respect ; their faces registered extraordinary tension -- not like loyal subjects meeting their emperor and his wife , but like assassins . She knew her nation 's history , of course , knew how assassins had plagued rulers and politicians in times of turmoil , how they always murdered for Japan -- as if their passionate patriotism could excuse the blood , could excuse slashing the life from men who had little or no control over the events that fired the murderers -- then atoned for their crimes in orgies of ritual suicide . The bloody melodrama was terrible theater , yet most Japanese loved it , reveled in it , were inspired by it . Ancient racial memories were renewed with flowing fresh red blood . New sacrifices propitiated savage urges ... and mesmerized the audience . Patriotic murder was sadistic , Masako thought , an obscene perversion that surfaced when the world pressed relentlessly in upon the Japanese , as it had in the 1930s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparently was ... Now ? She could scarcely place one foot in front of another . Oh , Naruhito , beloved husband , that we should have to face this ... and I should not be at your side .... She turned and hurried back toward her husband . Toward the evil that awaited them both . She ran , the length of her stride constrained by her skirt . Just before she reached the corner , she heard the singing of the sword and then the sickening thunk as it bit into flesh . She turned the corner in time to see her husband 's head rolling along the floor and his upright torso toppling forward . She saw no more . Despite her pain -- or perhaps because of it -- she passed out , collapsed in a heap . Shunko Kato did not look again at the emperor 's corpse . There was little time , and staring at the body of a man who had failed Japan would be wasting it . He arranged a letter on the table where the sword had rested . The letter was written in blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had all signed it . For Japan . Kato knelt and drew his knife . He looked at his chief NCO , who was standing beside him , his pistol in his hand . " Banzai , " he said . " Banzai . " Kato stabbed the knife to the hilt in his own stomach . The sergeant raised his pistol and shot Kato in the back of the head . Blood and brains flew from the captain 's head . The sound of the shot made a stupendous thunderclap in the hallway . In the silence that followed , he could hear the tinny sound of the spent cartridge skittering across the floor . Air escaping from the captain 's body made an audible sound , but the sergeant was paying no attention . He looked at his comrades . They , too , had their pistols out . Brave men , doing what had to be done . The sergeant took a deep breath , then raised the barrel of his pistol to his own head . The others did the same . The sergeant inadvertently squeezed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
