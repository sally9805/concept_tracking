<p> Hillary Clinton , wife of Democratic presidential candidate Bill Clinton , was in Charlotte , N.C. , this week to campaign and tour an adult literacy center . <p> During the trip , she talked with Charlotte Observer staff writer Tim Funk on everything from her role in a Clinton administration to women 's efforts to juggle family and career . Here are excerpts : <p> Q : I 'm sure you 've heard this quote , but I 'd love to know what you think of it : " If the wife comes through as being too strong and too intelligent , it makes the husband look like a wimp . " That was Richard Nixon , speaking about you and your husband . <p> A : Well , I think anybody who either knows my husband or has followed this campaign knows that he 's tough enough , strong enough and decisive enough not only to be president but to enjoy women who have contributions to make as well . <p> Q : Do you think a sizable percentage of the voters share Nixon 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comment is a generational one , that it 's understandable in the context of the times in which he grew up . But I do n't think it is representative of what 's happening in the country today where many women are taking leading roles in so many areas of our lives and are working closely with men to make life better in both the private and public sector . <p> Q : Do you think there are still unwritten rules about the conduct of wives of would-be presidents ? And are you breaking those rules ? <p> A : What I have tried to do to be a wife , a mother , have my own profession , plus be active in the community , is a balancing act that millions and millions of women of my age and younger have engaged in . And so we do n't know what to expect these days because , when my mother was growing up and making her choices , they were more limited than the choices available to women in America today . <p> Q : You said that many women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , though , have had to do it on as public a stage as you . I wonder how tough that 's been and whether you 'd have any advice for people that may follow . <p> A : Well , I think it has been tough because it 's been in the public arena . But I do n't think it 's all that much different from what millions of women and men go through every day . <p> Q : But when other people do things , they do n't get columns written about them or telegrams from Tammy Wynette or magazine articles . <p> A : That 's right . <p> Q : Were you ready for that glare ? <p> A : I do n't know that anyone is ever ready for what happens in a presidential campaign because it is unlike anything that anyone has ever experienced . <p> It 's kind of like being a mother . . . . Until you 've had your own , it 's not like anything you 've been through before . <p> Q : Let me ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How has she held up under the barrage of stories and columns about her mother and her father ? What do you tell her ? What does she tell you ? <p> A : Because she has always had a father in public life - she was born when we were living in the Arkansas governor 's mansion in 1980 - this is not brand-new to her . <p> Starting when she was about the age of 6 , we began telling her that in politics people said mean things . They even told lies . <p> I remember telling her this and her dad explaining to her and she just looked stunned . Her eyes got really big and she said , " Well , why would they do that ? " And her daddy said , " Well , honey , I do n't know , but that 's the kind of thing that happens . And we just want you to understand that . " <p> Q : Let 's fast-forward to January 1993 and say that President Clinton is settling in . Are you sitting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adviser ? Or are you off pursuing your own agenda ? <p> A : I am not going to have any kind of paid position . I 'm not going to be in the Cabinet . That 's not how we 've ever worked together . I have a set of issues that are of great interest to me that Bill knows about and we 've worked on together , that I 've cared about for more than two decades . <p> For example , I 've chaired two commissions that Bill appointed . One , in his first term , on access to rural health care . And the commission came up with recommendations , which he then reviewed and largely implemented . Then in 1983 , I chaired a commission on reforming Arkansas education . . . . He then put together a legislative package . I testified for it . I talked with people . That 's the kind of role I feel comfortable playing . <p> Q : I hear people say , " I wish SHE were running . " Do you hear that ? And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , sometimes I do . But I think that it 's more because of the issues that Bill and I are trying to talk about . You know , there are millions of people in our country who know that the country is going in the wrong direction . And if they have n't had a chance to meet Bill or hear him speak , if they hear me speak and I 'm talking about issues that they 've thought about but which have not been part of the presidential leadership for more than a decade , they are excited by it . <p> Q : Would you like to run for anything yourself at some point ? An article in the May Vanity Fair hinted you were interested at some point in the governor 's race in Arkansas . <p> A : No . What is true is that people have talked to me about running for office ever since I was a little girl . And I 've never seriously entertained that . <p> Q : Vanity Fair also did a poll : 53 percent of those they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with your husband was more of a " professional arrangement " than a " real marriage . " What would you say to that 53 percent ? <p> A : I 'd say they do n't know my husband or me or they do n't know anything about our marriage . <p> Q : You said on " 60 Minutes " that the problems you and your husband had had actually strengthened your marriage . <p> A : That 's right . <p> Q : In what way ? <p> A : Well , I think anyone who has ever been in a marriage that has overcome any challenges knows that if you stay committed and you are honest with each other , that it can be one of the most rewarding experiences of your life . And you end up in a much different and better place than from where you started . <p> Q : One last question from Vanity Fair : The magazine suggested that in 1982 , you remade yourself . You took your husband 's name , got rid of the glasses , dyed your hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your husband wanted to be re-elected in conservative Arkansas . <p> A : Well , only one of those things happened in 1982 . In 1982 , when Bill ran for office again , I made the decision I would use his name for all purposes because it was very difficult for a lot of the people in our state to understand . <p> I thought it was the right decision at the time we were married to use my maiden name because I knew he was going to be in public life and I really did n't want people believing that , since I wanted to practice law , that I was in any way using my husband 's position . And I did n't want him to be in any way burdened by what I was going to try to do in my profession . And then after I realized that it was confusing for a lot of people , I made the other decision . <p> Now on the other things , gosh , you know , I started trying to wear contact lenses when I was 16 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my eyes was torture . And I used to walk around when I was in college with one eye scrunched up and the other one tearing like crazy . And it was n't until probably a year or two or three after ' 82 that I finally figured out how to wear soft contact lenses , that I finally got the right solution to clean them and all that . <p> And , gee , I think changing your hairstyle is half the fun of being a woman .
