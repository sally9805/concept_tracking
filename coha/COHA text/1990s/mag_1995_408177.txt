He 's the Ned Overend , the Juli Furtado , of his chosen discipline . But you 've probably never heard of John Stamstad because he plies his trade where the miles are big and the prize money is small . Stamstad is an ultramarathon mountain bike racer . Maybe the best . Name a long-distance off-road race in this country and Stamstad has probably won it . He 's a 3-time champion of Iditabike , a 160-mile race through Alaska 's winter wilderness . Last year he won the inaugural Leadville Trail 100 , becoming the only rider to break 8 hours on the 100-mile course above 9,000 feet in Colorado 's Rockies . He won the Wilderness 101 in Pennsylvania , despite breaking his collarbone with 81 miles to go . He won Colorado 's 24-hour Montezuma 's Revenge , which endlessly hopscotches the Continental Divide . In ' 92 he was leading the 3,300-mile Race Across Australia when the ill-fated event collapsed near the halfway point . ( Stamstad finished anyway . ) He set an off-road 24-hour record of 275 miles in ' 92 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll try to break the mark again in July at Mammoth Lakes , California . " John has n't done too many races he does n't have the course record for , " says Henry Kingman , a friend and fellow ultramarathon rider . " He 's been so good for so long . He always looked at himself as a pro even before he was one . Few people in ultramarathon racing take it that seriously . " Stamstad , 29 , rides for Team Ritchey , home of stylish European off-road stars such as Thomas Frischknecht . But Stamstad is a different breed , as his long , scraggly red hair and beard suggest . Driven but with a wry sense of humor , thin as a bladed spoke but with a weakness for doughnuts , he races not so much against other riders as he does against weather and terrain and the voice inside that whispers it 's OK to quit . A few days after winning this year 's Iditabike , Stamstad met with Bicycling to talk about his ultramarathon life . BICYCLING : We understand Iditabike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was long  --  my longest one yet  --  25 hours , 39 minutes . Two years ago I did it in 15 hours . Last year was just under 16 hours . But winning times can be anywhere from 15 to 30 hours and you never know how long it 's going to take . There are n't any other races I know of like that . At Iditabike things can change instantly . Bad weather can come in .... This year a lot of wind created snowdrifts on the course , which made the going slower for the first half of the race . I was able to ride probably more than anyone . It helps that I 'm lighter , so I can float on top of the snow more . A few pounds is the difference between riding on top of the snow or crunching through it . Then you have to walk . But in the second half of the race , I had severe stomach cramps , diarrhea  --  an absolute nightmare . Going into the last checkpoint was scary . There 's no bailout . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a frozen river at 20 degrees below zero and no one 's there to save you . I stopped at the checkpoint for over 4 hours trying to get my stomach back together , but it did n't happen . Then dawn came . At least if something happened I 'd be seen . When I left the last checkpoint , I took a roll of toilet paper ; when I had to go , I just dropped trou ' and went . I did n't drink any water that whole last section because my CamelBak froze and water did n't sit well anyway . Basically , I dried out and was fine . That 's the first time I 've been in a race when I really doubted I could finish . In some ways that 's always been a goal of mine  --  I keep doing harder and harder events , maybe in the back of my mind trying to find the one that breaks me . BI : It sounds like the Race Across Australia came pretty close to breaking everyone . How brutal was that ? JS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stage race of 10-11 hours a day over brutal washboard roads . It just destroyed people . Forty-three people started , and after 7 days only 9 people were officially left . They just could n't handle the physical and emotional stress . And it was n't just the biking stress ; it was the living stress . At the end of the day , you 'd get a bucket of about a gallon of water to wash yourself and your bike clothes . You were sleeping in a tent in the sand . You had to wake up at 4 a.m . You had to do all your own bike-mechanic work . There were thorns everywhere , so you were paranoid about getting a flat and having to chase back to the group . It was fascinating to watch how people under stress changed . People completely shifted personalities . They turned against their friends . Overall that was probably the most challenging race I 've ever done . I would n't say it was the hardest physically , but the combination of physical and mental stress .... BI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that month , I aged 2 or 3 years . And I really grew up . But my personality did n't change and that 's something I 'm most proud of . There is n't anything I did that I regret . There are certainly people there who do n't like me . I 'm sure the organizer hates me . And some of the racers do n't like me , but that 's the nature of racing . It really gave me confidence that I was able to maintain myself . I think that 's part of the reason I succeed in ultramarathon races . I see a lot of people  --  even in a 24-hour race  --  whose personalities change when they get tired or sleep-deprived . They start screaming at their crew , they get a little schizy . Whereas even when I 'm tired , I can still maintain that reality check . That 's the reason I keep doing it . If I felt my personality changed , I do n't think I 'd do it . It would scare me too much if I started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BI : At 3 a.m. you might be 18 hours into a 24-hour time trial or record attempt . What 's it like to ride this type of event ? JS : I 've set the 24-hour off-road record twice , in ' 92 and ' 93 , at Mammoth . The course is a 9-mile loop with 550 feet of climbing , 2 stream crossings , and volcanic sand , ash , and rock . It 's at about 8,000 feet elevation . The first year my battery charger went out . I had to ride almost 9 miles with a key-chain squeeze-light clenched in my teeth . It was a tiny spot of light . And of course you ca n't breathe very well with something clenched in your mouth . After a couple of miles my jaw started to cramp , so I switched it to my hand . Then I ran for a bit . The second year my bottom bracket broke and I had to ride 200 miles with no bearings . I overhauled it when I got done and there was just dust in there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . One of the keys to succeeding in these events is not to take it too personally . I think it was Terry Waite , one of the Lebanon hostages , who said he resolved 3 things when he was taken prisoner : Have no self-pity , no false sentimentality , and no regrets . That 's a good outlook in general and especially when you 're in a challenging situation . It 's nothing personal . That battery charger did not attack me . It just went out and I had to deal with it . In almost every race I do , something goes wrong . That 's another factor that draws me to these events . I keep seeking the perfect race where absolutely nothing goes wrong , but I do n't even know if that 's feasible because they 're so difficult and stressful on the body and the equipment . A better attitude to have is not necessarily to prevent anything from going wrong , but when something does go wrong , cope with it . Solve the problem , do n't let it destroy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Montezuma 's Revenge . What 's that 24-hour race like ? JS : It 's a series of loops . The first is 130 miles long and has 4 or 5 major Colorado mountain passes , with dirt-road climbs and descents . The second loop is your worst nightmare . You ride from 10,000 to 12,000 feet elevation , then you disassemble your bike and attach it to a frame pack . You hike from 12,000 to 14,000 feet  --  and there is no trail . Then you down-hike the back side of the ridge to 12,000 feet , reassemble your bike , and ride on to loops 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , and 9 . It 's brutal terrain , steep and way above tree line . Each loop usually has some pushing and sometimes bushwhacking . None of the trails is marked . This race also interests me because there 's something extra . You have to find a way to pack your bike up and over that mountain . You have to train differently , because hiking up is fine for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you climb a real 14,000-foot mountain  --  that was emotionally rewarding . BI : Sounds like you prefer races that are n't just a matter of brute strength on the bike . JS : Yeah . I like races with something more . It makes you think twice about why you 're doing it . You really have to draw on your inner strength . It takes an enormous amount of talent to win a 2-hour mountain bike race , but you never get to the point where you say , " God , I do n't know if I can make it ... I have to make it . " Whereas in the longer races you almost always get to that point . I think it was Ironman triathlete Mark Allen who said it 's like facing the dark side . The dark side is failure , and nobody wants to fail . In longer races you always reach the point when it 's easy to stop and quit . Or you can keep going . You have to make that decision . BI : How do you handle that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race that I 'm not going to quit no matter what . That way , I never have to decide whether to quit , because it 's just not an option . If you go into a race saying , " If I get really tired , I 'll just stop , " no matter how mentally strong you are you 'll take the easy way out . BI : Do you have any particular event in mind that would be your crowning ultra marathon achievement ? JS : There are a few outrageous things I 'd like to do , like the 6-day indoor track record , which is a 2-man relay . The record , set in 1914 , is 2,759 miles . It would be painfully boring , but they used to race like that . They were unbelievable athletes . They 'd set 24-hour records , then compete in a match sprint a few days later . I really respect that last generation of athlete . Some of the records I want to do go back to the glory years of cycling . I 'd also love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want to find a way to do the routes of the Paris-Dakar and Baja 1000 car races on a bicycle . BI : What about the Race Across America ? JS : When I first started cycling , that was my main goal , because I thought it was the hardest race you could do . But having done the Race Across Australia , I 'm not so sure RAAM is the hardest . I like the idea of riding nonstop for days on end , but whether I do RAAM depends on financial reasons . It 's incredibly expensive . The only other knock I have against it is that it 's become a team sport . Your support crew is so much of the event . You have an entourage  --  a follow van , a motor home . A lot of guys are wired for sound . They have walkie-talkies ; they 're in constant contact . I find myself much more drawn now to the events where it 's competitor against competitor . It 's man versus man , man versus self , and man versus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matters . That 's what these ultramarathon bike races get to . I like the individuality of it . The other thing is , I do n't mind putting myself through a lot of stress and discomfort during a race . I do have a problem putting other people through that because of me . That 's what you 're doing to your support crew in a race like RAAM . BI : You 're also seen at quite a few regular mountain bike races , which seems at odds with riding ultramarathon events . How do you design your training ? JS : It 's not that much different from a conventional racer 's . A lot of people think I do megamiles , and in the past I did . I used to try to ride 30 hours a week . But I 've really scaled that back in the last year or two because I 've been training more by heart-rate monitor . Now I ride about 20-25 hours a week . What I 've cut out are long , easy rides . I probably do a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard day for me would be 30-60 minutes above 175 heart beats per minute and 2-3 hours at 155-175 . Stamstad 's maximum heart rate is 193 ; his resting pulse is 38 . You have to be careful , though , because there are diminishing returns to riding above 175 . If I put in too much time at maximum heart rate , I 'm not going to be able to ride for hours and hours in that middle zone I also need to train at . BI : What are some common mistakes you see beginning long-distance riders making ? JS : The number one thing is not eating enough . Even if you 're just riding for fitness or to lose weight , the worst thing you can do is to starve yourself . When your body goes into starvation mode , you crave fat . You want to binge eat and those calories go more toward fat . If I bonk on a training ride , I 'll eat a gigantic meal when I get done . You 'd think I would n't have any body fat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I crave fat and end up gaining weight . Two days after a 24-hour race I probably weigh more than I did before it . The worst thing you can do is limit the calories during the event . Finish your ride not starving . My body fat dropped significantly last year when I started eating more during a ride . I get done and I just have a normal meal . BI : There 's not a lot of good mountain biking in Cincinnati where you live . How do you stay sharp ? JS : In some ways I see bike handling as being pretty simple . You know where you want the bike to go and it 's just a matter of putting it there . I could certainly do better if I lived where I could train off-road , but I do n't have that . No place is perfect . It 's just another one of my challenges . In some ways it 's an advantage because my competition expects less of me : " You 're from Ohio so you ca n't possibly do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true . I 'll probably move to a more **26;339;TOOLONG location in the future , but right now I 'm relatively happy . BI : How 'd you even become attracted to long distance , let alone off-road long distance ? JS : I got into cycling by touring . I just loved riding my bike all day long . I heard about the Bike Across Missouri  --  St. Louis to Kansas City and back nonstop , about 550 miles . I did that and did really well , and I was hooked . Ever since , I 've been seeking out events . There were more good mountain bike events than road events , so I flowed into that . BI : Can you make a living at this ? JS : I can , but most people could n't live the way I do . I live pretty much in the margins . I 'm comfortable living ... I do n't know if you want to call it a life of poverty , but I make very little money . I have very few expenses , though . Part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's really cheap . And I can do the freelance photography work that supports me . Most any bike racer who 's tried to do this knows you give up a lot . I do n't own a single pair of jeans without holes . Yesterday I bought my first pair of new shoes I 've had in ages , and they 're a cheap pair . The only thing I spend money on is food . That , and things that relate in some way to cycling . The cycling purchases are tax-deductible , and that 's how I get by . BI : Would you describe yourself as an intense person ? JS : In a bike race I can be incredibly intense . When I 'm sitting around the house , I 'm really mild-mannered . As a kid I was painfully shy and I had to work hard to overcome that . In some ways that gave me strength . I 've never avoided things I 've been afraid of . I moved to Colorado and took a job as a ski-hill photographer . People come off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sell them on getting their photograph taken . Well , being shy , that was my biggest fear in the world . It was rough at first , but I overcame that and got good at it . I 've just continued to do that . I see people who are n't shy and I say , " I want to be more like that . And I try to mold myself into that . BI : But still you enjoy the solitude of ultramarathon racing ? JS : I love it . You ca n't do this unless you like being alone . It 's an incredible time to think . When you 're alone and you get to that weak point  --  when you get really tired and it 's easy to quit  --  everything becomes clear . You get really honest with yourself . Whenever you break yourself down that far , you break your inhibitions down also . A lot of time you can fake it and cover it up . But at 3 in the morning of a 24-hour race , nothing is hidden . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
