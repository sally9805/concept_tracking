AS ELEGANT AND DISCREET AS ITS owner , Oliver Hoare 's Ahuan Gallery is a curiously uninviting place these days . On posh Eccleston Street in London 's Belgravia , the gallery where Hoare , 49 , sold Islamic art to clients including Queen Noor of Jordan and the Sultan of Brunei looks deserted : No one answers the door , and the reception desk is unattended . A month after London papers broke the story that the dashing Hoare had received over 300 anonymous phone calls believed to be from the Princess of Wales , the only artifact in the display window is , symbolically , a suit of armor . Since being pegged as the man with whom the princess is obsessed , Hoare has found himself under attack from all sides . Fleet Street 's finest have been camping out at the $3.5 million house on Chelsea 's fashionable Tregunter Road where he lives with wife Diane , 46 , and their children Tristan , 17 , Damien , 15 , and Olivia , 12 . Tabloids are gleefully reporting that , instead of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Diana when her marriage was foundering , Hoare is a compulsive charmer who had a fiery liaison with a Turkish-born socialite . And behind the scenes , insiders are hinting that his relationship with Di , 33 , may not have been platonic . " The consensus is that they definitely had an affair , " says one seasoned Di-watcher . " No question about Diana became complete besotted with him . " Palace-watchers also claim that Prince Charles and longtime lover Camilla Parker Bowles ( also a close friend of Hoare 's ) knew of the alleged affair and Di 's phone calls six months before the story emerged in the press . In the words of Daily Mail columnist Nigel Dempster , Charles 's knowledge of the " burgeoning friendship " between Di and Hoare made Charles fee " less constrained in making his admission . . . that he had broken his marriage vows "  --  a confession offered in an interview with freelance broadcaster Jonathan Dimbleby on ITV last June . Hoare 's professional life has come under scrutiny as well . In recent weeks , London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  as much as $700,000 last year  --  and that he once sold a valuable page from an early Koran that proved to have been stolen . Though colleagues who will speak on the record characterize his business dealings as " utterly beyond reproach , " it came to light following a 1989 burglary at his gallery that Hoare had overinsured some antiques for more than 10 times their real value . On Sept. 7 the tale became still more tantalizing when nude photos of Charles , who is close to both Hoare and his wife , were published by the German paper Bild Zeitung . As it happened , Charles was on a solitary holiday at a chateau near Avignon , France , owned by Diane Hoare 's mother , Baroness Louise de Waldner , when paparazzi caught him toweling off in his bedroom . Besides creating an uproar over the intrusion , the incident demonstrated just how close the two families are  --  and how little Charles seemed to mind that his wife has been under Hoare 's spell . Says one royal-watcher : " The fact that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was unfolding is evidence that he 's still friendly with Oliver . I do n't think Charles really cares if Hoare was having an affair with Diana or not . " Adds Lady Colin Campbell , author of Diana , the Princess Nobody Knows : " Why would Charles mind ? He has nothing to do with the woman . The fact that he knew of the affair is a sign of his complete indifference . " In the wake of these embarrassments , Hoare retreated to the safety of his antique-filled home , where he vents his frustrations in what he calls his screaming room  --  a soundproof haven where he copes with stress by yelling at the top of his lungs . He emerged from his house briefly on Aug. 28 for a stroll with son Damien , but politely declined to answer questions from the press . As friends tell it , the man whom Diana chose as a confidant has always been known for his discretion . " He 's an oldfashioned gentleman , " says Dale Egee , proprietor of a London gallery called Egee Art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a retiring , even vulnerable manner that is very appealing to women . " The son of Reginald Hoare , a civil servant , and his wife , Irina , Hoare studied at the Sorbonne after graduating from Eton in 1963 . Fascinated with Iran , he found a mentor in Princess Hamoush Azodi-Bowler , who invited him to stay at the Tehran mansion where she played host to a circle of artistic young aristocrats . ( It was there that Hoare met business partner David Sulzberger , whose family owns The New York Times . ) " Everybody loved him , " Azodi-Bowler told the Daily Mail . " He played the guitar and sang beautifully . . . at parties he would dedicate different songs to different women . " Described by a friend who spoke to the Daily Mail as an " extravagantly pretty " young man " who would turn the heads of both men and women , " Hoare began to move in ever more exalted circles . After returning to London he set up a gallery that attracted customers including Rudolf Nureyev and in 1974 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose mother is close to the Queen Mum . It was eight years after the Hoares ' 1976 wedding that Oliver met Charles at a Windsor Castle house party . The prince struck up a friendship with the worldly Hoare , who became a frequent visitor at Highgrove , Charles 's home in Gloucestershire . By the late 1980s , Hoare had also befriended Diana , who shared his love of ballet . That relationship seems not to have become ciose , however , until 1992 , when Hoare helped to cushion the breakup for both Charles and Di . By that time , his own marriage was still recovering from his six-month fling with ex-beauty queen Ayesha Nadir , whose estranged husband , clothing tycoon Asil Nadir , had been a client . On Aug. 28 , Ayesha , now divorced , told the News of the World that the affair began in 1986 , when Hoare offered her solace after she learned that Nadir 's mistress had borne him two children . Traced to her villa on the Bosphorus , Hoare 's ex-lover ( who reportedly left him after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Evening Standard , " Oliver is such a refined man . It is hard to resist his charms . " Di , too , apparently found Hoare difficult to resist . " I think she fell in love with Oliver , maybe because she 's never been loved properly , " Ayesha told the News of the World . Though it is unclear just whenr whether  --  the two had a physical relationship , Diana seems to have been infatuated with Hoare by September 1992 , three months before the Waleses separated and the anonymous calls began . Although Diana reportedly was silent whenever Hoare answered , she is said to have shouted " a stream of abuse " when Diane picked up the phone . Although most Di-watchers feel that she made the calls simply to hear Hoare 's voice , Campbell believes that Diane may have been the target . " Diana made those calls to taunt her because she 's jealous , " says Campbell . ( That notion was supported by recent reports that , for years , Parker Bowles received silent calls that she claims were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Diane reportedly believed that the relationship between Di and her husband was getting out of hand ; Dempster said recently that she told Charles that Hoare had " had an affair " with Diana . In any case , it was Diane ( whose money reportedly is helping to offset her husband 's business difficulties ) who demanded that Hoare ask the police to investigate . Still , he declined to press charges after he discovered last January who his caller was , and he apparently did not abandon the princess . According to The Sun , Hoare ( who was still serving as a liaison between the Waleses ) called Diana " at least 15 times " in the days following a March 14 dinner with friends at a Chinese restaurant , after which he returned with her to the palace . " A royal source " told the paper that one call last April " started at around 8:30 at night and went on for close to 90 minutes . Who knows what was being talked about , but they obviously had plenty on their minds . " At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Iying low will solve at least one of his problems  --  that of being stalked by a rowdy crowd of newsmen . Whether it can quell Diana 's obsession remains to be seen . Last month , the News ofthe World reported that the distressed princess rang Hoare 's home seven times during a four-day period in late August  --  after the tabloids had reported that she was hounding him . Telling the housekeeper that she had to " speak to Oliver urgently , " the princess reportedly hung up when she was told it was impossible . In the weeks to come , it seems , that " screaming room " may come in handy . <p>
