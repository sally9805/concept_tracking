had said , swathed in large paper napkins , " just get her away from here . " Then she closed her eyes , and her boyfriend , Ramon , nodded , so I took Wanda 's mother to a Chinese dumpling shop . <p> Once there , she told me the old story about how Wanda 's father wanted to name her Espinaca . Spinach , in Spanish . How Wanda was a whiny child who never could decide on what flavor of ice cream to order . Once they had to leave the store without any ice cream at all . <p> She kept mispronouncing Wanda 's boyfriend 's name and dropping dumplings . Finally she stabbed a dumpling through the middle with one chopstick and used the other chopstick to saw it in half . " I just love other cultures , " she said , " but this is ridiculous . " <p> Wanda 's mother : long , gray hair in a single braid , with cheekbones that shot her face forward into your business . Wearing a purple smock with orange trim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you think they 're done ? Oh my . Oh my shit . " <p> I said , " It 's going to be okay , Nancy , " or some stupid thing . She stared at me . <p> " This is my granddaughter or grandson , theoretically . Although a fetus is n't yet a human being . And a woman has a right to choose . But someone 's vacuuming out my daughter 's insides . Since she came from my insides , et cetera , things are n't as separate as you think , missy . And let me tell you , if it had been legal in my time , I would have done the exact same thing with Wanda . " Wanda 's mother straightened her smock . <p> " So do you have regrets now ? With Wanda ? " <p> " There 's always regret after you act , or do n't act . That 's true of any big decision . " <p> She was so imperious with her garish clothes and outdated perfume , I said , " Will you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped laughing with a frown and put her hand on her stomach . <p> When I came back to the clinic , Wanda asked , " How is she ? " She was hooking her bra and pulling her sweatshirt over her head . <p> " Fine , " I said . " Stoically liberal . " <p> " Where is she ? " <p> " Getting sick in the bathroom . " <p> We waited at the ladies ' room door for Wanda 's mother until she reemerged , smiling at Wanda with watery eyes and arms stretched out . " My baby , " Wanda 's mother said , then halted , knowing she had said the wrong thing . <p> Me , I lost my own mother , although she 's still alive . Some nights in my apartment I light a fifty-cent glass candle with a picture of St. Jude painted on one side . I recite the prayer pasted on the back  --  Oracion a San Judas Tadeo  --  knowing little Spanish , besides espinaca and some swear words . " Glorioso apostol , San Judas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother back to me , " but the painted face says , There are other mothers . <p> I dated Macon for two years because his mother took my arm when I met her and said , " Make sure he eats broccoli , okay ? " <p> For me , more than a mother . She was my second-chance mama . I loved her , hemmed my pants for her . I followed her around her apartment , asking questions : How do you knit ? What are basted eggs ? <p> Macon 's mother prefaced her sentences with " Guess what ? " She told guests that I was her third daughter , which caused confusion when Macon and I held hands and kissed . <p> I learned the rules  --  what to cook for holidays , what to say about the movies we saw together . If there was a dog in the movie , it was a good movie . If there were guns in the movie , it was a good movie . <p> Macon 's mother thought I needed " toning down , " so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There You Are . <p> " Buckaroo Banzai , " I said . <p> " And likewise to you , " she said . She spelled Chanukah wrong on the card , but I 'd imagine that most Southern Baptists would . <p> " You run around too much . You need to smell those roses . " With each word , she pounded the cutting board with her sharp fist . <p> " It 's hard to manage my time . A girl 's got to make a living , " I told her , dicing garlic . <p> " It 's just as easy to fall in love with a rich man as it is to fall in love with a poor one . Marilyn Monroe said so , and look how well she turned out . " <p> I stared . <p> She amended , " Well , before that overdose business . Anyway , " pointing the turkey baster at me , " you need a rich one . " <p> " But what about Macon ? " I asked her . Her son . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He pulled a hair out of his mouth , then looked at it . <p> " Oh , " she said . " Well , there is that . " <p> She called the day I broke up with Macon . I cried so hard , the phone kept slipping from my hand . <p> " I 'm just so shocked , " she said . <p> I mumbled something that had no words . <p> " Lunch , " she promised . At her house . I 'm still waiting to be fed . <p> When I was small , my mother told me the things that a mother tells little girls in order to get along . She told me that when you drink something hot , never sip it the first time . Instead , dip your top lip into the cup . That way it looks like you 're drinking , but instead you 're testing . <p> " What if you burn your lip ? " I asked . <p> " It 's not as bad as a tongue . " <p> So I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was too hot . I thought of what would hurt least  --  an elbow , an earlobe . Nowadays I poke my finger in the cup , even in restaurants , on dates . <p> My mother told me , " No , serial killers are not people who kill cereal . No , numbers have no smell . No , dead bugs do n't dream . " <p> She arranged concentric circles of bite-sized dabs of cream cheese in a pastel plastic bowl . I scooped them up with my fingers and poked them into my mouth . She picked my grapes off their spines . She pretended that my sandwich could talk , flapping its bready lips . " Eat me , " it growled in her hands . <p> My mother sang " You Are My Sunshine , " skipping over the part about waking up and finding your sunshine gone . She pulled warm clothes out of the dryer and dropped them on top of me at naptime . <p> She said , " There are 2.8 calories in each and every stamp . " <p> She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come from rain . <p> Next was Frederick . His mother had grown up poor in the Depression . She often quizzed me : <p> " Do you ever leave the knife in the peanut butter jar and just close it up tight like this ? " She screwed the top on . The knife clunked thickly inside . When I said , " No , never , " she put the jar back on the shelf . " Saves , " she said , nodding her head . <p> " Do you ever leave the cheese cutter in the bag with the cheese ? Saves . " <p> " Do you ever put the cooking pot in the refrigerator with the food still in it ? Saves . " <p> She told me about sewing across the toes of her old torn socks and putting them on her kids ' feet so they 'd be warm walking to school , with socks that ran all the way up their legs . <p> During her entire weeklong visit , she insisted on staying in our one-bedroom apartment . She said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chocolate bar , and I 'm happy as two clams . " We gave her our bed and slept on the floor ourselves . In the morning she said that the mattress was a bit hard , which it was . <p> She said , " There are three ways of telling time : where you lived , where you worked , and whom you went out with . It 's a good idea to keep these things written down on a piece of paper . " <p> When I lived with Frederick , I loved him with a subtle desperation that was tied to anticipated loss . I watched my diet , eating whole grains . I washed everything twice . I put pennies in a jar , skimped on tips . When he finally did leave me , I felt dazed and relieved . As if my grip had grown so tight , only after it was broken could I again move my hands . <p> Frederick 's mother did n't call me . She was on a singles ' cruise at the time of the breakup , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote his goodbye note on the back of our electric bill , which was in his name . I tore it up with the tips of my fingers and flushed it down the toilet , a silly smile on my face . " Saves , " I said . <p> When I was about six , my mother had begun sleeping all the time . <p> She took a nap right after making my stepfather 's tepid breakfast and sacking any lunches for the day . The kiss at the door , then she moved toward the couch as if she were walking down the middle of a canoe . Once outside , I watched her through the tinted front windows of the house . Every morning she fell backward onto the couch , picked up her book , laid it like a tent on her pink terrycloth chest , and closed her eyes . Then I ran off to the waiting bus at the bus stop . <p> My teacher showed us the parts of a peanut . She told the girls , You can be firemen , or mailmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fists when my mother typed up her resume , and my mother 's bruised face the next morning . <p> After school I always rushed home to tell my mother all the new ways I had learned that she was wrong . She was usually awake when I came home , with her cheek creased from the seams of the upholstered couch pillow . She poured orange juice and pulled out the peanut butter jar . Then she left me an open-faced sandwich with the spoon still stuck in the middle as she went to lie down . <p> At night , after my stepfather hung up his pants and my mother toppled back to the sofa , I went upstairs to my room , there being no other place . Hoping my mother would n't wake up as my stepfather locked my bedroom door behind him , saying , " You like this " ; as I said , " Okay . " <p> When I finally told her , she kicked him out . After a couple of years . <p> " You ruined my marriage , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she was walking down the street with her mother . Six or seven teenage boys started hooting from a fire escape railing . " Hey , baby , hey , mama , " things like that . Wanda 's mother stopped in the street , confused . Encouraged , the boys yelled more loudly and lewdly , and Wanda started tugging at her arm . " Come on , Mom ! " She knew the boys from school . Finally , Wanda 's mother put her hands on her hips , looked up , and shouted , " If you boys do n't cut that out , I 'm going to come up there and rape you . " They shut up , abruptly . Wanda cried from embarrassment then , but when she tells the story now , she laughs so hard that she has to go to the bathroom . <p> I had been seeing Jake for a year when his mother announced her second visit . It was close to Mother 's Day . After we hung up the phone with her , my left eyelid swelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had gotten a rash all over my upper arms and inner thighs . <p> She pinched my shoulder when she saw me . " The weight looks good on you , " she said . I was n't aware that I had accumulated weight , and when we ate lunch together , I ordered a cheeseburger and thought , Fuck it . <p> That night Jake wanted to have sex , but I wondered if he was thinking about his mother , too . So we held hands as he slept and I did n't . With my other hand , I pinched the skin over my stomach and thought of that old commercial , " Can You Pinch an Inch ? " I pinched many inches , then lay in bed with pinch-bruises tingling on my skin . <p> The next day , we picked up Jake 's mother at her hotel . In the lobby she suggested that I take Jake 's last name , " just in case . " His last name is Holtzenweiser . Jake asked her , " Are you serious ? " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It was good enough for me , " she said . <p> I had plucked some eyelashes out of my left eye in the attempt to reduce the swelling . I plucked a few too many . Jake 's mother asked , " What happened , a kitchen fire ? " She was sympathetic , so I said yes . Jake wrapped a strong arm around me and announced that he had bought twenty lottery tickets . " We 've all got it made , " he said . <p> Jake 's mother checked out of her hotel the last night of her visit and stayed at our place . Making dinner , I pulled baked olives out of the hot oven . I forgot to put the mitts on first . I managed to deposit the sizzling glass pot safely on the stovetop before running to the freezer and grabbing the ice cube trays . Jake pulled at my hands and told me to let him see . They were white and already blistered . <p> Jake 's mother wrapped them in clean dishrags and taped them shut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jake fed me dinner with a fork . His mother pretended that this was ordinary . <p> Later , I heard them talking in the next room while I lay in bed . I could n't hear their words , but I knew that they were talking about me from their voices . I did hear " poor thing , " the one thing I was supposed to hear . I translated it into Spanish , then Japanese . Pobrecita . Kawaiso . <p> The day Jake 's mother left , I watched him make sandwiches for her plane ride . He sliced havarti cheese , tomatoes , avocados , and then stuffed sprouts in the cracks . She packed her dirty socks into neat rolls . <p> She started to kiss me goodbye at the door , but I was beginning a bad cold and did n't want to infect her . My nose itched , and my eyes were watering . How much more of this can I take ? I thought . We walked her outside . <p> " Bye , Mary Margaret , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Call me Mom , " she said , and I waved . She was n't my mother . My mother sent me Water Pik attachments for my birthday if she remembered , which she did n't that year . My mother said that I was her least favorite child , although I was her only child . My mother said , " Do n't call me , I 'll call you , " and did n't . <p> When Jake 's mother called , safely home , we said that I was fine now . We pretended that this was true . <p> However , eyelid swollen , hands wrapped in gauze , sneezing on the couch , I thought about how my body comes from somebody 's body . This is what 's true . Yet impossible . <p> A few months after he left , my stepfather came back for a few weeks . My mother stopped sleeping and spent a lot of time doing laundry . My stepfather called me Liar . " Hi , Liar . How was school today ? " When I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sure it was . " <p> One evening he made a lot of noise reading the newspaper . He kept hitting it in the middle to make it stand straight up in the air , and when it buckled over , he swore and slapped it against the arm of the sofa . I tried to concentrate on my homework at the kitchen table , but made the mistake of saying a vocabulary word aloud , trying to memorize it . I think the word was " infantile . " My stepfather sprang out of sofa and charged toward me . He grabbed my arm , pushed me through the kitchen past my mother and through the back door . <p> About six inches of snow lay on the ground , and I had no shoes or socks on my feet . They were already hurting , beginning to numb in the snow . I looked through the kitchen window at my mother standing inside . She looked back at me through the glass . My stepfather stood next to her and said something in her ear . She put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At first , I was worried that she 'd accidentally cut herself with the knife still gripped in one fist . Without realizing it , my own fists rose to my own hips , and we watched each other , mirror images . She laughed then , slowly , as I shivered in the snow . I could no longer feel my feet , what I was standing on . We stood there and stared at each other until I realized that I was n't standing on anything at all . <p> Wanda 's mother called me at work two months ago . Her voice was loud . I heard the same siren in both of my ears , the one attached to the receiver and the one hanging in the air . " Where are you ? " I asked her . <p> " I 'm in the lobby of your office building , " she said . " How about lunch ? " <p> " Nancy , its nine-thirty in the morning . " <p> " I 'll wait here . They have nice chairs , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't want to set you off schedule . " <p> I hurried downstairs to see her . She wore a pink kimono-dress and balanced a wrapped present on her barely exposed knees . <p> " Happy happy day , " she said . <p> I opened it right there in the lobby , striped paper drifting to the floor . It was a straw hat with purple plastic grapes dangling from one side . <p> " It 's for your head , " she said and fell off her heel suddenly . She smiled , drunk . <p> Down the street , over coffee served in a bowl and beignets , she began to sniffle . <p> " She wo n't talk to me , Wanda wo n't , " she said . She pushed at her long hair , distracted . It stayed where she pushed it , as if underlaid with wires . <p> " What 's the matter ? " I asked again . <p> " She does n't like my house , " she muttered . " She does n't like my boyfriend . She does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number . I think he 's Number 35 . What could that mean ? Oh , I know . She 's cruel , she 's a Nazi , I brought a cruel Nazi into this world . " <p> " She 's not a Nazi , Nancy , " I said , nearly mixing the two words up . <p> " Of course not , " she snapped . " She 's Jewish . " <p> She was sobering up a bit and settling into her hangover . She wore a real cameo on a chain around her neck . <p> " These are good , " she said , picking up a beignet dusted with powdered sugar . <p> I bit into one and inhaled sugar , instantly sputtering and coughing . I tried to hold the coughs while I drank coffee , but my diaphragm shuddered against itself , and I blew bubbles into the cup . Wanda 's mother walloped me on the back with a well-conditioned palm . <p> " Snap out of it , " she said , and I did , suddenly . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you eat , " she told me . <p> " The whole time ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> " But when do you breathe in ? " <p> " When you 're not eating , " she said . <p> " Uh-huh . " <p> Suddenly , I looked at her worn face . It was too late for me . And for her . <p> " You snap out of it , too , " I told her , a little too late for context . <p> She left , as she had the right to do . As soon as she left , there was loss , and there was hunger . I am thirty already , I thought . Thirty . I sat alone at the table for a long time before I finally ate both of our breakfasts , eggs Benedict and trout fried in caper sauce , breathing out the whole time . <p> But sometimes I think of that last time I saw her , my own mother . Together we visited her mother , Grandma Eloise . My grandmother had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who called her " slut " and carried a knife to bed to keep her in line , to her son-in-law who flipped a gun in her face and told her to get out of her own house . Now my grandmother had cataracts and glaucoma . She usually just sat all day in a chair faced away from both the window and the television set . She also had Alzheimer 's but recognized some voices , not mine . My mother 's voice sliced through the stale afternoon . It glanced off the rusted legs of furniture and the ceramic angels rimmed with dust . <p> " Guess who ca n't even wash her own dishes ? " my mother said . " Guess who ca n't manage to keep her drawers clean ? " <p> " Me , me , " said my grandmother . <p> My mother 's mouth formed a tightly pressed smile as she slapped the frozen lasagna onto a cutting board . My grandmother flinched at the noise . <p> I put my hand on my grandmother 's shoulder , but it gave at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my mother clasped her gloved hands above the steering wheel . <p> " I ca n't believe you did all that , " I said . <p> " All what ? " <p> " What if I do that to you when you 're old ? " I asked her . " How would you feel ? " <p> She shrugged . <p> " What happened to you ? " I asked . <p> " What do you mean ? " She looked down at her thin coat , her lap . <p> " How did you get so bitter ? " <p> Her face pursed up . " Listen to you , the big pop psychologist . " Her voice caught a little . <p> Thinking she was hurt , I lowered my voice . " Is it because of your marriage ? " <p> " You 're unfit to talk about my marriage . You 're the reason I 'm alone today . " <p> Staring at the mile markers and the dead scenery , I heard myself say , " You 're no kind of mother . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my head to look at her . Tears poked out of the corners of her eyes , catching in the wrinkles . I was so sorry . And I was n't sorry at all . Past her head , the world shot past too quickly for me to register it . Then it stopped as she pulled over and parked on the side of the road . She left the car running as she took off her gloves . <p> She grabbed my left hand and aligned it with hers , palms facing us . They were perfectly identical  --  like twin maps . Lifeline , love line , the same creases in the thumbs . The crooked forefinger . All the same lines and cracks waiting to happen . <p> " Ha , " she said . I shook my head and tried to pull my hand away . She just gripped it tighter and turned toward me quickly . Her warm breath pushed against my face until I thought I would faint . <p> " If I 'm not your mother , " she asked , " then who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Krouse <p>
