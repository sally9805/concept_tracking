Your head is heavier than you might think , " says Melvin Stewart , preparing to explain for the umpteenth time why breathing to the side is a more efficient way to swim the butterfly than breathing forward . " If you do n't believe me , lie on this table , have someone sit on your butt and lean out over the floor horizontally . Drop your head , and then lift it straight up . You 'll feel the weight . This is n't rocket science . " // Stewart , 23 , is proposing this experiment in a Knoxville , Tenn. , restaurant at the peak of the Saturday dinner rush , and it is suggested to him that the lady who is dining in the next booth might not be quite ready to watch a Mapplethorpe photograph come suddenly to life . " It 's amazing how people embarrass so easily , " he says , his grin widening as he contemplates the future uses of this insight . // Humor may be the sanest response to a life like Stewart 's . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , N.C. , into the finest butterfly swimmer in the world has been a journey of Dickensian twists and turns . He has been snatched from the humble world of Fort Mill ( S.C. ) High School and plunked down on the lush green lawns of the Mercersburg ( Pa . ) Academy . He has dwelt among the sinners of Las Vegas and the " saints " of the PTL ( Praise the Lord ) ministry , and he has discovered that it 's not always easy to tell them apart . Like Pip , Stewart has great expectations , not merely of swimming magnificent races in Barcelona this summer , but of someday going on to a life in politics or business . // For now swimming is his priority . In March , at the U.S. Olympic trials in Indianapolis , Stewart set himself up for a very busy Olympics , making the team in the 100 and 200 flies and the 800-freestyle relay . If he beats teammate Pablo Morales in the 100 fly in Barcelona , Stewart will also swim the 400 medley relay . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event in which he stands a good chance of doing something mind-boggling in Barcelona . At last year 's world championships in Perth , he went into the final turn a meter behind ' 88 Olympic champion Michael Gross of Germany , then pulled ahead in the last 50 meters to finish in 1:55.69 , .55 of a second under Gross 's world record . Stewart is the only person to have twice broken 1:56 in the 200 fly . Someone is going to have to improve mightily between now and July 30  --  the day the 200 fly will be swum in Barcelona  --  if Stewart is to have any competition at all . // Growing up in Gastonia and then in Charlotte , Stewart was a bully 's dream . His swimming bag had LITTLE MELVIN written on it , and he would wear his swim-suit as underwear for a week before big races . " When I was 10 , " he says , " I was swimming in a lane with 15- to 18-year-olds . I was a cocky little kid , and I loved to beat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit . But that was all right : I 'd kick their butts in the water . " // His coach at that time was Frankie Bell , and it was she who taught Stewart the side-breathing technique he has used ever since . Two hundred yards , she reasoned , was a long way for a little boy to keep lifting something as heavy as his head . " I really believe it 's a faster way to swim the 200 fly , " says Stewart . " When you 're breathing forward , you lift your head straight up . When you breathe to the side , at a 45-degree angle , there 's no lift . " // Little Melvin was ranked among the nation 's top 10 in his age group in 16 of 21 events that year . In four of them he was first . " Every time I fell into the water , it seemed I set a record , " he says . " It was great . " By the time Stewart was 13 , he had been featured on the P.M. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " My name is Melvin Stewart , and I 'm the best . I 'm going to win Olympic medals . " // " His confidence has always been misunderstood , " says his mother , Myra . " The press says he 's cocky . They do n't know . He 's had to fight for his life . " // She is not referring to Little Melvin 's teenage tormentors but to Jim Bakker , the televangelist who presided over the PTL ministry until 1987 . Bakker was convicted of fraud in ' 89 and sentenced to 18 years in prison . For nine years , from 1978 to ' 87 , Melvin Sr. served as recreation director for the PTL and as athletic director of its school , the Heritage Academy . // For the first five years of Melvin Sr. 's tenure , the family lived in Charlotte . But when Melvin was 14 , they moved to the grounds of PTL 's Heritage USA . " It was like a little fairyland , " Stewart recalls . " Water slides . Hotels . Malls . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fundamentalist Christian who made her son read seven chapters of the Bible each day  --  out loud  --  she never trusted Bakker . " God was never a part of the PTL , " she says firmly , adding that Bakker was " like a vacuum cleaner when it came to money . " She and Melvin Sr. used to baby-sit for the Bakker children , but because of her doubts about Bakker 's ministry , Myra refused to let her children go to Heritage Academy , so Melvin and his older sister Kim attended Fort Mill High . // Melvin 's recollections of Bakker are softer than his mother 's . " He 's got a lot of charm , " he says . But Myra , ever vigilant , thought Bakker was out to brainwash her family . " Jim Bakker kept reaching out for my husband and son , " she says . " All along I knew the man was going to prison . I let his people know in no uncertain terms : You back off my family . " Her son still resents being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like dragging a bag of trash around behind me , " he says . // The one thing Stewart was always devoted to was swimming . " I worked hard , " he says . " Swimming was a release . I had to get away . " // The chance to get farther away came early in Stewart 's junior year at Fort Mill High . Bill Close , a businessman in Fort Mill and a Mercersburg Academy alumnus , had called the prep school in 1984 , to tell officials about the superb young swimmer who lived in his town , and a year later Stewart decided to go . Stewart seemed like a natural for Mercersburg , which had produced 15 Olympic swimmers and under its young coach , John Trembley , 32 , had " won " five mythical national high school championships over the past six years . // The only problem was that the Stewarts could n't afford Mercersburg 's $13,900-a-year tuition . And because the school term was already well under way , the money in Mercersburg 's scholarship fund had already been allocated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Mercersburg headmaster , called George Baxter , a wealthy alumnus , to see if he would be interested in sponsoring Stewart . Baxter set up a scholarship fund for Stewart but did n't get to meet him until after he had been paying Stewart 's bills for a month . " The Baxters took me under their wing , " says Stewart . " They said to me , ' This is how you dress . This is what you do . You 're already a winner . You just do n't know the social graces. ' " // Stewart also did n't know what he was in for academically . Despite the fact that he was repeating his sophomore year because of bad grades , his academic average that first year at Mercersburg was 60 , the lowest passing grade possible . " Most of the time I felt clueless , " he says . He was required to write an extra paper each week and was shocked to find himself spending more time behind his desk than in the pool . // Still , life at prep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first year Stewart was caught in his girlfriend 's dorm wearing only boxer shorts and a smile . " It was 2 a.m. , " he confesses , as if poor timing was his only offense . Yet by the time Stewart graduated in 1988 , he was an honors student and a dorm prefect . And he had jumped up the world rankings in the 200 fly from 33rd to second . " The single greatest thing that 's happened to me was going to Mercersburg , " he says . // " This prep school thing is a bigger deal for him than for anyone else I 've known , " says Roger Jenkins , a dean at the University of Tennessee , who serves as Stewart 's academic adviser . And Baxter has shown Stewart a life-style that Little Melvin never dreamed of . Every fall Stewart visits New York City with Mr. B  --  as he calls Baxter  --  and they stay at the Plaza Hotel ; when he visits Mr. B in West Palm Beach , he stays at the swank Breakers Hotel , If Stewart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you blame him ? " He 's also very goal-oriented , " says Don Bosch , the Knoxville attorney who represents Stewart . " Melvin 's thinking 15 , 20 years down the road . " // At the same time he is impulsively mischievous . Asked in Indianapolis to evaluate the U.S. women 's team , he answered , " It 's probably the greatest women 's team ever assembled . And probably the best-looking , too . I 'm glad to be part of this team in more ways than one . " // If Stewart seems at times to be a bull in the china shop of political correctness , he is a gentle one , a provocateur more playful than mean . Last fall he was having dinner with Betty Bean , a friend and a columnist for the now-defunct Knoxville Journal . When Bean teased him about the number of young women who came over to say hello , Stewart made an observation he has regretted ever since . " Women are like the four food groups , " he said . " You have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stewart forgot about the comment until it appeared in Bean 's column some months later . For the next few weeks the tape on Stewart 's answering machine was filled with irate calls from women friends . " I want to be a politician someday , " Stewart moans . " That 's going to come back to haunt me. " // There is a tug-of-war going on inside Stewart . He swims between adolescent silliness  --  he counts cow-tipping among his hobbies  --  and adult respectability In 1987 he was nominated by the Charlotte Athletic Club as its scholastic athlete of the year , along with two football players . At the club 's black-tie dinner , he stood before an audience that included Michael Jordan 's parents and NBA commissioner David Stern . The other nominees , says Stewart , " thanked God , their mothers and everybody else they could think of . " Stewart made an immodest proposal : " I have a way to increase swimming 's popularity , " he said , and the paused for effect . " What if we swam naked ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hours he spends in a state of virtual sensory deprivation . " Some people thin I 'm not a serious athlete because I go to a press conference and joke and laugh , " he says . " But when you 're out of the pool , it 's time to wind down . That 's why I 've been able to swim so long and enjoy it so much . I genuinely enjoy swimming . That 's kind of crazy in itself . " // The butterfly is the most masochistic of the four strokes . The 200 fly is thus the perfect event for Stewart , for whom hard work possesses an almost spiritual quality . He is contemptuous of shortcuts . // " People in the swimming community are looking for an easy way out , a way to decrease the amount of time they spend in the water , " Stewart says . " But in years to come we 're going to sec athletes doing much more work . You 've got to feel pain every day . " // In this Stewart is far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fly work that most swimmers do , sometimes as much as 8,000 meters in a single workout . Stewart 's work ethic can be traced to his devastating memory of the last Olympics . He went to Seoul with the second-fastest 200 fly and fully expected to win the gold medal . Gross won , in 1:56.94 . Stewart finished fifth , in 1:59.19 . " My stomach felt sick , " he recalls . " I knew it would be the longest time until 1992 . A guy finally had to walk over and tell me to get out of the pool . " // In fact , the time has passed quickly . A year ago , when the NCAA announced it was limiting practice hours to 20 a week , Stewart decided to give up his final year of eligibility at Tennessee . That meant he could start earning money . In the summers of 1990 and ' 91 he lived in Las Vegas and trained with Las Vegas Gold , a swim club promoted by casino owner Bob Stupak , who offered $100,000 to any club @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or U.S. Open . Nobody won the bonus , and Stewart moved back to Knoxville when the desert lost its appeal . Now , besides the $1,500 monthly stipend he receives from U.S. Swimming , he is sponsored by The Finals swimwear company and PowerBar , the nutritional energy bar , and he seems to be prospering . He bought a Porsche in February and owns a two-bedroom condo on the outskirts of Knoxville , which he shares with a roommate , Derek Kennedy . // " Melvin has a strong will , " says Kennedy . " Any desire he has , he puts into action . " There is a ritual that Stewart performs every morning upon awaking . He goes into the kitchen , where a notepad hangs on the refrigerator door . He writes down the time he hopes to swim at his next big meet , reads it aloud , then erases it . " I 'm reminding myself that this is another day in which I 'm taking a step toward being the athlete I want to be , " he says . Stewart wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach , only that it 's under 1:55 . " Swimming for him really is self-expression , " says Kennedy . " Melvin feels joy when he swims . "
