PART I NEW YORK CITY , 1967 I had the kind of looks you knew were going to make money -- one way or the other , sooner or later . Irish American , at a time when Americans were obsessed with the breed . Clear , blue eyes that beamed all the intensity of a wolf on the hunt . A strong nose that anchored a skeptical expression to the face . A moody mouth ; at times , a wounded , sexual look about the lips that seemed to arouse people to a carnivorous interest . A wild , rebellious wave of dark hair . A lean , athletic body , built to slip all holds -- those , that is , not good for compensation . All in all , trouble -- but pretty trouble . I did not want to go to the audition that afternoon . I went because I was tired of lying around the roof , soaking up sun and thinking about sex . I was twenty-three years old and obsessed with aging , while the hot days on the tar beach passed and I showed no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Broadway 's door . The audition was for a comedy that would tour a few dinner theaters in Florida , where the audiences of old folks judged the evening 's merits by the menu and slept through most of the show and where applause came in the form of waves of flatulence wafting in over the footlights . And the play itself would be a stinker , too -- a newly optioned Neil Simon imitation that would lumber back up to Broadway next season and run a week before closing . If a producer had doubts about the commercial possibilities of an untried comedy , it always went south first to earn its keep in the dinner theaters . But it was only June . Another depressing New York City summer had only just begun , and auditions would grind to a halt now until fall . I had to do something . I needed a break from the city . Even Florida would do . And -- who could know ? Maybe I would meet someone down there -- another actor , perhaps -- and maybe the material we had both stooped to perform would blow the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six-week fuck . God knew , it was hard to find anyone among the aspiring theatrical young who would drop the mirror long enough to consider the magnificence of someone such as myself . Actors were fully self-contained , self-adoring masturbators , reluctant to break from their families of fingers -- doubtful that their resources could ever be tapped and appreciated as well by any other hand . And so off I went to the audition -- not to advance myself in the theater but simply to see if I could get my rocks off . The play , as described in Backstage -- the rag we all read to find out what parts were up for grabs -- was obviously designed to be foolproof against empty houses . In fact , it was unabashedly called Something for Everyone ; in his fear of box office failure the playwright had written parts for an orthodox Jew , a Kennedy lookalike ( not the Kennedy or any particular Kennedy , just a Kennedy ; they were all saints back then ) , an English rock musician , a Black Panther , a dumb southern darky , a Chicano grape picker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community who is probably a you-know-what , a " troubled " Catholic priest , a sitar-playing mystic , a " comical and charming " Irish drunk , and an Italian gangster who gives his money away to the poor . This whole crowd -- painfully obviously representing " America "  - -  comes to call on a white , middle-class , politically middle-of-the-road family in Middle America on a Sunday afternoon when Dad is trying to just relax with the kids and watch the football game -- or rather , " the game . " This hilarious premise formed the basis of the plot . It was a mistake to bother going ; within minutes of arriving , I wanted to leave . The audition was held in a midtown office building . It was stiflingly hot in the corridor where the actors waited . I had elected to try for the Kennedyesque character ; unfortunately , from the looks of them , so had most of the others . It was a cattle call -- an audition open to nonunion actors ( which is what I was ) , where the sense of self-worth was all but extinguished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly the same type as yourself and where it became far too apparent that too many of us wanted the same part and wanted it so badly that tensions fairly flowed through sweat glands to stink up the room . I lost it quickly that day . Disgust welled up in me . I was sick of trying , sick of sniffing around and begging for scraps . I should have stayed on the roof and played with myself . And yet I hung in there for over an hour before exploding . Meanwhile , my life -- as a rotten dinner-theater playwright might say -- passed before my tired , twenty-three-year-old yet ancient eyes . Brando had A Streetcar Named Desire for his breakthrough . Dean had East of Eden . Here I was vying for a part in something destined to be flushed down the southern bowl , right into the cultural swamp where pink pedal pushers reigned supreme and the cocktail of choice was made with Geritol and Metamucil , prune in place of olive . Though usually a hornball at auditions , this time I did n't even case the corral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head bowed over my xeroxed portion of the script , my sweat dripping onto the nearly illegible blue print and my heart bleeding for a lost and wasted youth . Seething with claustrophobia , career anxiety , and my ferocious need to get laid , and feeling I could take no more , I looked up from the soaking script and saw , leaning against the wall directly across from me , the perfect focal point for all my steaming rage . It was the way he was reading his script . A slight , blond boy , he had his nose buried in the pages and was reading intently , moving his lips , as though there might actually be something redeemable in there . I found his hopeful earnestness maddening . One long stride across the hall and I was on top of him , my chin jutting across the pages of the script . I looked into startled blue eyes and said through clenched teeth , " You know you 're waiting around here to get consigned to the fucking bone orchards of Florida . Not exactly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all you 'd do this "  - -  and I reared back , ripped my script in two , and tossed it into the air . " You wan na do something intelligent in your sad life ? " I snarled . " Follow me to the Theatre Bar and get drunk . " A minute later I was rushing down Broadway sucking in air like a man with seconds left to live . Even though I hated the taste of booze and drank very little , I was bitter now because I was too poor to get drunk at the bar ; I could afford at most three drinks . I thought about quitting New York and marrying my hometown Connecticut girlfriend , who was studying nursing in Portland , Maine . I wondered whether nursing paid enough to keep me drunk and unemployed for the rest of my life , assured myself that she would never know about the boys I had played with since coming to New York , and reassured myself that I had never taken the boys all that seriously to begin with . Maybe she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got back on my feet and could decide what to do with my life now that I had given up on acting . Some time off was all I needed , a snatch of the century spent in New England . I just had to get out of New York for a spell . Through my gloom , I found to my surprise that I kept seeing that young actor 's startled blue eyes -- no , they were blue green -- still staring at me . Was I mistaken or had those pretty eyes shown a sort of flash of recognition , as though happy to see me , once the shock of my verbal assault and maniacal behavior had passed ? A few minutes later I was standing in the Theatre Bar on Forty-fifth Street sipping a whiskey sour . Five minutes after I arrived , the blond walked in , and I knew he had answered the call of the same thumping vibration that had been beating in me throughout my thoughts of an early New England retirement . He joined me at the bar as casually as though this date had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long time . KEY WEST , 1997 The best part of life in the sixties was the fucking . Or more precisely , the fact that it could happen in such a flash , between two people who had just met . The long-contained American libido seemed to have blown its lid and boiled over ; it was n't cool to hold back . But the blond young actor who walked into the bar that afternoon was most definitely not a creature of the times , and although we did manage to have some raunchy fun later on that evening , we still had to contend with a country girl named Eunice . I am still contending with her thirty years later . Indeed , if not for her , I would not be writing this bloody and romantic account . The boy 's name was Hank Carter . Eunice had grown up with him and had come with him from the cornfields of Indiana to New York , as a fellow aspiring actor and as his lover . Soon after I arrived on the scene to claim him for my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard from her again until earlier this year , when she called my home in Key West to tell me Hank was dead , and that she needed my help . She headed the theater department of a small college in Indiana and wanted me to contribute to an audio history she was making for the school 's library about people from the area who had made their way -- or tried to -- to Broadway . She told me she was pursuing the project both in the interests of theater history and as part of an effort to set up a fund to provide financial aid to young actors who wanted to go to New York . That Hank never got anywhere did n't matter , she said -- it was his " attempt , " the guts it took to take on New York ; if the Hoosiers knew how difficult it was to switch playgrounds from the corn belt to Times Square , maybe they would cough up some dollars to help their homegrown talent . Letters went back and forth between Eunice and me and continue to do so to this day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audio I would make , but we both got so caught up in the memories that soon we were involved in nothing less than a full-scale investigation of Hank 's life in New York . All the material we came up with could never fit onto an audio of the length she had in mind . We were corresponding out of a fascination with filling in the gaps . We knew different parts of Hank 's story , and it seemed to me , as the letters shot back and forth , that the original goal of a memorial to Hank in the school 's library was becoming beside the point . A competition had developed between us . The winner would be the lover who could show evidence of the strongest influence on Hank 's life . Now , Eunice does n't know it -- demure whore that I am -- but I have made a considerable amount of money in my life by way of sexual talent . This was quite some time ago , of course -- but I used to specialize in prying secrets from reticent clients . And although I had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involvement with Hank , you would think I would have been a most intuitive boyfriend . Yet , thirty years later , I take up the pink pages of Eunice 's letters to discover that through sixteen months of fucking the only human being I ever loved , I never even came close to knowing him . At least it feels that way . A hole has been blown through the romantic pension that was supposed to support a lifelong cynic in his retirement . This thing I am writing runs alongside the Eunice correspondence . It is comprised of the facts I will not share with her . Certainly these pages will never find their way to Hank 's slab at the college . I write to remember what it turns out I never understood -- and to come to grips with Eunice 's claim of precedence over me in Hank 's life . I live these days parceling out memories of Hank : some for Eunice -- mostly showbiz bullshit -- and the rest in an effort to probe more deeply into Hank than at any of those times when I thought I had filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secrets he harbored . I realize now that he always slipped out from beneath me with his secrets intact . And even with new information coming in from Eunice , he will continue to elude me . Imagine . Hank is dead , and yet his spirit is turning out to be a bigger cocktease than the living man ever was . A man out of step with his times , perhaps , but not with Broadway 's time , which lagged behind what was happening on the streets . Hank bounced into the bar wearing a white and light blue-striped sports jacket of the sort I associated with old-time vaudevillians , a white shirt , a red bow tie , white pants , white shoes , and a straw boater hat . As I stood at the bar in my T-shirt and jeans , I wondered how he had avoided the sixties with such corny flair . He was around my age ( he turned out to be a year younger ) , the country was going up in flames , and he was dressed for a state fair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white teeth . He took the boater off , put it on the bar , and said in the flat , accentless accent of the Midwest , " I thought maybe Florida would be way too hot for the summer . Besides , the script was no Barefoot in the Park . " " Barefoot in the Park is a piece of shit , " I answered . A hurt look came into the shallow seas of his small blue-green eyes . Charlie Brown . He looked so light ; there was hardly enough of him to be missed after he exited a room . Very thin , medium height . Soft-textured , thinnish blond hair that seemed to hold no long-term lease on his smallish head . A straight , unremarkable nose -- without bump or lump to hook the eye . A blond face , with prepubescent features and mobility . Peter Pan . Too cute to be anything but elf or queer . " Hey ! Take it easy ! I did n't come here to get into a brawl , " he grinned . " I shoulda known , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beckett ? Albee ? " He was making me angry . He was commercial and I was n't . I glared at him . " Hello Dolly , right ? Oklahoma ? " This time he was not the least bit put off . Still beaming , he said , " Oh I love Hello Dolly ! I saw it with Carol Channing . " " Jesus ! She looks like she was created in a fucking laboratory . One of these nights her screws are gon na break loose and she 's gon na disassemble right there on stage . Arms 'll fall off . Plastic snatch 'll drop right outta her dress . " He had ordered a stein of beer and was now guzzling it while I sipped my whiskey sour , and even in my irritability I felt myself get turned on in a mean sort of way . After he took a slug of beer , I gazed at his wet lower lip and figured him to give a great blow job . At that age in my life I still associated love , romance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could see was sex . Blow jobs , and would they take it up the ass . He wiped the foam from his mouth while I tried not to watch like a vulture . Sounding a bit unsure of himself , he said , " Well , you got ta admit the score is great . That 's for sure . You ca n't knock the music . " " The tunes were shit . They all sounded like stuff I 've been hearing all my life . Real music to me is , like , Sergeant Pepper . " " Oh , no . You really like that junk ? " he said , looking almost hurt again . " Anyway , we 're talking about musical plays . " " Put Sergeant Pepper on , " I said , " and in your head you see a play . " " I hate the Beatles . I do n't think they make any sense . " " Take a look around at what 's happening and they make sense . Hello Dolly 's a fantasy . " He sighed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the beer back and left by this time . " Let 's get off musicals , " he said . " If you could play any part in any play on Broadway , what would you choose ? " " Nothin ' . There 's nothin ' to be in . American drama 's dead . " He was beginning to look concerned for my sanity . " Then what .... Why did you go to that audition today ? " " Oh , I still go through the motions . Nothin ' else to do . What about you ? What part would you like to play in the wasteland ? " If he was , to my eye , a bit bland , in reaction to my question he became pretty . The little features seemed to lift and the green of his eyes shimmered happily ( while I speculated that they went dark blue during sex ) . He actually shuffled his feet in a little dance . " Oh man , that 's easy , " he said . " I 'd do Bobby Morse 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the scenery in that one ! " " I do n't think so . You 're not right for it . You 're too passive . " The cartoon look again ; it seemed to say he never should have gotten out of bed today . He retreated into his mug , and I ordered another whiskey sour -- somewhat embarrassedly , because my part in this game called for something more like a shot and a beer . There was beer foam on his lips again , and before he could wipe it off , a playful smile burst through . " Come over for dinner tonight , " he said . " I need my roommate Eunice 's help against you . She 's musical comedy too . She 'll take you on . " " Why would you wan na take an insulting stranger home to dinner ? " I asked . " This is New York , kid . I just might carve you and Linus into little pieces . " " Eunice . Her name is Eunice and you 're not gon na carve anyone up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 'll be fun . " " Eunice your girlfriend ? " " Welllll , kind of , I guess , " he said reluctantly . " We went to high school together in Terre Haute , but she 's really from the boonies . I like her a lot , but sometimes I think it was a mistake to start sleeping together . I mean , for me it was just fun but I think she may have taken it seriously . But I think she 's on the verge of going home . She 's really discouraged about making it in New York . " All these buts . He wanted me to ignore the sleeping arrangement . He looked uncertain , and then his eyes left my face to wander around the room . Though he tried to sound nonchalant , I thought he looked nervous as he said , " You got a girl ? " " Once a month I do . She goes to nursing school in Portland , Maine . Comes down to see me . " I had to suppress a smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Somehow the relationship seems off . I should end it . " He could n't look at me . His eyes now traveled the ceiling . " So you live alone ? " " Right . " " Must be nice in a way . That kind of freedom . Living alone . " Having made a full inspection of the ceiling , he now seemed to be taking an inventory of all the bottles on the shelves . He was so obvious . We were doing a movie scene , and to match his antics , I did a slow fish of my pockets to find a stick of gum , then very meticulously stripped off the wrapper as I casually asked , " Freedom to do what ? " His eyes hit the floor at my feet . " Oh , I do n't know . Explore life ? " Memory . As I focus , that first night thirty years ago floats like a developing photograph in the pan of my brain . A solution of passion and pain oozes images into being . Walking behind him up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street near Riverside Drive . Jacket slung over his shoulder like a curtain soon to be raised . A small , buoyant , insouciant ass . A melon to be munched . With but one troubling question : Would I have to work overtime -- work a threesome -- just to score the melon ? Through the apartment door , into a dark little hall . I make a graceful entrance -- tripping on the police lock , an ugly iron bar wedged between a slot in the floor and the lock on the door ; a booby trap to embarrass the intruder should it fail to keep him out . To break my lurch forward and restore my balance , my hands land on Hank 's back . Such delicate bones -- such thin armor against the world 's assaults . It would take nothing to squash the life out of him . Or , on the other hand , to bend his light frame into all sorts of amorous positions . He went into the bedroom to change and came out in loose , worn jeans , a baggy sweatshirt , and white athletic socks . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had bought a cheap bottle of rye and one of whiskey sour mix . We sat across from each other in the small living room , drinking , and could think of nothing to say . I got nervous : maybe I had made a mistake . He had never been thinking what I 'd been thinking . And any minute , the little woman would be joining us . I silently analyzed all the conversation thus far ; not one concrete word pointed to a definite fuck . Then the little woman did arrive -- most emphatically : tripping on the police bar even more flamboyantly than I had , dropping two bagfuls of groceries as she crashed to the floor , and sending fruits , vegetables , and cans rolling in all directions . Our introductions were carried out on our hands and knees as I helped retrieve the stuff . Hank did n't bother to help , as though he had seen Eunice perform this stunt so many times , he hardly noticed anymore . The face I confronted , there on the floor , was like the punchline to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long nose , a big , grinning mouth crowded with large , slightly bucked teeth -- all the features busily overplaying the comic reaction to the pratfall ; a big tangle of frizzy auburn hair crowning the effect . Not Carol Burnett , exactly , but a part Burnett might play -- a member of the same tribe . Less comic -- if just as fit for slapstick -- was her slim but full-breasted , twenty-two-year-old body -- a dancer 's body , really . Only the big , sad , brown eyes seemed not to fit . But Eunice did in fact want to be a comedienne , I was told later -- and as I watched her play the clown , I estimated that in this circus , no clown would be a match for me , the tiger hungering after Hank . " Wellll , hiiiiii ! " she shrieked . " Compneeee ! How 're yoooo ? Whiskeeeeee ! Ah smell hootch on your breath . What all we celebratin ' ? Ah got spaghetti if you can fetch it out from under that table over there . We can just have us a big ol ' vat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 's your friend 's name ? He looks too shy to speak up . " Actually , I was busy trying to figure out why a girl from Indiana was talking in this travesty of a southern accent . " Tom . Tom Clifden , " I finally said , already picturing her later , clutching my cock as though it hung from a prize-winning bull and shrieking happily , " Golleeee ! What a honker ! " Just how much her act was an act only became apparent when she first called me on the phone not so long ago , and I heard the voice of a sophisticated , cultivated woman . I was n't really surprised : I could remember , way back when we had confronted each other there on the floor , as zany as she was , there had been a brief moment when my scrutinizing gaze was fixed on her , and she returned an equally penetrating , knowing look , probing me like a jeweler inspecting a gem for flaws . Indeed , it occurred to me right there that she knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later we were all drunk . Eunice sat with Hank on a love seat . She had changed from the dress in which she had come home earlier from her office temp job into clothes much the same as Hank 's . She talked about the glory of the Broadway musical , and I shot down everything she said . Hank would hop from the love seat , turn to face Eunice , and agree with everything she had said while I watched him pop out his ass toward me , hands plunged into pockets , shifting weight from foot to foot . He was a sexual politician . A few drinks and rounds of theater sparring later , in response to another of my provocations , Eunice , in one furious motion , sprang from the love seat and landed standing a foot in front of my chair , her eyes blazing vengefully at the poacher who had invaded her coop . " You make everything that ever played on Broadway sound like it 's for idiots , " she hissed . " You think anyone who loves musicals is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't love the theater like me and Hank -- so , just , quit ! Why do n't you just haul yourself out of New York if you think we 're all such dopes ? Just get the hell out and leave the rest of us here to do what we love to do ! " She spun around and bolted to the bathroom , slamming the door behind her . I was impressed . I sat there running my hands through my hair as though it had been singed by her fury . Hank stood staring toward the bathroom door , looking worried . " She 's having a bad time , " he said . " You know . New York . How tough it is . " But then -- as though suddenly deciding Eunice 's absence from the room was an opportunity not to be wasted -- he rushed to a bookcase , rifled through some record albums on the bottom shelf , pulled one out , and held it up . " Wan na see what I did in class yesterday ? " he asked , drunk and excited . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yeah , sure . I guess so . " I wondered a little nervously if Eunice might not get a trifle miffed , after the effort she had put into her big , dramatic scene , to hear an interlude of musical entertainment . Maybe her next scene would include a lunge at my head with a pitchfork or something . But Hank was up for a performance . Much later on he would tell me that he had not done the West Side Story song in class at all . He had just been afraid after Eunice 's outburst that I might leave out of fear of her lunacy , and so he had chosen to sing " Something 's Coming , " which is about a young man 's anticipation of forthcoming romance . He sang along with the cast album in quite a nice baritone , choreographing the number in West Side Story tough-guy style -- crouching , bobbing , and retreating like a boxer or street fighter . I wondered what Eunice could be thinking inside the bathroom while her boyfriend sang to his new friend , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... c'm on , deliver to me ... " I soon forgot about Eunice . I was hooked as I watched Hank slide so totally into the part of a young man on the prowl , aroused and full of expectancy as he looked into my eyes . " Who knows ? Could be . Maybe tonight . " And while I was mainly just horny for him , what he did to me sexually got all mixed together with the glow he exuded in his love of performance , which brought out the sadness I felt about my theatrical ambitions ; and in some odd alchemy , I began to fall in love with him . The joy I saw in his face while he performed his number was exactly what I needed to feel in order to get back in the theatrical race . I felt depressed and cynical at the age of twenty-three because I considered serious drama to be dead on Broadway . Beneath the cynicism , however , I longed for a world of creative excitement that had faded away before I even arrived in New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even on the current fare 's terms , but I just could n't dredge up the drive . But to have someone like Hank for a lover -- to borrow a piece of his drive , his will -- to join my own spirit with his and be transformed -- suddenly seemed the blindingly clear answer to the gnawing question of why I even bothered to stay in New York . Me watching Hank sing and dance -- that goes into the audio . Laughingly reminding Eunice of her girlish tantrum is part of our bullshit correspondence about the old days . What I was thinking through it all is strictly for these pages . There was a cruel end to that night , but Eunice does not tell me that . I do n't know what she was thinking when I looked up to find her leaning back against the wall near the bathroom after Hank 's performance . I was thinking that Hank was mine now -- that she was out of it . And I thought she knew the way it was . The hostility had drained from her face , replaced by a vague look of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should n't go home , that I should sleep on the couch . Not that I interpreted her invitation to stay as a magnanimous gesture made in defeat . I wanted to take Hank out of there and haul him back to my cheap little furnished room . I did n't like it that he would sleep with Eunice , even though , as far as I was concerned , it was for damn sure it would never happen again . Lying there on the couch with all the lights in the apartment off and no sounds coming from the bedroom , I was full of spite and anger . I had glimpsed love for a boy just minutes before , and I had never expected that to happen . I heard myself reverting to my former view of sex with boys as adolescent hijinks . I felt like a redneck stuck inside a prep school full of sissies . I replayed his performance in my mind and with it came a full hard-on . And would n't you know that the very moment the high tide of desire lifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit the bathroom . Watching his underwear-clad figure tip-toeing by just a few feet away now aroused something else -- my sense of fun . Ribald fun , to be sure . I thought -- in a salaciously slurring voice a la Mae West -- Well , hmmmmmm , lemme see here ... first he invites me , with all that bendin ' over to get a look at his butt , then he hauls it off to Eunice 's room . Not fair ... not fair at all . Still in my jeans and T-shirt , I undid my pants enough to expose what I hoped Hank could not pass up , gripped it with my hand , and feigned sleep . Just a guy having an erotic dream . He came out of the bathroom and paused on his way back to the bedroom . Watching him through nearly closed eyes , I stretched , arched my back , and moaned in the throes of my dirty dream . But my performance -- in a sense the coda to his earlier one -- had hardly ( so to speak ) begun when Hank was back inside the bedroom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literal climax : excited by the view of his briefs bulging with a half-erection and his small , full ass , and believing he had gone to the bathroom not to piss but to jerk off -- to visions of me , of course -- my fingers began tapping my flute , bringing forth , presently , a staccato string of milky notes that fell melodiously between my hardened nipples . The pleasure of release was short-lived . Within minutes , I was aching for Hank to come back out of the bedroom . I felt as though Hank and I were horny prison inmates , kept in our separate cages by the guard -- Eunice . In fact , here were the three of us in one apartment , and each of us in turn found himself or herself alone : Eunice , leaning against the wall outside the bathroom after Hank 's song , probably contemplating losing him to me ; me , winding up alone on the couch ; Hank alone in the bathroom . Yet Eunice had somehow seemed the one most in possession of herself . The one least alone .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
