Cristoforo could hear the moaning from steerage , the Chasids were chanting again , moaning and raving in their strange and steeped tongue , the sounds of the Hebrew emerging cloudily from the deck of the Pinta , filling him with some mixture of dread and regard , religiosity and hope , the swells and pitching of the barren seas reminding him of the essential perilousness of his journey . Images of spices , fragrant bouquets from the sullen and mysterious East rose in his nostrils , taunting thoughts of the new and deadly continent opening up before him possessed him with a kind of graciousness . The sounds of the Chasids were overwhelming . Sometimes they would pray for hours , unstopping , one choir beginning when another paused , filling the moist air with imprecations and song , at other times they were silent , pitching and rolling in the deck , the queasiness of their condition doubtless the origin of this strange and necessary silence . Cristoforo did not understand any of it . <p> Of course the Chasids were not to understand , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " They are none of your concern , " she had said . " They are being deported , will keep to themselves under guard , will pray and rave in their strange way but have nothing to do with your journey . " The excitable Queen had gazed at him , her eyes full and penetrating in the darkness . There was something very special between her and Cristoforo ; that had been his intimation from the start but of course under Ferdinand 's cruel gaze and with the happenstance of the Inquisition , it was impossible to bring this strange and stunned accord to any kind of realization . Cristoforo was a man of his time , his mind was seized by the fragrance of spices , dreams of India , dreams of fervent Indians clustering about him , proffering their strange and wistful aphrodisiacs , their eyes round with promise . But with all of that , with thoughts of aphrodisiacs and Indians , his imagination soared clear and pristine beyond this , somewhere far beyond fantasy . He had an assignment ; the Chasids were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deck , swaying , finding purchase on the thin and decaying boards of this wretched ship which was , his great friend Isabella had insisted , the very best available , Cristoforo pondered his fate , considered his condition , swung keen and penetrating gaze toward India , the New World , the mysterious aphrodisiac land tucked beyond the dip of the great horizon . Santa Maria , Cristoforo murmured and did not know if he was invoking that mother of passage or repeating the name of his third and most eccentric ship , filled with roustabouts and assassins also deported , a gang so cruel that he had taken Ferdinand 's instruction not to deal with that ship at all , even in his capacity as overseer . " You will be much better , my son , " Ferdinand had said kindly , " staying with your crew and examining the route to India with compass and disjunction , allowing the guards to control that hostile ship . " Cristoforo had shrugged . Who was he to argue with Ferdinand ? A king 's reputation stood between him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but all proportion was necessary within the arc of condition . Sometimes his thoughts were metaphysical , sometimes they were practical , and at all times the three ships rolled and sculled their way toward India , henceforth to be known in his heart only as that aphrodisiacal New World . Abolish all desire , he thought , and the spices of desire would someday be his . His ? All of theirs , then . <p> Excuse me , Master , his yeoman said , approaching with suitable humility . Everyone knew of Cristoforo 's special relationship with Isabella , also of his temper and the secret instructions from the queen which rumored the right to scuttle any who displeased . Behind lay the Inquisition , of course , only for Jews so far but who could indeed tell ? Ahead lay the equally imponderable New World , but somewhere in the middle , Cristoforo presided and his word was terrible , his authority absolute . <p> The rabbi has requested permission to speak to you . He asked me to carry this message- <p> Rabbi ? What rabbi ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself to the possession of a steerage filled not only with chanting but with hierarchy ; there was a leader or several leaders of the Chasids , yes , and they obtained not only the spiritual but the temporal title rebbe , corrupted by the idiomatic language of his day to this less forbidding form . Jesus had been rebbe too , Cristoforo noted . Cristoforo was no longer a religious man , no longer possessed by any vision other than the spicy and nefarious East toward which they so perilously cruised , but he recalled from his childhood pictures of the bearded Master who had of course emerged from the Pharisees of his day and had been put to torture and death for daring to rival them in popularity . Or was that the story ? He was not sure ; the Inquisition of course was a final settling of accounts for this ancient injustice , but Cristoforo , concerned with matters of the sea as well as certain entanglements on shore which even before Isabella had made his life colorful and difficult , had not paid much attention to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have brought the rabbi to the deck . He is over there , demanding to see you- <p> Cristoforo shrugged . A shrug seemed to possess him head to toe , front to back , through all the specious and yet solid aspects of his frame ; he had been shrugging , he sometimes thought , all his life . Shrug for the mean-spirited Barcelona of his day which seemed obsessed with questions of reparation which could not concern a simple Master of the seas . A shrug for Isabella who , after all , was beyond him for all of her flirtatiousness and desirability and would have made much trouble in the possession , a trouble which he suspected she would have found no less titillating than the specter of his murder . Shrug for the Santa Maria and its decks full of felons who would be the first to grapple with the savages of the New Land if the savages were to show any hostile intention . Shrug for the jewels and fragrances which Ferdinand had promised him if he were successful on this difficult mission . Shrug for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world with a certain calculated indifference and ignore the screams and concerns of the Inquisition which after all had absolutely nothing to do with him and which would go on its tortuous way whether or not he was present . So bring him here , Cristoforo said . Let me discuss with you later the proper way to deal below deck , do you hear me ? <p> Whatever you say , Master , the yeoman said and gestured . The rabbi , a huge bearded man wrapped in the vestments of his calling  --  but they all seemed to wear this strange and elaborate garb  --  shuffled toward him downcast , his eyes seeking the deck , then his head tilting upward , the strange , luminous Israelite eyes locking with Cristoforo 's in a way which induced strange sensations , perhaps due to the odors of steerage wafting from the rabbi and vague screams across the water which might have been emanating from the Nina , just barely visible , or the more distant Santa Maria which Jesus Christo he could not and would not want to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to the Jew as the yeoman backed away , submission in all of his posture  --  if nothing else he had established deference in this crew , he had the weight of royalty behind him and there were rumored special and terrible arrangements which the king could visit even at a distance upon mutineers , spies among the crew  --  tell me what brings you above deck ? Yes , what do you want ? <p> The Jew still staring at him in that curious and affecting way said , My name is Solomon . Schelemo , I come to ask , you a favor- <p> I am not interested in your name , Cristoforo said . Your names , frankly , mean nothing to me . <p> Yes , but- <p> If I wanted to establish special relations with Jews , Cristoforo said , it would not be through the medium of names . I would request your presence in other ways . You are here , below the decks , on sufferance , through the mercy of Isabella and Ferdinand , our king and queen . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am simply under orders . <p> That is understood , the Jew said . The conditions below are impossible . There are five hundred and fifty-two of us and we are fainting ; we are placed one upon another in tight racks and without fresh air , without even the possibility of air . There is much fainting and illness . <p> This is not my account , Cristoforo said . Conditions are difficult for all of us . This is a voyage of privation . <p> I beg of you , Solomon said . Permit us to come above decks . Not all together but ten or twenty at a time , just to relieve ourselves of this torment , to take the air , to move- <p> Conditions are worse on the Santa Maria , Cristoforo said . It is a slave ship , filled with the darkest felons of our time . But they do not complain . They drift upon the waters to the New World uncomplainingly and they hold against the day . <p> I know nothing of that , Solomon said . I know only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the disease will begin , then the slow and terrible wasting of flesh  --  even our most fervent prayers will go unanswered- <p> Cristoforo shrugged . Another shrug . Shrug at this , turn away from that , consider the Marins who it was rumored had renounced their Judaism to live in secret and had thus evaded the eye of the Inquisition while seeking remission in other ways . Cristoforo knew plenty about that . Shrug at the sea , shrug at the New World itself . If it had been left to him he would have been a merchant at the Port of Barcelona and would have left conditions such as these to the more intrepid . How did this happen to him ? How had he become the Master of such a rude voyage ? It was all that Cristoforo could do not to reach out and shake the rabbi , explain that there were many in agony here and that agony was not now only a matter of steerage . But he said nothing , of course . The loneliness and fervency of command . <p> I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You will have to do what you can down there . It is so decreed . The conditions were made quite explicit to me ; surely the same was done for you . <p> But how long ? Solomon said . How long will this voyage be ? <p> Another shrug . Shrug at distance , at lust , at all the complications of empire and design . I ca n't answer that , Cristoforo said . It could be weeks , it could be a matter of days . We have been at sea for almost a month and we are in uncharted waters . When the New World looms over the horizon and not before then the journey will end . The rest is in hands we can not understand . Surely you know of imponderables , of fate . <p> I know of nothing , Solomon said . You misjudge us , all of us , clearly . We are not cattle ; we are as you and we are suffering . Men , women , and little children , some with pets smuggled aboard , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grace . Do you understand any of this ? <p> You are to return below deck at once , Cristoforo said , the dark lash of anger trailing through his bowels . Now , before this continues . You are insolent and you are exceeding my patience . You were taken aboard by measure of the queen 's generosity and because she took a sudden and unaccustomed pity upon you . I know of nothing else . <p> They cry , Solomon said . They pray and in their prayers is their spirit and their torment . He gestured . Ca n't you hear ? Indeed the keening of the Jews to which Cristoforo had accommodated himself as he had to the stunning curvature of the water struck him suddenly , rose up within him now with the urgency if not the fragrance of those spices he sought . Words seemed to emerge dimly from the groans of insistence , then subsided . Adonai , the Jews cried , Elohim . Brich hu omen . <p> O countrymen , Solomon said , my countrymen , my brother- <p> Enough , Cristoforo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to signal that the interview was over , that the petition had been reviewed and denied , that no less than Torquemada he had been forced to obduracy as a means of containing these people . Behind him he could hear grunts , then whimpers as if Solomon were planning some desperate final assault . Cristoforo shook his head , folded his arms , stared grimly at the sea which heaved from its greenish depths the small mysteries of flotsam , small pieces of debris which assumed vaguely organic shape , then were swallowed by the water . V'yisgadal . Shmeh rabo . The small and diminished sound of Solomon pattering away from him and then the chants rising from the spaces of Neptune , mingling with the sounds of the sea itself , swaddling Cristoforo in the dangerous and terrible sounds which signaled the slow turning of the Earth , the emergence of the New World to the starboard . <p> In the distance Cristoforo imagined that he could see mountains , could glimpse the tread of elephant , could see the bangles of princes as they contended with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he knew the signs of delirium when from a great distance he let it signal him . He was a man of the sea . Cristoforo shrugged again , shrug for the Jews , for Torquemada 's insistence , for Torquemada 's descent . Shrug for the New World , shrug for the troubles and purchase of five hundred Jews below deck whom he would never see , could never grasp . More was to be done and later . He felt his body lighten as a sense of decision came upon him . This would only last to a certain point , then there would be another circumstance . He was sure of it . Shrug and step , step and shrug , a sudden disturbing intimation of Isabella 's swollen and needful breast prodding at him as he signaled the yeoman to take over , however momentarily , the helm . <p> On the Santa Maria , Torquemada , enthused , gathered the desperadoes around him . Garbed as they , indistinguishable from them , far departed from the priestly robes of his magnificence , he had become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working . The cunning and ingenious plan , worked out in the most sacred places of the Church and then with the king and queen was working . <p> Oh listen to me , Torquemada said . Oh listen friends and companions . They gathered around him , the most desperate men of Spain , men so desperate that on this voyage of desperation they had been segregated . Only Torquemada could control them , could understand and apprehend their spirit and it was for this reason , to test himself , that he had embarked upon this exile . Behind him the Jews who soon enough would be encountered . The New World beckons , Torquemada said , a place of justice , light , and peace . Attend to it ! Can you not see it ? Unshaven and desperate heads turned , gleaning the new land through the spume of the sea . Here we will begin afresh , Torquemada said . That was the plan , the plan for all of us . They murmured in response . Here , Torquemada said , we will take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , depart then for new and better shores . But you must keep your courage up . Must not fail . <p> Kill them , one of the men said . We should go back to the Master 's ship and kill them now . <p> Torquemada smiled , thinking of how far he had taken them , how far all of them had come in this one sharp , difficult month of voyage . Not just yet , he said . It must be at the right time for the right purpose . Now it would be just slaughter . There was enough slaughter in Spain , here it will be of a different kind . We will seed the ground , Torquemada said . We will expend their blood in the purposes of consecration and it will be better . <p> You talk like a priest , one of them said . Are you a priest , then ? Or are you one of us . <p> I am one of this and one of the other , Torquemada said . I make faith with you in these spaces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the tablelands of the New World will be upon us and we will turn them holy under the gush of sacrificial blood . But for now , he said , for now we must once again pray . We must place our knives and ordnance in protected places and pray for a good conclusion to this voyage . Do you hear me ? Ave Maria , Torquemada said , and continued with the familiar litany . They settled in with him , attentive as scholars to the rhythm of his words . I had no choice , Torquemada thought , looking at the high plumes of the water , the sails glinting against the turbulence . It was difficult but the only means to carry forth the Inquisition . One must constantly move outward in order to move inward . We had accomplished our sacred purposes in Madrid , Barcelona had become ours as well ; soon it would have turned within and by losing everything we would have gone beyond risk . But here , here , by transporting the Jews , by moving forth even as we move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibilities of all . <p> Or am I not sanctified ? he thought , a man of doubt as well as of faith , just as the honored Saviour himself had been . Is it this or that ? Is it one thing or the other ? Is that shipful of Jews headed for the Jerusalem of the spirit which we will erect or , aligned in the sign of the cross , will they perish at the bottom of the seas ? In Cristoforo 's hands , he thought , but fortunately I can attend to the matters of transcendence , leave the temporal in the hands of Cristoforo . Thy will be done , Torquemada said . They looked at him intently . He raised his hands in the gesture of submission , feeling the terrible power of the waters underneath . <p> In the racks , Solomon said , I did the best I can . I pleaded with him . I asked for air and light . <p> But he said no , the three Davids said . He said no , the Israelites said . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wiping the foreheads of the children who clustered . He refused . <p> That is right , Solomon said . He refused . He said that we were steerage , garbage , at the behest of the queen but of no concern to him . I told him that we would die and he turned away . There is nothing to be done . <p> Cristoforo is not a man of mercy , Judith said . He cares nothing for any of us . <p> That is not so , Solomon said . He is doing what he must , just as we are . He is in the control of larger forces . At least we are on the seas . We have been spared the Inquisition . Maybe it will be different for those of us who live . If they live . If we live . This damnable voyage- <p> Spared the Inquisition , Ruth said , taking Solomon 's hand , but not the Inquisitor . The Inquisitor is always with us . He comes in the night , he follows on the seas , he screams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Nothing to be done , Solomon said . We are creatures of their mercy . <p> I tell you , Rachel said , that there is a judgment coming which is beyond all of us . They seek a New World but it is eternally the old . <p> The steerage , silent when Solomon had returned , cast down to silence by hope or at least curiosity , resumed , broken fragments of prayers ascending only to the thin bulkheads which made them crouch against the racks , then dispersed . It will not be long , Solomon said . We can not survive this . We are a shipful of Jews , not of mystics or explorers , and in our flight is our guilt and our culpability . Nevertheless- <p> Nevertheless , Judith said , as if she had taken his thought , pressing his hand , nevertheless we have at least carried ourselves , carried a bit of testimony , moved to some different place through the designs of our own spirit . We are not Marins . We are not apostosaic . Our apostasy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Solomon said , the chanting murmuring about him , the disputation with Judith  --  this woman , to engage not only in prayers but Talmudic disputation with women was their peculiar but necessary fate in these conditions  --  continuing all of their strange and strangely confluent anguish melding as the Pinta inexorably carried them toward a fate which they could not determine , in all faith , in the faith of God , the one God of Israel whose Name was One and whose Oneness was indivisible in the heart of their exile . <p> Torquemada , seized by a sudden spirit of ecstasy and affirmation , struck as if by a bolt from the brow of the Holy Ghost , began to dance and heave upon the deck of the Santa Maria , incognizant of the stares of the felons , indifferent to the risks which this display of ecstasy might bring upon him , the steps of his dance , carrying him from one side of the ship to the other while on the bosom of the ocean the craft lurched and spilled not only its provisions but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> And so , and so they came upon mysterious India then , their New World , the slave ship and the Master 's ship and the ship between , the shipful of Jews and the ship of the Inquisitor , caught their first glimpse then of the New World through the mist and fog of their combined prayers and in that moment , as Torquemada leapt , as the Jews chanted , as a grim and compliant Cristoforo adjusted sextant and compass , shrugged toward this newest part of his destiny , in that moment it was as if all the centuries had expired and this strange and mismatched concatenation of spirit and flesh , voyagers and prisoners , repelled and necessitous were gathered by the bolt which had struck Torquemada and which swept them from the heart of the ocean to the bowels of the ship , then expelled them to the crevices of the millennium itself , myths of purgation and collision hastening their way toward coming apostasies . The shipful of Jews , their captain , their keeper and their Inquisitor joined at last in that voyage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dreamed that he was in the gravity of Isabella herself , her capacious sex absorbing and expelling him as would all the centuries and scholars to come and the spray of his seed upon the ocean of the queen the plume to drag him past myth and toward the first awareness of his destiny . Cristoforo the Jew . Cristoforo the keeper of souls . <p> Reciting Kaddish then : V'yish ka'dash . Shmeh rabbo . <p> All hallowed be the name of our God . <p> Brich hu . <p> Hallowed and sanctified . <p> O-men . <p>
