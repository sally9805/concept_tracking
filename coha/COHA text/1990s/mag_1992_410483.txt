In Thailand coups and other major political battles usually occur when the weather is cool . But this past May , toward the end of a hot season that greatly enhanced Thai fears about global warming , the most dramatic political struggle since 1976 took place . For the better part of the month , the forces of a government headed by General Suchinda Kraprayoon were marshaled against a " pro-democracy " movement led by Chamlong Srimuang , a former general who had served for many years as the governor of Bangkok . On May 18 the army , under orders from Suchinda , opened fire on a massive " pro-democracy " demonstration in Bangkok , killing several hundred protesters . Within a week the country came to the brink of civil war , King Phumipol intervened , and Suchinda was forced to resign . A new caretaker government is in place and new elections have been scheduled . Clearly , a major political battle has taken place . The military , and particularly the faction of the military associated with Suchinda , has suffered a major defeat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a locus of stability and mediation in moments of national crisis . And the " pro-democracy " forces have won an impressive victory . This battle of 1992 is , however , simply one event in a long-term struggle that has its origins in the 19th century . Many basic issues have not yet been resolved , and the process will almost certainly extend well into the 21st century . This long-term struggle that continues to play itself out in these events is intimately associated with the process of modernization . In Thailand this process began in the late 19th and early 20th centuries with the successful effort by the Thai elite to resist colonial intrusion , maintain local autonomy , and establish a nation-state . The process has continued into the late 20th century in the form of a national effort to generate the political , economic and social development that will enable Thailand to participate and compete in a rapidly changing world . At the same time , the struggle has involved from the very beginning an intense and sometimes violent internal competition for control of national political and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watershed event in the Thai struggle with the problems and possibilities of modernization was the coup d'tat of 1932 . Prior to that , virtually all political leadership and control had been centered in the king . Secondarily , this leadership and control was exercised by the members of the aristocratic elite that surrounded the royal court . This leadership had proved to be remarkably effective in advancing the closely related projects of preserving Thai independence and constructing a modern nation-state . But early in the reign of King Prachadipok ( Rama VII , the seventh king in the Chakri dynasty that was established in 1782 ) , a group of military officers and civilian leaders organized a coup that ended the royal and aristocratic monopoly on government policy and power . Once the dust from the coup had settled , the three major " actors " in the bloody drama that played itself out in Bangkok this past May were more or less firmly in place : the weakened monarchy , the military and the civilian elites . From the outset , most of the leaders of the 1932 coup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the institution , in a symbolic and ceremonial form , was needed to provide a primary locus for a revised form of Thai civic religion . Thus after his ability to exercise direct political power was removed , the king was invited to remain as a symbol of the nation 's continuity with its past and as a source of political legitimacy . The decision to retain the monarchy has proved to be a wise one . After a period of instability , the monarchy gained new life in 1957 . A high-ranking member of the military led a successful coup , established his own military regime , and adopted a new policy that involved strong support for King Phumipol and the royal family . Using this government support as a launching pad , Phumipol gradually matured into a very energetic monarch . Through his ceremonial activities , his adept handling of royal finances and his broad-ranging social-welfare commitments , he has greatly enhanced his position and influence . Over the years he has established a very strong rapport with virtually every segment of Thai society . Important as the retention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and identity that it symbolized and encouraged was not sufficient to hold together the military and civilian components of the coup . Already in the mid-1930s the tensions between the two groups had developed into a deep division that has characterized Thai politics ever since . The military has , up to this point , clearly held the edge . It has been the only sector of Thai society sufficiently organized to provide a consistently viable political alternative . What is more , the military services became a locus for upward social mobility . As a result the military acquired considerable grassroots support . The pre-eminence of the military was also aided and abetted by its very strong anticommunist reputation , which mobilized important support within the country and also attracted a significant amount of American aid . The primary opposition to the military has come from a civilian , largely urban middle class that has been closely associated with the university . This civilian elite has consistently sought to establish a less authoritarian , more democratic political process . Though this group has never succeeded in gaining long-term control over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power and influence as the country 's modernization process has proceeded . Events occurred in 1973 which in many respects resemble the most recent developments . At that time widespread discontent with the military government headed by Field Marshal Thanom Kittikachorn touched off a student rebellion that brought Thanom 's regime to its knees . At a crucial moment , after the army had opened fire on the student demonstrators and chaos threatened , King Phumipol intervened . He " requested " that Thanom and his closest associates leave the country , invited a highly respected civilian statesman to head an interim government , and convened a conference of national leaders that adopted a new constitution . Under this constitution a new civilian government was elected , and that government ruled the country for almost three years . However , in this new , more open political environment the students became bolder in their expression of radical views , and farmer and labor unrest broke out across the country . Concern about this agitation and unrest , coupled with communist victories in neighboring Cambodia and Laos , led to a bloody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) returned the country to military rule . Yet another experiment in civilian rule began in 1988 , but this time the transition to a civilian regime was achieved in a very different way . No disillusionment with a military government resulted in a successful rebellion against the generals in power . Quite to the contrary , General Prem Tinsulanonda , the military prime minister who had been in power since 1980 , had quite self-consciously prepared the way for a smooth and peaceful transition . Working with the clear support of the king , Prem and his government had fostered the growth of the civilian middle class through policies encouraging rapid economic development and education . When General Prem retired , the elected parliament calmly chose a civilian prime minister to be his successor . Despite the country 's many serious problems , the character of the process that had led to a civilian government inspired some confidence that , at long last , the country had entered into a new phase of modernizing development . As it turned out , the transition to civilian rule was not permanent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of still another military coup . A segment of the armed forces under the leadership of General Suchinda seized power , ousted the elected government , and established an interim government that was assigned the task of administering the country until a new constitution could be written and approved . Many were dubious about Suchinda 's claim that his purpose was simply to purge the government of corruption . But those who were appointed to the interim government were respected leaders , and there was a promise of a new constitution and new elections . Thus the opposition was largely mute . Between February 1991 and May 1992 the real character of the military junta became clear . Connections between the junta and the brutally corrupt military regime that holds power in Burma became public knowledge . The press publicized connections between members of the junta and questionable business activities . A Buddhist monk protesting logging ventures that were destroying forests in the northeastern part of the country was arrested and jailed . Sulak Sivaraksa , a leading Buddhist activist who spoke out against the regime , was threatened with arrest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitution that was eventually approved was transparently designed to serve the purposes of the military leaders who had engineered the coup . When the promised elections were held , the results were mixed . In Bangkok , 33 of the 36 representatives who were victorious were members of a party that called itself Palang Tham , a name that means Power of Dhamma ( the Buddhist term for sacred law or truth ) . The party was led by Chamlong Srimuang , a politician who was respected for his honesty and was known as a prominent member of a new Buddhist sect that emphasizes Buddhist morality and self-discipline . It was a party that strongly advocated civilian rule . But in the provincial cities and rural areas a strong majority of the representatives elected were members of parties sympathetic to Suchinda and his military junta . Many of these electoral victories were allegedly achieved through fraud , intimidation and the outright purchase of votes . Whatever the truth of that claim , supporters of the junta achieved a parliamentary majority . Once in office , they selected Suchinda as prime minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office a military prime minister who had not been elected to parliament . However , it was a highly controversial move , and provided a galvanizing issue for the " pro-democracy " forces . Under the leadership of Chamlong , nonviolent demonstrations were organized . These demonstrations began in mid-May in the government district of Bangkok , near the Democracy Monument that commemorates the coup of 1932 . As the days went by , the crowd grew more and more massive , and it became evident that the participants included not only students and intellectuals , but large numbers of middle-class and working class adults as well . During the night of May 18 the army opened fire on the protesters and hundreds were killed . Despite the brutality of the army 's response , antigovernment demonstrations continued in Bangkok and began in many of the major provincial centers . Soon after the mass killings took place , army troops that were not supportive of Suchinda and his junta were reported to be gathering north of Bangkok . The nation , it appeared , was on the brink of civil war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually came to suffering that fate . What we do know is that , following an ominous lull during which negotiations were obviously being conducted , it was agreed that Suchinda and Chamlong would appear before the king . When the nationally televised encounter took place , the king was regally seated on a formal chair with the two leaders humbly crouched at his feet . This powerful visual message was supplemented by a short lecture in which the king formally " requested " that the two men reach a compromise that would be in the best interests of the nation . Careful observers noted that retired General Prem was also in the room , signaling his support for the compromise that the king was requesting . Some have suggested that Prem 's presence may also have signaled that the compromise the king had in mind had the support of the elements of the military that were mobilized in the suburbs north of Bangkok . Soon after this highly symbolic television event , the content of the compromise became apparent . General Suchinda resigned , and he and all others who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from prosecution . By June 0 the constitution had been amended to lessen the possibility of military interference in governmental affairs . The king then invited Anand Panyarachun , the respected elder statesman who had served as prime minister during the year following the Suchinda coup , to form an interim cabinet . Anand has taken control of the government and has appointed a cabinet similar to the one he had previously headed . On June 30 the old parliament was dissolved . Anand confirmed that general elections will be held September 13 . Most observers expect that , in response to the May events , the results will reflect a serious decline in the popularity of candidates associated with Suchinda and his military clique . Another military coup remains well within the realm of possibility , but for the moment at least a new experiment in civilian democracy is under way .
