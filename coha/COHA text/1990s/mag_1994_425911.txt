BOOK EXCERPT Why we flee from guilt and the notion of sin . <p> The awareness of sin used to be our Christians hated sin , feared fled from it , grieved over it . Some of our grandparents agonized over their sins ; a man who lost his temper might wonder whether he could still go to Holy Communion . A woman who for years envied her more attractive and intelligent sister might worry that this sin threatened her very salvation . <p> But now the shadow has faded . Nowadays , the accusation you have sinned is often said with a grin and a tone that signals an inside joke . At one time , this accusation still had the power to jolt people . Catholics lined up to confess their sins ; Protestant preachers rose up to confess our sins . And they did it regularly . Their view was that confessing our sin is like taking out the garbage : once is not enough . As a child growing up in the fifties among Western Michigan Calvinists , I think I heard as many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assumption in those days seemed to be that you could not understand either without understanding both . <p> Many American Christians recall sermons in which preachers got visibly angry over a congregation 's sin . When these preachers were in flail cry , they would make red-faced , finger-pointing , second-person plural accusations : " You are sinners  --  filthy , miserable , greasy sinners ! " Occasionally , these homiletical indictments veered awfully dose to the second-person singular . <p> Of course , the old preachers sometimes appeared to forget that their audience included sincere and mature believers . ( You wondered what language they would have saved for Himmler or Stalin ! ) Such preachers were also capable of sounding self-righteous : their own hearts were pure , they wanted you to believe , and even when they were adolescent they yearned much less for sex than for Sunday school . <p> Still , you were never in doubt what these preachers were talking about . They were talking about sin . In today 's group confessionals it is harder to tell . The newer language of Zion fudges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjustment dynamics , and especially our feebleness in networking . " Or , " I 'd just like to share that we just need to target holiness as a growth area . " Where sin is concerned , people mumble now . <p> Why should we speak up ? The reason is that although traditional Christianity is true , its truth saws against the grain of much in contemporary culture and therefore needs constant sharpening . Christianity 's major doctrines need regular restatement so that people may believe them , or believe them anew . <p> But anyone who tries to recover the knowledge of sin these days must overcome long odds . To put it mildly , modern consciousness does not encourage moral reproach ; in particular , it does not encourage self-reproach . Preachers mumble about sin . The other traditional custodians of moral awareness often ignore , trivialize , or evade it . Some of these evasions take time and training . As sociologist James Davison Hunter has observed , schoolteachers no longer say anything as pointed as " Stop it , please ! You 're disturbing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to a strong-armed youth who is rattling classroom windows with his tennis ball , educationally correct teachers put a sequence of caring questions : " What are you doing ? Why are you doing it ? How does doing this make you feel ? " <p> The word sin , Hunter adds , now finds its home mostly on dessert menus . " Peanut Butter Binge " and " Chocolate Decadence " are sinful ; lying is not . The measure for sin is caloric . <p> Recently , however , a few of the older breezes have begun to blow again . In 1990 , a mainline syndicated columnist wondered " Why Nothing Is ' Wrong Anymore . " In 1992 the Vice-President of the United States drew guffaws from talk-show types when he complained that TV 's Murphy Brown made voluntary single parenthood look like merely another lifestyle option  --  and a glamorous one at that  --  but he also drew widespread support from people ( including Newsweek and Atlantic Monthly cover-story writers ) who were otherwise barely tolerant of his quixoticisms . <p> In the summer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series on the Seven Deadly Sins , and MTV produced a special video on the same topic . Though , as John Leo commented in U.S. News &; World Report , the Times pieces were often artsy and arcane , and the MTV production so fragmented and trivial as to suggest that its spokespersons really lacked a vocabulary and frame of reference sturdy enough for the topic , the fact that these sources addressed the topic at all was surprising and newsworthy . <p> The same summer ( July 1993 ) Theology Today devoted a whole issue to serious discussion of sin , including essays on contrition , civil sin , and preaching on sin . Mindful of decades of trivializing where sin is concerned , Thomas G. Long titled his editorial introduction " God Be Merciful to Me , A Miscalculator . " <p> In one of the best known and most widely reproduced editorials on morality in the nineties ( " The Joy of What ? " Dec. 12 , 1991 ) , the Wall Street Journal counted the beads on a string of public sex scandals  --  Anita @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Magic Johnson 's confession that his HIV infection was a by-product of promiscuous sexual athleticism , William Kennedy Smith 's grimy testimony in his Palm Beach rape trial . The Journal then said this : " The United States has a drug problem and a high school sex problem and a welfare problem and an AIDS problem and a rape problem . None of this will go away until more people in positions of responsibility are willing to come forward and explain , in frankly moral terms , that some of the things people do nowadays are wrong . " Remarkably , the Journal strongly implied that it was high time we got the word sin out of mothballs and began to use it again and to mean it . <p> Samuel Johnson said that we need to be reminded much more often than instructed . Sin is no exception . Indeed , for most of us a healthy reminder of our sin and guilt is clarifying and even assuring . For , unlike some other identifications of human trouble , a diagnosis of sin and guilt allows hope . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been done for it . <p> But reminders must be timely . Books on sin today must meet concerns and untie knots that did not worry Augustine and Calvin . They were not worried about the flattening of human majesty in modern naturalism or of human corruption in Enlightenment humanism . They did not wonder at the Californian tendency to conflate salvation and self-esteem . Nor did they meet a widespread cultural assumption that the proper place to inquire about the root causes of human evil is a department of psychology or of sociology . <p> How must the doctrine of sin be taught in settings where pride is no longer viewed with alarm  --  where , in fact , it is sometimes praised and cultivated ? Or where the apostle Paul 's intimidatingly detailed lists of virtues and vices have shrunk to tolerance and intolerance , respectively ? Or where democratic impulses have heightened our sensitivity to sins against inequality but have also invaded spaces formerly reserved for the transcendently holy ? What can the Christian church say about sin in settings where it has itself contributed much to such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My goal , as suggested , is to renew the knowledge of a persistent reality that used to evoke in us fear , hatred , and grief . Many of us have lost this knowledge , and we ought to regret the loss . For slippage in our consciousness of sin , like most fashionable follies , is both pleasant and devastating . Self-deception about our sin is a narcotic , a tranquilizing and disorienting suppression of our spiritual central nervous system . What is devastating about it is that when we lack an ear for wrong notes in our lives , we can not play fight ones or even recognize them in the performances of others . Eventually , we make ourselves religiously so tone deaf that we miss both the exposition and the recapitulation of the main themes God plays in human life . The music of creation and the still greater music of grace whistle fight through our skulls , causing no catch of the breath and leaving no residue . Moral beauty begins to bore us . The idea that the human race needs a Savior sounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of creation and to sharpen our eye for the beauty of grace , we have to know our sin . In the space that remains , let us remind ourselves of one particular category of sin  --  the sins of evasion , the moves we make to avoid God-given responsibilities . <p> FLIGHT <p> <p> The West has finally achieved the rights of man ... but man 's sense of responsibility to God and society has grown dimmer and dimmer .  --  Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn <p> <p> At Yale University in the early 1960s , Stanley Milgram conducted a controversial set of psychological experiments to test human willingness to act harshly on command . He gives us a report in his book Obedience to Authority . What Milgram discovered tells us much  --  much more than is comfortable to know  --  about our readiness to evade responsibility . <p> Through ads in the local paper soliciting volunteers at a generous hourly rate for " a scientific study of memory and learning , " supplemented by a later random mailing , Milgram gathered a diverse pool of subjects . By appointment , these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met the experimenter , a youngish man in a gray laboratory coat , and also a portly , middle-aged man they supposed to be another subject like themselves , but who was actually an actor trained by Milgram . <p> By casting rigged lots , the experimenter arranged in each case for the genuinely naive subject to be the " teacher " in the study and for the actor to be the " learner . " The subject was told that the idea of the experiment was to test the effect of punishment on learning and that , as teacher , his task would be to administer penalty shocks to the learner each rime the learner returned an incorrect answer to one of the test questions . <p> The actor-learner was then strapped into a kind of electric chair and assured in the subject 's presence that though the shocks could be " extremely painful , " they would cause " no permanent tissue damage . " The subject , in turn , was placed before an imposing shock generator said to be connected to the learner . This generator featured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from " 15 volts " to " 450 volts , " with groups of the switches additionally designated as " slight shock , " " moderate shock , " " strong shock , " " intense shock , " up to " danger  --  severe shock , " and , finally , to a simple , ominous " XXX " <p> During the tests , the actor ( who , of course , was actually receiving no shocks at all ) proved to be a most unpromising student . Out of every four questions , he got about three wrong . After each miss , the experimenter instructed the subject to shock the learner with the next highest jolt  --  beginning at 15 volts and moving up through 30 levels to the maximum 450 volts  --  and to announce before each shock the present level of voltage . <p> The actor-learner responded convincingly to this steadily intensifying punishment : he grunted at 75 volts , protested at 120 volts , and demanded at 150 volts to be released from the experiment . At 180 volts the learner cried out " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 270 volts , he emitted what " can only be . described as an agonizing scream . " At 300 volts the learner shouted desperately that he would no longer cooperate by trying to answer questions , and after 330 volts he lapsed into dead silence . <p> Naturally , many subjects found their role in this drama progressively upsetting . Thus , when they turned questioningly to the experimenter , he prodded them , as necessary , with a sequence of increasingly authoritative commands : " Please continue , " then " The experiment requires that you continue , " then " It is absolutely essential that you continue , " and finally , " You have no other choice , you must go on . " <p> Under such pressure , most subjects began to show signs of strain . Some merely blipped the victim for a millisecond instead of really zapping him . Some tried to reduce the strain by such subterfuges as signaling the answer to the victim . Many also dissented verbally from the unexpectedly painful course the experiment was taking  --  while still continuing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of disobedient subjects quit . But obedient subjects reduced their distress by some ploy , maintained loyalty to the experimenter , and kept on buzzing the learner right through his protests . <p> How many obeyed ? Much depended on the proximity of subject and victim . When the learner was in another room and could not be heard except for his urgent pounding on the wall late in the test , 65 percent of the subjects inflicted the harshest punishment . When subjects could hear the victim 's cries , but not see him very well , their compliance dipped slightly to 62 percent . When the victim moved into the same room with the subject who now had to hear the victim 's protests and see his looks of panic and reproach compliance dropped to a still substantial 40 percent . ( Some of the compliant subjects reduced their strain by trying to twist their heads around so that they would not have to see the victim . ) Even when subjects were ordered to force their dull student 's hand down onto the shock plate in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still shocked their victim clear up to 450 volts . <p> Why ? Why would any ordinary person punish an innocent , protesting , screaming , and finally silent stranger in this way ? None of the obedient shockers looked like scrofulous monsters . Most gave little outward indication that they were even particularly aggressive , let alone hostile . A number identified themselves as members in good standing of Christian churches . Virtually all of them , when interviewed , stated their opposition , in principle , to hurting innocent people . Yet , what they rejected in principle they did in practice , however distressed they felt about it . They did it because somebody in a laboratory coat told them that they had no choice . <p> What the Milgram experiments show is that the same pattern of obedience to authority that binds children to parents , pupils to teachers , citizens to police officers , even airline passengers to flight attendants  --  the same pattern on which society depends for order and stability  --  can also transform us into tools of evil . The sobering truth is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reinforce this readiness , decent people will assault innocent strangers on demand and thus evade one of their most basic moral and spiritual responsibilities . <p> What is this responsibility ? In its interpretation of the sixth commandment ( " You shall not kill " ) , the Heidelberg Catechism states not only what the commandment prohibits , but also what it requires : TABLE <p> Of course , the subjects in the Milgram experiments were caught in a bind . They knew as well as anybody that we ought to be friendly to others and protect them from harm as much as we can . In interviews they said they knew this . But they were also in the habit of obeying authority . Moreover , by signing up for the experiment and accepting payment for their role in it , they had implicitly promised to comply with its provisions . And , initially at least , what reason did they have for distrusting these provisions ? Were n't the subjects entitled to assume that a social scientist within the walls of a prestigious university knew what he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space began to fill with the learner 's protests , pleas , and agonizing screams , the subjects also had to face the realization  --  almost unthinkable  --  that they had blundered into the laboratory of a madman and had made themselves his agents . Some quit . Others resolved the conflict by obediently electrifying their neighbor  --  a number of them continuing to defend their compliance even in the postexperiment dehoaxing sessions . <p> Again , why ? In his analysis , Milgram describes what he calls " the agentic state . " A person is likely to shift into the agentic state , says Milgram , every time he enters a hierarchical structure held together by various levels of authority . Once inside the structure , he no longer thinks of himself as a responsible moral subject , but only as an agent of others . He comes to see himself not as a person , but as an instrument ; not as a center of moral responsibility , but as a tool . <p> Moreover , once shifted into an agentic state , he finds it remarkably hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He has too much momentum built up . Shifting into disobedience is at that point like trying to shift a car into reverse at 30 miles per hour . He finds himself bound to a morally deteriorating situation that he wants to abandon , but he can not find a good , dean place to break off . It seems so bumptious to say to a person with a laboratory smock , a clipboard , and the aura of science about him that his experiment is obviously out of control and that it is time to quit . Who can say that ? Who dares to disrupt a well-defined social situation in this way ? <p> Not enough of us . The record of wrongful subservience to authority  --  from Nazi Germany to My Lai to Watergate to everyday life in business and industry  --  is notorious and discouraging . Somebody commands a soldier to shoot civilians through the back of the neck , or a plant foreman to fire a whistleblower , or an attorney to suborn perjury , or a secretary to destroy evidence , and people obey . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do it , but they do it . They then defend themselves with the standard rationalization : " I was only following orders . " " If it were up to me , I would n't do it , but I have to do as I 'm told . " <p> MULTIPLE EVASIONS <p> Shifting into the agentic state is only one way we shirk responsibility . Let 's look at eight other ways , and then consider the most significant of our evasions . <p> 1 . Conforming . In the spring of 1993 , Lakewood , California , a middle-class suburb of Los Angeles , made national news over a scandal surrounding teenage peer pressure and conformity . News sources revealed that a number of Lakewood 's most popular high-school boys had formed a sexual-conquest group ( the " Spur Posse " ) in which members scored a point every time they achieved orgasm with a girl . What disgusted observers was not merely that these young studs competed with each other in this way , or that their scores ranged into the 50s and 60s , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but especially that the members of the Spur Posse were proud of their exploits , that a number of their fathers defended them ( " Nothing my boy did was anything any redblooded American boy would n't do at his age " ) , and that several of their mothers blamed the victims ( " Those girls are trash " ) or threw up their hands in resignation ( " What can you do ? It 's a testosterone thing " ) . Some Lakewood girls felt pressured into having sex with 20 or 25 members of the posse ( especially naive ninth graders who thought that sex with the posse was de rigeur for social acceptance in Lakewood ) . Other social-climbing girls actually sought the notoriety of having " done " the whole posse . After several of the boys had been arrested on various felony charges and then released , they returned to their high-school classes , where class members cheered them . <p> Obeying and conforming are distinct phenomena . As Milgram notes , people obey superiors , but conform to peers . Conformity typically includes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comply with an explicit requirement ; to conform , with an implicit one . Finally , when accounting for our actions ( especially questionable ones ) , we readily acknowledge our obedience , but minimize our conformity . The reason is that we tend to see obedience as a social strength and conformity as an individual weakness . <p> But however we see conformity , we do it , and sometimes to fine effect , as when small-town business-people conform to each other 's high standards of honesty , or when , according to community precedent , almost every able-bodied person assists in a local disaster-relief effort . But suppose our peer group is a mob or a gang . Suppose our peer group is the Spur Posse  --  or their parents , whose casual " boys will be boys " attitude perfectly exemplifies the flight from adult responsibility . Suppose our peer group is Charlie Company at My Lai on March 16 , 1968 . Suppose it is merely a standard congregation of people occupying one of those " pockets of history , " as C. S. Lewis puts it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utter corruption for pardonable imperfection . " All too few of us " dare to be a Daniel " under such circumstances . Peer habits and expectations are too strong : they pressure not only our acts , but also our failures to act . Hence , as experts observe , the existence of " happy families " in which nobody challenges incest or mentions alcoholism , and " groupthink "  --  an eerie phenomenon in which cozy groups of decision-makers . " tacitly conspire to ignore crucial information " on the ground that it does n't fit what the group already assumes . <p> 2 . Conniving . To shut one 's eyes to an injustice , to look the other way , to pretend ignorance of evil  --  to do these things is to connive . We generally think of connivance as a matter of active conspiracy , but it need not be and often is not . Consider the New York Times account of a famous incident . <p> At about 3:20 A.M. on March 13 , 1964 , Kitty Genovese , a 28-year-old manager of a bar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ residential neighborhood , parked her car in a lot adjacent to her apartment building , and began to walk the 30 yards through the lot to her door . Noticing a man at the far end of the lot , she paused . When he started toward her , she turned the other way and tried to reach a police call box half a block away . The man caught and stabbed her . She screamed " Oh , my God , he stabbed me ! Please help me ! Please help me ! " Lights went on in the apartment building across the street , windows opened , and a man called out , " Let that girl alone ! " <p> The assailant shrugged and walked away . Windows dosed and lights went out . The assailant returned and stabbed Genovese again . This time she screamed " I 'm dying ! I 'm dying . " Windows opened and lights went on  --  many more than before . The assailant walked to his car and drove away . After he left , Kitty Genovese crawled along the street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building , and dragged herself inside . The assailant returned once more , walked to the apartment building , tried one door and then another , found Genovese on the floor at the foot of her stairs , and stabbed her again . This time he succeeded in killing her . <p> During three separate attacks spanning 35 minutes , none of Kitty Genovese 's neighbors tried to intervene . No burly neighbor picked up a baseball bat and dashed outside to save her life . Worse , while more than 30 respectable people saw at least one of the knife attacks and heard Genovese 's screams and her pleas for help , not one of them walked to his telephone . After much deliberation , and one phone call to a friend for advice , one man finally urged another neighbor to call authorities , which she did . Police arrived in two minutes , but Kitty Genovese was already dead . <p> Interviewed afterward , conniving residents admitted , sometimes sheepishly , " I did n't want to get involved , " or " I did n't want my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been too tired to call police and had gone back to bed . Several did n't know why they had n't helped . Many residents stated that they had been afraid to call . When asked why , within the safety of their own homes or apartments , they should be afraid to make a ( perhaps anonymous ) call to police , these residents stammered and mumbled . <p> The Kitty Genovese incident  --  so dramatic , appalling , and public  --  has become a defining moment , perhaps the defining moment , in American consciousness of urban apathy in the latter half of the twentieth century . At the time it occurred , many thought the incident shocking , bizarre , and atypical . In some ways , it was . <p> But the connivance it revealed is certainly not unique  --  not unique where urban street crime is concerned and not unique in general . People connive everywhere . Family members avert their eyes from domestic abuse that is obvious to outsiders . Church councils connive at humiliation of members by power-hungry pastors who discourage questions and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pastor and offer his victims little justice  --  sometimes listening hospitably to the pastor 's " explanations , disavowals , and reinterpretations " while ostracizing. plaintiffs as troublemakers . Advisers , board members , and chief executive officers of major investment houses overlook runaway greed , check-kiting , entertainment receipts issued by brothels , and links with Mafia laundering schemes . When these signs of trouble do come home to them , they respond by raising the corporate advertising budget ( an image of health is healthy ) and by trying to pick " a few choice bits off the company 's skeleton " before it collapses . Officers of manufacturing corporations cost-account the difference between adding a relatively minor safety feature to the vehicle they make and paying legal settlements to the victims of crashes that such a safety feature would have prevented . Board members and other officers know of this gamble , approve it , and try to ignore the maimed condition of those with whom they have to settle . <p> 3 . Leaving town . Human beings follow fashions not only in clothing , automobiles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two examples of dereliction from opposite ends of the social spectrum : In the summer of 1938 , Winston Churchill kept trying to warn his colleagues in the British government that the great nation of Germany had fallen into the hands of a band of criminals , that shadows were lengthening , and that emergency decisions needed to be made . The trouble was that the upperclass men who had the power to make such decisions  --  the men who ran Parliament and the government  --  kept leaving town each weekend , thus putting themselves out of reach of telephones and of government business . William Manchester comments : <p> To Churchill 's exasperation , Britain 's ruling class continued " to take its weekends in the country , " as he put it , while Hitler " takes his countries in the weekends . " ... Suggestions that country weekends be shortened , or that provisions be made for emergencies , were met with icy stares . Britain 's leaders detested being pushed .... Haste was somehow regarded as un-British . The ruling class was not called the leisured class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life in the Northton section of Philadelphia , Elijah Anderson tackles one of the most serious , sensitive , divisive , and expanding social problems in contemporary America  --  the soaring unwed pregnancy rate ( nearly two-thirds , nationally ) in the black underclass . As elsewhere , teenagers and young adults in Northton make a lot more babies than they care for properly , and this is especially true of males . In Northton 's inner-city culture , young black males show little relish for raising a family or caring for one that they have begun . They deride " playing house " ( their term for accepting responsibility for one 's . family ) , mock those who attempt it , and , in any case , mistrust females to identify accurately the fathers of the children these females have borne . ( Streetcorner jokes sometimes center on whom babies look like , and on the uncertainty of their parentage . ) For Northton 's young males , to " get over " on a woman  --  that is , to lure her into sex with vague promises of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , particularly , to impregnate one ( or three or five ) , and to " get away without being held legally accountable for out-of-wedlock children " is to prove strength , virility , and status . To a number of underclass youths , love is only another hustle . <p> 4 . Specializing . While conducting his experiments at Yale , Milgram noticed that certain subjects would ease the strain of what they were doing to the shrieking victim in the other room by taking an exaggerated interest in the merely technical features of the experiment . They began to articulate the test words exquisitely . They began to press the generator switches officiously and with extra care . They began to perform . By specializing in this way , people shrunk the event ( " I 'm just trying to do my job well " ) so as to get it past their conscience . <p> Similarly , navigator-bombardiers focus their educated minds not on the human beings they will kill by their skill , but on the first-class operation of the high-tech weaponry that will kill them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of religious observance , but neglect the weightier matters of justice , mercy , and faith . 5 . Minimizing . People try to settle moral debts by paying just a part of them . As Lewis Smedes notes , they offer an apology when what they owe is repentance . They offer kindness in place of the much tougher virtue of love . Thus , instead of struggling to open in her children a space for long-term joy , a mother settles for short-term happiness . Instead of being a father to his children , a man sends a child-support check . Instead of a child-support check , a birthday card . Instead of a birthday card , the thought of sending one . Some husbands , in lieu of loving their wives , sit on a barstool and talk about how much they love them . 6 . Going limp . One way to evade responsibility is to play dead , to do absolutely nothing and to do it repeatedly . Hence , lazy employees who accept a day 's pay for much less than a day 's work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of bed when they do n't feel like it . Hence , middle-aged professors who , once tenured , sink into boring repetitions of old courses and into dull , uninquiring habits of mind . Hence , flat-souled college students whose main judgment of life 's sacred acts is that they are " no big deal . " <p> In a kind of cartoon , Proverbs 19:24 describes a sluggard 's approach to his meal : " He buries a hand in the dish , and will not even bring it back to his mouth . " He can do the burial part of eating , but that 's it . The sluggard will not attempt the return trip because it includes an uphill battle against the massed forces of gravity . He can not think of a good enough reason to test those forces . In fact , he can not think of a good enough reason to think . <p> Making a career of Nothing  --  wandering through malls , killing time , making small talk , watching television programs until we know their characters better than our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energies , and it shapes life into a yawn at the God and savior of the world . The person who will not bestir herself , the person who hands herself over to Nothing , in effect says to God : You have made nothing of interest and redeemed no one of consequence , including me . <p> C. S. Lewis has the devil Screwtape explain to the junior devil Wormwood that the man he is after can be drawn from God by Nothing : <p> Nothing is very strong : strong enough to steal away a man 's best years not in sweet sins but in a dreary flickering of the mind over it knows not what and knows not why , in the gratification of curiosities so feeble that the man is only half aware of them , in drumming of fingers and kicking of heels , in whistling tunes that he does not like , or in the long , dim labyrinth of reveries that have not even lust or ambition to give them a relish , but which , once chance association has started them , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The only thing that matters is the extent to which you separate the man from the Enemy . Murder is no better than cards if cards can do the trick . Indeed , the safest road to Hell is the gradual one  --  the gentle Mope , soft : underfoot , without sudden turning , without milestones , without signposts . <p> 7 . Cocooning . Some of us retreat into the small world defined by our friends , work , church , and family and build a snuggery there . Inside it , we may be busy enough , but with only local concerns . Perhaps on television we watch with disdain or amazement the passing show of misery , novelty , and grief in the larger world outside , but if our insulation is good enough , we need not be disturbed and , in any case , we do not wish to be inconvenienced . We do not welcome strangers into our lives or homes , and we do not go out to meet them . We do not inform ourselves of events abroad and can not locate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs of future generations . We have never dealt seriously with a homeless person . We do not grieve over news stories of poverty or starvation , and we make only token efforts to relieve such suffering by our charity . Claiming allegiance to the Christ who speaks in active imperatives ( Go ! Tell ! Witness ! Declare ! Proclaim ! ) , we Christians nonetheless prefer to keep the Bread of Life in our own cupboard and to speak of it only to those who already have it . Do we , perhaps , subconsciously suppose that in such inbred silence we can keep our dignity and unbelievers can go to hell where they belong ? <p> Perhaps the last refuge of the self-protective soul is the web of its own feelings . This is true of the modern neurotic who , in the fashion of Woody Allen , rummages endlessly through the layerings of his obsessions and hangups , seeking the sources , contours , streams , and eddies of his own creativity , and of his own consciousness of his own creativity . It is true as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Martin ( " Miss Manners " ) remarks that in this age of the imperial self and its sovereign feelings , bad-mannered persons no longer feel embarrassed over their sins of omission . To the contrary , they expect credit for them : <p> Such omissions as not visiting the dying or attending funerals , and not sending thank-you letters in return for hospitality , favors , or presents , were once perceived as evidence of rudeness , presumably prompted by selfishness or sloth . Now the explanations ( " I want to remember him as he was " ; " Funerals give me the creeps " ; " I hate to write letters " ; " People should do things just because they want to , not because they expect to be thanked " ) imply that there is virtue in these failures . <p> 8 . Amusing ourselves to death . If we had no other barometer of American interest in amusement , we could measure it by the salaries of professional athletes and other entertainers . By this barometer , we value amusement more than good law , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or scientific research . For these are all salary-or fee-compensated professions in which , very often , the financial rewards pale by comparison with those for baseball players , rock singers , and talk-show hosts . In a capitalist culture , money is how you keep score , and in the professions , such as medicine and football , salaries and fees separate the winners from the also-rans . Thus , the orthopedic surgeon who examines the anterior cruciate ligament of a bench-sitting guard for a professional basketball team is looking , and likely looking up , at his cultural superior . <p> And , of course , jocks and downs are important people . We need them and what they do . Who does n't need and relish amusement now and then ? Who does n't need a partly playful attitude toward her own work ? Is n't it the sin of pride that turns so much of human life gray with earnestness ? Is n't grace , not achievement , the light of the gospel and the center of the Reformation ? Still , the value we place on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the sense of a playful relief from the main business of life , but also in the sense of a distraction from it , an evasion of it , a sometimes grim , big-business alternative to it . <p> When people begin to focus their lives more on amusement than on doing their work well , raising their children securely , gaining an education , and helping those in need , they begin to evade responsibility . The problem is that the evasions are lots of fun and therefore very tempting to all of us . It takes strength to resist them . When we fail , when a whole society fails to resist , life turns around in such a way that consumerism and the hunger for unreality converge and the spending of one 's leisure becomes one 's occupation . Being a deft and knowing consumer of clothes ( ones that make a statement ) , films , sports events , pro wrestling , concerts , tapes , compact disks , and video games  --  and especially of the entertainment products in which these things combine  --  becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its success . <p> Even Christian worship has been affected by the national obsession with amusement , perhaps in part because worshipers watch a lot of television and some of them watch a lot of televised worship . But worship does not fit the television medium very well , just as the music of a string quartet does not fit well into the warmup events of Saturday night auto races . The reason , as Nell Postman observes , is that we can not consecrate the space in which we experience TV religion  --  it is the same room and the same screen we associate with sitcoms , hockey games , and cartoons . Moreover , we are able , and we know we are able , to change channels on anything , including a prayer that lacks pizzazz . Everything about our experience of TV tells us that it is an entertainment medium ; everything about our experience of TV religion tells us that its producers know this at least as well as we do . After watching many hours of Robert Schuller , Oral Roberts , Jimmy Swaggart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viewer can see with her own eyes . On TV , " everything that makes religion an historic , profound and sacred human activity is stripped away ; there is no ritual , no dogma , no tradition , no theology , and , above all , no sense of spiritual transcendence . On these shows , the preacher is tops . God comes out as second banana . " <p> These developments remind us that corruptions of true religion generally proceed in the same direction as corruptions of the general culture , and that our contemporary religion , to borrow some words from John Henry Newman , would therefore benefit from becoming " vastly more superstitious , more bigoted , more gloomy , more fierce "  --  not because these qualities are desirable , but because they would serve as an antidote to our superficial cheeriness , because they would shorten the grins on the happy faces of show-biz religion . <p> DERELICTS <p> At the heart of all such evasive maneuvers lies a more fundamental evasion , or perhaps two others . The sinner who abandons his children , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or who shuffles back to bed instead of helping someone who is being stabbed in the street has turned his back not only on his neighbor , but also on God , and even , in some way , on himself . By refusing his calling he extracts his own core , hollowing himself out to a shell of a . human being , without weight or substance . <p> How so ? Our neighbor is God 's child just as we are : to sell a neighbor short is therefore to sell God short and to fail a brother or sister . We ourselves are God 's children : to fail God and our brothers and sisters is to shrink our own role in the great drama of redemption and to cut some of the lines that attach us to its center . The gospel , after all , is a portrait of the courage of Jesus Christ  --  the one who " set his face like flint " to go to Jerusalem and meet its terrors , the one who gathered himself to undertake there the one piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . <p> The gifts of God  --  vitality , love , forgiveness , courage against evil , joy at our depths , and everything else that flows from the terrible work of Christ  --  may be found only in the company of God . And we keep company with God only by adopting God 's purposes as our own and following through on them even when it is initially difficult or painful to do so . To place ourselves in range of God 's choicest gifts , we have to walk with God , work with God , lean on God , cling to God , come to have the sense and feel of God , refer all things to God . Contrary to our self-interested impulses , we have to worship God with a disciplined spirit and an expectant heart . <p> Despite certain modern assumptions , life with God is n't mainly a matter of knuckling under to our superior , the image that modernity so much detests . We do have to trust and obey , not first of all to be " happy in Jesus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sons and daughters , to mature into the image of God , to grow into adult roles in the business of redeeming the world . God wants from us not numb obedience but devoted freedom , creativity , and energy . God wants not slaves but intelligent , grownup children who show enthusiasm for the family business . <p> In short , we are to become responsible beings : ones to whom God may entrust deep and worthy assignments , expecting us to respond by making something significant of them  --  expecting us to make something significant of our lives themselves . No one of our lives is an accident . None of us simply finds herself here in the world . We have been called into existence , expected , awaited , equipped , and assigned . We have been called to undertake the stewardship of a good creation , to create sturdy and buoyant families that pulse with the glad give-and-take of the generations . We are expected to show hospitality to strangers and to express gratitude to friends and teachers . We have been assigned to seek justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relieve them from the tyranny of their suffering . Some of us have been called , in imitation of Christ , to bear unusual suffering of our own . <p> But we have also been called , and graced , to delight in our lives , to feel their irony and angularity , to make something sturdy and even lovely of them . For such undertakings , we have to find emotional and spiritual funds from the very God who assigns them , turning our faces toward God 's light so that we may be drawn to it , warmed by it , bathed in it , revitalized by it . Then we have to find our role within God 's big project , the one that stretches across the border from this life into the next . To be a responsible person is to find one 's role in the building of shalom  --  the rewebbing of God , humanity , and all creation in justice , harmony , fulfillment , and delight . To be a responsible person is to find one 's own role and then , funded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to delight in it . <p> The alternative is more hopeless than we ever imagined on the rainiest Monday morning of our lives . For when we flee responsibility , we turn our backs on God 's presence and blessing , we walk out on the one work project that will outlast every recession , and we begin the slow process of converting ourselves into derelicts . We " hate the light and do not come to the light . " Instead , we gather all we have and make our way toward a far country , toward the outer darkness , toward a place of self-deprivation , a place of our own making . <p> PHOTO : A baby with a tatoo on his arm . <p> By CORNELIUS PLANTINGA , JR . <p> <p> Cornelius Plantinga , Jr. , is professor of systematic theology at Calvin Theological Seminary in Grand Rapids , Michigan , and the author of Assurances of the Heart ( Zondervan ) .
