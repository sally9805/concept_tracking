// FOR THE FOURTH month in a row , Dell 's Latitude CPi D300XT reigns atop the power notebook chart . It 's not the first time a Dell system has enjoyed a long run as a Best Buy , even though the company 's notebooks are no more cutting-edge than those from other vendors . High scores in reliability and servicetwo categories our readers value greatly-help keep Dell on top . To be sure , we occasionally hear from a reader who 's hopping mad about a Dell support fumble . But in our surveys , the latest of which polled more than 68oo PC World readers , Dell consistently ranks among the vendors with the largest percentage of satisfied customers . For the Latitude line , the company offers one of the best support packages , including a three-year warranty on parts . Notebooks in Dell 's Inspiron line , which also appear regularly on our charts , are backed for three years on labor , too . Only Gateway comes close to matching Dell 's record . On the budget chart we have a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The only one of nine new notebooks tested this month to earn a spot on our list , the $1899 Voyager 1212 is an outstanding performer for the price . AGP GOES PORTABLE A YEAR AFTER becoming standard equipment in Pentium II desktops , the Accelerated Graphics Port-a bus designed to improve computer graphics-is beginning to appear on some high-end notebooks . Does AGP make a difference ? In our informal tests ( for details about these , see PC World Online , www.pcworld.com/ nov98/agpnotes ) , notebooks equipped with AGP rendered both 2D and AGPoptimized 3D graphics , such as bar and pie charts used in presentations , much more smoothly than laptops that transferred graphics data through the older PCI bus . Programs launched faster , and 3D graphics lost the jerky , pixelated appearance familiar to users of PCI-based notebooks . But the improvements are n't due to the bus alone : AGP-equipped notebooks usually come packed with lots of video RAM , faster processors , and bigger hard drives . Though many AGP portables are too expensive at the moment to gain widespread acceptance , they 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applications on the go . But not all advances are as welcome . For example , we 're sorry to say good-bye to energy-efficient Pentium MMX mobile chips ; they 'll be replaced very soon by a new generation of power-hungry Intel CPUs . Intel claims most notebook users are willing to sacrifice battery life for power . What do you think ? Frustrated by the few hours you get off a battery charge ?

This Month 's Best Buys POWER NOTEBOOKS 1 DELL LATITUDE CPI D300XT PRO : Very fast ; excellent keyboard CON : Modem not included Another price drop , this time to a reasonable $3148 , seals this corporate-targeted notebook 's place at the top of our power chart for another month . A pleasure to use , the Latitude CPi D300XT earned a PC WorldBench score of 159 , placing it among the fastest notebooks we 've ever tested . // As with its predecessor , the nearly identical Latitude CPi D266XT , the D300XT 's pleasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the current notebook standard of 2 inches ) and includes one modular bay on the side . Weighing in at 7.4 pounds and offering slightly more than 3 hours of battery life , the D300XT is more than adequate for work away from the office . You can increase its travel life by buying the optional $169 second battery and using two batteries at once . The Latitude CPi D300XT comes with a responsive , accurate touchpad and an excellent keyboard . Its adequate-size keys offer crisp action and occupy the expected positions , so adapting from a desktop keyboard to the D300XT 's is a breeze . And you should n't have to worry about upgrading the unit 's hard drive any time soon : At 6.4GB , it 's one of the largest notebook hard drives currently available . The CPi D300XT 's brilliant screen produces a sharp image from edge to edge . We do have one gripe with the casing around the display , though : It 's wider at the top of the screen , so when the lid is closed , it protrudes slightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a result , if the portable should ever fall onto its side , the fragile screen would absorb much of the shock . As with most notebooks , the D300XT 's built-in stereo speakers yield tinny sound . But MIDI music sounds better thanks to a software wavetable synthesizer . Though Dell generally earns high service and reliability marks from PC World readers , we 've sometimes encountered long waits during our anonymous calls to its technical support line . 1 UNICENT VOYAGER 1212 PRO : Fastest notebook under $2000 on chart , long-lasting battery , lightweight CON : Basic design , generic documentation , short support hours , frail keyboard Unicent , a direct marketer that made a name for itself with its supercheap desktop systems , now tops our budget notebooks chart with the phenomenally inexpensive Voyager 1212 . We 've practically never seen a Pentium II-266 laptop with active-matrix screen and 4GB hard drive selling for less than two grand . So the $1899 Voyager is a nice choice for individuals or small businesses on a budget , especially when you consider its long battery life . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's plain , boxy , silver-colored case wo n't turn many heads . And its convenient but limiting configuration-which includes built-in floppy and CD-ROM drives-prevents you from swapping in a DVD-ROM drive or adding a second battery . On the other hand , the Voyager features an easy-toremove hard drive : Just press a lever and pull the drive out of the right side of the case . The battery also lifts out easily . Some of the Voyager 's other features clearly indicate that the notebook was designed for travel . The battery lasts 3 hours and 22 minutes , at least 20 minutes longer than most Pentium II-266 notebooks with 12.1-inch screens we 've tested . With a case measuring 1.75 inches and a traveling weight of 7.3 pounds , the Voyager is a hair thinner and a feather lighter than a standard notebook . A built-in modem means you do n't have to bother with a fragile PC Card connector . // Durability , though , does n't seem to be one of the Voyager 's strengths . The laptop 's touchpad and keyboard are comfortable , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one to pop off . Using the external volume control buttons also gave us pause ; we had to press so hard on the strangely designed and fragile-looking buttons located at the top of the keyboard that we feared they 'd break . Like most small vendors , Unicent provides a support package that looks skimpy next to a Dell or Gateway plan . The Voyager 's manual , presented successively in four languages , covers little beyond the basics . The company limits technical support hours to 12 hours on weekdays and 7 hours on Saturday . If you do n't need wall-to-wall coverage , though , the Voyager offers first-rate speed at a bargain-basement price . Near Misses Eight of the notebooks we tested this month failed to make our charts . Three are highlighted below ; the other five are listed in the " Beyond the Top 10 " box on page 215 . THIS MONTH 'S chart missers ranged from a jumbo corporate model from Compaq to a new version of a thin IBM ThinkPad . Of these , a Pentium MMX-233 from Progen came closest to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Progen 's $14,99 Venture M233 reminds us of a pair of sensible shoes : not flashy , but affordable and comfortable . The boxy , black , 8.3-pound notebook comes with just about everything built in-a floppy drive , a CDROM drive , and a 56-kbps modem . The entire notebook , including the firm keyboard and the smooth touchpad , feels well built . At this price , you do n't get a big hard drive ( just 2GB ) , but you do get a spacious 13.3-inch active-matrix screen . The Venture M233 has a middleof-the-road battery life of about 3 hours and a modest PC WorldBench 98 score of 112 , which is nevertheless higher than most similarly configured notebooks . The notebook 's audio features , documentation , and support plan are nothing to write home about-phone calls are n't answered on weekends-but they 'll do in a notebook this cheap . If nothing on our budget chart grabs your attention , take a close look at this inexpensive option . FLEXIBLE FUJITSU NO OTHER NOTEBOOK-not even one from NEC 's trailblazing Versa lineoffers as many mix-and-match @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you can afford these extras , you can configure this attractive 8.2-pound desktop replacement in dozens of ways , depending on your computing needs . Unfortunately , Fujitsu 's spotty record on support and notebook reliability prevents us from recommending its portables for now . We 're also not crazy about the LifeBook 's ErgoTrac-a big round button that takes the place of a touchpad-because we suspect that some users will find it hard to master . And the E35o 's mouse buttons are hard plastic slivers that our thumbs missed nearly every time . On the positive side , we found the E35o easy to type on , once we got used to the slightly rounded wrist rest ( which at first gave our hands the sensation of being pushed away ) . The LifeBook 's brightness slider , one of its better features , beats the pants off standard hot-key combinations for screen adjustments . We also loved its LED status indicator . Located at the top of the keyboard , it reports on notebook activities with easy-to-see flashing letters . The LifeBook accommodates a wide range of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The left bay accepts the floppy drive ; the right bay takes a DVD-ROM drive , LS-12o drive , Zip drive , or second hard drive ( all sold at extra cost ) . Either bay will hold the CDROM drive or a battery , an unusually flexible arrangement . According to Fujitsu , all the options can be hot-swapped and shared across the E series of notebooks . We have n't tested any similarly configured notebooks , but the E35o 's PC WorldBench 98 score of 146 is about what we 'd expect from a PII-3oo equipped with Windows 95 and only 32MB of RAM . A useful " Getting Started " foldout guide labels parts of the notebook , lists the utilities , and provides tips on how to optimize battery life . The thorough user guide includes a glossary , a big troubleshooting section , and lots of helpful illustrations . HORSEPOWER IN HAND YEEE-HAW ! AMS Tech 's Rodeo loloCT is a frisky little filly whose long-lived battery will let you ride the range half the day before heading back to the ranch . She 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she 's not built to take lots of extra accessories . You 'll have to scrape by with less documentation and shorter support hours than those big-city companies offer , toothat 's why the Rodeo does n't make our chart . But those are the only burrs under our saddle . For a Pentium II-300 with a DVD-ROM drive and an active-matrix screen , $2495 is pretty durn good . The Rodeo 's basic design includes fixed DVDROM and floppy drives , so you ca n't swap in other options . The Rodeo 's touchpad and keyboard worked just fine , but we noticed that the keys have a loose , springy sound and feel to them , giving us a slight case of the yips about its durability . Screen resolution is limited to 8oo by 6oo , but that 's not a problem unless you have a hankerin ' for every last millimeter of desktop or spreadsheet . The Rodeo 's stereo speakers , which are located near the notebook 's hinges , deliver that sheriffs star sound-slightly tinny . We cottoned to AMS Tech 's unique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dial , three function keys-for turning the sound up , down , and off-make controlling volume from the keyboard as easy as falling off a horse .
