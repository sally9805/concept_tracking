<p> Supporters of water ruling throw snowballs at Al Knight <p> Al Knight 's article July 9 in the Perspective section concerning the Colorado Supreme Court 's Snowmass Creek decision asserts that the decision was " poorly thought out " and suggests it was a victory for environmental extremism . On the contrary , the decision simply requires a government agency to comply with legal procedures . <p> In 1980 the Colorado Water Conservation Board obtained a water court decree recognizing the appropriation of a flow of 12 cubic feet per second to preserve the natural environment of Snowmass Creek to a reasonable degree . To get this decree , CWCB had to prove to the court that this amount of water was available in the creek , that there was a natural environment to be protected , and that this was the minimum amount of water necessary to preserve this environment . Sometime around 1990 the Aspen Ski Company decided it wanted to make snow at the Snowmass ski area . It needed to divert water from Snowmass Creek in the winter for this . <p> Remarkably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact claimed too much water in 1980 . Coincidentally , the amount of this overclaim exactly equalled the amount of water needed by Aspen Ski Company for its snowmaking uses . <p> The General Assembly , in its wisdom , has chosen to vest the CWCB with " exclusive authority " to seek and obtain water rights for instream flows . Colorado 's citizens depend entirely on this agency to represent and protect their interests in the multiple values that are provided when there is adequate water in streams to support fisheries , maintain aquatic ecosystems , allow rafting , maintain water quality , etc . The decision to go to water court to seek a water right for this purpose is entirely within the discretion of this agency . <p> At the root of the Snowmass Creek litigation is the fundamental issue of the purpose of the instream flow program . What does it mean to " preserve the natural environment to a reasonable degree " ? What is the minimum amount of streamflow necessary for this purpose ? Is it the minimum quantity of water at which fish can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one do not believe that the purpose of protecting remaining undeveloped streamflows in this state is simply to allow fish to survive . Rather it seems to me the intention is to keep in place those all-too-few remaining streams in the state where fish can thrive , where the aesthetic pleasures of a flowing stream still exist , where the riparian vegetation is supported , where the stream channel is flushed and functioning , where the water is clean and clear - in short , to preserve a critical part of Colorado 's heritage that is in too-short supply these days . <p> I applaud the Colorado Supreme Court for its acknowledgement that the CWCB acts on behalf of all of us when it acts to protect instream flows . As part of its fiduciary responsibility to the public , surely the CWCB ought to follow the same procedures when it decides to reduce instream flow protections as when it chooses to establish them . The court 's decision holds only this much . <p> The real test is before us . What is our commitment as a state to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rivers ? It is time , I believe , to face that question directly . <p> LARRY MacDONNELL <p> Boulder <p> Al Knight , in his article on July 9 , revealed several misunderstandings about the case Aspen Wilderness Workshop brought against the Colorado Water Conservation Board over the instream flow water right in Snowmass Creek . The instream flow had been decreed by the water court in 1976 for 12 cubic feet per second ( cfs ) , year-round . The board , in September 1992 , without going back to the water court , on its own voted to reduce that right from 12 cfs to 7 cfs in the wintertime . It did so because it was asked to do so by the Aspen Skiing Company , which believes it should have the right to divert the " extra " 5 cfs out of the stream to make snow . <p> The record of the 1992 proceedings before the board reveals that the board 's primary concerns were how much water the Ski Company needed ; what its schedule was for putting in snowmaking equipment ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The board did not even have a single winter study to support its sudden decision that 7 cfs , rather than 12 , was sufficient to support fish life in Snowmass Creek through the winter . Although the board stated that it was basing its decision to reduce the instream flow on a " mistake " it had discovered in its original worksheets from 1975 , when it concluded 12 cfs was necessary , it was only well after the proceedings for reducing the right were under way before this discovery was announced . <p> Aspen Wilderness Workshop , which consists of volunteers , challenged the board 's action . Al Knight 's characterization of the workshop as " some **26;1131;TOOLONG inhabitants of the Snowmass Creek area , a pricey sector where some home sites cost millions and where a number of out-of-town celebrities have million-dollar vacation homes , " is Ski Company propaganda . A far more accurate characterization of this group , founded in 1965 , is that its members are longtime residents of the Roaring Fork Valley concerned about protecting the natural resources of the Valley . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - who , despite the denigrating label , also care very much about the Valley they live in - but four of the five members of the Aspen City Council ; one Pitkin County commissioner , prominent area business persons and several employees of the ski company itself . <p> The Supreme Court wisely ruled that the board did not have the power to modify a decree of the water court . It wisely , and importantly , ruled that the board has a trust responsibility toward the instream flow rights it has acquired on behalf of the public : the board is required to protect these rights to the full extent of their decrees . The board should take its cue from this decision , and spend not another dime on reducing the instream flow right on Snowmass ( or any other ) Creek . It should spend its money on protecting and enforcing what it already has . <p> ALISON MAYNARD <p> Denver <p> Violent crime breaks through jurisdictional lines <p> The recent drive-by shooting in Parker has prompted comments from residents echoing those of town officials about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threat to the ' quality of life " ' here in Parker and Douglas County . <p> I am a 36-year-old native of Colorado , grew up in Aurora and now reside in Parker . In the late 60s and on through the 70s , Aurora was what Parker is now - a distant , low crime , upscale suburb of Denver . It was one of the fastest growing areas of the country . People flocked there in search of their own version of " quality of life . " <p> Because of the lower crime at the time , people had the arrogance to believe that " it ca n't happen here " - similar to the attitude in Parker and Douglas County today . Many parents allowed their children to roam unsupervised far too often and far too long as things progressed and crime increased , Aurora residents tended to blame it on an influx of people from L.A. , and other high crime areas of the country instead of their own lack of parental supervision . <p> In regard to the recent shooting Parker residents and town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aurora or Denver . No one seems the least bit concerned with the report that the house where the two shot-up teens fled was occupied by two teens who were home alone while mom and dad were off vacationing . If this report is accurate then as a community this should scare us as much as the shooting itself . <p> Maybe this is your wake-up call . Stop blaming surrounding communities for increased problems to your area when you are making exactly the same mistakes that they did . <p> If you truly want to hold on to your " quality of life " here in Parker and Douglas County , try rechanneling all that energy that is wasted in fighting each other about politics , airports and land deals into making sure you know where your children are and who they are with . <p> D.

Then , for some obscure reason , you apparently found it necessary to repeat this quote on your next day 's editorial page . <p> I am disgusted with your sweeping statements of repeated insinuations about Aurora . The truth is that Aurora 's crime rate has been on the decrease , due to major efforts of our city government , mayor and police department . I would appreciate your acknowledgement of this fact and an apology for your continued down-grading of a fine community which is a very good place to live . <p> DOROTHY L.

" <p> GWENDOLYN H. SCOTT <p> Denver <p> Seniors have earned the <p> right not to ' rough it ' <p> In response to Matthew G. Leman 's letter ( July 13 ) concerning recreational vehicles in national parks , I could n't help but wonder how he will regard those gas guzzling behemoths when he is a septuagenarian . <p> In my younger days my family and I " tented it " in national parks for many a year , but that involved more than " a tent , a sleeping bag , a stove and a smile . " It included polluting the environment with wood smoke , dish water and human waste , however carefully handled . Self-contained vehicles add exhaust fumes to the atmosphere , but carry the rest of their pollutants out of the parks .

" <p> AL STRAND <p> Englewood <p> Aquifer recharge costs <p> more than mountain dams <p> Governor Romer 's new plan to store South Platte river water underground for Front Range needs is another costly diversion to avoid critical statewide water decisions . <p> Instead of wasting energy to pump limited waters into and out of the ground , Colorado should be saving its unused West Slope snowmelt in high altitude reservoirs for low-cost gravity delivery to both slopes during the damaging drought cycles . <p> Aquifer recharge is an unapproved concept that would only divert the state from its urgent need to develop and use its threatened Colorado River Compact water . During any 10-year period , there are only a few short times when the over-subscribed South Platte River has enough surplus water for underground pumping . <p> River water must first be treated and then slowly injected into deep wells with high-energy pumps . Fossil-fuel energy is again consumed when this relatively small amount of water is pumped out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the time expensive pumps would be idle , while Colorado 's vast unused share of the Colorado River is being permanently lost to the grateful Arizona , Nevada and California growth areas . <p> Western hydrologists know that Colorado 's water future is threated by its native bias against headwater storage . Unfortunately , the lawyers who now control Colorado 's water strategy do not understand the long-term threat and need to plan , build , and store wet year runoff at high altitude to maximize the environmental and economic benefits for all Coloradans . <p> DAVID MILLER <p> Palmer Lake <p> Post covers Archdiocese <p> without fear or favor <p> The Post is to be commended for its reporting of recent events in the Archdiocese of Denver .
