Impose special taxes on carbon-dioxide emissions <P> This proposal , designed to head off global warming , has gone nowhere , despite the efforts of the United Nations Environment Program to forge a worldwide treaty limiting the release of carbon dioxide . In the U.S. , a primary producer of CO2 , new taxes are anathema to the current Administration in any case . The President has declared that global warming is a problem that needs study , not immediate action . <P> Toughen auto fuel-efficiency standards <P> In the absence of higher gasoline taxes , setting strict fuel-efficiency requirements for new cars is an alternative route to conservation . The technology exists to boost the average mileage achieved by U.S. cars from 26.5 m.p.g. to 45 m.p.g. by 2000 . But under President Bush , the federally mandated average will be raised only to 27.5 m.p.g. this year . <P> Launch a mammoth international tree-planting program <P> This idea is a favorite of everyone 's , from industrial giants like Union Carbide , which has promised to plant half a million trees by 2000 , to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a billion trees each . Still unclear : Will the funding come through ? <P> Ban CFC production completely <P> Under the 1987 Montreal Protocol , the major nations have already pledged a 50% reduction in the production of ozone-destroying chlorofluorocarbons by 1999 . Last year the European Community and the U.S. tentatively agreed to push for a complete ban by the end of the century . The task now is to translate that understanding into a formal treaty , which should include all nations , especially the Soviet Union and East European countries . In the meantime , plastic-foam manufacturers in the U.S. say they will stop using CFCs in their products , and Vermont has decreed that the chemicals must be eliminated from auto air-conditioners in new cars sold in the state after 1993 . Major CFC suppliers like Du Pont are developing substitutes that are much less harmful to the ozone . <P> Ban the export of waste <P> Last year representatives of 105 nations agreed to the Basel Convention governing international shipments of waste . The document would not ban waste exports altogether , but it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless adequate environmental precautions were taken and the government of the importing nation gave its approval . The convention has been ratified by the governments of three nations , and will go into force when it is approved by 17 more . <P> Make birth-control information and devices available to every man and woman . <P> Many countries have increased their contributions to the United Nations Fund for Population Activities , the pre-eminent organization in the distribution of birth-control information and devices . The Soviet Union began giving UNFPA hard currency last year for the first time . But the U.S. has contributed nothing to the fund since 1985 . Reason : UNFPA conducts programs in nations like China , where abortions are encouraged  --  a situation politically unacceptable to the Reagan and Bush Administrations . The U.S. also refuses to give money to the International Planned Parenthood Federation because it actively supports abortion . <P> Develop local organizations and educational programs to impress upon people the value of nature 's genetic diversity                   @ @
