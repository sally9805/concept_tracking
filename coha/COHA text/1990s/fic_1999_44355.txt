When a big institution commits a crime , there may be little that an individual can do about it . But does that mean he must do nothing ? Photograph <p> Alpha Centauri A was chosen for a few very simple reasons . First , it was close-a mere 4.3 light years from Earth . Second , it was a G2  --  type star , similar enough to the sun that data taken directly from Sol could be used in software models without requiring complex conversions . But the most important factor was greed . Each star in the Centauri system had adequate fusion material to support the new propulsion systems , but Centauri A was the largest of the three , with a mass ten times that of Proxima and twenty percent greater than Centauri B. The supply of resources in A would last that much longer . And in the end , that was the factor that doomed the star to an accelerated death . Lieutenant Commander Torrance Black stood on the gunmetal runway that circled Everguard 's pod engineering assembly area . The rail was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palms . Machinery ozone seeped through the open grate of the floor and hung around him like an acrid memory , unchangeable but vaguely distant . Everything appeared to be on plan . Each tube bay stood open , the collection forming a perfectly spaced row of a dozen chambers , their three-meter-diameter spans empty , pristinely round , and gleaming with stainless steel beauty . The wormhole pods that went into these tubes were the size of G-class riders-fifty meters tip-to-tip but rounded in cross-section to fit into the circular tubes . Their surfaces were coated with rugged brown thermal material that made them appear starkly utilitarian in the brightly lit assembly area . Each end was capped with conical black boots of heat-treated alloy , and banded with a titanium-steel ceramic composite fashioned in the zero-g environment of Armstrong station . His staff wore their fresh whites today . Their voices echoed with professional bearing in the open expanse . A computer reported the status of the automated routine that controlled much of the launch sequence . " I want these tubes loaded by 1800 hours , folks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realized , was a little too much vinegar . " We 'll make it , LC , " Malloy replied with a quick salute . Torrance returned the gesture halfheartedly , then stepped into his glass enclosed office . He settled into his chair , sighed , and stared through the computer 's holographic image of the wormhole pod 's internal guts . LC . The title echoed in his mind like silence after an angry scream . Lieutenant Commander . That was the thing about rank in the military . Everyone understood what a rank meant . Rank labeled a man , and it stayed with him . It would not be long before the promotion list was made public , not long before everyone knew where Torrance stood . He would change the world today . As chief launch engineer , he would release a dozen wormhole pods that would burrow into Centauri A. Their external shells would burn rapidly inside the star 's core , and if at least nine of the twelve systems made it to the target point , they would rend space and create the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would flow to the other side where fellow servicemen would latch these extradimensional warps to the back end of starships . Then the universe would be open for the first time . FTL . Faster-than-light travel . Sirius for breakfast , Aldebaran for dinner . He supposed he should feel something appropriate . But Kip Levitt , commanding officer of the ship 's Propulsion Center , and a man Torrance had gone to school with so many years ago , had been promoted to full commander today . Torrance had not . And it did n't take a lifer to know that when a man in the chain of command is passed over for promotion , his career , for all effective purposes , is over . The comm light flashed green on Torrance 's desktop . " Messages , please , " he said . The image of one of his ensigns filled the desk 's primary view screen . " All tubes loaded , and the power system is charged , sir . Final prognostics are running now . " " Thank you , " Torrance replied , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on hold until the admiral arrives . " " Aye , sir , I 'll tell Lieutenant Malloy . " The display returned to software circuitry Torrance had been working with prior to the message . He pressed a control pad and accessed data from the propulsion system . Green numbers read three hundred plus terra electron volts . A collider ringed the ship at a radius of fifty-three kilometers . Outside the observation panel , Centauri A 's light made it a gleaming sliver of silver against the black velvet sky . Torrance grimaced , thinking about the particles inside the ring with something akin to jealousy . They were lucky , he thought . Their fate was revealed on a time scale of picoseconds . Torrance sighed . Every member of the pod crew , including Torrance himself , filled other jobs during the flight and would be reassigned back to them during the trip home . For example , Lieutenant Karl Malloy , his chief operations officer , was a nav analyst second class , a job that amounted to gathering data for shipboard navigation controllers . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chief service engineer , responsible for resolving problems with anything from fried communications systems to stopped-up toilets . Not exactly glamorous . But then he supposed that could be said about his entire career . He had new er been one to seek out the limelight  --  like Kip Levitt . He had n't been a football hero at the Academy or a leading officer candidate . He did n't grab control in survival school in times of emergency . Instead , Torrance faced difficult times by immersing himself in work , filling his thoughts with code so that his brain did n't have time to spin out of control over something it could not change . Hell , the entire Everguard mission was just another case of burying his head in the sand . He rose from his upholstered chair , and stepped around his curved desk to walk into the main assembly area . At the same moment , the entry doors dilated , and Admiral Hatch entered with a full escort of petty officers and assistants , including Torrance 's CO , Captain Alexandir Romanov . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presented a stiff  --  backed salute . " As you were , " the admiral replied . The admiral was an older man with brown hair that showed gray at the razor line of his nonexistent sideburns . His green eyes sparkled , and he walked with an efficient stride that spoke of attention to detail and purpose of mind . " What is our status , Lieutenant Commander ? " " Green for launch , sir . " " That 's good . Your men are a credit to the service , Torrance . " " Thank you , sir , " Torrance replied , glancing toward Captain Romanov . Romanov smiled . " Indeed you are . " The captain 's presence sizzled against Torrance 's mind . Indeed you are . What bullshit . Without doubt it had been Romanov , a rigid , by-the-book-at-all-costs type of man , who allowed the promotion billet to pass Torrance by . The staff worked in the area below them , checking status displays and ensuring every firing assembly , safety release , and navigation system was operational . They closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anodized black discs evenly spaced along the curved wall like rounds in an old Remington Colt . Power surged in the launch system . Twelve external launch doors dilated open with the recognizable groan of hydraulic pressure . " Ten seconds to engage , " a recorded voice echoed the red readout that hung on the wall . Torrance 's spine tingled .. He thought about his mother and father , and he wondered how they were . With the time it took message traffic to travel from Earth to Everguard , it was possible they were no longer even alive . He had never really thought of that before . The digital readout said seven . The power coils whined as they sucked energy from the collider . The image of Cal McKinley , a highschool friend , came over him . His years at the Academy , his first posting under Captain Jao . Torrance had worked through the ranks , receiving solid commendations at every posting . But at LC there were only so many positions above him . And Romanov was by-the-book . The readout read , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in twelve wormhole pods . Three . The crew monitored the launch process . Software controllers ran on optical processors . For the first time in a long while , he thought of Adrienne . Everguard traveled at nearly six  --  tenths the speed of light , translating into a twelve local-year round-trip flight . Two . He would be forty-one when the mission was complete . The effects of time dilation would have aged the rest of the world three years beyond that . His investments would likely have doubled twice-not that there was much left after the divorce , but it should be enough to live on for a while . One . At least that was something . Launch initiated , sir . Silence echoed where there should have been thunder . The compartment held its breath . " What 's wrong ? " the admiral asked . " I have no idea , sir , " Torrance replied , his heart growing cold . " But the pods are not away . " " We 're not getting anywhere , sir , " the technician said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . The air was stale with day-old sweat . The staff was tired and defeated . Their mission-day whites hung from their bodies like whipped flags in dead wind . Displays of the launch system 's microcircuitry and software execution paths flickered against glass boards . It was 0300 and still they had no answers . " I 'm sorry , " he said , rubbing cheeks that were plastic with fatigue . " I 'm just like you guys , though-really frustrated , and even a little angry . Romanov wants a personal report at 0600 , so I 'll admit I 'm anxious to get to the root of this . I apologize for snapping , all right ? " All around , the staff nodded . " Maybe Romanov would like to take a ride in the tube to check it out personally , " Malloy said with a grin , his eyebrow raised in mock anticipation . " We could probably arrange an inspection . " The collection of men and women chuckled , and the room loosened noticeably . Lieutenant Malloy had a knack for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ image of Romanov as an icon for the upper command structure , drifting out into space from a derelict launch tube , made everyone smile . Torrance took a deep breath . " Maybe the answer is n't here . " " What do you mean , LC ? " " We 've been over everything three times . If the problem were in the onboard systems , I know we 'd have found it by now . Maybe it 's something outside . " " Like what ? " Torrance scratched his cheek , fingering overnight stubble . " I do n't know . How about we run the full spectrum of sensor scans again , OK ? " " Did that when we got here , sir , " Malloy replied . " I know , " Torrance said . " But maybe we missed something . " Malloy nodded . " OK , LC . We 'll do it . " The crew stood to get to work . " Finish the scan , " Torrance said , with a grin . " Then I order you all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Centauri system for decades prior to Everguard 's launch . They listened for signals and imaged it with deep-space telescopes . They scanned with radio interferometers , looking for telltale wobble . It was Mars station that finally discovered three planets orbiting A and two that orbited B. Only the second planet from Centauri A , however , was inside the zone where liquid water-and thereby intelligent life-was possible . Scientists quickly dubbed the planet Eden , but closer study soon determined it to be anything but . Its atmosphere was a horrific mixture of methane , carbon dioxide , and sulfuric acid that had created a runaway greenhouse effect similar to that of Venus . In addition , models suggested that extreme tidal forces of the Centauri tri-star system would heat the planet 's core and make for a volcanic world with a stormy weather pattern that continually raged across the surface . The search for intelligent life , they said , would have to dig deeper into the universe . The good news was that it was n't his fault . It was 0515 . Torrance was early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed . Trying to relax , he rang his CO 's bell . " Romanov here . " The captain 's voice was alert and responsive through the in tercom . " Lieutenant Commander Black , sir . " The door buzzed softly , then dilated open . The ventilation system blew a cool breeze that made the back of Torrance 's neck crawl . The room was quiet , decorated with a row of flat-panel images of starships and other vehicles . Romanov was fourth-generation military , and his compartment showed it . The far wall , though , carried a holo of a waterfall from the backlands of Maui . A glass table with three chairs sat in the corner of the room . The captain rose from his meditation pad , dressed in a loose robe of red terry cloth . A thin film of sweat glistened from the curve of his collarbone . " Good morning , Captain , " Torrance said . " I think it is acceptable to be informal before 0600 , Torrance , " Romanov said with only a trace of his Russian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You look as if you 've had a very long night . Have a seat and tell me what you 've found . " Torrance sat down , not certain how to start . The captain sat across from him . " We have a problem . " " Yes ? " " When Everguard opened the launch doors we encountered an electromagnetic disturbance . " " I see no problem , then . Just shield what we need to shield and let 's get on with it . " " It 's not that simple . " " Why not ? We 've got inventory . " " Yes , we do , " Torrance admitted . " But the disturbance is coming from outside . " " Outside of what ? " " Outside of Everguard , sir . It 's coming from the star 's second planet . " Romanov thought . " Why did n't it show up in our scan ? " " I checked the logs . It was there , but the configuration of the planets and the star cut the amplitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Torrance did n't need to add that the we who just overlooked it did not include either Torrance Black or Alexandir Romanov . " l see . " The captain clasped his hands together and leaned against the table . His gaze bore into Torrance . " So , you 're thinking that a stray burst of EMI says there may be life on Eden ? " " I do n't see how we can read it any other way . " " Despite the fact that all our examinations confirm the planet 's atmosphere is toxic ? " " Only a lifeform could produce this EMI . " " The planet is a perpetual storm , " Ro manov said . It is certainly possible that such a place could generate high-energy disturbances , is it not ? " " What we 've received has been tight , Captain , not random white noise . " " Have you run our translator programs ? " " Yes . " " And ? " " Nothing yet , sir . But just because we do n't recognize a pattern does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be reviewed before we go any further . " The ventilation system wheezed like the collected mumble of distant voices . " Lieutenant Commander . " The captain 's voice became firm , and Torrance realized the discussion had just become formal . " We have a mission to accomplish . What you 've found is not enough to warrant a jump to the conclusion of intelligent life when everything else we know to be true discounts that . " Torrance froze . He had expected Romanov to point the finger of blame to the External Sensor Command and postpone the mission . But now the captain seemed more determined than ever to push forward . " What if I 'm right , Captain ? " " I do n't think that is the case . " " But , sir , if this is intelligent life , draining their star will leave them without energy . Whatever civilization exists here will die . " " I understand , Torrance , " the captain said , his eyes blazing like dark lasers . " But even a simple trip planetside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows what we would find ? Probably nothing but static-generating clouds . Do you want to hold back our understanding of the entire universe because we piddled around looking for thunderstorms in Eden ? " Torrance did not reply . " You 're a good man , lieutenant Commander , " Romanov continued . " You 've always been a part of the team . You 're a hard worker . When the going gets tough you stick your nose into the guts of our problems and figure out how to make things work . It 's a trait I most admire in you . I know I can rely on you to do what 's right for us in the big picture . " Suddenly , Torrance understood . This was about position . It was about expectations and power . If they diverted for a false call , the careers of every officer aboard would hang in tenuous balance . Torrance 's stomach burned , reminding him that the last thing he had eaten was the synthesized roast beef sandwich he had for lunch yesterday . " Thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed he should than because he felt anything . " I do understand your concerns , " the captain said . " I 'll take your report to the admiral for his confirmation of my order . But our mission here is clear . I have a duty to the people of our solar system , as do you . " Those tubes need to be shielded and another launch profile prepared as soon as possible . " " I understand , " Torrance said , standing . He understood , yes . But a cold stone formed in his stomach . The captain had just supported potential genocide of what might be an intelligent species of creatures in the name of human longevity , and he had done so with barely a second thought . " Thank you for your work , Lieutenant Commander , " Romanov said . Torrance sighed , giving into the weight of the waves crashing around him . " The staff had a late night , sir . I 've ordered them to their beds . But I think we can be ready to launch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Very good . Looks like you could use some sleep yourself . " " Yes , sir . " Torrance turned and strode out of the captain 's office , his temples suddenly throbbing with a massive headache . Torrance and Adrienne met right after he had entered the Academy . At quiet times he still thought about their wedding day , the sugary whiteness of their cake , Adrienne shoving an overly large bite into his mouth . He remembered buying their first house . They had wanted children-Adrienne pushing for three , Torrance thinking more like ten . But children never came . A series of trips to fertility doctors eventually found he was the problem . There were solutions , of course . Adoption , or donor transplants . Gene therapy . But at the time , Torrance was adamant . He could n't raise someone else 's children . Torrance did n't care that everyone else in the world was doing it . It was n't right , and no gene therapy in the world could change the fact that every time he looked into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had been scared and embarrassed . And like usual , he had ignored the problem , letting it fester until it grew black and malignant . They split a couple of months before the Everguard opportunity arose . Without Adrienne in his life , he found he needed something to focus on , something to throw himself into to take the pain away . All he had at hand was the military , with its structure and its rules that dictated what to do when and how to do it . He was suited to this environment , he realized . He felt comfortable with the service , understood how it was supposed to work . The idea of twelve years aboard the Everguard had seemed so perfect . The staff wore their workday blues this time . They placed shielding around the most sensitive of the firing system 's components . Torrance stared into the blackness of space . In less than two hours he would give an order that would expand his world , arguably saving it when looked at over millennia , but might doom another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never asked for this . His career was likely over . He would return to his own world tired and used . A forty-one-year-old man with no family , no future , and no dignity . It was the last that twisted in his gut with an edge like a serrated hunting knife . Deep down , Torrance knew his analysis was right . The signal was strong and cohesive . It was a message , but in a language their translator code had been unable to crack . There was life on that planet , and no argument the captain or anyone else aboard this ship could put forward would convince Torrance otherwise . His uniform collar seemed tight against his neck . The decision to launch the pods made him sick-made him feel exposed and dirty . He had twelve buttons to push . He was one commander . Twelve wormhole pods . One sun . One people with unknown technology . Unknown technology , he thought . But technology at least advanced enough to release emissions that interfered with Everguard 's systems . Torrance 's heart beat with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was on to something . An idea dawned , a thought that gnawed at him like a rodent trying to claw out of his belly . One technology . Energy tickled his spine . It could work , he realized . Competitive reengineering had fueled human progress for centuries . It was a huge personal risk , though , with what was left of his career at stake . He gazed out of the observation panel . The collider glimmered against black velvet . Protons and neutrons raced inside the ring , scattering themselves into the netherworld of quarks and leptons  --  universes that lived and died in fractions of seconds . A collector gathered each of these particles , separating them and funneling each into channels where supercooled electromagnets ensured they would find their antimatter counterparts . The resulting meeting of matter and antimatter pushed energy into the ship 's propulsion unit . Soon a small fraction of that power would be funneled off to feed the launch tubes . Torrance closed his eyes , listening to the ship . It was a sound he loved , a gentle hiss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had blown past his open window when he was a teenager in Wisconsin . That was a long time ago . Lives , like military careers , can be made in the span of a single collision of a neutron and a proton . And they can be broken in similar time . Or they can merely fade away , decaying like radioactive waste with a half-life of a human being . It was time , Torrance realized , feeling truly comfortable for the first time since he could remember . He knew what he had to do . " Fifteen seconds until launch , " the mission controller said . Again the admiral stood at Torrance 's side . The power coil moaned . Switches clicked and firing systems armed . The countdown dock read ten . Twelve probes stood ready to forge the link that would give the human race the ability to explore millions of stars . Five . Torrance pursed his lips , feeling oddly proud . He had done his best , and that was all that any God-or any commander , for that matter-had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't be enough . But perhaps it would . And that was sometimes the most that any man could ask of himself . Two . One . " Launch sequence is initiated , " the controller replied . The pods thrust against Everguard 's hull like the strikes of twelve sledgehammers . A dozen flaming arrows sliced through black space in formations of four . One group fell toward the star , then another . Then the last . A single element of the last , however , edged off course , twisting slightly . Adrenaline leapt through Torrance 's body with the pod 's initial lurch , and he stifled a proud smile . His calculations had been rapidly done , and the reprogramming had been equally hasty , but he knew this code like the back of his hand . If he got it right , the pod would land somewhere on the second planet . With luck , whoever was there would look at it , would examine its circuitry and its propulsion system . With their new knowledge they might learn how to engineer spacefaring vessels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves . The pod turned , rolling off the original flight plan and heading away from the sun . " What 's wrong ? " the admiral said . " I 'm not certain , sir " Torrance replied before Captain Romanov could . " But I 'll run a full investigation . The good news is that we have eleven birds on course and heading for home . We only need nine to be successful . " Romanov stared at Torrance , seeming to note the grin that rode his face . But he did not say anything . Of the remaining pods , one lost power and drifted slowly toward the star , pulled to a fiery death by Centauri A 's gravity well . The rest stayed on course , and pierced the star 's surface . Thermal shielding held back the heat for the milliseconds each electronic package needed . The wormhole actuators engaged . Energy , hydrogen fusing to helium , began to flow . Captain Romanov sat at his glass table , waiting patiently as Torrance entered . A cup of coffee and scraps of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You wanted to see me , sir ? " Romanov gestured toward an empty chair , and Torrance sat . " That was a gutsy move , Torrance . " " I beg your pardon ? " " I 've examined the preflight records . The last probe 's navigation software was altered . " Torrance considered denying it , but could see firmness in his CO 's eyes . " They deserved a fighting chance , sir . " The captain nodded . " Deliberately altering a mission profile without authorization is a trick that can get a man court-martialed . " Silence reigned for several heartbeats . " We 're stealing their sun , sir , " Torrance finally said . " I figure they 've got maybe ten thousand years before their planet gets too cold to support life . If they 're of advanced technology , they 'll be able to study the pod and maybe save themselves . " " And if they 're not ? " Torrance stared into a wall scene of the Ural Mountains and waited for the captain 's other shoe to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or merely some form of censure . Certainly he would lose at least one rank . " You do n't have a family , do you ? " Romanov said . " My parents live in Wisconsin . " " I mean children . " Torrance furrowed his brow . " No , sir . No children . " Romanov gave an indecipherable grunt and absentmindedly fingered his coffee cup . " I 'm sorry you were passed over for promotion , Torrance . You 're a good man . But we have only so many billets . " " Thank you , sir . " " You 've always worked hard . It is a long flight back home . A lot of good things can happen to a man who works hard for six years . " Torrance stared at his CO , who sat back in his chair and regarded him openly . Alexandir Romanov 's brown eyes told him everything Torrance needed to know . Romanov had made a snap decision . But he had understood its importance , and he had looked in the mirror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go against him in the end . Now the future of that unknown species rested in a wormhole pod that was speeding off into space . " I am thinking , " the captain said , " that the report I give the admiral should describe a technical problem with the guidance software of the twelfth pod . " Torrance smiled . " That could be done , sir . " The captain nodded . " Then make it happen , " he said . Lieutenant Commander Torrance Black walked briskly into his office . He needed to prepare a report , and he needed to think about his life , to plan . He had six years aboard Everguard , and if any man could get back on the promotion path , it was going to be him . And if he did n't , well . . . There were options .
