<p> HOUSE ROCK VALLEY , Ariz.  --  As dawn silhouettes the 1,100-foot walls of Vermilion Cliffs , two carloads of French tourists pull off a dirt road and point binoculars up at the tall sandstone ramparts on the north side of this isolated valley . <p> " We try to see condors ? " one of them asks expectantly when biologist Mark Vekasy drives up . <p> At 7 a.m. , Vekasy , field supervisor for the experimental release here of endangered California condors , already is running late . <p> But eight months since America 's largest and rarest bird was set free on the craggy cliffs , a steady trickle of daily visitors routinely interrupts his work . <p> After years of mixed results in California , the $ 20 million effort to put the Ice Age vultures back into the wild now has an unexpected foothold in an unlikely new home : the " Arizona strip , " the 5-million-acre desert outback from the Grand Canyon north to the Utah border . <p> Eleven of the 15 condors born in captivity and released here in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They are the first of their species to fly here in nearly 75 years . <p> As summer peaks , the homely but charismatic birds are soaring now  --  and the world is coming to watch . Almost as remarkable is that local residents now welcome both the condors and the condor watchers . At first , they were suspicious that the condors ' endangered status would mean heavy government restrictions on logging , mining , ranching and recreation . But that has n't happened because of a provision that makes these birds " **26;1367;TOOLONG . " Ranchers and others wo n't be penalized if they accidentally kill one . <p> The Boise-based Peregrine Fund , a non-profit group that works to save endangered birds and is running the project here , had to hire a staffer this summer just to field all the visitors ' questions . At sunrise , biologist Vekasy , 34 , is the only staffer at the prime viewing site , about three miles off U.S. 89A and more than a mile from the cliffs . So he pulls out his binoculars and pinpoints for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " The bird on the rim is sunning now , with his wings open , " he says . They nod back , re-focus and buzz in excited French . <p> Condor fever is contagious . Next door in New Mexico , billionaire nature-lover Ted Turner is lobbying to host and underwrite the next new release project , possibly by 1999 , on his sprawling Ladder Ranch . " There 's extremely high potential for a very successful program there , " says Robert Mesta , who heads condor reintroduction efforts for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service , which oversees release of the birds in Arizona and California . <p> In nearby Page , Ariz. , tourism boosters now market condor T-shirts and scan the skies above Lake Powell for the enormous jet-black birds with 91/2-foot wingspans and bald , beaky heads . " They have become neighbors now , " says Joan Nevills-Staveley of the Page Chamber of Commerce . <p> To the south , rangers on both rims of Grand Canyon National Park post condor updates and gladly give directions to the viewing site here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his four-member crew is such a hit on the project 's Internet page ( http : **35;1395;TOOLONG ) that there are " people showing up who will know your name before you 've even met them , " says field technician Amy Nicholas . <p> East on U.S. 89A from the Arizona release site , rustic lodges that cater to Colorado River rafters and vacationers bound for Grand Canyon 's North Rim use the condors as a selling point in their brochures . " The only way we 're going to have projects like this succeed is by having people visit them , " says Vermilion Cliffs Lodge owner Maggie Sacher . " We have to supply a quality condor experience for the public , even if they do n't see a condor flying . " <p> Sacher is striving to have a roadside marker for condors included in a planned " Vermilion Cliffs Highways " scenic loop through the Arizona-Utah border region , along with more typical markers for pioneer explorers , cowboy lore and geological features . The closest that tourists can get to the condors is a rustic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birds ' roost . In the shelter 's precious patch of summer shade , field biologists in beach chairs aim spotting scopes at the cliff rim . With high-powered optics , they can even spot the birds ' identifying numbers attached to each wing . <p> The birds sometimes perch for hours at a time . But they 'll also soar all day . The valley 's 100-degree summer days are key . By late morning , the heat spawns powerful thermal updrafts , and the condors simply sail away . They rarely flap their huge wings and can float for hours , covering great distances with little energy in the search for dead cattle , deer and other carrion . Several have flown nearly to Monument Valley about 90 miles east and to Bryce Canyon National Park about 120 miles north . In June , Condor 49 was spotted in Utah 's Arches National Park , nearly 200 miles away . Biologists were dumbfounded , since the birds are still learning how far they can go . They were six months to two years old when released . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They can really take you for a ride , " says field technician Dan Brunetti , 25 , one of several biologists who track the condors ' movements like tornado-watchers chase twisters . <p> It 's a high-tech game of hide-and-seek . Implanted in the birds ' wings and tails are tiny radio transmitters , each with its own frequency so biologists with hand-held receivers and antennas can track them from up to 30 miles away . The chase is n't just for research . The biologists are looking out from afar for the condors ' welfare . <p> " We want to make sure the birds are n't interacting with people , " explains Vekasy , who says condors are so curious and social that if one goes for human hand-outs , others who see it will follow . <p> That 's what doomed Condor 26 . She was captured and returned to captivity this summer after three encounters with humans . The third time , construction workers were feeding her road-killed rabbits . Condor 24 turned up unexpectedly a month ago at Grand Canyon 's South Rim , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in weeks and was recaptured for rehabilitation in a condor breeding center in San Diego . She 's due to return to the wild this fall . <p> Two other condors have died , one from a freakish stab of a golden eagle 's talon in a rare fight , the other in a collision with high-tension power lines near Page . The remaining 11 still roost on the rust-red cliffs and soar over a vast desert wilderness where their Pleistocene ancestors once dined on mastodon . Today 's birds get by on less exotic fare : calf carcasses left out at various sites after dark by condor biologists . Occasionally , they have found other dead animals on their own , a remarkable feat since condors in the wild learn survival skills from their parents . <p> " This is like a foster program with no parents , " says Chris Parish , an Arizona Game and Fish Department staffer who helps in the field . <p> Since the older birds remain in captivity to propagate the species , " there 's nothing really for them to key on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and learn from the actions of other wild scavengers such as ravens , eagles and coyotes . Although biologists are committed to 5 , 10 , even 20 years of recovery work here , they ca n't continue leaving out dead calves forever . <p> " They will get increasingly wilder if they are allowed to , " says Lloyd Kiff , the Peregrine Fund 's science director and a former condor biologist in California . " But if someone 's giving a bird a hot dog in a campground , that can ruin its behavior . " <p> Adds Vekasy : " The hard thing is , you need to be patient with the birds . You just have to understand that they do n't really know what they 're doing yet , and we have to help them along . " <p> The species ' survival plan is ambitious . It would establish three separate populations of at least 150 birds each within the next 10 years . Each would include at least 15 breeding pairs , hatching enough chicks annually to sustain themselves without further human help . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Southern California wilds and 11 here in Arizona . <p> Critics say the costly project ( $ 1.5 million a year ) is a waste on a hopeless case and that " wild " condors should be allowed to run their course . Mesta and others argue that humans must try to save the condor because humans caused the species ' decline through shooting , poisoning and crowding them out of habitat with development and dangerous structures such as power lines . <p> A more immediate acid test will come in another three to four years , when Arizona 's juvenile condors reach breeding age . <p> " When we get our first condor breeding in the wild , " Mesta says , " we will know we have crossed that bridge . It 's the ultimate signal that this bird is going to recover on its own . "
