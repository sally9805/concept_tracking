West African diplomat gives color and credibility to top position at world peacekeeping organization // THE revving sound continues to reverberate in his head . And even now , Kofi Annan finds it hard to fathom why a gang of motorcycle-mounted photographers chased him through the streets of Florence , Italy , earlier this year . It 's not like he was a movie star or a basketball icon-he was " only " the secretary-general of the United Nations on his way to church . When did career diplomats become a part of the paparazzi 's hit list anyway ? Well , they 're not . But world heroes are . And although Annan denies that he has become a world hero , the first Black UN chief has become one of the world 's most sought-after personalities . Since persuading Iraq 's Saddam Hussein to agree to a settlement that averted a major international crisis , interest in Annan 's position has reached far beyond the handshakes of heads of state . And although the Iraq crisis continues to unfold , he is now known far outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compounds that bound his predecessors . Photograph First Black secretary-general of the United Nations // Today , he is recognized wherever he goes . Mamas and daddies now want his autograph for their children , wives of servicemen want to hug him , grandmas want to kiss him , and-perhaps the most telling sign that his life has changed forever-grade-school students are choosing him as the subject of their current-events reports . For Annan , it means no more solitary walks in the woods , no more indistinct travels around New York City , no more low-key visits to his West African homeland of Ghana . " Now those days are gone , " Annan says resigningly as he sits in his office atop the UN 's New York City headquarters . " My life changed when I became secretary-general . And since Iraq , one is easily recognized regardless of where one is ... It 's a new experience for me . " Annan follows in the footsteps of such Black diplomatic giants as Ralph Bunche , a former Howard University professor who helped organize the UN in 1945 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Nobel Peace prize in 1950 for successfully negotiating a historic truce in the 1949 Arab-Israeli conflict . Like Bunche , Annan 's keen negotiating skills have garnered global praise . Few gave Annan a chance when he left for Iraq in February with hopes of settling a disagreement over the search of eight Iraqi sites for weapons . Preparing for a U.S.-led military strike , President Bill Clinton had ordered the positioning of warships in the Persian Gulf . Missiles were aimed . Targets locked in . Iraqi women and children had taken shelter , expecting showers of missiles to rain down on them at any moment . With neither side budging , Annan headed to Baghdad to meet with Saddam Hussein , the world 's most criticized dictator . How could Annan-perhaps the most soft-spoken of the six previous **31;702;TOOLONG negotiate with a man some considered to be mad ? But while others doubted him , Annan was optimistic . " In all the negotiations , I try to go into it with positive expectations that I 'm going to give it my best , and try to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the international community , " he says with a calm so cool that it comes across as complete confidence . " In my job , I need to be optimistic , hopeful and persistent . Otherwise , I will lose heart . " After days of negotiations with Hussein 's underlings , it was heart that led Annan deep inside Hussein 's palace bunker on the bank of the Tigris River , and it was heart that brought him out-three hours after meeting alone with the Iraqi leader-with a signed agreement in hand . " We have been able to demonstrate that if given the chance the UN can make a difference between peace and war by what we did in Iraq , " says Annan , who was praised for his ability to effectively handle the spectrum interests and egos that sabotaged previous negotiations . " Reaching an agreement was important in the sense that it demonstrated that diplomacy , handled carefully , and backed up with fairness and the threat of force , can make a difference . That war would have been devastating for the entire region @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaffirmed the position of the UN , it reaffirmed the role of diplomacy , and , personally , also gave me a chance to play a role . " In his wildest dreams , Annan never thought he would be playing such a role - leading the UN into the 21st century . He grew up in Ghana in the ' ' 50s , during a time when Blacks were struggling for basic human rights . The country had been under British rule for more than a century before protests and demonstrations by Blacks brought about its independence in 1957 . " There was a lot of political activity , and you could feel the political electricity . A lot of important changes were taking place , " says Annan , who was raised in a prominent family , his father serving as the governor of the Ashanti Province and hereditary paramount chief of the Fante people . " The students and young people were very much aware and very engaged . We used to debate in schools , talk about the changes , the end of colonialism , what independence meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aware and active . " Photograph Touching bases with major world leaders // Annan experienced the same activist atmosphere when he moved to the United States in 1959 to attend college . Enrolled in Minnesota 's Macalester College on a Ford Foundation scholarship , he saw a similar freedom movement unfolding in America . " Blacks here were going through the same things that we had been through , " he says . " So I knew what was happening . " He graduated in 1961 with a degree in economics , and received a master 's degree in management from MIT in 1972 . By then , he had begun his career at the UN , where , outside of a break in the mid- ' ' 70s when he went back to Ghana , he has worked for the last three decades . During his 33-year stint at the UN , Annan held positions as personnel director , budget director , comptroller and undersecretary of peacekeeping operations . As undersecretary , Annan was given high marks for his practical approach to carrying out a number of sensitive diplomatic assignments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Iraq following that country 's invasion of Kuwait in 1990 . In less than five years , Annan transformed what was a tiny peacekeeping office into a division of the UN that was managing 75,000 troops from more than 70 countries on 19 separate missions . But even with all of his achievements , succeeding Egypt 's Boutros Boutros-Ghali to become secretarygeneral last year came as a surprise to Annan . " I could never have guessed it . Even joining the UN was an accident . I thought I would stay with the UN for about two years and go back to Ghana and work there , " says Annan , whose fluency in English , French and several African languages helped him move up the ranks at the UN . " But I could never have dreamt that I could have become the secretary-general , even though in career terms I had done quite well and moved up . But no staff member , no member of the secretariat had ever become secretarygeneral , so that was something that was really not in the plans . It happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became secretarygeneral , he and his wife , Nane Lagergren , moved from their middle-class home on New York City 's Roosevelt Island to the secretary-general 's official residence on posh Sutton Place on the other-nd more expensive-side of the Hudson River . For lunch , Annan is usually whisked away-in a police-escorted armored Mercedes-to his nearby estate home for a quick meal with his wife . On nice days , the couple eats in the garden . There 's a deafening quietness that fills the home , the only noise being the intermingling of her Swedish accent with his West African dialect . It 's just the two of them . It 's been that way since their son and two daughters ( from previous marriages ) grew up and moved out . It 's the second marriage for Annan , whose marriage to his first wife , a Nigerian , ended in divorce . Photograph // Those close to the couple reportedly say that the two are soul mates . Both love to travel , read , take long walks in the woods , and share other interests . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You miss friends , you miss family , " the secretary-general says of his homeland . " Now when I go home , the private moments you spend with them are diminished . You miss that . " Nane Lagergren is a lawyer-turnedartist , and the niece of the late Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg , a World War II hero who disappeared in a Soviet prison after saving 20,000 Hungarian Jews from the Nazis . On this day , the two discuss Kofi Annan 's work schedule , which typically includes hosting foreign dignitaries , and attending a host of council meetings , special sessions , ceremonies and receptions . But most days are n't typical . Annan usually finds himself putting out fires , either internally at the UN , or internationally from the seemingly daily conflicts that arise across the world . From India 's nuclear testing to the continued strife between Israel and Palestine , and conflicts in Burundi , Afghanistan , Somalia and Rwanda , Annan and the UN have , and will continue to have , their plates full . " We are trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Annan says . " After the Cold War we knew we were going to go through a period of adjustment and destabilization , but the past year has been incredible . The number of crises which has exploded around us has kept the organization extremely busy and also underscored the point that the UN is needed today perhaps more than ever . " Annan 's election to a five-year term was spurred largely by the United States ' dissatisfaction with BoutrosGhali . Congress was so upset with the performance of the UN that during the past decade , it has sporadically withheld payment of its yearly dues to the organization . As UN leader , Annan 's first goal has been to attempt to restore credibility to the organization . He has trimmed the UN 's staff of 9,000 civil servants working around the world , and re-focused its mission . His goal : Convince the 185-member states that the UN can work . " I think it 's gone quite well , " he says . " It 's been quite a tough period . We have been able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ betterment of the UN and successful peacekeeping missions , like his negotiations coup in Iraq , will convince the United States to pay its past debt , now totaling about $1.5 billion . Successful in pumping credibility , life and color into a previously lackluster UN , Annan is looking forward to the challenges that lie ahead , and understands how important his success is to Black people worldwide . " I know that my position and my role is an inspiration to most of the people on the continent of Africa and Black people everywhere , " he says . " I 'm conscious of the fact that I 'm seen as a role model and that what I 'm doing is inspiring quite a lot of young people not to put any limitations on their own dreams and on their own ambitions . I 'm happy that I 'm able to inspire them that way , to really aim high and live their lives to the fullest without any inhibition about what they can do or be allowed to do ... Eleanor Roosevelt once said , No one can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are words to live by . " Photograph Looking to the future , Annan greets schoolchildren visiting the UN 's New York City headquarters . He has brought a more open , relaxed style of leadership to the organization 's top post .
