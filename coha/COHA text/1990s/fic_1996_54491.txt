The Church basement was warm and garlicky . Long tables stretched the length of the room ; kids ran up and down the rows , yelling ; an old lady who reminded him of his grandma sat at a card table and took people 's money . <p> Ziv Matusec tilted a chair against a table to save the place , and got in line . Up ahead , past the murmurs of a pair of old ladies and the whines of a bunch of kids , a woman 's voice called , " Hi , Chef Gio ! " Ziv saw a bright-eyed man look up from ladling spaghetti sauce and grin at someone in a pink sweater . " Hi , Annie ! Good to see my best customer ! " <p> " Yeah ! I love spaghetti , Chef Gio ! " <p> " I know you do , Annie . " The chef smiled at her like you 'd smile at a cute kid . <p> When he got through the line , Ziv saw that his place was taken . Once , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given the guy a dirty look . Now he took the first empty seat he saw , setting his tray on the scarred Masonite table and dumping his backpack on the floor . When he dropped into the folding chair , he found a steel column against his elbow . <p> Someone across from him giggled . It was the girl in the pink sweater . " That 's not a good seat , " she said smugly . " No one takes those seats against the poles . This is a good seat , see ? I always get a good seat . " <p> She sounded like a kid , but she was n't one . In her early twenties , maybe . Straight brown hair , pale skin  --  kind of ordinary , except for something odd about her expression . <p> " I come here every Friday , " she said , cutting her spaghetti into inch-long pieces . <p> It was exciting to talk to a stranger ! Annie could hardly believe her luck . " I come here every Friday , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut , and raised a forkful cautiously to her mouth . <p> The man across from her mumbled something and twirled his spaghetti on his fork . He did n't get sauce on his shirt . Maybe if she practiced , she could learn to eat spaghetti that way , too . At the workshop , they said if you practiced , you could learn almost anything . <p> " You know what I do ? " she said . <p> He sighed . " No , what do you do ? " <p> " I work ! " <p> " Really ? " <p> " I really do . I 'm a Plant Lady . " <p> " A wha ? " he said into his coffee . <p> " A Plant Lady . I go to all the plants in a big building and water them and wash them and pick off their dead leaves . " She found her card and showed it to him . " See ? " <p> " ' Plant People , ' " he read aloud . " ' Specializing in the Office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " ' Anne Bowles . ' That 's you , right ? " <p> " That 's me . " She put the card away in her red purse . " I go on the bus in the morning and then they take us to the buildings . I go on Monday , Tuesday , Thursday , Friday . " She raised a finger for each day . " Not the other days . I go to the bus stop at seven o'clock . " <p> " Pretty early . " <p> " I have a watch , see ? " She held up her wrist ; the watch was blue plastic , and digital . " When it says seven oh oh , then I go . " <p> " When it says seven oh one , then you run , " he told her . <p> She stared for a minute , then laughed suddenly . " When it says seven oh two , then . . . " <p> " Then you 're through . " <p> " Oh , you 're good , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  only Jimmie 's that good at rhymes . " She checked to see if there was any milk left in her carton , but the straw made a slooping noise , so she drank her coffee instead . <p> The man had finished his . " They give seconds on coffee ? " he asked . <p> Annie jumped up . " I 'll show you . " She led him to the big urn and showed him how the little handle worked . <p> On the way back , they passed a baby in a high chair . He had brown skin and fuzzy dark hair and little white tennis shoes . Annie smiled at him . He smiled back , and spaghetti fell out of his mouth . Annie felt a feeling as if her arms were reaching out . <p> " I used to work at a workshop , " she said , when they were sitting again . " But I like being a Plant Lady better . " She sipped her coffee . " What do you do ? " she asked . It came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " she asked again , just to hear herself . <p> He took a bite of his cake . " I study , " he said with his mouth full . <p> " Oh . " She tilted her head and looked at him . " What do you study ? " <p> He bent across the table towards her and ruffled up his hair with his fingers . " I 'm an alien  --  from outer space ! I study Earth people . " <p> She jumped . " You scared me . That 's not nice . " <p> " Sorry . " He slumped back in his chair . <p> She looked at him again , but he looked just like a regular person in jeans and a blue shirt . " What 's your name ? " <p> " Ziv . Ever hear it before ? It 's an alien name ! " <p> Actually , it had been his uncle 's name . Ziv did n't know why he 'd told this retard he was an alien . He just did n't want to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long ago , he 'd had a regular job , and a car , and an apartment . Lose the job , lose ' em all . <p> Now she was looking at him . God , she was trying to figure out whether to believe him ! <p> " Are you fooling me ? " she asked . <p> " Would I do that ? " <p> " I do n't know . Sometimes people try to fool me . " <p> A small poke of guilt annoyed Ziv and he set his jaw . " I 'm from outer space . " <p> " Really and truly , cross your heart and hope to die ? " <p> " Yeah , yeah . Look , they 're shoving us out . Where 's the john around here ? " <p> " It 's next to the door . Do you have to go ? I do n't , ' cause I went before , and I can go again at home . " <p> " Oh  --  yeah . " He stood up and shrugged himself into his jacket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raincoat , sliding her red purse onto her shoulder . <p> " Look , you wait for me here . And I 'll walk you home , okay ? " <p> " Sure , Ziv ! " <p> He hurried in the men 's room , unsure whether Annie might wander off without him . Too many people here , anyway ; he could n't strip to the waist and wash , the way he wanted to . <p> She looked clean and neat . Did she live with her family ? If she did , why did she go to church dinners by herself ? <p> If she lived alone , he could maybe get a night under a roof . He was smiling when he stepped out to join her . As they walked along St. Clair Avenue , he pumped her about her life . She lived in an apartment . She said " an apartment ! " as if it was something important . But then she wriggled back to the topic of aliens , and Ziv realized with a start that she was trying to pump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> " By space ship , of course . Look , this apartment , what kind of place is it ? " <p> " It 's nice . What 's the space ship look like ? Is it long and skinny , or is it one of the round ones ? " <p> " Round . Kind of like a saucer . Who owns the building ? " <p> " What building ? " <p> " The one you live in ! " <p> " Do n't yell . At the workshop , they said nice people do n't yell unless they 're playing a game . " <p> When they got to the building , it looked okay  --  yellow brick , small and square , not too old . Ziv stepped behind Annie into the little lobby and waited while she found her key , then followed her through the door and upstairs into a hall that smelled of pot roast and Lysol . But after turning the key in the lock of apartment 2B , she said , " Thank you for walking me home , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you going to do now ? " <p> " I watch TV , and then I take a shower , and then I brush my teeth , and then I go to bed , " she said . " Do n't you know that ? " <p> " I 'm an alien , remember ? " He felt weak with the allure of her homey agenda . A little TV , hot water , awarm bed . . . " I 'm an alien , how would I know what you do ? " <p> " Are you really an alien ? " she asked . <p> If he told her it was all a gag , she 'd throw him out . No way could he stand to give up this warm , indoors feeling . " Look , " he said . It was hard to talk ; his throat was tight . " Look , how about I stay here , uh , and study Earth people ? " <p> " At night ? " <p> " Sure , I have to know what Earth people do at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what you do . Not even in the daytime ! " <p> " Look , let me come in , okay ? And I 'll tell you . " <p> With a click , the door of the apartment across the hall opened , and a man looked out . Abruptly , Annie pushed her door open . Ziv followed her inside , she shut the door hard behind them . Ziv had caught only a glimpse of gray eyebrows that met in the middle , and a bald brown head . <p> ANNIE THOUGHT Mr. Demahl was scary . He was big and brown and he never smiled . On Sundays , he left the comics from his paper at Annie 's door . But when she met him at the incinerator , shuffling along in his slippers , she always looked down so he would n't see her . <p> She locked the door carefully , and put the key away in her purse . Then she hung her coat on its hanger in the closet , and her purse with it . <p> Then she stepped into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . This was her own apartment , not a group home . The vacuumed blue carpet , the white kitchen counter , the closets with her clothes lined up neatly in them  --  all hers . It was a good feeling . <p> Ziv sat down on the flowered sofa without looking at the apartment . Annie felt a little disappointed . Then Ziv said , " This is nice . This is real nice , Annie , " and she felt better . <p> " Do you have apartments like this where you come from ? " she asked . <p> " Uh , no , " said Ziv . " Our places are different . " He put his hands behind his head and leaned back . " They 're sort of like . . . caves . They have thick walls , and they curve around you , and they 're warm and safe . And no one can come in unless you say so . And no one can take them away from you . No one . " <p> He sounded sad . Annie sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are you going back there soon , Ziv ? " <p> " I 'm not sure , " he said . " I do n't know when I 'll get back . " <p> " Will they pick you up in a spaceship ? " she asked . " Is it fun to fly in space ? " <p> He smiled down at her . Ziv had a nice smile . " Yeah , " he said . " They 'll pick me up , and we 'll go zooming off in space , past all sorts of stars and planets and stuff . <p> Annie thought about the space ship zooming through the night sky . " Past the moon ? " <p> " Yeah . " <p> " Higher than a plane ? " <p> " Sure . Spaceships go way higher than that . " <p> It sounded nice , to fly in space . People on TV sometimes met aliens , but Annie never had before . He looked like a regular person , but his name was Ziv . He was studying Earth people . Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ziv said he would sleep on the sofa . He said he would be quick in the shower , but the TV showed four sets of commercials before he came out , with his hair slicked down and a different shirt on . He was carrying something wet . " I hung some stuff in the bathroom to dry , okay ? You got a hanger for my shirt ? I wrung it out pretty good ; it wo n't drip . " <p> His underwear was hanging all along the shower rod . It made Annie 's shower dark . When she came out , his shirt was on a hanger hooked to the ceiling light in her bedroom . <p> She slept with the damp shirt hanging over her bed . It looked like it was flying . On her sofa was the alien , with her coat spread over him . <p> Ziv worked lunch shift Saturday , feeling clean all over . Clean body , clean hair  --  and he 'd fed coins to a washer and dryer and washed not only his own stuff , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could say he was n't a good roommate . <p> Knowing there was a roof waiting for him at night gave him a full , contented feeling as he plunged frozen fries into grease . Annie was no genius , but after all , a genius would n't let a strange alien sleep on her sofa . And she looked okay . If he was going to be staying with her awhile , well . . . Like his grandma always said , waste is a sin . <p> By the next day , Ziv was settled in , with his own blanket , pillow , and key . <p> Annie liked having Ziv there . She did , really . But he mixed things up . Annie always did her wash on Wednesdays . She always went to the place with the nice man who helped her with the change machine . But Ziv took some of her clothes on Saturday and went to some other place . And then she did n't know how many to count when she was counting her underpants . And he left his blanket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special coffee mug . And he moved her pink mat , the one she kept next to her bed , to the bathroom . <p> But Ziv told her stories about his home , where everyone lived in houses like caves and took rockets instead of cars or buses . She liked his stories . <p> He did n't want her to tell anyone about him , and she did n't like that . She could n't think of anything else to talk about , and people said , " Annie , why are you so quiet ? " <p> Mr. Demahl was looking funny at her lots of times , too . He probably thought she was letting a stranger in her apartment . " Ziv 's not a stranger , " she wanted to tell him . " He 's an alien ! " But she was afraid . Mr. Demahl 's deep voice sounded so fierce . <p> Rachel Quillon was different . She was the manager of the apartment building , and she lived down in apartment 1D . She had gray hair in a bun , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always said Hi when she met her in the hall , vacuuming or dusting or washing the stairs . <p> Sometimes Rachel invited her into her kitchen for a cup of tea . Annie did n't like tea much , but she liked talking to Rachel . <p> " I see you have a friend staying with you , Annie . " <p> " Yes ! " Annie had n't thought of it before , but Ziv was a friend , was n't he ? " His name is Ziv . " <p> " Interesting name . Is he Slovak ? " <p> Annie shook her head . " He 's just Ziv . " She put sugar in her tea and reached for a saltine . <p> " Is Ziv from around here ? " <p> " Uh , no . " <p> " Where is he from , Annie ? " <p> Annie looked down at the table . " He does n't want me to tell . " <p> " Oh . " Rachel sipped her tea . " Annie  --  " She stopped , and did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands flat on the table and leaned toward Annie . " Annie , you do n't have to do what Ziv tells you to . What matters is what you want to do . " <p> Annie thought about that . " I can do what I want . " <p> Rachel sat back . " Exactly . " <p> " Do you know about babies ? " Annie asked . <p> Rachel stood up suddenly , turned to the counter and poured more hot water on her teabag . " I know the basics , " she said . " One end screams and both ends leak . " She leaned against the counter and looked at Annie . " What do you want to know about babies ? " <p> " At the workshop , they taught us a lot . They taught us what to do and what not to do . " <p> " Yes . . . " <p> " But we like to do some of the things they taught us not to do . " <p> " I 'm not surprised . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they said we should n't . " <p> " I tend to agree . Tell me , did they give you any help in this entirely laudable project ? " <p> " What ? " <p> " Did they show you how not to make babies ? Did they give you pills or a something to put inside you ? Anything at all ? " <p> Annie shook her head impatiently . She did n't remember anything like that . " Does it work ? " she asked . <p> " The pills ? " <p> " No , I mean  --  does it work , to make a baby ? The way they said ? " <p> Rachel sat down hard in her chair . " Yes , " she said . " I believe it works . " <p> " Thanks , Rachel ! " <p> That night , Ziv moved the TV to the bedroom . Aliens liked to watch TV in bed , he said . They sat on the bed and watched together . <p> Ziv put his arm around Annie 's back . She liked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put his hand on her boob . The ladies at the workshop called it a breast , but everyone else called it a boob . <p> His hand felt nice . She snuggled into it . She was glad she was wearing her pink nightie . It was pretty , and she liked the slippery way it felt when Ziv rubbed it . <p> Jimmie at the workshop used to like to do that , too . Annie wondered if Ziv would like other things Jimmie had liked . She reached her hand into his lap to try . <p> " Hey ! " <p> Annie snatched her hand back . " I 'm sorry . " <p> " No , no , " he said . " That 's fine , baby . That 's great . You surprised me , is all . " <p> " You like that ? " <p> " Yeah . Yeah , I like it fine . " <p> " Jimmie used to like it , too . " <p> " I bet he did . " <p> The alien was made like Jimmie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liked some of them . She forgot about the TV . Later , Ziv fell asleep . He took up a lot of room in the bed , so Annie moved to the sofa . She lay in the dark and thought about warm , smiley babies . <p> The next afternoon , when Annie came home from work , she could n't find her key . She buzzed her apartment , but no one answered . She banged on the glass door , and after a long time , she saw someone coming down the stairs . It was Mr. Demahl . He looked cross . <p> " What 's wrong , lose your key ? " <p> Annie nodded . <p> " Where 's the guy ? " <p> " What guy ? " <p> " The boyfriend , girl ! The guy been living in your apartment ! " <p> Mr. Demahl was so big and grumpy , Annie was scared . " You know about him ? " <p> " Seen him coming in and out often enough . What else I got to do these days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . He did n't look as mean as he usually did . The wrinkles around his mouth were kind of twisty , like almost a smile . <p> " Please do n't tell anyone , " Annie whispered . <p> Mr. Demahl shrugged . " Afraid he 'll get tossed out ? " <p> " He might get killed ! " said Annie . " If Earth people find out he 's here , they might kill him ! " <p> " Look , you come on downstairs . We 'll get a key from Rachel . " <p> Downstairs , Mr. Demahl knocked on Rachel 's door . His big fist made a loud sound , but he was n't mad . " You got to really bang . She do n't hear too good . This guy , he 's off a space ship ? " <p> Annie felt a little less scared now . " Do n't tell , okay ? " <p> They could hear Rachel coming , slip , slip , slip . <p> " Who said he 's from space ? " Mr. Demahl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " He told me , " Annie said . " Ziv did . " <p> Christ , she could n't even keep hold of her own stuff ! Ziv picked Annie 's apartment key off the stairs . What kind of security could they have if she dropped keys around like that ? <p> " We 'll have to get a new lock , " he told her when he got home that night . <p> " Oh , no , Ziv . Rachel will get me a new key if I ca n't find mine . " <p> " And have keys to this place floating all over the city ? Nab , I 'll get a new lock . " <p> " But Ziv  --  " <p> " Till then , if I 'm not here , you just wait for me , okay ? " <p> " But I want my key ! " <p> " You ca n't have it , " he explained patiently . " You lost it . " <p> She cheered up after a while . He took her out for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't help it , after all . <p> Still , it was a nuisance sharing the apartment with a retard . She wanted everything the same , week in , week out . Wednesdays washing clothes , Saturdays shopping at the Goodwill store , Sunday looking at the comics from that old black guy 's paper . If anything interfered with her routine , she was unhappy . She talked a lot , too , and she squealed at every baby she saw . <p> He checked the papers for cheap places to stay , for better jobs . The old ladies who rented out rooms seemed to want non-smokers with references from six priests . The jobs wanted references from God . <p> He 'd just have to stay here and save his money . <p> One Saturday morning , Annie threw up . Ziv was mad . He told her to clean the floor . Then he went to work . Annie took the garbage to the incinerator and saw Rachel mopping the stairs to the third floor . <p> " I 'm almost done ; how about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Will that make me throw up ? " <p> " I do n't believe so . Have n't you been feeling well ? " <p> " I feel all right now . " <p> " Have you been tired , Annie ? " <p> " I was tired yesterday . I fell asleep . And other days , too . " <p> Rachel dried the steps with a raggedy towel . Then she came down to Annie . " Do you know when your last period was ? " <p> Annie went inside to get her calendar . She showed it to Rachel . Rachel turned the pages back to where the Xs were , and looked serious . She stood her mop and bucket in a corner and led the way down to her apartment . Then she made Annie sit on the sofa to drink her tea . <p> " Do your shoes feel tight , Annie ? Are you sore here ? " Rachel put her hands on her own breasts . <p> Annie nodded . " Am I sick ? " <p> " I think you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the next thing she said was good . " I mean , I think there 's a baby growing inside you . " <p> " Really ? " Annie could feel her mouth stretching into a big smile . " Really ? A baby for me and Ziv ? " <p> Rachel put her hand on Annie 's shoulder . " Do you want a baby ? " <p> " Everyone wants a baby ! " <p> But Annie did n't tell Ziv . She was n't sure why not . <p> Ziv told Annie he 'd changed the lock . " Now , no one can get in our room but us . Is n't that great ? " <p> " Rachel ca n't get in ? " <p> " Nope . " He wished it was true , but locksmiths cost . " I 've got the only key . " <p> " Can I have one ? " <p> " We 'll see , okay ? Maybe next week , if you 're good . " <p> Annie sat down on the sofa . " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't need ' em . " <p> " Tell me a story about your planet , Ziv . " <p> " Now do n't start  --  " <p> " Please ? " <p> " Oh . . . all right , I guess . " He sat down beside her , shoving aside the blanket and pillow . Annie rested her head on his shoulder and he fiddled absently with the front of her blouse . <p> " Well , we do n't have any keys or any locks . Everyone has a warm place to stay , and plenty of food . And if someone needs to stay with a friend for awhile , that 's okay . And everyone walks around in the sunshine and looks at the green sky and the fluffy blue trees and smiles at everyone else . " <p> " And the bell flowers . " <p> " Yeah , flowers that ring like bells in the wind . " He remembered his grandma 's wind chimes . " And we fly up to our moon any time we want to , and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Roller coaster . " Annie sounded sleepy . <p> " Yeah , roller coasters and Ferris wheels and water slides  --  everything like here , only bigger . All lit up with colored lights . All bright and all free for everyone . " <p> " And at night . . . " <p> " At night , we fly home and sleep . And everyone has a house alone . And no one can throw you out . " <p> Annie was asleep . He looked at her with growing dislike . <p> Then one night Annie got a bug for the movies . " The movies , for Christ 's sake ! You know you 'll just sleep through most of it . " <p> " Please , Ziv ? " <p> He was too soft-hearted , that was it . She did fall asleep , of course , right during the car chase . He had to shake her awake for the longwalk home . And tomorrow was Wednesday  --  no work for her , but an early day for him . <p> On the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says I 'm going to have a baby . " <p> " Shit ! " He stopped under a street light to look at her face . " You 're fooling , right ? This is a joke ? " <p> " No , it 's really real ! Are you excited , Ziv ? " <p> " You 'll have to get rid of it , that 's all . " <p> " Get rid of it ? No ! " <p> " Look , I do n't want a baby ! " <p> But she turned stubborn . " I do n't care ! I want a baby ! " <p> He stopped trying to be nice . " Dummy ! Where would we keep a baby , anyhow ? " <p> " Babies are little ! There 's room ! " <p> " How can a retard like you take care of a baby ? " <p> She was crying now . Big baby herself . " You can help , Ziv . You can tell the baby all your stories . It 'll be fun , Ziv @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was proud that he had n't hit her . " Go away , " he said , not loud . <p> " Go away ? Where , Ziv ? " <p> " I do n't care . Just away . " <p> She did n't move . After a minute , Ziv stalked off , but she followed him . He was forced , finally , to wrench himself away and dodge into an alley to lose her . <p> Do her good to be on the streets a night . Find out what it 's like . After a while , Annie gave up looking for him , and he went home . In bed , he stretched and felt himself fill the apartment . His mind wandered to blue trees , and flowers that rang like wind chimes , and he slept . <p> ANNIE LOOKED at her watch under every street light . It said nine-two-oh , and later it said nine-three-oh . It said nine-something for a long time . Then it said ten-some-thing for a long time . <p> She found a hamburger place and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ziv work here ? " she asked , but they did n't know Ziv . <p> She stayed there until they looked at her funny . Then she went outside and started hunting again . " If I have a baby , then I 'm a mother , " she said over and over . " Mothers are n't scared . " <p> Her watch said two-five-two when she curled in a deep church doorway and fell asleep . It said six-three-four when a police officer found her and brought her home , and Rachel tucked her into a yellow bed . <p> When she woke , it was daytime . She heard Rachel 's voice . <p> " It 's her life , " Rachel was saying . " But it 's so hard . " <p> Annie heard a deep bumble . She got out of bed and went into the living room to see who it was . <p> Mr. Demahl was sitting on Rachel 's sofa . <p> " Feeling better ? " Rachel asked . " I 'll get you a cup of tea . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was left alone with Mr. Demahl . She wanted to say , " Come back , Rachel , I do n't want any tea , " but she did n't . <p> Mr. Demahl shifted himself on the sofa . " Sit down , Annie . " <p> Annie sat on a low chair with blue and white stripes . <p> " I hear your man from outer space left you out all night , " said Mr. Demahl . " That was n't very nice of him , now was it ? " <p> Annie thought . No , she decided , it was n't . She was surprised at the thought , because Ziv was a good person . But he had done a bad thing . <p> " You think he should have done that , girl ? " <p> She shook her head . " I did n't like it . " <p> Rachel came in with a tray . It had mugs of tea on it , and a plate of saltines , and sugar and milk and part of a lemon . Mr. Demahl put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her tea . Carefully , Annie spooned sugar into her tea and took a saltine . <p> " So , how about throwing Ziv out ? " Rachel said . <p> Annie breathed in hard and coughed . Rachel had to pat her back . Annie was embarrassed in front of Mr. Demahl . <p> " We did n't get that far , " Mr. Demahl said . " You got to have a little patience , Rachel . " <p> " I do n't , " she said . " I never did . " She put her empty cup on the tray on the coffee table and turned to Annie . " Look , Annie , you have this Ziv in your apartment and a baby on the way . Start with the baby . Do you know it 's going to take a long time , and then it hurts a lot ? Maybe you should n't have the baby , Annie . " <p> " I want the baby . " Annie was sure of that . <p> " You might not be able to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home and take care of the baby . " <p> " I like being a Plant Lady , " Annie said slowly . " But I want the baby . " <p> " You want the baby more than you want to be a Plant Lady ? " <p> This was hard . A baby was a thing you could hold . Being a Plant Lady was different ; you could n't hold it and look at it to see whether it was better than a baby . Then she remembered : she 'd be a mother ! A mother was better than a Plant Lady ! " I want to be a mother , " she said firmly . " I was n't scared in the night . " <p> " No , but  --  " <p> " Mothers are n't scared . I 'm going to be a mother . " <p> Suddenly , Mr. Demahl let out a booming laugh that made Annie jump . " Round one to Annie , " he said . " Baby stays . " <p> Rachel made her lips into a straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She turned back to Annie . " Now , about Ziv . " <p> Mr. Demahl interrupted . " Look , Annie , you do n't have to do nothing you do n't want . " <p> " But you do n't want Ziv staying with you , do you Annie ? " Rachel said . " He has n't behaved well , has he ? And it 's your apartment after all . Your check pays for it , remember . " <p> Annie thought about that . " It 's my apartment . " <p> " Right . " <p> " So I should have the key ? " <p> Rachel blinked . " Right . " <p> " Not Ziv . " <p> " Definitely not Ziv . " Rachel leaned forward and touched Annie 's knee . " Are you going to throw him out ? " <p> The stripes on her chair were like little roads . Annie followed one with her finger . " If I throw him out , will I still have the baby inside me ? " <p> " Yes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ziv 's leaving wo n't change that . " <p> " Then . . . can you throw him out for me , Rachel ? " <p> " No ! " Mr. Demahl said , before Rachel could answer . " You got to do this yourself , girl ! It 's your apartment  --  you 're the boss there . It 's what you say , counts . You want him to go , he goes . You want him to stay , he stays . You decide , and you tell him ! " <p> She was the boss . Not Ziv . Not even . . . She peeked at Rachel , wondering if Rachel could tell what she was thinking . Not even Rachel . Annie was the boss in apartment 2B . It was a staggering thought . <p> " I want to go home . " <p> Upstairs , Annie put Rachel 's key carefully in her pocket . Ziv was at work ; Annie was alone in the apartment . She picked up Ziv 's socks and folded his blanket . She vacuumed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the tub , and the mirror . She washed the toilet with its special brash . She took the pink bucket and the blue-handled mop and mopped the kitchen and bathroom floors with water and good-smelling green stuff . <p> Annie was suddenly very hungry . She opened a can of tuna and made two big tuna salad sandwiches . Then she sat down at her table and ate her sandwiches , looking around at her clean apartment . I 'm the boss here , she thought . <p> Tomorrow she would go to the Plant People store . They would take her to a building , and she would go to all the offices on her list . All day , she would water the plants and take off their dead leaves and make them feel comfortable . " The plants like you , Annie , " a lady at one of the offices had said . <p> She was a good Plant Lady . She was a good apartment cleaner . She practiced saying , " Ziv , I want to talk to you . " When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stand near the door . <p> When Ziv opened the door , Annie was right in front of him . Poor dumb kid , he actually felt some relief to see her after her night out . But he had to move her aside to get into the room . <p> " Ziv , " she said . Her voice sounded peculiar . " Ziv , I want to talk to you . " <p> " Okay , after I get this frying grease outa my hair . " <p> He ran the shower and forgot her until he stepped out of the bathroom with a towel around his hips . " Hey , Annie , how ' bout buying a blue towel or a white one or something ? These pink ones  --  " <p> He stopped . There were people in the room  --  the lady from downstairs and the black guy from across the hall , sitting together on the sofa . He stared at them warily . <p> " Annie needs to talk to you , Ziv , " said the woman . <p> Called him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or , wait  --  some memory of Annie 's talking about her came back to him  --  Rachel , that was it . And the guy was the one Annie called Mr. Demahl . <p> " I 'm kind of occupied right now , " he said , half sarcastic and half worried . " Get your pants on , " said Demahl . " We can wait . " <p> " I got ta work  --  " <p> " Only till two , Wednesdays . " <p> " Look , you been spying on me ? " <p> Demahl shrugged . " Sure . " <p> Ziv 's towel was slipping . He grabbed it and retreated to the bathroom , but he did n't rush , dressing . Let them wait . <p> Eventually , he pasted a salesman smile on his face and stepped out to face them . " Well , " he said , " what can I do for you ? " <p> Annie was standing at the window . She looked at Rachel , and Rachel nodded . " I want to talk to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Any time , Annie . How ' bout some coffee while we talk ? " <p> Before the others could say anything , she had slipped into the kitchen . She 'd be in there awhile , now , counting cups of water , and scoops of coffee . <p> " Okay , what d' you want ? " he said to the two left . <p> Rachel sat up straight and pressed her lips together . Demahl shifted in his seat . " It 's Annie needs to talk to you , not us . But . " He paused and shook his head . " Annie been all excited , having you here . Talks about you a lot . " <p> " Yeah ? " <p> " Says you 're a spaceman . " <p> " She got that wrong . " Ziv kept his voice down . <p> Rachel 's face reminded him of his boss 's when she found a bag of moldy hamburger buns  --  kind of that same wide look around the nostrils . " You come , I understand , from a place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plants that ring in the wind . . . " <p> " Annie remembered all that ? " <p> " What sort of games have you been playing with Annie , Ziv ? " <p> " We know one of ' em , " Demahl put in . <p> " Why did you tell Annie you were from outer space ? " <p> Ziv 's shoulders twisted . " Ah , I do n't know . It started as a gag , kind of . But she liked it , you know ? " <p> " And now she 's pregnant . With your child . " Rachel sounded sick . <p> " Boy , you sure messed up . " Demahl leaned back and the sofa creaked . " What 'd you want to go and do that to Annie for ? " <p> " I did n't know she 'd get knocked up , for Christ 's sake ! How was I supposed to know ? " <p> It was funny , for about two seconds , to see that big old guy and that little lady , both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no place to stay ! I was on the streets ! You know what that 's like ? " <p> " Yeah , " said Demahl . " I been there once or twice . And I did n't lie to no poor dumb kid and then knock her up . " <p> " Well , I did . So sue me . You wo n't make Annie happy that way . " <p> " What way , Ziv ? " It was Annie , with the red plastic tray she 'd bought on their last trip to the Goodwill store . Now it held six mugs  --  four full of coffee , one of milk , and one of sugar . A saucer held cookies . Annie stooped and put it on the end table . <p> " I did n't have any lemon , Rachel . " <p> " That 's fine , Annie . I do n't take lemon in coffee . " <p> " Now should I talk to Ziv ? " <p> Rachel opened her mouth , but Demahl butted in . " Yeah . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ okay ? " <p> " Okay , " said Annie , in a small voice . Then she took a breath , not like a regular person , Ziv thought , but loud and deep . " Okay . " She insisted that he and Rachel take their cups with them . " Take cookies too ! " <p> When they were gone , Ziv relaxed . " Hope they do n't steal the cups . " <p> " Rachel would n't steal . Mr. Demahl would n't steal . They 're good . " <p> " You think everyone 's good . " Ziv dropped into a chair and leaned back with a grin . " You think everyone 's wonderful ! " <p> " I do n't think you 're wonderful , Ziv , " said Annie . <p> Funny , it kind of hurt . With an effort , he smiled . " Not wonderful , maybe , but pretty damn good . " <p> " You 're good . But you do bad things . " <p> " Sure . You do too . Everyone does . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did bad things to me . " She held up one finger at a time . " You left me alone at night , outside . You ate all the raisin bread before I got any . You sleep in my bed and take up all the room . You mess up the bathroom all the time . " She counted . " Four bad things . " <p> She took a breath . " Go away , Ziv , " she said . " Go back to your space ship . " <p> His smile felt tight . " Suppose I do n't want to ? " <p> " I 'll get Mr. Demahl , " said Annie . " He told me to . He said , ' If he wo n't go , you come and get me , you hear ? ' That 's what he said . " <p> Ziv stood up and came close to her . She smelled like coffee and the stuff she cleaned with . He stroked her arm with one finger and watched the hair stand up . " You do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . <p> Now she was crying and she pushed him away . " Yes I do , " she said . " I do n't want you to study me anymore . Go away , Ziv ! " <p> For a crazy minute , Ziv thought of refusing  --  just stay here , see what she 'd do about it . Then he thought of Demahl , and of social workers and county authorities . And babies . God . How 'd he gotten into this in the first place ? " No trouble . I do n't hang around where I 'm not wanted . " <p> He packed carefully , folding shirts and rolling underwear . He still had most of the money he 'd made since coming here , he divided it among his pockets . He took a plastic bag to carry his pillow , threw in soap , and his toothbrush , and a new tube of toothpaste . From the kitchen , he took two loaves of bread and as many cans as he thought he could carry . <p> Annie watched , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came close to her , but she backed away . <p> Ziv glanced around to make sure he had n't forgotten anything . The living room looked as warm and inviting as it had the first night ; the sight pinched . For a moment , he felt as if he could , somehow , have managed better . <p> He opened the apartment door . <p> The two of them were sitting on the steps to the third floor , Rachel leaning against Demahl . She sat up when he came out . <p> " Look , you got a paper ? " Ziv asked Demahl . " I maybe could find a room or something . " <p> Demahl looked gently amazed , but pulled himself up and went into his apartment . He came out with a newspaper and handed it to Ziv . " Thanks . Hey , Rachel ? Can I use you for a reference ? " <p> Rachel opened her mouth , closed it , and opened it again . " Yes , " she said in a strangled voice . <p> ANNIE LEANED @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the bottom , he lifted his bag to his back and opened the inner door . She saw him bend to look into the mailboxes . Then he let the door go . A minute later , she heard the outer door open and close . <p> Annie cried , still leaning over the banister . Rachel patted her back . Then Annie stood up . She robbed her face where the tears itched . " I still have a baby inside , " she said . <p> " Yes , Annie . " <p> Annie sighed . " I remember all Ziv 's stories . " <p> " I know you do . " <p> " I can tell them to the baby , when it comes out . " <p> " Oh , my dear , " said Rachel . <p> " Hush , " said Mr. Demahl . " You tell that baby any stories you want , child . " <p> Annie went into her apartment . She closed the drawers Ziv had left open . She cleaned Ziv 's hairs out of the tub @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living room and laid her pink mat next to the bed . <p> The apartment looked nice . Annie patted the space baby in her tummy .
