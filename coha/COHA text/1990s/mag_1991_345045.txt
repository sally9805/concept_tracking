In Europe , both sides welcomed the attack on Pearl Harbor . Hitler , pleased that the industrial bulwark of the Allies was now preoccupied with an Asian enemy , almost immediately declared war on the U.S. Churchill and Stalin were relieved that America was finally a combatant . <P> By the beginning of December 1941 , German troops were in Istra , a suburb only 15 miles west of Moscow . Ever since Hitler launched Operation Barbarossa at 4 a.m. on June 22 , 1941 , his forces had swept through Stalin 's European empire . They took the half of Poland that had been partitioned to the Soviet Union in 1939 , stripped off the Baltic states that Moscow had annexed just a year before , seized Belorussia , and were marching south into Ukraine . Stalin 's generals were stunned . They had believed the idea of blitzkrieg was an unreliable bourgeois strategy . No one had expected such a lightning conquest . <P> By Oct. 16 Germans were 60 miles from Moscow , and the capital was in a panic . Muscovites were stampeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into trucks , huddled in carts . By the end of the month , 2 million had evacuated eastward in what the Soviets still call " the big skedaddle . " <P> In spite of what seemed to be inevitable doom , in spite of hundreds of thousands of fleeing party apparatchiks , Stalin remained in Moscow . In a speech on Nov. 6 , 1941 , the eve of the 24th anniversary of the Bolshevik takeover , he cast the enemy as beasts . " It is these people without honor or conscience , these people with the morality of animals , who have the effrontery to call for the extermination of the great Russian nation . " Patriotic Russians would never let that happen . " No mercy for the German invaders , " he said . In Red Square the next day , he again sought to rein in the panic and rally the country . Under a sky ringed with antiaircraft blimps , with artillery fire echoing and under constant threat of Luftwaffe attack , the Soviet leader evoked the glories of Russia 's heroic past  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , included Lenin in this pantheon . " The enemy is at the gates of Moscow and Leningrad , " he said . " The war you are waging is a war of liberation , a just war . " He thundered , " May you be blessed by great Lenin 's victorious banner . Death to the German invaders . . . Onward to victory ! " <P> The tyrant 's appeal transfigured a shell-shocked country . Suddenly a hopeless cause became the Great Patriotic War . Even those who hated Stalin  --  like the novelist Victor Nekrasov  --  remember rushing into combat crying " Za rodinu , za Stalina ! " ( For the motherland , for Stalin ! ) . The reanimated Russians could also count on a perennial ally : Father Winter .
