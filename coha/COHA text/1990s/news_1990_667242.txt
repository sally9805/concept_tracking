<p> Today : Jazz , soul and country music , 6D. - Friday : Movies . Much is being made of rap 's breakthrough in 1990 . And the year 's domination by dance pop . And the further decline of rock ' n ' roll . <p> Not so fast . <p> It 's true that rap sales climbed into the stratosphere , but the biggest number boosts came from the tepid pop-tailored albums of riff coppers M.C. Hammer and Vanilla Ice , not exactly rap 's cutting edge . Meanwhile , true innovators like A Tribe Called Quest and the Jungle Brothers and mean-streets commentators like the Geto Boys and N.W.A. struggled for exposure . Tame rap became ubiquitous , resulting in such grating hits as Bart Simpson 's Do the Bartman . But the year 's best rap album , Public Enemy 's Fear of a Black Planet , deserved far greater prominence on radio and charts . And as long as self-appointed moral guardians continue to press for legal harassment of black rappers , the jury on rap 's rock-solid status is still out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But signs indicate that producer- machined neo-disco could be losing its charms , at least for fans who like their music honest . While Milli Vanilli 's hocus-pocus backfired and may have left them careerless , other acts - like Technotronic and Black Box - were caught in similar vocal fake-outs . <p> As for rock losing steam , look again . Besides entries on the following list , ZZ Top returned with Recycler , killer rock with a blues undertow . Robert Plant revived his Zep appeal with Manic Nirvana . And one of the year 's best new bands , Atlanta 's Black Crowes , garnered raves with their early- Stones bar-band abandon . True , rock did n't ignite the charts , and some of the worthiest efforts ( Peter Wolf 's Up to No Good , for instance ) died in infancy . But the year produced enough uncompromising rock ' n ' roll to inspire hope for the ' 90s . <p> The year 's 10 best albums : 1 . Neil Young , Ragged Glory - Last year , Young 's classic Freedom topped this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spontaneous , wantonly uncommercial blast of guitar-wailing garage rock . With Young around , rock ' n ' roll will never die . <p> 2 . Sinead O'Connor , I Do Not Want What I Have n't Got - " You asked for the truth and I told you , " sings this wondrous Irish songbird on the year 's most transfixingly beautiful musical diary . Her voice swoops , howls and glides , racing into hairpin turns ; her songs , though often emotionally scalding , offer cathartic uplifts . <p> 3 . Public Enemy , Fear of a Black Planet - With stinging , rapid-fire essays and sonic booms , P.E . ' s pro-black agenda encourages social and political involvement to tackle a society poisoned by racism . Dense rhythms , buzz-saw racket and convulsive melodies are built from snippets of reggae , funk , soul , rock and agitated voices . The best songs address black stereotypes in films ( Burn Hollywood Burn ) , interracial romance ( Pollywanacraka ) , inadequate medical services ( 911 Is a Joke ) and black feminism ( Revolutionary Generation ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced , arranged and composed ( with assists ) 17 winning songs that capitalize on his trademarks : funk grooves , grinding guitars , baroque instrumentation , sex-and-religion studies , emotive vocals that soar to a shimmering falsetto . Solid R &B; is dressed in buoyant Beatlesque melodies , rock , psychedelia and blues . Some moments seem familiar : Ca n't Stop This Feeling I Got is this year 's Let 's Go Crazy . And the title track recalls Purple Rain . He coaxes the Time 's best work ever in Shake ! and Release It . <p> 5 . Living Colour , Time 's Up - The New York quartet kicks through the walls of established hard rock , incorporating jazz , funk and reggae into their powerful and complex brand of intellectual metal . The lyrics are as smart and challenging as the music . Time 's Up addresses the decaying planet , Pride looks at racial stereotypes , Love Rears Its Ugly Head examines the dread that accompanies the thrill of falling in love , and Elvis Is Dead , with cameos by Little Richard and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ king of rock . <p> 6 . The Traveling Wilburys , Vol. 3 - Bob Dylan , George Harrison , Tom Petty and Jeff Lynne convene under whimsical aliases to strike out on the year 's happiest trail , a heartfelt batch of spontaneous rock ' n ' roll . The band 's sophomore album revives the self-effacing humor , relaxed charm and rootsy rock of the debut . Chief vocalist and lyricist Bob Dylan is the standout , especially on 7 Deadly Sins and If You Belonged to Me . <p> 7 . Paul Simon , The Rhythm of the Saints - Simon 's newest Third World adventure is a dreamy , rhythm-crazed transcultural landmark , if a little too controlled and devoid of the playful humor and warmth that graced 1986 's masterly Graceland . Grabby Brazilian drum beats and exotic West African guitar join tidy melodies and feathery vocals on Simonized wonders like The Cool , Cool River , She Moves On and Ca n't Run But . Best track : The Obvious Child , given an itchy pulse by Olodum , a 14-piece Brazilian drum group . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - This ai n't no party , this ai n't no disco . It 's a bleak , furious journey through desperation to catharsis , more depressing than Mould 's solo debut , Workbook , but also more rewarding . The angry assaults of feedback and distortion suit the post-punk sentiments . " A little pain never killed anyone , " he sings on Hanging Tree . Here , pain is a welcome antidote for today 's pop anesthetics . <p> 9 . Los Lobos , The Neighborhood - The rollicking Tex-Mex outfit that resurrected La Bamba proves again that retooling a Mexican folk song into infectious pop is only one of its many talents . Never a sloppy patchwork , the Lobos ' rock-mariachi blend is unusually pure and earthy , from the joyous kick of Jenny 's Got a Pony to the hymnal grace of The Giving Tree . <p> 10 . Robert Cray , Midnight Stroll - The young lion of the blues enlists the Memphis Horns to flesh out his updated classic R &B,; rife with supple guitar solos and Cray 's strongest singing yet , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pain ) . Everything sounds fresh , from the chugging blues of These Things to the soul revival of Consequences . <p> Other noteworthy 1990 LPs : the Replacements , All Shook Down ; Van Morrison , Enlightenment ; George Michael , Listen Without Prejudice Vol. 1 ; World Party , Goodbye Jumbo ; Sonic Youth , Goo ; and Boo-Yaa T.R.I.B.E. , New Funky Nation . <p> CUTLINE : YOUNG : He was doing rock right in the 1970s and has n't lost his musical momentum in the ' 90s , evident on ' Ragged Glory . ' CUTLINE : LIVING COLOUR : The genre-melding group , from left , Will Calhoun , Corey Glover , Muzz Skillings and Vernon Reid , earned a reputation as innovators with smart , challenging music and lyrics . CUTLINE : O'CONNOR : Pours on the heat with her scalding songs CUTLINE : PRINCE : ' Graffiti Bridge ' glows with signature sounds .
