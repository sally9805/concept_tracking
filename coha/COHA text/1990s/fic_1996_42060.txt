SHE DOES N'T KNOW I 'm her father . In fact , her father does n't know I 'm her father . I mean , the man married to her mother does n't know . He thinks Frannie is his . <p> We 've all been friends for a long time . Frannie used to call me Uncle Stan . Now she 's Francine , and I 'm just Stan . <p> She called yesterday to say she needed to talk to me . I suggested lunch . <p> So we sit here , silent behind leather-bound menus . She does n't ask me to translate the French anymore , the way she did three years ago . Now she knows what Canard aux pommes and Sorbet citron yert are . She asks what I recommend . Try the crabes mous , I tease , and Frannie laughs . The last time we were here , I offered her a bit of my soft-shell crab . Oooh gross , she said . <p> Her mother does n't know she called me , and neither does her father . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laments . They do n't understand her . I try to curb my sympathy . <p> She is sixteen . Sixteen . I suppose most men would say , Where has the time gone ? But not me ; I know where it has gone . Ask any exile . He will tell you where the time has gone . <p> And it 's worse when one is exiled so near to home and happiness . In return for my silence over all these years-and what would have been the point of saying anything once she decided to stay with her husband  --  Frannie 's mother has slipped me the odd invitation to a ballet recital or birthday party , to a barbecue or graduation . Bur . it 's like being a ghost and watching someone else living your life for you . Joe 's a nice guy ; we 're friends , in fact . But he 's the one Frannie calls Dad . He 's the one who goes upstairs with Meg after the party 's over . <p> Her parents wo n't let her go skiing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys on the trip , but if all she wanted to do was to sleep with someone , she would n't have to go all the way to Vermont to do it . I pale a bit . Her parents just do n't trust her , she declares . <p> She pouts just like her mother . I try to be understanding , but I , too , am horrified at the idea of her spending a weekend in the mountains with  --  the term sticks in my throat  --  boys . I mention AIDS , but I do n't know if I 'm trying to protect her or just trying to keep her out of the clutches of those pimply adolescents . She reaches across the table to give me an affectionate , condescending pat on my hand that scares me to death . I remember what I thought of talks like this one when I was a teenager . I try again , telling her about the guy in my building who 's dying of AIDS . She grows impatient with me , saying she and her friends know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she adds ominously . <p> But this is not what she wants to talk about . It 's not why she called me . I prod her a bit , and she says that she does n't know if she should be talking about it at all , but she had to speak to someone . I nod . <p> Her parents , she whispers , are getting a divorce . They have n't told her yet , but she overheard them arguing a few nights ago . <p> I am shocked . I have n't heard anything about this from either one of them . I ask if she is sure . <p> Her mother told her father he only had to wait another two year  --  still Frannie was in college-and it would all be over . Then he could run away to Tahiti with his damned secretary for all she cared . <p> Frannie seems more curious than concerned , but I 've learned what deep rivers her feelings can be . Three or four summers ago , we all met for a weekend at the shore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading magazines and laughing at a little kid who was chasing seagulls , when she suddenly turned to me and asked if I had ever wanted to kill myself . That night , worried , I mentioned it to her mother , who explained that one of Frannie 's teachers had committed suicide during the Christmas holidays . It 's all underground , her mother sighed , it 's always been that way with her . All of a sudden , you find out she 's been thinking about something for months , but it 's the first you hear about it . <p> That 's the way it always was with her mother , too , remember . It occurs to me that this whole thing about getting a divorce when Frannie goes away to school may be one more example of it , in fact . I can imagine Joe standing there , probably in the kitchen , in the middle of an argument with Meg , when she suddenly explains that , yes , of course they 're getting divorced in two years . He asks what in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back at him with those huge eyes of hers as if this is something they agreed on long ago-does n't he remember ? No doubt it 's the first time he 's hearing of it , but that wo n't make any difference . He 's done for . <p> I 'm like that android on television . My head jerks just the slightest bit to the right as if I 'm trying to find something in my memory banks , searching for some routine programmed years ago to be activated at an unspecified date in the future when Meg again became a possibility . <p> So what should she do , Frannie asks , trying to get a piece of lettuce into her mouth . <p> I stop myself from telling her to cut her food . Instead , I smile reassuringly . People say stuff like that all the time , I promise her . It 's nothing to worry about . <p> She is certain I would n't divorce my wife  --  if I had one . <p> That 's true , I agree , but sometimes love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at sixteen , she already knows I am right about that . Crunching her salad , she wonders if I have ever been in love . <p> Once , I answer , staring at my plate . <p> She puts down her fork and demands the details . <p> I 'm noncommittal . It was long ago . It did n't last . Yes , the woman was beautiful , but it did n't last . <p> Frannie wants to know why . Did she love someone else <p> I shrug . <p> Frannie sees I 'm not going to tell her anything about it and , with a little smirk , goes back to her salad . <p> I was telling the truth . I do n't know whether Megan loved her husband back then or not . That last time we were together , when she was sure about the baby , she told me she could n't bring herself to hurt Joe . I guess that 's love  --  not wanting to hurt somebody  --  though I told myself at the time it was nothing but pity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know if they had anything to do with Joe or me . <p> Frannie asks about Paris . I go there once or twice a year on business . She wants to know about my favorite place in the city . <p> There is a fountain , I tell her , a huge pool really , in the Tuileries gardens , and every evening about five , all the mothers in the neighborhood take the kids there to wait for their papas coming home from work . The children rent red and blue sailboats from an old man , and the pool fills with a Aotilla of little sloops , heeling in the evening breeze . One by one , the fathers arrive in their impeccable suits , copies of Le Monde tucked under their arms , and sit beside their wives on the wrought-iron benches and green chairs of the dusty park . In half an hour they 're all gone , off to their homes for a dinner of onion soup and soft-shell crabs , I say wistfully , and then smile . <p> Frannie overflows with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting alone in the darkening gardens as the old goat-faced vendor gathers up his sailboats . <p> Goat-faced ? <p> She made that up , she concedes , and reminds me about my promise to take her to Paris one day . Then we could sit in the park together at twilight , and I would n't be alone . <p> I have n't forgotten , I assure her . <p> Maybe if her parents get divorced , we could move there , she suggests , forever . <p> She 's still a little girl , I realize . She makes me agree at least to think about it . <p> Where will we eat , she wants to know , when we move there I know better than to permit myself fantasies about a shared life with my daughter . But she wants to pretend , and I have never been able to disappoint her . In a couscouserie , I tell her . <p> I wait for her to ask what that is , and then I explain about Algeria and colonialism and couscous . I promise she will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will cook for me each night-after we get home from the Tuileries . When I ask what she knows how to cook , she tells me lasagna . And chocolate chip cookies , she adds . <p> She explains how we will take trips through the countryside . For some reason  --  a photograph in her French textbook , I guess  --  she wants to go to Lyon . And Nice , to go swimming , she remembers . <p> It all sounds lovely and childish , and I smile indulgently as my daughter unfurls her secret plan until I realize that is pretty much the way I have imagined life with her and her mother all these years . Lasagna and chocolate chip cookies and Nice , to go swimming . <p> So what do I think , she wants to know . <p> I think I really am that pathetic figure sitting in the darkening gardens with the old goat-faced man . Great , I tell her , ' 11 look for an apartment the next time I 'm in Paris . <p> She giggles . I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother , particularly , refuses to take her seriously . Why ca n't adults treat kids with respect , she wants to know . Her mother lies around the house all day and fights with her father all night , then turns around and punishes Frannie for the slightest mistake . It 's not fair , she complains . <p> I try to change the subject , but she is not finished with her mother 's failings . As the anger bubbles out of her , I am hurt by her devotion to her father and her readiness to take his side against her mother . I , on the other hand , have to suppress one excuse after another for her mother 's behavior . It 's hard , I want to tell her , to live for twenty years with someone you do n't love . But , of course , I do n't tell her . I nod . I try to temper her feelings . I soothe her . I get her to admit her mother loves her and she loves her mother . As the entrees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she guesses I 'm right . She just wants to be taken seriously , that 's all . <p> Frannie loves the shrimp . How 's the duck , she wonders , with a sly smile . I dip a large piece in the sauce and let her nibble it from the end of my fork . She blots her lips with the napkin . Good , she says , but not as good as the shrimp . <p> Something occurs to me . Has she ever tasted duck before , I ask . No , never . This is the first time . But it 's good . She likes it . <p> I try to remember the last time I had something for the first time . I ca n't think of anything , other than a few chichi vegetables at some dump in the Village a few months ago . But for Frannie , it 's all new . It 's the Garden at dawn , for her , and everything is waiting for a name . <p> I want to believe that Meg will have me when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am her father and throw her arms around me . But I know it wo n't happen , none of it . Nothing will change . <p> A waiter trundles the silver dessert cart , overflowing with sweets , past our table . Frannie wants to know if she can have two desserts , one chocolate and one something else . It 's an old joke between us , from when she was very small . We 're not finished yet , I object . 6h , Stan , my daughter laughs , you eat too slow . She pops the last shrimp into her mouth . <p> It 's the " Stan " that drives the needle through my heart . I ca n't help myself . I call the waiter back . The young lady will have one of everything on the cart , I tell him . <p> Everything ? Frannie squeals , delighted . She ca n't believe it . <p> I watch her as the cakes and chocolates and strawberries and pies and parfaits are laid before her . Her eyes , her huge eyes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
