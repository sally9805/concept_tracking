There are exceptions , but in general , when a veteran rock ' n ' roller gives a new album his own name , he 's looking to make a career statement . John Mellencamp 's latest album , John Mellencamp ( Columbia ) , is no exception . These are difficult days to be John Mellencamp . Rock is on the run , youth is on the rise , and his brand of rural rock skews a little old even for the VH1 set . But Mellencamp , 47 , is soldiering on , trying to re-establish his name , his image and his music . He has left Mercury Records , his label for some 20 years , and signed with Columbia . He has a new book of artwork out , Mellencamp : Paintings and Reflections ( HarperCollins ; $40 ) . And he 's willing to be unusually candid about almost anything he 's asked . <P> What , for example , does he think about his former label ? " Mercury had a terrible distribution problem , " he says . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk into like the local Target and  --  no stock . " Nor is he fond of Jay Leno 's Tonight Show : " I was on that show once and it was like , ' Ahhhh ! This is brain damage ! ' " And like many of the ordinary folks who make up his fan base , he 's fed up with the situation in Washington . " I do n't understand how they got those Clinton grand jury tapes on TV , " he complains . " Where 's Nixon 's tapes at ? Why do n't we hear Nixon 's tapes ? " <P> Mellencamp does n't spare himself either , laughing as he looks back at the evolution of his stage name . He started out Johnny Cougar , became John Cougar Mellencamp , and now goes by his given name . Says Mellencamp : " I do n't know if there 's been a more ridiculous transformation in the history of rock ' n ' roll . " <P> Although he 's made some fine pop albums in the past , notably Scarecrow ( 1985 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says he 's been moving beyond arena-filling pop . " Scarecrow is a square record , " he says . " There 's no countermelodies . Just verse , chorus , verse , chorus , bridge , verse , chorus . Square songs can be the most beautiful songs in the world . But around ' 88 and ' 89 I got tired of making square records . " <P> Mellencamp had a heart attack in 1994 , and as he tours for this record , the thought of his heart giving out is in the back of his mind . Still , he says , he 's happier than he 's ever been . The excesses of his youth , he claims , are gone . The twice-divorced Mellencamp is married again ( to model Elaine Irwin ) , and he says he 's through chasing women . He 's gone from singing pop fluff to voicing , in mid-career , his concern for farmers , small towns and , of late , humankind in general . <P> On his new record Mellencamp is wistful for the past but satisfied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Your Life Is Now , he sings , " Your father 's days are lost to you/ This is your time here to do what you will do . " At the end of an interview , the now comfortably mature rocker leans forward and , with a conspiratorial grin , confides , " Guys are n't worth a f until they 're 40 .
