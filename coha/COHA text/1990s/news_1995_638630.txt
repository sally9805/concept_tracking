<p> Journalistic curiosity can help fill scientific gaps <p> Your recent report on global warming is either journalistic incompetence , scientific ignorance or overt complicity with agenda-scientists . Here is a list of questions the reporter might use the next time he queries an expert on global climatic shifts : <p> If the temperature increase cited ( in this case the South Pacific ) is a full degree centigrade over the last century and half a degree between 1860 and 1900 , why has the increase in temperature decelerated with the acceleration of industrial activity ? <p> Of the " ample evidence " for global warming claimed by the scientists , how much falls above the standard uncertainty ? What is the uncertainty ? If you hear a claim that Earth has heated by 1 degree centigrade , plus or minus 1 degree centigrade , what does this tell you about the speaker ? <p> If sea level has risen 4 tenths of an inch over the last 30 years ( a period which saw a decrease in the claimed rate of temperature increase ) , then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level of no more than 1.3 inches . If 11 percent of glacial melt accounts for 1.3 inches , should n't 100 percent melting bring no more than about a foot rise ? <p> Would a 1-foot rise in sea level be even noticeable ? How much variation exists in present ocean levels over the course of a year ? A decade ? Would n't this minor invasion into a few low-lying areas simply create more marginal wetlands ? <p> Wo n't an expected loss of land surface be more than compensated for by an increase in land surfaces on whole continents now covered by ice ? <p> How can any self-respecting scientist quantify the loss of food production when nothing is known about the climatic shifts which would accompany such an event ? If Kansas is turned into a desert , then perhaps all of Siberia , now useless desert , may become one massive breadbasket . Nobody can or will know until it happens . Anyone claiming otherwise is just yanking your chain . <p> The answers to many of these and an endless list of other questions raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They all indicate that climatic change is an ongoing , normal process . <p> Considering the enormity of the price tag to society of fixing an imaginary problem ( human-caused climatic change ) I would expect at least some journalistic curiosity . <p> KIRK KOFFORD <p> Estes Park <p> Block grants spell disaster for the elderly <p> Congress is seriously considering the creation of Medicaid block grants , with a fixed 5 percent annual growth rate regardless of state-specific trends . While block grants - and their impact on young welfare recipients - have been the focus of extensive debate and analysis , Colorado 's policymakers have focused little attention on how block grants will affect the state 's growing elderly populations . <p> A recent American Health Care Association analysis shows that block grants spell disaster for Colorado 's elderly and their long-term-care needs . <p> The aging of America is real , and it raises difficult issues . Perhaps most difficult : how will our society meet the long-term-care needs of an aging population ? One in four people over age 85 needs long-term care . As baby boomers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grow exponentially . <p> Complicating the issue is the fact that Medicaid currently pays for the care of two out of three nursing home residents . While block grants may look like an attractive way to curb federal and state spending today , in the long run block grants will create fiscal problems he likes of which Colorado 's policymakers have not even imagined . <p> Block grants do n't get to the root of what 's wrong with the nation 's long-term-care system . Congress needs to establish a new national long-term-care program by integrating long-term care into Medicare 's acute- care coverage . Private long-term-care insurance should be the cornerstone of the program allowing the elderly to preserve assets and meet their long-term-care needs . It 's time to recognize that long-term care is part of health care , not welfare . <p> DEBBIE POWELL <p> National Health Care Affiliates Inc . <p> Colorado Regional Director of Operations <p> ' Free ad ' for cigars was irresponsible <p> Do you call the front page of Living news ? The cigar companies and all tobacco industries really must be laughing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - two in color - and all that free information . <p> You should be ashamed to print such trash . <p> VELMA KLEIN <p> Aurora <p> Although the article on the front page of the July 20 " Living " section mentions briefly that smoking is not a healthy thing , the overall tone of the article suggests that cigar smoking is elegant , " in " and glamorous . The point is also made that this activity is new and appeals to the young . <p> The terrible dangers of smoking are common knowledge . Another article on page 21A had the headline of " Smoking among teens jumps sharply in U.S. " How can this be with the lead article in Section E featuring captions : " Cigars lighting fire of a new generation " and " Cigars play a starring role in vacation dinners . " It is highly irresponsible of The Post to feature such an article encouraging cigar smoking . <p> BETTY S. JASON <p> Denver <p> Crippling applied science can hurt us all <p> Thank you for reminding us of the hidden losses to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not supported . When the U.S. Geological Survey lays off 250 researchers and support staff in Denver , then Colorado and the nation will also lose applied science programs that address resources , hazards , environmental issues and earth-science information that can impact us all . <p> The survey has given the nation estimates of infrastructure , mineral-resource and energy resource reserves so industry could plan for orderly development of its financial - and the nation 's natural - resources . <p> U.S. Geological Survey studies of hazards such as landslides , earthquakes , floods and volcanoes have supplied data so community planners could devise safer uses of public or municipal lands . USGS environmental studies of air , water and soil quality have alerted federal , state and local governments to both local and nationwide problems . Survey studies have helped regulators set scientifically defensible cleanup levels . <p> USGS 's sophisticated mapping techniques and products are available to the public in digital form . Scientists , politicians and planners can use this data to understand the interplay of resources , hazards , and the environment of air , water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Above all , the U.S. Geological Survey provided this breadth of information to all in an impartial manner , often at the request of , and funded , by state , local and other federal agencies . As we become more aware of Earth 's complexity , can we afford to cripple the applied-science programs of an agency devoted to sharing that understanding of Earth and its stewardship ? <p> SIGRID ASHER-BOLINDER <p> Denver <p> Who 's in charge at DPS ? <p> The new DPS Board of Education flunked its first test with enactment of next year 's budget . To save money , the Budget Steering Committee recommended eliminating the independent secretary/treasurer and attorney . But the board kept these offices , continuing a structure without accountability . <p> With the DPS attorney and his firm getting half a million dollars annually , the attorney is the chief executive by pay level . Nearly all questions of why ridiculous DPS activities persist get this reply : " The law requires it . " Is the superintendent really in charge ? <p> Board members did respond as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If this is true , why is DPS the only school district with this independent office ? Did the board forget Arthur Andersen 's recommendation to consolidate accounting functions ? <p> " Operating expenses cover such expenditures as are absolutely necessary for the operation of the schools . " DPS Board President Thomas Keely , First Annual Report , Sept. 30 , 1904 , Page 10 . If DPS returns to this standard , Denver voters will provide the funds . Start by appointing a single chief executive . Common sense requires it . <p> PAUL KNUEVEN , CPA and Member , <p> DPS Budget Steering Committee , Denver <p> Newcomers do n't grin <p> The big grin you see on the newcomers ( Fred Brown column of July 11 , " 60% of newcomers to Colorado love it " ) is n't a smile of happiness . It is a sneer and a smirk . <p> Newcomers complain about almost everything . Their contempt of Colorado and their rude remarks and attitude tell us nothing about Colorado is right , so they 're trying to change it to suit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is another Chicago , Los Angeles or Dallas . And they have a lot of help from some developers , Realtors , city and county leaders , elected individuals and some business people . <p> L. REED <p> Denver <p> Hot vote on crossing <p> Your article on the vote in Greenwood Village today ( July 25 ) said voters want to stop new highways from being built across Cherry Creek State Park . Yup , but the article missed a bit . Greenwood Village government swore to kill the Cherry Creek Crossing highway , then signed a contract with commercial folks which kept the highway alive for 10 to 20 years . If government and special interests do n't act decently , voters must . <p> CAROL JOHNSON <p> Greenwood Village council member
