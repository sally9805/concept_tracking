<p> At MIT 's Media Lab , researchers are giving computers senses like vision and touch , making them easier for us to get along with <p> A visitor wandering around the Massachusetts Institute of Technology might find it a grim and puritan bit of the globe , but the knowing can find entertainment . The Folk Dance Society has a full calendar ; the Science Fiction Club , which boasts the largest holdings of the genre in the world , is happy to see new readers . And if the mood and timing are right , a person might repair to the Media Lab , enter the offices of the Spatial Imaging Group ( SPI ) , settle behind the glass wall separating them from the general building corridor outside , and sit and watch the pilgrims of the cutting edge get whacked out . <p> The pilgrims are the technotourists whose job or passion is to know where tomorrow is happening today . They can be found anywhere at MIT , of course , antennae out , listening for next week 's buzzwords , gobbling up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watering hole . You can sit in the SPI offices and watch the whole tribe flow by : Japanese architects , scouts for Dutch venture capital , high-tech newsletter editors and other science-media factotums , technology-stock analysts up from New York , Silicon Valley VPs for corporate R &D,; " futurologists " from some sensorydeprivation float tank , strategic-marketing consultants , science fiction writers , technology artists , science museum exhibit designers . . . They come scrambling by , bent forward , focused on their next appointment , looking down the hallway for some navigational cue , hot on the spoor of Tomorrowland , when , in a micromoment , ZAPZAPZAPZAP : bang in the retina . <p> First they freeze , as though an elastic tether had reached its limit . You can almost make out the words forming over their heads . " What was that ? " They hang in space for a second . " Did that wall . . . blink ? " And then they back up , turning to face the glassed-in offices and stand staring , silent , like fanciers watching some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like tropical fish themselves . You can stare right back ; they wo n't be bothered . They 're not looking through the glass at all ; they 're looking on it . <p> Specifically , they are looking at four experiments in holography , the technology of perceiving three dimensions directly , without special lenses , from a two-dimensional image . The basic technology is not new , but these particular images  --  a still life of metallic fruits , an MR scan ( magnetic resonance image ) of a brain , a portrait of Leonardo , and an image of a sports car  --  are unlike other holograms in being visible only to viewers standing directly in front of them ( within an arc of about 30 degrees ) . When an image recorded with this technology is mounted on a piece of transparent film , a person approaching will notice nothing until he is immediately opposite , at the moment of closest approach . At that second the hologram will pop into view , will explode out of his peripheral vision , with a vividness that feels like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an art gallery that peeks out of some alternate dimension , looses four quick blasts from a graphics ray gun , and then , if you take two steps forward , twitches back into invisibility . It could not feel more satisfyingly now . Visions of technology , just beyond reach <p> The Media Lab is one of the more eminent research centers around the country that are exploring how computers might improve the relationship of human and machine . One can discover a great diversity of research projects here , with widely varying themes . Using computers to make and display three-dimensional images is one example . Another group is looking at the possible integration of computers with the media we 're used to , such as television  --  designing a TV set that will let you call up more detail about any item appearing on the news . Like these , most of the projects at the lab explore visions of technology that seem tantalizingly possible , but just beyond reach of today 's technology . <p> As intriguing and provocative as each of these projects is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the box than its contents . The lab has a flash that distinguishes it from other research institutes  --  a style that suggests an institutional statement , an illustration of a special attitude toward the relationship of society to engineering research , or even to technology itself . Over time , as the details of the individual projects begin to blur , the memory of the hyperoxygenated atmosphere of the whole remains clear and vivid . More than one visitor has grown to suspect that the Media Lab might prove responsible for no invention more significant than the lab itself . <p> The acorn from which this oak grew was a research group organized in the late ' 60s by a young member of the MIT architecture department , Nicholas Negroponte . Initially Negroponte had been concerned with developing computer programs for architects , but soon his interests spread to the larger problem of what he called " the human interface . " " The human interface . . . is the physical , sensory , and intellectual space that lies between computers and ourselves , " he wrote . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and unwelcoming . But it can also be like some other places , those we know and love , those that are familiar , comfortable , warm , and , most important , personal . " He called his team the " Architecture Machine Group , " which local usage truncated to " Arch Mac . " <p> An example of Arch Mac 's interests was whether our prodigious memory for direction might be adapted to the retrieval of computer data . A person needing aspirin in his cabinet or a paper on his desk or a book in his bookcase usually does n't read the labels of these items ; he just reaches in the right direction . He has associated each " what " with a " where . " Data in a computer , by contrast , are usually organized by keywords or by the number of a cell in a matrix . Perhaps , Negroponte speculated , manipulating data in a computer might be more " comfortable , warm , and personal " if they were arranged in a plane or volume and the user given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for files on a desk . <p> In most universities such a project would be conducted by software engineers or computer scientists , not architects , and the unconventionality of Arch Mac 's auspices gave its research a feel that would be unique anywhere , though especially so at MIT . Suppose an ordinary software engineering lab had developed an interest in this concept ; suppose further that you had dropped by for a look . You would collar a graduate student , who would hospitably clear a space in the midden pile of Chinese-food cartons , pizza boxes , Coke cans , rock-climbing gear and the other diagnostics of totally serious engineering , and wave you to a seat . " Still a lot of hair on this baby , " he might begin happily ; " we have these insane incompatibility problems and the data throughput is slow as peanut butter and the memory handling is full of noise . . . " <p> While you might miss a detail or two , the overall gist would be clear : out there , just beyond the circle of firelight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , striking at will . The day of total pacification might be years away ; predictions would be pointless , and in any case a professional does not tempt fate with idle boasts . At any moment one of the monster terrorist gremlins that ate the controlled fusion and personal helicopter campaigns might appear and join the attack . All a person can do is clear the countryside , yard by yard and hole by hole , and hope . <p> On the other hand , Arch Mac would have welcomed the same visitor into an elegant office with recessed lighting and rich brown furnishings ( except for one wall apparently built of glass ) , with a spiffy Eames chair in the center . " This is the Media Room , " you would be told , " and this . . . whereupon the wall of glass , 13 feet on the diagonal , would fill with portraits , maps , little display screens , letters , book covers , a calendar . . . is Dataland ! " Two tiny joysticks would appear under your hands ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the screen would flow to the right , giving you the visceral impression of steering yourself over a landscape ( Negroponte liked to call Dataland an " informational surround " ) . In seconds you would feel yourself skimming " cities and neighborhoods of information " ( less Iyrically , clusters of symbols ) , hovering over fields of faces ( each representing a file of correspondence with that person ) , arrays of book symbols and meadows of maps . Flying around like this , in the Media Lab 's vision , will be the future equivalent of sitting down at your office desk . <p> There was not a whisper here , direct or indirect , about glitches or gremlins or any kind of problem at all ; you sat down in the chair and were off , as though you were in a Sharper Image showroom . Yet Dataland was in no sense a real-world , finished product . What appeared to be the wall-size TV display was actually a rear-projection from a room behind the screen , for instance , and no display system requiring that much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sketch-in-hardware " of how the fruits of this project might look eventually , when all the engineering problems had been solved . " The underlying assumption , " Negroponte once wrote , " is that the computer-human interface can not be ... studied in baby steps .... Instead we postulate an exaggerated statement , not meant to be taken literally , from which we can recede into . . . effective and comfortable modes of interaction . " <p> The idea of conceptual models came naturally to Negroponte , who as an architect had been trained to give blueprint-illiterate clients direct access to the big picture . He made these " exaggerated statements , " which he called " demos " and " experimental prototypes , " a central element in the life at Arch Mac . ( Elsewhere in academe , a local joke went , you had to " publish or perish " ; at Arch Mac you had to " demo or die . " ) In reality , that is , in the back room , or late at night , the same tide of pizza boxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swirled into the Media Room ; the gremlins were as elusive and treacherous and mocking , and the action just as uphill and hand-to-hand . The only difference was that in the morning the battlefield was planted with flowers , with all the bugs neatly out of sight . <p> In the early ' 80s Negroponte began helping raise funds for a center for the arts at MIT ; when the building opened in 1985 , he reorganized Arch Mac into a larger operation , the Media Lab , and moved in . The Wiesner Building , named after Jerome Wiesner , a former MIT president , is a boxy , sleek , virtually windowless , four-story affair , covered with a grid of large white metal tiles and sited in the middle of an open space on the eastern edge of the campus . Pulses of color inscribed between the tiles give the structure a flickering , edgy , electronic feeling . The Wiesner breaks conspicuously with the general style of architecture at the school , which favors designs so severe and spare that their very lack of drama becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over frippery . " The squareness of the box and the smoothness of the skin make the building appear self-contained and sealed off from the life of the world around it , like a Christmas present that has yet to be unwrapped , " an architect wrote in a review , but to this eye the Wiesner looks less like a Christmas package than a dandy trying to ease his way through the wrong neighborhood . <p> Negroponte has described the lab 's work as the " personalization " of media , in the sense of being individuated or customized . Stewart Brand , technology critic and originator of The Whole Earth Catalog , has suggested a second theme : the design of machines that can participate in conversationlike interactions . A third , which struck me , was reducing the psychic effort required to control computers , so that at the extreme the machine vanishes into its function , becoming no more noticeable than the knob you turn to open a door . A computer that will call a taxi <p> Representative research projects would include a " desktop secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an airline to check on schedule changes , listen for reports on traffic conditions on the road to the airport , dun subordinates for tardy memos and summon a taxi at the appropriate time ; a music synthesizer that can accept a musical score , listen to a human performance and then generate a supporting accompaniment appropriate to the interpretation of that artist ; and a display terminal that tracks the user 's eyes and can dilate , either graphically or with text , on whichever point of the graphic landscape the user 's gaze might linger . ( A casual browser skimming a catalog based on this technology would see nothing but images ; but the moment one caught his eye the document would begin to extoll the pleasures awaiting those wise enough to purchase the particular item , while rotating the product through attractive perspectives . ) There is serious interest here in machine lipreading . <p> The canonical demo , shown seemingly to everyone , probes the coming marriage of computers and newspapers . At present , news text can be delivered to your computer over a modem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not augment the delivered text by pulling maps or background information out of storage on request . The " NewSpeek " demo presents these enhancements not with keyboards or mice but with a touch-sensitive screen  --  tap the name of a country , and there 's the map ; run your finger across a summary paragraph and the underlying text floods the display . Again , the demo was not the product ; it was not connected to even a tiny fraction of the information a real NewSpeek would be . But it rammed home the idea that a custom newspaper could be controlled lightly , glancingly , almost before the wish becomes conscious . <p> One possible reaction to these demos is a mild depression that so much energy and intelligence is being focused on functions so far down the list of real human needs . ( One exception is a project exploring the teaching of physics and math in elementary schools through the introduction of engineering skills . However , few visitors see these demos , since the test schools are all off campus . ) In general , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in rapid succession , the demos seem to add up to a whole environment , as if you had stepped out into some mid-21st-century office complex . The impression is that while the other labs have been backtracking through the frustration and confusion endemic to engineering research , the Media Lab has overleaped them all and is closing on Tomorrowland like a hawk on a pigeon . <p> When the lab opened it was received with intense enthusiasm . The New York Times Sunday Magazine did a story , as did Time and Fortune and most of the science and technology media . ( Both the Times and Stewart Brand gave their overviews the sweeping title " Inventing the Future . " ) An extraordinary range of industrial sectors agreed to underwrite research : financial services , automotive , TV , chemicals , computers , publishing , photography , broadcast , even toys-Lego , of Denmark ( SMITHSONIAN , June 1988 ) , is associated with the educational project mentioned above . <p> From the point of view of the sponsors , this access buys a look at new directions that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reports , presentations and consultations on issues of interest , receive visiting-scientist privileges and , of course , see all the demos . For many sponsors the payoff could be quite practical . The design departments of General Motors , for example , always interested in new tools for visualizing future models , follow the hologram work very closely . From the lab 's point of view , this support buys room and time for the sustained glitch-eradication campaigns most engineering requires , but which the sponsors would find hard to fund in their own organizations . The SPI research is a case in point . <p> When holograms first became popular in the ' 60s , the technology was generally expected to lead to 3-D television in a few years at most . " Anybody could start up a company with Holo- ' in the title , make two or three phone calls and get $3 million , " the director of SPI , Steve Benton , says . The triumph of the new medium seemed so inevitable that the New York cognoscenti even prepared a hologram museum to receive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engineers assigned to bring the product to market traveled behind the headlines , they found a serious demon waiting . Our stereoscopic brain infers depth from the difference between the angles at which light from a given scene enters our two eyes . These differences are too subtle to be captured easily on a photographic emulsion . The slightest vibration during the exposure  --  somebody walking down a neighboring corridor , a truck driving by-blurs them out . Even if the light waves falling on the emulsion vary by wavelength ( frequency ) , the information will be jumbled . Holograms can only be " snapped " in rigidly controlled environments with precisely tuned monochromatic laser illumination . These constraints are not compatible with any imaginable version of Phil Donahue 's show . <p> In theory the weaknesses of emulsions could be avoided by using computers to calculate and print the image , like any other computer graphic . Alas , there is a demon on that bridge , too . Unlike ordinary computer graphics , which reach reasonable levels of quality with " only " a million pixels , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hologram of emulsion quality and comparable size can require a trillion dots ; further , calculating the proper placement and shading of each dot in a hologram is more complicated , and therefore takes longer , than generating a dot in a 2-D computer graphic . Still chasing holographic dreams <p> John Underkoffler at SPI calculated this for me more concretely : as of 1990 , a top-of-the-line computer would need 30 years to print one emulsion-quality hologram . If you wanted to do a five-minute animation , with 16 images per second , that might take 100,000 years of computer time . When all this was explained to the authorities responsible for allocating R &D; dollars , and they understood that holographic snapshots of the Grand Canyon , let alone holographic TV , were considerably more than three fiscal quarters away , they dropped the technology down the hole where all management misfires go . Today the Media Lab is one of the very few research labs ( perhaps the only one ) still chasing the old dreams . <p> For many years now ( Steve Benton worked at Arch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been picking its way through the human spatial-perception system , discarding all information not essential to a convincing 3-D image . We tend to move our heads from side to side , for instance , not up and down , so the holograms here do not work vertically : if you flex your knees or stand on tiptoe in front of the hologram gallery , the objects in the image do not slide over each other . Throwing that information away  --  telling the computers not to bother to calculate those dots  --  cuts the calculation time by more than 99 percent . Because the distance between our left and right eyes , the targets of the process , tends to be fairly predictable , holograms do n't need to reflect every bit of information in every direction , which emulsion holograms do . Throwing away that information cut the calculation time by more than another 99 percent . Designing a hologram that is visible only to someone standing directly in front of the image saved even more time . <p> On the other hand , Underkoffler told me , reflections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information was kept . The SPI team has discarded so much information that the calculation time for each image is now down to a few days , and members are still paring . Benton is even beginning to see the first glimmering possibilities that extremely rudimentary animated holograms might soon be possible . The team speculates that a hologram graphics printer might allow designers to inspect products in 3-D periodically during the design process , surgeons to interpret x rays and CAT scans directly ( without radiologists , who would become obsolete ) and architects to give more-polished demonstrations . In the long run the technology could go anywhere-in 20 years three-dimensional imagery might be flowing over the walls and ceilings of our homes . <p> Whatever happens in that arena , the lab has already made an innovation of another kind : giving engineering ideas the sort of rollout that developers routinely give shopping malls and condominium complexes . Up till now most advanced R &D; in the country , certainly at MIT , has been funded by the government ; to most businessmen , real cutting-edge research has seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a research package that businessmen will buy , and in an era of chronic budget deficits and declining military support , anyone interested in the problem of funding engineering research is likely to see the entire lab as a demo in its own right . The model might not be applicable to every kind of research , but " interface engineering , " progressively thinning the boundary between psyche and computer , is likely to be one of the core industries of the 21st century . In years to come , engineers may need to learn as much about promotion and marketing as , say , architects do . <p> Toward the end of my visit I arranged for a demo of " Backseat Driver , " a navigation system for automobiles . The engineer on the project , Jim Davis , explained that I was to spell out my destination over a cellular speakerphone to a computer back at the lab . Thereafter the computer would monitor my speed and direction along the Cambridge streets through onboard sensors and , using a speech synthesizer , tell me over the speakerphone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He dialed it again . A third time . Something was busy . Maybe the computer was down . Several minutes later , though , he connected and was about to punch in our location when the speakerphone broke . This forced him to listen over the headset and relay the machine 's instructions verbally . <p> " Turn here , " Davis said . " But I have n't told you where I want to go , " I said . " Sometimes it 's better to drive to where the computer thinks you are and start from there , " he replied . I took a right . " Damn ! " Davis said , listening to his headset . " It thinks we 're in the river . " We drove around and around Kendall Square in the rain , while Jim kept trying to get us in synchrony with the machine . " This is just about the worst demo I 've ever had , " he said mournfully , rattling away on a laptop with the phone wedged in his ear , swearing at every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He sighed in exasperation and blew out his cheeks and periodically cried out in pain , presumably because the computer had just said something especially stupid . <p> Finally Jim gave up and we turned to go back to MIT . At that moment the speakerphone suddenly came to life and for the first time I heard the voice:of the computer directly . " I thought you were at Albany and Main , " it said plaintively . I had a feeling that the device really wanted to work and was just lost , out there in solution space , crawling through glitchland . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : The Media Lab 's Mitchel Resnick plays with a Lego merry-go-round driven by a Logo computer program .
