Monday through Friday and on Saturday . Emergencies should be referred to the county 's emergency clinics , she said . <p> Most of Reynolds patients are cats and dogs , but occasionally she sees animals such as rabbits that need their teeth trimmed . Owners of large dogs or multiple pets are some of her most frequent customers . <p> " I did some X-rays on a 120-pound Rottweiler , " she said . " That was kind of a feat .
