FDA and the Consumer , Part 1 <p> The Food and Drug Administration is arguably the nation 's most ubiquitous regulatory agency , with responsibility for more than a trillion dollars worth of consumer products annually . These range from tongue-depressors and x-ray machines to drugs , vaccines , and artificial sweeteners . The FDA 's regulatory regimes are sometimes referred to as the world 's " gold standard , " meaning that the agency 's standards are the most difficult to meet . <p> But the FDA 's regulatory zeal has a dark side . The agency has constantly sought out new mandates and promulgated new requirements , regardless of the costs to patients and regulated industries . Since 1965 , the total time required for drug development  --  from synthesis in the laboratory to the patient 's bedside  --  has increased from 6.5 to 14.8 years . From 1990-93 alone , the average cost of bringing a single drug to market increased from $359 million to $500 million , the highest price tag in the world . The effects are pernicious . <p> Concerns about costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is less investor interest in U.S. pharmaceutical companies and less is spent on research and development than there would otherwise be , and more drug development moves off-shore . ( Seventy-three percent of drugs approved by the FDA during 1987-93 had already been approved abroad . ) <p> Patients ' needs become increasingly subject to the demands of vocal interest groups  --  such as those advocating preferential treatment for patients suffering from AIDS  --  claiming extenuating circumstances . Meantime , those with diseases not in political favor  --  the vast majority  --  gain nothing from this process . <p> Efforts to reform the FDA have been under way for many years . President Clinton recently signed new legislation , passed by Congress this fall , advertised as providing the needed remedies . But this , in fact , comes up short . The problem , as we shall discuss below , is that current initiatives , despite the fanfare , fail to address the underlying incentives built into how the FDA regulates risk . Over-regulation , and the hazards to public health that it poses , will continue . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inefficiency and excesses have been remedied , that the time required for approval of drugs for marketing is shrinking , and that critics are complaining about " the FDA of another era . " <p> Contrary to these assertions , in recent years the FDA has arguably moved in the opposite direction , introducing numerous obstacles to drug manufacture and clinical testing that have made regulation progressively more burdensome , reduced competition among companies , and increased the cost of drugs to consumers . <p> The FDA 's small improvements in marketing-approval times in recent years have been more than offset by the agency 's slowing the overall process of drug development . These have taken the form of both new regulations and more stringent interpretations of old ones . None of them , however , addresses the fundamental problem : the distorted incentives and disincentives , rewards and punishments , that make bureaucrats do what they do . <p> It 's no secret , for example , that FDA 's reviewers and managers have a " zero-risk " mind-set that is hard to satisfy , no matter how compelling or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get useful new products out into physicians ' offices , pharmacies , and hospitals ? As a matter of fact , no . They have other things on their minds . FDA officials think a lot about staying out of trouble  --  and therein lies the nub of the problem . <p> There exists a marked asymmetry between the two kinds of wrong decisions that a regulator can make : ( 1 ) a harmful drug or other product is approved for marketing ( a " Type 1 " error ) , or ( 2 ) a beneficial drug or other product is rejected or never achieves marketing approval ( a " Type 2 " error ) . <p> Classic examples of Type 1 errors are the approvals of the tranquilizer thalidomide by some European regulatory agencies and the approval of the " swine flu " vaccine by the FDA . These mistakes are highly visible . They elicit the wrath of the media , the public , and legislative oversight bodies . As a result , often both the developers of the drug and the regulators who allowed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ include congressional oversight hearings , " 60 Minutes , " and the editorial page of The New York Times . A bureaucrat 's career might be damaged irreparably by the good-faith but mistaken approval of a high-profile product . <p> Type 2 errors , in the form of unreasonable demands or requirements , can delay or prevent entirely the marketing of a new product . But a Type 2 error caused by regulators ' bad judgments , timidity , or anxiety is often known only to a few knowledgeable scientists , not physicians or the patients who might benefit from the treatment . And if the regulator 's mistake precipitates the company 's decision to abandon the drug , the media , patient advocacy groups , and the public at large often encounter only uncertainty and inadequate information . There may be no direct evidence that the continued suffering of patients is avoidable  --  or that the regulators are culpable . Too often , non-experts are satisfied with FDA 's " erring on the side of safety , " even when this is merely a euphemism for " committing a Type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awaiting needed new therapies . <p> Bureaucrats , like the rest of society , generally act in their own self-interest , even when those actions are inimical to the best interests of others . Therefore , they have learned to avoid Type 1 errors at almost any cost  --  even when their actions push them inexorably and systematically toward costly Type 2 errors . <p> A regulatory agency 's incentives and disincentives are , thus , distorted . The system of rewards and punishments generally encourages regulators to think like a special interest group  --  that is , to do what benefits them , rather than what benefits consumers , society as a whole , or ( God forbid ) American industry . <p> Once we understand the influence of these incentives , we can see how recent regulatory initiatives have failed to address the problem or have actually made matters worse . Consider some examples : <p> Extraordinarily Stringent Rules for Reporting Drug Side Effects . A regulation proposed in 1994 which is expected to take effect soon will send the cost of clinical trials right off the charts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects more quickly and to presume that the new drug is to blame any time a patient gets sick or sicker during a study . The regulations reconfigure the burden of proof so that all new drugs are considered guilty until conclusively proven innocent . They set an arbitrary and significantly lower regulatory threshold for stopping a clinical trial , making the entire drug development process even more risk-averse , slower , and more expensive . <p> The comments on this proposal from industry and academia are revealing . For example , the DuPont-Merck Pharmaceutical Company estimated that , under the proposed regulations , its reporting burden would double for each prospective drug in development . When medical researchers at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Clinical Trials carefully compared two clinical trials , one performed with reporting according to the old requirements and one under the new rules , they concluded that the FDA 's proposed changes would increase the cost per patient and the paperwork generated per patient 62-fold and 63-fold , respectively . They estimated that the costs of that single trial would be increased by $24 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs were not accompanied by a commensurate advantage to patients . <p> FDA Policies on Drug ' Promotion . ' The FDA has the authority to regulate labeling and therapeutic claims for a drug . " Promotion " of an as-yet unapproved use of an approved drug is prohibited , even if the peer-reviewed literature unequivocally supports such use . <p> The FDA has interpreted promotion to encompass any printed materials or advertisements , as well as a wide range of other activities . Drug companies have been proscribed from distributing journal articles or textbook chapters to physicians to inform them about important new  --  but as yet unapproved  --  uses . In effect , the FDA prohibits distribution of textbooks and articles to health professionals if the materials so much as mention not-yet-approved uses of drugs  --  even though these constitute almost half of all physicians ' prescriptions , about 70% of all cancer chemotherapy , and 90% of drugs used in pediatrics . <p> Physicians ' opinions about the FDA 's effectiveness are revealing . A 1995 survey of clinical oncologists found that nearly two-thirds believe the FDA has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a patient on at least one occasion , " and over one in 10 believe this has happened " frequently . " Three-quarters " oppose FDA restrictions on off-label information , " and 60% believe these make their job more difficult . Similar results were obtained in a survey of cardiologists : half maintained that FDA regulations prevent them from using promising new drugs or medical devices , 71% felt that FDA 's approval process had hurt their ability to give patients the best care , and 57% said that unnecessary delays in product approval by the FDA actually cost lives . <p> As part of their oversight of labeling and promotion , the FDA has told companies that , prior to product approval , they can not convene focus groups to determine how to make packaging and labeling more user-friendly . <p> FDA 's Pseudo-reforms . Various supposed reforms that have dribbled out during the past several years  --  often with great fanfare  --  have accomplished little . <p> One was the agency 's 1995 announcement of changes that would ostensibly modernize and streamline oversight of a class of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Historically , biological drugs  --  blood and blood products , vaccines , extracts of natural substances for treating allergies , extracts of living cells , and the like  --  were treated differently from others because they were often rather impure and poorly characterized substances . Thus , because it was difficult to demonstrate that each batch met specified standards of purity or potency , the FDA granted marketing approval for the product itself , which had to be safe and effective , and also for the manufacturing establishment , certifying that there was adequate control and rigor in production . In addition , samples from every production batch had to be submitted for certification by the FDA . <p> Non-biological drugs  --  for pain , ulcers , high blood pressure , and so forth  --  were traditionally smaller , simpler , chemically synthesized molecules that could be highly purified and characterized . In contrast to biologicals , neither licensing of the manufacturing facility nor batch certification was required . <p> Advances in technology have blurred the distinction between biologicals and other drugs . Many biologicals  --  particularly those made with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or gene splicing , and hybridoma technology )  --  are now often highly purified , well  --  characterized preparations that can be regulated the same as other drugs . Biologicals ' manufacturing facilities continue to be certified , but in practice this is not very different from the inspections that are performed in the plants that make non-biological drugs . <p> The FDA 's " reform " enables biologicals that are " well characterized biotechnology products " to be regulated as though they were non-biological drugs . For this subset of biotechnology products , the requirements for licensing of the manufacturing facility and for batch certification have been officially eliminated . These are hardly dramatic changes from the status quo , especially in view of the fact that there have been only about 20 biotechnology-derived biologicals approved by FDA during the past decade . <p> Another pseudo-reform was presented with great fanfare by President Clinton , Vice President Gore , Health and Human Services Secretary Shalala , and FDA Commissioner Kessler in March 1996  --  the very day after three FDA reform bills were introduced in the House of Representatives . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of surrogate endpoints " to speed up the entire process " of cancer-drug development . " It is appropriate to utilize objective evidence of tumor shrinkage as a basis for approval , allowing additional evidence of increased survival and/or improved quality of life associated with that therapy to be demonstrated later , " an FDA statement said . <p> There really was n't anything new here . The FDA has a long tradition of flexibility in drug testing and approval standards , including the use of various " surrogate endpoints " for disease regression or prevention . For drugs that lower serum cholesterol or blood pressure , for example , FDA no longer requires a demonstration that treatment actually increases survival or reduces the incidence of heart attacks and stroke : significant improvement of " the numbers " is sufficient . Moreover , as long ago as 1991 the FDA had adopted ( at least in theory ) a policy of using " flexibility in the current statute to develop and adopt surrogate endpoints whenever possible to measure the efficacy of drugs used to treat life-threatening diseases . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an agency 's being directed to reform itself . It has been progressively clear that real change in the FDA would have to come from new legislation  --  and the House Commerce Committee tried during the 104th Congress in a bill that balanced momentous social and economic issues , legal precedents , and the public interest . The Drugs and Biological Products Reform Act of 1996 addressed in several ingenious ways the ponderousness and length of drug testing and evaluation . Introduced by a bipartisan group of a dozen congressmen ( and eventually boasting approximately 160 co-sponsors ) , it was a vast improvement over the status quo . For example , it clarified that all of the voluminous raw data from clinical trials  --  often running to hundreds of thousands of pages  --  will not always be required by the FDA . Condensed , tabulated or summarized data often will be adequate , with agency reviewers having access to additional material when requested by their supervisory officials . <p> The legislation would have established a new , more liberal approval standard for drugs intended to treat any " serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AIDS drugs , the new standard was " a reasonable likelihood that the drug will be effective in a significant number of patients and that the risk from the drug is no greater than the risk from the condition . " <p> This was just common sense . It was also humane : It would have extended to patients with diseases like stroke , multiple sclerosis , Alzheimer 's disease , emphysema , crippling arthritis and heart failure the benefits currently reserved for those with AIDS . <p> The bill would have changed in important ways what amounts to FDA 's censorship of scientific and medical information . It would have permitted the legitimate dissemination of information via textbooks and articles from peer-reviewed journals . <p> Equally important , because it goes to the basic issue of how new uses are sanctioned for an already-approved drug , the legislation would have permitted retrospective evidence from clinical research ( instead of expensive and time-consuming prospective studies ) to be an alternate basis for approving additional uses . <p> The most significant changes promised by the legislation would have turned over part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of FDA 's regulatory " monopoly " has been recommended repeatedly by blue-ribbon expert groups convened to improve the drug-approval system . ( See " Speeding Drug Approvals , Safely , Privately , " at page 14 . ) <p> The Clinton administration 's opposition to the bill was intense , a presidential veto was threatened , and the bill was abandoned . <p> New Law , Little Progress . Chastened by the defeat , Congress tried again in 1997 . But the resulting reform legislation  --  passed on November 9th and signed by President Clinton on November 20th  --  accomplishes little . In fact , that seems to have been the intent of the bill , which approaches the FDA reform in several inconsequential ways , more window dressing than substance . <p>  --  First , the new law changes the FDA 's mission , adding the obligation for " promptly and efficiently reviewing clinical research " and making decisions " in a timely manner . " But it is naive to think that this symbolism will have any impact on the agency 's 30-year tradition of risk-aversion and foot-dragging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to develop a plan by 2000 for clearing the legendary backlog of products awaiting approval . With this provision , Congress has made itself a hostage to an endless series of demands for additional resources the agency will claim are essential for meeting the required goal . Though , again , the distorted incentives in the approval process remain intact . <p>  --  Third , it permits the FDA to approve a drug for marketing on the basis of a single clinical trial where previous statutory language referred to " trials , " plural . This is largely symbolic . The FDA easily could have made a case for approval on the basis of a single , definitive trial under the previous language . But the point is moot : The average number of trials performed to support approval of a new drug is currently more than 40 ! <p>  --  Fourth , it codifies many policies that are already in place , adding nothing to the status quo but attempting to convey the impression of a lengthy list of improvements . <p> The most important provision in the legislation offers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctors about drugs ' " off-label " uses ( those not yet approved by FDA ) . As discussed above , companies have been prohibited by the FDA from distributing such critical information . But even this improvement comes at a high price  --  substantial additional paperwork involved in convincing the FDA that formal applications for approval of the new uses are forthcoming . <p> The bill contains some minor improvements , such as loosened restrictions on health claims for food products and expanded use of third parties , including academic institutions , to review medical devices . Another welcome provision permits manufacturers to submit " health care economic information , " such as data on a drug 's cost-effectiveness , to hospitals and health maintenance organizations . <p> One sneaky provision actually increases the scope of FDA 's regulation by expanding the agency 's jurisdiction to activities that occur completely within a single state . For the first time , the FDA explicitly will have regulatory authority over small-scale research by an academic or practicing physician testing an innovative therapy . <p> What is most worrisome about the legislation is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommended by blue-ribbon panels are conspicuously absent . These include reducing the redundancy of regulation of early-stage clinical trials , which could be overseen solely by hospital-based review boards . This pivotal change would reduce significantly the time and costs involved in clinical trials , a particular advantage for smaller companies . <p> Neither does the bill include a binding reciprocity provision that , for example , would limit FDA review of a new drug to a maximum of , say , 60 days after its approval in the United Kingdom or by the European Medicines Evaluation Agency . The FDA would then have to show cause why the drug should not be marketed in the United States , or it would be approved automatically . <p> Overall , the scope of the " reform " legislation is disappointing . Following Congress 's failure to accomplish meaningful FDA reform , the costs of drug development will continue to rise , fewer drugs will be developed , and market competition will erode . Patients will suffer higher prices and benefit from fewer breakthrough drugs . <p> ILLUSTRATION <p> By Henry I.
