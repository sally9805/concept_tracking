As described in part one of this series , Owl Observatory is a 10 ' x 10 ' building located about 25 miles east of Great Falls , Montana , near the small community of Highwood . Because I wanted access to the entire sky for astrophotography , my observatory has a rolloff roof rather than a dome . But I also wanted access to objects near the horizon , so the upper two feet of the walls of the observatory fold down . The elevated wooden floor prevents animals from nesting under the building and is warmer than concrete during the cold winter months . I used only powered hand tools  --  a saw , a small miter saw , a scroll saw , a couple of drills , and a borrowed router  --  to build the observatory . A borrowed generator powered these tools at the work site . The entire cost of the structure was $1,500 . Part 1 described how I built the steel pier for the telescope and its concrete footing . It also described how to lay out the foundation for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ footings . Because this phase of the construction ended as winter approached , I had to stop construction at the site . But work did n't stop . I prefabricated the walls and roof in my garage . In this installment , I 'll tell you how to build the floor and walls and erect the walls on site . First we 'll look at the floor construction . BUILDING THE FLOOR My floor is built over a series of joists that are suspended above the ground by the post brackets set in the footings . The two main rim joists run north-south ( see illustration at right ) . These 4x8 timbers rest directly in the post brackets with 1/2 " bolts securing them . If you ca n't get 4x8s , use two 2x8s nailed together and a 1/2 " spacer to hold them securely in the post bracket . I used 2x8s for the floor joists , including the east-west perimeter joists . These joists fit into the post brackets with a 2 " spacer . I cut my spacers from 4x4 lumber . Using metal hangers available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the north-south rim joists . I started at the ends of the rim joists and placed the remaining joists on 16 " centers . ( You may wish to cheat a little on the spacing of the third joist to make it easier to install the subflooring . Move it about 1/2 " outwards . ) The joists closest to the pier will end up on roughly 22-1/2 " centers , which is okay if you use at least 5/8 " plywood for the subflooring . Because the east-west perimeter joists go on the very end of the rim joists , the normal metal hanger does n't work properly . You can ask your hardware dealer for right-angle brackets that go on just one side of the joist . Alternatively , you could toe-nail the joist to the rim joist . It is nearly impossible to wire the telescope pier once the subflooring is installed , so take a short break from the floor carpentry and put on your electrician 's hat . Run wire through the pier into the conduit that goes between the joists to the future location @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enclosed in conduit to prevent animals from gnawing through the insulation . Luckily , working with some of the newer plastics is easier than with the old thick-wall metal variety . Be sure your electrical service is protected by ground-fault circuit interruption ( also known as GFCI ) . The subflooring is plywood and I attached it directly over the joists . I used 5/8 " CDX ( inexpensive exterior grade ) plywood because I expected to lay particle board as a floor underlayment over this subflooring material . You can use the plywood directly as the floor material , for which you need to use 1 " plywood . In this case , you may wish to use a higher grade of plywood ( AC ) for a smoother floor finish . Laying a plywood floor is easy . Just be sure that the edge or the plywood lies over a joist . Sixteen-inch centers for the joists make this easy . You can find 4 ' x 10 ' sheets of plywood , but more commonly you will find 4 ' x 8 ' sheets . Because the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to cut several 2 ' sections to piece in the rest of the floor . In this case , stagger your joints to make the floor stronger , and place factory edge to factory edge to make a tighter joint . Nail ( 8d ) or screw ( 2 " long ) the plywood to the joists about every 6 " . Whatever size plywood you are using , you need to cut a hole in the inner floor section ( roughly 22-1/2 " wide ) or the telescope pier . A hole could be cut in one long section of plywood , but it is easier to piece in two shorter sections of plywood with half-circles cut in one edge . The diameter of the half-circles should be about 1/2 " larger than the pipe so the floor wo n't rub against the pipe and cause the telescope to vibrate . Bridging  --  pieces that run at right angles to the joists  --  cut from 2x8s nailed to the joists near the pier will help to Casten the edge of the plywood . Keep these bridging pieces at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the walls and roof , the floor is exposed to the elements . So I gave the floor and exposed portions of the perimeter joists a coat of exterior primer . Then I filled the pier with sand to help dampen the vibrations when I move or bump the telescope . A scrap piece of 1/4 " - thick steel plate seals the top of the pier . Three holes drilled and tapped in the plate help secure the telescope mount . I formed a collar around this plate from 2 " - wide strap iron . Set screws in the collar fasten this assembly to the pier . With this plate in place , we are ready to build the walls . BUILDING THE WALLS During the winter , I prefabricated walls in my garage and transported them later to the work site in my truck . The garage was warm and I could build the walls squarely , something that would have been harder to do at the work site . Only the fold-down sections of the wall were sheathed in the garage because they are short and light . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with studs on 16 " centers . Three-inch screws or 16d nails fasten the studs to the plates , two fasteners for each end . I used screws because they wo n't loosen easily from wind loading on the building . My floor is exactly 10 ' x 10 ' ' , so I cut our sections 9 ' ' - 8- 1/2 " long or the west and east top and bottom plates , one section 9 ' ' -9 " for the north top plate and two sections 9 ' ' -5 " or the south top and bottom plates . The north bottom plate was cut as two pieces to accommodate the door . I chose a 36 " - wide prehung door . The wide door makes carrying equipment in and out easy , and since it was prehung , it was easy to install . The corner studs in both corners of the north wall and the south corners of the west and east wall ( see the illustration on page 83 ) use three 2x4s nailed together . The two extra backing , or jack , studs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the connecting walls and help to support the weight or the roof . The north corners of the west and east walls and both corners of the south walls have single studs . Note that one 2x4 in each corner in the north wall is 4 " shorter than the others to act as a support for the roll-off roof rails ( see the illustration on page 86 ) . The frame or the door consists of two studs on each side and a 2x4 header above the door screwed directly to the top plate . The header rests on top of the inner stud of the door frame for Extra strength . Since this is n't s load-bearing wall , this simple header is sufficient . The walls are 6 ' high . ( Check your local building codes to be sure you can use such a low wall for an out-building . ) The north wall studs were roughly 69 " long . A standard 80 " exterior door  --  and its jamb  --  must be cut down 13 " to lit this height and still permit a 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solid-core door so it may be cut easily to length . The bottom door hinge will have to be repositioned since it was in the part of the door that was cut off . Or have a millwork company custom build a door and frame for you . The west , east , and south walls have two sections : the top fold-down section and the rigid bottom section . The Cold-down sections use 21 " studs , while the bottom sections of the walls use 45 " studs . The studs in the west , east , and south walls are placed on 16 " centers from the middle of the wall . Since the 10 ' wall lengths are n't even multiples of 16 " , the last studs on each side will lie closer to the corner than 16 " . This is helpful since reinforced corners will better support the roof load . Three studs in the north wall are placed 16 " on center between the corner studs and the double studs for the door frame . ( Four studs are shown in the illustration on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' . ) Small header plates made from 2x4s are screwed or nailed into the corner stud pocket near the top plate ( see the illustration on page 86 ) . A gate hook attached to this header secures the old-down wall section when it is raised . The old-down wall sections have top and bottom plates of the same lengths as the rigid wall sections . Unlike the rigid sections , the fold-down sections were sheathed before being moved to the observatory site . I used 3/8 " exterior grade oriented-strand board ( OSB ) for the sheathing . Look for 4 ' x 10 ' sections of OSB or plywood at your lumber store . These large sheets make covering the fold-down sections easy . However , many home improvement stores carry only 8 ' sections , in which case you will have to piece the sheathing together . Be sure each joint falls over a stud and place the factory edges together or a tight joint . Screw ( 1-1/2 " ) Or nail ( 6d ) the plywood to the plates and studs about every 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the observatory site and the weather warmed up , 1 moved the prefabricated walls to the observatory site . The north wall went up first . I aligned the edge of its bottom plate with the outside edge of the floor and screwed the bottom plate through the floor and into the perimeter joists with 3 " screws , one screw per stud pocket . I screwed a scrap length of 2x4 loosely to one of the studs . Once the wall was plumb , I screwed the 2x4 to a stake driven into the ground to hold the wall in position during the installation of the other walls . Next , I temporarily placed the other three walls to ensure that everything fit well . The west and east walls went in next , and screws fastened these walls to the rim joists . Screws driven every 12 " also joined these walls to the north wall corner studs . Then I secured the south wall section with screws through the bottom plate into the perimeter joist and through the south wall 's end studs into the west and east @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the temporary bracing holding the north wall plumb could be removed . Next I sheathed the rigid wall sections . As with the fold-down sections , I used 3/8 " OSB The sheathing should extend to the bottom edge of the joists . Remember , if you piece the sheathing together , place the factory edges together and stagger the joints for a stronger wall . Be sure that all vertical joints occur over the studs . Screw ( 11/2 " ) Or nail ( 6d ) the sheathing every 6 " along the edges of the plywood and every 12 " along the other stud locations . When sheathing the walls , it is important to build the corner so it is weatherproof . The sheathing of one wall should be lush with the corner formed by the studs . The sheathing from the adjacent studs should then overlap the sheathing of the first wall ( see the illustration on page 85 ) . Extending the sheathing to the bottom of the joist protects the floorwall plate connection . Now you can install the door according to the manufacturer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frame is securely fastened , remove the door until the roof is in place to allow for easier construction . Be sure to allow or the threshold , but do not install it yet . It 's a nuisance while construction is underway . Before installing the fold-down wall sections , you should install the siding . This ensures that the hinge spacing is correct so the top wall section folds down properly . I used 3/8 " - hardboard siding . Use long vertical pieces of siding so there are no horizontal joints to trap water , and stagger the joints so they do n't all over the vertical joints in the OSB . Overlap the edges at the corners as you did with the OSB to make the corner weatherproof . INSTALLING THE FOLD-DOWN WALLS Once the siding was in place , I located the positions for the four strap hinges in each wall section , two hinges about 6 " from ends of the wall and the other two spaced evenly in between . I used a router to recess the hinges into the wall plates  --  two wood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ router . Once the hinges were fastened securely to the wall plates , the outline of the hinge was traced onto the bottom plate of the fold-down section . ( Place a piece of siding between the wall sections so you 'll mark the proper hinge location . After routing these areas , I screwed the told-down section to the hinges . As with the rigid wall sections , I installed the west and east sections first so the south section could be test fitted before marking its hinge positions . Two-foot sections of aluminum angle along the north wall corner studs prevent the east and west fold-down sections from extending into the building when raised . Additional pieces of aluminum angle installed along the jack studs of the east and west old-down sections prevent the south fold-down section from pushing in too far . I installed headers made from 2x4s into the top corners of each fold-down wall section . Gate hooks and screw eyes screwed in the headers  --  and those in the north wall  --  hold the wall sections together when raised . Purchase stout hooks for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor rolls on and off the walls . ROLL-OFF ROOF RAILS The last step of phase two construction is to install the bottom timber of the roll-off roof rails . The shortest member of the corner studs in the north wall supports one end of these rails and posts support the other end The posts are made from 4x4s and fit into the post brackets to north of the building . If the post brackets were installed level with one another , then the height of the posts should be equal to the thickness of the joists , thickness or the floor , and height of the walls . My posts are 6 ' ' - 7-7/8 " high and have a 1-1/2 " deep , 5-1/2 " long rabbet cut on the outside portion at top to hold the rail . A 1-2 " bolt holds the post to the support . Temporary bracing made from 2x4s kept the posts plumb until the top rails and cross-braces could be installed in phase three of construction . The rails are made from 13 ' lengths of 2x6 lumber . The long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give greater access to the northern sky . I screwed one end of the rail to the north wall jack posts and bolted the other end to the post with 4 " carriage bolts . To minimize accidents , I beveled the bottom corner of the rail . The rails signal the end of phase two construction . In the final installment of this series , I 'll describe the rest of the roll-off roof rail structure , roof construction , and finishing touches . Part one of this series appeared in the April issue of ASTRONOMY and the third and final installment will appear in the June issue . <p>                     @x Recently I was fortunate to participate in the testing of a K-12 diversity curriculum course at the University of Massachusetts Amherst . The purpose of the pilot course , Making Diversity Count , was to increase the educator 's capacity to create and sustain an environment in the classroom that modeled respect , fairness , and equity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's cultural competency as we work with diverse students in our schools . <p> Our schools are rapidly becoming more diverse ; over 40% of children in public schools now come from what are known as " minority " groups . And , this percent is predicted to grow in the next two decades . Yet the teaching force ( and definitely our profession ) continues to be quite " majority " in ethnicity . <p> Learning how to interact among diverse groups that now make up a large part of the student population is critical to student success . Still there is significant tension between groups with an idea of " us and them " as we try to effectively work with each student with a different culture , language , learning style , and background than ours . <p> In this course , we examined and discussed various issues about identity , prejudice , cultural differences , and value systems . We also were asked to devise a plan that would incorporate some of the information and resources we had learned into a curriculum . We were then asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned about the power the teacher -- learned that the cultural competence of the educator has considerable weight and influence on student learning . <p> I thought I was pretty culturally competent . This course allowed me to interact with other teachers and understand some of the basic terms and concepts important to a K-12 classroom that might be interpreted other than what I thought about them . My biggest take-away from this course was to know that I had lots more to learn . As I examined my own personal attitudes and behaviors , I became aware of my personal biases and preconceptions as well as those of my colleagues around me in the school environment . I began to recognize what prejudices I held , what prejudices I found around me , and what prejudices are held in our education system . <p> It was very important to learn how to manage conflict in my school library as well as know to be a more global and culturally literate teacher-librarian . Learning how to respond to conflict through collaboration was empowering . It reinforced my sense that collaboration can be very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs , ideas , and values . But it also reminded me of how much time and patience is invested in being a collaborator . <p> As teacher-librarians strive to integrate the learning/teaching success of students and faculties with the school library , we also wrestle with the issues of diversity in our collection and in our work . How we handle these concerns requires us to examine our own biases and our own behaviors to determine how others including our students perceive them . A recent study from the United States Department of Education finds that the effect a teacher has on student achievement can be long lasting . The study also states that more than 25% of teachers of minority students do not have the training to meet these students ' needs . The teacher-librarian can sync these two . <p> Did taking this course increase my capacity to be a less prejudicial teacher ? I hope so . I know it increased my capacity to know what interactions might be construed as less than positive by my students while I learned ways to make these a bit more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course was realizing that I will never be completely " good " at this , but I can keep trying . ... <p> So , what was the most valuable take-away from the course ? It was the understanding of how to objectively examine and review one 's own biases . Transform your self before you try to transform your school . Develop your skills in cultural competencies , and validate the many cultures you find in your world by exploring each as much as you can . You can learn from your students as they learn from you in this way -- another collaborative endeavor . <p> By Elizabeth " Betty " Marcoux <p>
