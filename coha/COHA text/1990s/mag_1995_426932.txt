Section : INTERNATIONAL BOSNIA Once a treaty is signed , allied troops will be on the spot <p> The troops had practiced there was nothing more to rehearse . In a make-believe Bosnian village called " Schwend , " located at a U.S. base in southern Germany , some of the soldiers dressed up as civilians needing help , while others posed as potentially troublesome Serbian , Croatian or Muslim fighters . Troops in helicopters simulated the rescue under fire of endangered United Nations personnel . Infantrymen absorbed lectures on " mine awareness "  --  a warning that Bosnia is littered with thousands of deadly land mines and booby traps . Officers talked about what to do if snipers shoot at their men . ( " We 'll blow them away , " promised a senior NATO commander . ) Logistical experts plotted the rail journey that would be required to move a heavy armored division from Bavaria to Bosnia . The troops of the " implementation force , " as it was euphemistically named , packed their gear and took their shots . Now all IFOR needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreements , actually : one among the warring parties in Bosnia and another between Bill Clinton and the Republicans in Congress . The first negotiation seemed to be on the verge of success late last week . At an air base near Dayton , Ohio , U.S. mediator Richard Holbrooke led the presidents of Bosnia , Croatia and Serbia through the final , maddeningly difficult details of an agreement that would preserve Bosnia as a single state , at least on paper , and end the ethnic fighting there , at least for now . " R 's not exactly a good deal , " said Bosnian Foreign Minister Muhamed Sacirbey , who resigned so that his job could be given to a Bosnian Croat in a power-sharing arrangement . " But anyway , a bad peace is better than war , right ? " <p> The initialing of the document in Dayton was to be followed , two weeks later , by a formal signing ceremony , after which NATO combat units would start to arrive in Bosnia . The signing was originally planned for Paris , but with Republicans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move the ceremony to the White House . In a letter to Speaker Newt Gingrich , Clinton said that if the agreement went through , he would send about 20,000 U.S. troops to help enforce the settlement in Bosnia . They would stay for about a year , he wrote , at a cost of about $1.5 billion . He added that it was " not possible to make meaningful casualty predictions . " Congress would have a chance to pass judgment on the mission before the treaty is signed . <p> House Republicans responded by pushing through a bill to block any spending on a U.S. deployment in Bosnia . " Before our troops hit the ground , I want the answer-for what ? " said the sponsor of the measure , Rep. Joel Heflley of Colorado . The vote for the bill was far from veto-proof , and in the end , Congress will probably go along with the deployment , if only because impeding it would almost certainly shoot down any peace agreement . Having registered their objections , the Republicans can blame Clinton for every setback-and every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republicans were not the only ones who had been dragging their feet . NATO 's Bosnia force was supposed to be about 60,000 strong . But in the early stages of the planning for IFOR , pledges added up to only about 50,000 troops . The initial plan drawn up by NATO 's military commander , U.S. Gen. George Joulwan , said France would need to provide 12,000 to 15,000 troops for its sector of Bosnia ( map ) . But French President Jacques Chirac balked at that big a commitment . Instead , France may contribute only a little more than the 7,000 troops it already has in Bosnia as U.N . peacekeepers . <p> Then the allies mounted a recruiting drive among non-NATO nations , in-eluding some Muslim countries with competent armed forces , such as Pakistan . In the end , 20 non-NATO countries pledged troops , which will more than suffice to fill Joulwan 's quota . But even the United States wanted to hold down the size of its Bosnian contingent ; the White House preferred a more politically palatable number under 20,000 , if at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " troops in Bosnia , " neglecting to mention the many thousands more who will handle logistics in Croatia and Hungary and nm air and naval operations from ships offshore and bases in other countries . <p> The first NATO troops will arrive in Bosnia even before the formal signing . " Assessment teams " will size up the local infrastructure and start to install a communications system for IFOR . Within hours after the treaty is signed , an " enabling force " of up to 2,000 specialists in logistics and communications will be on its way to the region . The first U.S. combat unit is expected to arrive within two weeks : 5,000 light infantry from the Army 's Southeast European Task Force , based at Vicenza , Italy . The schedule calls for half of IFOR to be in place a month after the signing , with the rest deployed within three months . The main American muscle will be provided by the First Armored Division , based in southern Germany  --  a slow-moving behemoth with 16,300 troops , 348 tanks , 652 armored personnel carriers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will take 200 trainloads to move the division from Bavaria to Bosnia . <p> The overall commander of IFOR , U.S. Adm . Leighton ( Snuffy ) Smith , will set up his headquarters in Sarajevo . The country will be divided into three sectors ( map ) : the American , headquartered at Tuzla ; the British , at Gornji Vakuf , and the French , at Sarajevo . Troops provided by other nations will be assigned to various sectors . A Russian contingent of roughly 3,000 men will probably deploy in the U.S. zone . The Russians insist they are not serving under NATO 's command but are merely part of a multinational peacekeeping force . But they would be under the day-to-day control of the First Armored 's commander , Maj. Gen. William Nash . Defense Secretary William Perry said the Russians can not " pick and choose " which orders they will obey . <p> IFOR will serve as a buffer for the warring parties . Joulwan 's plan calls for demilitarized zones 2.5 miles wide between the Serbs and their Muslim and Croatian foes . Heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how much force will the allies use to implement the plan , and under what circumstances will they open fire ? Last month Joulwan said IFOR will be " a Chapter 7 versus a Chapter 6 operation . " Chapter 6 of the U.N . Charter provides for the " pacific settlement of disputes "  --  lightly armed peacekeeping  --  while Chapter 7 provides for a more robust response to " acts of aggression " and other threats . Desert Storm , the war against Iraq , was a Chapter 7 operation . <p> This time , IFOR troops will employ standard NATO rules of engagement , meaning they can shoot first if they think they have to . The plan is for IFOR to retaliate very heavily against the first sign oF resistance . But the rules of engagement still are n't entirely clear to the men who will have to live with them in the field . " They wo n't be simple , " said a U.S. officer in Europe , " and no one is happy with them in their present state . " A major sticking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collateral damage " - the unintended killing of civilians . <p> Bill Clinton hopes the job will be done in a year , with at least some of the boys coming home before Election Day . Elements of the armored division might be among the first to leave ; at around 70 tons , their M1-A2 tanks are too heavy for most of Bosnia 's roads and bridges . How will IFOR know when its job is done ? The " exit strategy " was still a bit fuzzy , but sources said the administration had developed three criteria that , taken together , would justify a withdrawal : ( 1 ) the successful separation of the warring parties ; ( 2 ) the holding of national and local elections , which the parties promised to do next year , and ( 3 ) the arming and training of Bosnian government forces so they can hold their own on the battlefield . The administration may spell out its exit plan in public this week , which makes some U.S. officials uncomfortable . " If it 's published , then we 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military planner . " They 'll have their little checklist and eat us alive . " <p> A full-scale resumption of the war by the Serbs and their enemies could be another signal for withdrawal . But the allies do n't want to be chased out , so rather than just turn tail , they will try to stop any new fighting . In the early stages of the mission , their most dangerous adversary could be Bosnia 's nasty climate  --  " General Winter , " as a Pentagon officer puts it . There were 27 inches of snow on Mount Igman outside Sarajevo last week . Planners worried about the casualties that might result from armored personnel carriers skidding off icy mountain roads . StiR , a cold welcome to Bosnia is probably better than a hot departure . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : ' Before our troops hit the ground , I want the answer  --  for what ?
