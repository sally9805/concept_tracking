The past few Woody Allen films have flirted , in a provocatively meanspirited way , with the public aspects of his personality . Deconstructing Harry focused on Woody the selfish lover , Celebrity on Woody the capricious star . The new one has reverbs of Woody 's Monday-night gigs in a classical jazz ensemble . Sweet and Lowdown is about one sour fellow , but it 's another character who gives this minor movie a surprising lilt and afterglow . <P> Emmet Ray ( Sean Penn ) is the premier American jazz guitarist . His fingers sculpt gorgeous sounds from the six strings ; I 'm Forever Blowing Bubbles was never so poignant or supple as in his hands . But Emmet is also a pimp , petty thief , paranoid ... if there 's a bad word that starts with p , he 's likely to be it . Driven by ego , dogged by insecurity , he rationalizes his outrages as the spillage of an overflowing talent . <P> Penn does bold justice to this lowdown giant . But Samantha Morton , as Emmet 's " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweet revelation . Rarely has a performer mined such complex and potent emotion from such simple materials : a smile , a shrug , an attentive winsomeness . She hardly nods or shakes her head in response to a question , yet always conveys the meaning and feeling . In an age of actors ' tics and rantings , such austere clarity is worth cherishing . The interpretive magic that Emmet Ray achieves with six strings , Morton conjures with none . <P>  --  By Richard Corliss
