<p> " It 's a boy ! " the doctor declared when she delivered Nizama Bektic 's first child six weeks ago . <p> But Bektic did not understand . The Bosnian refugee , who arrived in Atlanta from her war-torn country Aug. 5 , does not speak English . She had no idea what the doctors and nurses were saying . <p> " What is it ? " she asked in Bosnian . " Is it a boy ? " <p> Fortunately , someone in the room could answer in her native language . But it was not anyone on staff at the hospital . Bektic had taken an interpreter along to DeKalb Medical Center when she went into labor at 1 a.m . For almost 11 hours , Elhamija Kadic translated every English word into Bosnian for Bektic and her husband , Elvir . <p> Rest . Push . Relax . Breathe . Push again . Just a little longer now . Everything will be OK . <p> With a big smile on her face , Kadic finally told Bektic what she had been waiting nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said in Bosnian . Bektic , 23 , beamed through tears of joy . <p> " I do n't know what we would have done without her , " she said of Kadic . <p> About 600,000 immigrants and refugees like Bektic have come to Georgia in the past 15 years . Many struggle to understand what is going on when they need health care because very few hospitals and doctor 's offices have interpreters on staff . <p> " It 's definitely up to the patient to bring their own interpreter in this city , " said Barbara Bruno , who has helped to train 150 medical interpreters in the past two years , most of them refugees and immigrants themselves . Many work in health departments or agencies that help newcomers start new lives in America . But most have jobs as receptionists , clerks or caseworkers . They are not paid to be interpreters , but are available if needed . <p> Many hospital administrators say it 's too expensive to have interpreters on staff . Most use the AT &T; Language Line , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . The service is convenient , but expensive at up to $ 4.50 per minute . DeKalb Medical Center , for example , spends about $ 5,000 a year for it . The hospital , not the patient , pays for the service . <p> For in-person interpretation , hospitals rely on bilingual staff members or community volunteers who can help at a moment 's notice . When those options are not available , friends and family members are used to relay information . Sometimes children translate for their parents because the children may learn English before their parents do and often no one else is available . <p> " It happens every day , " said Bruno . " If the child is there and the child speaks the language , that 's who is used . " Medical knowledge a plus Using volunteers can be problematic because the ability to speak a language does not mean one is qualified to interpret medical information . " None of the hospitals I know of has any testing for language skills to see if the person they are using actually has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . <p> And medical interpreters must be familiar with medical procedures so they can describe them to patients . " Even people who speak English may not know what a colostomy is , much less understand consent forms and discharge papers , " said Ana Soler , a certified interpreter who works at Scottish Rite Children 's Medical Center . <p> Patients ' confidentiality rights may be jeopardized if family members are used , immigrant advocates say . Patients may withhold some information if they are embarrassed to discuss it in front of relatives , or relatives may not tell doctors everything if they are embarrassed . <p> It costs more money in the long run if doctors can not communicate with patients , immigrant advocates add . <p> " If you ca n't communicate with your patient , you ca n't get a good diagnosis . You ca n't communicate a treatment plan . Therefore you ca n't expect effective follow-up , " said Cynthia Roat , a medical interpreter from Seattle who has trained interpreters in Atlanta . " They end up back in the hospital . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and St. Joseph 's Hospital do have interpreters on staff because both see a growing number of patients who do n't speak English . <p> " We were seeing that the language barrier was a barrier to receiving and accessing health care , " said Laura Eubanks , an official at Scottish Rite , which has two Spanish-speaking interpreters who handled 1,200 cases last year . About 30 percent of patients there do not speak English . The majority speak Spanish . Vietnamese is the next most prevalent language , and the hospital often pays Vietnamese interpreters to work with those patients . <p> " By having qualified interpreters , patients and families can make informed decisions about their health care , " Eubanks said . <p> St. Joseph 's has three interpreters  --  two who speak Spanish and one who speaks Vietnamese . " Without me , the doctors can not see the patients , " said Chau Hoang , 29 , the Vietnamese interpreter . " The doctors want to see them , it 's just that without an interpreter there 's no way the doctor can diagnose what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of English . My presence is essential for Vietnamese patients . " <p> On a typical day at Scottish Rite , Soler , a native of Colombia , helps six to seven Hispanic families fill out forms , talk to doctors and nurses and navigate through a medical institution they do not understand . She also works the phones , helping doctors and nurses talk to patients who do n't speak English . <p> " I 'm very grateful that she is here . We could not have done this without her , " Alma Marquez said of Soler , who recently spent two hours translating during a hearing test for Marquez 's 6-year-old daughter , also named Alma . The family is from Mexico and does not speak English . <p> Soler 's assistance was so crucial that when she had to leave the room because a doctor had paged her to translate by phone for his Spanish-speaking patient , audiologist Nadia Zebluim had to stop what she was doing . " I think I 'll wait for her to come back , " said Zebluim , who had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers and officials from resettlement agencies that help immigrants say hospitals and doctors ' offices should do more to communicate with patients who do n't speak English . <p> " The need for interpreters is really overwhelming , " said International Rescue Committee director Peter Herbert . He hired Kadic in late October to help thousands of Bosnians who are moving to Atlanta and do not speak English . She already has 19 clients , nine of whom are pregnant . " We have three or four Bosnian families coming in every day who need help with some medical appointment , " Herbert said . <p> Many times , caseworkers whose job is to make doctor appointments end up going along because of the language barrier . Most doctors expect patients to bring their own interpreters , he said . Staff covers 45 languages Hospital officials say they are doing the best they can with limited resources . <p> Mary Kay Kiesling , director of resource services for DeKalb Medical Center , said the hospital has never considered hiring interpreters because it would be expensive and difficult to decide what languages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep them busy all day , " she added . <p> The hospital , which is in Georgia 's most ethnically diverse county , has a Spanish-speaking patient liaison and a list of 171 staff members who speak 45 languages and have agreed to help out as needed . " If we do n't have somebody here who can help , we make every attempt to get an appropriate person , " Kiesling said . <p> DeKalb Medical Center also opened the International Medical Center on Buford Highway in Chamblee this year . It is staffed with doctors , nurses and others who speak eight languages , including Vietnamese , Spanish , Russian , Chinese and Korean . <p> Grady also has a list of bilingual staff members and 10 to 15 volunteers , most of whom are local college students studying foreign languages and who can be paged if needed . It is difficult to get student volunteers to come at night and on weekends , she said . <p> " We answer 500 calls a month " to help patients with limited English , said chaplain Nora Ryan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ways to go yet . We 're not saying we 've perfected it . But we 're a huge institution , so it takes a lot more effort and a lot more coordination to really get it going . " <p> Immigrants who do n't speak English often avoid going to the doctor unless it is an emergency . Because they do n't know the language , it 's often impossible to even make an appointment , social workers said . <p> And because most consent forms are in English only , patients are likely to sign and " just hope for the best " even if they do n't understand what 's going on , said Susy Martorell , a social worker who works with Hispanic immigrants in DeKalb County . <p> " You put your faith in the doctors when you have no other choice , " she said .

The next training will be in early spring . <p> Ana Soler ( right ) translates for Alma Marquez while her daughter , also Alma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JEAN SHIFRIN / Staff Photo TRANSLATE2290213 : Bosnia refugee Nizama Bektic ( left ) relied on translator Elhamija Kadic when she went into labor at DeKalb Medical Center and gave birth to son Enes , now 1 month old . / ALICIA HANSEN / Staff ( Photo ran in Metro Edition only. )
