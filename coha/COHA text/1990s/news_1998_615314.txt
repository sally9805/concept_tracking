<p> Rain , drunken drivers major concerns Brigades with the orange barrels labor when traffic 's the lightest <p> The orange barrels and barricades were to have taken over two lanes of the westbound Stone Mountain Freeway at 7 p.m. , but the paving crew and its state Department of Transportation supervisors are stuck in a nerve-wracking rain delay . <p> And unlike baseball , where they play through some showers , this game is stalled even when there is just a threat of bad weather , as on this blustery , fall-like October Monday . <p> " This material is probably about $ 700 a load , " said Charles Petty , DOT construction project engineer and distant relative of stock car legend Richard Petty . <p> He 's talking about the special DOT-designed Open Grade Friction Course asphalt , a type of long-lasting pavement packed with fibers and polymers to improve traction . " If they get it out here and we get rain , there 's no way it will last until tomorrow night , " he said . <p> So for an hour and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there to repave a five-mile stretch of U.S. 78 . It is one of many such projects under way throughout metro Atlanta in all seasons except winter . Almost all of the work is done at night , mainly to lessen the impact on traffic flow . <p> You 've probably seen paving crews in action  --  workers , trucks , barricades , heavy equipment , bright lights  --  all carefully coordinated to be off the road by rush hour . <p> Rain , though , can unsettle all those elaborate plans . <p> " A rain delay is very expensive for a contractor , " Petty said . On this night on the Stone Mountain Freeway , the contractor feeling the squeeze is Shepherd Construction Co. , which specializes in competing for DOT freeway repaving projects . This one , extending from Montreal Road in Clarkston just outside I-285 to Memorial Drive in Stone Mountain , is costing the state $ 1.46 million and is due for completion Nov. 30 . <p> Danny Baker , Shepherd 's on-site superintendent , periodically jumps into his pickup and leaves tonight 's base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drives to Brockett Road , where it is lightly sprinkling . He consults by cell phone with Shepherd colleagues who are monitoring weather radar . " Glenn Burns said it would stay south of I-20 , " said Petty with a smile . <p> Finally , at 8:33 p.m. , the crew , some of whom have passed the idle time with a friendly poker game , gets the word that work will commence . Immediately , some of the men prepare to spread the barricades that will close lanes . " The most dangerous part is setting up , " said Baker , a young man with a ready smile for whom road construction is a family business . His brother is on this crew and his 71-year-old stepfather is also a Shepherd stalwart . <p> " I always worry , as it gets late , about somebody getting drunk , " said Petty . Baker nods . " It 's just drunk drivers , " he said , that the crews fear most . <p> Within 25 minutes , two lanes are closed for about a one-mile stretch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about two miles of the right-hand westbound lane , and then move across the freeway and pave a short stretch of exit-only lane near the Brockett Road exit . That 's an average night 's work , said Petty . When pushed by deadlines , a crew is capable of paving three to four miles of lane per night , using 80 to 100 14-ton dump truck loads of hot asphalt . <p> With the lanes closed , the crew puts its heavy equipment into operation . At the point where the work is resuming for the night just west of Mountain Industrial , there is an indentation , or seam , where the new pavement ends and where the old asphalt has been milled . <p> Now a black tank truck starts at the seam and from sprayers in the back comes a steaming stream of 400-degree liquid asphalt that will bond the new pavement to the old . <p> " Wherever it touches you , it will take the skin off , " said Petty . " It can take the soles of your shoes off . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There 's a front-end loader that scoops up any excess droppings . The largest machine is called a " shuttle buggy " and holds up to 25 tons of hot asphalt . The shuttle buggy in effect stores the asphalt and moves it back to the asphalt spreader so it does n't have to stop , preventing the creation of problem seams and creases . The dump trucks deposit their loads into the front of the shuttle buggy , both all the time on the move . The drivers put their trucks in neutral and the big buggy pushes them up the road at walking speed for about a minute until the load is dumped . Then it pulls away and the next truck moves into place and the process repeats . Sometimes the dump trucks line up in front of the shuttle buggy like the cars of a freight train . <p> The spreader actually lays the pavement with a platform-like component called the " screed . " It uses computerized sensors to dump the correct amount of pavement along the 12-foot-wide lane . <p> The dump trucks are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trucks are insulated from within and covered with tarps to keep the heat of the mix in and cold air or water out . When the material begins to hit the open loader of the shuttle buggy , steam spews forth in all directions . <p> Ricky Baker , Danny 's brother , is the spreader operator , much admired by Petty because he " pulls a real straight line . " Perched high above the fray , it is terribly hot work , even on a cool evening . " That mix is going to run , temperature-wise , 320 to 330 degrees , " said Petty . " That 's why they like to work at night . Can you imagine sitting in the back of that spreader and it 's 95 degrees and the mix at 330 degrees all day ? " Even near the shuttle buggy and the spreader , it feels like an oven . As the loader creeps on down the freeway , bathed in the surreal glow of fluorescent lights and strobing yellow beacons , two men operating towering rollers carefully smooth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like breakfast cereal in milk . The smoking mix smells a bit like burning rubber , perhaps because of the fibers and polymers , said Petty . <p> After about three passes with the rollers , the surface appears to blend perfectly with the other lanes . In about a week , men will return to lay down reflective " thermo plastic " paint striping and reflectors . <p> From a half-mile away , the crew and its lights look like a cadre of police cruisers and emergency vehicles working a major accident . " I can drive on it in 30 minutes , " said Petty , adding that DOT is hopeful the still experimental mix will last 10 to 12 years . " But it 's going to be hot to the touch for a while . " The caravan moves on the entire night , with work scheduled to end by 6 a.m. as early bird commuters begin rushing onto the freeway . Baker said he thinks the worst nighttime backup the project has caused is about 1 1/2 miles . Tonight there has been no backup at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " traffic is getting bad . " <p> " We try to get out early , especially on this side , " westbound toward Atlanta , said Baker . " There is no convenient time to do construction work , " said Petty with a smile . " We always try to make it as convenient for the public as we can .
