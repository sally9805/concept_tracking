Guidelines for choosing the perfect fencing for your property . BY JOHN H. IN GER SO LL // BACK AT THE DAWN OF TIME , WHEN NEOLITHIC PEOPLE BEGAN TO turn from hunting and gathering to farming , they laid down bermed earth or stone boundary markers to stake out land claims , warn off marauders , and keep livestock from wandering . Erecting fences today shows remnants of that mind-set . On inner-city lots , fencing certainly holds out intruders , or , in modern terms , " enhances security . " But security is usually of less-immediate concern to suburban and exurban families , who more often choose fencing as decorative elements , visual boundary markers , windbreaks , or to define play yards for children . One family in East Lyme , Conn. , for instance , like countless others across the country , surrounded a luxuriant backyard vegetable garden with panels of six-foot-tall woven-wire fencing to prevent deer from eating their bounty . A simple wire fence gate allows family members access to tend and pick vegetables , which they enjoy all season long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rustic fences put twigs and branches from the forest floor to good use . Below : Stakes and pickets are traditional choices for enclosing gardens and hedges : Face the " ugly " side of a fence toward the enclosed portion of your property . Above : Historically , North American homesteaders used trees felled in clearing fields for farmland as split-rail fencing . Right : This " grape-stake " fence in Central California demonstrates one method vintners have long used to support grape vines : wires strung along posts . // Preventing eyesores constitutes another sound reason for fencing . " When you 're faced with an unpleasant sight-the back of a neighboring garage or a commercial enterprise down the street , " says landscape architect Jo Kellum , of Signal Mountain , Tenn. , " you can make your yard look more interesting and even bigger by shielding the view with solid fencing and layering details from the fence inward to create an inner world that 's more interesting . " People erect fencing most often to define property boundaries . Rarely does this unleash a problem between neighbors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build an attractive fence-perhaps a pretty hedge-that serves both families , " observes landscape designer Jodi Tranter , of A-I Landscape Design , Inc. , in Bellingham , Wash . " Even an open-designed , permanent fence is greeted warmly by most neighbors , since it also defines their lot line-at no expense , " she adds . Yet many town planners warn that in order to avoid disputes , your fencing should not straddle the lot line but remain on your side of it . That means , counseled one Connecticut zoning official , that a live fence should be planted in such a way that its future growth does n't overlap or deposit dead leaves and twigs on your neighbor 's side of the property line . Toeing the Line For buyers of formerly owned homes , this may mean paying for an updated survey of the property to be certain just where the lot line is located . Over the years , neighbors may have accidentally-or with benign intent-usurped a portion of the new buyer 's property . Photograph Top : Rollable beach , or snow fencing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sand or snow . Above : Plank and board garden fences discourage trespassing while letting sunlight and breezes in . Right : Three general types of stone fences exist : Foundationless thrown stone walls mark places where farmers used to pile stones as they cleared their fields of them ; mortarless-or " dry " - laid stone fences like this one have foundations to defeat the frost heave and often show great artistry of assembly ; rubble-filled stone fences ( filled with small rocks and debris ) become very sturdy as they settle over the years . // " I encourage people not to surround their entire property with fencing , " declares Jo Kellum . " This tends to make the property look smaller and confining . I would rather see people identify their yard with zones , " she advises . " If they want a private spot with a little fencing , then leave open spaces elsewhere , " she recommends . Nearly all local building codes require fencing around home pools . Chain-link fencing is not the first choice of residential landscape architects . Yet it often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially when cost is the deciding factor ( see " Fencing Choices " on page 64 ) . " When we fence a backyard surrounded by woods , we 'll often use a black-vinyl-coated , woven-wire fence , " says Dave Henderson , owner of Shoreline Fence Co. , in Old Saybrook , Conn . " With trees and undergrowth behind the fence , you can barely see the wire , it blends in so well . " Many building codes limit residential fencing to six feet in height . Some communities allow openwork above six feet . For example , in the Bellingham , Wash. , area , a trellis atop a six-foot fence can push the total height to seven and a half feet , according to Jodi Tranter . " Then we usually train vines through the trellis , " she adds . " To keep kids safe and pets from wandering off , backyard fencing ought to be at least five feet high , " Tranter added . " Anything less tempts youngsters to climb over , and dogs to leap over , the fence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground so neither children nor dogs squirm under the fence . In fact , many dog owners bury the bottom of a fence one half foot or so in the ground to prevent their pets from digging under the fence . Burying the bottom of the fence , Tranter adds , also acts as a weed barrier and makes for a neat edge along the fence line . Install It Yourself Your best source for fencing is a company specializing in its sale and installation . Generally such companies have a larger choice of materials and fence designs than the selection at home centers , plus installation specialists . If you wish , you can buy materials from a fence company or a home center and install them yourself . But be forewarned : Installing a fence properly can be hard work . " Nearly 40 percent of our customers who intend to do the work on their own call us later to find out how much more it costs to have us do the job , " Dave Henderson notes . " We usually end up installing the fencing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appearance of a property . " Handsome fencing and attractive landscaping seem to go hand in hand , " observes Jo Kellum . " A good design is often catching . When one family spruces up their yard , others follow . " And as Robert Frost wrote long ago , " Good fences make good neighbors . " EX Sidebar Fencing Choices Sidebar THE FOLLOWING MATERIALS LIST IS ARRANGED in approximate order of cost , from highest to lowest . Living , vinyl , and wood fences cost Sidebar about the same . Note that owing to labor and materials costs , prices vary widely across the nation . Stone and brick : Stone walls rarely stand more than three feet high and from two to three feet wide at the base . Stone or brick fences cemented with mortar can be thin or thick , high or low , as you wish . Sidebar Metal : Use cast or wrought iron to border patios , mark out garden paths , or define the front lot line . Aluminum fencing offers good looks at a lower cost . Living fence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regular care . Space young plants to allow for healthy growth . Vinyl : " No need to paint " is probably the No. 1 reason white vinyl fencing is popular today . Premium vinyl fencing resists fading or discoloration from sunlight for 20 years , industry professionals say 40 years if power-washed regularly . Many styles are offered . Wood : Western red cedar , redwood , southern yellow pine , eastern white cedar , eastern hemlock , and cypress are easily adaptable for above-ground portions of wooden fencing . To eliminate worry over decay , it 's best to consider pressure-treated lumber for fence posts . Wire : The spacing of woven wire ranges from insect-screen size to openings six inches square . Wire coated with colored plastic resists rusting . Chain-link squares are thicker and usually have square angles pointed toward the ground .
