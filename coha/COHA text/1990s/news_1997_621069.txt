<p> Facing the tightest job market in decades , PG &E; plans to mine a group once thought unemployable by corporate America : welfare recipients . <p> As part of its new welfare-to-work program beginning this Monday , PG &E; wo n't simply pluck people off the rolls , plop them into cubicles at its Beale Street tower in San Francisco and start handing out checks . <p> Instead , the pilot project aims to take these potential employees each step along a lengthy path toward finding  --  and keeping  --  jobs . The recipients will have everything from baby-sitters to bus fare taken care of so they can concentrate on entering the workforce . <p> " You have no excuse not to go to work , " said Lisa Bolds , one of 28 women and men on welfare participating in PG &E's; program . " There are no outs . No excuses . " <p> Project organizers say the collective efforts of the utility and nonprofit groups , city agencies and colleges make PG &E's; program the largest and most comprehensive welfare-to-work initiative in the Bay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a handful of large companies in the nation to not only offer jobs to welfare clients but to ensure they 're ready for the workplace . <p> " What 's really different about this program is that employers are not saying , ' Give us employees who are ready to work , ' " said Patrick Duterte , head of the employment and training services division of the San Francisco Department of Human Services . <p> " They 're actually making sure that they 're involved before the people come through the door , " he said . <p> To be sure , the PG &E; program is not the first to employ welfare recipients . Large firms , such as United Airlines , Marriott International and Sprint , have already made hiring people on welfare a matter of corporate policy . <p> But Duterte said PG &E; is the first public company to develop such extensive partnerships with the public sector to ensure welfare recipients are ready for the workplace . In fact , he said this kind of private-public partnership could well become the corporate model for tackling the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initiative comes at a time when the competition for workers is heating up and more welfare recipients are entering the job market . <p> Dan Quigley , manager of corporate contributions at PG &E; and head of its welfare-to-work program , said it 's only natural that companies take advantage of these converging trends . <p> " ( Welfare-to-work ) is n't going to become a charitable activity but a business activity : how to identify qualified candidates from as many different places as possible , " Quigley said . " This is n't a one- shot thing . " <p> Last August , President Clinton signed into law a historic welfare bill that would require able-bodied recipients to find work after two years on federal aid . Just last week , Clinton announced that 1.4 million people nationwide have left welfare since he signed the law . <p> In California , the clock is ticking for the state 's 2.5 million welfare recipients , including about 114,000 in the Bay Area . <p> " The most important thing we can do is get the private sector to hire people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the president touted the Welfare to Work Partnership , a not-for-profit entity he created to spur businesses to create millions of jobs for former recipients . <p> In braving the nascent waters of welfare-to-work initiatives , PG &E; has learned that it takes a collective effort . To that end , the electric power company has established partnerships with DHS , City College of San Francisco , the nonprofit Women 's Foundation and employment agency Roberta Enterprises CORESTAFF . <p> " The private sector has more to offer than just jobs , " added Julie Brandt , area manager for PG &E's; San Francisco community relations department . " They can lend resources . They can be a training ground to see what works and what does n't work . " <p> Katherine Ferguson , a program participant who has been on welfare for two years , said she was happily " shocked " to realize the extent of PG &E's; involvement . <p> " There should be no reason why every single person ca n't get off assistance " through this program , Ferguson said . " They 're giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple . " <p> Along with 27 others , Ferguson will begin training on Monday at City College 's downtown campus . Those who finish the rigorous classroom courses will start work as temporary office clerks or secretaries at PG &E; in early March . They will be paid from $ 12.10 to $ 17 per hour . After working at least six months at PG &E,; some of the new recruits will move into permanent positions . The company has pledged to help those who do n't stay on find work at other firms . <p> PG &E; is contributing $ 200,000 in cash toward the project , while the other partners will manage the day-to-day activities and provide support services such as transportation and child care . <p> Besides six months of computer and clerical training , the program will teach workers such " soft skills , " as dressing appropriately , showing up to work on time , balancing a checkbook and even grooming . <p> For PG &E,; finding out what works and what does n't has been a long , hard struggle . " This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the partnerships together was a learning experience . " <p> Brandt and a team of other employees at PG &E; began in January the arduous task of creating a welfare-to-work program from scratch . Over the next couple of months , they met with dozens of companies and social service organizations . In the end , PG &E; formed alliances with several key players . One of the first was with the Women 's Foundation , a nonprofit organization in San Francisco that serves mostly low-income women and their children . Because the foundation serves the same population PG &E; wanted to target , it was considered the ideal organization to run the program on a day-to-day basis . <p> " If you 're from the corporate side , it 's more difficult for you to understand the problems of welfare recipients , " said foundation executive director Patricia Chang . " But by making these partnerships , we 're able to determine the problems and together , form the solutions . " <p> For child care , health care and transportation needs , PG &E; turned next to the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infrastructure to offer these resources . Among other things , the department sent out flyers advertising PG &E's; program with its monthly welfare checks . <p> Then City College of San Francisco , which had long offered adult classes in career management and life skills , agreed to provide classroom facilities . <p> Finally , PG &E; picked Roberta Enterprises , one of its contracted temporary employment agencies , to place the recipients into its temporary workforce after they finished the training program . <p> Robert Loomis , who manages PG &E's; team of temporary employment agencies , noted that the recipients face a hard struggle getting from welfare to work because the expectations for workers have changed . <p> " Three years ago , most of the temp jobs were envelope stuffers or people putting up a rack in a store , " Loomis said . " Well now ( employers ) call and they want people with Word , Excel and PowerPoint ( experience ) . " <p> With so many pieces to the puzzle , there was a lot of gnashing of teeth and countless meetings to hammer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Needless to say , cooperation among the many partners in the program , was vital to make the program work . <p> " You have to make ( welfare-to-work ) seamless for people , " Duterte said . " The commitment of the business community to hire welfare clients is only as good as they get good workers and it 's easy to do . " <p> PG &E; officials said they might expand the pilot project beyond San Francisco if it proves successful . And the number of participants will also likely increase . If nothing else , PG &E's; Brandt said , other companies will learn from the firm 's efforts .
