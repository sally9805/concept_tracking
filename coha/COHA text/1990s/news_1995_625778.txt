<p> Re : the Kinsey Report <p> I 'm grateful that U.S. Rep. Steve Stockman , R-Friendswood , has introduced legislation to initiate investigation of the Kinsey Report . <p> Dr. Kinsey included in his research the infamous Table 34 , where children as young as five months old were manipulated to orgasms continuously over periods of time , some up to a 24-hour period . <p> On Dec. 5 , the Chronicle reported that this detailed study was obtained from an interview with a pedophile . I find it difficult to believe that a pedophile would keep such detailed records of his innocent victims ' forced and repeated reactions . And since when do we trust the word of a pedophile for scientific research and documentation on children 's sexuality ? <p> If Stockman 's bill is never passed , it has been worth it to educate the public to the true nature of Dr. Kinsey 's research group . May we not base our children 's sex education on findings from the " " Kinsey Report . " <p> Patricia Musgrave , Seabrook <p> After learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the role of the Kinsey Report on sex education , I called his office in Galveston . I told the woman who answered that I felt this matter was not worth spending tax dollars on , and that I would prefer that Stockman address the more urgent business of the budget and Bosnia . <p> Imagine my surprise when the woman launched into a tirade about how Kinsey had permeated secondary sex education in the nation . Her rudeness shocked me to the point that I felt it necessary to call Stockman 's Washington office . The man who took my call was not conciliatory at all . He immediately jumped all over me for questioning the need to explore this matter . <p> It is said that the best defense is a strong offense . These so-called civil servants were definitely offensive . <p> Mrs. Glenn Selman , Texas City <p> Long ago , experiments were done on humans concerning radiation . The press call for an investigation of the V.A . health-care system 's handling of this tainted study . <p> Long ago , a group of black men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would happen with the disease 's natural course . The press was understandably outraged - as were most right-thinking Americans . <p> Neither study resulted in an on-going teaching of the pathological warped mind set which started these studies . <p> Now , the Chronicle blasts Rep. Steve Stockman for wanting to evaluate the Kinsey Report ( Editorial page , Dec. 12 ) . You pass the study off as some long ago event by a " " now dead " researcher . <p> Unlike the V.A . radiation and Tuskegee studies , the pathologcal world view of the Kinsey Report pervades today 's psychriatic teaching and sex education in schools . <p> In a country that has spent millions on irrelevant research , Stockman 's call for investigation is in order . Allow the taxpayer/parent to see what is happening in our schools - and its origins . <p> Robert W. Feldtman , Houston <p> Some kooky reasoning <p> The Chronicle acknowledges that any child with a computer and a modem can access sexually or violently explicit material ( Editorial page , Dec. 12 ) . <p> You say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitutional freedom of speech rights . Your logic is bologna sausage . When our Founding Fathers guaranteed our freedom of speech rights , they were not referring to children being allowed to look at this stuff . <p> Your sophisticated-sounding reasoning is garbage . Such kooky reasoning will help turn our society into a garbage pit . <p> Daniel Werchowski , Houston <p> Double standard lives <p> Once again the liberals prove that they are the party of the double standard . In his Dec. 7 Outlook article , Robert Scheer would have us believe that House Speaker Newt Gingrich is a cross between Joe McCarthy and Jack the Ripper , intimating that he committed the most egregious crimes of all time . <p> However , Gingrich , unlike the Clintons , has stated that he will cooperate fully with the investigation as he has nothing to hide . However , when Whitewater is mentioned , the liberals state ( in unison ) that it happened a long time ago , it is a partisan attack , it is a witch hunt , no one understands it , etc . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lying , stonewalling and noncooperation . <p> The double standard lives . <p> Robert B. Herrick , Houston <p> Look at our drug laws <p> Jerry Epstein correctly identifies the greatest failure of our stupid drug laws and the so-called " " war on drugs " ( Viewpoints , Dec. 8 ) . <p> They may make good headlines and great political rhetoric , but like prohibition on alcohol , are doomed to create a black market that only intensifies the problem . <p> It 's time to take another look at our drug laws and realize that America does not have a totalitarian government , except possibly in some of the zealous search and seizure efforts of the drug gestapo . <p> Most " " recreational " drugs are not nearly as dangerous as many politicians proclaim . They need to be decriminalized . <p> Frank Prahl , Pasadena <p> Trouble in Cy-Fair <p> Finally the Cypress-Fairbanks issue is settled , or is it ? We resided in this school district from 1988-92 and were planning to return to the community in January of this year when we moved back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the initial vote on the bond and year-round school issue . As a businessman I understand the dilemma that faced school administrators . Either raise additional funds ( higher taxes ) , reduce benefits ( fewer teachers , books , computers , etc. ) or better utilize the assets one owns . <p> While we were not overly excited about the year-round concept in the beginning ( we had a daughter in grade school and a son in junior high ) , we voted for the year-round option , because it appeared to offer the best solution . Unfortunately , this set off the worst tirade from disgruntled parents ( they were the minority , and might still be among registered voters in the community ) I have ever witnessed . <p> When we returned to Houston we rented an apartment in the Cy-Fair area while we shopped for a place to build a home . <p> Once we saw how the dispute has evolved over the past three years , we hightailed it to the Katy area and built our home there . <p> The Cy-Fair community is still a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , they are right back where they started . Thank goodness we do not have to live with it . <p> Larry Albert , Katy <p> What a performance <p> U.S. Rep. Enid Greene Waldholtz , R-Utah , should be nominated to receive the " " Jimmy Swaggart Award " for the best performance by a politician to cleanse ( with tears ) their actions of any personal responsibility . <p> Waldholtz deserves credit for not claiming to have received a " " message from God " to violate the campaign finance laws . <p> Further , she did not claim that the " " devil made her do it . " It was her love and trust for her husband and the desire for an exquisite home away from home that caused her to completely let her guard down . <p> There was no mention about winning the election at all costs . <p> Could this have been a case of " " win one for the Newt " ? <p> Wayne Gore , Broaddus <p> Do n't like the risks ? <p> I am really amazed at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to the speed limit being raised . <p> Why were none of these commentators pushing for a reduction of the limit sometime during the past couple of decades ? Surely a reduction to 45 mph would have saved many more thousands of people 's lives . Why stop at 45 ? We could save all deaths by automobiles by outlawing those deadly contraptions . <p> If you can not accept the risks of automobile travel , may I suggest a horse ? <p> Bryan J.
