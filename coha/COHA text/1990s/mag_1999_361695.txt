Back in 1988 , Jim Hightower , a razor-tongued Texas democrat , amused the nation by saying presidential candidate George Bush was a man " born on third base who thought he had hit a triple . " Hightower was only a little bit right . <P> Bush was born intelligent , healthy , handsome , tastefully wealthy , with the best social and school connections and a lust for adventure , to a mother and father who taught him the virtue of public service . So he may have been born closer to home plate than even Hightower suggested . <P> But Bush always knew this . He rode his privilege joyously through these first 75 years but always with good humor , and every step of the way he thanked God and anybody else within earshot for " being the luckiest guy on earth . " His constant awe about his luck may have been one reason he did not win a second presidential term , but once again Providence may have been dealing out a lucky hand , clearing the way for a new generation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power  --  patriarch of history 's most commanding family in American public life , beyond the Adamses , the Harrisons , the Roosevelts and the Kennedys . Home plate may be only a step away . <P> So there he was in full birthday mode last week , munching a Morton 's roast-beef sandwich after tumbling wildly through 5,000 feet of Texas sky . He was so blissful up there , he missed his skydiving instructor Glenn Bangs ' signal to pull his rip cord . ( Bush 's other parachuting companion , Andy Serrano , pulled it . ) " What a high ! " he laughed as his promise to Barbara not to jump again slipped away with each memory of touching the clouds in free fall . <P> After a whole week of 75th-birthday hoopla , as he sent his son George W. Bush off to run for the presidency , he seemed ( almost ) ready to move on . " I do n't think in terms of a dynasty or a great legacy , " he said . " I think in terms of family . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running for President and the possibility of him being in the White House will affect me . It wo n't impact me that much . I 've been there . I 've done that . I 'm not entitled to a damn thing . It is their turn now . " <P> Their turn ? Often these days when Bush talks about the coming political era , he inadvertently ( or maybe not ) lumps together both his political boys , George W. and Florida 's Governor Jeb Bush , as if they might be coupled in some inexorable public caravan carrying them down the White House road . President Bush will only allow the slightest look into that corner of his heart : " I think Jeb will be on the national scene some day . " <P> When Bush read the comment that his eldest would at last be ushered into " the big leagues " by campaigning in Iowa , he managed a wry smile . " Both boys have seen it all up close , " he said . " They went through a tough time in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fought back . They stood loyally with me . That conditioned them . They know how tough it can be . And they are both better equipped for it . George W. will never be complacent . He 's seen things go up , he 's seen things go down . "
