As automobile traffic turns parks into parking lots , transportation alternatives are urgently needed . <p> WHEN JAMES BRYCE , the British Ambassador to the United States , visited Yosemite National Park in 1912 , he warned of a menace that would soon overtake Yosemite and other national parks . <p> " If you were to realize what the result of the automobile will be in that wonderful , that incomparable valley , you will keep it out , " he said . <p> Although automobiles were not allowed into the national parks at the time of Bryce 's words , public pressure to change the policy mounted as vehicles became more reliable and affordable . Within a year , the first automobiles sputtered into Yosemite , and now eight decades later , Park Superintendent Mike Finley is facing the consequences . When Finley inspects the magnificent Yosemite Valley during summer afternoons , he sees traffic gridlock with its choking exhaust . And instead of the open fields and meadows that once filled the valley , he finds asphalt and 5,500 parking spaces . " Let 's face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road system , " says George Berklacy , chief spokesman for the Park Service in Washington , D.C. " It 's a giant parking lot . " <p> Although Yosemite may indeed be facing the greatest transportation challenge in the National Park System , it is hardly alone . " Few parks have managed to escape the impact of the car , " says Laura Loomis , deputy director of conservation programs for the National Parks and Conservation Association . <p> A look at five national parks reveals the extent of the problem . <p> Along the South Rim of Grand Canyon National Park in Arizona , snarled traffic exacerbates air pollution so severe that haze hangs over some trademark views like a cataract . <p> At Great Smoky Mountains National Park in Tennessee , nearly 3.6 million vehicles  --  an increase of more than one . million in the last decade  --  pass through the gates annually , causing gridlock on busy days . Over the past 30 years , visibility has dwindled from 3 0 miles to 15 miles , while rising ozone levels have damaged an estimated 70 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months at Acadia National Park in Maine combines with airborne pollution to create hazardous ozone levels that threaten sensitive trees and other plant life and trigger health warnings at park entrance stations . <p> At Shenandoah National Park in Virginia , heavy traffic  --  particularly during autumn months when visitors drive through the park to view foliage-adds to the pollution that has been identified as the number one threat to the park . In addition , park officials last year reported a record number of accidents . Two-thirds of the 150 collisions involved deer . <p> The road system throughout Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming is crumbling and will cost taxpayers a minimum of $300 million to fix . Experts say that once construction is completed , the mammoth repair task will have to start anew , because the life span of an average park road is less than 30 years . <p> In nearly a century , accommodating America 's dual love affair with the national parks and the automobile has produced expensive highway networks , as well as maintenance budgets that dwarf the expenditures funneled into resource protection , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ includes 1,460 associated bridges and tunnels and 7,927 miles of roads , of which 4,860 miles are paved . In 1981 a Park Service survey estimated that 19 percent of all park system roads were in poor condition . Following a decade of increased visitation , decreased funding , and deferred maintenance , 33 percent of the park system roads were in poor or failed condition , prompting safety concerns from the Federal Highway Administration . NPCA 's Loomis says , " In all parks , we are seeing visitation increase annually at rates of 3 to 10 percent , and yet we have park road systems designed for traffic volumes from 50 years ago . " <p> The latest cost estimates for road rebuilding and repair are $1.5 billion , a dollar amount equal to the Park Service 's annual operating budget , says Jim Straughan , who oversees the Park Service 's Denver-based transportation branch . The outlook is not good . Congress is expected to appropriate a total of $486 million over the next four years , less than half of what is needed . Consequently , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the century , when the tab for bringing them up to federal standards will have increased to at least $2 billion , says Straughan . <p> This is just a glimpse of the toll . The large western parks that come under the jurisdiction of the Park Service 's Rocky Mountain region suffer the most from a cash shortfall . Their road repair bill exceeds $470 million . " At the rate we 're going , our road troubles are not going to be resolved , " said Cam Hugie , regional maintenance chief . " It 's deplorable for areas of national significance to be in that condition . " <p> Although insufficient funds to repair the roads are part of the problem , replacing the roads is not the only way to improve transportation . But getting away from auto-dependent systems requires revolutionary thinking and a willingness to change . <p> According to NPCA 's Loomis , the vacation of the future may no longer involve loading up the family vehicle and setting out across the country to a series of drive-through parks . " We 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking about how we visit our parks , " she said . Some may not be willing to accept Loomis ' assessment , but even transportation experts with the Park Service confess that maintenance and repair problems are of epic proportions . <p> In addition to the costs to repair roads , car-dependent transportation systems exacerbate pollution , carve up parkland , and may even conflict with the philosophy of the Park Service . <p> Indeed , the Park Service 's recent 135-page Vail Agenda report  --  for which a team of independent experts was asked to review the state of the national parks  --  suggests that transportation and its supporting infrastructure conflict with park values . <p> " The Steering Committee recognizes that providing for public access and public enjoyment and enlightenment , on the one hand , and protecting park resources and values , on the other , often come into conflict . Visitors to park units use park resources : they take up space , they require transportation , food , shelter , waste facilities , traffic control , viewing areas , and so on ... The Service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for needed facilities such as trails , overlooks , transportation systems , visitor centers , and campgrounds , " wrote the experts in the report , which was delivered for the Park Service 's 75th anniversary last year . <p> NPCA has long been a proponent of establishing thresholds for the number of people who can experience the park without compromising its resources . The association devised Visitor Impact Management studies as a method of assessing how visitors affect the parks . Such an approach was mandated by Congress in 1978 , when it passed the Parks and Recreation Act . But demographics , not federal law , has served as more of a catalyst for change . With California 's population swelling to 30 million residents , pressure on Yosemite has forced park managers to consider extreme measures such as closing Yosemite Valley to all private cars . <p> A report by The Wilderness Society titled Traffic Problems in the National Parks supported closing down the valley . It also advocated " staging areas " where visitors could leave vehicles and use public transportation systems . NPCA and other conservationist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Others have faulted the federal agency for failing to implement recommendations and claim that , by not taking preventive action decades ago , park managers in Yosemite now must close stretches of highway when they become too crowded . <p> Agency planners admit that highways in Yosemite already are exceeding their capacity for shuttle buses , but the alternatives are few . And Finley warns that eliminating cars in favor of a more extensive shuttle bus system will not solve all problems . " Does a shuttle bus system really address the needs of anglers who want to be out there and fish at first light ; or the photographer who wants freedom to wait for a perfect shot ; or a hiker who does not want to be dropped off at the trailhead in a surge of 40 people ? " Finley asked . <p> Finley also points out that establishing staging areas may take more land out of its natural state and could mean greater costs . " It means building a larger bus fleet and more staff and maintenance costs . Who is going to pay for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience ? " <p> Another problem relates to asphalt . Staging area parking lots could be extensive . " That is a dilemma , " says NPCA 's Loomis . " If you do make people abandon their cars , you would n't want them to encounter a huge expanse of pavement . Right now , the Park Service does n't have a clear policy on where it wants to go . As a consequence , it 's trying to merely patch up obvious problems that require long-term thinking . We have to rethink the way we make parks accessible to visitors and examine the most cost-effective methods of mass transit that can be employed . " <p> Advocates of public transportation gained an unlikely ally last year , when Sen. Malcolm Wallop , a conservative Wyoming Republican , initiated legislation for a $240,000 study of park transportation problems . The study is to be completed by the end of 1992 . The late Walt Disney , who made monorails a centerpiece of his popular California and Florida theme parks , provided the inspiration for Wallop 's bill . The legislation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternative transit systems in three locations : Yosemite , Yellowstone , and Denali National Park and Preserve in Alaska . <p> Thirty years ago , drawing comparisons between the Magic Kingdom and America 's crown jewels would have been regarded as sacrilege by the environmental community . But Wallop 's fondness for Disney 's monorails is based on a premise with which most conservationists agree . Studies in Great Smoky Mountains National Park show that the average visitor spends seven times as many hours inside the car as out of it ; 16 percent of visitors never turn off the car 's engine . Consider Wallop 's theory about Disney . " There are some things the private sector has pioneered that the public sector has yet to learn , and one of them is the ability to separate Americans from their cars and make them enjoy it , " Wallop says . " Disney does this better than anyone . As our parks become overcrowded , the infrastructures will continue to collapse . This has led to environmental degradation , because some parks simply can not handle the tremendous volume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups praise Wallop 's search for creative solutions , their support is tempered with caution . Rather than use trains , buses , or monorails to replace cars , the senator suggests adding them to the existing system . Conservation groups say this approach is unacceptable , because it would only increase the burdens associated with infrastructure maintenance . The question remains : how would an agency that suffers from chronic funding shortfalls pay for alternative transportation ? Park Service economists say the average cost of building a paved highway is about $1 million a mile . Conservative estimates place monorail construction and maintenance costs between $15 million and $50 million a mile , a price tag unrealistic for parks such as Yellowstone . <p> John Gingles , the Park Service deputy chief of engineering and safety , believes the conclusion of Wallop 's transportation study will rule out monorails . " Environmentally , we 're not going to carve out new corridors in the landscape for monorails . It 's out of the question , " he said . " On the other hand , we know there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the number of visitors . We tried to limit use in Yosemite but ran into a political firestorm . " <p> Gingles said he and many of his colleagues support a 30-year moratorium on all new development in national parks so that transportation troubles can be resolved . " At a time when we should be looking at tightening up and putting limits on visitor use , Congress is building more facilities in our parks and adding to the trouble , " he said . " We 're trying to put more people and automobiles into parks , but we do n't have any idea what the impacts are to resources , because a solid research base is lacking . " <p> So what are the options ? " Whether you and I like it or not , cars are going to be with us for several decades , " says Gingles . " It 's almost an unsolvable problem as long as the public insists on seeing the parks from behind the windshield of their own vehicles . " Seventy-five years ago , he noted , visitors to Yellowstone were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chain them to a tree . It was the only certain method of convincing them that the cars would be secure while they rode stagecoaches into the park interior . " We need to encourage people to think beyond the car . That 's the only hope we have , " Gingles says . <p> Those same sentiments were voiced in Yosemite Valley a long time ago by a British ambassador . If only someone had heard his advice over the coming roar of the horseless carriage . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Overuse contributes to the poor condition of park roads .
