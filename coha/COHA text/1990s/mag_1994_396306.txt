My hopes soared when it was announced that Hillary Rodham Clinton was in charge of designing a national health plan . I admire her intelligence and her self-assurance and I was impressed with the way she went around the country asking people to share their experiences and soliciting their advice . I wish I could be as enthusiastic about the health plan she and her advisers came up with . The best thing about the Clinton health plan , now known as the Health Security Act ( HSA ) , is its promise of comprehensive benefits coverage for all . If Congress approved this bill , it would end the national disgrace of nearly 39 million people with no insurance and another 23 million with inadequate coverage ; by 1998 all legal residents would be covered . No one would be bankrupted by medical bills or caught in the " job lock " or " welfare lock " that inhibits people from moving or leaving jobs for fear of losing health insurance or Medicaid . People would no longer be turned down by insurance companies for " preexisting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abuse , and pregnancy-related services would be among the benefits covered . The HSA would reduce the oversupply of medical specialists  --  over two thirds of all physicians  --  who inflate medical costs with more tests and procedures and higher fees than primary care doctors . Changes in the reimbursement system may encourage more physicians to provide primary care , as may a reduction in residency training programs . There is also the promise of residency training programs . There is also the promise of expanded use of health professionals from women-dominated fields , specifically nurses with advanced training . ( According to evidence cited in a 1986 report by the Office of Technology Assessment , 60 to 80 percent of the basic care given by doctors could be performed with equal results and lower costs by nurse practitioners . ) The Clintons have n't been reticent about speaking out against price gouging by the pharmaceutical industry . Even before reaching the Oval Office , Bill Clinton leveled a strong attack on the industry , pointing out that U.S. consumers are charged three times the amount people in other countries pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offering coverage for prescription drugs , the plan thus overcomes one of the deficiencies of Medicare . Then there 's the nightmare of insurance paperwork ( $1 out of every $4 spent on medical care goes to administration ) . The HSA is supposed to cut through the red tape by giving everyone a health security card and requiring all plans to adopt a standard claim form to replace the hundreds that exist today . The HSA taps both fear and anger in many physicians . The profession has long functioned as a cottage industry largely free of oversight , and its membership , in general , fears a loss of autonomy . Angered further by the administration 's suggestion that physicians be more accountable to the public they serve , the American Medical Association ( AMA ) has urged doctors to lobby their patients to oppose the promised cap on insurance premiums and cuts in growth of Medicare and Medicaid . The AMA asserts  --  and here 's my favorite part  --  that its position reflects physicians ' concern for patient welfare , not just their own economic interests . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hates it . The pharmaceutical industry is on the defensive . What 's not to like ? My biggest problem is that it 's primarily a means of getting the bills paid . It 's more of an insurance mandate than health care reform . When the designers unveiled their plan last fall , it was apparent that had incorporated some of the largely untried theories of " managed competition . " According to those theories , consumers would strengthen their purchasing power by joining cooperatives , or health alliances , to bargain for the best deal in hospital rates , prescription drugs , and doctor fees . Health providers would be forced to compete for customers , thus supposedly lowering the cost of care while preserving quality . But the HSA would also create insurance behemoths : after large health alliances are formed , only a few insurance companies will be needed and the power will be concentrated in the largest companies , such as Cigna , Aetna , and Prudential . I might as well put my personal biases on the table . I do n't see any relationship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In fact , many of my encounters with the medical system have actually compromised my health . I 'm thinking of the " routine " hospital chest X ray I was given as a nursing mother two days after giving birth ; and the hysterectomy offered at the age of 33 ( You have all the children you want , what do you need that thing for ? " ) . And of course there 's the influence of my 17 years of work as a medical consumer advocate : I am continually struck by the lack of science supporting common medical practices and how the overtreatment of women escalates despite increased public awareness . But more on that later . Think of many of the factors that contribute to good health : not living in poverty ; having adequate housing ; eating nutritious food ; working at a decent job ; driving no faster than 55 miles an hour and wearing a safety belt ; not smoking ; not living with a violent person ; avoiding alcohol and drug addiction ; exercising regularly ; having access to safe birth control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Few are related to medical care . And as more and more people sink below the poverty level , as handguns and assault weapons proliferate , as the war on drugs continues to be lost , personal responsibility and the medical care system have less and less to do with maintaining the health of the nation . " The number one public health problem of a baby born today is violence , " says Mark Rosenberg of the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control . My problem with the HSA cut to the heart of how we as a nation perceive health and how we go about improving everyone 's health status . The two universal standards used to measure the health of a nation are longevity and infant mortality . Public health experts generally agree that longevity has little to do with access to medical care . Countries like Costa Rica and China with per capita medical care spending far below ours show an average life span roughly similar to that of people in the U.S. And with the highest per capita medical spending in the world , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other countries . Those who argue that the access to prenatal care promised by the HSA provides the solution ignore the experience of other countries with long histories of universal access . Women in the United Kingdom have had access to prenatal care for 40 years , but infant mortality among poor people is triple that of upper-income people . Racism and poverty , rather than medical spending , are the determining factors in infant survival rates , and women make up close to two thirds of the adults living in poverty in the U.S. Any serious attempt to reform medical care must eliminate the possibility of a two-tiered medical system in which poor people receive one kind of care and the well-off another . The HSA is tied to employment with , on average , 80 percent of the plan paid by employers while consumers , tax credits , direct taxes , and federal subsidies ( for low-wage earners ) make up the difference . In proposing three different health plans the HSA establishes tiers : pay only $10 a visit and ( most likely ) be restricted to providers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20 percent co-payment and choose any provider as part of the traditional fee-for-service plan ; or pay $10 a visit to providers within the plan and a 20 percent co-payment for services outside the plan . Only the least expensive option resembles health maintenance organizations ( HMOs ) , which restrict care entirely to providers within the plan . By paying a small payroll tax , corporations with more than 5,000 employees can form their own alliances and choose the plan(s) they want . The HSA is complex and may ell prove to be a bureaucratic nightmare . By one estimate 200 workers will be required to administer a one-million-member alliance . Ideally , rich and poor , high- and low-risk , employed , unemployed , and self-employed people can join the same alliance . But some experts anticipate regional " wars " as the middle class fights to have alliance boundaries drawn to avoid absorbing huge numbers of people who were formerly on Medicaid . And states with large immigrant populations are alarmed that the HSA will not cover undocumented immigrants . But to date a far more important question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bills and controlling the escalating cost of medical care , soon to reach the $1 trillion-a-year mark : What will be done about reforming the practice of medicine ? Instead of tackling the reform issue head-on , the HSA ( and most of the competing plans ) propose a National Health Board , patterned after the successful equivalent in Canada , which sets standards and reviews unreasonable prescription drug fees . But much more must be done to control inappropriate prescribing practices , excessive testing , unnecessary surgery , and the use of implanted devices such as breast implants . The most obvious way to control escalating costs is to take on the issue of unnecessary treatment . Directing safety and efficacy questions at the billion-dollar-a-year infertility industry , for example , might force specialists to admit the lack of clinical trials to support their widely used tests and therapies . Reforms must go beyond reducing economic incentives . HMOs , with their built-in review processes and salaried doctors , have n't controlled the rate of unnecessary hysterectomy , for example . Nor has the single-payer system done much to stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate is close to that of the U.S. And reformers must address the rampant problem of physicians who ignore clinical trial results ; for example , most women newly diagnosed with breast cancer continue to be treated with mastectomy nine years after a nationwide clinical trial showed that breast-sparing treatment ( lumpectomy plus radiation therapy ) has the same survival rate . Obviously , the promises and structure of the plan are likely to undergo major changes and compromises as the public continues to react and the bill slogs its way through Congress . To use but one volatile example : the question of whether abortion is to be included in the basic gynecological care promised to women will , no doubt , be subject to protracted debate . If the president and Congress cave in on this issue , insured women of childbearing age will he worse off than they are today , since most private insurance plans cover abortion . Frankly , I am hoping that the sheer complexity of the HSA will force a thorough public discussion of the merits of the Canadian single-payer system . Although the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HSA does offer states the option of implementing their own single-payer plans that would avoid alliances and pay all residents ' medical bills . It 's too bad so little media attention was given to the U.S. General Accounting Office 's ( GAO ) favorable 1991 report on the Canadian medical system . Insurance companies are eliminated by this tax-supported system referred to as " single-payer " because all hospital and doctor bills are paid entirely by the government of each province . Physicians are paid according to a uniform fee schedule negotiated by their peers . Special interest groups have portrayed the system as socialized medicine , but 95 percent of Canadian physicians work for themselves . There 's no two-tier system , and everyone has access to the same medical care and to doctors of their own choosing . And the system keeps administrative costs to less than half of those currently incurred in the U.S. " If the universal coverage and single-payer features of the Canadian system were applied to the U.S. , " reported the GAO , " the savings ... would be more than enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uninsured . " As for me , I 'm willing to pay higher taxes so that all people in this country can receive the same basic coverage and so that I 'll never have to worry about medical bankruptcy . I like the idea of a government employee paying my medical bills for me . THE PLAN : A REPORT CARE Many proposals in the Clinton health plan represent positive and important advances for women and would expand access to health care for millions of women . The following elements deserve special note : * Universal coverage because women ( the highest proportion of part-time workers and largest group of poor people ) are often left without care . * The comprehensive benefits package , especially the inclusion of free prenatal care and regularly scheduled preventive and early detection services , including Pap smears and mammography ; prescription drug coverage ; inclusion of birth control ; screening and treating sexually transmitted diseases ( including HIV/AIDS ) ; and , if the language is broadly interpreted , abortion services . * Offering mental health and substance abuse benefits . Also coverage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mental health services by 2003. * The introduction of cost containment , placing a cap on premium price increases . * Coordinated care under consumer control could give women and their families more control of services . But including employers and other purchasers in the definition of " consumer " does not ensure control by users of the services . Certain elements need to be strengthened : * Community health services must be financially supported and mandated components of every plan , and all providers should be required to deliver culturally and linguistically appropriate care for their communities . * Long-term-care services at home , in community care facilities , and , when needed , in institutions must be offered . * All plans should be required to include mid-level providers such as nurse midwives and nurse practitioners as well as certified midwives . * The proposal for standard outcome reporting should include data on rates of cesarean sections , hysterectomies , child immunization , and surgical survival . * Outpatient mental health care , specifically psychotherapy , should not be subject to limits on coverage . Many areas need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system is regressive . As the lowest paid group in the workforce and the most likely to work part-time , women will be disproportionately burdened . * The subsidy cutoff limit of 150 percent of poverty for working women and 250 percent for the unemployed is too low and too abrupt . The provisions for low-income , part-time employees are particularly problematic . If employers are required to pay only a proportion of the " employer share , " these women may be forced to pay more than 20 percent of the premiums out of their meager wages and will need subsidies at income levels higher than 150 percent of poverty . The maximum out-of-pocket costs are also too high . Total costs , including premium , must be capped at a reasonable percent of income . * Current Medicaid recipients would lose access to health services in many states as a result of co-payments and a more restrictive benefits package . * Required co-payments and deductibles impair access to health care . Any flat cost for medical services disproportionately affects women 's already fragile economic status . The inclusion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs and to ensure proper use of medical resources ignores the reality of many women 's lives and the true driving forces behind spiraling costs . Things like unnecessary procedures , inappropriate use and distribution of high technology , and out-of-control capital expenses are what really drive costs up . While co-payment plans discourage visits to providers , they do not distinguish between necessary and unnecessary care . And under the low-cost sharing plan , psychotherapy would remain unaffordable to many . Each visit would cost $25 ; four visits a month could consume a significant portion of a low-income person 's wages . * The timetable for phase-ins is much too long to be of significant use to women who are suffering from lack of access and poor health today . Women are seriously hurt by delays , which only allow time for opponents to undermine much needed changes and to restrict benefits . * Limits on eligibility for long-term care are too strict . * A plan for adequate consumer control over services is missing . And women , as the primary users of the health system , must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . * A role for holistic providers ( for example , acupuncturists and homeopaths ) who provide effective , often low-cost care must be articulated . * Undocumented women and families will lose coverage and have no way to access anything other than emergency care and some preventive services . This will place undocumented people at the risk of exposing their immigration status , and will effectively deny them needed care . * Urban outreach and referral services under the Indian Health Service should not be phased out . Health services to Native Americans are a trust responsibility of the federal government . A separate system should be maintained to guarantee them services .
