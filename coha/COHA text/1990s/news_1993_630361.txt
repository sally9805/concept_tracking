<p> Billy Sunday and Other Poems By Carl Sandburg . <p> Edited and with an introduction by George Hendrick and Willene Hendrick . Harcourt Brace . $ 19.95 ; <p> $ 9.95 paperback . <p> Nearly 80 years after the appearance of his revolutionary Chicago Poems , the poetic legacy of Carl Sandburg has dwindled to a handful of selections recognizable to the average reader , most likely the six imagistic lines of " Fog " and the characterization in " Chicago " of our town as " Hog Butcher for the World/ . . . City of the Big Shoulders . " <p> The fact is that Sandburg produced five major collections  --  including Cornhuskers , his first Pulitzer Prize winner  --  and left behind hundreds of unpublished poems . The bulk of Sandburg 's papers are housed at the University of Illinois , where scholars regularly sift through letters and manuscripts in search of a previously undiscovered gem . ( Another new book based on those manuscripts is More Rootabagas ( Knopf , $ 18 ) , a collection of 10 whimsical children 's stories . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it seems that Sandburg 's poetic reputation is still evolving , or at least reaffirming itself a quarter of a century after the poet 's death . Usually major writers have good reasons for not publishing certain works during their lifetime : either the stuff is n't finished , or it is n't up to snuff . Sorting through a trunk of old manuscripts rarely advances a literary reputation . Consider the sad case of Ernest Hemingway 's posthumous novel . <p> Such is not so with the newest old Sandburg , which represents a careful selection of work that for a variety of reasons , such as editorial timidity or literary politics , never before appeared in book form . Billy Sunday and Other Poems assembles 44 " unpublished or uncollected or unexpurgated " poems  --  nearly half of which are fine ones , and reflect Sandburg 's typically vigorous , iconoclastic pursuit of social justice and a fair chance for ordinary folk . Indeed , Sandburg 's themes and language hold up quite well by contemporary poetic standards , such as they are . <p> The most compelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ editorial queasiness . The title poem , for instance , was recast as " To a Contemporary Bunkshooter " for inclusion in Chicago Poems . Sandburg wrote his publisher in 1916 that his revision of " Billy Sunday " should make it acceptable " to all but the most hidebound and creed-drilled religionists . " But the original has more spark and kick . While the real " Billy Sunday " was Sandburg 's target back then , one can easily imagine application for some of today 's TV evangelists : <p> You come along squirting words at us , shaking your fist and calling us damn fools  --  so fierce the froth of your own spit slobbers over your lips  --  always blabbering we 're all going to hell straight off and you know all about it . <p> I 've read Jesus ' words . I know what he said . You do n't throw any scare into me . I 've got your number . I know how much you know about Jesus . <p> He never came near clean people or dirty people but they felt cleaner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bankers and business men and lawyers that hired the sluggers and murderers who put Jesus out of the running . <p> The passage is fairly representative of Sandburg 's fervor and impressionistic free verse . Sandburg 's fondness for such non-traditional subjects highlights his search for a new cultural consciousness . <p> Another exceptional moment comes in the anti-war poem " Planked Whitefish , " whose reference to genital mutilation made the work unacceptable to publishers at the time : <p> Over an order of planked whitefish at a down town club , <p> Horace Wild , the demon driver who hurled the first aeroplane that ever crossed the air over Chicago . <p> Told Charley Cutler , the famous rassler who never touches booze , <p> And Carl Sandburg , the distinguished poet now out of jail , <p> He saw near Ypres a Canadian soldier fastened on a barn door with bayonets pinning the hands and feet <p> And the arms and ankles arranged like Jesus at Golgotha 2,000 years before <p> Only in northern France he saw <p> The genital organ of a victim amputated and placed between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And Horace Wild , eating whitefish , looked us straight in the eyes . <p> One of the real finds in this new collection is the previously unpublished " The Eastland , " Sandburg 's meditation on the 1915 sinking in the Chicago River of a steamship loaded with 2,500 workers and their families who were being " treated " to a company picnic . <p> Sandburg saw it as a horrific example of corporate manipulation ( the fatal boat trip was actually an advertising stunt intended to end in a photograph of thousands of happy workers ) . Sandburg editorialized the occurrence as " Grim industrial feudalism . . . with dripping and red hands behind the whole Eastland Affair . " <p> Let 's be honest now <p> For a couple of minutes <p> Even though we 're in Chicago . <p> Since you ask me about it , <p> I let you have it straight ; <p> My guts ai n't ticklish about the Eastland . <p> It was a hell of a job , of course <p> To dump 2,500 people in their clean picnic clothes <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Down into the dirty Chicago river without any warning . <p> Here is Sandburg most confortable in his role of poet as witness to harsh urban realities , fashioning a perspective that is street-hardened yet morally conscious . <p> The rest of the poems here are conveniently organized into thematic sections : portraits of those down-and-out , profiles of historical figures , love poems and reportorial sketches . Of interest is a lament for " Sacco and Vanzetti , " several vitriolic views of fellow Illinois poet Edgar Lee Masters , idealistic praise for Socialist Eugene V. Debs , and a brief lyric on the art 's eternal flame : <p> Renoir goes on painting , <p> A man from south France tells me it is so . <p> One picture a day , good or bad , the old man goes on . <p> And a little work every day on one big picture for God and children and remembered women . <p> So Renoir , his right arm no good anymore <p> And the left arm half gone , <p> So Renoir goes on . <p> With these " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deliver quality Sandburg . It 's obvious that most of the work gathered here was composed during the most fruitful period of Sandburg 's poetic career , which was roughly 1915 to 1930 . Certainly these poems exhibit the fierceness and informalism that earmarks the best of Sandburg . And , of course , they also lack verbal precision and psychological complexity  --  again a Sandburg trademark . <p> Yet as an extremist of the spirit , one full of new passions and wonderful compassions , he remains a compelling voice  --  one that is energetic , clear and still capable of informing a contemporary audience . <p> G.

At home , his theme is that the last three decades of unparalleled economic growth were a hallucination . He will replace the hallucination with European social democracy , using as his economic model the U.S. Postal Service or possibly an ant colony . While traveling in Europe his rock star aura was so enravishing that when President Nicolas Sarkozy 's wife , Mme. Carla Bruni , met him at the economic summit in Strasbourg she broke with protocol . The former model and songstress chastely extended her hand to our president rather than accept his kiss , which could have left her sexually aroused , panting uncontrollably and heaving wildly , her hair mussed , mascara running , nostrils flared . She perspires ! She wails ! President Sarkozy is very embarrassed .

" Turning heads indeed- the seven included White House chef Mr. Sam Kass , whose mouth extends from the bottom of his left ear to the bottom of his right ear , and the president 's " personal aide , " Mr. Reggie Love . Like Mr. Kass , Mr. Love is completely bald . Yet back to the Prophet 's world tour . In the Caribbee he exchanged pleasantries with Cuba 's president Raul Castro . Our president also accepted a Spanish version of the famously anti-American tract Open Veins of Latin America from the semi-literate Venezuelan strongman President Hugo Chavez , though it is not clear that our president knew what was in the book . He can not read Spanish and possibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Open Veins . After all , in Europe the Prophet had expressed his belief that the official language of Austria is Austrian . To Mr. Obama Austrian probably looks pretty much like Spanish , or maybe he thought Mr. Chavez was giving him the Venezuelan translation of the book . Our president 's teleprompter was no help , and frankly he appeared a bit out of his depth to everyone save the American press corps , whose members do not know Austrian from Venezuelan either . Back in America , the Prophet detailed his vision of the new American economy during a speech at Georgetown University , where he incongruously invoked the Sermon on the Mount after his aides prevailed on the administrators of the country 's first Catholic university to conceal the religious symbols behind his speaking area . The Prophet asked no more of Catholic Georgetown than he asked of himself . In his speech he never mentioned the author of the Sermon on the Mount , the late Nazarene whose views on several of the Ten Commandments have fallen into disfavor among the Prophet Obama 's supporters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ footballers from Chorlton Villa beat International Manchester 6 to 4 , though one of the winning team 's players was penalized for distracting a penalty kicker by expelling gas . In Switzerland the crime wave continues , with Swiss police utterly flummoxed in their effort to thwart twin brothers who continue to accumulate hundreds of parking tickets with impunity . The brothers , Harold and Michael Lengen , ages 38 and 38 respectively , park their car , a late-model vehicle in which they have joint ownership , in unauthorized parking spots , collect a ticket , and then either Michael , aged 38 , or Harold , aged 38 , appears in court and insists that on the day that the ticket was issued the other brother , aged 38 , was behind the wheel . Swiss authorities are stumped .

" Ha , ha , ha- well , Miss Balding , you have an embarrassing last name ! And let us see your hairpiece , you jackanapes ! In celebrity news , Mr. Phil Spector was convicted of second-degree murder . Mr. Spector is the legendary rock music producer who invented for 1960s rock groups the " Wall of Sound " after spending years listening to the sound of latrines flushing in public comfort stations . He could spend as many as 18 years in prison without his wig . There is no word as to the deposition of his navel lint collection .

Mr. Cain was 63 at the time of his death , 10 years short of the average life expectancy for an American male , but not bad for a Delfonic . Finally , as we go to press there is still no word as to the cause of the death of former porn star and Ivory Snow detergent girl Miss Marilyn Chambers . She was found defunct at her Canyon Country , California , mobile home . Miss Chambers was 56 , precisely 21 years short of the average life expectancy for an American female .

Further , the president declared an arms-control campaign to reduce atomic weaponry globally . Yet even after that show of good faith the administration is faced with global threats . In Nottinghamshire , an English busi- nessman , Mr. Joe Weston-Webb , has set up a 30-foot- long catapult rigged to fire sacks of chicken feces in all directions . Originally Mr. Weston-Webb devised the catapult in the mid-1970s to launch his wife , Mary , across the nearby River Avon . Repeated efforts failed , however , and in fact Mary still lives with him and has devised less arduous ways to cross the river . The catapult is based on an earlier Roman design . So the Obama administration could have difficulty negotiating with Mr. Weston-Webb . Few members of the administration speak Latin , or rather , Roman .
