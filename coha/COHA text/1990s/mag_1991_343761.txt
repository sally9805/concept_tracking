From the first days after Kuwait 's liberation , journalists and human-rights groups have chronicled major violations  --  detentions , beatings , torture , summary executions  --  committed by Kuwaiti armed forces and vigilantes seeking revenge against those suspected of collaborating with the Iraqis . But the Bush Administration , which loudly denounced Iraqi atrocities in occupied Kuwait , has consistently played down charges of abuses by the gulf state the U.S. fought to liberate . Items : <P>  --  On March 8 , State Department deputy spokesman Richard Boucher was asked about Kuwaiti mistreatment of Palestinians . " There are reports of people getting a hard time at checkpoints , " he said . " We do not have information on beatings and killings . " <P>  --  The following day , one week after reopening the U.S. embassy in Kuwait City , Ambassador Edward Gnehm was asked about human-rights abuses . " We have not had nearly the difficulties that people anticipated , " he said . <P>  --  After Amnesty International reported on April 18 that scores of Kuwaiti residents had been arbitrarily arrested , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ' resistance ' groups , " the State Department replied that " the situation by most accounts in Kuwait is very much improved over what existed some weeks ago "  --  thus contradicting its earlier upbeat assessments . State said it was continuing " to discuss with the Kuwaiti authorities all reports of abuses , " but did not say whether it considered any of those reports to be true . <P>  --  Visiting Kuwait on April 22 , Secretary of State James Baker confirmed human-rights violations there  --  indirectly . " The Crown Prince made clear that there were human-rights abuses following the early days of the liberation , " said Baker . He did not publicly condemn those violations on behalf of the U.S. A month later , human-rights workers said they had evidence of continuing abuses , many committed by Kuwaiti officials . <P>  --  After last week 's summary trial of suspected collaborators , State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler consulted Ambassador Gnehm and chose to emphasize the positive . She said the U.S. embassy had urged the Kuwaiti government " to have open trials ; they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a right to counsel ; they did . " But she ignored the fact that lawyers had not met their clients , saw none of the prosecution 's evidence and could not cross-examine witnesses . Under questioning , she acknowledged " glitches " in the trials . Only later did the State Department issue a mild communique saying the U.S. " was concerned by allegations that due process may not have been fully observed . "
