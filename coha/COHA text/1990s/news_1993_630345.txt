<p> When she began writing her book about menopause , said Ann Louise Gittleman , she did n't have a clue how to guide women nutritionally through the ups and downs of midlife . <p> " The whole concept of menopause was frightening . . . I was confronting my own mortality , " said Gittleman , who is 43 . But , she said , like so many women of her generation , " I 'm exploring all the avenues that will keep me feeling better and looking better . " <p> After all , she reasoned , preventive and therapeutic nutritional programs had been developed for heart disease , diabetes , allergies and premenstrual syndrome . There was no reason she could n't design one for menopause . <p> That 's what she 's done in Supernutrition for Menopause ( Pocket Books , $ 5.99 ) , billed as a way to " take control of your life and enjoy new vitality with a diet and exercise program designed just for you . " The book details how a good diet , vitamins , herbs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her advice into practical form with seasonal menus and recipes . <p> Gittleman , a board-certified nutritional specialist and a chairperson of the Department of Nutrition of the American Academy of Nutrition , waded through just about everything that had been written on the topics of menopause and midlife diseases such as diabetes and osteoporosis , then drew conclusions about what may have been missing in the preventive approach . <p> " I 've come to realize that the habits we establish in our 20s , 30s and 40s come back to haunt us in midlife . The time to prepare for menopause is right now . The good news is that it 's never too late to start . " <p> Her book scorns many of the prevailing medical attitudes ( Gittleman believes menopause is a natural change , not a pathological condition ) and treatments ( she takes a harsh view of estrogen-replacement therapy , citing among other factors its potential contribution to breast cancer , which hits one of nine women in this country ) . <p> Gittleman has a long history of going against the grain of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pritikin Longevity Center , which promoted the therapeutic value of very low-fat diets long before they gained widespread acceptance . She went on to establish a private practice in California and consulted for doctors , corporations and clinics that used a combination of diet , exercise and vitamin supplementation in preventive medicine . <p> She wrote Beyond Pritikin in 1988 , Super Nutrition for Women ( which inspired the new book ) and Guess What Came to Dinner ? ( a guide to the parasites that infest us ) . <p> " I 've been interested in every health issue that affects people living in the 1990s , " Gittleman said . Her mission is to uncover the underlying causes of health problems , not just throw treatments at the symptoms . <p> Take estrogen . Because menopausal women 's bodies create very little estrogen , the hormone is prescribed as a treatment for many of the discomforts of menopause ( such as night sweats , vaginal dryness and hot flashes ) . <p> Yet estrogen is a big culprit in breast cancer , Gittleman said . In her book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a commonly favored treatment for menopause symptoms , may be at least partly responsible for the breast cancer that afflicts one in nine women in this country . <p> She also referred to studies showing that women who had had breast cancer had far greater amounts of pesticides and PCBs ( polychlorinated biphenyls , used in manufacturing ) in their breast tissue than did women who had not had cancer . PCBs have estrogenic qualities . <p> Calcium is a key nutrient for women young and old ; as women age , they lose bone , often leading to fractures in old age . Gittleman agrees with researchers who say the solution lies not so much in the calcium we consume as in the calcium we retain . <p> " In our society we tend to overdo dairy products , " said Gittleman , citing research that indicates the calcium-magnesium balance is more important than calcium intake . ( Researchers generally agree that the ratio should be 2:1 in favor of magnesium . ) Because American women do n't eat enough magnesium sources such as green leafy vegetables , whole grains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gittleman said . We also do n't exercise enough ; " use it or lose it " applies to bone as well as muscle . <p> One ignored factor in calcium balance and women 's health in general , she said , is the huge amount of sugar we consume  --  an estimated 120 pounds or more per person per year . " We 've become so fat-conscious we 've overlooked the importance of monitoring our sugar intake , " said Gittleman , who once again is at odds with the establishment . <p> Although nutrition experts routinely advise keeping sugar to a minimum , most cite cavities as the only health problem clearly linked to sugar . Gittleman agrees with researchers who think sugar indirectly robs the body of calcium . <p> " Women are n't going to be keeping enough calcium in their systems if they consume too much sugar "  --  in all its forms : white sugar , honey , fruits and fruit juices , said the nutritionist . Sugar is hidden in many processed foods , from french fries to soup , she noted . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unpopular concept among women , said Gittleman , who has seen more than 7,000 clients during the years of her practice . <p> " Moderation does not mean elimination  --  I can not stress that enough , " she said . " What I 'm seeing is that many women go to enormous extremes " in their diets , whether cutting fat completely or growing obsessed with weight loss . When women lose too much body fat , their bodies ca n't make enough estrogen and they experience menopause prematurely . <p> She subscribes to the belief ( shared by some other researchers ) that super-low-fat diets do women more harm than good . " The reality is that there are certain kinds of oils that have certain protective mechanisms in the body , " Gittleman said . <p> Flaxseed , for example , is being studied for its protective value against breast cancer . It 's also a rich source of omega-3 fats , which some researchers believe are very deficient in the American diet . It also seems to keep in check triglycerides  --  those fatty substances in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in women than in men . <p> " Moderate amounts of the right kinds of oils are not only good for women in terms of protecting their hearts and breasts , but they also are lubricating agents for the hair , skin and nails , " Gittleman said . <p> Oils also are a prime source of vitamin E. " Of all the vitamins and minerals , that is menopausal woman 's very best friend . It has so many important protective and therapeutic values , " she said , adding that it helps alleviate hot flashes and moderate thyroid levels , and works with estrogen to smooth out hormonal ups and downs . If taken long enough , it seems to help alleviate vaginal dryness , a common complaint among many older women . <p> ( Gittleman recommends that women start out with 400 IU of vitamin E daily , then gradually work their way up to 1,200 units . Because the effects of vitamin megadoses over the long term are n't fully known , women should take such a large dose only under a doctor 's supervision . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medications should not take large doses of E. ) <p> Gittleman thinks women need to take responsibility for their health , tailoring a lifestyle to their medical and emotional needs . " Nobody 's going to care as much about your body , your mind , your spirit than you , " she said . She eschews one-size-fits-all diet or medical programs , and her book gives women choices from among foods , vitamins , herbs , homeopathic remedies and exercises . <p> " Nutrition information is coming down the pike , and how it 's translated is not working , " said Gittleman . " I wo n't look at literature and promote what seems to be in vogue when it does n't work in real life . I have had clients that thrived on the Pritikin diet ( a spartan regimen that is extremely low in fat and high in carbohydrates ) . I have also seen people that did better with less carbohydrate and more protein in their diets . " She and her partner are working on a book about personalizing diets . The differences may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typing and metabolism . <p> Gittleman knocks modern medicine 's pharmaceutical approach to menopause  --  dispensing estrogen , tranquilizers and the like  --  yet it could be argued that she takes a similar approach with vitamins E and C , magnesium and dong quai ( a Chinese herb used for centuries to keep female hormones in balance ) . <p> " True . But this is a more natural approach , without the side effects , " said Gittleman , who thinks there 's a place for both kinds of pharmaceuticals . " I 'm just giving people a choice . " <p> She emphasized that she 's not necessarily preaching do-it-yourself medicine . She definitely does not recommend that women on estrogen therapy ditch it suddenly in favor of vitamin E. Instead , women should discuss the ideas in her book with their doctors and try to come up with a program that suits them . Even more ideal is to work with a nutritionally oriented physician , nurse or nutritionist who has a good track record using natural remedies , she said . <p> Gittleman no longer fears her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ topic has given me a new perspective , " she said . " I think it 's a very exciting time . It represents a new dawn for many women . " Seasoned by life and often finished raising their children , she said , they can take a spiritual inventory and spend some time on themselves . @x Using Supports Made of Synthetic Materials I would like to know why artists do n't use synthetic materials such as nylon , rayon , or plastics instead of linen or cotton . Known to have long life spans , synthetics are also ( supposedly ) impervious to the effects of oil and acrylic , with or without sizing . From an archival point of view , synthetic materials are not considered permanent painting supports because they have not been around long enough to have withstood the test of time . And although it is true that synthetic resin paint media , such as acrylic , might also be said not to have passed the archival test , it actually is possible to perform simulated time tests on paint that can not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requirements for artist 's canvas is that it must have reliable adhesive qualities for the ground and for the paint media on the ground . Until recently , most synthetics did not possess these qualities . Today , however , some synthetic yarns are made by spinning the fibers in a manner similar to that of naturalyarn fibers . These synthetics are quite good , but their reputation needs time to grow in the public 's perception . Avoid nylon , Dacron , and polypropylene fabrics , which do not possess the adhesive characteristics required for a flexible support . Repairing a Dent in Your Canvas While moving a canvas , I pushed something into the back , leaving a dent in the front of the painting . Is there any way I can repair this ? There are a few different approaches to removing a dent from a stretched canvas and restoring its tautness : First try rubbing a wet finger over the back of the canvas in the indented area . Allow a few hours for the canvas to dry naturally . If the result is not satisfactory , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important not to let the canvas become thoroughly wet . Another method that is recommended but requires restraint is to apply a fine spray of water to the damaged area , again without soaking the canvas . The tiniest amount of alcohol added to the water will quicken the drying process by causing evaporation . Do not use a hair dryer or other artificial means to speed up the drying time because it is important to allow the canvas to dry naturally and thoroughly . Sometimes , as a last resort , a canvas that has been dented may require restretching . Displaying Pastel Paintings Without Glass I work in pastel and would like to fix the surface so that it can be displayed without glass . I have seen this kind of work in galleries but have been unable to find out how it was done . Galleries may display pastels on paper unframed and without glass , but this is usually only for the duration of an exhibition rather than for a permanent installation . Furthermore , galleries and museums maintain quality control over temperature , humidity , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materials over time in a more normal home environment . It is almost always recommended to frame pastel under glass , not only because paper is a fragile support but also because pastel is one of the most fragile materials . What makes pastel a unique medium is the way delicate coloring effects are achieved by building up layers . Fixative can be used to help make the pastel dust adhere to the support ; but if not used sparingly , fixative can dissolve the tonal values and other delicate coloring effects . When saturated with fixative , the pastel layers collapse into a single flat layer , which causes color changes and the loss of opacity . The overall effect of too much fixative is to make pastel resemble ordinary paint film . Some artists apply a coat of spray varnish over pastel to make it more permanent , but this also changes the nature of the pastel . The Best Way to Reproduce Designs for Art Cards I have been making watercolor note cards and greeting cards to use as gifts and to sell at art events . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artistic way to duplicate my designs ? In the past I just repainted the designs or had color photocopies made of the watercolor designs at a local printing store . Would using a computer scanner be better or more practical ? It is more practical to reproduce designs for art cards with a highquality photocopier than to reproduce them by hand . With your own scanner and printer you can surely make the process more cost efficient . To add quality and permanence to the cards , you may wish to use some of the fine-art add-free papers and colorfast inks that are available today . Although handpainted card designs have more value than reproductions , the labor involved in hand painting is not necessarily recognized in the marketplace unless you have a specialty outlet where clients are willing to pay a bit more for one-of-a-kind cards . Copying designs by hand is altogether different and does not warrant the time and energy it takes to produce them . Have a technical question for one of our experts ?
