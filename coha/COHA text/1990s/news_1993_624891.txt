<p> MIAMI - If a true-to-life television show were made about Dave Barry , much of it would consist of Barry , a humor writer , sprawled in front of his computer screen , procrastinating . <p> Sometimes he would get up and play his electric guitar , a Fender Stratocaster . About four times a day , he might feel unfunny and distract himself with a peanut butter sandwich ( no jelly ) . And sometimes he would admire one of the inexplicable items strewn about his office , such as a plastic replica of " " The Last Supper " with a clock stuck in the corner . <p> " " A lot of people look at " " The Last Supper " which is by Leonardo da Vinci , and they say , ' What 's missing there is a clock , ' " Barry said during an interview in his office , which is next to the laundry room in his airy new house in the heart of suburban South Miami . " " I 'm sure that if he had only lived - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have definitely put a clock in . " <p> Oddly enough , at least in his opinion , Barry will indeed be the subject of a new situation comedy on CBS this fall . Called " " Dave 's World , " it is about a humor columnist for a Miami newspaper much like Barry 's real employer , the Miami Herald , who is struggling to grow up in the face of such responsibilities as a wife , children and a job . It 's low on scenes of Barry sitting around his office . <p> The show is just the latest step in Barry 's metamorphosis from a regular suburban guy writing a weekly column into a full-scale humor conglomerate . In addition to writing his syndicated column , which can be read in the Chronicle 's Texas Magazine on Sundays , Barry contributes features to the Herald , has written more than half a dozen books that have sold more than a million copies and , most recently , has been playing rock ' n ' roll with a ragtag band of mostly famous writers called the Rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barry Does Japan " ( Random House , $ 18 ) , " " Dave Barry 's Only Travel Guide You 'll Ever Need " ( Fawcett , $ 17.50 ) and " " Dave Barry Slept Here " ( Random House , $ 15.95 ) , a history book that includes the fact that Abraham Lincoln 's home was a log cabin " " that consisted entirely of one single log . " Some books do better than others : " " Dave Barry Turns 40 " ( Fawcett , $ 10 paperback ) spent 24 weeks on the New York Times best-seller list . <p> Reserving judgment <p> Barry , who won the Pulitzer Prize for commentary in 1988 and who answered the door in a **29;414;TOOLONG outfit of really faded jeans and a really faded shirt , said that he has seen the " " Dave 's World " pilot , in which he is played by Harry Anderson . He is reserving judgment . " " <p> Some of the specific jokes they use are basically things I 'd written in my columns , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've never written a plot , they have to provide one . " ( They also took away one of his two dogs and added a second child , which might actually prove helpful for tax purposes , Barry said . ) <p> He rejected the chance to write for the show . His only connection is that it is based on his books . " " I thought that sounded like a great idea , in the sense that I would have to do nothing , " he said . " " ' You will mail me a check and I will do nothing , ' I thought , and that had great appeal to me as a business concept . " <p> Being the subject of a situation comedy is a far cry from working as an effective-writing instructor , which Barry once did . He also worked as a reporter in West Chester , Pa. , assigned to cover " " every aspect of sewage . " He was beginning to reminisce about his sewage days when his wife , Beth , came in with a tray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Sunday magazine , Tropic , and in the Barry house she serves as something of an editor , too . It was unusual for her to be transporting baked goods , and when Barry unwisely asked if she planned to can some preserves next , she pointedly reminded him of an impending appointment and left . <p> Barry makes his living by taking prosaic ideas to incongruous extremes . It is hard to place him in the spectrum of American humor writers . He is more versatile than Erma Bombeck , sweeter than P.J. O'Rourke and sillier than just about everyone . <p> His mock transcript of the 1991 Clarence Thomas confirmation hearings , for instance , starred Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts hiding his face under a paper bag and the oatmeal-voiced Sen. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina saying , through a translator , " " Someone has colored my hair with what appears to be Tang breakfast drink . " <p> In Barry 's universe , every New York taxi driver has a posted sign saying , " " Driver hates you " ; South Dakota is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become a member of the state legislature " ; and English spelling is unusual because " " our language is a rich verbal tapestry woven together from the tongues of the Greeks , the Latins , the Angles , the Klaxtons , the Celtics , and many other ancient peoples , all of whom had severe drinking problems . " <p> Humor from the ordinary <p> Barry said he does n't think his life is aggressively funny . <p> Instead , humor is born of the ordinary . " " I think humor comes from noticing that the world is already strange and weird and scary , and laughter is a mechanism for dealing with it , " he said , padding over to his refrigerator and offering little bottles of Perrier . <p> Barry said that he is " " a good 5 feet 9 inches , 5 feet 10 inches , or , as we say when we 're that tall , 6 feet . " He looks startlingly young , with a sweetly goofy demeanor and straight hair worn long in the back , a la David Cassidy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little wave . <p> " " The heyday of hair for me was the Beatle era , " he said . " " It always looks like this . I go to this woman who 's really good and very professional , and she works and works at it and sprays and mousses it , and it looks great . It looks like a grown-up had it . But then , " " doooiiinng " - he demonstrates - " " minutes later I see myself in a shopping-center window , and it 's back . " <p> The price ? " " Twenty dollars , not including the cost of clearing the airport . Ha , ha . Oh , this political humor . " <p> ' Aesthetically impaired ' <p> His house is vast and white and cool . There was a ceiling fan going overhead and a housekeeper vacuuming . Two things were particularly noticeable : First , unpacked boxes were strewn everywhere , holdovers from several months ago when the Barrys and their son , Robby , 12 , moved from their old house , which Hurricane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world o ' crud . " <p> And second , the walls were bare . After trying to pretend that he had unpacked while the rest of his family had not , Barry said , " " Both Beth and I are terminally aesthetically impaired people . We never have anything on our walls . If we 're really lucky , we 'll move into a house where there 's still rectangles of dirt from where the other people had stuff on their walls , so we know where it should go . " <p> In raced two familiar characters from Barry 's columns : Earnest , his large main dog , with long black hair and a deadly wagging tail , and Zippy , the smaller , backup dog , who has a sand-colored coat and might well be a little slower mentally than Earnest . Earnest , who was named for her sincerity , likes to lie under Barry 's desk and bark , while Zippy just waits for people to drop things for him to eat . <p> " " The dog on the television show is clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and jumped on a bed , " Barry said , leaning out his office window . Robby , in a wheelchair because of a broken leg , was being caromed around the yard by some stringy teen-aged friends . " " If you break any of his other bones , " his father called , " " I will personally have to kill you . " <p> A band of celebrities <p> One place Barry has had ample opportunity to indulge in childish group humor lately is with the other members of his year-old band , which includes Amy Tan , Roy Blount Jr. , Barbara Kingsolver , Robert Fulghum and Stephen King . The group recently embarked on a bus tour from Massachusetts to Miami , playing to crowds waving copies of their books . <p> " " Stephen King was the motivating force , because it turns out that pretty much whatever he wants to do , he can do , " Barry said . " " Like if he said to his publisher , ' I 'd like to start a new state and I 'd like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it . <p> " " But he works very hard to be normal . We would get off at a truck stop at 3 o'clock in the morning somewhere , anywhere , and within about a minute somebody would show up with a copy of one of his books . There are some really weird people who like Stephen . They 'll be standing in a crowd and yelling " - he puts his arms in front of him like a zombie and speaks without inflection - " " Stephen ! Stephen ! " <p> Not that Barry does n't have his own obsessive readers . His columns can generate hundreds of letters , such as the time he insulted Neil Diamond and heard from " " a certain percentage of the reading public who loves Neil Diamond and yet can still operate a typewriter . " And longtime fans still remember the handful of serious columns , including Barry 's heartbreaking account of his mother 's suicide several years ago . <p> Barry loves Miami , having remained there despite numerous offers of jobs in Los Angeles , Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving it the gentle hard time he gives everything else . Walking into his driveway , he tried to explain the way to the airport , drawing a nice diagram that , if followed , might land you in the south Miami woods . " " This is Miami , and there may not be signs , " he said . " " There may be guys with guns . " <p> He described a German tourist who met up with some car hijackers . " " They did n't shoot her , " he said . " " Let 's be fair . <p> They ran her over . " Then he cheerily waved goodbye and said , " " Whatever you do , do n't get out of your car . "
