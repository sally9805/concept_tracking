<p> Pat Mitchell sits amid a swirl of argument , paper balls and bad jokes . Not a strand of her sleekly-styled hair is out of place . <p> She 's leading a weekly staff meeting , but some of her young staffers are attempting to lead her astray . <p> With a straight face , one of them hands Mitchell a lewd , 3-D postcard of a woman biker . He suggests it as a logo for an upcoming show called " Rebel Woman . " <p> Mitchell takes a long look and laughs . She has seen better - and worse - during a 20-year ascent into the upper ranks of TV programming . <p> That climb has landed her at the head of Turner Original Productions , the new division that produces original nonfiction programming at Atlanta-based Turner Broadcasting System Inc . Her work will appear on cable TV channels TBS Superstation , TNT and Turner Classic Movies . In addition to various nonfiction series , Turner Original will produce six new documentaries this year . <p> Mitchell 's position makes her one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For her , that 's no big deal . Friends say she has built a career out of being where she was n't necessarily supposed to be . <p> " Pat is somebody who does not accept somebody 's else sense of limits , " says ABC commentator Jeff Greenfield , who has known Mitchell for 25 years . <p> In that time , Mitchell has been an anchor at the " Today Show , " a network news reporter , a TV producer and talk show host . <p> " Pat 's done everything from Sunday morning art pieces to covering war zones , " says Coby Atlas , a TV producer who first met her at NBC . " She can produce , write , edit and lug a camera . " <p> Began as professor <p> Mitchell has often swum upstream . After starting out as a English professor at the University of Georgia , she soon left for a magazine writing job in New York . <p> In the New York of the 1960s , Mitchell was a curiosity . " People were always stopping on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Most of them had never seen a Southern belle . " <p> Mitchell may have been Southern but she was not of the belle mode . She was a divorcee who worked and raised a child alone in the 1960s - a time when the nuclear family ruled supreme . <p> Nor were many TV journalists former college professors . In television , Mitchell was a red head in a male-dominated business that preferred blondes . <p> " As a woman on the air , your hair is made blonder and blonder , " says Mitchell , who is no longer a TV blonde . <p> She remains hard to categorize today . She 's a native Georgian without a drawl . Her parody of a British accent , though , is bloody good . <p> Always well-dressed , the lively Mitchell commands attention when she enters a room . <p> " Pat 's outgoing and attractive , but that 's not all she is , " says Greenfield . " There 's a keen mind at work . " <p> Indeed , Mitchell 's a TV journalist who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literature . And , most important to her new job , she 's a serious journalist who wants documentaries to be good fun . <p> " Where is it written that documentaries have to be boring to be good ? " Mitchell said . <p> Mitchell came to Turner Broadcasting as an independent documentary maker based in Los Angeles in 1992 . Since then , she 's produced 50 hours of nonfiction programming that goes well beyond TBS ' standard fare of Jacques Cousteau specials . <p> Her work at TBS includes specials about motorcycles and pets . She has profiled outrageous Americans such as Robert Ripley , creator of " Ripley 's Believe It or Not . " <p> Mitchell is expanding her agenda to include young viewers . Under her direction , Turner Broadcasting is producing a show on pirates . She 's recruited former Who singer Roger Daltry as the host . <p> In addition , Mitchell launched a weekly late-night music show called " Live From the House of Blues . " <p> " House of Blues " has n't caught on , but much of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American Motorcycle , " was TBS ' biggest hit . It garnered a 3.7 A.C. Nielsen rating , which means some 2.3 million households tuned in . <p> While small compared to a network TV hit , it 's a good showing for cable programming . <p> Mitchell 's work at Turner Broadcasting has also garnered professional accolades . " A Century of Women , " which she struggled for 10 years to make , has won five awards in the past two years . <p> Mitchell talks with Chairman Ted Turner at least once a week . He has even asked her to sit in for him on the international environmental committee called Green Cross , one of his many social commitments . That meant traveling recently to Russia for a meeting . <p> Inauspicious beginning <p> Mitchell 's career in television did n't begin so auspiciously . In fact , she never intended to enter television . <p> She came to New York in the 1960s as a young writer for Look magazine . But the magazine folded before it had published her first big piece , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's offices for the last time , Mitchell was interviewed by a local TV reporter . She wanted to know what Mitchell would do next . <p> " I think I 'll go into television , " was Mitchell 's flippant response . <p> Her quote ended up on the nightly news and within weeks she had her chance . WNBC-TV hired Mitchell to re-create her Chinese gang story . <p> The station loved the story but hated Mitchell 's TV persona . <p> Its editor tried to farm her out to sister stations around the country . <p> " No one would hire me , " Mitchell recalls with a chuckle . <p> A single mom and broke , she was about to retreat South back into academia . Then she landed a job producing commercials for the short-lived presidential campaign of New York Mayor John Lindsey . <p> That work led to Mitchell 's first television job , covering the arts for NBC affiliate WBZ in Boston . From there , Mitchell 's television career blossomed . <p> " Pat has natural presence on camera , " says Atlas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She has an ease with chaos that ca n't be taught . " <p> That sense of presence has served Mitchell well at Turner Broadcasting . It 's a free-wheeling , cost-conscious organization dominated by young turks . <p> Mitchell 's office is unmarked in the basement of the old mansion that is the headquarters of the Turner Entertainment Group . <p> From there , she commands a staff of 40 scattered from Los Angeles to New York . <p> At that recent weekly development meeting , a fierce fight broke out around Mitchell over a proposed show . It was men against women . Insults and paper balls flew . <p> Mitchell let the fight sputter out . Then , blazing in a red jacket , she turned to the two male instigators . <p> " The two of you may sit in the corner . " She smiled sweetly , but the two immediately knew it was time to knock it off .
