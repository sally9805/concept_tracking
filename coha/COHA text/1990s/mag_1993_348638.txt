PERFORMER : STING <P> ALBUM : 10 SUMMONER 'S TALES <P> LABEL : A &M; RECORDS <P> THE BOTTOM LINE : The former Police-man rewrites the book of love with an album of puckish passion plays . <P> Under the polished surface of his pop-star persona , Sting is a hopeless romantic , obsessed with the gritty , contradictory textures of human emotion . During the early 1980s , as the lead singer and lyricist for the Police , the brooding bassist used his poetic gifts to dredge up the debris of his own psyche  --  and sell millions of records . After going solo in 1985 , he injected jazz and politics into the polyrhythmic mix , but his worldly concerns never strayed far from the ardent diplomacy of love . <P> Sting continues his meditation on the tangled ways of the heart with 10 Summoner 's Tales , actually a collection of 11 songs ( if you count the Epilogue ) that offer few surprises but many familiar pleasures . True to the album 's title , which alludes to Chaucer 's The Canterbury Tales , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the book of love . The artful introspection of his previous record , 1991 's The Soul Cages , has been replaced by a puckish objectivity ; each song is a self-contained vignette , distilling a moment or sometimes an entire life , traversing the emotional spectrum from unfettered joy to the abyss of abject despair . Sting 's sonic palette has grown impressively eclectic : he illustrates each tale with a sure-handed array of dramatic colors  --  a stroke of Spanish guitar here , a daub of blue trumpet there . <P> From the wistful ballad Fields of Gold to the insouciant rocker She 's Too Good for Me , the lyrics wring pathos and irony from the misfortunes of unlucky lovers . Yet Sting 's manners are too refined to let the suffering spoil the lush settings ; the shackles in this emotional dungeon are lined with velvet . In Seven Days , pizzicato strings thrum a decorous , mocking waltz as a man muses over various ways to deal with a romantic rival . In the darkly cynical Love Is Stronger than Justice , a man kills his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I look forward to a better day , " Sting blithely sings . " But ethical stuff never got in my way/ And though there used to be brothers seven/ The other six are singing in heaven . " <P> Despite the havoc that Sting 's protagonists cause in their quest for connection , they remain doggedly  --  and sometimes miserably  --  driven by their desire . In It 's Probably Me , the narrator clings to a one-sided relationship in a world that 's " gone crazy and makes no sense . . . If there 's one guy who 'd lay down his life for you and die/ It 's hard to say it/ I hate to say it , but it 's probably me . " In an age that has slipped its moral tracks , Sting seems to say , love is the only thing worth fighting for . <P> The album closes with Epilogue ( Nothing ' bout Me ) , a swinging , carefree ditty in which the singer takes a parting shot at his would-be analysts . Like a puppeteer peeking out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Pick my brain , pick my pockets/ Steal my eyeballs and come back for the sockets/ Run every kind of test from A to Z/ And you 'll still know nothing ' bout me . " It 's a fittingly elusive coda from pop 's most mercurial bard .
