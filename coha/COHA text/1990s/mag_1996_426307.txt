A teacher 's cool head and secret tape may have caught her killer // THE BOUQUETS SCATTERED ON THE lawn outside Thorne Middle School are frozen , covered in a wet spring snow . Inside , students stand , observing a moment of silence . Each morning for two months , since special education teacher Kathleen Stanfield Weinstein began her Random Acts of Kindness program , they had listened as she read aloud over the intercom one student 's account of goodwill , chosen from among the many tacked to a bulletin board in the lobby . But on this March day , no cheerful message greets the Middletown , NJ. , students . And on the bulletin board more than a hundred paper hearts commemorate not their good deedsbut hers . " You were n't just a teacher but a best friend too , " reads the note on one . Outside the low brick building , a lit sign bids a final farewell : " Mrs. Weinstein , thanks for your random acts of kindness . We will remember you . " They will also remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acts of kindness can not confer protection against one random act of violence-like the one that occurred at dusk on March 14 , when , police say , a 16-year-old carjacker decided he wanted Weinstein 's Toyota Camry enough to kill her . Yet even in death the 45-year-old teacher is proving an inspiration to those she left behind . In a display of courage and composure that left Ocean and Monmouth County police astonished , Weinstein managed to turn on a microcassette recorder she had in her bag , take out the tape after 24 minutes , flip it over and put it back in , take it out 22 minutes later and slip it into her pocket-all without the knowledge of her captor , seated inches away . Moreover , Weinstein talked her assailant into divulging his first name , his mother 's military record and his high school .

" she asks the carjacker early on , her voice brimming with teacherly concern . " You 're determining your whole life and the direction you 're taking .... Why do n't you just start all over and not take the car and let me drive you somewhere ? You 'll be safe , and you do n't have to get in trouble . " Photograph LaSane got his driver 's license the day after he acquired Weinstein 's car ( below ) . // Tragically her words went unheeded , and on March 19 , in Berkeley Township , NJ. , 20 miles from Weinstein 's home in Tinton Falls , high school sophomore Michael LaSane was charged with murder and carjacking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ocean County probation department , and some of LaSane 's friends are incredulous . LaSane himself has denied any wrongdoing . He claims he bought Weinstein 's car , which he parked outside his home at the Magnolia Gardens apartment complex , from an acquaintance for $800 , with a promise to pay another $4,200 . LaSane denies that the voice on the tape is his . " Michael steadfastly maintains his innocence , " said his lawyer , Kevin E. Daniels , " and expects to be vindicated when this matter is resolved in the appropriate forum , a court of law . " To Weinstein 's family-her husband , parents and 10 brothers and sisterswho gathered in Ocean County prosecutor Dan Carluccio 's office to hear the tape , the denial rings hollow . According to police , the man on the tape , who they believe is LaSane , coolly expressed concern about whether the car 's oil had been changed or if the Camry was leased or bought and paid for . " He said he did n't intend on making payments , " says Ocean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't want anyone coming after him . " The casual cruelty of her killer has left Weinstein 's family unable , for the moment , to respond . " They 're overcome by emotion , " says their friend and attorney Carmine Villani . " You do n't realize what cold-blooded murder means until you 've heard the tape . The only thing in the way of getting the car was Kathleen . " Although she stood only 5 ' ' 3 " and weighed 128 lbs. , Weinstein was a formidable figure . A teacher in the Middletown school system since the late ' ' 80s , Weinstein had been at Thorne since 1990 . There , she worked with students with learning disabilities . " She could turn around tough students , " says friend and school speech pathologist Letitia Pallone . When she sensed trouble , she took it upon herself to contact parents . Says Pallone : " She did n't wait for progress reports . " Weinstein did n't wait for anything . On weekends , she relaxed in the Colonial-style home she and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a janitorial equipment , chemicals and supplies company , had lived in for seven years , and where she had gardened and played on the swing set out back with her 6-year-old son , Daniel . But come Monday , says Thorne custodian Paul Avila , " she was always go , go , go . " As for LaSane-a sophomore at Toms River High School Southclassmates describe him as an average student who liked basketball and was n't into drugs . " He got into minor scrapes , cutting classes , discipline problems-nothing major , " says superintendent of schools Michael Ritacco . Last year , LaSane had a run-in with police when he was stopped for disorderly conduct , resisting arrest and assault ; and recently , reportedly , he was involved in an altercation with an Ocean County sheriff 's officer and was sentenced to probation for the incident . But his friends know him as good-natured , if somewhat withdrawn . " He was quiet , " said 17-year-old Jamar Johnson . " He stuck by himself . " On March 14 , the day before his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Center . Though he had no job , police say , LaSane had decided to give himself a Camry-just like the one he saw parked in the strip mall shortly before 3 p.m . Weinstein had taken the day off from school to study for a graduate school administration exam she had to take that evening . At about 2:30 she left her house , and before heading for a 3:30 appointment at the office of her brother , a chiropractor , she stopped at the mall , bought a sandwich at Palumbo 's restaurant and took it back to her car . It was then that she was grabbed from behind and forced into the gold Camry . They drove to secluded Manitou Park , three miles to the south .

Secretly she turned it on and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll make you a promise that I wo n't tell anybody , " she assured him . " Because you wo n't be taking my car and you wo n't be hurting me and maybe you can get away . " Instead , police say , they stopped the car in the woods , and LaSane made her unload her belongings . All the while , she kept talking to him , asking him about himself , his life , his hopes . " Do n't you think they are going to find you ? " Weinstein asked . " You ca n't have a life of crime like this , " she said . " You 'll wind up spending your life in prison if you do n't get killed . " By the time she managed to flip the cassette over , she knew she was losing ground . She broke down in tears as she asked for the chance to see her son again , as she shared her desire to adopt another child . " I want to give something to somebody , " she said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It was no use . According to police , LaSane bound her ankles and wrists with duct tape and waited for dark . He allegedly suffocated her with her coat , then tossed it over her lifeless body . When a dog walker discovered her three days later , her belongings were carefully stacked nearby : gym clothes , books and , in her bag , the recorder . " Her family did n't realize how courageous she was until they heard the tape , " says attorney Villani . In some way , according to him and prosecutor Doran , the record of her final moments has brought her family comfort . " Hearing her voice within an hour of her death was mysterious , even religious , " says Doran . " It was therapeutic for them to know she was that strong right up until her death .

If the prosecutor has his way , he will be tried as an adult for criminal homicide and carjacking-and spend from 30 to 60 years behind bars . To some who knew Weinstein , even that seems too small a penalty . But as her friend Pallone sees it , Weinstein would not want the people she loved to be consumed by sorrow  --  or anger at her killer . " We 'll always remember how she died , " Pallone says softly . " But Kathy would want us to forgive him . " <p>
