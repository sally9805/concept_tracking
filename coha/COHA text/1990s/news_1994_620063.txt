<p> A turntable recently sat unnoticed with the coffee percolators and other obsolete appliances at a Cow Hollow garage sale until a curious teenager asked what that square contraption was . <p> In the retro-logic of rock and roll , this makes the record player and records outmoded enough to appeal to the cognoscenti , who are mounting a resistance movement against the tinny little compact disc in its ticky-tacky plastic box . <p> Resisting industry propaganda that CDs are an advancement , record lovers are determined to buy records , real 12- inch , black-grooved vinyl , in arty cardboard covers . These are n't just iconoclasts rummaging through the used-record bins , but grungers , punks and hip-hoppers dedicated to sonic purity . <p> Bands are insisting that their new releases be made available in the big , waxy format , and the major labels , which declared vinyl all but dead a few years ago , are now exhuming it , if reluctantly , in limited pressings of 5,000 or so records for preferred artists . <p> Pearl Jam , Green Day , Beastie Boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bad Religion , Guided by Voices , Public Enemy , Arrested Development and Pink Floyd all have included vinyl in their recent releases . <p> " There are young people who are militant about it , " says J.C . Hopkins , a San Francisco singer who was filling in at the Record Finder on upper Market Street . " It 's becoming almost a minor little rebellion for people . " <p> The battle will be met today when Reprise , a division of Warner Bros. , releases American Music Club 's " San Francisco " on vinyl  --  two weeks before it becomes available on compact disc or cassette . <p> " I ca n't wait to hear what it sounds like , " says Mark Eitzel , the leader of AMC , whose previous two releases were unavailable on domestic vinyl . Like many , Eitzel left his bulky spinner behind a few moves ago . But he 'll find one to play his own voice on , maybe at a Cow Hollow garage sale . <p> For the masses who have misguidedly dumped their turntables , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marvin Etzioni 's " Weapons of the Spirit " CD begins with the sound of a stylus arm meeting vinyl , as does the rap band Gravediggaz ' " 6 Feet Deep . " Tom Waits ' " The Black Rider " comes with built-in surface noise . The first cut of " Crash Test Dummies " carries crackles and pops to imitate vinyl personality . <p> Bands with more clout are insisting on records . A year ago Epic released Pearl Jam 's " Vs " on vinyl a week in advance of CD and cassette . The pressing of 41,000 records ultimately sold out . <p> Last winter , Warner Bros. did a vinyl prerelease of Green Day 's " Dookie . " The East Bay punks were told they would n't make any royalties from the vinyl . But " it did n't matter , " says bassist Mike Dirnt , 22 , who is becoming accustomed to sacrifice , having given up three teeth in a mudslinging melee at Woodstock ' 94 . <p> " Dookie " has sold 1.85 million units in all formats , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " When you get a gold record now , it 's ' Did you really earn a gold record ? ' " he asks rhetorically , " ' or did you earn a gold CD ? ' " <p> This sociological query may not carry much weight with the labels , but if the vinyl sneak preview builds a buzz , they 're all for it . <p> " Real music junkies buy vinyl , and they have big mouths and will start talking about it , " says Bill Bentley , publicist for Warner Bros . <p> Today , the Pet Shop Boys will join the mix with " Disco 2 " on all three formats . Also today , Capitol will reissue the Beach Boys ' first 17 albums on vinyl only . A week from today , R.E.M . ' s " Monsters " will be released in all three formats , along with Big Head Todd and the Monsters ' " Strategem . " Next month , Tom Petty 's " Wildflowers " will also be released on all three formats  --  though it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> This is also the case with Neil Young 's " Sleeps With Angels , " which at 74 minutes barely fits onto one CD , and requires two records , at a suggested price of $ 19.99 . <p> The average CD runs about an hour , but anything longer than 40 minutes on LP risks lessened sound quality . AMC 's " San Francisco " is 66 minutes on CD and 48 on vinyl . To fit it , five of the 16 songs had to be removed , but a song was added that is not on the CD . <p> PHASING OUT VINYL <p> Except for a few powerful purists such as Bruce Springsteen , who has insisted on vinyl all along , the major labels have phased it out . Even Young , who has called CDs " probably the biggest catastrophe that has happened to the recording of music in the last 10 years or so , " found his " Harvest Moon , " a folksy 1992 piece meant for vinyl , unavailable on that format . <p> Vinyl is still the medium of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the large disc found its way back as a German import doing brisk trade at $ 17.98 at Mod Lang in Berkeley . <p> For Young 's " Sleeps With Angels , " released last month , Reprise shipped 400,000 CDs , 136,000 cassettes and 6,200 LPs . More will be pressed if there is a demand , but the labels do n't allow return of unsold stock , and the major retailers such as Tower Records are cautious with their orders . <p> Manager Jim Portnick of the Tower store near Fisherman 's Wharf will have 15 copies of R.E.M . ' s " Monster " next Tuesday , and they might sell out that day , at $ 10.44 , as against $ 12.99 for the CD . <p> The independent stores , where vinyl fans tend to shop , order more freely . The Record Finder sold 75 copies of Sonic Youth 's latest , and Bob Dylan 's " Good as I Been to You " also moved . <p> Even the Wherehouse , most plasticized of all chains , has a vinyl display in its store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curmudgeons bemoaning that just 15 years ago any record could be bought new for $ 3.66 on sale . It 's the young , without a history with vinyl , who are fueling the rebellion . <p> " The whole idea of CDs is people being told they have to pay more for the same thing , " says Larry Winther , 27 , guitarist for the Mummies , a Peninsula garage/ thrash band that has issued 18 vinyl recordings and put out an album called " F - - - CDs , It 's the Mummies . " <p> " Something about vinyl is just awesome , " says Dirnt . " Maybe it 's the ambient noise in the background , and maybe it 's that that 's where it started . " <p> WHICH SOUNDS BETTER ? <p> The claim is that CDs sound better , but many serious listeners are quite sure the opposite is true . <p> " With vinyl , you get the texturing of guitars , and it sounds more human and less like it was mixed by scientists in a laboratory , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Berkeley 's Amoeba Records displays vinyl " right on the front rack , because it 's not dead , " says buyer Jefferson Parker , 26 . <p> At the store , Young 's " Sleeps With Angels " is usually played on CD for convenience . But at home Parker cranks it up on vinyl and insists that the improvement is noticeable . <p> " CDs sound a little thinner , " says Parker . <p> Eitzel of AMC is more specific . " In terms of rock music and vocal music , vinyl squishes the high end and low end together and makes it jump out more . " <p> Disc jockeys do n't like the shiny discs because they ca n't tell by the spacing of the grooves how much time is left before it 's time to cue the next song . Records may get scratchy , but unless they are warped , they will last indefinitely . No one knows for sure the life span of the CD , though Biafra has an idea . <p> " Unless it 's made in Japan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a decade of manufacturing , " he predicts . " But by then they 'll try to rip us off with another format . "
