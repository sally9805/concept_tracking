MAPLE SUGAR SEASON ( SPRING ) . THE WOMAN PUTS A WOOD PEG IN THE TREE AND TIES HER BIRCHBARK BASKET BELOW IT . LATER , SHE TAKES THE BUCKET , TIES IT OVER THE FIRE . STIRS UNTIL THE SYRUP BECOMES SUGAR . THE CRADLE BOARD IS ALWAYS NEAR HER . INDIAN WOMAN ( SINGS TO HER BABY AS AN INDIAN APPEARS FROM OFFSTAGE . ) Mey mey mey mey . HALFBREED MAN The Great Spirit wanted to fly . So He asked a bird to tell Him how . Just where to put the feathers on . Just how to move the arms . Flap . Flap . It was n't easy . Now faster You . Hey Great Spirit . Said the bird . Flap faster . And the Great Spirit flapped faster and finally got It off the ground . Now hey when You are above . The Indian people will call You . The bird said . Now do n't look down . Hey . Do n't look anywhere but to the sky before You . Now the Great Spirit practiced flying and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking . Just snorting and flapping feathers and getting out of breath flapping . Yeah . Until He got It going . Yeah . He got It off the ground . The beavers clapped their hands . Yo . The otter . Yeah . The muskrats . Ho . All of creation got to clapping . The Great Spirit is flying . Well He got to going so high and fast and the Indian people got to calling Him and He had to look down because He was the Great Spirit you know . And He had to listen . Had to answer . And He got so busy looking at the ground that He crashed . Yes He fell right to earth . Thud . ( HE LOOKS AT HER . ) Thud . ( HE TRIES TO PUT HIS ARMS AROUND HER AND PULL HER DOWN WITH HIM. ) p. 3 INDIAN WOMAN My eyes are shut . My ears are closed . HALFBREED MAN I 've been gone since last summer . Now it 's spring . I 'm returned like the sun . Are n't you glad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The trees shed . The snow falls . The trees get their leaves again . Do they ask your help ? How can you guide those white soldiers ? It 's like leading a storm to our door . HALFBREED MAN Because I know the river and the way north to the headwaters . INDIAN WOMAN You know what I mean . HALFBREED MAN Because my father was white and I speak their language . They paid me well . I bought a steel trap . ( HE DEMONSTRATES AND IT SNAPS SHUT . ) And see what I brought you  --  these garters . ( HE GIVES HER TWO RED LEG-BANDS . ) INDIAN WOMAN ( SHE LOOKS AT THEM . ) Where do you wear them ? ( SHE TRIES TO TIE ONE ON AS A HEADBAND . ) HALFBREED MAN They go on your leg . ( SHE TIES IT AT HER KNEE . ) No , like this . ( HE TRIES TO TIE IT HIGHER. ) p. 4 INDIAN WOMAN Do white women wear these ? HALFBREED MAN They wear them higher  --  like this  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a deer . Make me another deer antler rake . Find some chokecherry . Dream a name for the child . Draw a birchbark scroll for his life 's path . Paddle the boat while I gather rice with my cedar rice-beaters . Trample the rice once it 's gathered . Repair my bear-paw snow shoe . Find some pine-pitch . Bear-grease . Spruce-gum so my birchbark basket wo n't leak maple syrup . You could bring me an iron kettle from the fur traders instead of their garters . But no . You lead the white man north along a river . They 'll take our way of life . The elders say so . I feel it also in my heart . Sometimes they call you a half-breed traitor . HALFBREED MAN Then why do you want me to name the child ? INDIAN WOMAN Because I do . A name is the pine-pitch that holds you together . Otherwise your arm would fall off when you lifted the bow . Your knees would turn when you wanted to go straight . It 's like knowing your history . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Northwest Company Post had a door . To hold it closed there were lead musket-balls in a sock tied on a string as a weight . The door swings . ( HE HAS TROUBLE EXPLAINING THIS . ) Well like the deer-hide flap on the teepee door , but it swings inward . p. 5 INDIAN WOMAN What 's a sock ? HALFBREED MAN An over-the-foot . ( HE PUTS HIS HAND OVER HIS FOOT TRYING TO EXPLAIN THIS TOO . ) A thin moccasin . ( LIFTS HER FOOT INTO THE AIR AND PUTS HIS HAND OVER IT TO MAKE THE MOTION OF PUTTING ON A SOCK . ) But under the moccasin  --  INDIAN WOMAN Soon it will be black-fly season . I could use a door with a weight . In the meantime I 'll smoke moss over the fire and keep them away . ( SHE FANS THE FIRE . ) HALFBREED MAN They have guns that can kill anything  --  man or animal  --  if they can hit it . ( PANTOMIME OF HORNED ANIMAL BEING STALKED BY WHITE HUNTER BUT ESCAPING . ) They have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stamina . Ideas come to them . They have a way of telling how cold it is . They have numbers for the cold . And numbers for how far they 've gone . All day the leader kept taking notes in his book  --  ( SCRIBBLES IN AN IMAGINARY BOOK . ) They tell the directions by a needle under a glass . They make doors close by a weight . A sock is something that goes under the moccasin and over the foot . A between-them . The way the moon looks in the day sky . An image almost . A ghost moccasin . That 's a sock . p. 6 INDIAN WOMAN What is the purpose of this ghost moccasin ? Other than to hold doors closed ? HALFBREED MAN No it holds the foot closed . It keeps the boot from rubbing a sore on the toes and heel . It keeps the foot warm so they do n't get sick . INDIAN WOMAN Our people die from their diseases . HALFBREED MAN The white man does n't know how to hunt , yet he endures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have many stories to tell . INDIAN WOMAN How can anyone survive without stories ? HALFBREED MAN They have stories written in a book . But not stories like we tell . INDIAN WOMAN They ca n't be stories then . HALFBREED MAN They are . I 've heard some of them . A man in a boat and another man on a cross . INDIAN WOMAN We have a cross on our birchbark scrolls that tell our sacred stories . HALFBREED MAN But it stands for the four directions . It 's not the kind of cross in their book . My father wanted me to study it , but I would rather stay in the woods . ( HE TICKLES HER. ) p. 7 INDIAN WOMAN Our stories carry us like a canoe . That 's what stories do . I tell stories to myself when you 're gone . HALFBREED MAN When I was a boy my mother and father died within two days of each other . My father died of a hunting accident . My mother died in childbirth . I went into the woods . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but water for seven days , and a man and woman came to me . They said your grandmother is crying for you . What are you doing here ? They asked . Then they changed into bears and walked away . I must have gone to sleep then and had a dream . A wind came and brought the sound of a drum . I saw the drum in my dream . It was painted red and blue . I saw that the red was for the rising sun . But the blue was for the land still left in darkness . It was that darkness from which a storm came . I sang my song and said storm you go around the other way . You do n't run over me . I said hey storm . Hey you storm . Go the other way . Afterwards , I went home and lived with my grandmother . I sing that song now and beat my drum . I tell the story of how I got my song . Sometimes the storm goes away . INDIAN WOMAN They wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be broken forever like ice on the creek where a tomahawk falls . HALFBREED MAN I will sing my song . INDIAN WOMAN I will sing mine as I stir the maple syrup . Mey mey mey mey . I make my song the way cottonwood leaves rise and fall with the wind . My baby hears my voice and knows I am near . Mey mey mey mey . Once the maple syrup fell like rain . But Wenebojo , our trickster , decided that was too easy . The Indian had to work . We had to make an offering of tobacco . We had to put a small piece of wood into the tree so the sap would run out . Catch it in a birchbark basket . We had to cut wood . Boil sap for a long time . Boil it until it is maple syrup . Boil some of the syrup longer until it is maple sugar . ( SOUND OF THUNDER. ) @x FISH SPEARING SEASON ( SUMMER ) . THE INDIAN MAN AND WOMAN SIT IN THE TEEPEE FOR COVER DURING THE THUNDERSTORM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE CANOE WITH HIS LURE AND SPEAR . THE WOMAN CUTS THE FISH INTO STRIPS AND DRIES THEM . SHE ALSO RAKES THE GROUND AND GATHERS WILD ONIONS , WALNUTS AND BERRIES . INDIAN WOMAN The thunder sounds to me now like the white man . Will they buy the blades of grass ? How much for the clouds ? HALFBREED MAN Listen to the thunderstorm . Forget the people moving into our land . INDIAN WOMAN All we have is rain . And the thunder of their guns . Do you have a name for the baby yet ? ( SHE USES MOSS FOR THE BABY 'S DIAPER . ) HALFBREED MAN I have n't dreamed of one . What 's your hurry ? INDIAN WOMAN Then tell a story . HALFBREED MAN You know how we always move from one place to another . From maple-sugar camp to fishing camp to ricing and berry-picking camp to hunting camp . Sometimes just moving . Here and there . ( HE MARKS ON THE GROUND . ) HO . Here . Then ho ho . There . We never stayed just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indian is always moving . Well , the land got to feeling the Indian moving all over it . Just squirming like a trail of ants always walking . Like a swarm of bees always buzzing in its ear . ( THE INDIAN TICKLES THE WOMAN 'S EAR . ) The land decided it wanted to move too . It said I will just rearrange myself . One night a thunderstorm happened . A giant thunderstorm . It parted the darkness until the sky was white with lightning . They watched the thunderstorm jump up and down over the land . It jumped and snorted and tossed away the darkness until . Thud . The Indians saw some of the land get up and walk off . Yes the land rearranged itself . It decided to move too . So a part moved away . Just like that . No one knows where it went . p. 10 INDIAN WOMAN Your story worries me . I do n't want part of the land to leave . The others will hear your story and be afraid . Stop the storm , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoot the clouds . Make the sun come back . Make the summer come . ( HE SHOOTS INTO THE SKY . ) Where will we go when they take the land ? ( SHE TALKS WHILE THE MAN CLICKS ROCKS TO START A FIRE . ) HALFBREED MAN We wo n't go anywhere . We belong with the animals and trees and rivers . We 'll be here as long as the land is . INDIAN WOMAN What do their Grandfathers say about them coming ? HALFBREED MAN They do n't talk to their Ancestors . INDIAN WOMAN They do n't talk to their Grandfathers ? HALFBREED MAN They do n't see ghosts . INDIAN WOMAN What drives them up the river to make marks of land on their map ? To set up villages behind walls ? There 's a new fort just across the river . ( SHE SCRAPES THE GROUND WITH HER DEER ANTLER RAKE . ) HALFBREED MAN The map makes them feel less a stranger to the land . They change the names of rivers and lakes from our words to theirs . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreamed of him standing mid-air . Trying to find a place to put his feet . The land did n't feel like home to him and he dug and looked and smelled and poked , trying to make a place he felt was his . He does n't know where he 's walking . It 's because he wears hard boots and does n't know the land is his mother . p. 11 INDIAN WOMAN He wo n't hear the voice of the earth . He does n't know it 's part of us . He wo n't have dreams . HALFBREED MAN Maybe there are men who can live without vision . INDIAN WOMAN Who can live without dreams ? Remember those people in your dream when you were a boy ? You said they turned into bears . They were your parents talking to you after their death . They wanted you to live . Where would you be without their dream ? ( HERE THE INDIAN TURNS AWAY FROM HER AND FISHES . ) Mey mey mey mey . ( SHE SINGS TO HER BABY AND SOON TIES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IS MUSIC IN PREPARATION FOR THE BEAR DANCE . THE MUSICIAN IS IN A MASK . HE BEATS THE DRUM AND ACTS LIKE A BEAR . HE JUMPS AROUND THE INDIAN MAN AS HE FISHES . THE WOMAN JOINS HIM AS THE OTHER BEAR . THEY MOTION FOR THE INDIAN MAN TO FOLLOW . THEY SHOW HIM WHERE TO FISH . ONE OF THEM CARRIES THE SUN . @x WILD RICE SEASON ( FALL ) . FIRST , THE DANCE . LATER , THE WOMAN SITS IN THE CANOE WHILE THE MAN PADDLES . SHE GATHERS RICE INTO THE CANOE WITH THE RICE STICKS . THEY DRY THE RICE ON THE GROUND , PARCH IT IN A KETTLE TO LOOSEN THE HUSKS , FAN IT , TRAMPLE OR JIG IT , FAN AGAIN AND TRAMPLE . HALFBREED MAN ( IN HIS RED &amp; BLUE MASK . ) I am a Spirit person . I have walked over the boundary . I 'm in the Spirit world . I dance . I talk to the earth . Which plants can I use for healing ? Where are the fish ? When is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tells me . The eagle drops his feather for me . I hear the voice of the bird . The voice of the bear blesses my lure and spear . I give thanks to the fish for his life . I give thanks to the river for the wild rice . I talk to the wind and rain . I say rain go around us . Rain you stay over there . Over the walled fort  --  make mud up to their knees . Ho ho . Ha ha . Sink their boats . Stop their forward going . Make the rain to rise above their ears . ( THE THREE DANCERS MAKE A COMIC ACT OF ROWING AND DROWNING . ) INDIAN WOMAN This is the dancing we do . On my bird face is the rising sun and the land still in darkness where the winds rise . Go around me I say . What are you doing here ? Go around me I say . Tell me bird . How to fly ? Flap . Flap . How to fall to earth ? Thud . ( THE TWO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THEN GETS UP . ) How to survive the fall ? ( AFTER DANCING . ) Tell me . What is the truth of those who come ? p. 13 HALFBREED MAN I do n't know . INDIAN WOMAN You traveled with the white man for a summer and winter . You know about his Bible and you do n't know his truth ? I think they say they have one truth , and anyone who does n't believe it , does n't have truth . HALFBREED MAN What is truth to you ? INDIAN WOMAN Why do you ask me ? HALFBREED MAN Because you think there 's just one truth . INDIAN WOMAN The elders say that truth is written on our birchbark scrolls . HALFBREED MAN The white men have a truth too . Something that makes them go on . I 've seen them cough up blood from carrying their heavy barrels and canoes . I 've seen them hungry . Sometimes their feet were so swollen they could hardly walk . INDIAN WOMAN I thought you said they have a sock . HALFBREED MAN They had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chief offered a squaw to the white man who was the leader and he refused , saying he already had a wife . The chief said many men had many wives , even during one winter . But he still refused . INDIAN WOMAN Truth is what the birchbark scrolls say . Our Elders and Grandfathers speak truth . The earth speaks truth . Truth is what we hear in our stories . p. 14 HALFBREED MAN But our stories have different voices . We tell stories in our own way . I have stories . The Elders have stories . INDIAN WOMAN They are n't that different . I hear truth when you speak . I hear truth in the Elder 's stories . Truth is like water through a gorge . HALFBREED MAN The white men have a way to live too that carries them like a canoe . INDIAN WOMAN I wo n't hear it . They kill the game we hunt for food . They say they buy our land . But the land was given to us . How can something like truth be changeable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives . Life is changeable like the seasons . I think it must change form to meet different needs at different times . The white man searches for the source of the Mississippi . The river may have several sources . Could truth have several headwaters also ? Yet flowing into one stream ? Could the blood of red and white mix like rivers yet flow together in one Great River ? INDIAN WOMAN That ca n't be . HALFBREED MAN Yet truth is lasting . It 's like the change that the birch tree makes before it becomes our scrolls . Sometimes it 's invisible . When it 's in the seed . Then it 's a sapling . Then a tree . You peel the bark when it 's easy to peel . Then it 's in a different form . You sew it with cedar root . And it has another shape . You draw on it with lines from a pointed stick dipped in red ochre . The birchbark scrolls have many shapes . They tell many stories . Yet they are always birchbark . They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From camp to camp . p. 15 INDIAN WOMAN When I see the white man , I see a beaver damming one little creek until the backed-up water spills into the woods and kills the trees . HALFBREED MAN You worry for nothing . INDIAN WOMAN Your eyes are closed with buffalo robes . Your ears are blocked with beaver dams . HALFBREED MAN Only the Great Spirit knows the truth . He 's the all-knowing Truth Teller . Our way is covered by a blanket . Slowly I feel the darkness more each day . But there is truth in the end . We may not see it at the moment . INDIAN WOMAN They 're a people who wo n't hear , wo n't speak to the spirit world to know things . They push on like the stories of the glacier . The glaciers pushed and our people moved . This is the trail of my mother , the trail of my grandmother . What trail will the baby have ? I do n't want to lose the land . I feel like an animal in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DOES BEADING WORK . ) Mey mey mey . ( SHE SINGS TO THE BABY . TIES A SMALL FIR BOUGH TO THE CRADLE BOARD . ) The baby watches this and counts the Ancestors in the needles . HALFBREED MAN Our birchbark scrolls say that from our first home along the eastern sea . We wear the seashell to remember our home . Our Grandfathers moved westward by the coming of the white man . Farther and farther across the Great Lakes to the Great River Mississippi . Our path is sometimes blocked by evil spirits who appear as horned serpents or great fish . But our helpers are there too . p. 16 INDIAN WOMAN You 're so hopeful . HALFBREED MAN Maybe the Great Spirit and their God are one . The good times are under a blanket for a while but they return . The Great Spirit calls all men together in the smoke of the peace pipe . INDIAN WOMAN All lakes and rivers now will run with our tears . The wolf , fox , buffalo , prairie mole , goose , duck . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It ca n't get along without the animals . My heart curls like smoke from the fire . HALFBREED MAN Our scrolls tell about our power . Our vision quests . We see the Ancestors who cheer us on and protect our path . We are young faces of the old faces . ( HE PUTS ON A MASK AND TAKES IT OFF. ) @x WINTER CAMP SEASON ( WINTER ) . THE WOMAN WRAPS THE BLANKET OVER THE TRIPOD WITH THE LODGE POLES STICKING UP AT THE TOP FOR A TEEPEE . SHE HANGS UP THE HIDE-STRETCHER AND SNOW SHOES . INDIAN WOMAN What will happen to us ? I see more of them all the time . I see them with eyes like maple sugar . Some of them have hair yellow as the tamaracks in fall . I see their stars on their flag at the new fort . I remember when I was a girl . We belonged to the whole earth . HALFBREED MAN The part of it we knew anyway . INDIAN WOMAN The women did n't hurry to the river for water . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep . Our children did n't know fear unless a bear sniffed at the teepee at night . Or the wolf howled at the flap . I feel something inside me . My skin grows cold . My heart is a hard pellet . Like buckshot from muskets that hangs on doors . There 's something that wo n't go away . HALFBREED MAN When we smoke the peace pipe , we have communion with the Great Spirit and all living creatures . ( THEY LIE BESIDE ONE ANOTHER AS HE TALKS . HIS ARM IS UNDER HER HEAD . HER ANKLE HIS OVER HIS LEG . THEIR LEFT HANDS HOLD AT THE THUMBS . ) There 's a story of men who would come to take the earth away from us . Even the stars . I look at the night sky and think , how can that be ? Yet I know our legends are true . p. 18 INDIAN WOMAN But the Great Spirit saved some stars for the Indian  --  inside the twig of the cottonwood . Maybe it will be all right . While you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apple crosswise for me . I saw the star inside the apple too . Just like in the twig of the cottonwood . I gave him the sparrow-bone bracelet for it . I did n't like the bracelet anyway . Sleep a while and I will pray for you . ( SHE SITS UP AND HE RESTS HIS HEAD IN HER LAP . ) When he sleeps I hear him snore . I think of his wolf-growl when he plays with the children . I think of the children as they die from the white man 's diseases . I hear them cough in their teepees . My sister 's two children have already died . I look at my baby . Then I feel the cold place inside me again . There 's another kind of darkness out there now . ( THE INDIAN MAN DREAMS . A DEER DANCER ENTERS BEATING A DRUM . MOTIONING TO FOLLOW . ) HALFBREED MAN ( HE WAKES . ) I dreamed a name for the baby . He-who-sees-the-way . INDIAN WOMAN What does it mean ? HALFBREED MAN I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? He will have to discover what it means . He 's the one who follows the new ways . Maybe he 's the one who can walk where we ca n't . Maybe he will show us a way when our life comes to a close . p. 19 INDIAN WOMAN How would you draw the scroll for his life 's walk ? HALFBREED MAN I would mark four stages for his life on the birchbark . Before each one are obstacles . But there are guardian bear spirits , and beaver spirits guiding him , and elders protecting him , and the four winds and four directions to help him , and the birds to carry his prayers . ( PAUSE . ) INDIAN WOMAN You are thinking of the obstacles ? HALFBREED MAN Yes . I 'm thinking of what 's coming for him  --  I do n't want you going to the new fort anymore . INDIAN WOMAN It seems to me I should learn to go to the fort . I want their calico . And **37;692;TOOLONG . ( SHE MAKES SCISSOR-MOTIONS WITH HER FINGERS . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flower-patterns . I want to see a door close with a sock . I want to know how they survive their sickness . The spots-on-the-face . The coughing-up disease . The no-strength-sleep of our children . I will have to walk in a place where there 's no path . That 's what our lives will be . HALFBREED MAN ( HE STANDS AND TAKES THE SNOW SHOES . ) I remember the story of the Great Spirit 's flying lesson . He flew and crashed . Maybe it will be that way for us also . The Great Spirit of the white man fell to earth also . They put him on a cross . Maybe our thud is coming . If the Great Spirit thuds and survives , then we can too . p. 20 INDIAN WOMAN Where are you going ? HALFBREED MAN To see if anything is in the trap . INDIAN WOMAN Do n't go yet . HALFBREED MAN We need the meat and skins . ( HE EXITS TO THE EDGE OF THE STAGE . ) INDIAN WOMAN Sometimes I 'm afraid he wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the winter , the evil spirit , Windigo , comes bringing sickness and death . One winter , when the men were out hunting , there was no one strong or brave enough to go out and face Windigo . So a small girl walked out on the lake carrying two sumac sticks . As she walked , she grew stronger , and the sticks of sumac froze hard as stone . She attacked the Windigo monster , crushing his skull . ( AFTER THE STORY , THE INDIAN WOMAN SITS ROCKING THE CRADLE BOARD FOR A MOMENT . THEN SHE TALKS TO THE BABY . ) I name you He-who-sees-the-way . You 're the one who will lead . I mark you with bravery . I say there is a way where none is . I say you are a Truth Teller . And I say it to the children who come after you . You 'll see in your own way . You will see a way . HALFBREED MAN I hear you , earth . You are myself . A part of you is leaving . I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know how to walk in more than one world . p. 21 INDIAN WOMAN Do I not have two feet ? One for the path of each world . ( HERE THE INDIAN ATTEMPS TO FLY , AND IN FALLING , EXITS . THE INDIAN WOMAN TALKS TO THE BABY . ) In time you 'll have a birchbark scroll which will help you with your walk . Maybe you will make new stories . Because with stories we will know the way .
