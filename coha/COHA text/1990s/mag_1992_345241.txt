1 THE CLARENCE THOMAS/ANITA HILL HEARINGS <P> In a year when real-life courtroom drama became the stuff of TV entertainment , a Supreme Court nominee 's droning confirmation process was suddenly transformed into a riveting version of Rashomon . On one side was the composed college professor charging sexual harassment ; on the other the outraged judge crying racism ; in the jury box , a gaggle of Senators fumbling . After this and the William Kennedy Smith rape trial , how can anybody watch L.A. Law again ? <P> 2 . HOUSE OF CARDS ( PBS ) . <P> Masterpiece Theatre has had precious few masterpieces in the past few years , but this intricate , lacerating political thriller atoned for a lot of boring nights with Alistair Cooke . Ian Richardson played a conniving Tory leader who took us into his confidence as he schemed and blackmailed his way to the top . If only real political skulduggery were this much fun . <P> 3 . THE SIMPSONS ( Fox ) . <P> O.K. , we were wrong . Everybody 's favorite cartoon show seemed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than satire . But this season Homer has supplanted Bart at the program 's center , and the series has soared to inventive new heights , skewering everything from multinational corporate takeovers to America 's Funniest Home Videos . No doubt anymore : it 's TV 's most dangerous sitcom . <P> 4 . THE SCHWARZKOPF BRIEFING . <P> Maybe the best army recruiting ad since John Wayne 's farewell to his troops in She Wore a Yellow Ribbon . In explaining before a rapt press corps how the gulf war was won , the general embodied a nation 's ideal of the perfect warrior : tough , professional , charismatic , compassionate . And gave a great lesson in military tactics in the process . Now if we could just figure out what it was all for . <P> 5 . PUBLIC ENEMY 2 ( Showtime ) . <P> SCTV alum Dave Thomas times two : as a luckless actor who plays a serial killer on a TV true-crime show , and as the real serial killer who gets revenge for the indignity . This cable special could have settled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does to perfection . But it grew swiftly into a hilarious satire of America 's celebrity obsession . <P> 6 . CONEY ISLAND ( PBS ) . <P> The Burns boys are TV 's hottest brother act . PBS 's blockbuster The Civil War , which Ken directed and Ric helped write , was the TV event of 1990 . Ric was responsible for this smaller slice of Americana , a wistful look at the glory days of America 's greatest amusement park . The turn-of-the-century film clips were nostalgic yet startling , the documentary enthralling . <P> 7 . THIRTYSOMETHING ( ABC ) . <P> The quintessential yuppie drama for the ' 80s had begun to grow a bit thin and self-indulgent as the new decade dawned . But with its end drawing near and character crises mounting  --  a cancer scare , a sudden death  --  the show revealed that it was made of sterner stuff . No network series has captured a milieu with such uncompromising fidelity . And Homefront is no substitute . <P> 8 . NAKED HOLLYWOOD ( A &E).; <P> Egotistical producers , pampered actors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was on hand as the BBC poked its nose into the film capital . But producer Nicolas Kent enlivened the old story with an outsider 's perspective and a filmmaker 's brashness . <P> 9 . IN BROAD DAYLIGHT ( NBC ) .
