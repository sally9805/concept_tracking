##@x <p> I never thought I 'd find myself feeling sorry for Warren Beatty . This aging , crinkly-eyed Lothario , with his implacable yen for ever-younger and more visible specimens of femaleness , is hardly the sort of man to strike a chord of sympathy in a woman 's heart . <p> Still , as I watched Mr. Beatty play  --  or try to wiggle his way out of playing  --  the assigned role of Boy Toy in Madonna 's " Truth or Dare , " I felt myself wince . In one scene , Mr. Beatty , famously ambivalent about the limelight , is urged by Madonna to venture closer toward the camera . The vulgar moniker with which she commands him reduces the actor to his licentious absurdum . This is not lost on Mr. Beatty , who looks stricken . <p> Women , of course , have been enduring this kind of ostensibly good-hearted erotic ribbing for time immemorial . Undoubtedly , many of them feel that their sex is vindicated by gestures such as Madonna 's  --  and that men are getting their long-overdue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Madonna 's canniness that she has correctly gauged the current sexual climate , one that has cooled on feminist ideals at the same moment it has warmed to a strikingly adolescent hostility toward men . <p> I would like to suggest that this climate is the least conducive to a serious consideration of the " battle of the sexes " as any I can personally recall . I came of intellectual age in the mid-1970 's , just after the first fervent wave of feminism had crested . Though the women 's movement had its share of inane posturing , it was also genuinely committed to the possibility of change : the fundamental issues of sexual identity were attacked head-on . <p> Side by side with the hysteria of bra-burning came an important reassessment of the custodial rights a woman had over her own body  --  and over the life of her unborn child . One did not have to agree with the premises of the women 's movement , much less its proposed solutions , to understand that the biological accident of gender was no longer to be taken for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men and women , at a very different cultural moment  --  one in which we are newly fascinated with epically conceived models of masculinity and femininity . So we find ourselves with , on the one hand , the men 's movement , which addresses what the best-selling author Robert Bly terms " father hunger " by invoking a lost paternal tradition of masculine essence via weekend retreats with " talking sticks " and communal sessions in " sweat huts . " On the other hand , we find women seeking to ape the most reflexive , least-developed aspects of the male psyche  --  as though this primitive turning-of-the-tables could actually work . <p> The latter behavior is exemplified at the more rarefied levels of culture by the intellectually specious swaggering of the anti-feminist critic Camille Paglia , and at the more popular level by the wildly celebrated rampaging of the two macho cowboyettes in " Thelma and Louise . " <p> What " Thelma and Louise " has going for it is a knowing , twangy score and supersaturated shots of a landscape that is particularly American in its arid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets some tiny details right  --  the way , for instance , Thelma takes rapid bites from a candy bar that she keeps firmly replacing in the freezer . <p> But these things are surely not what the brouhaha is about . Much has been made of " Thelma and Louise 's " exuberant sense of anarchy , of its being the first on-the-road movie to feature two of the finer sex . And I suppose it is nice " to see two women acting like thugs for a change , " as one woman explained to me . Especially , I might add , if the thugs are as good-looking and sedulously toned as Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon . <p> When they 're not getting fired up at the various male baboons and pigs they encounter on their trip  --  the worst of whom they kill  --  they 're even capable of showing their daintier , more classically feminine sides : Thelma prefers miniature , airplane-sized bottles of liquor to the " large , economy size , " Louise is a whiz at applying lipstick between getaways , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assisted color of which matches the setting sun . <p> The great excitement about " Thelma and Louise , " according to one television commentator , is that it describes " the liberating road to self-destruction . " In other words , after racing from one neon-lit road stop to another , the two buddies commit suicide by driving off the edge of a cliff rather than give themselves up to the police . <p> I hated the movie and I must say that I find it more than a little curious that just as men are looking inward to find their more intimate , " feeling " selves , women are looking outward to find the black-leather-jacketed biker inside . " Thelma and Louise , " by presenting two women who try to shoot their way out of their claustrophobic , male-defined lives , brings us to a dead end in the heterosexual chase . <p> No wonder even inveterate womanizers like Warren Beatty have been scared off . For , lo and behold , comes the news last week that Mr. Beatty , the old goat , has gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the woods , getting in touch with his inner warrior ? Or is it simply getting too hairy out there in male-bashing land ? @@649969 St. Petersburg , Russia <p> Mack Bolan gazed out his hotel-room window and saw four armed men exit a sedan in front of the building . He immediately moved from the window to the nearby table , where he shrugged into the nylon shoulder holster that bore his Beretta 93-R . Then he donned a cream-colored sports jacket to hide the weapon . <p> As Bolan left the room and headed for a set of back stairs that provided the fastest unobstructed route to the first floor , he thought back on Hal Brognola 's briefing . <p> " Her name is Kisa Naryshkin , " said Hal Brognola , director of the Sensitive Operations group , America 's ultra-covert antiterrorist organization based at Stony Man Farm in Virginia . " And according to our intelligence , she 's the only link we have to Leonid Rostov and Sergei Cherenko . <p> " While this one falls totally under the jurisdiction of the CIA , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to act as backup , Striker , " Brognola had told him . <p> " You 're worried this might go hard , " Bolan replied . <p> Brognola nodded . " Yeah . The guy they have there to oversee the transfer is Lyle Carron , and he 's got a lot of years with the Company . He 's one of their top agents on the Russian desk , as I understand it . George Bal-ford 's another story , though . The guy 's only three months out of Langley , background in accounting . " <p> Bolan frowned . " When is the CIA going to learn that bean counters are n't exactly the best choice for these types of operations ? A sensitive case like this requires a certain expertise . " <p> " That was our assessment , as well , " said Barbara Price , Stony Man 's mission controller . " That 's why we felt it was best to call you in on this one . Rostov and Cherenko claim to have information critical to uncovering some type of terrorist attack against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Se-vooborot Molodjozhny , also known as both the Youth Revolution and the SMJ , has made some type of handshake agreement with them , where the JI will provide the SMJ arms and training . " <p> " For what ? " Bolan asked . <p> " That 's what we do n't know , " Brognola replied . " All Rostov and Cherenko can tell us right now is that this has something to do with a plot against America . " <p> " Sounds thin , " Bolan said . " If the JI 's planning a terrorist attack against us , I do n't see any logical connection to a militant youth organization inside Russia . " <p> " Maybe not , but the President thinks it 's vital we keep our thumb on this one until the transfer 's complete . That 's where you come in . " <p> Under other circumstances Mack Bolan might have passed , but something in his gut told him this went deep enough that he needed to get closer . And as he had no love for either militant Russian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite outspoken of their hatred for America and her people  --  the Executioner decided to accept the mission and see what came of it . <p> The Executioner pushed through the door at the first-floor landing that opened onto a hallway running along the east-side front of the hotel . He got his first view of the scene unfolding ahead . The doors were closed , shooting and screams had ensued , and a lone armed man had crouched at the door leading into the conference room , apparently unsure of what to do next . Bolan catfooted up the hall and entered through the double doors of an adjoining conference room . In the early hours of that morning , he 'd paced the empty halls and accessed each conference room  --  mapping the approximate square footage and other important details of this wing  --  and then returned to his room where he sketched the layout . From his recon , Bolan had made some tactical decisions and picked the lock of the door leading to the room adjoining the one where the CIA agents would be waiting to rendezvous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bolan had detached the divider separating the two conference rooms and left it slightly ajar to facilitate an alternate entrance and access if it became necessary . <p> Unfortunately it had . <p> Bolan let the door close behind him with a barely audible click . He waited long enough for his eyes to adjust to the light that emanated from the adjoining conference room , then made his way to the divider . Sidling up to the break in the divider , he took in the site with a practiced eye . The four men had moved the hostages to the back wall and lined them up single file on their knees with their hands on top of their heads . Good . That would keep the innocents out of his line of fire . <p> He then noticed the bloodied body of a young , fresh-faced man , a pistol lying just out of reach . It was George Balford . He recognized the face from the dossier provided by Stony Man . The poor kid had n't even known what hit him , probably , and if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ career . So that meant Car-ron was out of the room when the gunmen had entered . <p> Bolan moved the divider slightly as the gunmen paced up and down the line , shouting at their hostages in a mix of Russian and English . He sighted on the closest gunman first , took a deep breath , let out half and then squeezed the trigger . The Beretta coughed discreetly as the 9 mm subsonic bullet crossed the expanse in a millisecond and punched through the target 's throat . The SMG clattered on the floor as the gunner raised his hands to his throat , then staggered . <p> The Executioner already had the second man in his sights before the body of the first hit the ground , and he squeezed off another shot . The round punched into the gunner 's breastbone and continued into his lung . The impact drove the man backward into his partner , who was apparently reacting to the falling body of the first man . While the third man tried to disentangle himself from his falling partner , the fourth gunman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area , fanning his weapon left and right . <p> The sound of a door flying open briefly drew everyone 's attention from the carnage . Bolan 's eyes flicked toward the front in time to see Carron burst through the doorway . The fourth man at the far end now had a visible target and swung his SMG into target acquisition , but he was too late . The .45-caliber pistol in Carron 's grip boomed twice . Both rounds landed on target , punching through the man 's stomach . Bolan gritted his teeth against the possibility one of them might continue through and strike a hostage , but his fears were never realized . <p> Bolan reacquired a sight picture on the remaining gunner as the man triggered a burst in Carron 's direction that sent the CIA agent diving for cover . The weapon skewed upward and delivered a flurry of rounds harmlessly into the corkboard ceiling as the Executioner pumped two slugs through the man 's skull . The bullets split his head clean open and dumped him to the floor . <p> In a snap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room . He opened the door , peered into the hallway and then made for the steps when he verified it was empty . As the Executioner pushed through the door and climbed the stairwell he considered the situation at hand . The St. Petersburg police would undoubtedly swarm the building in the next ten minutes , which did n't give him much time . He could n't remain in his room  --  they would conduct a door-to-door search , to be sure , and that meant a lot of uncomfortable questions . He would have to exit by the first-floor window of the rear stairwell . He could stow the pistol in a locker of one of the nearby train stations , so if they cordoned the area he would n't get caught with a weapon . <p> Bolan went quickly through his room , left the clothes hanging in the closet and the bag of toiletries on the sink , and removed only his forged identification and passport and heavy overcoat . He made his exit through the rear stairwell window unobserved , donned the overcoat once outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hotel , asked if he had any messages , then hung up immediately . That would probably provide a fairly decent alibi if he was questioned by police at any later point . Bolan then headed for the train station where he could dump his armament . <p> Then it would become a waiting game . He would need to touch base with Stony Man at some point to see if he could get a line on Carron . There was no point in keeping his cover . He would need some backup in his search for the two missing contacts , and Carron seemed the most sensible one to provide that given he was out to accomplish the same end as Bolan . Things were shaping up just as they always seemed to for the Executioner . <p> Yeah . Business as usual . <p> Even with their advanced computer systems , it took Stony Man more than four hours to track down Lyle Carron . By the time Bolan found him in a small coffee shop on the outskirts of St. Petersburg , the massive clock on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inches of snow had fallen . Bolan shook the snow from his overcoat as he came through the door . He nodded at the barista , ordered a coffee in Russian and then moved over to Carron 's table . <p> " Mind if I sit down ? " Bolan asked quietly . <p> Carron 's eyes focused on Bolan 's with surprise , then the company guy gestured to a seat in front of him . Bolan sat but the two men said nothing until the barista arrived with a carafe of hot coffee and then departed . Wisps of steam danced off the coffee as Bolan poured a cup for himself and then refilled Carron 's . The Company man looked bothered , his face gaunt and drawn , and Bolan had been in the business long enough to know what was eating at him . <p> " It was n't your fault , " Bolan said . " Balford , I mean . " <p> Carron looked Bolan in the eyes , something few men seemed able to do without looking away just as quickly . While the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carron was sizing him up . Many other men had looked into those same twin points of ice blue and shrunk under the stare . Carron seemed to take little more than a passing interest , obviously trying to decide whether he could trust Bolan . <p> " How did you find me ? " When Bolan frowned , Carron waved it away and added quickly , " Never mind . Dumb question . " He took a sip of coffee and said , " You 're not Company . " <p> It was n't a question and Bolan shook his head . He extended his hand and said , " Name 's Cooper . Or Matt , if you prefer . " <p> " NSA ? " <p> " Let 's just say I 'm not on any page in the book , " Bolan said with a wan smile . <p> " The other shooter at the hotel . You ? " <p> Bolan nodded . " Sorry I did n't stick around , but I had to beat feet for the same reasons you did . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Carron said mat-ter-of-factly . " And why . " <p> " And I 'll be happy to tell you , " Bolan said . " But first I have a question for you . What do you think may have happened Rostov and Cherenko ? " <p> Carron shrugged and let out a sigh . " I figure they made someone who was onto them , maybe they had a tail . They would have known it was too risky to make the rendezvous or lead their friends from the SMJ to the hotel . Probably took them on a wild-goose chase . Either that or the SMJ caught up to them before they could meet us , tortured them for the time and place , then sent some boys to take care of me and George . " <p> " What about the car ? You did n't try to follow it ? " <p> " What car ? " <p> " The one that deposited the four hardcases outside the front door . " <p> Carron shook his head and frowned . " There was n't any car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and only thing I saw was a corpse . Figured that was your handiwork , too . " <p> " No dice , " Bolan replied . <p> The Executioner felt a knot settle in his stomach . Somebody had obviously ambushed the driver , left his carcass on the sidewalk and taken the car . All of that had probably happened during Bolan 's trip to the first floor and the subsequent gun battle . He had n't even thought about that ; he figured the driver would either get spooked after a certain amount of time elapsed and split , or the cops would pen him in and nab him when they arrived . <p> " The fact someone smoked the driver and got away means they were waiting for them , " Bolan finally said . " Either that or they saw an opportunity and decided to exploit it . " <p> " Yeah , " Carron replied . " And I do n't think it takes a genius to figure out who did it . " <p> " I sat watch on that street for more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I never saw Rostov or Cherenko . Never saw anybody . " <p> " Not your fault . The weather was shit and you could n't have figured the SMJ would try making a play with me and Balford covering all bets . Besides , you were n't there as the primary . " <p> Bolan reacted to that . <p> The CIA man smiled . " Do n't look so surprised . The Company has some sources , too . " <p> " So you knew they sent me ? " <p> " Well , not you specifically , but I figured they 'd send someone , " Carron replied . " Let 's face it . It would 've been stupid for the upper echelon in Wonderland to put all of their eggs in one basket . I think that 's what got me incensed more than anything . They put out George and me as sacrificial lambs , almost like they were expecting us to blow it . Okay , I 'm thick-skinned and I can take it , but George was barely out of college . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigarette and poured them more coffee , then said , " I get it , though . And I understand them sending you as backup . The information Rostov and Cherenko have is obviously too important to trust without some type of failsafe operation in place . For what it 's worth , pal , I 'm still glad you were there to cover my six . " <p> " Fact of the matter is , we both lost this one , " Bolan said . <p> " Maybe just the battle , " Carron replied with a wink . " War 's not over yet . Just what do these two know that 's so important ? Any idea ? " <p> Bolan be sure how much he should let on he knew . Of course , Carron would have had a general idea anyway , although maybe not privy to all the details Stony Man had given Bolan . Still , the Executioner would need all the allies he could get if he were to find Rostov and Cherenko and get them out of the country . Carron had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russian sector pretty well if the information contained in his dossier was any indication . Besides , he 'd lost his partner to this mission already and Bolan doubted he 'd be able to keep that guy at any distance . Bolan had succeeded on missions like this partly because he knew when it was appropriate to take a lone-wolf stance versus when to accept an offer of help . <br> Continues ...
