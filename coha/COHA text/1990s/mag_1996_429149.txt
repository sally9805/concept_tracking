COLD AND RAINY start to summer gave those of us in Chicago more than the usual incentive to dive into some new books . Here 's what some CENTURY staff members have been perusing : Katherine Gilbert : My summer reading began with a traditional Memorial Day trip to a bookstore in a tiny town in northern Michigan . I loaded up my backpack with books and pedaled back home . The first book I opened was Intensity , by Dean Koontz , a horrifying story about a serial killer . It 's not the type of book I usually pick up , but I wanted to be completely drawn into a story , and the book jacket alone began to do this . Chyna Philips is a 26-year-old graduate student in psychology . While she is visiting her friend Laura 's family in the hills of California , the entire family is murdered in the night while Chyna hides beneath the guest bed . If this is not hand-wringing enough ( we 're still only in chapter two ) , Chyna accidentally becomes locked in the murderer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while he begins a cross-state trek . Convinced that the murderer is holding someone captive , Chyna decides she must save the person . Chyna 's choice to take on the murderer symbolizes her decision to wrestle with and overcome her own brutal past . Next , I picked up April Sinclair 's Coffee Will Make You Black , a story about growing up on the South Side of Chicago in the 1960s . We enter Stevie 's life when she is in the sixth grade , and the book closes when she is nearing the end of high school . With humor and wisdom Sinclair reveals the complexities of living through the civil rights movement as a black child . Stevie 's mother , who very much wants Stevie to have a better life than she has had , is painfully aware of what white people think . " You ca n't just think of yourself , you have to see yourself the way others see you , " she tells her daughter . Stevie 's mother 's reserve is contrasted with the " black is beautiful " slogans that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others and to just get by , Stevie trades a perm for an Afro , joins the student civil rights movement , and is introduced to the ideas of Malcolm X. Stevie struggles with questions of sexuality as well as race . She is unsure how to interpret the fact that she prefers the comfort of the caring school nurse to the groping of her aggressive and cocky boyfriend . Sinclair depicts the painful moments of adolescence with warmth and humor . Martin E. Marty : Two books of poetry are holding my attention , and I commend them to others . Jane Kenyon 's Otherwise : New and Selected Poems is a posthumous collection . Only a few of the poems reflect on Kenyon 's last seasons , after her cancer diagnosis . She was sometimes given to melancholy and depression . In the shadows of some verses is the figure of her husband , the notable poet Donald Hall , who also was diagnosed with cancer . The book is always serious , sometimes somber-yet reading it is anything but a " downer . " The other book is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Collection of Poems . When I began to read reviews of this first-published work by a poet in her SOs , I feared that she might be a poetic analogue to , say , Grandma Moses . Instead , this is a sophisticated poet who is getting mentioned now with such writers as Elizabeth Bishop , Richard Wilbur and Marianne Moore . This is poetry with a somber and even stark edge : some poems show Adair coping with her recent blindness and with her husband 's sudden , unexplained suicide . Douglass Adair , who took his life in 1968 , was a wellknown scholar and her partner in a long and happy marriage . " I have never understood . / I will never understand , " she writes . Dean Peerman : Poignant , moving memoirs , these : An American Requiem : God , My Father , and the War That Came Between Us , by James Carroll , and The Shadow Man : A Daughters Search for Her Father , by Mary Gordon . Both Carroll and Gordon have a compelling prose style , as evidenced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catholic background , from which they have distanced themselves in differing degrees . FBI agent Joseph Carroll , James 's father , first achieved a bit of fame by putting a Chicago mobster behind bars . That deed catapulted him into J. Edgar Hoover 's inner circle in Washington , and from there he became a Pentagon power , serving as founding director of the Defense Intelligence Agency . But Joseph was also a " spoiled priest , " having forsaken seminary for love and marriage-a source of profound guilt feelings for him and his wife , Mary , given their strict Irish Jansenist kind of Catholicism . So when their first-born , Joe , was stricken with a severe case of polio , they could only interpret it as divine punishment . Conversely , when James , their second-born , was ordained a priest , it seemed a sign of divine forgiveness . During the Vietnam conflict , however , James became a prominent antiwar activist . To Joseph , this constituted a betrayal of everything he believed in . Family ironies were compounded when son Dennis became a draft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's footsteps , became an FBI agent whose job was to track down draft resisters who went underground rather than abroad . Worst of all for Joseph , James eventually concluded that , in 1991 at the age of 80 . In midlife Mary Gordon felt a need to test her memories and find out what she could about her father , who had died of a heart attack in her early childhood and whom she had long idolized . Some of her discoveries were devastating . Her father turned out to be a complex man with a decidedly dark side , a man who had lied about many things-his birth date , his birthplace , his education , his travels ( largely nonexistent ) , even his first name ( Isaac , not David ) . He had published softcore pornography in the ' ' 20s . Most disturbing of all , he was a Jew-hating Jew-a convert to Catholicism who admired Mussolini and Franco . Such revelations made Gordon 's father a man more difficult to love , of course , yet she paid him homage by disinterring him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her mother 's family plot because her " people . . . at best tolerated or patronized him , at worst despised him . " Gordon 's book is perhaps the more ambitious of the two , Carroll 's the more successful . Eloquent though The Shadow Man is , occasionally it overreaches in the direction of hyperbole and melodrama . And some of Gordon 's descriptions seem excessively harsh-particularly of her crippled mother 's " grotesque " body . But it may be that An American Requiem simply resonates more with me personally , reminding me of the years of estrangement between my own father and me following my decision , in 1950 , to seek the conscientious-objector classification rather than take the student deferment to which I was entitled . A sad but haunting book . Trudy Bush : Stranded together all night in a blizzard after attending the funeral of the man to whom they had all once been married , four women decide to keep themselves awake and warm by telling true stories they 've never told anyone before , stories " that would scorch paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ premise of Louise Erdrich 's Tales of Burning Love . In my summer reading I 'm balancing this " hot " look at romance with Doris Lessing 's decidedly cooler and more analytical Love , Again . Jack Mauser , the oft-wed husband in Erdrich 's book , has been emotionally frozen ever since the night when he married his first wife and then , drunk , let her walk off into a snow storm and freeze to death . The book recounts his painful process of coming back to life . Equally compelling is the story of each of his wives , all very different from one another and all women the reader comes to care about . This novel is the fifth in Erdrich 's series centering on characters connected to North Dakota 's Ojibway Indian reservation . Some of the characters seem like old friends by now ; others enter the cycle for the first time here . Sarah Durham , the protagonist of Lessing 's novel , is a widow in her early 60s who has lived contentedly without love for nearly 20 years . She is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ producing a play about the tragic loves of Julie Vairon , a talented artist whose life ended in suicide some 80 years earlier . In the course of the production Sarah finds herself falling wildly , improbably in love . Indeed , during the intensity and magic of the play 's successful run , nearly everyone connected with it falls painfully and inappropriately in love with each other . Durham must be one of the most analytical characters in fiction , examining and dissecting her painful emotions and keeping them carefully in check . The book is a philosophical exploration of love from the point of view of a wise , experienced old woman . Both novels are concerned with love 's relationship to the transcendent . For Jack Mauser and the ex-wife to whom he eventually returns , faith and redemption are as important as love . For Sarah Durham , " to fall in love is to remember one is in exile , " an exile from that union with the divine for which our hearts hunger . Lisa Tiede : I spent a couple of afternoons enjoying warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the careless freedom of one of those decadent all-inclusive vacations advertised in the Sunday paper . The best part was that I never faced the hassle of airport customs , took a vacation day or added another charge to my Visa debt . Terri McMillian took me on this sensory respite with her new novel , How Stella Got Her Groove Back . At 42 , Stella Payne finds herself in a mid-life crisis , tied to an unfulfilling job and burned out on parenting a pre-teen . Her therapeutic quest begins after her son leaves to spend his summer vacation with his father . On a whim she sets out for Jamaica , where she falls in love with Winston , a Jamaican man 20 years her junior . McMillian 's writing style is a combination of stream-of-consciousness , dialogue , and descriptive essay . McMillian effectively conveys Stella 's struggle to balance her own desires with the approval she seeks from her mother and sisters in her relationship with Winston . How Stella Got Her Groove Back is a good summer readan outrageous adventure , without the risk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with what 's new in children 's books . Sylvia Waugh 's books about the " Mennyms " is the best children 's fantasy series to come along in a decade . The Mennyms are a family ( three generations ) of life-size rag dolls , brought to life by their sincedeceased creator , the mysterious Aunt Kate . How they maintain a peaceful , near-human existence while avoiding discovery makes for surprisingly suspenseful reading . In the series ' first title , The Mennyms , the clan is thrown into chaos by the impending arrival of Aunt Kate 's nephew , while in Mennyms in the Wilderness ( 1995 ) the dolls are forced to take refuge in an abandoned country estate when their own beloved townhouse is threatened by a highway construction project . In the newest volume , Mennyms Under Siege , published this past spring , the dolls face potential discovery through the curiosity of a neighbor . Waugh 's rag doll family provides an irresistible medium for Waugh 's observations on the gap between " true " human identity and the societal roles we all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " at being the humans they were literally created to be , while always understanding the rules of their precarious rag doll existence . ) Great humor , charm and imagination have gone into this fabulous series . A publishing achievement is the ongoing reissue ( by Farrar , Straus Sr Giroux in simultaneous hardcover and paperback editions ) of Tove Jansson 's Moominland books . Considered a national treasure in Finland , artist and author Jansson is too-little known here and her tales of Moominvalley-originally published in the ' ' 50s and ' ' 60s-much too long out-ofprint . Debra Bendis : I was elated when I learned that a new book by Albert Camus had appeared 34 years after his death . The First Man is an absorbing , beautiful memoir of Camus 's Algerian childhood . Though it is an unfinished work-there are a few incomplete paragraphs and unexplained references-the anecdotes , character sketches and descriptive passages shape a complete and lyrical reminiscence . Camus evokes an Algeria of pungent odors , blazing sun and pervasive poverty . He recounts his efforts to avoid hated siestas next to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was late . He weaves in fragmented memories of his father , who died fighting for France in the Marne at age 29 , and devotes rich passages to his mother , who yielded control of the household to the grandmother while she herself lived in the private world of the deafmute . Camus adored her : her brief smiles , gestures and embraces were the only tenderness in his life and a focus for his intense emotions and energy . As for religion ? Stone-deaf Uncle Ernest would use grunts and slurps to " tell " the story of the priest sneaking a swallow of communion wine . Otherwise religion meant weddings and funerals . " In the wear and tear of poverty it becomes hard to find a place for religion . " Camus grew up with no father , no sense of religion or country , and no family traditions or memory . In his world , " poverty took the place of family and community " until he met a teacher who recognized his talent and helped him earn a high school scholarship . Going on to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a strange world , one no longer his . . . He would have to grow up and bring himself up alone , and it would be at the highest cost . " In other words , he arrived on the shores of France as if he were , in fact , " the first man . " Ann James : I was n't sure I 'd make it through Donald L. Miller 's City of Chicago : The Epic of Chicago and the Making of America . But Miller has a vigorous style and makes his narrative read almost like a novel . Of course , the city 's history provides great material-not many novelists ' imaginations could come up with a more riveting plot device than the Chicago fire of 1871 or more interesting characters than Philip Armour , the meat-packer , hard-driving capitalist and philanthropist extraordinaire . Since so much happened as the city grew from a negligible outpost of French-Canadian fur traders in the 1830s to the host of the World Columbian Exposition in 1893 , Miller arranges the story by theme rather than chronology . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " explains how the development of canal , lake and rail transportation was entertwined with the development of farm equipment and the establishment of the grain houses and the Board of Trade . Miller calls his work an epic . " The great theme is the battle between growth and control , restraint and opportunity , privatism and public good . " His account of a city central to the making of modern America includes both the small , anecdotal details and the broader expanse of epic . <p>
