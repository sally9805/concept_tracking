<p> The combination of economic hard times and underdog candidate strategies has made the New Hampshire presidential primary a month from today a nationally important test of voter sentiment on tougher U.S. trade policies . <p> With President Bush and the two Democrats who have led the early polls , Gov . Bill Clinton ( Ark. ) and former senator Paul E. Tsongas ( Mass. ) , all supporting open trade , the main challengers in both the Republican and Democratic contests have tied their hopes to demands that the United States take a stiffer line toward other exporters  --  especially Japan . <p> The upshot is an unplanned popular referendum in a recession-battered state on an issue becoming more important on Capitol Hill and in national politics . <p> Clyde Prestowitz , head of the Economic Strategy Institute in Washington , a writer on U.S.-Japan relations and frequent congressional witness , said Friday , " I think it New Hampshire could be very important " in shaping the next stage of the trade debate . " If the hard-line candidates do well there , the trade issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> It is unusual for one issue to become a simultaneous litmus test for rivals in both parties , but that is what has happened in New Hampshire . Private polls show many voters are worried that the United States is too complacent about its trade problems , although the voters are more divided about whether unfair competition or inadequacies in U.S. business and worker training are the main cause of the problems . <p> On the Republican side , conservative columnist Patrick J. Buchanan , Bush 's challenger for renomination , last week assailed the " failure " of Bush 's trade mission to Japan and promised to be an " America First president " who would " stand up to the tough-minded nationalists looking out for Japan first . " <p> Bush , in turn , warned repeatedly during his first visit to New Hampshire on Wednesday against " the siren 's call of protectionism " that he said would cost the state thousands of jobs and turn the recession into a repeat of the Great Depression . <p> In the Democratic contest , Sen. Bob Kerrey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a TV spot vowing to " tell the Japanese , if we ca n't sell in their market , they ca n't sell in ours . " Tsongas and Clinton have argued for liberal trade , emphasizing domestic policies they say would improve the competitiveness of U.S. industry . But Clinton has toughened his criticism of Japan 's market restrictions in recent weeks , too . <p> Unlike the others , Sen. Tom Harkin ( Iowa ) , a fourth Democratic contender , opposed giving Bush " fast-track " authority for negotiating a free-trade agreement with Mexico , a stance that endeared him to organized labor . But he and former California governor Edmund G. " Jerry " Brown Jr. , the last of the major Democratic aspirants , have not emphasized the issue as much as the others . <p> Public opinion studies show the public sees the trade issue as a complex question . Last September , the Council on Competitiveness , a private group , sponsored a national poll on the issue . It found growing concern and pessimism about the nation 's competitive position in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular " breaks the rules of fair trade , " but they also blamed U.S. economic problems more on the failings of the U.S. government , business and the American education system than on " unfair foreign competition . " <p> The tariff issue , as it was then called , was a perennial of U.S. politics from the advent of the Industrial Age after the Civil War until World War II . But from Franklin D. Roosevelt through Ronald Reagan , presidents of both parties persuaded bipartisan majorities in Congress to support efforts to lower tariffs and other barriers to international trade . <p> In the 1980s , however  --  as Japan 's persistent trade surpluses and the shift of jobs to overseas factories of U.S. companies raised apprehensions among American workers and businesses  --  some presidential candidates in both parties experimented with more " protectionist " rhetoric . <p> Former Texas governor and treasury secretary John B. Connally , a **26;648;TOOLONG , promised in the 1980 Republican presidential primary campaign to keep subsidized Japanese exports sitting " on the docks in Yokohama , " but failed to score with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D-Mo. ) won an upset victory in the Iowa presidential caucuses . That victory came both on the strength of his ad trumpeting that the popular South Korean-made Hyundai would cost $ 48,000 if the United States had the same import restrictions Korea did and Gephardt 's legislation aimed at forcing exporters such as Japan and Korea to open their markets to U.S. products . But he was unable to sustain the advantage in New Hampshire and later primaries . <p> Gephardt said in an interview last week that the last four years have seen " greater interest and understanding by people " of the trade issue . " Now , a lot more understand what we 're up against and why we have to take stronger steps . " <p> Gephardt also noted that his message was better received in Iowa , then in the throes of a farm recession , than it was in New Hampshire , which in 1988 was enjoying an economic boom . <p> Robert Shrum , the political consultant who made the Gephardt ad in 1988 and the Kerrey ad this year , agreed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tougher trade talk its power now . <p> But Will Marshall , president of the Progressive Policy Institute , a Washington think tank affiliated with the Democratic Leadership Council , which Clinton once headed , said : " I do n't think Kerrey will win New Hampshire or sustain his candidacy on a neo-protectionist basis . In the end , people know that interdependence is a fact of life . They 're all consumers of Japanese products and they do n't want to give that up . " <p> Linda DiVall , a Republican pollster who collaborated on the Council on Competitiveness survey with Democratic pollster Geoff Garin , said that " there 's a fine balancing act . In focus groups , we found that if you engage too much in Japanese-bashing , that is regarded as simplistic ; people want to know what specific ideas you have . " Garin said : " While people do n't say Japan is the main source of our economic problems , they think it is a problem . There 's a consensus in both parties that we need tougher policies . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has framed an approach that captures all of the nuances the voters see . But they agreed that Bush  --  by virtue of his incumbency  --  is most vulnerable , defending a status quo policy that is rejected as inadequate by all those who seek home remedies for the problem and by those who want to crack down on Japan . <p> Private surveys in New Hampshire show the issue has unusually high salience here and , as one pollster put it , " There 's virtually no constituency for complacency . " <p> In this environment , those backing Bush stress New Hampshire 's stake in expanding exports and foreign trade . Gov . Judd Gregg ( R ) , the chairman of the Bush reelection effort , says exports account for 35,000 jobs directly  --  and thousands more indirectly . " We have a Yankee Clipper trading heritage , " he said , adding that the free-trade agreement Bush signed with Canada offers bright prospects for the state . According to the New Hampshire International Trade Association , the state 's exports to Canada virtually doubled between 1988 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to $ 1.2 billion . <p> A key part of the state 's economic development strategy is to expand the Portsmouth docks and convert demobilized Pease Air Force Base to air cargo use , taking advantage of its proximity to European markets , Gregg said . <p> Granite State customers , as do other Americans , like imports . According to R.L. Polk Co. , of 35,128 motor vehicles sold in New Hampshire last year , 17,660  --  or half  --  were foreign-sourced , a higher market share than the national average of 40 percent . <p> " People are upset about the economy , " Gregg said , " but they buy Japanese cars .
