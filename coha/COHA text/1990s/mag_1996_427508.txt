<p> Contrary to popular belief , the brain does n't bottom out with time  --  scientists are discovering that if you use it , you wo n't lose it . <p> Just as medical researchers discovered a few decades ago that muscles weaken without repeated exercise , neuro-scientists are coming to the same conclusion about the brain  --  it rusts with disuse . <p> And just as exercise keeps people vigorous into their 70s and 80s , researchers are demonstrating that mental workouts can do the same for the aging brain . <p> Aging has long been thought to be an irreversible downhill slide into mental befuddlement . But the new research shows that was little more than a self-fulfilling prophecy , usually the result of brain disuse . <p> Furthermore , people do not lose massive numbers of brain cells each day as they grow older , as was once thought . <p> " We used to be taught we were losing nerve cells every day , something like a million a day , " said Dr. Marilyn Albert , associate professor of psychiatry and neurology at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hospital . " We 're beginning to get very good evidence that there is not a lot of neuronal brain cell loss with age . " <p> When Dr. Monte S. Buchsbaum first trained his PET ( positron emission tomography ) scanner on the brains of aging volunteers , he expected to see shrinkage in the area where memory is stored  --  confirming the widely held theory that forgetfulness increases with age as memory cells die off . <p> " Boy , were we wrong , " says Dr. Buchsbaum , director of the Neuroscience PET Laboratory at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York . Punching keys on a computer , he calls up images that compare the brains of people in their 20s to those of people in their 70s and 80s . <p> He points to the frontal lobe , also called the neocortex , where we think about thinking , where plans are made to call up memories , and decisions are executed as to how to use them in ways that provide new insights , inspiration , imagination , and creativity . <p> After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the frontal lobe glows bright yellow and red . The colorful display is an indication that radioactive sugar , which had been injected into the blood of the volunteers , was consumed as energy by billions of brain cells busily processing memory . <p> That was expected . The surprise was that the frontal lobe of a 75-year-old shone just as brilliantly after the same memory test . <p> " The good news is that there is n't much difference between a 25-year-old brain and a 75-year-old brain , " said Dr. Buchsbaum , who scanned the brains of more than 50 normal volunteers who ranged in age from 20 to 87 . <p> Findings like these are revolutionizing our understanding of me untapped powers of the brain , and they are leading to new ways of thinking of how people can maintain their brains in top shape . <p> Understanding that muscles need to be exercised had a dramatic effect on frailty in the aged . A generation ago , frailty could be seen in people in their 60s . Today frailty is not likely to be seen until people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the brain can experience that same kind of turnaround . <p> When there is a severe decline in memory and mental function , it is usually caused by such diseases as Alzheimer 's , which affects only 20 percent of the very old . Most of the other decline , the kind that people tend to fret about as they age , is now believed to be caused by a lack of mental exercise . <p> " The more levels of education you have , the more likely you are to engage in mentally stimulating activities , and that 's actually good for your brain , " Albert said . Her study of more than 1,000 people from age 70 to 80 showed that four factors seem to determine which oldsters maintain their mental agility : Education , which appears to increase the number and strength of connections between brain cells . Strenuous activity , which improves blood flow to the brain . Lung function , which makes sure the blood is adequately oxygenated . The feeling that what you do makes a difference in your life . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to ask me that years ago , and I would say we do n't have enough data to say one way or another , " Dr. Albert said . " I do n't say that anymore . I tell them that 's what the data look like  --  use it or lose it . " <p> Mental exercise , scientists are finding , causes physical changes in the brain , strengthening connections between brain cells called synapses and actually building new connections . <p> Such physical changes can occur within seconds , as when we shift attention , or they may take hours or days , as some memories are cast into the biological ingots that last a lifetime . <p> Education and interesting work protect people against Alzheimer 's disease , research shows . The more connections a person has between brain cells , the more resistant he or she is to the onslaught of this memory-robbing disorder . <p> Dr. Yaakov Stem , a clinical neuro-psychologist at Columbia University , found that people who had less than an eighth-grade education had twice the risk of Alzheimer 's as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people with lower education levels also worked at mentally unstimulating occupations , they had three times the risk of becoming demented . <p> While the research of Dr. Buchsbaum and other scientists shows that the brain remains pretty much intact as it ages , some deterioration does occur . Weak points have been discovered in specific areas of the brain that act as relay switches , passing messages between the memory bank and other parts of the brain . <p> The relay switches include the basal ganglia , which pass on commands to move muscles ; the hippocampus , which decides if memories are to be placed in short-term or long-term storage ; and the amygdala , which imprints memories with such emotions as fear and love . <p> Dr. Buchsbaum found that although the memory bank in the brains of older people glows as brilliantly as it does in younger brains , some relay switches , such as the basal ganglia , are a bit dimmer . That means the basal ganglia are less active , almost lazy . As a result , muscle coordination declines , perhaps explaining why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory problems may occur when different relay switches falter or fail to work . <p> The new findings may make it possible to identify these dim relay switches and develop techniques to brighten them up again . These could include mental exercises that stimulate specific areas of the brain such as the basal ganglia and the hippocampus , or drugs like neurotrophic factors that can reinvigorate brain cells . <p> Research indicates that certain exercises can build up specific brain areas , and some scientists are setting up programs to use this new knowledge to help learning-disabled children . <p> New research also shows that the aging brain retains much of the same capacity as a child 's brain to rewire itself . Although adult brains are not quite as good at repairs as infant brains , they still do an amazing job . <p> One of the first recorded examples of such repair occurred in 1909 when psychologist Kenneth Craik did a stupid thing , something children are always told not to do . <p> Out of scientific curiosity , Craik stared at the sun with one eye , destroying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receptors could no longer send information directly to the brain cells that process vision , so Craik 's central vision was lost in that eye . <p> Ever the scientist , Craik assiduously noted what happened to his sight . Immediately after the damage , he could n't see to aim a rifle . Words were missing from pages , and birds vanished from the sky . <p> But then a strange thing started to happen : Within a month , some of his central vision began to return , and by the end of six months , he could see normally again . <p> Only now have scientists figured out what happened to Craik . In doing so they have opened a new door into the brain , shattering the old concept that brain circuits that allow us to see , think , remember , and act were " hardwired " and never changed . <p> Rockefeller University scientists who repeated Craik 's experiment in animals found that the brain in adulthood and older age can rewire itself . In the case of the animals  --  and presumably Craik  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's damaged sensory cells made new connections to healthy sensory cells so that they could see again . <p> Evidence that the brain can repair itself has important implications for repairing damage caused by stroke , for rewiring destructive thought patterns , and for learning new skills . <p> This ability to change circuits , to change the functional properties of brain cells , is something that originally evolved to help people recover from damage to the brain , theorizes Rockefeller University neurobiologist Charles Gilbert . <p> But it was such a good adaptive device that the brain used the same mechanism of repair to construct memory . And both memory and repair depend on stimulation . <p> " As a society we tend to ignore the value of mental activity , " Gilbert said . <p> " We need to recognize the importance of challenging our minds as a vital component of health , of mental health . " <p> How easily mental function can be lost was shown in the landmark Seattle Longitudinal Study . Started in 1956 by K. Warner Schaie , who is now director of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what happens to intellectual abilities as people age . More than 5,000 people aged 20 to more than 90 are involved in the study . <p> Intellectual decline varies widely , Schaie found , depending on whether people let their minds loaf or keep them busy . One out of four 80-year-olds , for example , is as bright as he or she has always been . " There are very few toddling , senile millionaires , " Schaie said . " It takes education and resources to make and keep that kind of money . " <p> Couch potatoes , on the other hand , are the quickest to slip into intellectual limbo , he said . The danger starts when people retire , decide to take things easy , and say they do n't have to keep up with the world anymore . <p> " A vicious cycle sets in , " Schaie said . " If you do n't do an activity anymore , you begin losing the skills to do it . Then you are even less likely to engage in those activities . " <p> Bridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't . Crossword-puzzle workers do better on verbal skills , and jigsaw-puzzle players tend to maintain their spatial skills . There are many ways to exercise the brain , but you 've got to do something , Schaie said . " It 's the inactive people who tend to show the most decline . The people who are almost too busy to be studied are the ones who do very well . " <p> Seven factors stood out among those people who hung onto their intellectual prowess as they aged : A high standard of living marked by above-average education and income . A lack of chronic diseases . Active engagement in reading , travel , cultural events , education , clubs , and professional associations . A willingness to change . Marriage to a smart spouse . An ability to quickly grasp new ideas . Satisfaction with accomplishments . <p> Although some mental abilities begin to decline after the age of 60 , others , such as verbal and numeric abilities , actually increase . Schaie found that only 20 percent of adults experienced some mental decline from 60 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ; and 60 percent declined from 74 to 81 . <p> But if mental function is easy to lose through inactivity , it is just as easily reclaimed through mental retraining . Schaie and his wife , Sherry L. Willis , found that teaching oldsters new skills increased their brain power and improved their memory , intellectual gains that lasted for years . <p> Their study involved 229 people over the age of 65 . Half had declined over the last 14 years in two important areas  --  inductive reasoning , or problem-solving , and spatial orientation , or knowing how to read a map or assemble objects . The other half had remained stable in these two skills . After five hours of training with geometric shapes , 50 percent of the people who had remained the same over the 14-year period significantly increased their reasoning and spatial abilities . <p> Of those people who had declined , most improved , and an incredible 40 percent of them recovered the intellectual capacities they 'd had 14 years earlier . Furthermore , when they were retested seven years after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still ahead of their previous levels . <p> The findings suggest three ways to help the brains of older people . Training can boost intellectual power ; it can maintain mental function ; and it can reverse memory decline and the loss of other intellectual abilities . " The results of the cognitive training studies suggest that the decline in mental performance in many community-dwelling older people is probably due to disuse and is consequently reversible , at least in part , for many persons , " said Schaie . <p> Intellectual abilities increase with training , but what is going on inside the brain to make that happen ? <p> Scientists know that stimulating environments greatly increase the overall number of connections in animal brains , thereby increasing brain power . Could certain exercises build up connections in specific parts of the brain to strengthen lazy or weak relay switches that keep the brain from using its full power ? <p> To find out , Rockefeller University neuroscientist Hiroshi Asanuma trained monkeys to catch a ball . The ball was a round pellet of food that the monkey could eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor if missed . <p> The task involved two parts of the brain . One was in the sensory cortex , where information coming in through the eyes tracked the ball , and the other was the motor cortex , from which commands were sent to the arms to catch the ball . <p> Using sophisticated new technology , Asanuma found that as the catching task was mastered , communication lines between the sensory and motor cortex in the brains of the monkeys became stronger . More remarkable , he showed that there was a 25 percent increase in the number of connections along the sensory-motor communications highway . <p> No other part of the brain had an increase in connections , meaning that Asanuma was seeing for the first time the biological changes that occur when the brain learns a specific task . <p> " This had been expected for nearly a century , but it had been difficult to prove , " he said . " There 's no other way of understanding learning : There must be specific changes in the brain . " <p> Science is awakening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , said Michael Merzenich , a pioneering neuroscientist at the University of California at San Francisco ( UCSF ) . " It 's something that people do n't realize . They do n't think about the power that they have within themselves to change their brains . " <p> The problem is that the brain can organize itself in good ways , like learning to play a violin or mastering calculus , or in bad ways . When the brain wires itself in negative ways , the result is learning disabilities , obsessive-compulsiveness , or other behavioral problems . <p> When someone ca n't understand language , or ca n't read or do math , or has some behavioral problem , people tend to think it is caused by a defect in the brain . " It 's not a brain defect or limitation at all , " said Merzenich . " These kinds of problems really represent a different learning pathway that the brain has taken . Learning disabilities are usually learned . " <p> Understanding that the brain can organize itself to do undesirable things is a profound insight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now neuroscientists can better understand how behavioral problems are caused , how they can be prevented , and how they can be corrected . <p> Merzenich , one of the first scientists to show that adult animal brains undergo massive physical changes with general learning , hopes to use Asanuma 's discovery to change specific behaviors by precisely rewiring certain parts of the brain . <p> He already has had success with musicians suffering from focal dystonia , a condition in which the brain organizes itself to double up on muscle movements . A pianist , for instance , who continues to practice to improve his performance may suddenly find that when he moves one finger , the adjacent finger moves with it . <p> The two fingers ca n't be moved separately . The reason for this , Merzenich believes , is that in attempting to increase finger speed , the brain reaches a point where the signals coming in from two fingers blend into one signal . <p> Focal dystonia is an example of the way the self-organizing brain can fall into a trap in which it continually reinforces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endlessly and producing obsessions , phobias , and other behavioral problems . <p> To separate the movements of the two fingers , the brain has to be re-trained . Feedback devices  --  usually electronic instruments that measure different body responses such as muscle movement , blood flow , and temperature  --  are used to help the brain sense different movements in the two fingers . <p> " The musicians have to accomplish by dint of will and learning how to separate finger movements , " he continued . " It 's crucial that they know that they 're actually effecting independent contractions of the finger muscles . " <p> Behavioral therapists use the same kind of strategy to treat people with obsessions , compulsions , or other behavioral problems , even depression caused by negative thinking processes . " When you get over these things , you get over them on the basis of engaging the learning process , " Merzenich explained . " It involves reorganization of the brain to replace inappropriate thinking traps with more effective circuits . " <p> A similar approach is being used to help learning-disabled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Rutgers that the brains of these youngsters learned to process speech in slow motion . As a result , words in normal speech flow together and their meaning is lost . Tallal found , however , that when speech was slowed down , learning-disabled children could understand it . <p> Merzenich showed it was relatively easy to train animal brains to slow down and then speed up . First he taught animal brains to organize themselves in ways that processed sounds slowly . Then he showed that brain processing could be speeded up with new learning . <p> " That indicated to us that we could actually create the signature condition of a learning-disabled child and then reverse it , " he said . <p> Using these discoveries , the two researchers and their colleagues developed a fast and simple therapy that uses computer games to dramatically improve the speech skills of children with dyslexia and other language-based learning disabilities . <p> " We were really shocked at the improvement in these children over a relatively short course of training , " said Merzenich . In only 20 sessions that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five to ten years were able to advance more than two years in their speech skills . <p> The researchers found that language comprehension improved to normal , near normal , or above normal in children who had been two to three years behind their peers in speech skills . " The children thought they were playing a game , " Merzenich said . " They did n't realize that they were rewiring their brains . " <p> The research , which was supported by a $2.3 million grant from the Charles A. Dana Foundation , has major implications for helping children with speech and reading problems and attention deficit disorder . Language-based learning problems are estimated to affect about 10 percent of school-aged children and cost the United States about $7.5 billion annually . They are a major reason why many students drop out of school . <p> The findings are especially encouraging for children who have difficulty learning to talk ( developmental dysphasia ) or have subsequent reading problems ( developmental dyslexia ) . These disorders are notoriously difficult to treat . <p> " We believe this therapy would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available to treat these children , " Merzenich said . <p> The new therapy may also help people who have suffered strokes or other types of brain damage that have impaired their ability to talk . <p> In a typical case , a six-year-old child whose understanding of language was like that of a three-year-old , talked like a five-year-old after the brief computer therapy . <p> The children are happier and more socially active . " One father told me , ' You gave me a son I can talk to , ' " Tallal said . A mother reported that her daughter went to a party and for the first time was participating in the middle of the group , rather than on the outside . <p> Girls with language disorders tend to be shy and retiring , while boys tend to be hyperactive , inattentive , and difficult to manage . <p> Tallal found that the reason many children have speech and reading problems is that their brains can not process consonant sounds , which are spoken at a much faster rate than vowels . As a result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " da " and " ba . " <p> Normal children take only ten milliseconds to distinguish between two consonant sounds . But speech-impaired children require hundreds of milliseconds to recognize the difference between these different parts of speech . <p> It 's like taking a beginning course in Spanish and then going to Spain and expecting to speak the language . For children with language disabilities , sounds run together . They do n't make sense , <p> " Children who have trouble understanding what other people are saying to them have difficulties in developing the tools that really make us human , the ability to talk and communicate and carry on conversations , " Tallal said . <p> Language impairment inhibits the development of reading skills because understanding the sounds of words is necessary in order for the visual words to be matched with their sounds . <p> Tallal 's discovery  --  that when consonant sounds are slowed down on a recording , the children can distinguish them and learn to understand speech  --  paved the way for the computer therapy program . <p> Under the direction of William @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team devised computer games such as " Old MacDonald 's Flying Farm and Phonic Match " that the children could play on interactive multimedia CD-ROM equipment . The computer program slowed down the sound of consonants in speech and made them louder so that they could easily be distinguished by the children . <p> The computer finds a rate at which a child is 80 percent accurate at matching sounds to consonants or words . The computer scores every trial , and when a child gets two to three correct matches in a row , it speeds up the sounds slightly . <p> In the farm game , children " chase " a flying cow around the barnyard . As they do so , the computer produces a series of sounds that change unexpectedly . The child releases a button to indicate the change has been heard . <p> For example , a child might hear " pack , pack , pack , pat . " At the sound of the last word , the child reacts . <p> " If he is quick enough , he gets a point and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miller , a researcher at Rutgers University . " If it 's a miss , the cow keeps flying around . " <p> As the children become more efficient at recognizing individual sounds , the computer continually speeds up the sounds , providing rewards every time the children notch a higher speed . <p> Within a short period of time , the children are able to comprehend speech at near normal or above normal levels , indicating that their brains are being reorganized as a result of experience and training . <p> " That 's quite amazing , " said Tallal . " It 's very hopeful because it suggests that for whatever reason these children are impaired  --  and end up with language and reading problems  --  it 's fixable . " <p> The improvement appears to be permanent , because the brain of a learning-impaired child is hungry for this kind of information . It is brain food the child has not tasted before . <p> " Now that they are exercising those parts of the brain that process faster information , they 're getting that information in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to constantly strengthen their language capabilities , " Tallal said . <p> Learning-disabled children are often misdiagnosed as having an attention deficit disorder . The reason these children do not pay attention is because they do n't understand what the teacher is saying . <p> Tallal and her colleagues are developing screening tests to identify infants who may be susceptible to language disorders , so that early treatment might head off disabilities . <p> " Our hypothesis is that these children may never have these problems if we can provide them with the kind of speech that they can process and strengthen those parts of their brains that process fast combinations of sounds , " she said . <p> The actual underlying cause of speech impairment is unknown . But researchers believe that many things may contribute to the problem . Among them are ear infections that block normal hearing during a critical period of brain development , or a child simply learning the wrong way to hear sounds . <p> " There 's really nothing wrong with the learning machinery in these kids , " said Merzenich . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counterproductive for dealing with fast speech . <p> " This represents the beginning of a revolution  --  a clearer understanding that learning and self-organization of the brain have an impact not just for learning-disabled children , but for everybody .
