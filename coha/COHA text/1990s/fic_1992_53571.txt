The Stratton Military School for Boys is a quadrangle surrounded by low buildings , surrounded by a stone wall , surrounded by the mountains of north central Pennsylvania . The school is on a hillside above the white clapboard houses of the nearby town . It is a steep slope , the kind where kids might go sledding in winter . But when the school was built the hill was scraped flat where the barracks would be and they bulldozed the quad so the cadets could march . <p> There are exactly four hundred and eighty cadets at the Stratton School : five companies of two platoons each , each platoon made of four squads of twelve boys . The first two companies form the junior school  --  kids from sixth through eighth grade . The remaining three companies are the high school . You get into the high school by joining in the sixth grade and working your way up , as I did , or by entering at ninth grade and learning fast . Jim Barnes , who was in ninth grade like me , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning fast . <p> Through the open doorway of our barracks we watched the rain fall , cold puddles collecting in the low places of the macadam . We could hear the rain running down the gutters of the building . And we could hear something else : deep booming with a concussion , like artillery fire . <p> We were pretty small for soldiers , lined up against the wall of the corridor in over-long raincoats like real people cut off at the knees . They had us at attention in the " brace " position , with the back of our necks flat against the cinder blocks and chins pushed down into wrinkles as far as they would go . You were supposed to have a wrinkle for every year of age , and the experienced kids , like me , had even more than that . <p> All of us stared straight forward ; all of us pressed hard to hold the wrinkles . We stood as rigidly as possible because Lieutenant DiPosti was shouting at us from the opposite side of the narrow corridor , and because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing to Barnes . <p> " Boom ! " We could hear it and we could feel it , too , just like artillery . " Boom . Boom . " <p> They were explaining to Barnes the importance of folding the loose end of the raincoat belt precisely at a forty-five degree angle , and the exact tuck required to keep it from dangling . They were explaining with their hands gripping fistfuls of his uniform . They were explaining by banging his back against the cinder-block wall . <p> Barnes was a fuck-up . He had gotten things explained to him before . They had explained to him about being late for formation . They had explained about walking around with your hands in your pockets . They had explained about not loosening the uniform tie during study hall . <p> Barnes did n't like the Stratton School . He wrote home to his mother and told her about the explanations . He told her he wanted to go home . The officers knew about this because Barnes wrote during the required letter-writing period on Sunday nights . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the period and because , in Barnes 's case , they opened the envelope and read what he had written . We knew because they lined us up the next morning and read it to us : slowly , and with feeling . <p> I watched Barnes that morning . He did n't make any faces . He just stood there , even when they got to the " please kiss Gramma and Grampa " part . Sickening . We got a good laugh out of that . We started calling him Gramma Barnes . That night , after study hall , Tom Oxford  --  my roommate , we call him the Ox  --  swiped the picture of Barnes 's mother from the pocket of his desk blotter and put it in the urinal . We all took tums pissing on it . By the time Barnes got to it , the photo was pretty limp . He picked it up with his bare fingers and washed it in the sink . Disgusting . He dried it out between a couple of paper towels and put it back in his wallet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his room and got in bed . We all looked in on him before lights out , just to say " nightie night " to his mom . We could see him lying there , red-faced against the sheets . I was starting to think he had no self-respect at all , that he was just gon na sit there and take it . But in the morning , when the lights came back on , he was gone . <p> Barnes was too much of a fuck-up to be gone for very long . The Stratton School is backed against the wall of mountains that cut the northern half of the state off from the south . The Susquehanna River slices through that wall , and all the roads and train tracks follow it . That 's how they knew where to look for Barnes and why , less than a day later , they were able to bring him back . <p> They did n't like Barnes before he ran away . The night after he got caught , they took him up to the library and gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a court martial . They strip your rank ( Barnes did n't have any ) , cut off your weekend passes , give you extra duty , call you a bunch of names , and write nasty things in your record . It 's all very official . After the general order they turned out the lights in the library and the adult officers left . In the interest of athletic competition , a few of the upperclassmen took Barnes to the gym for a workout . <p> The day after the general order I was in my room , rolling my laundry , and I saw Barnes limp past the doorway . <p> What a fuck-up , I thought . When you 're on general order , you 're also on room confinement . You do n't step out of your room even to pee without a signed order from an officer . But there was Barnes , sneaking down the hallway , thinking he would n't get caught . And my first reaction , of course , was that I should report him myself . They could be testing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out there . <p> So I was rolling my laundry , minding my own business . It 's not that hard to figure out the system at the school . You 've got the top of your dresser , there 's a hairbrush there with no pieces of hair left in it . That 's on the right , an inch and a half from the dresser edge . Next to that is your comb , clean . Then comes your plastic soap dish , with the soap dried out by toilet paper after every use . Then you 've got your toothpaste , with the tube rolled tight , and last is your toothbrush , bristles up . None of this is hard to do . <p> In the top drawer of your dresser are your socks , paired and balled . They 're all regulation black , so it 's not too tough to make a match . To the left of them is your underwear , rolled into tight little sausages . In the second drawer you 've got your fatigue shirts and sports uniform . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawer is left open for inspection a bit farther than the one above , like steps . Then you 've got your closet  --  standing metal with no door  --  and your pressed uniforms arranged by length . The shoes are lined up at the foot of the bed , spit-shined toes pointed outward . <p> That 's the way they want it . Everything in its place . And the place for Barnes right then was not to be tiptoeing toward the head without a pass . I looked in the hallway to see if anyone was watching . All I saw were empty doorways and Barnes , looking back at me , scared . I was ready to scream bloody murder , but then I thought , This guy 's a runner . I did n't want to be paired up with him , even to turn him in . I stabbed my arm in the direction of his room , looking as furious as I could . I figured that would cover me if it was a test . He looked at me a long minute to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he went on . <p> What an asshole , I thought to myself . <p> A couple of minutes later Barnes came back . <p> " Thanks , " he whispered as he went by my door . <p> " Get fucked , " I told him . We do n't like runners . A little pee gets on his mother 's picture so he runs away . What 's a guy like that gon na do when the bullets start flying ? The marines at Tarawa waded seven hundred yards through shoulder-deep water under constant machine-gun fire . You do n't want a runner covering your flank when that happens . <p> The next time I even talked to Barnes was a few weeks later during King of the Hill . Every other Friday , C Company meets down at the football field for aggressiveness training . We play games . The field is cut into the mountain slope on one side , leaving an embankment about twenty feet high . Lieutenant DiPosti explained the rules . <p> " You fucks in First Platoon are at the top of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom of the bank . You get half an hour . Whichever platoon owns the bank at the end of half an hour gets Saturday off . " <p> I 'm in Second Platoon . We all run up the bank , slipping in the dirt and clawing for the top . The first guys up start duking it out with First Platoon . I 'm smaller than the upperclassmen , but I can figure this out . The object is to do as much damage as possible without getting damaged yourself . At the top of the bank ! grab somebody 's leg . He kicks me in the chest . I twist the foot and he goes down , falling backwards over the bank . I have just enough time to stand up when somebody grabs my shirt from behind and sends me after him . <p> The next ten minutes go like that . I get up , run up the hill , twist a foot or two , and get tossed down myself . I 'm too small to just take a swing at somebody . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the action from below . You have to keep moving . Somebody kicks me in the back . ! crawl forward , lunge at another foot , and get kicked in the mouth . I let go and reach up . Not too bad . A little blood is good for you here . DiPosti looks for that kind of thing . I go after another leg , near the edge of the crowd . I grab on and twist , but nothing happens . I look up and see Barnes looking down at me . He 's calm  --  like there are n't a hundred guys fighting around him  --  and he says , " You 're bleeding . " <p> " You 're goin ' down , " I tell him , twisting the foot . <p> " Come off it , " he says , shaking me loose . " We 're in the same platoon ! " <p> Barnes is pretty big for a ninth grader and he looms over me while I grab for his ankle again . For a split second he 's got a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he misses it . I twist the ankle , throw a shoulder behind his knees , and he goes face forward down the bank . I can feel DiPosti watching . I do n't care if he is in my platoon , Barnes is on general order . He 's worth extra points . <p> I took it easy on Barnes compared to most of them . That 's partly because he was bigger than me , and partly because I knew the system and I did n't do anything that was n't going to get me something in return . Beating up Barnes in private just did n't do me any good , but there were a lot of people who seemed to find it very worthwhile . <p> When you 're on general order you try to avoid being alone with a group of cadets . Suddenly the system becomes your friend . They ca n't come in your room after dark because it 's a curfew violation . They ca n't break formation to get you , so you 're okay there . If two or more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an attack of conscience . In class you 're okay , in meals you 're okay , in chapel you 're okay . You 've got to watch any time when the rules get suspended . Gym , the locker room , to and from class , nighttime before lights out , mornings in the shower . That 's when they got Barnes . <p> You do n't break any bones , you do n't leave any unexplained cuts or bruises . A black eye , well , you could explain that . He fell . He bumped into my elbow . It was the same with scratches . You could say he was shaving . Playing football . Some of the things you did did n't leave any marks . Hold his head under water in the toilet . Or pushups  --  down for fifty , down for a hundred , down for a hundred and fifty thousand . <p> We had regular activities at the school , but always with a twist . We buried a time capsule like other classes do , but ours was a green ammunition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with rifles held over their heads . If the football team got beat , we got extra duty on Saturday to encourage school spirit . " Health " class , for some reason , included military training . We learned the four food groups and the proper method for throwing hand grenades in the same period . <p> Winter activities were no different . We threw snowballs by platoons : two squads up the middle , one squad trying the right flank , one held in reserve . During the first big snow of December , First Platoon was defending the slope in front of the library . They had a low wall for a snow fort . ! was in the flanking squad of Second Platoon . People were throwing snowballs like they meant it . You got hit and you went down , hard . I saw a guy get it in the open eye , the snow packed into the socket . He zigzagged out of the action . Sharpshooters climbed trees . Logistics groups handed up snowballs to them . Firepower is key to any military engagement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we could . The air was full of flying snowballs . <p> Our attack on the flank just fell apart and I was trying to get out of there with my skin when three of our guys tackled Barnes and threw him over the wall to the enemy . There was a lot of eager yelling on the other side , and then everything just stopped . The whole slope got quiet and both platoons stood around to see what would happen to Barnes . <p> This is the only place I 've ever been where the snowball fights have executions . They tied Barnes 's hands , lined him up against the library wall , and let him have it from a row of eight upperclassmen . It was all very organized . DiPosti went across to call out the positions : " Ready , aim ... " They all aimed for his face . Barnes lasted three volleys before he started crying . He sank to his knees in the snow . The wall behind him was freckled with white impacts . A couple of the guys walked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby , " somebody said . <p> I do n't know . An execution is one thing . But I guess they did n't have to kick snow on him . Standing around after everybody left I was thinking , They did n't tie your feet , asshole . I mean if he 's the kind of guy that runs , why did n't he just run ? Sure , he 's gon na get caught , but you got eight snowballs coming at your eyelids , what are they gon na do to you that 's worse than that ? I could n't figure it out . I thought , Well , maybe he 's just stupid . And then I realized I 'd waited around too long because Barnes looked up at me standing there and said , " Untie me , will you ? " <p> A couple of days after the snowball fight it was the end of fall quarter . I knew already from DiPosti that I got a promotion . Acting sergeant : two dark blue stripes on the sleeve , four inches down from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the dining room to check out my grades . Barnes was down there looking up at the roster . I stood back and let him move out of the way . <p> " How 'd you do ? " he asked me from the side of the board . <p> I just looked at him . He still had a black eye from the snowball fight . <p> " I see you got promoted . " <p> " Yeah , " I said . <p> " They 're not promoting me these days . " <p> " That 's because you 're a stupid fuck . " <p> " Yeah , well , maybe . " <p> " Definitely . " <p> " Okay , sure . " He had a mean shiner . The left eye was swollen up and bulging like it was going to pop . He looked like half man , half fish . <p> " Nice eye , " I said . <p> " I had an accident . I bumped into something . " <p> " Yeah ? What ? " " First Platoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You got ta stay with your squad . " <p> He shut up for a second , then he said , " Listen , does this place ever seem strange to you ? " <p> I knew what he was getting at . I looked straight in his face . I stood right up to him , human to fish . <p> " No , man , " I said . " I think this place is heaven on earth . " <p> " Oh , " he said . He sounded disappointed . When the door shut behind him , I breathed out  --  one long breath  --  and shook my head . If he could n't cut it , let him wise up . No way was I getting dragged into his problems . I looked up at the board again . Not bad . I got an A in health . Couple of C 's . I ran my finger down the rows of names , looking at the other scores . The type was pretty small and I could n't see at first . Then I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in disbelief . <p> It said Barnes , first in the class . I stood there with my mouth open . " Shit , " I said . " So much for stupid . " <p> Barnes left again at the end of January . We heard about it at calisthenics formation , six A.M. It was still dark . It was really cold . A couple of snow flurries swirled in the air . <p> " Too cold to snow right , " the Ox said as we dressed up the squad . DiPosti was talking to the company commander , his back to us , hands slapping his biceps . We could see the steam from his breath rising over his head . The battalion commander called attention from the platform by the dining hall . They did the roll call : " A Company all present and accounted FOR , " shot the first company commander . " B Company all present and accounted FOR , " said the next . " C Company , one man missing , " said our guy . It sounded strange . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out when he said it . The final two company commanders finished their reports . A murmur ran down the long rows of the formation . <p> " At ease , " snapped DiPosti to our platoon . We shut up , but you could see everybody looking up and down the columns . We marched into the dining hall after exercise , scanning the blank spot in the formation and then DiPosti 's back . Man , was that guy pissed . <p> We had three good days of rumors before we heard anything new about Barnes . They looked in the town . They sent a couple of squads of seniors down to the river . The adult officers searched the road in their cars . By the afternoon of the first day , they called the police . <p> " Stupid fuck could have picked a better time to split , " said the Ox on the second morning , slapping his gloved hands together . <p> Barnes had no money and no civilian clothes . The school kept it like that for all of us . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where do you sleep out there at the end of January ? <p> I ran it all over in my mind . He had to sneak past his roommate , out of his room , down the corridor of the dorm , past all the open doors ( they keep the doors open at night ) , out of the building , over the wall , through the town , down the road  --  something like fifteen miles  --  to the river , down the highway to Harrisburg , through Harrisburg , and then a long run of seventy miles to New Jersey . That 's if he was going home . All the time he had to be freezing his butt off and scared to hitchhike because that 's the way the officers usually picked you up . <p> " He 's dead , " I told the guys in our group . " No way he could make that . " <p> " He 's dead if they catch him , " said the Ox . <p> " He 's dead , anyway . " <p> They never actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rumor mill . His mother called . He made it all the way home . He told his parents about the general order , about room confinement , and the beatings , and how he missed them , and how he wanted to come home , and then they sent him back . It was his stepfather 's idea . <p> His stepfather drove him up to the administration building at the end of the week . He had a long meeting with the school superintendent while Barnes sat in the hallway in civilian clothes . The cadet officer of the day was DiPosti . He stood over Barnes at parade rest , his leather Sam Browne belt crossing his chest . DiPosti was smiling . <p> Barnes got a double general order . They lined us all up in the building and we could hear the artillery booming again , the wall shaking with it . DiPosti assigned two cadets to be with Barnes all the time . If he was going to class , two cadets walked him to the building . If he was due at formation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . If he was going to pee , they went with him fight into the latrine . <p> The escorts knew where Barnes was all the time . So it was easy for DiPosti and the upperclassmen to find Barnes walking past the athletic fields on the way to the barracks . It was easy to get him alone in his room between classes . There was no problem catching him in the latrine with only a few other guys . Usually the escorts held him . <p> They had the escorts on rotating duty , and when the Ox and I were up we had to walk all over campus with Barnes . We were on our way to the library when he got the urge to talk . <p> " What 's up at four o'clock ? " he asked me . <p> " We 're supposed to take you to the soccer field . " <p> " What for ? " <p> " Soccer practice . " <p> " In February ? " <p> " Maybe they 're starting early , " said the Ox . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my chest . I stopped . I looked at his hand and then at his face . He took the hand away . <p> " You know what they 're going to do to me down there . " <p> " That 's not my problem . " <p> " Keep moving , asshole , " said the Ox . <p> We took him to the library . His hands were shaking while he looked something up . We could see the individual pages vibrating . I wanted to just hold his hands for a minute to stop the shaking . Just so he could read better . But then I looked at Ox standing over him , hands on his hips , and I thought to myself , How could a guy like this be number one in his class ? I looked over to see what he was reading . We had to watch him because he was n't allowed to see any maps . He had some book about the Civil War . They had a lot of good war books in there . <p> " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I fingered the page . <p> " It 's okay . " <p> " You know why they fought it ? " <p> " South shelled Fort Sumpter . " <p> " They fought it because of slavery . " <p> " So ? " <p> " You know what slavery is ? " <p> " Do I care ? " <p> " It 's when somebody else controls every minute of your life and they make you do things you do n't want to do and they keep you away from your family . " <p> " Fuck you . " <p> " Think about it . " <p> That bastard . We took him to soccer practice . DiPosti was the winter coach . <p> I guess Barnes never liked soccer because he made another break for it a couple of mornings later . He never had a chance . We were standing around on the macadam just before six . It was still dark outside . People were coming out of the dorms , rubbing their eyes . I was talking to the Ox when one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barnes , with no coat , his shirttail flapping behind him . He jumped out of the fire door , slammed it shut , and ran over the parking lot away from formation . <p> In a couple of seconds , the fire door banged open again . Four guys ran out . DiPosti was with them . <p> " Shit ! " I said . <p> Almost everybody was out for calisthenics . They all got quiet and watched Barnes . He ran past the gym toward the tennis courts . He had about a fifty-yard lead . <p> " No way , " somebody said . <p> " He 's fucked , " I told the Ox . <p> Barnes jumped onto the fence around the tennis courts . DiPosti 's group was gaining fast . Barnes 's feet slipped on the chain links , then he got a toehold and pulled himself up . DiPosti was already past the gym . Barnes got stuck at the top . His shirt ripped , and he fell over onto the court . DiPosti was already at the other side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ox . " DiPosti 's gon na kill him . " <p> Barnes got up and ran across the tennis court . It was icy and he slipped . He got up . He slipped and fell . DiPosti cleared the fence . Barnes was crawling across the ice . DiPosti stepped carefully . He knew we were all watching . Barnes got to his feet again . There was no fence on the mountain side of the courts . He ran over a patch of snow and up into the woods . DiPosti was right after him . The rest of the group was only a few steps behind . About a dozen guys from formation ran after them , too . <p> " Why do n't they send the whole battalion ? " I said . <p> Ox looked at me . " Say what ? " <p> " I said they do n't need to send the whole damn battalion after one guy , that 's all . " <p> Ox stepped back a little and turned his head . <p> It only took five minutes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bring him down from the mountain . He did n't look good . He " fell " again up in the woods . They took him to the administration building . He was coughing , and they carried him part of the way . <p> The Stratton School does n't have a triple general order . You get two chances . They waited a couple of days till he looked better , then called his parents . The school made a big point of throwing him out . They put notices all over the place , but hell , everybody knew he was trying to get out all along . <p> Barnes 's stepfather picked him up over the weekend . A couple of us watched from the quad . Barnes came out in a red jacket and pants . They would n't let him wear his uniform . He walked down to the car , the engine started , and they drove right out the front gate and down the hill toward town . <p> " He got what he wanted , " I said to the Ox . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yeah , " I said , " but he got what he wanted . " Ox rubbed his head from the scratchy wool of the overseas cap , but I kept looking out the driveway where it passed through the stone wall . It was cold that morning and it took a long time for the exhaust from Barnes 's car to rise in the winter air . <p> <p> By George Cruys <p> George Cruys 's stories have appeared in TriQuarterly , Epoch , and Transfer .
