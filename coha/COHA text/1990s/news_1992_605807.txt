<p> It 's business as usual in the Maine state prison system these days  --  too many inmates , no money for new cells , no money for programs . Were Larry Richardson still there , he 'd recognize it all too well . <p> Richardson was serving eight years for child molestation at the Maine State Prison when his body was found against the bars of his cell , hanging by a twisted sheet . He had been tortured for four nights by his cellmate , who pounded out one of his teeth against a toilet bowl and kicked him in the groin until the bruises reached from Richardson 's thighs to his waistline . <p> Prisoners up and down a dark corridor orchestrated Richardson 's punishment , but although they shouted and sang and acted out a kangaroo court at the top of their lungs , the guards insist they heard nothing , according to police interviews , court records and prison reports . <p> The Maine correctional system still reverberates from what inmates termed their weekend-long " party " in March 1990 . The state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ April ; last month , it settled a civil suit filed by Richardson 's mother for $ 400,000 . <p> Attorney General William P. Barr last month said the Justice Department would try to aid states that want to get out from under court-ordered caps on inmate populations , saying some orders " have wreaked havoc with states ' efforts to get criminals off the street . " But to Maine officials , Richardson 's death stands as a grisly testament to the dangers of pushing prisons past their limits . <p> Other states have their own reminders . Pennsylvania 's is the charred ruins at a prison outside Harrisburg that was designed for 1,800 inmates but packed with 2,600 . Nearly 400 inmates set it ablaze during a two-night rampage in 1989 that left 146 people injured . <p> New Hampshire 's is the August burial of two inmates slain in a maximum-security unit that was meant for 93 prisoners but held 160 . <p> On Richardson 's corridor , the Maine State Prison 's most volatile inmates were doubled up in 6-by-7-foot cells  --  the size of a walk-in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour break to shower and walk the corridor . Prison officials typically go to great lengths not to double-cell inmates in segregation wings like Richardson 's , because the units are meant to isolate troublesome inmates . " But our system was jammed to the rafters and we did n't have any place else to put them , " said Maine Correctional Commissioner Donald Allen . <p> Maine stopped double-celling the unit after Richardson 's killing , but only by shipping some inmates to a different crowded prison . <p> Like about 22 other states , Maine continues to operate its prisons well above capacity , locking up 44 percent more inmates than the institutions were designed to hold . The latest survey in January 1991 found only eight states more desperate for space . " We have no elbow room and no activities , " Allen said . " Anybody who works in corrections will tell you that 's a recipe for a . . . disaster . " <p> Maine boosted its corrections budget by an average of 9 percent during the past two years , but voters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rejected prison construction bonds three years in a row . Nationally , state corrections budgets grew an average of 12 percent during the past two years , making prisons the second-fastest growing segment of state spending after Medicaid . This year the growth in state corrections spending is expected to slow to 8 percent . <p> Barr said last month that not every state can operate its prisons far above capacity levels , but he reversed a policy under which the Justice Department had argued for court orders to cap inmate populations , saying " many courts went beyond what the Constitution required . " <p> Instead , Barr said , the department would be sympathetic to states seeking to lift population caps . Court orders now limit the inmate populations at one or more prisons in 33 states . Barr 's offer brought him at least one early taker . Officials from Texas met with Justice Department lawyers earlier this month to discuss the chances of ending a seven-year-old consent decree governing that state 's entire prison population . <p> The day after Barr gave states hope that the department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Court made it easier for state and local officials to challenge such court orders . The justices said a federal judge in Massachusetts applied too strict a standard in refusing to lift a 10-year-old prohibition against double-celling in a local jail . <p> Barr cited the federal prison system as an example to states , noting it operated at 166 percent of capacity last year and yet is free of court orders or consent decrees . " If states could operate at the level of the federal prison system , that would mean an additional 286,000 inmate beds , " Barr said . <p> To some state prison officials and activists , though , the federal system is a poor comparison because it has more programs and better-trained guards than many state systems . For example , 22 percent of federal inmates make goods for sale to the federal government in a prison industries program , while similar programs reach only 7 percent of state inmates . <p> Federal prison officials also have the advantage of size : If they need to transfer an inmate such as Richardson , they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small state like Maine has only one or two . <p> " Federal prisons are well-funded and well-programmed , " said Allen . " We 're underfunded and have too much idleness . . . . We do n't have the flexibility to move people or to keep them occupied . " <p> " The state ca n't afford these programs and they do n't do it , " said Mark Lopez , a National Prison Project attorney who has twice sued the state of Maine over prison conditions . " The federal system is infinitely better funded and more professional . " <p> According to inmates ' accounts , Richardson 's torture became a source of entertainment in the Maine State Prison 's segregation unit , where even television and radios are denied as a disciplinary measure . One inmate described the nightly drama as " suspenseful . . . like a movie . " Thomas J. Connolly , a Portland attorney who represents an inmate charged with Richardson 's killing , said , " It was a form of passing the time . " <p> As a child molester @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Richardson ranked at the very bottom of the inmate hierarchy . He became an instant lightning rod for the hostility pent up in the aged , red-brick prison on Maine 's craggy coast . <p> A slight man of 31 , Richardson entered the prison in late 1989  --  frightened , submissive and " at risk for abuse and exploitation and self-injurious behavior , " a psychological report said . He attempted suicide , was deemed unable to adjust , and finally transferred to the segregation unit to share a cell with Roger Smith . <p> Smith , 21 , and 202 pounds , was serving three years for assaulting his retarded girlfriend with a hammer . His psychological report warned he could become aggressive if frustrated , and he was quickly irritated with his new cellmate . <p> He shouted out to the 16 other inmates on the corridor : " We got us another skinner in here . We 're going to party tonight . " <p> The inmates could not see one another , but they could communicate by yelling through the small windows in the solid steel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prosecutor , judge and jury in what they called " the court of the north side . " <p> They demanded that Richardson describe his crimes , then beg for beatings and cups of his cellmate 's urine to drink , among other punishments . Smith 's kicks to Richardson 's groin ruptured one of Richardson 's testicles ; deep grooves in the porcelain of the toilet marked where Smith smashed out Richardson 's tooth . <p> Prisoners told police they kept up a steady clamor , hollering " pound him . . . . Give him one for me . " They joined to sing a " skinner " song about the abuse of a young girl . <p> Inmates in the next corridor told investigators they heard the commotion through the weekend , but the two guards on duty each night reported no unusual noises . " There is no possible way the guards could n't hear all this , " one inmate told police . <p> On Richardson 's last night , Smith told a nurse on a " pill run " that Richardson had blackened his eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smith also showed the nurse his own bruised knuckles . But the nurse testified she did not examine Richardson or question him at any length because " if you stopped and examined every complaint . . . you would never be able to deliver your medication on time . " <p> The inmates urged Richardson to hang himself and advised Smith how to help . Smith said Richardson was " scared " and " did n't want to do it , " but eventually tied his sheet to the bars . Smith kicked Richardson 's legs out from under him . <p> Smith was sentenced in November to 70 years for Richardson 's killing . A second inmate , Randall Tenggren , is scheduled to be tried for murder in April . Tenggren was eight cells down from Richardson , but he mailed Richardson 's tooth to the warden with a note that read : " This is what happens to " child molesters . <p> Despite questions about the guards ' behavior , state police and prison investigators did not interview the guards for at least 1 1/2 years after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written statements . One guard on duty when Richardson died wrote two lines , saying he " saw or heard nothing . " <p> The state attorney general 's office has now begun an investigation that may lead to disciplinary action against some guards , but the inquiry appears to provide small comfort to Maine Superior Court Judge Margaret J. Kravchuk , who presided over Smith 's trial . At one sentencing last year , Kravchuk cited the revelations in Smith 's trial and announced from the bench : " I . . . do n't have much faith in warehousing people at the Maine State Prison . " <p> Tom Connolly , Tenggren 's defense attorney , wants to put the state 's whole prison system on trial in April . " The only difference between this and what happens all the time is the poor guy died , " he said .
