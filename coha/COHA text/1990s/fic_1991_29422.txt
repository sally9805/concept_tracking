Chapter One They had been married for thirty-one years , and the following spring , full of resolve and a measure of hope , he would marry again . But that day , on a late afternoon near the end of March , Mr. Alejandro Stern had returned home and , with his attache case and garment bag still in hand , called out somewhat absently from the front entry for Clara , his wife . He was fifty-six years old , stout and bald , and never particularly good-looking , and he found himself in a mood of intense preoccupation . For two days he had been in Chicago - that city of rough souls - on behalf of his most difficult client . Dixon Hartnell was callous , self-centered , and generally scornful of his lawyers ' advice ; worst of all , representing him was a permanent engagement . Dixon was Stern 's brother-in-law , married to Silvia , his sister , Stern 's sole living immediate relation and the enduring object of his affections . For Dixon , of course , his feelings were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stem 's practice amounted to little more than the decorous hustling of clients in the hallways of the misdemeanor courts , serving Dixon 's unpredictable needs had paid Stern 's rent . Now it was one of those imponderable duties , darkly rooted in the hard soil of Stem 's own sense of filial and professional obligation . It was also steady work . The proprietor of a vast commodity-futures trading empire , a brokerage house he had named , in youth , Maison Dixon , and a series of interlocked subsidiaries , all called MD-this and - that , Dixon was routinely in trouble . Exchange officials , federal regulators , the IRS - they 'd all had Dixon 's number for years . Stern stood up for him in these scrapes . But the present order of business was of greater concern . A federal grand jury sitting here in Kindle County had been issuing subpoenas out of town to select MD clients . Word of these subpoenas , served by the usual grim-faced minions of the FBI , had been trailing back to MD for a week now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent trial , had flown at once to Chicago to meet privately with the attorneys representing two of these customers and to review the records the government required from them . The lawyers reported that the Assistant United States Attorney assigned to the matter , a young woman named Klonsky , declined to say precisely who was under suspicion , beyond exonerating the customers themselves . But to a practiced eye , this all had an ominous look . The out-of-town subpoenas reflected a contemplated effort at secrecy . The investigators knew what they were seeking and seemed intent on quietly encircling Dixon , or his companies , or someone close to him . So Stern stood travel-weary and vexed in the slate foyer of the home where Clara and he had lived for nearly two decades . And yet , what was it that wrested his attention so thoroughly , so suddenly ? The silence , he would always say . Not a tap running , a radio mumbling , not one of the household machines in operation . An isolated man , he drew , always , a certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rest or interruption . He left his bags on the black tiles and stepped smartly through the foyer . " Clara ? " he called again . He found her in the garage . When he opened the door , the odor of putrefaction overwhelmed him , a powerful high sour smell which dizzied him with the first breath and drove up sickness like a fist . The car , a black Seville , the current model , had been backed in ; the driver 's door was open . The auto 's white dome light remained on , so that in the dark garage she was wanly spotlit . From the doorway he could see her leg extended toward the concrete floor , and the hem of a bright floral shirtwaist dress . He could tell from the glint that she was wearing hosiery . Slowly , he stepped down . The heat in the garage and the smell which increased revoltingly with each step were overpowering , and in the dark his fear left him weak . When he could see her through the open door of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the camel-colored leather of the front seat . Her skin , which he noticed first , was burnished with an unnatural peachish glow , and her eyes were closed . It seemed she had meant to appear neat and composed . Her left hand , faultlessly manicured , was placed almost ceremonially across her abdomen , and the flesh had swollen slightly beneath her wedding rings . She had brought nothing with her . No jacket . No purse . And she had not fallen back completely ; her other arm was rigidly extended toward the wheel , and her head was pinned against the seat at a hopeless , impossible angle . Her mouth was open , her tongue extruded , her face dead , motionless , absolutely still . In the whitewashed laundry room adjoining the garage he was immediately sick in one of the porcelain basins , and he washed away all traces before calling in quick order 911 and then his son . " You must come straightaway , " he said to Peter . He had found him ' at home . " Straightaway . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accentuation of the persistent Hispanic traces in his speech ; the accent was always there , an enduring deficit as he thought of it , like a limp . " Something is wrong with Mother , " Peter said . Stern had mentioned nothing like that , but his son 's feeling for these things was sure . " What happened in Chicago ? " When Stern answered that she had not been with him , Peter , true to his first instincts , began to quarrel . " How could she not be with you ? I spoke to her the morning you were leaving . " A shot of terrible sympathy for himself tore through Stern . He was lost , the emotional pathways hopelessly tangled . Hours later , toward morning , as he was sitting alone beneath a single light , sipping sherry as he revisited , reparsed every solemn moment of the day , he would take in the full significance of Peter 's remark . But that eluded him now . He felt only , as ever , a deep central impatience with his son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else his heart read the first clues in what Peter had told him , and a sickening unspeakable chasm of regret began to open . " You must come now , Peter . I have no idea precisely what has occurred . I believe , Peter , that your mother is dead . " His son , a man of thirty , let forth a brief high sound , a cry full of desolation . " You believe it ? " " Please , Peter . I require your assistance . This is a terrible moment . Come ahead . You may interrogate me later . " " For Chrissake , what in the hell is happening there ? What in the hell is this ? Where are you ? " " I am home , Peter . I can not answer your questions now . Please do as I ask . I can not attend to this alone . " He hung up the phone abruptly . His hands were trembling and he leaned once more against the laundry basin . He had seemed so coldly composed only an instant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the rise . He presumed he was about to faint . He removed his tie first , then his jacket . He returned for an instant to the garage door ; but he could not push it open . If he waited , just a moment , it seemed he would understand . The house was soon full of people he did not know . The police came first , in pairs , parking their cars at haphazard angles in the drive , then the paramedics and the ambulance . Through the windows Stem saw a gaggle of his neighbors gathering on the lawn across the way . They leaned toward the house with the arrival of each vehicle and spoke among themselves , held behind the line of squad cars with their revolving beacons . Within the house , policemen roamed about with their usual regrettable arrogance . Their walkie-talkies blared with occasional eruptions of harsh static . They went in and out of the garage to gawk at the body and talked about events as if he were not there . They studied the Sterns ' rich possessions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cop into the garage had lifted his radio to summon the lieutenant as soon as he emerged . " She 's cooked , " the officer told the dispatcher . " Tell him he better come with masks and gloves . " Only then did he notice Stem lurking in a fashion in the dark hall outside the laundry room . Abashed , the policeman began at once to explain . " Looks like that car run all clay . It 's on empty now . Catalytic converter gets hotter than a barbecue six , seven hundred degrees . You run that engine twelve hours in a closed space , you 're generating real heat . That did n't do her any good . You the husband ? " He was , said Stem . " Condolences , " said the cop . " Terrible thing . " They waited . " Do you have any idea , Officer , what occurred ? " He did not know what he thought just now , except that it would be a kind of treachery to believe the worst too soon . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thick , and his weight probably made him look older than he was . " Keys in the ignition . On position . Garage door 's closed . " Stern nodded . " It dud n't look like any accident to me , " the cop said finally . " You ca n't be sure till the autopsy . You know , could be she had a heart attack or somethin right when she turned the key . " Maybe it 's one of them freak things , too , " the cop said . " Turns the car on and she 's thinkin about somethin else , you know , fixin her hair and makeup , whatever . Sometimes you never know . Did n't find a note , right ? " A note . Stern had spent the moments awaiting the various authorities here in this hallway , keeping his stupefied watch beside the door . The thought of a note , some communication , provided , against all reason , a surge of hope . " You 'd just as well stay out of there , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the instruction , but after an instant he took a single step forward . " Once more , " he said . The policeman waited only a moment before opening the door . ( Continues ... )
