Home is where you hang your hat or where you unroll your sleeping bag . // THE NIGHT WIND WAILED ACROSS the glacier . The sleeping bag-with me in it-slid nearer the edge of the crevasse . Each moment the downward tilt of the ice increased . First my ankles , then my knees inched over the edge of nothing . It was horror in slow motion . As my hips neared the brink I struggled to free the slide fastener of the bag . It was jammed tight . I could n't budge it . Reaching up the incline as far as I could , I dug my fingernails into the ice . They folded back like feathers , and I was gone , plummeting into a void as black as oblivion . But I never hit bottom . You never do in dreams . I woke up all of a sweat , both hands clutching a bedpost . " What 's the matter ? " asked my wife . " Nightmare . The sleeping bag on the glacier . " " Oh , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have never unrolled my sleeping bag on a glacier . I hope I never will . But I have slept in some strange places and lived to tell the tale . IN MY YOUTH IN ONE SUCH PLACE I made the acquaintance of an incredible hobo fisherman , a sensational character whose name was the Wizard of Odd . I met him in a boxcar-a Northern Pacific empty that I boarded on the fly one rainy night in spring in the Kansas City freight yards . This boxcar had been used recently to transport horses , and it was fragrant with essence of equine and sweet hay . Wet and shivering , I burrowed into the hay and covered myself with the dark of night . Rain drummed on the roof , while under me the wheels rumbled and clicked as the freight gathered speed . I fell into a deep sleep , and so , mercifully , lost count of the meals I had missed . Stillness , or perhaps hunger , awoke me . The rain had stopped . So had the train . My boxcar had come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhere in the Missouri Ozarks . It was early morning-and I had company . Sitting in the open doorway of the car , legs dangling over the stream , was a man of about forty . The May sunrise seemed to have set fire to his headpiece , which was a tam-o'shanter the color of pandemonium . From head to hips the stranger flared out on all sides like a huge pear . The effect was due to his unique bulging outer garment . Whether jacket , coat , or vest , its identity was lost in a galaxy of sew'em-yourself pockets . Small ones near the top graded to large and larger ones around the bottom . No two pockets were of the same material . As I STEPPED CLOSER THE MAN SMILED up at me . His round face was cleanshaven , his teeth white , his eyes a wild electric blue . " Welcome , fellow tourist , " he said and , patting the floor of the car , added , " have a chair . What 's your moniker , son ? " I told him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " I am the Wizard of Odd . " " What ? " " The Wizard of Odd . " " You mean Oz ? " " No-Odd . " " Well , what are the odds on something to eat ? " His clean , nervous hands moved like a magician 's . He made a pass over a medium-sized pocket , and his other hand faded off , then floated back toward me . The wrist rolled ; the palm opened . In the palm were two dried prunes . " REGARD EGR THESE AS A MERE stopgap , " said The Wizard . " The dining car will soon be serving . I recommend the No. 3 breakfast . " " Wizard , " I said through a prune , " do n't make jokes like that . " He smiled in understanding , and while I stared , goggle-eyed , he conjured from successive pockets a plugcasting rod in 12-inch joints , a casting reel , a red-and-white Dardevle , and a razor-edged knife . Attaching lure to line , he made an effortless cast into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a green-white fish , a flip of spray-and a walleye sailed through the boxcar door . After deftly filleting this Ozark delicacy , The Wizard did further sleight of hand among his pockets . Presently the No. 3 breakfast sizzled in a pan over a can of Sterno , first having been sprinkled with a mixture of cornmeal , flour , salt , and pepper . A tin can with a haywire bail brought coffee water from the stream . Soon after the feast , while my stomach was still applauding , my host cocked his head to one side and cupped a hand to his ear . I heard the far-off wail of a train whistle . " Pardon me , " said The Wizard , hastily repocketing his gear , " but here comes my transfer . " Before he jumped onto the oncoming train , he gave me a jaunty arm wave . That was the last of the Wizard of Odd . Where did he go ? Where is he now ? I do n't know . But I am certain I know where he came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accident , while browsing through the U.S. Postal Directory . There , in an " O " column , was the Wizard 's hometown : Odd , West Virginia ( population 300 ) . ALMOST AS STRANGE AS MY NIGHTmare about camping on a glacier was the December blizzard that Digsy Jones and I survived in a hut above timberline on New Hampshire 's Mt . Madison , a bleak and wind-roaring crag that is the northern peak of the Presidential Range in the White Mountains . Although barely 20 , we considered ourselves invincible mountain men . Employed for the summer by the Appalachian Mountain Club , we acted as guides , cooks , and packers . Twice a week we backpacked supplies up the 4-mile Valley Way Trail to the huts above timberline . We knew every train on the big , brutal peaks , and had traveled many of them at night . We loved it . And we got paid for it . We were real pros . But what was it like in winter ? We had to find out . And so the night train @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called Appalachia at 8 on the morning of December 26-a cool , windless , glass-clear day . Just across the railroad tracks the Valley Way trail led into the beech and spruce forest . We put on our snowshoes , shouldered our packs , and charged our mountain . We were lugging 30-odd pounds apiece-grub and gear for five days . The snow was trackless and deep , the going tough and slow . But about 11 o'clock we broke out above timberline a few hundred yards from Madison Huts , altitude 4,825 feet . Minutes later we pushed open the door of the stone hut where we had spent the previous summer . Our return to this once-glamorous shelter fell strangely short of expectation . In the chill interior our breath blew white . The dried-out spruce boughs in our bunks in the kitchen resembled brown skeletons . Frost furred the masonry walls . On the table a pile of blankets gave off a dank , musty smell . Our old friend , the kitchen stove , was red with rust . The stove looked very cold , especially when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the hut in September was gone to the last chip . Miscreant fall hikers had left us without a splinter . I rattled the fuel tank on the kerosene stove . Empty ! We lunched on chocolate , raisins , and pilot crackers . Spirits revived , we decided to take advantage of the wonderful weather and scale Mt . Adams . But suddenly and soberly we remembered one of camping 's basic laws : Get your camp set and your wood cut before dark . Instead of gallivanting on the mountains , we made trip after grueling trip below timberline and back to the hut with bundles of gnarled , dry spruce limbs lashed to the backs of our packs . It was dark when we made the last trip . But the main room of the hut was practically full of wood , and both water buckets brimmed with Madison spring water . The stove warmed up and the kettle began to sing . We felt invincible again . After a supper of pea soup , bacon , and flapjacks , we covered ourselves with blankets and went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead of night the wind woke us . We knew it was no ordinary wind . It seemed to haul off into the black sky , and then hit downward with a cold , brutal violence . The hut door blew open with a crash . We grabbed our flashlights and got up to close it . A blast of snow billowed around us and the cold knifed through our woolen underwear . I lit a candle , and its flame was uneasy , nervous in the prowling air drafts . A big gust slammed the hut like a clap of thunder . We heard the roof creak and shiver ; along the eaves a shower of fine snow sifted into the hut as though shot from a spray gun . We remembered that the roof of the hut was chained down , and this gave us a small comfort . A white-footed mouse came out of some secret crevice and perched on the rim of one of the water buckets . Its dark eyes were frightened . So were Digsy 's and mine . We put some raisins and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bucket , and the mouse jumped down and began nibbling . During the previous summer , we had trapped this creature 's ancestors without mercy . But now we were bound together in a common danger . Besides , if we were kind to the mouse , maybe the wind would relent . But even as we replenished the creature 's food supply the storm bombarded the hut with redoubled frenzy , as if to prove that nature knows no horse trades . This was a wind to penetrate stone . There was an outside thermometer at the southeast window of the hut . Digsy put his flashlight on it , and reported , " Two below zero . " That temperature reading was our last one . The next time Digsy looked , all you could see was a wall of snow . The drift had banked solid against the window , closing out the thermometer , and one by one other windows closed out . How much deeper could this snow get ? How much more terrible the wind ? We fed the mouse again ; the act gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What if our roof broke up around its chains , ripped to shreds by this tempest with murder in its heart ? We thought we heard shingles fluttering . Was the wind peeling them as you 'd flip the scales from a fish ? Day brought only a faint change in light . With all but one window covered by drift , the hut was like a tomb . We were trapped ; and when we realized it , panic began to play with us . Panic is your worst enemy in any emergency . If the roof chains held , we could stay in the hut-shel tered , reasonably warm , reasonably fed , indefinitely . Good sense told us that . Panic would n't listen . It kept chopping at us , keeping time with the howling of the wind . ON THE SECOND DAY OF THE BLIZzard we made our ill-starred move to break out and get down below timberline . We opened the hut door , tunneled out through the drift with our snowshoes as shovels-and in 10 seconds were exactly nowhere . " Nowhere " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , spiraling , and your eyes are frosted shut , and you do n't know which way is anywhere or up from down , and you are all but invisible , even to your own self . Twenty minutes of this would give us the long goodbye , and we knew it . Bewildered and terrified , Digsy and I groped for each other , locked arms , and plunged back through the white hole into the hut . When we got the door closed , we stood there in the roaring gloom , both of us pale and trembling . Our courage had hit an all-time low . This was the wind that would never cease , the snow that was permanent . But sometime in the night the impossible happened . We woke from fitful sleep to hear one of nature 's sweetest sounds : the stillness after the bedlam of a long , violent storm . We burrowed out into the sparkling bright morning . The world was safe again . We were down the mountain before noon . We left our mouse a supply of dried beans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long nights . I often wonder who burned the remainder of our wood supply . Reprinted from May 1965 <p>                     @x Malahide , just north of Dublin . Not so long ago . <p> Long after the house had been disinfected for new occupants and the bodies rested safely in the ground , people still did n't come near it . " Cursed , " whispered the neighborhood gossips and nodded meaningfully . " Deadly , a haunted house ! " cried the children , but they only ever mustered up the courage to take a step or two into the front yard before losing heart . <p> Because what Desmond the mailman had been the first to see inside had been unnatural strange . <p> Everybody liked Desmond , even if he might have been a little too nosy for his own good . He was also a slave to ritual , always noticing if anybody 's grass needed tending or whether the paint on a flagpole had begun to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ details without understanding their true meaning , these otherwise sociable qualities cost him his sanity . <p> On the last day of his life that gave him any joy , this most demanding connoisseur of his customers ' coffee delivered the day 's mail in the quiet neighborhood just down the street from the train station in Malahide as slowly as he decently could without being called a Peeping Tom . He started where the bars of New Street met the faux-Bavarian ugliness of the concrete marina and took a left , continuing out to Bissets Strand . As usual , old Des peered in the windows to see if anyone he knew might be waiting inside with a fresh cup , and he was n't disappointed ; he 'd drunk two before reaching the end of the first block . Most residents had come to accept his lonely need for attention . Just " happening by " for a spot of the morning java made him feel , it was understood , as if he were part of someone else 's life , just for a bit . He always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never outstayed his welcome . And he smiled when he saw you  --  that 's what made everyone surrender to this strange little creature  --  flashed a grin as wide as you please . <p> Before he found the corpses , Desmond was universally viewed as harmless . <p> His life off the clock , such as it was , was spent at the safe remove of Gibney 's , where he stole glances at the local wives when their husbands were n't looking and lost his meager paychecks at the bookmaker 's next door each time there was a hurdles horse race on TV , which was often . He had trudged his black mailbag up and down the old beach town 's cracked pavements for more than eighteen years , staring at the same ash-gray houses where the nearby sea had eaten away at the paint , and found the monotony comforting . Going in to the city , just half an hour away by train , would have required a desire for surprise and a worldliness he could n't have imagined pursuing . Besides , it would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four good cups before lunch . <p> When he walked past on the footpath , people inside their kitchens could hear him hum . Nonsense tunes , really . He had lousy pitch but bobbed his head to the beat , which counted for more than talent . He was happy the way only children under the age of twelve usually are . <p> Later , people took bets on whether that humming should have warned them . <p> It was on either the 24th or the 25th of April , just after ten in the morning , as far as anybody could recall , that the town 's tolerant opinion of Desmond changed forever . The sun did n't shine . God averted his eyes from number 1 Strand Street and , instead , sent rolling clouds draped in suicide gray in from the sea to obscure something imminent not meant for public consumption . A prophetic color choice , as it should turn out . And so Desmond Kean , waving in blissful ignorance to old Mrs. Dingle on the second floor of Howard 's Corner and tipping his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair salon , proceeded toward the end of his daily route . <p> When he had handed out mail to the drab granny houses out on Bissets Strand , turned back , and again reached number 1 , on the corner of Old Street and Gas Yard Lane , he hesitated all the same . The bag was nearly empty , and he only had to deliver two adverts from the local supermarket to Mrs. Hegarty inside . In the days to come , Desmond would go back and forth in his fevered mind , trying to remember how far back he should have noticed that something was wrong with how that house made him feel . It looked ordinary enough , its fatade a faded cream with fake Swiss wood latticework above the doorway . But from the very beginning , something just out of reach whispered a warning about the house 's occupant that he had been too polite to hear . <p> Mrs. Hegarty , who let Desmond call her " Moira " only after a year of sporadic  --  and persistent  --  visits , had come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk much about . People said it was a small town way out in West Cork . She was still a handsome woman at forty-five , and her face had the lucky kind of defined bone structure that would wear well into old age . On the rare occasions when Desmond 's clumsy jokes managed to coax a smile , she was beautiful . But she had also acquired a hardness to her that blossomed into open hostility whenever people tried to get too friendly . Invitations to tea from neighbors were first met with polite refusals . And when some tried bringing her cakes to drive the point home , she left them untouched on her front porch , where wild cats finally ate them . <p> Among the many curious neighbors , only Desmond was ever invited into the house for coffee , probably because of his innocence or willful blindness to people 's hidden side . Then , sometime last January , Mrs. Hegarty had abruptly stopped answering the door when he rang the bell . His subsequent attempts to reconnect with her whenever they happened on each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rarely seen outside her four walls as it was , would simply trail past him without a word in that old greatcoat , a scarf wrapped around her head like a mummy . She never again asked him inside . Desmond and everyone else simply assumed she 'd had a tragedy befall her , did n't pry , and gave her the space she obviously craved . <p> And yet . <p> Now that Desmond stood outside Mrs. Hegarty 's front door with the colorful adverts in his hand , he hesitated because of that feeling he 'd had these last few weeks whenever he walked past . Recently , there had been sounds from inside that Desmond had written off as coming from a TV set , or maybe the radio . They had sounded like whimpers , even the cries of a young voice . Once there had been a loud thumping noise , and the drapes on the second floor had been yanked open briefly before being shut once again . But since Desmond was only curious , not investigative or even brave , he explained it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which he himself belonged . <p> The closer he came to the mail slot , the more the little hairs on his hand stood to attention like a blond forest . He thought he smelled something . Like spoilt stew . He was n't sure where it was coming from ; could have been seaweed rotting on the beach nearby . Or someone 's fridge where the power had gone out . But he knew it was n't . <p> Desmond finally ignored his imprecise feeling of foreboding , bent down , and pushed open the slot . He jammed one of the Tesco adverts inside . He noticed a pile of unopened mail on the floor . <p> And then he stopped . <p> Far inside , near where he knew Mrs. Hegarty 's sitting room was , he saw what was probably a hand . <p> It was blue-black , ballooned thick like a surgical glove , and stuck out from somewhere in the adjoining room . The arm connected to it was fat and sausagelike , too , as if filled with water . A watch lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrist from the swelling . Desmond craned his neck and could just glimpse some more of Mrs. Hegarty 's remains , dark stains all over her Sunday best . He could have sworn that , despite all that , she was smiling . Des just avoided getting sick all over his shoes and ran down to tell the gardaf . <p> And for the first and last time in his life , he left a piece of mail undelivered . <p> AFTER THE REGULAR guards from up the street forced the lock open , they stepped aside and made room for the astronaut-looking forensics team from Garda headquarters in Phoenix Park . Two men silently entered , backed up by a canine unit . The dogs howled and whimpered as the crusted blood called out to them , and their handlers had to hold them back . One astronaut wearing a white full-body HazMat suit knelt by Moira 's prostrate body and examined her skull . There were several depressions in it just above one eye , as if someone had struck her over and over with a blunt object , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death was later determined at the inquest to have been caused by a massive subdural hematoma . In other words , Moira Hegarty had suffered a stroke after being beaten and died only minutes afterward . The body had been lying there for at least three days . One detective superintendent initially thought it was a robbery-homicide . Once he learned the full story , however , he was later heard to remark under his breath that " that fucking bitch deserved every blow she got . " Because her death , as far as the cops were interested , was the least of it . <p> There were scuff marks on most of the walls , too , as if more than one person had tumbled around the ground floor , trying to gain control of the other . Shoe polish and brown leather skid marks had been smeared on the floor panels , and paintings of the Holy Land were askew . Those signs of struggle were replicated in every room downstairs , and it made the rookies nervous . One local garda opened the press under the sink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a necklace on Moira that was forged in iron and welded shut at the nape . A smaller ring with more than ten different keys was connected to it . Any one of them would have been impossible to pry off . " Must have jangled when she took a shower , " another remarked , in a poor attempt at dispelling the unease they all felt . Once removed with bolt cutters , the keys were found to fit every lock in the house  --  from the outside . They found no other keys . And most of the doors were locked shut . <p> Forensic analysis indicated that Mrs. Hegarty suffered the injuries upstairs , then managed to make it almost down to her couch , collapsing just inches away . A fine blood trail from upstairs pointed the way . <p> The cops stopped laughing when they walked up to the second floor to verify this theory . It took two of Malahide 's finest to shove the door open . One caught the nervous look of his partner when they put their shoulders into it . Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near Mrs. Hegarty . They were n't ashamed to have an armed officer accompany them as they revealed the truth of what Desmond saw and yet had missed so completely . <p> The girl lay bunched up against the door , her hands folded around a rusty shovel as if in prayer . <p> " Jesus ! " exclaimed the youngest garda , and steadied himself on the doorjamb . Downstairs , the dogs howled , and their claws clicked around on the wooden floor . <p> Her red hair had been turned nearly black by sweat and filth . The fingers , slender and elegant , had only two nails left on them , and her ribs showed through the thin film of what once had to have been a yellow summer dress . Poor thing had died hard , the Garda established , but they could n't immediately determine whether it was the knife wounds in her abdomen or something internal that killed her first . The shovel had her fingerprints on it , however , and its head matched the marks on Mrs. Hegarty 's forehead . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the stairs before something had broken off that chase . A knife was recovered from behind a chair , and Mrs. Hegarty 's prints made it clear that she had stabbed the young woman not twice but at least nineteen times . <p> " Poor child bled out quick , " a veteran cop remarked , blowing his nose . <p> Forensics quickly reconstructed the scene . A desperate battle had taken place on the second floor , where Mrs. Hegarty had tried to beat back the weakened girl 's surprise attack and ultimately succeeded . But the young woman had n't surrendered without a fight . Almost as an afterthought , forensics realized that not only did Mrs. Hegarty 's keys fit in all the locks , but no room in the house had a keyhole on the inside . Remains of raw potatoes and moldy bread were found under the bed , where the girl had clearly been forced to save her rationed , meager food . It was determined that she 'd lived inside the house for at least three months . Leg irons and handcuffs were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well used . The smallest of the self-established prison warden 's keys fit snugly in them . Poor divil had cuff burns where the metal had eaten into her skin . Two bent hairpins , caked brown by the girl 's own blood on the floorboards , were determined to be her homemade handcuff keys . <p> She had been a prisoner . For a long time . There was no other conclusion . <p> And the warden , the kindly woman doling out coffee to Desmond , had never been found out until it was too late . <p> " We had no idea , " said the out-of-breath gentleman from Social Services , blinking in the camera lights right behind the cops , when confronted with the queasy notion that Mrs. Hegarty , the shut-in from somewhere out west , had evidently kept a live-in slave right under the noses of her neighbors . " We shall immediately make further enquiries . " But as the man avoided the stares of angry onlookers and exited the house by the front steps , everyone knew that was so much bullshit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the street was an unmitigated monster . And nobody had cared enough to notice , least of all the government . <p> Through all this , while the astronauts , the flatfoot cops from around the corner , and the dogs all dissected their part of the unfolding mystery , Desmond knew that to be true more than anybody else . From the time the first ambulance came to carry that poor girl away , he stood right across the street , clutching a railing for balance , staring at number 1 's chocolate-colored front door . And when darkness came , he still had n't moved . An unhappy , ghostly smile had replaced the genial one he usually wore . And slowly , the same people who had tolerated Desmond 's fussy demeanor now began looking askance at the prematurely balding man trying to catch a glimpse of the young girl 's battered corpse being loaded into the ambulance . Those furtive glances into their kitchens took on a completely new and unsettling meaning . And it felt so good , besides , to smear one 's collective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " a mother was heard to remark , cracked lipstick forming the words . " Sick bastard , " added another . Both had served him coffee with a smile days earlier . <p> But even if his untoward glances could have been taken for untimely curiosity , or even sexual titillation , they were wrong . Had they been able to look into Desmond 's heart , they would have discovered nothing but the blackest , stickiest guilt and shame . Those thumping noises now made sense to him . The yelps coming from the top floor could have  --  no , definitely had  --  been cries for help mere days before a violent death . Desmond nodded meekly at the neighborhood women , who did n't meet his eyes but kept theirs fixed on the front door of number 1 , as if staring at it long enough would make them better neighbors . <p> NIGHT HAD FALLEN . The astronauts had finally folded their tents and carted the results back down to HQ . The throng of onlookers had thinned , but barely , when Desmond heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shout and a yell . Someone had been surprised , and not by anything pleasant . Within seconds , the same young garda who had found the girl appeared in the doorway , his already ashen face pulled in directions that were all wrong . What ever he 'd just seen exceeded his tolerance for human ugliness . <p> " Sarge , " he said , swallowing hard . " Something we missed before . " <p> One of the dogs had refused to move , but instead hugged the carpet and began to weep when it passed a bookcase on the second floor . Not to howl , like before , but to mourn what ever it sensed nearby . <p> When the gardaf finally moved the bookcase and opened the blinded door hidden behind it , they found the second girl . <p> " LOOKS YOUNGER THAN the first , " said the coroner later in the week , after performing proper autopsies on all three women , and he snapped his rubber gloves off with a practiced gesture that gave him no joy at all . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crawl space that was really part of the outer wall . Reached only through a door tiny enough to have suited a doll house , a narrow air duct led from the first girl 's room to her damp corner . Absent any ID , she was determined to have been in her early twenties , with black wiry hair that would have been beautiful when it was still clean enough to be brushed . Her skin , except for sores brought about by poor hygiene and lack of protein , was unblemished by blows . In contrast to the first girl , she had died of massive organ failure , brought about by gradual poisoning and malnourishment . Her arms were so thin no muscle tone remained . When they found her , she lay in a dirty blanket like a whipped dog . Like the first girl , she bore marks of having been routinely shackled . In fact , one of the officers gently unlocked a set of leg cuffs that had caused her ankles to bleed . What nobody had a satisfactory answer for was why both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found , but no paper . If she had been writing to somebody in the darkness of her prison cell , what had she done with the message ? <p> A few days went by while the guards inventoried every stick of furniture found inside the house . <p> Then , when one of Moira Hegarty 's many keys was found to unlock a dresser drawer , the story grew worse . And even the foulest gossip in Malahide was momentarily silenced at the sheer calculated ugliness of what the law dogs found . <p> The drawer first yielded two driver 's licenses . One was made out to a red-haired , well-nourished Fiona Walsh , twenty-four , of Castletownbere , County Cork ; clearly the first girl found on the top floor . The other belonged to twenty-two-year-old R=isfn Walsh , whose black locks and pale skin in the photograph bore little resemblance to the skeletal creature now lying on the metal slab next to her sister . It was unclear how and when the girls had arrived at Moira Hegarty 's house , but that 's not what moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detail that gave the Evening Herald and the Irish Daily Star golden days for far longer than the initial shock value of the news was something most had already guessed . <p> Fiona and R=isfn were n't just two sisters who had suffered a grim death . <p> Moira  --  their jailer and killer  --  was their aunt . <p> SLAVE SISTERS SLAIN BY KILLER AUNT , barked one headline . BEAUTIES AND THE BEAST BLARED another . And despite their lack of tact , both were right . The girls were found to have ingested small , steady amounts of the anticoagulant rat poison coumatetratyl over a period of at least seven weeks , probably mixed in with their water and what passed for food . " Put simply , " the coroner said , " the girls ' organs gradually fell apart , and any cuts they sustained would n't have healed . The youngest died of internal bleeding . And each would appear to have been chained to her bed at night . Their aunt really planned this one out . " The newspapers , as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diabolical , which was true enough , too . <p> But the dresser drawer still did n't offer up any clues as to why any of this had happened . <p> Among the inventoried effects were several sealed plastic bags with clumps of black dirt inside . Upon further analysis , the bags were also found to contain a button , one damask napkin , a crumpled pack of Marlboro Lights , and a used 12-gauge shotgun shell . None of these items seemed connected , but for the fact that the dirt on them had the same pH value . Some stationery was found , too , of which exactly one envelope and a sheet of expensive writing paper had been used . But forensics could n't determine for what purpose . Perhaps R=isfn had used it but , if so , the questions went , for what ? <p> After a few days , the neighborhood grew restless and less enamored of the cops ' authority . Kids dared one another to cross the white-and-blue Garda tape and grab a trophy from the wall , a stunt never repeated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become inhabited by ghosts . One boy made off with a plastic Jesus figurine with a 40-watt bulb inside it to illuminate the halo . Another managed to get as far as the corner before a garda nabbed him and made him give back a gilt-edged portrait of the once-so-revered Taoiseach Eamon de Valera , the prime minister 's long face seeming to disapprove of the dead woman who had hung him above her mantelpiece . <p> The police were rapidly running out of clues and got ready to close the case . <p> Then the house offered up one more secret all by itself . <p> It came in the form of a previously overlooked scuff mark by the back door , which looked like someone had nearly ripped it off the hinges trying to get out . A fingerprint was found on the handle that did n't match any of the three dead women 's , and theirs were the only ones otherwise discovered in the house . But a third soiled bed was found in the basement , and more of the same unknown prints were found on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw through the pipe with a primitive cutting tool and had very likely fled the house with handcuffs still attached to at least one wrist . <p> The two girls had n't been suffering alone . Someone else had been there with them , until very recently , a someone who was still out there , alive . And undiscovered . <p> When the last floorboard had been unpeeled and every spoon in the kitchen itemized without turning up anything new , number 1 Strand Street was finally cleaned out , boarded up , and offered for sale by the city . And as tantalizing as the unknown fourth person in that house might have been , with no apparent clues or even a single living relative to suggest any compelling explanation for the carnage , the gardaf quietly shuttered the case after a few months . Even the press eventually moved on to fresher kills . <p> Around the town 's bars , the case was still being tried , however . <p> " Moira was off her head , " went one popular theory . " She had it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's sake .

" What a waste , " the neighbors said , and they were right , what ever the truth . " The mystery guest was Moira 's lover , who killed them all and left before getting what was coming to him , " went one particularly fanciful notion . But none of these theories lasted any longer than the time it took to utter them . <p> " What happened here began somewhere else , " a regular down at Gibney 's finally ventured one night after a half pint of stout and a lot of listening to crap gossip from people with more alcohol in them than common sense . " This kind of bloodletting takes years of hatred to ripen properly . " <p> If the boys in blue down on the Mall could have heard him just then and put down their breakfast rolls , they might well have cracked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the half of it . Because the story the women inside Moira 's house nearly took to their graves did begin somewhere else , in a small town in West Cork where everyone was driven by something far stronger and more combustible than hate . <p> It was love that put Moira and her two nieces into the quiet section of the tiny graveyard behind St. Andrew 's Church . <p> The kind of love that burns hotter than a blast furnace . <p> AT THE SAD little funeral carried out and paid for by Social Services the following week , no relatives or friends came by to pay their last respects to the Walsh sisters and their murderous aunt . Fiona and R=isfn were placed a few feet apart from Moira , which the funeral director insisted upon , " because I 'll be damned if that awful woman should be able to reach out and touch those poor children . " As if to mock the two young girls , God had turned the coke-colored weather cape inside out and now shone bright sunlight through a misty rain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guest in attendance weep so loudly it bothered mourners at another funeral two graves over . <p> Desmond appeared to have aged ten years inside of a month . <p> From the day the two Walsh sisters and their aunt had been carted out to the meat wagon , he had n't been seen in public . That 's because the first thing he did when he came home to his freezing little flat was to take off his uniform and burn it . As days turned to weeks , the usual sounds of rare Jelly Roll Morton tunes seeping like golden pearls underneath the door from his old stereo went silent . Neighbors thought they heard quiet weeping . Children stuck their noses near his windowpane to catch a glimpse of the weirdo , and a few saw a flash of messy hair atop a pallid face . " Freak ! " they whispered to one another , threw rocks at his front door , then ran home laughing . Parents knew , of course , but allowed that bit of exorcism . Better someone other than they take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it appeared to have worked . A nice unsuspecting Polish family would eventually move into number 1 , which once again looked like just another house on the block . <p> Desmond wore a shiny black suit with worn elbows and knees , like a waiter at a ferry cafeteria . He trembled as Father Donnelly said the requisite prayer . And he had to cover his mouth with both hands when the priest got to " Blessed art Thou amongst women . " Below the church hill , the soot-colored rooftops were slick with rain . Desmond remained standing long after the graves had been properly padded and marked . He still stood there as it really began to pour . <p> When he started back for his flat and nodded at a group of kids in the street , that 's the last anyone ever saw of him . <p> If it had n't been for another postman , named Niall , whose curiosity likewise picked him out of his humdrum existence and catapulted the poor lad headlong into the biggest adventure of his short life , the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Walsh sisters was only just beginning to unfold . <p> Anybody walking near the cemetery that night might have had enough imagination to see the girls ' spirits rise from their cheap state-sponsored coffins and hover in the air near the ser vice window of the post office , tapping on the glass . For they had unfinished business inside . <p> Desmond , poor soul , had been closer than he thought . <p> And neither Fiona nor R=isfn , even in death , would be denied . <p> Excerpted from DARLING JIM by Christian Moerk <br> Copyright 2007 byChristian Moerk <br> Published in 2009 by Henry Holt and Company
