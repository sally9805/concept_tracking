MAJOR POLICY STATEMENTS PREPARED BY U.S. Catholic bishops are always worked out in a fashion that wins the final texts lopsided support . That pattern ended with a troublesome letter on women 's issues that took nine years to produce . Meeting in Washington , the bishops gave the conservative final version a paltry 55.5% support , far short of the two-thirds needed for approval . The text will now be issued as a mere committee document . <P> Chicago 's Cardinal Bernardin got through a separate motion making the paper the basis for " further study and dialogue , " most notably on the church 's opposition to women priests , which was endorsed in the rejected text . Bernardin backs the ban but said candidly that it is " generally not well understood or accepted " and that a more persuasive case must be made . Liberal lobbies hailed these developments . The upshot is that , contrary to Vatican wishes , the U.S. bishops have made women 's ordination subject to ongoing debate .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
