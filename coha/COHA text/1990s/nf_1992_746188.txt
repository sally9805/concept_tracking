This study was to determine if verbal incentive is an effective variable in the development of the control of electroderrnal fluctuations ( EDFs ) ; and if body movement and respiratory artifacts are confounding variables in the feedback control of EDFs . Nonlabiles encouraged to increase EDFs by " thinking emotional thoughts " demonstrated significant increases in both EDFs and body movement and respiratory artifacts . However , persons with few , if any , artifacts showed an almost identical pancrn of EDFs as compared to persons with relatively more artifacts in their recordings . Incentive as compared to control groups reported an increased ability to sustain their thinking about emotional events . All groups indicated decreased anxiety from pre- to post- feedback conditions . The findings were related to contemporary theory on cognition . <p> The purpose of this study was to determine if verbal incentive is an effective variable in the development of the control of electrodermal fluctuations ( EDFs ) and if body and repiratory artifacts are confounding variables of EDF analysis . <p> Interest in the electrodermal system and the control of EDFs appears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasons for this may be because of the greater apparent medical and psychological value of research related to somatomotor and cardiovascular systems , and , possibly as well , because of problems and technical concerns of measurement ( Fowles et al. , 1981 ) and in obtaining consistent results with electrodermal responses . In an early review , Shapiro ( 1977 ) noted some inconsistencies of results and also the problems of teasing out the subtleties of autonomic and somatic interactions . <p> However , even given these concerns , research on the control of the electrodermal system would seem particularly important to contemporary research on cognition . With the greater attention now given to the control of cognitive processes ( e.g. , Pennebaker , 1989 ; Wegner &; Schneider , 1989 ) , to cognition and stress ( Lazarus , 1984 ) , to cognition and depressionisuicide ( Baumeister , 1990 ) , to perceived self control and self-efficacy as cognitive mediators of stress ( Litt , 1988 ) , and to electrodermal lability and information processing ( Wilson &; Graham , 1989 ) , a reminder of the research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ review and critical analysis of the role of cognition in electrodermal conditioning Grings ( 1973 ) stated the following : <p> . . . the electrodermal response is so sensitive to shifts of attention and the momentary changes in arousal which accompany changes in cognition that it is impossible to eliminate cognitive factors completely from conditioning observational situations . At the same time , this sensitivity gives the electrodermal response an advantage when it comes to direct study of cognitive variables . ( p. 200 ) <p> These comments appear relevant to present day issues . <p> In our prior unpublished research replicating and expanding the efforts of others ( e.g. , as reviewed by Shapiro 1977 ) , and particularly on research related to the cognitive control of EDFs ( Klinge , 1972 ) , we obtained findings in support of the development of the cognitive control of EDFs . The present research extends the study of the cognitive control of EDFs to verbal incentive conditions . This study is also an effort to examine potentially confounding bodily movement and respiratory artifacts of EDF recording . As proposed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artifacts is to examine EDF feedback changes relative to a body movement control condition . Presumably , if control of EDFs corresponds to changes in bodily responses , then , enhanced EDFs would be associated with increases , and reduced EDFs with decreases , of these artifacts of recording . If artifacts account for EDFs , persons instructed to increase EDFs by thinking " emotional thoughts " would be predicted to demonstrate more EDFs and artifacts than persons simply instructed to " sit more quietly . " Furthermore , persons instructed to decrease EDFs by thinking " relaxing thoughts " would be predicted to demonstrate more EDFs and artifacts than persons simply instructed to " sit more quietly . " Persons instructed to decrease EDFs would seemingly be slower to discover that they could do so by simply sitting more quietly than persons irlstructed to sit more quietly at the onset . This design and type of control condition would seem to maximize possible differences between groups in movement artifacts as confounding variables in the interpretation of the control of EDFs . <p> A second variable of concern is that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects of initial levels on subsequent response measures , the possible confounding of EDF control and body artifacts may be more pronounced among selected persons . Seemingly , increases of EDFs and artifacts would be more easily demonstrated among persons who show low-resting levels of EDFs ( nonlabiles ) . On the other hand , decreases of EDFs and artifacts would be more easily demonstrated among persons already showing high levels of EDFs ( labiles ) . <p> Thus , in the present study , nonlabiles encouraged to increase EDFs by " thinking emotional thoughts " were predicted to demonstrate more EDFs and artifacts as compared to a nonlabile control group . And labiles encouraged to decrease EDFs by " thinking relaxing thoughts " were predicted to demonstrate more EDFs and artifacts than a labile control group . Unconfounded comparisons are possible between the verbal incentive conditions and their respective controls . METHOD <p> Participants and Design <p> Eighty female students from an introductory psychology pool from Arizona State University were assigned to either labile or nonlabile conditions based upon initial baseline measures of EDFs and , then , within these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control conditions . Group lability differences are elaborated in the results section . Thus , there were four groups with 20 persons per group . There were two nonlabile groups ( Nonlabile Incentive &; Nonlabile control ) and two labile groups ( Labile Incentive &; Labile control ) . <p> Setting and Apparatus <p> The participants ' room was temperature controlled and sound attenuated . Persons sat in a reclining chair . A white noise generator ( 60db ) was located about 6 feet from the participant . To further reduce the effects of extraneous noise , persons wore a padded headset and also by this means received both instructions and a low-intensity auditory feedback tone ( about 1500 htz ) just above hearing threshold ( about 30 db ) . <p> Exosomatic responses were recorded from the distal volar surfaces of the fore and ring finger of the left hand . These surfaces were first cleaned with alcohol , and then Grass silver-silver clorided recording electrodes ( 9mm in diameter with constant current system of 10 microamperes ) were attached with Grass electrode cream and masking tape . In accordance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the resistance of recording leads was frequently checked and chloriding repeated . As with all measures , EDFS were recorded with a Grass 7B polygraph . Parallel inputs to both a DC and AC preamplifier were used to record resting electrodermal levels and EDFs independent of these baseline resting levels . Fluctuations of 50 ohms or greater triggered a Lafayette Electrodermal Instrument detector , thereby , providing auditory feedback to the participant , and a cumulative record of the number of seconds of EDF during consecutive 1minute periods . A rubber air tube was placed around the upper chest and , together with a pressure sensitive transducer , provided for pneumographic recordings of respiration . General body movements were recorded by attaching recording leads to the chair cover ( Fehr , 1970 ) . Finger movements were also scored from the DC recordings . <p> The Multiple Affect Adjective Check List ( Zuckerman &; Lubin , 1965 ) was used for pre- to post-measurements of affect . Raw scores were converted to T-scores based upon the normative data provided from a sample of college students ( p.7 ) . Extensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found to be persuasive in suggesting that this " list " is a sensitive measure of self-reported affect . <p> Finally , questions were devised as a manipulation check of the conditions of this study . Participants rated each of 10 items on a 4-point scale ( i.e. , not at all , minimally , moderately , very much ) . These items and findings are reviewed in the results section . <p> Procedure <p> Volunteers were recruited by referring to this as a physiological study that involved palmer sweating and the control of emotional thoughts . Upon arrival , persons were reminded of the nature of the study , told that there was no deception and/or unpleasantness in this study , and that they could discontinue at any time . They were first requested to fill out the adjective check list . During the course of attaching the recording leads , persons were instructed as to the nature of the recordings , that instruction would be provided by way of the headset , and that they would hear a tone going on and off in the background . <p> After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which time lability was assessed and group assignment made , participants were told that the tone corresponded to the recording measures of their thinking about either emotional or relaxing life events . Each trial ( interval of 30 to 90 see ) consisted of instructing the participants to " keep the tone on by thinking emotional thoughts " in response to the key word " emotion " for 1 minute , to " keep the tone off by thinking relaxing thoughts " to the key work " relax " for 2 minutes , and to " think about anything " to the key work " break " at the end of the 3-minute period . They were administered two pretest trials with feedback , and , then , following the incentive inducing instructions , four more post-test feedback trials . <p> Incentive inducing instructions were as follows : Labile incentive ( LI ) : " You are doing well to the instruction think emotional thoughts , ' but try to decrease the tone coming on to the instruction " think relaxing thoughts . " Nonlabile Incentive ( NI ) : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' but try to increase the tone coming on to the instruction think emotional thoughts . " Controls : " You are doing well but sit more quietly and avoid movement . " <p> Data Analysis <p> Fluctuations of 50 ohms or greater as measured by a Lafayette Instruments EDF detector , and recorded in 1-minute periods , made up the basic data of the present study . The Lafayette detector seemed to overestimate the duration of EDFs . The device was sensitive to both amplitude and rate of change of EDFs . Total seconds per minute for each response period was recorded , that is , for each of the 1-minute periods of thinking " emotional thoughts " and each of the 2 minute periods of thinking " relaxing thoughts " for trials within each phase of the study . The combined frequency of movement and respiration were tallied for each response period . <p> The analyses of the data were in part influenced by our prior failures to enhance group comparisons by way of statistically correcting EDFs by reference to pre-stimulus values , reciprocally transformed conductance measures , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ untransformed data were analyzed by way of the statistical program provided by Spss/pc+Advanced Statistics V2.0 ( Norusis , 1988 ) for MANOVA : repeated measures design . In order to appraise differences prior to the incentive manipulation , a group lability ( labile and stabile ) by group manipulation ( incentive and control ) by repeated measures ( emotion and relax/mean of minute 1 and 2 ) was computed on the individual means of the two pretest trials . <p> Furthermore , for the reason that the labile and nonlabile incentive groups differed both in terms of the type of instruction inducing incentive they received and also the condition of lability , they were separately analyzed together with their respective control groups : that is , a two group ( Incentive &; Control ) , by six trials ( 2 pre &; 4 post ) comparing ( a ) LI and labile controls , ( b ) NI and nonlabile control . These between groups and within group variables were further analyzed by tests of simple effects ( Scheffe ) in conjunction with one way ANOVAs when appropriate . RESULTS <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tests for homogeneity were significant . Epsilons were generally high and the related corrections of the degrees of freedom seemed unlikely to affect conclusions drawn in subsequent reporting of the results of this study . <p> In terms of the findings prior to the instruction manipulation , the expected difference between the labile ( M = 22.95 , SD = 11.96 ) and nonlabile conditions ( M = 8.73 , SD = 7.33 ) was demonstrated , F(1,76) = 49.85 , p&lt;.000 . Also prior to the manipulation , the emotion condition ( M = 22.31 , SD = 16.22 ) provoked significantly more EDFs than the relax condition ( M = 9.35 , SD = 8.18 ) , F(1,76) = 105.49 , p&lt;.000 . Labiles showed a greater reduction of EDFs from emotion to relax periods than did nonlabiles , F(1,76) = 10.47 , p&lt;.002 . Prior to the manipulation , there were no differences found between persons randomly assigned to the incentive and control groups , F(1,76) = .14 , p = .712 . <p> Figure 1 ( a , b , &; c ) depicts the number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ induced incentive control conditions for each of the three response periods . <p> For the emotion period ( Figure la ) : ( a ) only the trials effect was significant for the LI and control comparisons , F(5,190) = 11.34 , p &lt;.000 ; and ( b ) the groups and interaction effects were significant for the NI and control comparisons , F(1,38) = 6.29 , p&lt;.02 and F(5,190) = 3.85 , p &lt;.02 ) . <p> For the relax period , minute 1 ( Figure lb ) : ( a ) only the trials effect was significant for the LI and control comparisons , F(5,190) = 12.67 , p &lt;.000 ; and ( b ) the groups effect was significant for the NI and control comparisons , F(1,38) = 4.61 , p&lt;.04 . <p> For the relax period , minute 2 ( Figure lc ) : ( a ) there were significant groups and trials effects , F(1,38) = 5.37 , p&lt;.035 and F(5,190) = 2.97 , p &lt;.01 ; and ( b ) none of the effects were significant for the NI and control comparisons . <p> Artifact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were few in number , ranging from .1 to .45 per 1-minute response period , the data were collapsed over trials . <p> The LI as compared to control group showed : significantly fewer artifacts , F(1,38) = 4.30 , p&lt;.O45 ; demonstrated more artifacts for the emotion as compared to the relax condition , F(1,38) = 5.52 , p&lt;.O3. ; and there was a significant reduction of artifacts over trials , F(1,38) = 4.72 , p&lt;.O36 . <p> The NI group showed a significant increase in artifacts as a function of the induced verbal incentive to increase EDFs by " thinking emotional thoughts " as compared to their respective controls , F(1,38) = 4.24 , p&lt;.O5 . <p> Re-Analysis of EDF Findings <p> The EDF findings presented previously were reexamined with consideration given to these corresponding differences of movement and respiratory artifacts . The findings presented in Figure la distinguishing between the NI and control condition are elaborated upon in Figure 2 . Persons in the NI condition were divided into two subgroups : a nonlabile group ( IF* ) that demonstrated essentially no differences in artifacts in the emotion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nonlabile group ( IF** ) that showed relatively more artifacts in the emotion than relax periods . These two groups ( IF* &; IF** ) were not significantly different from one another , F(1,18) = .00 , p = .96 , nor were the trials and interaction effects , F(1,18) = 1.8 , p = .13 and F(1,18) = .61 , p = .69 . <p> Affect and Manipulation Check Findings <p> From tests of simple effects ( Scheffe ) of the 10 manipulation check questions , both the LI and NI groups reported significant greater ability to sustain thinking " emotional thoughts " on posttrials than control groups , F(3,76) = 1.85 , p&lt;.05 . Overall , about 90% of persons reported that the feedback tone was " not at all " to " minimally " unpleasant and that they could easily understand and remember the tape recorded instructions . Many persons responded " moderate " to " very much " in ( a ) identifying the tone with their thinking emotional thoughts ( 76% ) , ( b ) their ability to think about emotional events during the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last few trials of this study ( incentive , 76% ; control , 43% ) , ( c ) their ability to think " relaxing thoughts " during the first few trials ( 66% ) and the last few trials of this study ( 84% ) , and ( d ) with their overall state of relaxation at the end as compared to the beginning of the study ( 85% ) . <p> Correlational Findings <p> Correlations were computed on all 1 I pretest measures . There were significant relationships between anxiety ( A ) , hostility ( H ) and depression ( D ) measures ( A/H=. 70 , AID=. 65 , H/D=. 71 , p&lt;.01 in each case , N = 80 ) . There were significant relationships between EDFs recorded on emotion and relax pretrials ranging from . 42 to . 76 , p&lt; .01 in each case . A serendipitous finding was the consistent negative relationship between preanxiety levels and pre- to post-change in anxiety levels ( LI , NI , LI &; NI controls , respectively , r = - .63 , - .80 , - .69 , - .79 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> There were also significant relationships between the number of artifacts and the number of seconds of EDFs ranging from .24 to .51 , p&lt;.05 for each of 10 of 12 periods examined . Differences between the incentive and control groups were unaffected by ANCOVA with artifacts as the covariant DISCUSSION <p> There was partial support for the hypotheses of the present study and some interesting qualifications of the role of movement and respiratory artifacts as they relate to the cognitive control of EDFs . There were increases in both EDFs and artifacts for the NI group instructed to increase EDFs by " thinking emotional thoughts . " However , this finding was mitigated by the subsequent comparison in the NI group of persons who demonstrated few , if any , artifacts with persons who showed significantly more artifacts in their recordings . There were no EDF differences between these subdivided low and high artifact groups . Thus , the incentive to increase " thinking emotional thoughts " for the NI group appeared to be a significant variable in the development of the EDFs during the emotion period . Similarly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the LI as compared to their control group . The LI group showed fewer artifacts in their recordings than controls , but no difference of EDFs . <p> The present findings are consistent with the reports of others in which electrodermal responses were readily demonstrated in response to exteroceptive feedback of EDFs and the instruction to " think " emotional as compared to relaxing thoughts . Shapiro , Crider , and Tursky ( 1964 ) with skin potential , and Stern and Kaplan ( 1967 ) with skin resistance changes provided early findings in support of this control . And , Klinge ( 1972 ) has differentiated this method of feedback with emotion and relax instructions from several control comparisons . She suggested that EDFs " occur independent of identifiable mediation or involvement of systematic changes in respiration or heart rate " ( p. 315 ) . The results of the present study are consistent with this conclusion : that is , for the Nl subgroups , both low- and high-artifact producers showed equal increases of EDFs relative to controls . This finding is also consistent with the report of Gavalas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of both elicited and nonspecific EDRs with induced skeletal respiratory mediators over trials . As noted by Gavalas , one may always assert that " some other unobserved response is doing the mediating " ( p. 195 ) . <p> As indicated at the beginning of this article , these methods and findings may have implications for the study of cognitive processes . As useful methods for the study of cognitive and emotional processes , instructional and feedback control of EDFs may be demonstrated to have increased utility and validity . In her research , Klinge ( 1972 ) proposed that feedback may offer convincing evidence to a person that they are , in fact , succeeding in their attempt to control their physiological responses . This suggestion would seem to correspond to contemporary research on self control and self efficacy . As noted by Litt ( 1988 ) , perceived self-efficacy and perceived control would appear to be important mediators of stress and " may directly influence levels of catecholamines and endogenous opiates that affect perceived distress and pain " ( p. 250 ) . In the present study , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think about emotional events in their present and past life than control groups . Perhaps this was a reflection of their belief that they had increased their self control , a control that may have implications for dealing with stress . However , there were no differences in rated anxiety of the four groups , and only the LI group demonstrated increased EDFs . These results may be clarified by research on more relevant clinical groups and by the use of more prolonged and intensive procedures . <p> Baumeister ( 1990 ) has evolved an important theory of suicide as an escape from an awareness of " self 's inadequacies " and associated negative affect . A " deconstructed state " ( constricted focus , concrete thinking , rejection of meaning ) is proposed to result in the impulsive and drastic act of suicide . In an engaging presentation titled " Mental Control : The War of the Ghosts in the Machine , " Wegner and Schneider ( 1989 ) detail some novel methods and findings that relate to control , depression , and , indirectly , to suicide . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughts , and , possibly their moods . They note that depressed persons tend to suppress negative thoughts only to experience a resurgence , a rebound effect , shortly after their initial successes . Moreover , depressed persons tend to try to distract themselves from negative thoughts with other negative thoughts . Seemingly , the methods and findings reviewed here could be readily applied to the study and control of these thoughts . In the present study , there were no changes in depressive mood from pre- to post-testing . Again using a more relevant clinical group , and a methodology that manipulates depressive mood , these methods may be extended to this important cognitive area of study . <p>
