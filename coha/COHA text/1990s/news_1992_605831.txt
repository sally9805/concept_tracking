<p> A battle is about to unfold on Capitol Hill that is likely to shape the nation 's telecommunications future as no other event since the 1984 breakup of the telephone system , according to industry and congressional officials . <p> The main combatants in the fight , which opens tomorrow before a House subcommittee , are two of America 's most powerful industries  --  newspaper publishers and the seven regional telephone companies . But the outcome also could affect other large businesses , including long-distance carriers , phone equipment manufacturers , data-processing firms and the cable television industry . <p> The newspaper industry  --  including The Washington Post  --  is trying to convince Congress to bar the regional telephone companies , known as Baby Bells , from entering the information services business , which the publishers say the phone companies would unfairly dominate because they control the lines into the nation 's homes and businesses . <p> The phone companies , among them Bell Atlantic Corp. , parent of the Chesapeake &; Potomac Telephone Cos. in this area , are gearing up to provide an array of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One innovation would allow a caller to leave a message on someone 's phone  --  at 3 a.m. , say  --  without ringing it . Or a person could program his or her phone or computer ( or a future hybrid ) to wake him or her in the morning with preset selections of news , weather , scores of home teams , traffic along the car pool route and a reminder to pick up a carton of milk . <p> Students could study from home on their phone-computers , immigrants could learn English , the deaf could type messages  --  in the Bells ' vision , the possibilities are endless . The Baby Bells say that because their local network reaches everywhere , no one can bring these new services to American households faster than they can . It is precisely that power , the publishers say , that could enable the Baby Bells to dominate the new world of electronic information services . <p> Until recently the phone companies appeared confident of besting the opponents who are trying to restrict their activities . But the phone companies have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ )  --  chairman of the House Judiciary Committee , an old-line populist and enemy of monopolies  --  announced this week 's hearings . Brooks has voiced strong doubts about allowing the phone companies into not only information services , but also phone equipment manufacturing and long-distance service . <p> The Baby Bells place their hopes in another House committee chairman , Rep. John Dingell ( D-Mich. ) , who heads the Energy and Commerce Committee , which oversees telecommunications legislation . Dingell said he is interested in the technological innovations the Bells promise , and he expresses frustration with the press , arguing , as the Bells do , that many newspapers are themselves monopolies . <p> The stakes in the battle are so huge that lobbyists and Hill insiders say they can not predict the outcome . " It 's like a four-dimensional chess game ... played at lightning speed , " said one telephone company lobbyist . <p> Publishers warn that if the phone companies enter the information services business , the loss of advertising revenue will drive some newspapers out of business while steadily eroding the franchises of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would be newspapers without the cushion of other investments and small papers that may lack funds to continue the fight . <p> As the dust swirls over this issue , some legislators say , the phone companies may be given limited entry into the cable television business , which would alarm cable interests but please those favoring more competition in that industry . <p> " You do n't know who 's going to cut deals with who , and how this thing will play out , " Dingell said . " All these deals are tied together . ... Billions of dollars are at stake . " <p> The publishers ' nightmare is the phone companies ' plan for so-called " electronic Yellow Pages . " These services could arrive in a decade or so when , industry officials and academics predict , most American homes will have a phone that has attributes of a computer . Then people could get a wide selection of news and other information from the device  --  and could view advertisements for products and services , making choices and payments over the phone connections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1967 MG . Instead of poring through a newspaper 's classified section , you could sign onto the phone-box and get a list of all the nation 's used MGs for sale , or only the convertibles , or only the red ones . <p> Baby Bells Get Busy <p> The seeds of the current confrontation were planted with the Justice Department 's 1974 antitrust suit against AT &T,; then the world 's biggest monopoly . To settle the suit , AT &T; 10 years later divested itself of its local telephone operations , which became the seven Baby Bells . <p> U.S. District Judge Harold H. Greene , who presided over the settlement and breakup , banned the Baby Bells from three activities  --  information services , phone equipment manufacturing and long-distance service . He said he wanted to avoid re-creating the problems of the old AT &T,; which smothered competition and stifled innovation . <p> But the Bells soon began trying to wriggle out of these prohibitions . Last June , after a ferocious lobbying effort , the Senate voted 71-24 to let the Bells manufacture phone equipment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Greene , under pressure from the U.S. Court of Appeals , reluctantly agreed to let the Bells into information services . And there are signs the appeals court will lift Greene 's ban on the last activity , as well . <p> ' The Fight of Our Lives ' <p> Cathleen Black had just left a job as USA Today 's publisher to become president of the American Newspaper Publishers Association ( ANPA ) when Greene dropped his surprise ruling in July . " To the newspaper industry , " she recalled recently , " what happened on Thursday , July 25 , was a 10-point earthquake and an atom bomb . " <p> " Our ability to compete in the media business is in jeopardy , " the ANPA warned members days after Greene 's ruling . " If we do n't fight the fight of our lives , " Black told news executives , the result would be " a grave injustice . " <p> The Bells ' enemies range from burglar alarm companies to data-processing firms , who fear their customers will be lured away . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gene Eidenberg , executive vice president of MCI Communications Corp. , another opponent . MCI worries that if one of Greene 's restrictions is lifted , all will fall and the Bells will jump into long-distance market . <p> But newspapers are leading the charge . For the first time publishers are inviting their local congressmen in for coffee and a plea for help . The ANPA has lawyers , ad agencies and lobbyists such as Thomas H. Boggs Jr . pressing its cause . But it 's been outgunned . <p> The seven Bells , which have been lobbying Congress for years on these issues , is outspending the publishers by at least 20 to 1 , Black maintained . The Bells ' annual revenue is about $ 80 billion , compared with $ 33 billion for the publishers . <p> " It 's one of the most expensive lobbying battles in all congressional history , " said Rep. Jim Cooper ( D-Tenn. ) , sponsor of a bill favored by the publishers that would delay the Baby Bells ' plans for years . <p> Neither side reveals its expenditures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $ 20 million annually on the effort for several years . Ronald Stowe  --  Washington representative for one of the regional companies , Pacific Telesis Group , and the Bells ' lead strategist  --  said that figure is too high . <p> The phone companies have retained dozens of former Federal Communications Commission staffers , lawyers and public-relations specialists . Many of the Bells ' 505,000 employees  --  pressed into action by their union , the Communications Workers of America  --  have contacted Congress on behalf of their employers . <p> Although outspent , the publishers of the nation 's 1,400 papers have " incredible access , " said a congressional staffer . And they have editorial pages , many of which campaign against the Bells . <p> The ANPA has known for years this day might arrive . Its leaders lobbied Congress in fits and starts during the 1980s , but generally believed their lawyers ' assurances that Greene would n't free the Baby Bells from the original strictures . <p> " They 're trying to go from 0 to 60 , " a key House staffer said of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 're not used to gearing up . " <p> In December , Washington Post Co . Chairman Katharine Graham paid her first visit to the Hill in 11 years , a reception for cosponsors of Cooper 's bill , her associates said . Her previous visit was in 1980 , in an early attempt to get Congress to keep the phone company out of electronic publishing . <p> Asking politicians for favors is not a familiar posture for the publishers . They 've dealt with elected officials at times on such issues as recycling , but news business ethics command that they remain aloof as much as possible from politics . <p> " The publishers are a notoriously weak lobbying force , " Cooper said . " They 're not comfortable doing it . " <p> " They feel it 's below them , " said Rep. Michael Oxley ( R-Ohio ) , who sides with the phone companies . " They do n't want to dirty their hands with such mundane matters . " <p> Oxley had an unpleasant experience with one media executive from his home state , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , sources said . The man , co-owner of some newspapers and cable stations , warned Oxley he should not push Baby Bell bills , including one letting them into the cable TV business . The executive told an Oxley aide his family 's Ohio paper " would look askance " at Oxley 's activities . Soon the paper ran a front-page article denouncing the expense of Oxley trips . The ANPA later apologized to Oxley and said it was an aberration . <p> The Bells themselves infuriated many members of Congress last fall , several legislators said , when , a year before congressional elections , they ran slashing radio ads against Cooper and cosponsors of his pro-publisher bill . The ad campaigns , which the targets guessed cost $ 150,000 each , ran in their home districts . <p> Some , like Rep. Dan L. Schaefer ( D-Colo. ) , endured Bell-orchestrated phone barrages , too . The Bells urged their employees to dial toll-free 1-800-numbers , and then connected the angry callers to congressional offices . It 's the first time anyone recalls the phone company using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the ads were aired " to impose a penalty on those who sponsored the Cooper bill , " a Hill staffer recalled . <p> " Word spread like wildfire , and it enraged a number of congressmen , " Cooper said . " But it also served its purpose of intimidating . " <p> Dingell 's Stance <p> Unfortunately for the ANPA , one congressman who sources said has been angry about press coverage of him is Dingell . The ANPA 's Black said Dingell has been cordial in meetings with ANPA visitors . But a staff member said Dingell " takes a certain delight " in seeing wealthy publishers as supplicants . <p> Dingell echoes some of the Bells ' arguments against the papers , such as that they are large institutions out to protect their financial interests . He recounts a piece of history Bell lobbyists frequently drop in conversation : In the 1930s , publishers were so scared of losing revenue to the then-new radio industry that they threatened to get Congress to pass a bill restricting it . Then publishers forced the puny radio stations into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , and no news report could be more than 30 words long . The agreement died after publishers started buying their own radio stations . <p> " In the telecommunications business , " Dingell said , " the battles are between the very rich and the very wealthy . " <p> The Bells try to portray the papers as near-monopolies themselves , and they 've prepared glossy pamphlets for dozens of congressmen saying that their hometown papers have raised ad rates at will , and faster than the inflation rate . <p> " By keeping us out , they keep their monopoly , " said Bell lobbying chief Stowe . " The right answer is competition . " <p> That , of course , is the ANPA 's central thesis as well : that once the Bells enter the information field , they 'll have a stranglehold on competitors . For the first time , the Bells no longer would be neutral carriers of voice and data traffic , but would be competing against other providers of information services who are obliged to use the Bells ' lines . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opponents say , or it could deny technological advances to competitors while installing them in its own services . <p> The ANPA points to a range of alleged anti-competitive and predatory abuses committed by regional Bell companies and exposed recently by regulators in Georgia , California and New York , among other places . <p> Bell executives say they would n't try to harm future competitors in the information business because regulators would catch them and because forcing customers under is bad business . <p> But there is no doubt the Bells control their markets  --  they supply phone service to as much as 99 percent of the homes and businesses in their areas . Even so , the first spring crocuses of competition have sprouted lately  --  mainly some cellular telephone firms and new companies laying fiber-optic cables for large business customers  --  and the competitors are growing fast . <p> The publishers want to keep the Bells out of information services until these infant Bell competitors can grow strong . Their vehicle is the Cooper bill and a similar one sponsored by Sen. Daniel Inouye ( D-Hawaii ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information business for 12 years . The Cooper bill would delay a Bell company 's entry until 10 percent of all customers in a Bell 's area subscribe to a Bell competitor . Cooper guesses that would take 10 years , but Bell executives say it could be decades . <p> Congressmen and lobbyists interviewed said the publishers ' Cooper and Inouye bills are all but dead because many legislators think these " market entry tests " are too stringent . <p> But many legislators agree with other features of the bills , which say that if the Bells get into information , they must set up independent subsidiaries for it . The bills also bar the Bells from " cross-subsidizing " these new ventures with the guaranteed stream of revenue from their local phone monopolies . <p> Ultimately , the debate may rise and fall on the popularity of the technology the Bells are introducing . <p> Kenneth Robinson , a top FCC aide , said that because Japan and Europe are way ahead of the United States on information services , he senses Congress is less preoccupied with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Bell monopoly than with " how do we make good things happen " with its technology . <p> A Bell-financed report by conservative lawyer Phillip Mink said publishers are " behaving like the 18th-century ' Luddites ' who once destroyed machinery they feared could replace their jobs . ... They fear that new telecommunications technologies will send newspapers the way of buggy whips . " <p> A Bell pamphlet lists dozens of electronic information services they say eventually could be available : home health-monitoring for the elderly , translation services for the foreign-born , and on and on . <p> Black said many of the new technologies they are touting already exist , and that it is " a lie " to suggest that only the Bells will bring them . <p> But the Bells argue that because they themselves are so large and can operate with economies of scale , they are better equipped than anyone to bring new phone-based technologies to market and to make them available to tens of millions of Americans . <p> Kenneth Pitt , Bell Atlantic 's spokesman , said that since Greene 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feverishly on new services , the first of which likely will be unveiled in a few months . <p> Action on the Hill <p> One of the hottest debates on the Hill will be between Brooks 's and Dingell 's committees , each of which is expected to claim jurisdiction over the issue . <p> Brooks recently said that it 's " disingenuous " and " dangerous " to try to spur technological progress without protecting consumers , and that Congress may have to draft new laws for " this unruly industry . " He 's trying to codify into law a ban on the Bells ' entry into the three lines of business Greene barred them from until they face more competition . <p> Dingell has deputized Rep. Edward Markey ( D-Mass. ) , chairman of the telecommunications subcommittee , to draw up legislation . Markey is trying to fashion a compromise between the Bells and the ANPA , but sources say he has n't found one because the two are so far apart . <p> " A lot of us wish the issue would go away , " Oxley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to choose between our publisher and the local Bell company .
