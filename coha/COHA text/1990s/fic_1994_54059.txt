THE SUN , HIGH IN THE HOT August afternoon , sent short shadows across the neatly trimmed grass . A small clump of people huddled in a semicircle , close but not touching . The coffin , in the center , sat on a platform covering the empty hole . <p> Dylan placed a rose on the black lacquer surface , and stepped back . A moment , frozen in time and space . <p> A hand clutched his shoulder . Firm grip , meant as reassurance . He turned . Ross nodded to him , mouth a thin line . <p> " She was a good woman , " Ross whispered . <p> Dylan nodded . The minister was speaking , but he did n't care about the words , even though the rest of the group strained forward . <p> " She would have found this silly , " Dylan said , and then stopped . Ross 's expression had changed from one of sympathy to something else  --  confusion. : Disapproval ? . Dylan did n't know , and did n't really want to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fragile , as if his entire body was formed of the thinnest crystal . One wrong look , a movement , a shadow on the grass , would shatter him into a thousand pieces . <p> A thousand pieces . Shards , scattered on the kitchen floor . Geneva , crouched over them , like a cat about to pounce . Look , Dylan , she said . To us , a glass shattered forever . But to the universe , possibilities . A thousand possibilities . <p> He stared at the black box . He could picture Geneva inside as she had looked the night before : black hair cascading on the satin ; skin too white ; eyes closed in imitation sleep . Geneva had never been so still . <p> He wondered what she would say if she stood beside him , her hand light on his arm , the summer sun kissing her hair . <p> For just a moment , trapped in space and time . <p> Stars twinkled over the ocean . Dylan stood on the damp sand , Geneva beside him , her hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only warm thing on the chilly beach . Occasionally the wind would brash a strand of her hair across his face . She would push at her hair angrily , but he liked the touch , the faint shampoo smell of her . <p> She was staring at the waves , a frown touching the comers of her mouth . " Hear it ? " she asked . <p> He listened and heard nothing except the pulse of the ocean , powerful , throbbing , a pulse that had more life than he did . " Hear what ? " <p> " The waves . " <p> In her pause , he listened to them crash against the sand , the heart of the pulse . <p> " It 's so redundant , " she said . <p> " What is ? " He turned , his attention fully on her . She looked like a clothed Venus , rising out of the sand , hair wrapped around her , eyes sparkling with unearthly light . <p> " Sound is a wave , a wave is sound . We stand here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> He leaned into her , feeling her solidness , her warmth . " It is beautiful . " <p> She grinned at him . " It 's inspiring , " she said , and pulled her hand out of his pocket . She walked down to the edge where the Pacific met the Oregon coast . He did n't move , but watched her instead , wishing he could paint . She looked so powerful standing there , one small woman facing an ocean , against a backdrop of stars . <p> He went through her papers for the university , separating them into piles with equations and piles without . The cat sat on the piles without , watching the proceeding with a solemnness that suited the occasion . <p> Dylan 's knowledge of physics and astronomy came from Geneva . He had had three semesters in college , a series called Physics for Poets ( hardly any equations ) , and by the time he met her , most of his knowledge was out of date . <p> ( If you knew so little about women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you what my clitoris is . ) <p> His specialty was philosophy , not so much of the religious type , even though he could get lost in Middle Ages monkish romanticism , but more a political strip : Descartes , Locke , Hegel , and John Stuart Mill . He liked to ponder unanswerable questions . He had met Geneva that way  --  one afternoon , wind off the lake , Wisconsin in the summer , sitting on the Union Terrace , soaking up the rays and pretending to study . Only he was n't even pretending , he was arguing basic freshman philosophy : if a tree falls in the forest , and no one hears it , does it make a sound ? Geneva had been passing at the time  --  all legs and tan and too big glasses on a too small nose . <p> Of course , she said , because it makes a disturbance and the disturbance makes a wave , and that wave is sound . <p> He did n't remember what he said in response . Something intriguing enough to make her sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the mosquitos had driven the other students away . <p> From that moment on , he and Geneva always talked that way . The philosophy of physics . The physics of philosophy . He got the education without the equations and she , she felt free enough to explore the imaginative side of her science  --  the tiny particles no one could see , the unified theories , the strings binding the universe . <p> There 's something out there , Dylan , she would say , and it 's more than we are . <p> He knew that , as he held her papers , in her sunlit office just past their den . In her crabbed writing , on those dot-matrix computer sheets , was the secret to something . <p> If he could touch that , he could touch her . And if he could touch her , he might be able to hold her . <p> Forever . <p> The campus bar was full of people impossibly young . Dylan grabbed his frosty mug of beer and sat across from Ross , watching the people intermingle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the students wore their hair short , and the professors wore theirs long . Dylan sipped , let the foam catch him full on his upper lip , and let the sound of co-mingled voices and too loud music wash over him . <p> " I worry about you , " Ross said . His beer was dark and warm . Its color matched the tweed blend of his blazer . " You 've locked yourself up in that house , and have n't gone anywhere in weeks . You do n't have to get her papers in order before the end of the term , Dylan . The department just wants them on file . " <p> Dylan shook his head . He was n't always working . Sometimes he wandered from room to room , touching her clothes , the small sculpture she had brought back from Africa , the pieces of Inuit-carved whale bone they had found in Alaska . " I 'll get it done , " he said . <p> " That 's not the point . " Ross pushed his beer aside , ignoring it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward , and would probably have touched Dylan 's arm if Dylan had been the kind of man who permitted it . " She 's dead , Dylan . She 's gone . She was a spectacular woman , but now you have to get used to living without her . " <p> Dylan stared at Ross 's hand , outstretched on the scarred wooden table . " But what if she is n't really dead ? I can feel her sometimes , Ross , as close to me as you are . " <p> " That 's part of grievings " Ross said . " You 're in the habit of feeling her presence . It 's like a ghost limb . You know it was there ; you know what it felt like , and you ca n't believe it 's gone . " <p> " No . " Dylan 's fingers were frozen to the side of the mug . He pulled them away . " She was working on space-time equations , did you know that ? " <p> Ross removed his hand from the tabletop , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the funeral  --  back on his face . " Of course I knew that . We have to report on her research twice a term . " <p> " She said she was close to something . That we thought about time wrong . That we were looking for beginnings and endings , and they were n't important  --  and possibly not even probable . She said we were limited by the way we think , Ross . " <p> " It 's not a new area , " Ross said . A cocktail waitress went by , her tray loaded with heavy beer mugs . Patrons ducked and slipped into each other to stay out of her way . " We 've been exploring space-time since Einstein . Geneva was going over very old ground . The department was going to re-examine her position if she had n't taken a new angie this term . " <p> " Her angle was new . " Dylan wiped his hands on his jeans . " It was new from the beginning . She said the problem was not in the physical world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She said  --  " <p> " I know what she said . " Ross 's voice was gentle . " It 's not physics , Dylan . It 's philosophy . " <p> Dylan 's entire body tensed . " I did n't change her , Ross . She was thinking this way when we met , when she was an undergraduate . She said that our limitations limited the way we looked at the universe , and she 's right . You know she 's right . " <p> " We already know about space-time , " Ross said . " About the lack of beginnings and the lack of endings . We know all that  --  " <p> " But we still think in linear terms . If we truly understood relativity , time would be all encompassing . We would experience everything at once . " <p> " Dylan , " Ross said , his voice soft . " Linear time keeps us sane . " <p> " No , " Dylan said . " That 's why ancient maps had dragons on them , and why no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got imprisoned for showing the universe did n't work the way the church wanted it to . You all got upset at her because she was showing you that your minds were as narrow as the ancients ' , that you have your theories of everything and think you can understand it all , when you do n't take into account your own beings . She is doing physics , Ross . You 're just too blind to see it . " <p> Dylan stood up . The conversation around him had stopped , and tile short-haired , too-young students were staring at him . Ross was looking at his hands . <p> Dylan waited , breathing heavily , a pressure inside his chest that he had never felt before . Ross finally looked up , his round face empty of all emotion . " The anger , " he said . " It 's part of grieving too . " <p> They first tried it in her dorm room , shutters closed on the only window , lights off so that the posters of Einstein were hidden , so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowded , side by side , on her narrow bed , after removing their clothes in the dark . He could smell her musk , feel the warmth of her , but as he leaned into her body , she moved away . <p> " We ca n't touch , " she said . " Defeats the purpose . " <p> So they lay there , staring up at the bright pink and green stars . And she began speaking softly , her voice no more than a murmur in his ear . <p> She told him what she liked to do with him , how he tasted , how soft his mouth was , how sensitive his ear . She worked her way down his body , never touching him , only talking to him , until he thought he could wait no longer . And then she was on top of him , wet already , nipples hard , and within a few seconds , they had worked their way to mutual orgasm  --  the best he had ever had . <p> She rolled back beside him , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It really works . " <p> GHOST LIMB . From the moment Ross mentioned it , Dylan felt not one but dozens of ghost limbs throughout the house . Here , in the bedroom , done in designer pink by the previous owner ( all we need is a big bow on the bed , and it 'll be perfect  --  for eight-year-old girls , Geneva said ) . Something they were going to remodel when the money allowed . The small side room , well heated , well lit , filled with boxes and scraps of Christmas wrapping : he saw babies in there . First the little boy , cherubic face puckered in sleep . Then a little girl , all wide-eyed and exploring , Geneva in the raw . Future ghosts , possibilities lopped off with the branch that was Geneva . <p> One night he woke in the dark , confident that he had just missed her . Her scent lingered ; the energy of her presence electrified the space . He knew , just a moment before , that she had been there  --  Geneva @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> He got up and went into the living room . The cat followed him , sleepy and dazed . Together they stared out the wide living room window at the street . A long streetlight illuminated a patch of concrete . The light 's reflection made the neighboring homes look gray and indistinct . Ghost homes , full of possibilities . <p> The cat got bored and leapt from the sill , but when Dylan closed his eyes , he could still see her , outlined in red shadow against his eyelids . Even though she was alive , moving , and breathing , the cat too left ghosts . <p> It flashed across his mind , then , the possibility  --  and as quickly as it appeared , it was gone . But he knew it was there . He knew he would find it , and then he would no longer be alone , among the ghosts . <p> " Dammit . The little shit ! " Geneva 's voice rose on the last syllable , so Dylan knew she was n't upset , just inconvenienced . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front door , hands against her hips . " Cat 's out , " she said . <p> He glanced out the door . The cat sat on the porch huddled against the rain , acting as if the world had betrayed her by getting her wet . He picked her up and carried her inside , closing the door with his foot . <p> Geneva reached beyond him and locked the bolt . <p> " There 's no need , " he said . " Door 's closed . " <p> Geneva grinned at him . He dropped the cat and she scampered into the living room , pausing at the end of the couch to dean the vile wetness off her fur . <p> " Little shit , " Geneva said again . She was staring at the cat fondly . " She figured out the door . I came out here in time to see her grasp the knob in both paws and turn . " <p> " Cats ca n't do that , " he said . <p> " No . Dogs ca n't . Cats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nose . " Imagine , being trapped by your mental abilities . A cat can get out of a man-made trap . A dog ca n't . " <p> Then she smiled as if she had solved the riddle of the universe , went back into her office , and closed the door . <p> He had chalk on his hands . Facing all those clean , bright students , he felt rumpled and old . Most of them sat before him because his elective brought them three credits . Only a handful liked to grasp the elemental questions as much as he did . He rubbed his hands together , saw chalk motes drift in the fluorescent light . <p> " The Deists believed in a clockmaker god , " he said , leaning against the metal lip of the blackboard . " A god who invented the world , then sat back and watched it play , like a great ticking clock . Jefferson believed in Deism . Some say that was why he became a great political philosopher  --  he believed that God no longer intervened in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Dylan paused , remembering Geneva 's face when he had discussed this with her , so many years ago . None of the students had her sharpness , her quick fascination with things of the mind . He waited for someone to raise a hand , to ask why those who believed in God the clockmaker did n't believe in predetermination , but no one asked . He could n't go into his long explanation without prompting , and he did n't feel like prompting himself . <p> He waved a hand , almost said , " Never mind , " but did n't . " Read chapters thirteen and fourteen , " he said to those blank faces , " and write me a paper about the contradictions in Deistic philosophy . " <p> " By tomorrow ? " someone asked . <p> " Four pages , " he said tiredly . " I 'm letting you out early . " They looked at him as if he had betrayed them . " You can do four pages . It 's not the great American novel . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room . The hallway was quiet . It smelled faintly of processed air , and looked cleaner than it did when filled with students . Down the stairs , he heard a door slam . A moment later , a woman appeared on the staircase . <p> She was tiny , blonde , her hair wrapped around her skull like a turban . When she looked up , he recognized her . Hollings , from psychology . <p> " What are you pondering so seriously ? " she asked . <p> He studied her for a minute , then decided to answer truthfully . " If God were a watchmaker , like the Deists believed , and if he abandoned his watch , which they did not believe , would n't that leave a vacuum ? Would n't that vacuum have to be filled ? " <p> Her mouth opened slightly , revealing an even row of perfect white teeth . Then she closed it again . " A watchmaker makes a watch and gives it to someone else . Presumably the watch owner maintains the watch . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of watchmakers . " <p> " Indeed it does . " She smiled and walked away . <p> He watched her go , wondering if the exchange had happened or if he had imagined it . He thought no one besides Geneva would engage in flip philosophies . <p> Perhaps he was wrong . <p> Perhaps he had been wrong about a lot of things . <p> They lay on their backs on the public dock . Below them , Devil 's Lake lapped at the wood , trying to reach them . In the distance , they could hear the ocean , shushing its way to shore . The Oregon night was cool , not cold , and they used each other for warmth . <p> Above them , in the Perseids , meteors showered at the rate of one per minute . Dylan oooed his appreciation , but Geneva remained unusually silent . She snuggled closer and slipped her hand in his . It was thinner than it used to be . He could feel the delicate bones in her palm . <p> " I wonder , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of me . " <p> He tensed . She did n't talk about the cancer much , and when she did , it often presaged a deep depression . " You wonder if what 's going on inside of you ? " <p> " If somewhere , deep down , two tiny beings are lying on the equivalent of a dock on the equivalent of a lake , watching cells die . " <p> " We 're watching history , " he said . " The cells are dying inside you now . " <p> " But who knows how long it takes the message to reach those two tiny beings on the lake equivalent ? If the sun died now , we would n't know for another eight minutes . So to us , the sun would still be alive , even though it was dead . " <p> Her words sent a shudder through him . He imagined himself , talking to her , listening to her response , even though she was already dead . <p> " We think about it wrong , you know , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and breathing , and snuggled against him . He would know when she died . <p> " Think about what wrong ? " <p> " Time . We act as if it moves in a linear fashion , straight from here on as if nothing would change . But our memories change . The fact that we have memories means that time is not linear . String theory postulates twenty-five dimensions , and we can barely handle the three we see . We 're like cats and dogs and doors . " <p> " And if we could think in time that was n't linear , how would it be ? " <p> He could feel her shrug , sharp shoulder bones moving against his ribcage . " I do n't know . Maybe we would experience everything at once . All our life , from birth to death , would be in our minds at the same time . Only we would n't look at it as a line . We look at it like a pond , full of everything , full of us . " <p> Her words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could barely feel . " Geneva . " He kept his voice quiet , like the lapping of the water against the dock . " What are you saying ? " <p> She sat up then , blocking his view of the meteor showers , her face more alive than it had been in weeks . " I 'm saying do n't mourn for me . Mourning is a function of linear time . " <p> " Geneva , " he said with a resolution he did n't feel . " You 're not going to die . " <p> " Exactly , " she said , and rested her head on his chest . <p> He pulled open the heavy oak doors and went inside . The chancel smelled vaguely of candle wax and pine branches , even though it was n't Christmas . A red carpet ran down the aisles between the heavy brown pews . The altar stood at the front like a small fortress . He had n't been inside a church since he was a teenager , and inside this one now , he felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a moment like this . <p> A ghost limb . <p> He smiled just a little , half afraid that the minister would find him , and order him out . He sat in a back pew and stared at the altar , hoping the words would come back to him . He ran through the rituals in his mind . Standing up for the opening hymn , watching the choir process , listening to the readings , singing more hymns , and then the offering  --  and the music . <p> . . . as it was in the beginningis now and ever shall beworld without end.Amen.Amen . World without end . He picked up a hymnal , stuck in the back of the pew , and thumbed through it . They listed the Doxology , but not the year it was written , nor the text it was written from . Surely it did n't have the meaning that he interpreted . When it came to the church , the hymn probably meant life ever after . Not time without end . Not beginnings without endings , endings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had never been in this church before , of that he was certain . So the ghost limb he brought with him applied to the Presbyterian church in Wisconsin , the one in which he was raised , where they too sang the Doxology , where a red carpet ran down the aisle , where the altar rose like a fortress . <p> Then a memory came , as dear and fresh as a drop of spring water . He could n't have been more than eight , sitting beside his father on Christmas Eve , listening to the way that God had sent his only son to earth , to have him die for our sins . <p> And why , Dylan asked , if God had a son , why did n't God have a father ! <p> Because God is the father , his father replied . And no matter how much probing Dylan did , he could n't get at a better answer <p> The beginnings of a philosopher  --  the search for the deeper meanings . Not being satisfied with the pat , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him away from the church , away , even , from God , and into Geneva , whom he felt understood the mysteries of the universe . <p> He would n't find Geneva here . She felt that the church destroyed thought . He did n't know why he had come looking in the first place . <p> Bare feet on the deck , cat behind her , hat tipped down over her eyes . Geneva was n't moving . Geneva , frozen in sunlight . <p> " How 'd it go ? " he asked . <p> The cat leapt off the chair , robbed her soft fur against his legs , demanding attention . He crouched and scratched her back , all the while watching Geneva . <p> " They imprisoned Copemicus , " she said , not moving . " Newton too . They kicked Einstein out of Germany , and made Socrates drink hemlock . " <p> " It did n't go well , then , " he said , sitting on the deck chair beside her . <p> She tilted her hat up , revealing her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Depends on your point of view . If they accepted me , I probably was n't on enough of an edge . " <p> He did n't know how to respond . He was secretly relieved that she had n't gotten the post-doc . MIT was an excellent school , and an even better research facility , but she would have been in Boston , and he would have been in Oregon . Together only on breaks and during term 's end . <p> " Did you ever think of working on your theories on your own time ? " he asked . <p> " And give those stupid committees the pap that they want ? " She sat up then , and whipped her hat off her head , letting her black hair cascade around her shoulders . " You ever think of becoming a Baptist ? " <p> " Geneva , it 's not the same . " <p> " It is too the same . People become arbiters of thought . In your area , the church still holds . In mine , it 's the universities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not . Scientists are children , Dylan , little precious children , who look at the world as if it is brand new  --  because it is brand new to them . And they ask silly questions , and expect cosmic answers , and when the answers do n't come , they go searching . And if they ca n't ask the silly questions , if they get slapped every time they do , their searches get smaller , their discoveries get smaller , and the world becomes a ridiculous , narrow place . " <p> She plopped her hat back on her head , swung her tanned legs off the deck chair and stood up . " I can make you come without even touching you . Just the power of our minds , working together . Imagine if the right combination of minds , working together , break through the boundaries that hold us in our place in the universe . We might be able to see the Big Bang at the same moment we see the universe 's end . We might be able to see the moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment of our lives . We would live differently . We would be different  --  more than human , maybe even better than human . " <p> Her cheeks were flushed . He wanted to touch her , but he knew better . <p> " It 's steam engine time , that 's all it is , " she said . " A handful of minds , working together , change our perception of the world . Does a tree falling unobserved in the forest make a sound ? Only if we believe that a tree is a tree , the ground is the ground , and a sound a vibration . Only if we believe together . " <p> " And someone who does n't believe gets denied a post-doc , " he said . <p> " It 's the twentieth century equivalent of being forced to drink hemlock , " she said , and flounced into the house . <p> He had n't turned on a light yet . Dylan sat in the dark , watching the fuzzy grayness slip over the entire living room . The cat slept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were piled on the coffee table , on the end tables , in the comer . He had been sitting in the dark too much , thinking perhaps that was when her ghost would arrive . <p> A light flipped on in the kitchen and he jumped . <p> " Jesus Christ , do n't you use lights anymore ? " <p> Ross . Ross had let himself in the back door . Dylan took a deep breath to ease the pounding of his heart . He reached up and flicked on a table lamp . <p> " In here , " he said . <p> Ross came through the dining room door , and stared at the living room . The cat curled into a tighter ball , hiding her eyes from the light . <p> " We need to get you out of here , " he said . " How about a movie ? " <p> Dylan shook his head . He did n't need distractions now . He felt like he was very close . Her papers held little illuminating , but his memories  --  they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a picture . As if she had given him the answer out of order , and he had to piece it together . Alone . <p> " Okay , " Ross said , slumping into the sofa . " How about a beer ? " <p> The cat sat up and looked at Ross , then jumped off the couch . Dylan wished he could be as rude . <p> " I want to be alone , right now , " he said . <p> " You 've been alone since the end of August . Lock yourself up in here long enough , and you 'll never get over her . " <p> " I do n't want to get over her , " Dylan said . <p> Ross shrugged . " Wrong choice of words . You got your own life , and the last thing Geneva would have done was to want you to stop living because of her . " <p> " I 'm still living , " Dylan said . " I 'm still thinking . " <p> " Not good enough . " Ross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chair , and held it out . <p> Dylan looked at it and sighed . Then he rubbed a hand over his face . " Sit down , " he said . <p> Ross sat , still holding Dylan 's coat . He rested on the edge of the couch , as if he were about to jump up at any point . <p> " When Geneva and I went to Alaska , some friends of ours took us to a glacier . We went up in the mountains , saw this fantastic lake , filled with ice bergs , and at the edge of the lake , the tip of the glacier . A boat took us right there , and we could see geologic history being made . " <p> " I remember , " Ross said . His tone was dry  --  get to the point , Dylan - and he clutched the coat tighter . " You told me when you got back . " <p> " But I did n't tell you about the exhibit . One of those museum things , where they showed you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or so . It receded so much that the point where we stood at the edge of the lake had been glacier only 150 years before . That sucker was moving fast . Geneva stayed inside , where it was warm , but I went back out , and put my feet where that glacier had been a hundred years ago . And if I closed my eyes , I could feel it . I knew what it was like in the past ; it was as if it was still there , only half a step away , and I could get to it , if I took the right step . " <p> Ross leaned back on the couch , the coat covering him like a blanket . " When Gary died , " he said , " I used to go in his bedroom and pick up one of those models he worked so hard on . And if I held it just right , at the right time of night , I could feel his little warm hand under mine . Dinah would just watch me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was jealous  --  Gary shows up for Ross , but not me kinda thing . But she was worried about losing me too . She was afraid I would never come out of it . I still miss him , Dylan . I see another man with a six-year-old boy and it knocks the wind out of me . But I survived , and I moved on , and we have Linny now , and she 's precious too . " <p> " You 're telling me this is another phase ? " <p> " No . " Ross was twisting the coat sleeve in his hands . " I 'm telling you I finally know how she felt . Dylan , give yourself a chance to heal . Geneva will always be part of your past , but not part of your future . " <p> " What makes you so sure , " Dylan asked , " that they 're all that different ? " <p> GENEVA RESTED on her stomach , knees bent , feet crossed at the ankles . She held a blade of grass between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , trying to make a sound . The summer sun was hot , and the humidity was high . Wisconsin in the summer . Dylan could n't wait to leave . <p> " Did you know that Mormons marry not just for life , but for all eternity ? " <p> " You saying we should incorporate that into our vows ? " Dylan rolled on his back , feeling the grass tickle his shoulders . <p> " I wonder if we wo n't be doing that already . " She put her thumbs to her mouth , a blade of grass stretched between them . As she blew , it made a weak raspberry sound . " I mean , if you look at an event like you look at a pebble , falling into a pond , the action will create ripples that will stretch out from the pebble . Each event has its own ripple , independent of another ripple  --  " <p> " Unless they collide , " Dylan said with a leer . <p> " Unless they collide , " she repeated , ignoring his meaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pebble gets dropped , you ca n't go back to the same spot and watch it get dropped over and over again . You can in video tape , why not in life ? " <p> " Because life does n't have rewind and fast forward , " he said . <p> " Who says ? Time is just perception , Dylan . " <p> He rolled to his side , kissed her bare shoulder , and draped an arm across her back . From his perspective , the blade of grass between her fingers looked ragged and damp . " So you 're saying you might perceive that you 're marrying me for eternity , and I might perceive that I 'm marrying you for Wednesday . So I could turn around and marry someone else for Thursday  --  " <p> " Only if you get a divorce first . " She threw away the blade of grass . " Legalities , remember ? Other people 's perceptions . " <p> "  --  and you would still think you 're married to me forever , right ? " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said , leaning her head into him . Her hair smelled of the sun . He kissed her crown . <p> She turned , so that she was pressed flush against him , warm skin against his . " But when you say you 'll love me for eternity , you mean it , right ? " <p> He leaned in , his face almost touching hers . He could n't imagine life without her . " When I say I 'll love you forever , " he said , " I mean it with all my heart . " <p> The dean 's office was on the second floor of Erskine Hall , where the senior professors resided . Dylan used to aspire to walking that staircase every day . Then he would have had tenure , been able to stay in Oregon until he retired . He used to imagine that he and Geneva would buy a beach house . They would work in the city , then drive the hour to the beach each weekend . They would sit outside , on a piece of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ocean . Geneva would contemplate the universe , and Dylan would contemplate her . <p> Dreams . Even dreams were ghost limbs . Moments , frozen in time and space . <p> He walked down the narrow corridors , past the rows of crammed offices , filled with too many books and stacks of student papers . The dean 's office was a little larger , and it had a reception area , usually staffed by upperclassmen . This time , though , the receptionist was gone . <p> He knocked on the gray metal door . " Nick ? " <p> " Come on in , Dylan , and close the door . " <p> Dylan did as he was asked , and sat on the ancient upholstered chair in front of Nick 's desk . Students probably felt like they 'd walked in hell 's anteroom when they came here . Everything was decorated early ' 70s , in browns and burnt orange . <p> Nick was a white-haired man in his late fifties , face florid with too much food and stress . " I 'm sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit . I never expected to outlive someone like her . " <p> Dylan made himself smile . " My mother said she was like a flare , brief but beautiful . " <p> " You do n't believe that , " Nick said . <p> Dylan took a deep breath . " You did n't call me in here to talk about Geneva . " <p> " Actually , I did . Indirectly . " Nick stood up , and shoved his hands in his pockets , stretching out his pants like a clown 's , and making his potbelly pool out . Geneva used to call him Chuckles when he did that , a comment made all the better by the fact that the gesture meant Nick was going to say something difficult . " Word is that you 've been acting a bit erratic lately . Letting classes out early , missing meetings , spouting spontaneous philosophy in the halls . " <p> " Does n't sound like the crime of the century , " Dylan said , then bit his lip . Defensive . He could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not even all that unusual  --  except for you , Dylan . You were always consistent and quiet . I 'm not saying you 're doing anything wrong , but your wife just died . I wanted you to take the term off , but you insisted on working , and I 'm not sure that was such a good idea . " <p> Dylan stared at him for a moment , uncertain how to respond . <p> It begins with little complaints , Geneva once told him . Maybe your clothes are a little unusual , or you do n't conduct class according to the right methods . Then , one day , you wake up and find you 've been imprisoned for your beliefs . <p> He opened his mouth , closed it again , and thought . The classes meant nothing this term . The students , merely full-sized reminders of how much time had passed since he had sat in their chairs , since he had met Geneva . <p> " You 're right , " he said . " I think I should take a leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Nick turned , pulled his hands out of his pockets , and frowned . Obviously he had n't expected Dylan to acquiesce so easily . " Sure it wo n't leave you alone too much ? " <p> Dylan smiled and shrugged . " I 'm not sure I 'm really alone now , " he said . <p> Toward the end , she had shrunk to half her size , her skin so translucent , he could see her veins . The hospital room had deep blue walls , a bed with restraints on it , and a television perched in the comer . The restraints were down , the television off , and the window open , casting sunlight against the awful blue . <p> Dylan sat beside the bed every day , from the moment visiting hours began until the moment they ended . At noon on August 23rd , she opened her eyes and found his . Her gaze was clear for the first time in three days , for the first time since he had brought her to the hospital . <p> " Dylan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> He took her too-small hand . It no longer fit just right in his . " I 'm here , Geneva . " <p> " You know those two tiny beings on the lake equivalent ? " Each word was an effort . He leaned forward so that he could hear her . Her grip was tight in his . " I think in about eight minutes , they 're going to see a supernova . " <p> She closed her eyes . He could n't hear her breathing . He pushed the nurse call button , once , twice , then three times . <p> The grip in his hand tightened . Geneva was looking at him , a small smile on her face . " Do n't mourn , Dylan , " she said . " Forever , remember ? " <p> " I remember , " he said , but by that time , she had loosened her grip on his hand . The nurses came in , with their equipment and needles , pushing him aside . He watched as they checked her , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her pulse . One of them turned to him , and shook her head . He shoved his hands in his pockets and walked out of the room , a much poorer man than he had been when he entered . <p> On All Hallow 's Eve , he packed his car to the light of the single streetlight . During the afternoon , he had taken the cat over to Ross 's , explaining that he was going on a short trip , and was n't sure when he would be back . He waited until dark , packed the car , and headed west . <p> He had awakened with the idea , the jigsaw puzzle complete in his mind . He knew how to find her , and how they could be together , forever , as she had said . As he drove over the Coast Range , the puzzle became clearer ; the answer seemed right . Steam engine time , she had said . But who would have thought that a philosophy professor would be the first to ride the rails ? <p> Geneva had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the mind . <p> He pulled into the public beach at Lincoln City , grabbed a blanket and a cooler from the back of the car , and walked to the loose sand . He was careful to sit on a driftwood log , untouched by high tide . <p> Geneva called the point where the sea met the sky infinity . In the dark , it seemed even more vast than it did in the day . He put the blanket on the sand , set the cooler to the side , and leaned on the driftwood log . <p> He managed to arrive on the dark side of the moon . The night sky was full of stars , points of light , points of history . To their friends , these stars could be dead , but to him , they lived , and twinkled , and smiled for one last show . His mind could grasp each point of light , see it for what it was , and for its pattern , feel the backdrop of blackness against it and beyond . <p> The ocean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , he heard Geneva 's voice talking about sound and waves , waves and sound . Inspiting , she had said , and so it was . <p> The edge of the universe was just beyond his imagination . The whole universe was within his grasp . He did n't want to see the big bang or the end of everything . He did n't want to see all of time , nor all of time and space . Only those points of light that were Geneva , from her birth to her death and back again . He wanted to hold all of those points in his mind at the same time , to be lying with her on the dock at the same time he sat here alone , to be holding her hand in the hospital while they played at intellectual foreplay in her dorm . He wanted his mind to be like the sky , holding history , the future , and infinity at the same time . <p> Geneva . <p> She was out there , in time and space , each moment of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cast his mind into the inky blackness  --  <p>  --  and felt the barriers break . <p> <p> By Kristine Kathryn Rusch <p> In addition to the stories that have been published here , Kristine Kathryn Rusch has sold short fiction to most of the sf magazines , and a number of anthologies .
