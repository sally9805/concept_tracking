After a year 's absence , Michael Cassutt returns to our July issue . His stunning , understated science fiction has been a staple of the July issues through the nineties . <p> Michael 's short fiction is a rarity . He spends much of his time working in Hollywood , most recently on Strange Luck . The seed for this story was planted when Michael was driving home from Vancouver after leaving the Outer Limits . He stopped in Eugene , and we discussed the kinds of fiction no one was writing any more  --  including the future-of-space science fiction . I said Michael was uniquely qualified to write it , since he co-wrote non-fiction with Buzz Aldrin . Michael took me up on the challenge , and the result is " The Longer Voyage . " <p> The Last Time Julian Tallet visited Node Canaveral for maintenance Ulrich Charz was Mission Administrator , Mission Population was officially two thousand , three hundred , and initial operating capacity was eight years away . Since then Julian had aged six years : the new M.A. was Alf Riordan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand , and initial operating capacity was twelve years away . Two improvements , two deteriorations . <p> " I like the air here , " Ty said from the driver 's seat , and promptly sneezed . <p> Julian did n't , though he felt like sneezing , too . He rarely thought about the air , except when he happened to see Hong Kong videos about skullduggery on Mission in which nobody ever sneezed . Mission 's air filtration system had been under review since the first nodes were opened , but space dwellers had been sneezing an average of a hundred times a day since Mir , a century back . <p> Julian did n't have Ty 's sensitivities even though both were gen twos  --  born on Mission . Ty was developmentally challenged and looked like a concept for an advanced human being as imagined during the early Space Age : long , spindly arms and legs , pale complexion , head too large for his body . Mission Personnel officially deployed him as a " therapeutic test subject " and paid him a salary , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make occasional observations . But , then , the citizens of the early Space Age would have called Mission a starship . And would have had it halfway to Alpha Cen by now . <p> " It smells like polin , " Julian said , finding it hard to put a label on the sensation through his general fog of ill health . <p> " What 's polin ? " <p> Julian pointed to the patch of green serving as an interface between the smooth silvery glaze of the " street " and the glassy vertical plate that hid the innards of the LockMart office just ahead . ( Mission Management types here in Node Canaveral had a taste for classic Earth styles . ) " It 's a grass-like vegetative matter , native to Kazakstan . Not edible . " Ty wore a read-only patch that would help him with words like " vegetative " and even " Kazakstan , " but it was important to add the business about lack of edibility . Especially when Ty got out of the cart and went to investigate . " Want some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to get comfortable . He was overdue for maintenance . His clothes were tight around the waist ; he hated to wake up in the morning . His hair was grayer every time he looked in a mirror . At the age of thirty-eight minus one day he was facing the fact that he was as good as he was going to get at anything you cared to name : deal-making or love-making . There had even been moments when he would have surrendered to integration , to allow Mission Personnel to deploy him to some nice job in Commercial Support , maybe . <p> The fact that he would even consider integration convinced him he had to risk maintenance . So now he lurked around a Node Canaveral contractor site , waiting for Duwayne to return from his face sweep of the maintenance center . Duwayne was fully integrated into the official Mission network as well as the many illegal and unregistered data bands that made up the undernet , but sometimes you just had to see things with your own eyes . <p> " Mr. Tallet ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and went to him . " Look what I found . " Ty was standing on the patch of polin and pointing to the window . It had been defaced with a large painted tag that said : " A.C. Death . " <p> The A.C. and the Death were joined by a smudge , probably some defining punctuation , even a short word such as or . Alpha Cen or Death . The only people on Mission who talked much about Alpha Cen were Management , and it pleased Julian to think of some frustrated Level E type expressing his rage at the eternal delays in this way . Nevertheless , Julian figured the tag was the work of a gen two , probably a boy about fourteen . It had a clear hand and cursive capitals , like something from an ancient handbook on penmanship . Lots of gen twos had taken up cursive writing as a way of communicating outside the net ; Julian carried his own pencil and notebook for the same reason . <p> Of course , for gen twos the missing punctuation would be an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's attention was drawn by Duwayne 's return . " Now there 's a nice job , " Duwayne said , nodding at the tag as he slipped into the back seat . " I 'm surprised Facilities has n't gotten to it . " <p> " Facilities probably likes graffiti . It 's Internal Affairs that will be interested . " <p> " I.A. probably left it there to catch the tagger , " Duwayne said . <p> " I.A. probably put it there in the first place to target subversives . " <p> Duwayne found this bit of paranoia amusing . He was compact , normal or even good-looking , but , like Ty , somehow incomplete . Whereas Ty had flaws in his genetic programming , Duwayne had simply developed a bad attitude . He was officially deployed to Agon Systems , one of the many Mission contractors , as a communications specialist . Since Julian currently consulted for Agon Systems , he had inherited Duwayne . <p> Ty returned to the cart as Julian asked Duwayne , " Are we clear ? " <p> It was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contractors . " Better yet , " Duwayne said . " Somebody did a sweep for us . I 'm looking at their plot now . It 's very tidy . " The cart zoomed out of the shadows and down the empty street toward maintenance . <p> " Who ? " <p> " Somebody from Management . " <p> The cart was a modified battery-powered tractor originally used to move cargo around the high bay in Node Baikonur . Crushed during one of the frequent spinquakes of years past , it had been written off until a Biker mechanic working for Julian had restored the body , replacing grappling gear with a stretched cab . It would hold four passengers , three of them comfortably . <p> No one on Mission truly required motorized transport : a walk of nine hundred meters in any axis would return you to the spot you started . Unfortunately , with the various node separators , not to mention lifts and hatchways , it was impossible to walk more than twenty meters in any direction . If you traveled a lot and occasionally delivered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handy . <p> The drive was a short one . No other vehicles were parked in front of maintenance  --  Management suits were officially required to travel on foot , though those that actually hewed to this rule were so few that Julian suspected he knew them all by name . And as he walked into maintenance he began to feel a bit nervous . <p> There were three sections to maintenance , one for emergencies , and one each for gen ones and gen twos , who had different requirements . " So , which one is he in ? " Julian asked Duwayne , meaning the person from Management . It was n't an entirely casual question . <p> " Gen Two section . " This bit of data narrowed the possible candidates to one , and Julian suddenly felt even worse . He turned to Duwayne . " Let 's make it another day . " <p> Duwayne returned from the undernet long enough to register surprise . " But we just got here ! They 're already loaded for you . " <p> " Let them reload @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomorrow ? " <p> Well , there was that . Before Julian could decide he saw that it was too late . The Management patient , already shaved and capped , was in the doorway , and there was no way to avoid a face . " Julian Tallet , " the man said . " I wondered what all the fuss was about . " He turned around , then paused : " Come on in . Do n't be shy . " <p> Offended by the man 's attitude  --  " I do n't care if he is Management ! "  --  Duwayne took a step toward him . <p> But Julian held him back . " It 's all right , " Julian said . " He 's my brother . " <p> *** <p> The two techs had not overtaxed themselves in helping Roy Tallet with his patches , but that changed the moment they saw Julian . Not only were they suddenly free with soothing words and attentions , but one of them managed to help Roy back to his table . " I should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 'll never convince me you did n't , " Julian said , taking his own place . <p> " So many edges , Julian , " Roy said , " in such a cylindrical world . " <p> To Julian this was no more accurate than most of Roy 's judgments . For one thing , Mission was not truly cylindrical , but more of a cake with layers of different shapes and diameters . Even the social model was something multi-dimensional . For another , Julian 's personality had fewer corners than did Roy 's . . . and Julian had the scans to prove it . But the new blood spurting into his veins was already having its mellowing effect . " You 're looking good , " was all he said to Roy . It almost killed him to admit it , but put the two of them side by side , and anyone would think Roy was younger . <p> " Management is generous with its maintenance plan . " Both men lay back and closed their eyes . " You could have the same schedule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> "  --  Accept integration . No , thank you . I like my privacy . " <p> " We have privacy . " Roy had accepted integration at the age of thirteen , when Julian was almost eleven . " Besides , that 's not the issue . It 's been twenty-five years since the divorce . You 're still punishing Dad for broken promises . " <p> Julian knew that Roy had used Mission net to pull up Julian 's personality scans  --  the one element of his life that was unavoidably integrated , since you could n't get maintained without being scanned . Not only was his medical data in Mission net , but also a wonderfully colored fractal-edged chart of his personality . Blue for the various intelligence and aptitude tests in addition to his grades in Mission 's school system . Green for physical data . Yellow for the blending of his parents ' scans . Red for personality map  --  and running through the latter two , like a regular goddamn Grand Canyon , was the black rift of his parent 's divorce . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two Tallet boys had turned out so differently . " It 's because of broken promises , " Julian said quietly . " But not Dad 's . " <p> Julian did not know when the International ExtraSolar SETI Response Initiative  --  better known as Mission  --  actually began . The official myth placed it immediately after the detection of mysterious signals from the tail of the constellation Southern Cross in Fiscal Year 2022 . Those signals had been " unscrambled " and " enhanced " in a variety of ways ; analysts had concluded that the signals consisted of either a " message " to the galaxy at large , or perhaps some sort of radio entertainment . Neither conclusion was universally accepted , though the fact of some signal-generating entity elsewhere in the ( relatively near ) galactic neighborhood was indisputable . Based on data from the Pickering series of probes ( F.Y. 2049-2061 ) the SETI source had been provisionally assigned the name " Eden . " Whether this was strictly true , Eden had the virtue of being much more Earthlike than any body in the solar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that Mission was born when it finally became clear , sometime in the Forties , that human beings were never going to be able to colonize Mars , not without significant reconstruction . ( On the humans , that is . The idea of actually modifying a whole planet had been consigned to the same historical dumpster as communism , ethnic harmony and free television . The existence of an apparently Earthlike world in orbit around the star Alpha Cen A provided a goal that promised greater return for less expense than rebuilding several thousand humans , even allowing for the awesome distance of eight light-years , which meant a transit time of forty-five years using the most advanced propulsion system then conceived , the Indonesian cryo-fusion burner . <p> Julian subscribed to a third myth , that the SETI signals were bogus and the entire Mission was a planetary pork barrel project , a means of redirecting excess capital into spinoff research and development . ( The global economy had gone through an unprecedented period of robustness in the Thirties , thanks to the death of the western baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finance for its entire seventy-five year run . ) <p> The original plan , baseline F.Y. 2039 , called for Mission to reach initial operating capacity  --  I.O.C.  --  on 1 October 2086 , with injection into a trans-Alpha trajectory to follow in that fiscal year . Julian Tallet was born on Mission in F.Y. 2074 , when I.O.C. was holding firm at F.Y. 2086 , when there was a chance that while Julian and the other gen twos would spend twenty or more years of their life in transit , they would still walk on the shores of Eden . <p> F.Y. 2086 came and went without I.O.C. , without departure for Alpha Cen . At the age of eighteen Julian was selected for the flight operations track , and all his schooling from that point on concerned orbital mechanics , simulator technologies and program management , since the design of the actual Eden landing craft would not be frozen until Mission reached the new world . As part of his flight training he was also allowed to don wings and flap around the high bay in Bike under low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mission pilot , knowing he would be in his forties before he got a chance to use his skill . Then the cryo-fusion system designed to be installed on Mission blew up during final qualification tests , irradiating the entire Cape York test center , and killing three hundred and eleven people . <p> I.O.C. slipped from " next year " to a minimum of eight years when the Level A managers in Munich switched from cryo-fusion to an older technology called SteadiState , and the projected transit time , low Earth orbit to low Eden orbit , increased from twenty-five to sixty years . Even allowing for the possible Lorenz-Fitzgerald stretching of lifespan , Julian and the other gen twos realized they had no chance of ever walking on Eden . At the rate things were going , they would be lucky to live long enough to see departure . <p> " You should have stayed in Management and done something about it . " <p> " You were smarter than me , Roy . If you could n't fix things , what was I supposed to do ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hannah ? " <p> " Fine . Her branch is in charge of this burn . " Roy hesitated , then said , " How about Sophie ? " <p> " I do n't know , " Julian said , carefully . He and Sophie had been together for two years , the same amount of time he had worked with Agon Systems . He had noticed a depressing pattern in his life  --  one relationship per job . All Julian knew was that this breakup had been the most painful yet . With Sophie he had begun to allow himself to consider marriage , children . Most of his friends ( a group which did not include Ty or Duwayne ) had chanced one or the other ; some both . Julian had begun to feel left out . <p> But then he remembered his own rage at learning of his own life sentence aboard Mission . He did not want to be target of that sort o.f rage from his own children . He had made that clear to Sophie . Who was now gone . <p> Now he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " How are you doing for money ? " <p> This was another sore subject . Theoretically every gen two  --  every person officially listed as a member of Population  --  had a deployment and a salary . The salaries were subject to mandatory deductions for base habitation , facilities use ( including air ) , medical maintenance and diet . You 'd have to try hard to starve aboard Mission , but the salary actually left little for what Management termed elective/quality of life purchases . Julian had gotten into trouble that way in the past , charging against his salary until Finance stopped him . Several times he had had to go to Roy for money , though not lately . <p> " I 'm keeping ahead , " Julian replied . " I realize I still owe you . . . " <p> Roy waved that off , which infuriated Julian even more than having it brought up in the first place . " I figured you 'd be able to make money at Agon . " He sighed . " Everybody does . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They 're bad guys , Julian . " <p> " They 're licensed contractors , Roy . " <p> " They 're the next best thing to Mafia  --  " Suddenly aware that every tech in maintenance was eagerly listening , Roy shut up . <p> Searching for some way to salvage the conversation , Julian said , " I 'm having a party tomorrow night . My birthday . " <p> " I know , " Roy said . " I 'm still your brother . " <p> " Why do n't you bring Hannah , if you can get her to go south of Korou ? " <p> " We have a burn scheduled . " <p> " There 's never been a burn in Mission history that took place on time . " <p> " Julian . . . I did n't come here to pick a fight . " That they would fight was inevitable . They were gen two kids , the children of the hated contractors who had fought their way into Management . But while Julian had quit , Roy had risen all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had compounded the insult by marrying a woman from a Management family , too . Julian turned his head and looked directly at Roy , amazed at how much he resembled their father . <p> Now Roy said , " You and your . . . associates would n't be trying to bias the burn in any way . " <p> There was always a pool on Mission events . " Since when do you care about the leisure activities of the underclass ? " <p> " Whenever it affects Mission safety . " <p> " Is this an official inquiry ? " <p> " Do you have any official data ? " <p> Julian wished again that Roy had skipped law school . " Here 's what I can tell you : if there are any friendly , private wagers on private networks  --  did I mention the word ' private ' ? " <p> Roy had the grace to smile . " I believe so . " <p> " They are reactive , not proactive . To put it another way , nobody is trying to fix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was really just asking . " <p> Julian was surprised at his own vehemence . Because for the first time in his two years with Agon , he realized he did n't know the answer to Roy 's question . <p> Roy smiled faintly . " I 'm going to try to get to your party . " He rolled his shoulder . " You 'd think with all the maintenance we 've had , we 'd be in better shape . " <p> " For human beings a world this small is toxic . " <p> " Come on , Julian . We designed it . " <p> " Maybe you did . " Then he lay back and let the sweet new blood flow . For a brief moment , at this point in the very long , never really begun voyage , A.C. did n't equal death . <p> Mission was theoretically self-sufficient , with air , water and waste purified and recycled for an indefinite period , assuming strict Population control , though most Red Team simulations suggested that eighty years was a more realistic system life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eco system would sustain itself for at least that long , which was still beyond the maximum allowable duration for the trans-Alpha voyage . ( In some simulations the optimum system lifetime actually allowed for a round trip - 160 years  --  providing , of course , that Population decreased . ) Renewable resources had already been detected on Eden early in the design process so that refueling at Alpha Cen was the primary mode , while a closed system with return was only a backup . <p> Eco was an in-house Management program in which Agon Systems was the major subcontractor . This fit nicely with the company 's role in Facilities , which was collecting garbage . With Population constantly changing not to mention the on-going construction and repairs , garbage was a serious problem . Scrap metal and composites could be redeployed to the Fabrik program , Mission 's own manufacturing arm . But everything else , from plain old litter to discarded toys to dust in the air had to be tracked , retrieved , and dealt with . <p> Julian did n't have an office ; Agon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so most mornings found Julian planted at a table to the rear of the Seagull , a care that catered to Bikers . With his laptop and Duwayne nearby Julian monitored the endless flow of Mission debris . He also monitored various cargo manifests , Mission or informal , controlling the flow of materials , information and people into and out of the high bay . The challenge was knowing how much of a shipment was capable of being " lost " or " damaged , " and who to compensate , and with what . <p> Mission did much of its own processing , turning chemicals into composites , and sometimes the other way around . But there was a gratifying percentage of the Population which was still willing to pay for exotic food from Earth . . . fashions . . . hardware . . . data . ( Information and entertainment were beamed directly aboard , though Management controlled the intra-Mission network . ) Software judged violent , subversive or otherwise incorrect was subject to censorship ; Julian was happy to shift it to the undernet . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ docked , one of ten officially manifested resupply flights per year . It was n't until after lunch that Julian was able to ask Duwayne to go up on Mission net . " Tell me about this SteadiState propulsion event . " <p> Duwayne blinked , then came back into focus . " It 's been in development since F.Y. 9.5 or so , originally intended for constant-boost outer planet missions . Abandoned . " <p> " Because of technical problems ? " <p> " Fiscal . SteadiState 's just too expensive . There were some instabilities during its initial use . . . one loss of vehicle in F.Y. 79 contributed to replacement by another system . " <p> " Anything anywhere to show that it 's not a good idea ? Red Team reports ? " <p> " Nothing on Mission . " <p> " Well . Is it going to light up on time ? " <p> " It 's running two hours late . " <p> Julian stood up . That was typical . " Duwayne . . . do you ever wonder what you 'd do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean , if we actually got to departure ? " <p> " Yeah . " <p> Duwayne mulled this for a moment , his consciousness spread over God knew what pages of the nets , then smiled . " You 're kidding , right ? Mission 's never going to go anywhere . " <p> " Suppose it did . Suppose they stopped the resupply flights and kicked out everybody who was n't in Population . Buttoned her up and said , ' Next stop is Alpha Cen . . . sixty years . ' " ' <p> " I 'd be on the last flight down . " <p> " Do n't want to see Eden ? " <p> " I 've seen it from Pickering . " He nodded toward the view of dayside Africa rolling past on the television . " It looks like that , only colder . " <p> " You 've been here your whole life . What are you going to do downstairs ? " <p> " I do n't know . But at least I wo n't be off-line . " Duwayne was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of his waking moments  --  probably his dreaming ones , too  --  awash in data and imagery . For him , trying to live without the nets would be like trying to live without air . Which was reason number three that Julian had never accepted integration . Duwayne said , " My parents signed up to go to Alpha Cen , not me . It 's not my fault they died before they got their chance . " He smiled . " A.C. equals death . " <p> Julian realized that a lot of gen twos agreed with Duwayne , yet the attitude suddenly annoyed him . " Duwayne , you 've never been cold . Never been rained on . They have weather downstairs . They have dirt . The Mission 's a pretty small town , too . How would you like to be sharing space with ten million people ? I bet you would n't last five minutes in Munich . " <p> " I bet I wo n't have to . " <p> " Did you put anything into this burn pool ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the books . " <p> He could n't believe the words were coming out of his mouth . Not because they were n't true , but because he did n't really want to pick on Duwayne . " Ah , let 's get ready for a party . " <p> Julian lived minus-x-ward of Node Canaveral in Node Palmachim , the oldest residential volume on Mission , one plus-x from Bike . It was probably safer there than in the heavily patrolled Management node , especially for Julian , who had many supportive friends , but its drawback was that it was ugly , nothing but a hilly street of warehouses scarred by collisions with Bike haulers and marked by forty years of tags . <p> Assuming that Sophie would not show up , Julian had allowed Duwayne to invite as many female " visitors " as he wanted  --  which turned out to be a trio of entertainers who said they were planning to head back downstairs to Branson , Missouri , any day now . <p> He sent Ty with the cart to pick up Roy and Hannah ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hannah 's regrets . " She 's on the trajectory panel and does n't want to miss the countdown . " <p> Just as well : Julian had not seen Hannah since the wedding . A Management female would n't know what to say to someone like him . <p> Roy examined the volume . He did not need a calculator to judge its size . " I think I 'm going to let you pay me back after all , " he told Julian . " You have three times the volume Dr. Riordan has . " Riordan was Mission Administrator , the highest Level C manager on site . <p> " I thought Management principles mandated equal volume for all . " <p> " Several years ago two guys in D offered to give up their volume to enlarge the M.A. 's suite . " <p> " He 's got all those meetings to hold . . . " <p> " It was seen to be quite a noble gesture . " <p> " And what happened to them , Roy ? " <p> " One of them is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about my business . " Julian nodded at one of the hostesses , who brought over the tray of drinks . Julian helped himself as Roy looked them over carefully . " If you do n't see anything you like , name it and I 'll get it . " When Roy continued to hesitate , Julian realized what the problem was . " I guess Management does n't want its integrated managers to be substance abusers . They must really track you all the time . " <p> Roy picked up a clear drink . " Not all the time . " He clinked glasses clumsily with Julian . " Happy birthday . " <p> Julian watched Roy scan the crowd  --  not a large one , in spite of the available volume . It was still rather early in the evening for Mission 's underclass to be out . The crowd was evenly split between men over thirty years of age and women under . " Amazing , " Roy finally said . " Most of your guests do n't appear to exist . Population ca n't match any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them are visitors . " <p> " Visitors have their own category in Population , Julian . How do they stay maintained ? Mission wo n't cover you if you 're not in Population . If you have n't been officially deployed . " <p> Julian shrugged . " Maybe Mission 's database is n't as comprehensive as it 's supposed to be . Clearly everybody here is maintained  --  " <p> "  --  And they all appear to be working . " Roy shook his head . " It 's quite an operation you have here . " <p> " I ca n't take credit for it . " <p> " I was n't going to give you credit . I just said it was amazing . " <p> Julian busied himself for a moment by accepting a second drink , or was it his third ? " Roy . . . you said something yesterday that was interesting . " <p> " About how you 're still punishing Dad ? " <p> This was worse than asking Roy for money . All the worse because Julian did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more likely , with access to Agon Systems , was going to screw up the burn . But having been a part of this operation for two years now , he had learned to trust his instincts , especially when it came to events like this . And his instincts were telling him there was influence . <p> But what did he want Roy to do ? Unleash Internal Affairs ? Agon would never allow that , and the moment they discovered Julian 's involvement ( and they would ) , he was in big trouble . It was one thing to play games with Management and Personnel : getting Agon mad at you was a form of suicide . Julian might have to move downstairs . He might be lucky to survive to make the move . <p> " What you said about getting into Management . " <p> Roy must have stared at him for a full five seconds . " That 's a surprise . Integration and all ? " <p> " I do n't know about that . I just said  --  " <p> "  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> "  --  That I was interested in what you said . " Neither one of them was going to make the first concession . " Look , forget it . " <p> " Not a chance . I 'm fascinated . Something really big must have happened since this afternoon , to make my kid brother give up the glamorous life of gambling , drugs and smuggling  --  " <p> That did it . " Climb down from the pedestal , Roy . Mission runs its lotteries , manufactures its own drugs and makes sure Managers have first pick . The import-export laws change everytime somebody in Munich sneezes . Some of us do n't fit in Mission . We 're just making our own world . " <p> " Which looks a lot like the bad one we left behind . " <p> Julian nodded toward the television . Blue and brown , Earth rolled past , three hundred miles below . " You have n't managed to leave yet . " <p> Pleading fatigue , Roy left after an acceptable hour 's attendance , at which point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intended to honor him so much as it was a chance for his associates to eat and drink for free . He had begun to pay attention to one of the Branson singers , a woman named Hope , when Duwayne found him . " Sorry to bother you , " he said . " I.A. " <p> Julian removed Hope from his lap . " Here ? " <p> " The Seagull . " Duwayne fell back into the net for a moment , then surfaced : " It 's two Internal Affairs teams  --  must be up from Munich , since they 're not in Population . " <p> Julian was already stepping over his more persistent party-goers on the way out the door . Duwayne struggled to walk while staying up on Mission . " What are they doing ? " <p> Another pause . " Facing Ty and his people . Picking stuff up . " <p> " Any activity on either net ? " <p> " Mission 's devoted to that burn , now at T-minus-six hours . Undernet has the usual . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to the cart and headed for the access point that would take them across to Node Baikonur . <p> Mission had a unique legal status . No nation or group of nations had any sovereignty over it . Originally its model was Antarctica , an " open " center for research . But habitation at the Antarctic stations was limited ; people went home after their tours . There was no permanent population . <p> During the early assembly phase Mission was treated as a commercial facility , like an ocean-oil platform , except that the " corporation " which funded Mission was a consortium of nations , some of whom were virulently opposed to commercial ventures . Again , commercial facilities did not have permanent residents . <p> All through the development and assembly phases there were popular stories  --  even a couple of Hong Kong movies  --  about Mission becoming an independent nation , with its own laws , currency , government . It was the kind of thing gen twos talked about when they were in their early teens and forgot about when they started having sex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , legally , no such thing . Julian and Roy , for example , were technically citizens of the United States , since that was what their parents were . Never mind that Julian had come no closer to the U.S. than a vertical separation of at least two hundred and fifty miles ; he had the right to return there as a voting citizen . The same applied to the rest of Population . <p> Only when Mission burned out of orbit on a trans-Alpha Cen trajectory would it begin moving toward any kind of actual independence . From what Julian had heard , when he bothered to pay attention , Management was still struggling to address the form of this government , and the transition to it . <p> In practical terms , however , Mission was technically a free port . The only laws were Management directives , and in at least one international court case these had been shown to be quite limited , dealing mostly with Mission property  --  in effect , Management could enforce directives only among its actual employees . Other members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , could abide by or ignore the directives as they chose , subject only to possible loss of contract with Management . <p> Agon Systems , the corporation , preferred its own rules . As far as it was concerned , there were no Sunday closing laws . No casino or liquor licenses . No censorship . And Management 's Internal Affairs staff was only an annoyance . <p> There were three of them in the Seagull when Julian and Duwayne arrived , two men and a woman , visitors as far as Julian knew . " What do you think you 're doing here ? " Julian said . <p> " Searching for stolen Mission property , " the woman snapped . <p> " Have you been authorized by Agon Systems ? " Julian said . <p> One of the men was already shoving a pass in front of Julian 's nose . Julian glanced at Duwayne , who could only shrug . Apparently they had gotten somebody in the company to allow them access . Well , Agon Systems was so large it was often at war with its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . <p> Ty was in a state . " Ca n't we make them leave ? " <p> " Sure . But they 'll fight and then someone will get hurt . " And that would mean more dealing with maintenance and Management and , worst of all , Agon Systems ' insurance directorate . Even Ty knew what that meant . <p> " Look out ! " Duwayne shouted , as a shelf unit suddenly got detached from the wall and fell crashing to the floor . One of the I.A. goons stepped over it , crunching a collection of data disks . " Mr. Tallet , you 've got to stop this ! " <p> Julian was already reaching for the phone . " Roy ? Julian . " He had n't expected Roy to be home in bed with Hannah , and he was n't . He was at what looked to be mission operations . " I see you got your second wind . " <p> " You did n't call to give me a hard time about leaving the party . " <p> " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want them out of here . " <p> " I do n't have anything to do with Internal Affairs . Management sees it as a conflict , since I have relatives with bad associates . " <p> Julian glanced at Duwayne , who was monitoring the conversation on Mission . He shrugged . " He 's telling the truth . He does n't have control or even access . " <p> " Then let 's just call it a coincidence . You get in touch with me for the first time in years . . . then this raid happens the night of the big burn . " <p> " You made this choice , " Roy snapped . He looked truly angry . " You 've bounced from one goddamn disaster to another because , I do n't know , somebody disappointed you . Well , maybe it 's time to grow up . Your actions have consequences . You chose to work with Agon Systems  --  let them take care of you . " <p> " I 'll do that , " Julian said . And broke the connection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ options ? " <p> " Regarding ? " <p> " Biasing their burn . " <p> Duwayne smiled for the first time since Julian had known him . " We 're pretty well insinuated into their nets . There 's a pre-loaded virus that will infect flight control systems , then commit suicide after ten generations . " <p> " What would it do to their burn ? " <p> " Let 's just say there wo n't be a bum . Not on time , anyway . Not today . " <p> " Then do it . " Let Management decide what it really wanted , a clean Mission or a Mission that worked . Julian started to walk away , but turned back . " And when you do , make sure I make a lot of money , will you ? " <p> Before Duwayne finished speaking , the three I.A. people came out of the Seagull . " Find what you were looking for ? " Julian asked . <p> " Fuck you , " the woman said , as the three of them walked off , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found Hope still waiting . Well , he had expected that . Their love-making sputtered out when he discovered that she was as fully integrated as Duwayne . Without the boost the undernet could give her , she hardly seemed interested . This had the advantage of making it easy for her to get over her annoyance , however . She managed to ask Julian how he could stand it , not being integrated ? How did he know anything ? " I listen . I see . " <p> " I 'd feel terribly alone . " <p> " I like to be alone . " And a few moments later , he was . <p> Sleep did n't come easily . Julian kept feeling that things had gotten out of control . . . that he had dropped a bomb . After all , Management periodically decided it was time to " clean up " Baikonur , and made punitive moves against Agon Systems ' people . Given the lack of actual laws , Management 's main weapon was to " redeploy " people to jobs which had minimal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were in Population . . . but the lure of full maintenance caused a steady stream of applicants for integration . Julian and Duwayne and Ty would have to spend months re-redeploying them while the business of their business suffered . Which was exactly what Management wanted . <p> But until now Management had never actually sent out I.A. to take possession of records or property . Add that to Roy 's reappearance in Julian 's life , and the SteadiState burn . . . Julian wondered if Management wanted him off Mission . <p> People moved downstairs , of course . Julian and Roy 's father , followed a few years later by their mother . The move had probably killed them both . Downstairs cultures continued to mutate , diverging from Mission 's more and more every year . Even accepting full integration into the central nets did n't mean you would fit . Your scans would never match . You would have no real friends , no social set other than other exiles , and no skills that applied . <p> No , if Management wanted him off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To hell with Alpha Cen ; he was trying to save his life . <p> Shortly after four-thirty in the morning he came awake  --  terrified . His room was absolutely black , something he 'd never seen or imagined . And he was floating . <p> He tried to slow his breathing , to clear his mind . Spin was off , that was probably the initial lurch which woke him . Power , too , which meant that lights were off , and more importantly , so was the environmental control system . <p> No fans . No fresh air . <p> Well , he figured he would n't suffocate in the next few minutes . He had drifted to one of the Y-axis walls . . . he could feel the bed , which was attached to the floor , below him at a right angle . Reaching to his left he found the door , and pulled himself through . <p> Julian experienced zero-G every time he moved from one node to the other , so the sensations were not new . The darkness and chaos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a door in what should have been the floor . He pushed himself toward it and managed to unlock it . He paused a moment before going out . . . partly to spatially orient himself . . . feet toward the street . Partly to wonder whether Hope had made it back to her Bike hotel  --  and if she had , whether that was a good idea . Partly to grab a headlamp from the emergency pack near the door . ( He had to blow the dust off it , and the LED showed it would only be good for an hour or so . ) <p> And where the hell was Duwayne ? <p> In the quarter-light of the emergencies , the street was surprisingly crowded with people braced in doorways . More bodies that did n't show in Population . Julian did n't know any of them . Wrappers , chunks of fiber , and pieces of wall floated past , including one bearing the front half of an ancient tag  --  Alpha Cen , period . Alpha Cen sucks ? Alpha Cen is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> He hauled himself over to the next doorway , where a heavy woman huddled with a little boy . The woman seemed stunned . " I think Mission 's down , " the boy said , looking worried . He was too young for integration , but now that Julian looked at the woman , the signs of withdrawal were clear . She did n't appear to be otherwise injured . <p> " What 's your name ? " he said . <p> She mouthed a reply : " Dolores . " So she could hear . Yet she was frightened to death because the voices and pictures in her head had gone silent . <p> Julian turned to the boy . " What 's your name ? " <p> " Sam . " <p> " Stay with your mother , Sam . Pretty soon they 'll have power back on . Keep your feet on the street in case the spin comes on , too . " Sam nodded as Julian pushed further down the street . <p> Suddenly something blotted out the emergency light above him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bumping gently against a sign that said " oftware . " He pulled himself up to it , and found Duwayne flopping in the front seat . Tugging Duwayne around , he saw that he was alive , but sobbing . " Hang on , " he told him . <p> He knew he needed to get the cart righted and back on the street . Just being this high up , relative to the street , with a half-ton mass sitting next to him , made him nervous . He wished he had some of the people he 'd worked with in the bays  --  for a whole year he had maneuvered containers like this all day long . <p> Bracing himself , he grabbed the rack over the rear battery and slowly began to turn the whole thing over . He had it halfway over when the main lights came on . He wanted to cheer . Of course , that also meant that the big air vents went back into operation , and he felt himself swaying in a sudden breeze . <p> Suddenly he knew he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> He tried to tell himself he did n't need to hurry . . . it would take minutes for rates to build up , for any real gravity to return . But there was a growing clatter of floating furniture , cookware , God knew what else , all colliding as air currents swept them together . He turned , rebraced , waited . Turned again , lost his grip , found it . Rebraced . <p> The cart was upright , and Duwayne was trying to get out . " Do n't move ! " Julian snapped . Too late : Duwayne 's movements wrenched the cart out of Julian 's grip . He floated one way while the cart went the other , both of them in a gentle tumble . The cart cracked into the building across the street while Julian bumped his head on the sky . Feeling somewhat more at home in near-G now , he pushed himself back toward the street . <p> He was just in time to see the cart settle slowly and gently on its right side as gravity returned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let 's straighten this out while we still can . " Duwayne helped him right the cart , then stood there chattering as Julian looked it over for damage . One side panel had crumpled ; the forward frame appeared bent . Julian hit the ignition , however , and heard the reassuring hum . " You and Ty did a good job on this , " he told Duwayne . " What happened ? " <p> Duwayne blinked . " It 's hard to say . Mission 's down . Undernet , too  --  " <p> " I know . " <p> " I think it was the SteadiState unit , something about a burnthrough that started the whole stack going asymmetrical . " Julian remembered some disaster scenario from school long-ago , how carefully the dynamics of the many moving parts of Mission needed to be kept in balance . A sudden burst of propulsion from an unexpected angle would be troublesome , possibly disastrous . <p> " That would explain loss of spin , but not the blackout , or the networks going down . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had . I 've got nothing but static since then . " He rubbed his eyes . " It 's weird . Quiet . " To Julian 's ears , full of the growing drone of voices , vents , and occasional crashes , it was anything but quiet . " What should we do ? " <p> Julian got behind the wheel of the cart . " Let 's see if we ca n't fix something . " As they drove off Julian saw a graffito remnant : no Alpha Cen , no linking symbol , just " Death . " <p> The bottle that was Mission architecture was in fact several different structures that , as the joke had it , only happened to be in the same place at the same time . The neck of the bottle was the propulsion tower ; the body was made up of six different flattened , cylindrical sections that spun independently , linked only by their common core . Node Baikonur , with its high bays ant core docking ports was at the end opposite the propulsion tower . The flight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Julian and Duwayne drove to the main lift , rode it to the core , then locked the car 's wheels into the mag strip , moving x-ward behind a couple of maintenance vehicles taking the injured to Node Korou . An I.A. cop had made the first step toward harrassing them , some complaint about the mag strips being for emergency use only , but shut up when he saw the driver was Julian . It struck Julian for the first time that if he actually went back to Management he would have to give up the cart . <p> " I wish I knew where we were going , " Duwayne complained . <p> " Still no nets ? " <p> " Nothing . How can you navigate ? " <p> " I 'm using instinct . " Not that it was working for him . He could n't remember the last time he 'd been in Node Korou  --  probably back before the divorce . He had always visualized it as low sky , unfinished . Either his memory was faulty or there had been changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the spinquake , Korou was posh . Some clever Facilities designer had taken three levels and turned them into one by ripping out the sky in a couple of places . They probably had weather here . The street was some kind of redbrick or cobblestone , not the comp you found everywhere else . Real stores with genuine windows - goods scattered all over . The people on the street surveying the damage had the well-maintained look of Management , but moved like puppets . They were jerky , stiff , dazed by being alone in their own heads for the first time in years . The fact that the lights kept flickering as power levels changed , and that suddenly frigid breezes blasted down the streets , only made it worse . <p> Julian and Duwayne turned a corner and found themselves in front of a three-story palace . " What 's this ? " Duwayne asked . <p> " Flight operations center , " Julian told him . <p> Like any good palace , the ops center had guards . They were clearly jumpy at being cut off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject to intimidation . When Julian realized it would be impossible to get a message sent inside to Roy , he and Duwayne simply told the guard they would find Roy themselves , and walked right in . <p> The interior of flight operations had once been quite grand , especially on Mission 's limited scale . There had been a genuine glass chandelier hanging over the lobby . Julian remembered vaguely that it had come from the original Mir control center in Russia . Thanks to the spinquake , alas , it was a pile of sparkly shapes on the lobby floor . <p> Down one of the corridors they found Roy being tended by a young , confused female staffer . Roy had a cut over one eye which had been bandaged , but was still bleeding . " You 're beginning to look your age , " Julian told him . <p> " If it 's any consolation , I feel considerably older . " <p> " Have you spoken to Hannah ? Is she all right ? " <p> He nodded . " She 's still working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duwayne for the first time . " I ca n't believe you showed up here . " <p> " We came to see if we could help , " Julian said , surprising himself . <p> " How nice of you . . . considering that you caused this . " Before Julian could protest , Roy added , " Diagnostics found that it was an Agon Systems virus that destroyed all Mission nets . They 're history . And so is Mission . " <p> Julian would rather have been plunged back into his lightless , weightless , airless room than hear that . " That 's not possible . The virus was supposed to self-destruct . " <p> " The system crashed before it did its job . I 've been watching them try to bring things back up . . . there 's nothing there , Julian . No environmental controls , no financial records , no nothing . " <p> " You 've got to have backups . What about Management downstairs ? " <p> " Well , almost everything exists in another form somewhere . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's no way to run Mission right now . " <p> Julian glanced at Duwayne to see if he 'd heard , or , if he 'd understood . Not a clue . The guards worried him , however . So did Roy 's continued bleeding . <p> " There 's nothing anyone can do without the nets . " Julian nodded to Duwayne , who helped Roy to his feet . They headed for the cart . " We need to get you out of here . " <p> Seeing again the physical results of the event depressed Julian . Until Roy suggested it , he had not linked the spinquake to the virus he had launched in anger . If all the wreckage and injuries were truly his fault , he would deserve whatever punishment he received . But he was n't prepared to accept that . " One virus should n't be able to bring down a whole network , " he told Roy twenty minutes later , once they had reached Node Canaveral maintenance . The windows had been blown out , but there was power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scalp , then moved on to the next patient , leaving Roy alone with Julian . <p> " It did n't , " Roy said . " We had giant system problems of our own . Your virus was like striking a match in a room full of gasoline . " <p> " You mean the SteadiState hardware worked ? " <p> " Yeah . We had a containment problem , but it was n't the hardware 's fault . It 's a good engine and we could actually launch Mission with it , though nobody in Munich will ever believe it . " <p> " That 's a shame . " <p> Roy looked at him over his enzyme drink . " What do you care ? " Before Julian could object , Roy went on . " You 've always hated the whole idea of going to Alpha Cen . You chose to work on the docks and get in with the Agon crowd . Well , you made the right choice , Julian . The way things are going now , you have more power to keep Mission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over . His face looked like the dawn . " Undernet 's back on line , " he said to Julian . " Our people are checking in . Most of them seem to be fine . " A pause . " The line is three to two that Management abandons Mission and sends us all downstairs . " <p> Julian looked from Duwayne to Roy , then back again , and knew that at least he was safe from Management harrassment . They were going to be too busy cleaning up their mess . <p> But did he want Mission to die ? It was n't likely Management would dismantle the place even if it did abandon the ExtraSolar goal , Mission had essentially been used as a space station for decades , anyway . Just figuring out which partner in Management was entitled to which chunk of this pretty Node Korou cobblestone would take the rest of the century . No , Mission would continue to be home . <p> But what kind of home ? The one lesson Julian had learned in all his business dealings was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for some it was sex . For some it was volume . But there was always a goal . " Duwayne , " he said . " Can you tell Ty to get up here ? And tell him to bring every body he can find . People who are n't integrated , some of the techs from the bay . " <p> " If you 're sure that 's what you want . . . " Duwayne looked doubtful . <p> He was n't in any mood for Duwayne 's second thoughts , so he just looked at him . Duwayne tripped over a fallen chair as he hustled back to the cart . <p> Roy said , " What are you trying to do ? " <p> " Fill a vaccuum , I think . " <p> Roy stood up , his face flushed . When Julian was eight he had accidentally erased Roy 's Magic City , one he had spent four months building . Eleven-year-old Roy had hit Julian in the mouth ; now he looked as though he was about to do the same thing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not about to get violent . He knew it would show up on his scans and bring a maintenance penalty . " You 'll never get away with it . " <p> " Get yourself on the undernet and make a bet . " <p> It was a week before Julian could again take up his place at the Seagull , and even as he sat with Duwayne and Ty , he realized it was not the same . The Seagull had been hard hit by the one-two punch of the I.A. visit and the spinquake ; its windows were gone and panelling was missing . <p> Business was still not back to normal . Well , it would never be what it was before the burnthrough . Management was still trying to bring up the new Mission net , but already the undernet had gotten several hundred new subscribers . Some of them wanted what the undernet had to offer - sex , gambling , pharmaceuticals  --  but just as many could n't be tempted . They wanted secure volume . They wanted food . They wanted to go to Alpha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At one point , Duwayne had grown impatient , getting up and walking away . Even loyal Ty spoke up . " Mr. Tallet , why do n't you get yourself integrated ? It 'd make everything so much easier . " <p> Julian glared and Ty changed the subject . A few moments later Duwayne came back . " Visitor , " was all he said . The visitor was Roy , looking much better than the last time they had met . <p> " Sit down . " <p> " I ca n't stay long . I 'm just delivering a message . " Roy glanced at Duwayne , who took the hint and got out of the booth as Roy slid in . " Riordan wants to face . " <p> " The phones are working . " <p> " He wanted me to prep you . He 's going to offer you a job . " <p> " I 've got a job . " <p> " A job in Management , Level C. " <p> A job in Level C. The idea was so ridiculous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I thought it was against the rules for the two of us to be there . " <p> Roy smiled faintly . " You know , I had scheduled myself in maintenance deliberately to see you again . " <p> " Why ? " <p> " I was actually going to warn you about the moves against all of Agon Systems ' . . . sidelines . " <p> " Well , why did n't you ? " <p> " You were being an asshole . And so was I. " Roy sighed . " We just finished a new study and that showed seventy percent of Mission pop logged onto the undernet at any given time . Half of them were management . Usage was higher than it was for Mission . It shocked everyone on C , believe me . You 've got to remember , Management started out as a bunch of engineers . For fifty years they 've been trying to build a whole goddamn world  --  not just the hardware , but right down to deciding what was right to eat and drink and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to work . It was about as useful as voting that two and two equal five . <p> " I wanted to warn you . I thought they were making a mistake , trying to fight you . I mean , if you were n't running those activities . . . someone else would . I said for years we should use you . But when I saw you  --  " He opened his hands . <p> " We acted like kids . " Julian leaned back and examined his pencil . Management . Responsibility . " What are you and Hannah going to do ? " <p> " We 're moving downstairs , to Munich  --  " He would n't let Julian interrupt . " No , I 'll be fine . I 've been scanned and integrated all along . Hannah 's been dying to go home . " He smiled . " I 'd invite you to visit , but I expect you 'll be unreachable . " <p> " You think we can actually go trans-Alpha ? " <p> " The SteadiState worlds . If everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on its way within the year . " <p> On its way to Alpha Cen . " Well , then , I 'd better see Riordan . " Roy remained seated , silent . " What 's wrong ? " <p> Roy looked up . " I feel as if I got my brother back , and now I 'm losing him . " Julian realized he had been feeling the same thing . <p> By habit , Duwayne followed Julian and Roy outside . As Julian watched his brother go , he realized he was going to have to start a family . Who with ? Sophie ? Hope ? Somebody . <p> " Duwayne , " he said . " Get me into Node Canaveral maintenance . Set up my integration . " Duwayne grinned and went to work . <p> Julian remained alone , noting the layer of dust on the wall , fighting back a sneeze . An idea occurred to him , and he reached out and scratched a new bit of graffiti in the dust : Alpha Cen - Life . <p> He did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little luck he would have grandchildren , and they would . <p> <p> <p> By Michael Cassutt <p>
