<p> As theatrical events are measured , they do n't come much bigger than " Martin Guerre , " which , after six years in the making and a production cost of about $6 million , opened last week at the Prince Edward Theater . This is Cameron Mackintosh 's big , solemn , operatic musical based on the same true story that served as the basis of the 1983 French film " The Return of Martin Guerre . " The hopes were that " Martin Guerre " would bring some much needed excitement to a depressed West End , where even well-received shows have been closing too soon . No business . <p> The opening-night audience reportedly greeted " Martin Guerre " with a standing ovation , but the notices were decidedly mixed . You could count the ticket-selling reviews on the toes of one flat foot . Most were respectful though disappointed , some were mean and one of the few raves called it " deeply moral . " Even if that were true ( which it 's not ) , this is n't the kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Martin Guerre " has a healthy advance sale , but whether it will ever travel to Broadway probably depends on the extent to which West End audiences dismiss the yawns of the critics . <p> The night after " Martin Guerre , " Paul Scofield , Vanessa Redgrave and Eileen Atkins opened at the Royal National Theater in a most actorly , if not yet entirely cohesive , production of Ibsen 's " John Gabriel Borkman . " Eight nights earlier , Andrew Lloyd Webber turned up at the Duke of York 's Theater in the West End to disarm the critics with " By Jeeves , " a pocket-size reworking by him and Alan Ayckbourn of their 1975 flop musical " Jeeves , " based on the P. G. Wodehouse characters . It 's most endearing aspect : a sweet , witty Lloyd Webber score with lyrics by Mr. Ayckbourn , done in the manner of musicals of the 1920 's and 30 's . <p> Meanwhile , what may be the most entertaining show in town is to end its limited run at the Off West End Donmar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brilliant revival of Alan Bennett 's very funny ( and bleak ) 1973 farce , " Habeas Corpus , " with a dream cast headed by Jim Broadbent and Brenda Blethyn . <p> The preopening expectations for " Martin Guerre " were understandable . After all , it was written by the same men responsible for " Les Miserables " and " Miss Saigon " : Alain Boublil ( book and original French text ) and Claude-Michel Schonberg ( book and music ) . In addition , the director was Declan Donnellan and the designer Nick Ormerod , possibly the most adventurous young theatrical team in London today . New Yorkers will remember them for their Cheek by Jowl company 's all-male " As You Like It " and , most recently , the company 's spare , razor-sharp " Duchess of Malfi , " both presented at the Brooklyn Academy of Music . <p> Further , and possibly most important , " Martin Guerre " was produced by Mr. Mackintosh , the show-biz Midas who , with " Les Miz " and " Miss Saigon , " as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phantom of the Opera " and others , has become the most successful theatrical producer in the world . <p> In this connection , last week 's London edition of Time Out , the weekly entertainment magazine , reported in its review of " By Jeeves " that Mr. Lloyd Webber recently suggested " that the days of the operatic musical ( for which he has been largely responsible ) may well be numbered . " Time Out 's critic interpreted this as Mr. Lloyd Webber 's dig at Mr. Mackintosh , his erstwhile producer , and the soon-to-open " Martin Guerre . " Whether or not it 's a dig , it may well be true if the future of the operatic musical depends on the success of " Martin Guerre . " <p> The collaborators have rethought the story just enough to remove all suspense and complex characterization . The film is a 16th-century mystery story about a peasant named Martin Guerre , who may or may not be the man who left his village years before to fight in the wars . One thing is sure : he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly loving , sexually passionate and hard working . His wife , Bertrande , and the other villagers accept him until fights erupt within the family over the division of money and property . When some passing vagabonds identify Martin as Arnaud du Thil , a professional soldier , Martin 's greedy uncle asks the church to investigate . <p> The film unfolds in a series of flashbacks and , until the end , the audience is never sure whether or not Martin is who he says he is . Mr. Mackintosh and his collaborators not only make everything easier but also a bit pointless . They identify the fellow as an imposter at the beginning , but he 's a gallant , reluctant imposter , not the schemer of the film . Having held the real Martin in his arms as he died in battle , Arnaud comes to the village to tell his comrade 's widow . He adopts Martin 's identity only at Bertrande 's urging ( it 's love at first sight for both ) when it 's clear the villagers believe him to be their long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the issue in " Martin Guerre " is religious bigotry . For reasons too absurd to mention , Bertrande first and then Arnaud become 16th-century born-again Protestants , renouncing their Catholicism so casually they might be signing up for the bowling team . Their idyllic love is ultimately consumed by religious fanaticism that sometimes seems to suggest events in Bosnia , sometimes the activities of the Ku Klux Klan . No crosses are burned onstage . Yet when an angry crowd sets fire to a scarecrow , the beloved companion of the village idiot , it 's the next worst thing . The mind reels and turns off . <p> The show is sabotaged by irrelevant plot details , by characters who are either inconsistent or vacant and by an often bombastic score that on one hearing reminded me of background music for a Cornel Wilde movie . The score includes tantalizing reminders of Mr. Schonberg 's far more rousing work for " Les Miz , " but instead of expressing and evoking emotions , it simply reports them . Not helping are Edward Hardy 's English lyrics , which sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Among the occasional pleasures : Bob Avian 's robust neofolk choreography , which often communicates the exuberance of clog dancing but without a clog in sight ; Mr. Ormerod 's handsome , skeletal sets , and especially Mr. Donnellan 's efficient handling of the large cast so that at important junctions , the principal performers are not run over by the stage traffic . One battle scene with sword fights would not be out of place in " Cyrano de Bergerac . " The performances are adequate without being distinctive . It 's Ibsen and Perverse <p> The performances in " John Gabriel Borkman " are stunning , even though the actors still seemed to be working things out on the opening night at the National 's Lyttelton Theater . The play must be Ibsen 's bitterest , most perverse comedy . It 's a triangle of sorts involving Borkman ( Mr. Scofield ) , a visionary banker and convicted embezzler ; his resentful , shamed wife , Gunhild ( Ms. Atkins ) , and Ella ( Ms. Redgrave ) , Gunhild 's twin sister , whom he once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To save the world , he has wrecked the lives of everyone around him . <p> As staged by Richard Eyre , who is soon to retire as the director of the National , the production is rough , sometimes to the point of seeming unready . Mr. Scofield 's Borkman , a prowling Prometheus of a man , rolls his r 's and makes his final syllables roar , though he does n't always appear to be acting either with or against his co-stars . <p> Possibly this is intentional : at the end of his life , Borkman inhabits his own universe . Watching Ms. Atkins and Ms. Redgrave , who were so fine in the New York production of " Vita and Virginia , " you have the pleasure of seeing two great actresses consciously exercising their talents while never betraying the play . They even come to look alike . The characters savage each other as the women playing them exult . The bifocal effect , unique to live theater , is liberating . Stripped to Its Inhibitions <p> Equally liberating but in an entirely different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corpus . " The play is being staged as Mr. Bennett intended : stripped down to essentials . There are three chairs on the stage and the back wall has been painted to represent a pale-blue Magritte sky . Nothing is allowed to get in the way of the breathtaking action of mistaken identities and interrupted assignations . <p> What sets " Habeas Corpus " apart from any other farce you 're likely to see soon is Mr. Bennett 's nasty , little-boy fascination with the human body and its functions , which also repel him . This is farce in the English mode of towering inhibitions , which is very different from the easy sophistication of the French kind . Behind all the uproarious sexual confrontations , there 's always guilt and the specter of physical decay and death . Funny ? Extremely , but also profoundly melancholy . Sending Up Musicals <p> Come October , Mr. Ayckbourn , who wrote the book and directed the current production of " By Jeeves , " will be traveling to Connecticut to direct the show at the Goodspeed Opera House , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smaller theater in Chester . A wise decision . " By Jeeves " needs a lot of work to reach American audiences , even those who already adore Bertie Wooster , Jeeves and the rest of the Wodehouse gang . <p> As it now stands , " By Jeeves " is too twee by far , being presented as an amateur theatrical within a show that begins as a county benefit , " An Evening With Bertram Wooster , " featuring Bertie and his banjo . When the banjo disappears ( Jeeves has hidden it ) , Bertie and his pals fill the time by acting out some of their more byzantine adventures . The amateur theatrical gags are lame . The fourth wall is broken so often that it 's impossible to separate the production 's various realities . <p> Yet even within the show as it stands , you can see the possibility of a first-rate , unpatronizing Wodehouse stage piece . There 's also that bright , tinkly Lloyd Webber score . It not only evokes the Bertie Wooster era but also sends up the enormous pretensions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the restless Bertie would certainly find a veritable snooze.
