Dottie Pepper inherited the talent , toughness , and self-reliance from her family . The single-minded devotion to success is all her own-and something she 's finally learning to live with // GRANDFATHER was an original . He rode a Harley , the biggest The roadster they made . If a gopher invaded his garden , he 'd sit up all night with a shotgun . ( He 'd get the varmint , too . ) He had restored a vintage Lincoln LeBaron , one of only 25 in the world , carefully bringing a rusty old wreck back to life so that it was as perfect-or more so-as the day it left the factory . It could be no other way . He had a sense of the dramatic and romantic deep in his mischievous soul . He stood tall and his eyes twinkled . He was full of life . The child cried the day she drove her mother 's father to the hospital . He knew the end was near . She cried when he died . She cries when she thinks of him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could hit and throw and run with such power and grace that major league scouts whispered among themselves in that certain knowing way . But he was also stoic and loyal . The news came that his father was dead and his mother reached out . The trouble was , he was destined to move off the farm and on to the big leagues , not back home to a farm . Photograph // But he had always solved problems face on , no noise , no whining . Life was calling . He answered . The mother was tough . A ballplayer 's wife can be nothing else . When he 's at spring training or in a slump or on a 10-day road trip , she 's in the trailer or the apartment , paying the bills and listening to the babies cry . You bet she was tough . From Saratoga Springs to Birmingham to Toledo to Detroit , and all points in between , if she wanted something done and done right , she did it herself . That 's why her family called her " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freely gave her game to the grandchild , along with all the tools she 'd need . She knew the game was a good fit for her son 's child . It is largely a solitary pursuit and this was a solitary girl . The child was a patchwork quilt ; pieced together from scraps of those who came before . She was tough and loyal and solitary and single-minded and a natural . She loved her game and loved those who loved her . And , she had a twinkle in her eyes for those who cared to look hard enough . THE BEST American player in women 's golf is blonde and talented and sometimes unrestrained , which all in all , should n't be a bad combination . She can run the table at any given moment but can be boisterous about it in the doing . Her talent runs deep , her ambition runs deeper , but , worst of all , her reputation runs deepest . Dottie Pepper has won 14 LPGA tournaments in less than nine full years on Tour . Laura Davies has won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a handful of active players have more career wins and most of them are in the Hall of Fame . And , of that group , only Nancy Lopez , JoAnne Carner , Patty Sheehan , and Beth Daniel have matched or bettered that pace . To be fair , Carner belongs to another time and Lopez is a phenomenon the likes of which women 's golf might not see again , Karrie Webb or no Karrie Webb . Pat Bradley had nine victories in her first nine years . Betsy King had won only five times by the end of her ninth year . Of the current sweethearts-through the end of September-Liselotte Neumann has eight wins near the end of her ninth season ; Meg Mallon has eight in 10 years ; Michelle McGann won three times this year to total five in eight years ; Annika Sorenstam has five in three years ; Kelly Robbins got her four wins in five years ; Webb has three in this her rookie season . But that 's not what immediately comes to mind about Dottie Pepper . It 's not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's yelling at golf balls to do her bidding . It 's cheering at an opponent 's mistake . It 's a divorce . What 's so wrong with getting the job done ? Huh ? What 's so wrong ? Nothing . Absolutely nothing , if along the way some humanity bubbles to the surface . SARATOGA SPRINGS is that place most parents dream about raising their kids and the place most kids dream about leaving . The same teachers who taught Don and Lynn Pepper taught their older daughter , Dorothy . Everyone in the upstate New York town of 25,000 knew the Peppers and the Peppers knew everyone in town . At least it seemed that way . " We got away with nothing , " Dottie says . Not that there was anything much to get away with . Oh , occasionally , Lynn Pepper would get the flyswatter after Dottie . But mostly , she was a good kid . Well , except for that one tirne in eighth grade she had to go to the principal 's office . You see , this big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kept on and kept on . Until Dottie hauled off and decked him . Was n't she afraid ? " Mom said I should have been , " she says . Her maternal grandfather , Thurlow Woodcock , ran a ski shop in town , so it was only natural that Dottie and her younger sister , Jackie , learned to climb into a set of bindings . They flew down the slopes as toddlers and crashed and got up again and crashed some more . By the time Dottie was 15 , she was an instructor , teaching beginners the rudiments of the sport . But she was as teenaged as teenagers can get and one day , while playing " follow the leader " down the slopes , she wiped out . Photograph // Instinctively , she reached out to break her fall with her hands , lest she break her glasses . Instead , she broke five bones in her left wrist . The doctor fitted her with a soft cast until he found out she was hitting golf balls . Off came the soft cast and out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impatient people need reminders . By this time , Dottie had become so smitten with golf that she took the doctor seriously . Her paternal grandmother , also named Dottie Pepper , had introduced her granddaughter to the game eight years earlier , at age 7 . Young Dottie played , mostly out of self-defense . " We were n't allowed to hang out at the mall , " she says . " We could n't just go to the movies with our buddies and hang out and end up in the wrong crowd . My parents told us we had to find something to do . So I ended up playing golf with my grandmother . " The honor roll at Saratoga Springs High School almost always listed Dottie Pepper as one of its members and when she was n't playing or practicing , she was working in her grandfather 's ski shop or playing piano at weddings . She had picked up the basics of the keyboard by ear and refined her talents with the help of an instructor . " My piano teacher desperately wanted me to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could just see myself in smoky bars or teary weddings . That was n't for me . " But she did manage to subsidize her golf by picking up a few bucks for caddie fees or gas in the car for tournaments by playing for summertime weddings . It was a life carved out of Middle America . Skiing in the winter , golf in the summer . Grandparents and uncles living within a good par five down the road . Pedaling a bike to the golf course each morning , while Dad dropped off the clubs . Golf with Grandmother in the morning , nine holes with Dad in the evening . Leave it to Dottie to stir things up a little . The Blue Streaks of Saratoga Springs High had a new member on its golf team when an eighth grader named Dottie Pepper showed up and asked to playon the boys ' varsity team . " No one in the state had ever challenged the situation , " she remembers . " The golf coach Pete Kurto made every effort to get me on the team . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take all these stupid tests in the gym , stress tests and the whole nine yards , that guys never would have had to do . I really wanted to play , so I did whatever it took . " Dottie stayed and played five years on the varsity team and was named Most Valuable Player three times . At 15 , she won the New York State Women 's Amateur . She won the state junior twice , the last time as a high school senior . That summer , she also was the low amateur in the U.S. Women 's Open and was runner-up to Heather Farr in the Maxfli PGA Junior Championship . But colleges did n't come knocking . Dottie knew she wanted to go to school in the South but wanted to stay away from Florida . She asked her high school guidance counselor to plug in some variables of location , size , and golf facilities and one of the results came up as Clemson . So , Dottie wrote a letter without knowing Clemson did n't have a women 's golf team . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women 's golf coach at Furman , located about 25 miles from Clemson in Greenville , South Carolina . Furman had everything , including traditionDaniel and King are distinguished alumni-an on-campus course , and respected academics . Pepper was a three-time All-American at Furman under coach Mic Potter and was the school 's athlete of the year in 1987 . The previous summer she had married Doug Mochrie , a club pro from Saratoga Springs . She was not yet 21 . He was 28 . THE TALENT was born of genetics . So , perhaps , was her grit . Her grandmother was a low 80s shooter , breaking that barrier periodically . Her father was once a Sports Illustrated cover boy , as a young major league phenom-to-be . Don Pepper was a gifted athlete and a prize of the Detroit Tigers farm chain . But Norm Cash was ensconced at first base in those days and there was no place on the roster for Pepper . He was traded to the expansion Montreal Expos after the Expos traded Donn Clendenon to Houston . But Clendenon refused to report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AAA Vancouver until the mess was sorted out . In the meantime , his father died and he was needed to run the family turkey farm . He did what he had to do and left big-league baseball in his rear view mirror . Like many ballplayers , Pepper gravitated toward golf and his athletic skills brought his scores into the 70s in a hurry He passed along the athletic grace genetically and his golf knowledge by rote . And , perhaps without knowing it , Don Pepper passed along something else just as valuable-a dream . " My parents say I came home as an 8 year old and announced I was going to be a professional golfer , " Dottie remembers . By that time , Dottie 's game had been turned over to George Pulver , who became more than just a teacher . He was part swing mechanic and part philosopher . He taught her to play a game and to live life . He died five years later at age 88 . Just about the time she got married . Dottie met Doug Mochrie at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was a young assistant pro . It was love at first sight . They were married about 31/2 years when Doug began to travel with his wife in 1990 , Dottie 's third year on Tour . She had her first LPGA victory the previous year , the Oldsmobile LPGA Classic . Doug carried her bag , became her advisor , manager , and teacher . They became a successful ' ' 90s kind of couple . She won for the second time in 1990 and finished third on the money list in 1991 without a victory . Then , the dam burst . Four wins in 1992 , including a major-the Nabisco Dinah Shore-Player of the Year , Vare Trophy winner for lowest scoring average , $693,335 to lead the money list , and a victory in the JCPenney Classic with Dan Forsman . But as a byproduct of the success came the breakdowns . Double ear infection and low blood count in 1992 . Rotator cuff and back sprain in 1995 , corona virus in 1996 . " I go in every year for my annual checkup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . " I push myself way too hard . That 's typical . " But she had no idea that another breakdown was just around the corner . Caught up in the midst of her rise to the pinnacle , she missed some important signposts along the way . Just did n't see them . " Everything happened so quickly for me . I did n't have a chance to sit down and let everything sink in about 1992 until after the ' ' 93 season . Then I sat down and had a good , hard cry . " THE REPUTATION was born of independence . Dottie did n't have any close friends in high school . Between golf and skiing and working in the ski shop and playing piano , there was n't time for much else . She learned to be alone , to practice alone , to play alone , to be self-sufficient . As a 16-year-old , she tried to qualify for the Corning Classic . She took the bus . Alone . " I was scared to death . " She played miserably and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ride back , " she says . " My parents were disappointed that I would think I had to qualify to be successful . They wondered where they went wrong . But that 's the type of internal pressure Type As put on themselves . " But she hopped right back on the bus the next weekend and worked the tournament as a volunteer standard bearer . " I was hooked , " she says . " I studied that yardage book for a whole year . " She qualified the next year . As an LPGA Tour rookie , she took $30,000 that her grandmother had set aside for her college education-and did n't need because of a Furman scholarship-and set out for her career . Alone . " I had talked to some people and I figured I had enough money to make it half the year , " she says . " I did n't want to owe anybody . " Armed with her independence , her resolve , and her small bankroll , she used that armament to construct a shield . Do n't come near me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am self-sufficient , and I do n't need you . " I had heard some absolute horror stories about how mean these girls were on Tour and how cliquey and how rotten they could be , " Dottie says . " So , I went in with a really bad attitude . " Photograph // And , it showed . Her temper became a legend in a short time . She rubbed people the wrong way . A lot of people . And , things soon began appearing in print that rubbed her the wrong way . " I canceled all my subscriptions , " she says . " A lot of it was misperceived . A lot of it was the guard I put up when I first came on Tour . I was still kind of feeling things out and did n't want to let my guard down . " Still , the perception persisted and much of it was her own doing , or undoing . The crowning blow came during the 1994 Solheim Cup when Davies , her opponent , missed a crucial putt . Pepper pumped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Yes ! " Many thought the invisible line had been crossed between competitiveness and recklessness , between toughness and rudeness . She was pilloried in the press . But what was not immediately seen was that her relationship with other players was changing . She formed a few close friendships-Juli Inkster , Kathy Postlewait , Cathy Gerring . " If people knew the self-doubt I have , they probably would n't hold me in the esteem they do . " If you worry about your perception of the way people see you ... " she wonders . " At the same time , in the last year-and-a-half , I 've become more comfortable with myself and maybe I 've softened a little . " THE FALL-and subsequent rise-was born of one thing and a thousand . By the end of 1993 , Doug Mochrie decided he did n't want the LPGA Tour life any longer . Dottie was in demand . Dottie was getting all that attention . Dottie was a star . " He was uncomfortable with a situation that he , more or less , created . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly deteriorated . The ' ' 90s couple began to unravel . Romance became strictly business . " The stress was incredible , " she says . " I create enough stress myself without having it from external sources . " But she played on , through the mental anguish , through the physical pain , because playing made it better . If you try hard enough , things must get better . Right ? In golf as in life , trying harder sometimes makes things worse . On the outside , Dottie looked all right . She won a tournament in 1993 and ' ' 94 , finishing fourth on the money list each year , making the Solheim Cup team in ' ' 94 for the third straight time . Inside , she was coming apart . Doug asked for a divorce early in 1995 , the day before a major championship-the Nabisco Dinah Shore-was to begin . She shot 78 in the first round and fought back to tie for 11 th . The divorce became final three weeks later , just before the LPGA 's biggest money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dottie played her way through 1995 , winning twice , good enough for fourth on the money list for the third straight year . She won a record $290,000 in the LPGA Skins Game . In September , she hit the wall . At the Fieldcrest Cannon Classic at the Peninsula Club near Charlotte , she made a 10 on her final hole of the first round . " I could n't get it over the water from 170 yards , downhill , with a 5-iron , " she says . " I was done . " I got lost with my direction . If I do n't have my focus , there 's no initiative for me to practice . I made excuses . The weather was too cold . My parents were living with me , so I did n't have any free time . But I just did n't want to practice . I did n't have anything in my golf swing that I could bank on . " I went back to the fundamentals that have worked for me since I was 7 years old . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I worked my butt off getting ready for the Skins Game and felt like I hung on by my fingernails . It was too mechanical , too analytical . I 'm a feel player . " She stumbled through the first part of 1996 with a couple of top lOs , but the end came at the U.S. Women 's Open at the Pine Needles Resort in Southern Pines , North Carolina . For the first time in her career , she missed the cut in a major championship . She was angry . She was frustrated . She wanted to leave . Right now . She did n't have a way home . " My mother was supposed to come for the weekend , " Dottie says . " When I missed the cut , I called her and said , Please come get me . ' Then , I just bawled . " She got a serious pep talk from Lynn Pepper , hauled out her old set of Titleist irons , and scheduled a lesson with old friend Ted Ossoff . Ossoff did some polishing , looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bob Rotella convinced her it was all right to be who she is . A light appeared . " Anybody who has been a good player wants to make it better , " she says . " But once you pass a point on the inverted curve trying to get better , it starts working in the opposite manner . That 's a hard thing when you think you land on that magic solution that 's going to make you a great player . " Once Dottie got all the baggage out of the way , the great player reappeared . She took two weeks off after missing the cut at the Open , returned to the LPGA Tour , and burned the place down . She won her next two tournaments , finished tied for eighth the next week , tied for 12th the next , and won again-three wins and a top 10 in five weeks . But what always happens to this Type A-or Type AAA , as former LPGA Commissioner Charlie Mechem calls her-happened again . She got sick . This time it was a corona virus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in bed for three weeks . Just as she was on a roll again . But patience persists . " I do n't want streaks , " she says . " I want a Hall of Fame speech one day . Careers are n't built on streaks . " Dottie won again right before her fourth straight appearance on the Solheim Cup team , a third American victory . Most observers would say she 's back . She , of course , has other ideas . " I 'm not there , " she says . " I probably wo n't ever say that . What I 've done in the last two months is good , but it 's not good enough . It 's because it 's not good enough for me , not because it 's not good enough for someone else . " It 's pretty damn good , nonetheless . She has a house on a mountain at the Cliffs at Glassy Mountain , near Greenville , South Carolina . Lynn runs the retail operation of the pro shops of both courses at the Cliffs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dottie bought a shiny , black baby grand piano that sits in front of a picture window that overlooks the mountain . There , she sits , leafing through the sheet music of her childhood , making music that soothes her soul . The child is a woman today . The late summer sun is warm against her face . She sits on the deck of a house-and a life-built of dreams , frustration , hope , and determination . It belongs to her and no one else . She has what she needs . The connections are in place . Dottie Pepper 's world has turned right side up . <p>
