The round of 1 048 576 The Net calls everyone it selects . That 's the rule . Always at five in the afternoon , Eastern Double-Daylight Time . Always on the Friday before June 's first Monday , the bulk of the month reserved for little else . More than a million phones sing out at once , their owners picking up as one , nervously hoping to hear the Net 's cool , unruffled voice giving them the glorious news . Another Tournament is at hand ! The best of our citizens will be pitted against each other , in a myriad of contests , the single-elimination adventure culminating in honor , wealth and an incandescent and genuinely deserved fame . <p> Some contestants like being with friends when the call comes . Not me . Bette claims I 'm scared of being embarrassed by a silent phone . Maybe so . But I think it 's because my first call was a surprise , coming when I was a kid - barely eighteen  --  and expecting nothing . I 'm at least as superstitious as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was alone that first time as well as every time since . This is my seventeenth Tournament ; I like my atmosphere of anxious solitude , thank you . And I wo n't change one damned thing . <p> Five o'clock . My phone sings , and my hands shake . Opening the line , I watch my viewing wall fill with the Net 's milk-on-jade symbol , and the expected voice says , " Hello , Mr. Avery Masters . You are ranked 20,008 in the national pool , forty-seventh in your district . Congratulations , sir . Details will follow , and as always , the best of luck to you . " <p> " Thanks , " I manage , breaking into a smile . Forty-seventh is my best local ranking ever , but in truth , I 'd hoped for better . My training has been going great ; all my qualifying tests are up . But then again , who 's to bitch ? Positive thoughts , positive results . That 's what coaches tell you . With that in mind , I brighten my smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harryman  --  a district legend . She 's deep in her eighties , both hips plastic and a carbon rod fused to a regenerated spine . She 's made fifty-one appearances in the Tournament , including its very first year , and while she never finishes high , she 's always there , always full of pluck , always garnering local praise and national mention . <p> No , I think , I ca n't ignore the lady . <p> Do n't look past tomorrow , coaches tell you . Even if tomorrow is n't for three days . <p> Our morning event is a 10K race , and the Net has given Ms. Harryman a twenty-five minute head start . That 's a brutal lead , I 'm thinking . It 's probably as much for her hips as her age . Then comes our afternoon game  --  some kind of puzzle ; that 's all I 'm told  --  and in the evening , in a tiny studio not ten minutes from my apartment , we 'll go toe-to-toe in U.S. geography . <p> I bet the old gal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm thinking , than being knocked out in the opening round by some low-rank half-artificial grandmother ? <p> When the phone rings again , I mute it . It 's probably Bette calling to congratulate me , then tease me about my opponent . Except I 'm not in the mood to be teased . Just to feel confident , I start naming state capitals . And I forget Guam 's , which puts me into a panic . I 'm taking a refresher course when Bette arrives  --  a breasty , big-hipped woman strolling into my apartment without sound . I barely notice her as she turns through dozens of sports channels , finally finding what she wants on the Net and cranking up the volume until my ears hurt . <p> " According to friends , " says a well-groomed reporter , " she felt chest pains as she reached for the phone . It was five o'clock exactly . " A lean , white-haired woman hovers over his shoulder . Ms. June Harryman . " An artificial heart is being implanted  --  " <p> " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ms. Harryman 's long-term prospects deemed excellent . " <p> " Did n't you know ? " Bette 's round face smiles , thoroughly amused . " Has n't it told you ? " <p> It means the Net , which has to know . The Net handles emergency calls , controls every autodoc , and identifies consequences in an instant . Of course it knows . <p> A light blinks on my console . Punching the button , I hear : <p> " Mr. Masters , you have a bye for next Monday . " Infinitely patient and incapable of amusement , the voice gives no sign of being impressed with my remarkable luck . " Enjoy your weekend , sir . And we 'll see you on Tuesday morning . " <p> 524 288 Reach the first round , and you 're guaranteed a few dollars . It does n't pay for a cheap treadmill or two hours of forced hypnosis , but it 's a wage , and for some people it 's all they want . The illusion of being professional , that sort of thing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get out of the first week before you earn a living wage . Win your district  --  my goal of goals  --  and you 'll have a comfortable life . But then come the regionals and the authentic wealth . And if you can defeat all twenty of your opponents  --  one of us does that trick every year  --  the Net awards you a billion dollars , tax-free , then transmits to you every congratulation from every one of your forgotten cousins . <p> Bette says the Tournament is silly . She says that a happy , wealth y nation needs better obsessions . But I do n't take her teasing too seriously ; I 'm naturally confident and self-assured , I hope . And besides , she lets me tease her in turn . I like telling her she 's one of those stuffy souls who pretend outrage , knowing they lack the talents needed to win . " Poor Bette , " say , ' without mercy . " Poor , poor Bette . " <p> I make a fair living with these June competitions . Then for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always preparing , always working my body and mind into shape for next year 's shot at immortality . <p> After Tuesday 's competition , Bette calls to congratulate me . <p> " Did you watch ? " I ask . <p> " No , " she lies . " I just saw your name posted , that 's all . " <p> It was my first day of real competition , and I 'm already among the last quarter million contestants . Today 's opponent was a man-child , a giant built of muscle and sinew , and for the morning 's contest I was the one awarded handicap points . That 's how the Net keeps things interesting . It has files on our body types , muscle types , age and general physiology , and the formulas it uses have served well for half a century . Even with my handicap points , I was behind at lunchtime , the man-child lifting a mountain of iron over his bony brow . But in the afternoon , sitting in a VR booth , I piloted my biplane in combat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead into this evening . <p> Bette tells me , " I did n't know you were such an expert in algebra . " <p> " So you watched , did you ? " <p> " Me ? Never . " Her face covers my wall ; she does n't bother softening it with a vanity program . " That was pretty cocky of you , telling that kid to lift quadratic equations for a change . " <p> " You did see it , " I shout . <p> She says , " Never . " <p> She tells me , " I just hear the gossip , that 's all . " <p> I yawn , then say , " Bette , you know the rules . " <p> " You need your rest . I know . " But before she vanishes , she says , " I just wanted to tell you , I 've got a feeling about this year . " <p> " What feeling ? " I ask , trying not to seem too curious . <p> A wink , an amused grin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waves me off , saying , " You need sleep , and never mind . " <p> 262 144 I wake from a dream where I 'm throwing basketballs in neat arcs , each one dropping through a hoop tinier than a bracelet . <p> Some competitors pay big money for implanted dreams . <p> This dream is genuine , which makes it feel like an omen . <p> Wednesday 's opponent is a smallish woman , not quite young , and she shoots from Xs made by the Net , her marks closer to the hoop than mine . As is fair . Early on , either because of nerves or simple bad luck , she misses a string of free throws , then more distant shots . Then we play some one-on-one , weights on my shoes , and I blow past her just the same , getting out to a fantastic lead . She 's so demoralized that she does n't even finish the afternoon 's puzzle , throwing its plastic pieces across the gym floor , then stalking off in tears . <p> I want to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to help next year 's ranking doing that crap . " <p> I want to say , " Play hard and face the consequences . " But instead I concentrate on my puzzle , finishing it in half the allotted time . It 's a geometric wonder full of shifting rainbows , and I take it to the nearest robot , placing it on the offered hand as the sexless voice says , " Your opponent has withdrawn , Mr. Masters . Thank you , sir , and until tomorrow . . . . " <p> 131 072 We race diamond-frame bicycles in the morning , my opponent given a substantial head start , and after fifty kilometers of hills , wind and a sudden rainstorm , I finish just twenty meters behind her , in a virtual draw . <p> In the afternoon we navigate VR landers over a cratered landscape , two hours of hovering and repeated hard landings leaving us even closer in the standings . <p> My opponent is new to the district . She 's smart , tough and capable of a withering stare . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take my podium , one hand fiddling with my buzzer , I glance her way and show a weak smile , claiming " You 'll win . Easily . " <p> " Shut up , " she advises . <p> She says , " I know all the tricks , son . " <p> Old enough to be my mother , yet made of sterner stuff , and I have to admire her . I win by points in the end  --  by almost nothing  --  and receive a fair amount of local coverage as a consequence . ( " Early round dramatics ! " That kind of thing . ) But what 's memorable for me is my opponent 's whispered offer to see me later . " After you lose , darling boy . " Romantically ? I wonder . And she laughs , saying , " Hot wet sloppy fun , " and giving me a lecherous wink . <p> I 'm polite in my refusal and secretly intrigued . <p> Later , lying awake in bed , I wonder if her offer is genuine . Or was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in revenge ? <p> 65 536 Friday , and I 'm fuzzy . Stale . Half-dead . <p> Marksmanship is the morning 's hell  --  rifles , shotguns , bows and arrows , homemade spears  --  and I end up deep in a hole . My opponent is a child , barely twenty and lucky to have made it this far into the Tournament . We play a board game in the afternoon , my strategies crippled by his wild maneuvers , and finally , with a ragged attempt at being the good sport , I concede defeat to the little shit . <p> In order to live for the year on my winnings , I need to make it to the second Monday . <p> This Tournament looks like a bust . <p> But the kid comes from an enclave of fundamentalists , and he has n't any grip on things as non-Christian as Chinese history . Standing behind my podium , I field questions generated by the Net . I buzz first , then answer . Buzz , and answer . And answer . And answer . Before we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a comfortable lead . And then I stop buzzing letting the boy have his stabs , inexperience giving him penalty points and allowing me to take whatever leftovers are easiest . <p> Arriving home , flush with victory , I find Bette waiting , all smiles . " He almost caught you in the Mao years . " <p> " Did not , " I say . <p> " What 's it matter either way ? " Bette has no competitive spark , unless it 's her fierce desire not to compete . " Let me take you out for a drink . It 's the weekend now . Is n't one little drink legal ? " <p> I feel lucky and at ease with myself . It 's not the three beers that make me drunk . It 's everything . And later , out of sheer joy , I coax Bette into my bed , using her round , unexcellent body until both of us seem happy . This is n't our first time ; we 're modem friends , meaning everything is possible . But afterward , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week , part of me wondering how I can coax Bette into leaving me , giving me solitude and the chance to recoup . <p> As if reading my mind , she rises , dresses and goes . <p> Then I sleep without dreams , crossing a great black portion of my weekend in a limp leap . <p> * * *32 768 Monday again . <p> Friday 's fuzziness is gone . I 'm sharp , smooth and self-assured , pounding at white balls pitched by human-shaped , Net-piloted robots , driving them toward a distant fence , then over it . Never , not even when hitting VR balls in my own bedroom , have I been this good for so long . And the handful of spectators  --  other people 's families , mostly  --  seems caught up in the show , breaking into applause and stomping their feet . <p> The afternoon 's puzzle is a knot begging to be untied . My fingers are magical , touching and tugging accomplishing the feat in what seems like an instant . Without effort , almost . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; tectonics to be described  --  and of course I win there , too . Afterwards , I ca n't even recall my opponent 's face . A man , I know . Of my age , I 'm almost sure . But his name and every other shred of identity have fallen away , lost . <p> 16 384 She 's tall . Strong . Quick . <p> Yet to make our fight even more fair , she wears hard little boxing gloves and a suit of puffy , self-cooling rubber . We 're here to go a full six rounds - the morning 's first contest . Both of us work hard to pace ourselves . You can win an event too well , if you 're not careful , spending all of your juices too soon . That 's why we dance and stab , dance and stab . But then for no clear reason , in the middle of the final round , I decide to charge and strike , driving her back into her own corner , then hammering away with a series of grunting wet ugly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yet I manage to do damage . The woman 's head , pretty in a doll-like way , snaps back as the final bell sounds . Consciousness lost , she topples , boom , and lies motionless on the clean white tarp . The Net deploys an autodoc while the robot referee tries to usher me aside . <p> Awaiting their turns are the other competitors  --  seated ; knowledgeable ; enthralled  --  and thinking of them , I pull away from the referee and stand over my victim . <p> In a moment of pure theater , I scream at her , trying to coax her to rise and fight me again . <p> 8 192 The net congratulates me ; it 's become a kind of habit . <p> My opponent  --  a man of my general age , build and intensity  --  is being consoled by the same smooth voice . <p> He defeated me in the high jump , then at gin rummy . Then he proved that he knows more about the solar system too , edging me out in our last event . Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I drew lousy cards this afternoon , each card from a thoroughly randomized deck , then played them with all the skill I could muster . That skill was worth a bonus . And since we were almost identical in three categories , the bonus becomes everything in the end . <p> " Not fair , " cries the other man . " This is n't right ! " <p> " Fair or not , " the Net reminds him , " our rules are public knowedge , all devised by human beings . " <p> " A poor sport , " I offer , not quite whispering . <p> The Net says , " Yes , " through the robot beside me . Then the second robot tells my opponent , " You 're welcome to file a grievance , should you wish . I can supply you with names and e-dresses for any human official  --  " <p> " Shut up ! " roars the man . <p> I stare at him , understanding him . Neither of us have ever won the second Wednesday . Tensions have their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Strangers , even to ourselves . <p> My opponent notices my stare , then charges over to say , " It likes you . " <p> " Who does ? " <p> An accusing glance at the nearest robot , at its solitary glass eye . Then he seems to lose his courage , taking a huge breath before telling me , " Forget it . Just never mind . " <p> " Go home , " the Net advises . " Start preparing for next year , sir . " <p> I 've never seen such despair on a face , and that could be me . Shattered . Cheated . Slinking off in shame . <p> " It likes you , " he had said . <p> I glance at the glass eye , then , as if in reflex , I look far away . <p> 4 096 Eight competitors remain in our district trials . <p> Our local millions arc watching . We can pretend to forget them , pretend we do n't care about them , pretend every color of ignorance possible . But some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are n't family members , who prefer their sports in person  --  and with them is an air of expectations , that sense of breath coming fast , then held in the tensest moments . <p> It 's a good day for tensions . From the standard pool of one hundred and eighty-eight physical contests , the Net has selected that event most loathed : <p> Figure skating . <p> There are eight of us , none expert . We 're not even particularly good , as it goes . I know I avoid skates as much as possible , and my weights and running and other athleticisms have blunted my grace . What matters is survival . What wins is a good double lutz and no falls . Balancing myself between disaster and inspiration , I win technical points from the Net and the human judges , thank god , do n't kill me for my lack of art . <p> Then after lunch , over neat green tables , we play pool , four games running simultaneously , spectators in the grandstand above . Every time I stoop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played a few times , me for the practice and her for the hell of it . Somehow remembering her sloppiness is comforting , her self-mocking laughter inspirational . Even when I take my bad shots , slop saves me . I build a lead that 's enough to weather the evening 's contest , which is cooking . And on this day , in a battle between two strangers , I prove myself to be the superior skater/pool player/chef . <p> Bette 's right ; this is a silly business . <p> Sitting at home , I ask the Net , " If everyone in the Tournament played everyone else , and I mean play them in every contest , would the same person win the whole shebang ? " <p> " I ca n't say , " it responds . Without hesitation , without interest . <p> " This year 's winner faces how many of us ? Twenty . " I shake my head , tossing my reader to the floor . " Twenty of us , and sixty contests . Is that a ridiculous measure of excellence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There 's an instant of silence , then the Net informs me , " Reality is chaotic . I ca n't calculate all the variables in one contest , much less all that can happen in a full Tournament . " <p> I say nothing . <p> " By definition , " it adds , " every Tournament is inadequate to the task . " <p> I barely listen , thinking my own thoughts . <p> " Any more questions , Mr. Masters ? " <p> " Did you know , " I ask , " that billiard balls hitting each other lose their exact positioning in space ? " <p> " Yes , " it replies . Of course it knows . <p> I ca n't recall how many collisions are needed , but it has to do with the quantum vagueness of the universe . Leaning back in my chair , I close my eyes , imagining colored balls in motion  --  countless ; ceaseless  --  chaos reigning on a smooth green table without rims , without ends . <p> 2 048 It 's evening , early . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Alaska . Bette has come to help , which means teasing me for my tastes in socks . There 's just one pair of district competitors left , they cover my largest wall , spouting on about architecture . I should be there , enjoying the applause and flashing lights , but my opponent  --  last year 's district winner ; this year 's first seed  --  was disqualified this morning . The Net did n't like the taste of his blood . Using subtle , parts-per-ten-billion drugs , he had tried lifting his abilities just enough to win . As they say , " On the even playing field , molehills count . " But then again , how do you hide your molehill ? <p> What , I wonder , was that idiot thinking ? <p> Bette wants to know what will happen to him . <p> " A suspension , " I say . " For a few years , I guess . " I close my suitcase , then sag , feeling almost fragile . Last night I dreamt of losing , and I woke convinced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opponent ; I 'd had a good run of it this year , i was thinking . Nobody was more surprised by the disqualification than me . <p> " Why did he take the drugs ? " Bette asks . <p> " To win , " I respond , by reflex . " He was looking past me , aiming for the regionals . " <p> She stands beside me , a meaty breast nudging my arm . " Did he really hope to slip past the Net 's tests ? " <p> " Some of us do , " I grumble . " I 've told you the rumors . " All the big names  --  Yang and Fogg , Christianson and the rest  --  use special elixirs cooked up in dark foreign labs . Their advantage is a hundredth of a second , a question in fifty . No test known can catch every illegal device  --  <p> " What if he wanted to be caught ? " she asks . <p> I glance at her , then try changing subjects . " Come with me . I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want a cheering section ? " She has a hearty laugh and a way of seeing through me . " I thought you preferred your friends out of sight and mind . " <p> " Just this once , " I say . <p> " Maybe , " she responds . But later , after making love , she tells me , " No , I should stay home . " <p> " Why ? " <p> " I 've got crops to watch . " <p> Bette is peculiar . In a society of wealth and relentless leisure , she raises her own food and makes most of her own clothes . She 's something from the Dawn of Man , which I find fascinating ; and like a thousand other times , I tease her for it . <p> She shrugs in the dark , then changes the subject . " I 've watched replays of the disqualification . I saw your opponent 's face when he was told . " A pause , then , " Maybe he did n't know it , but I think he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> " He did so well last year . " A deep sigh . " What if this year was n't nearly as much fun ? " <p> I ca n't understand her point . <p> " You 've always said that all you want is to win the district . You do n't expect to ever go farther . " <p> Suddenly I 'm glad that Bette is staying home . With a dose of cold fury , I tell her , " Go watch your fucking crops . " <p> I 'm more startled by the words than is she . <p> 1 024 My opponent is the fourth seed in our district , the prohibitive favorite today . Beat her , and I 'm not just the local champion  --  our lone warrior against the nation 's best  --  but I 'm also one of the year 's Cinderellas , guaranteed all the attention that comes to statistical flukes . <p> For these next two weeks , the order of events is reversed . Mental contests in the morning . The usual afternoon game . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contest  --  something full of drama to captivate the distant throngs . <p> Today we 're running 100 meter sprints , 512 identical races held in and around Anchorage . I enter it trailing , but not by much . To win , I have to make up my opponent 's head start , then pass her , winning by a leisurely .3 of a second . " Just do a great race , " I tell myself , settling into my starting block and looking at a string of lights  --  red , red , red , green . I wait . My opponent goes with her green light and a sharp tone . I wait . My red lights run to green  --  beep  --  and I leap up , racing the length of my narrow black lane , working to relax , to breathe , then extending my chest at the finish , twisting my head sideways to watch the numbers appear on the giant scoreboard . <p> " No ! " I won by .299 seconds , which means , I realize , we have tied . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us , and we 'll have to run again . <p> " Rest , " we 're told , by the Net and by our gracious human hosts . " You 'll go again in an hour . Relax . " <p> An hour later , we run mirrors of our first races . <p> Again , we tie . <p> This is big news . Huge news . In the next hour , every sports network and mathematical hobby channel sends reporters to supply interviews and inane commentary . A hyperactive fellow dances around me , begging for my thoughts , goals and dreams ; and in lieu of honesty , I sputter cliches . " Concentration wins , " I say . " One stride at a time , " I say . Then gazing into a hundred floating , sparrow-sized cameras , I wave and say , " Hi , Mom ! " <p> Everything is the same for the second rerace  --  the lane ; the crisp air ; the dreamy remoteness of the world  --  but this time I try willing myself to greater speeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a distant form , and then she 's forgotten . I make my legs burn . My lungs burn . I punch my chest through the laser beam , and turning , my eyes fuse on the board . <p> This is Hell . <p> My time has n't changed , not by a hundredth of a second . <p> For the rest of my life , I realize , I 'll have to race this race , never able to win , never willing to lose . <p> Then I think to look for my opponent , puzzled that she is n't standing where I expect . What 's happened ? A bent , hobbling figure is in her lane , the right leg bloodied by a terrific fall . I never saw her fall . I was too focused to notice , although tonight , in my hotel room , I 'll watch the event a thousand times . Straining for speed , she tripped over her own foot , colliding with the ground and sliding , then rising , staggering toward the useless finish line . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congratulations , Mr. Masters . You are champion of District Three-Eleven/ ' <p> The woman is in agony , face streaked with tears , the healthy fresh blood streaming along her leg . Wanting to be the good sport , I walk toward her ; when my hand is offered , she slaps it away . When I say , " Next year , " she tries to kick me with her bad leg . <p> " Get back ? she shouts . " I 'm racing here , asshole ! " <p> 512 This is who I am : <p> I 'm that jerk at the party who knows everything about Byzantium , the chemistry of phosphorus , dog breeding , homosexual Presidents , and the fate of the Universe . <p> I 'm the guy taken third for a pick-up game of basketball , then sinks ten circus shots in a row , winning the game for his team as well as winning the hotdog reputation . <p> I 'm a tower of confidence , admired by some , envied by most , and generally perceived as being distant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Although that 's far from fair . ) <p> I 'm a mortal  --  prince , stable boy or whomever  --  who just might have once been touched by the gods . <p> And now , maybe for the first time , I realize how I look to others . I find myself surrounded by myself  --  the 511 other district winners  --  and there comes a powerful urge to wilt , turn to dust , and blow away . <p> I 'm not qualified to be here . <p> There 's only one other competitor with a lower rank , and I 'm watching her charge through the obstacle course , through mud and hoops and across greased rails and rope bridges . She 's a portrait of focus and sputtery white energy . I envy her . We 're performing in a giant stadium filled with screaming fans , yet I seem able to hear her strong breathing , the wet grunts , and the squish of mud underfoot . <p> On a slippery slope , she plants a foot and turns too quickly , the crack like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has collapsed . <p> " That knee 's finished , " says the competitor beside me , his tone almost amused . I recognize him . He 's Elijas Fogg , this year 's Number One seed : a tall and handsome man . No , a beautiful man . He 's not my opponent , yet he seems to know me . As the crowd moans in one voice , he turns and remarks , " Well , now you 're their favorite . " <p> " Whose favorite ? " <p> He smiles as if facing an idiot . " Who do you think ? " <p> The spectators ? Is that who he means ? <p> " Now you 're the one most like them . " He grins with effortless menace , no set of teeth more perfect than his . " Among us , you 're the closest to being average . Ordinary . " A pause . " Pathetic . " <p> I do n't know what to say . Before us , robots lift a squirming , mud-caked figure onto a stretcher . Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Do you know why they love the Tournament ? " <p> The spectacle of it ? The competition ? Or the pursuits of glory and excellence ? <p> I say none of those things . <p> His head lifts as if posing for some dead Greek 's urn . " They love watching us claw at each other . They adore watching us crash and bum . " A sideways glance at me , then a bitter smile . " Almost all of us fail , and the bastards drink it in . " <p> My bastards , I tell myself . <p> " Mr. Fogg " I tell him , " you 've always been an inspiration for me . " <p> Of course I am , his face seems to say . <p> Refocused , reenergized , and given a sterling cause , I conquer the obstacle on a dead run , beating my opponent by just enough . Then I take my victory lap , trotting past the roaring crowd , arms overhead and my bastards on their feet , the air itself seeming to nourish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me at seven-fifty , as asked . <p> When I want details about the day 's competition  --  my opponent ; the events ; the logistics  --  it supplies accurate , thorough answers , anticipating most of my follow-up questions . Through the course of the day , it keeps me aware of time and my schedule , the scores and what I need to do to lead , then what I need to do to keep my lead . When I want a snack , its nearest robot delivers hard candy and half an orange . When I pull a muscle during warm-ups , it prescribes a legal anti-inflammatory , administering it through one of its autodocs while lowering my handicap by a mandatory amount . And when I win , the Net tells me , " Congratulations , " with its changeless voice , nothing warm or unwarm about it , no trace of involvement , and nothing behind the words but an unshakable politeness . <p> Meanwhile , without fuss or failures , the Net runs our factories on the earth and in orbit . It manages our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and every entertainment that requires its talents . Mistakes are made  --  thousands every day , none major  --  but even the mistakes help perpetuate the image of seamless competence . The Net and several competing human agencies find and measure each failure , and guess which count is always , always the most accurate count . <p> Victorious and grateful , I lie awake in my softly lit room , listening to new thoughts . I ask to see the Net 's symbol  --  a branching white tree on a background of stylized green humans . In a low voice , I ask , " Do you ever hold your own Tournament ? " <p> " Toward what end , sir ? " <p> " Pit your subsystems against each other . Give awards to the most incompetent ones . " <p> " But for what purpose ? " <p> " Your winner can be named the most human . " <p> The Net says , " My subsystems do n't resemble organic life . " <p> Yet I do n't care , smiling to myself , telling it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What do you think ? We can put them together . Send them out on a date , maybe . " <p> I laugh , asking the silence , " Would n't they deserve each other ? " <p> 128 In my youth , without a trace of affection , classmates called me Avery Allosaurus . <p> Old hobbies never leave a person . Thirty years later , I find myself unearthing all kinds of intellectual fossils , smashing my opponent in the morning 's contest . It 's pure luck that the topic is paleontology ; my opponent is left punch-drunk , desperate . Sure , he wins back points while fighting inside a VR battle tank . But not enough points . I 've got such a lead that in the evening , as we climb different portions of the same rock wall , he elects to leave his safety lines behind , trying to scamper to the top unencumbered , goat-style . <p> I ca n't see his fall , but I feel it . <p> I feel the crowd below turn to ice . Without sound , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human species no match for the rocks below . Then comes a moan and collective shudder . My opponent is this Tournament 's first death ; a distinction is won . <p> Bette calls me afterwards , ready to console . Yet I do n't feel guilt or sorrow . " He 's to blame , " I say , shrugging my shoulders . " I did n't remove the ropes , did I ? " <p> Bette looks tired . Unhappy . Wise . She 's calling me from her cluttered house  --  I 've never liked that house  --  and she tells me , " I rather miss you , Avery . " <p> I make some appropriate mirroring noise . <p> She says , " You 're doing well , " with a sense of disbelief . <p> I need to be stretching , and reviewing . But instead I laugh and say , " You should hear the talk about me . " <p> " Like what ? " <p> " I 'm a jinx , people say . Going against me is dangerous . The Net @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opponents . " <p> " Oh , ' she exclaims , as if in pain . <p> " You should see them , Bette . " A pause , a grin . " Some of them are actually terrified of me . I 'm the lowest-ranked person to make it this far in years , and they 're scared . " <p> She nods . Then she says , " Stupid . " <p> I agree . " You think I 'm superstitious . You should see these people , Bette . All day long , it 's rabbit feet and rituals . " <p> " All of it 's stupid . . . ! " <p> " But the thing is , I believe them . I am jinxed . I 'm dangerous . The Net adores me and it helps me . All that just makes me more confident . " <p> " Idiotic . . . . " <p> " I could n't have fallen tonight , Bette . " I almost believe those words , adding , " And if I had fallen , somehow , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way ! " <p> 64 Everyone has their favorite Tournament winner . Mine , without a microgram of doubt , is Leonard Dab . In ' 81 , I was a boy not quite thirteen , at the age where heroes appear when you expect them . Dab was just unlikely enough to catch my attention and sympathies . A veteran of almost thirty Tournaments , he 'd never finished higher than the fourth Monday . Small and gray , he was a sinewy alley fighter , past the age of perfect recall and dependent an old joints and handicap points . Today I realize why old Dab has been my favorite . There have been greater victors , and prettier ones . When I was sixteen and hormonal , the infamous Mattie Yung killed her opponent in the nineteenth round , in a karate match ; and of course I fell in love . Then there 's William the Conqueror from ' 79  --  the largest point total of all time . Or Stef MacGraw from ' 51 and ' 53  --  the only two-time winner . But no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlikely Leonard Dab , the Cinderella of his year , and now , after so long my inspiration . My unwitting mentor . <p> Last night , after the final competitions , the Net randomly selected Tournament history for the morning 's competition . It 's not a remarkable choice , but it 's fortuitous for me . Late-night studies ca n't make you an expert before dawn . Just ask my opponent . Our M.o.C. is the best in her profession , reading the questions without favoring either of us ; yet I can tell she expects me to answer first , and correctly . What 's the biggest , fastest , longest , smallest in the Tournament ? Who did , who did n't , who should have , who perished ? Amid flashing lights and musical tones , I thrive , building a lead worthy of its own trivia question . Out of a thousand available points , I win 907 . Even when I lose the next two contests , I remain entrenched in the lead , the Net just waiting to the end before offering me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The M.o.C. congratulates me , then invites me to dinner in her hotel suite . Twenty years my senior , but lovely , she 's the product of good genetics and every available beauty aid . In the middle of the night , trying to rest , I ask how many Tournaments she 's worked in . " I started in ' 67 , " she replies , " and I have n't missed since . " <p> Knowing there 's no chance of it , I ask , " Did you meet Leonard Dab ? " <p> She takes a quick breath , then laughs . " Did I ever ! " <p> " You did ? " I sputter . <p> " For an old piece of oak , " she informs me , " he was a spry little maniac in bed . " <p> I lie still , calculating the odds . <p> And now she is n't holding me , but my hero . The hands still touch me , but their curl and a new gentleness imply someone else . Someone treasured . <p> * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's errorless count , I receive three million requests for introductions , interviews , business partnerships , other partnerships , product endorsements , and a crisp little message from Bette . <p> " Remember me ? " she asked yesterday . <p> It 's Monday  --  lunchtime  --  and I need a distraction . I call her , and the Net finds her outdoors , working in her shaggy garden . With a joking voice , I ask , " Have n't you been watching me ? " <p> A stony expression , a shrug . " Now and again . " <p> " It 's going great , " I tell her . Then I launch into a rambling , self-congratulatory speech , boasting about my current lead and my opponent 's miserable prospects . This afternoon is chess ; I 'm really very good at the game . Which means I 'll take that event and hold on through tonight 's pole vault  --  <p> " Who are you ? " Bette interrupts . <p> I hesitate , for an instant . <p> " You look like Avery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asshole . " <p> " What 's that mean ! " <p> " You 're boring , " she says . " And worse than that , you 're silly . " She pulls up a random plant . Weed or not , it does n't seem to matter . " Why are we talking ? We 've got nothing in common . " <p> With the charity of a minor god , I decide that she 's jealous . It 's a question of my success , and it 's understandable . " Nothing 's going to change between us , " I assure her . " Soon as I 'm done , in a few days , I 'll come home and treat you to anything you want  --  " <p> " I 'm doing what I want now , " she says , her voice certain . Rock-solid . <p> " Are you ? " <p> What does the woman want ? <p> " When you lose , " she asks , " what happens ? " <p> I give a quick snort , then explain , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for next year . " <p> " But why ? " <p> " Have n't you been paying attention , Bette ? " I point a finger at her sun-washed face . " This is what I do for a living . Remember ? " <p> She starts to speak , then hesitates . <p> " What ? What is it ? " <p> She opens her mouth , saying nothing . <p> " Say it ! " I plead . <p> " I guess I feel sorry for you . " <p> Now I 'm mute , a mind geared for chess finding itself in a new game . How can she pity me ? It has to be jealousy , a fear of losing me . I try to leave things unresolved , smiling before I tell her , " I 'm sorry you feel that way . " <p> Once again , she says , " Remember me ? " <p> It 's the same voice , but it 's not a plaintive cry for attention . Not at all . Like one friend bidding adieu to another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> " Hey  --  ! " I begin . <p> She vanishes with the stab of a thick little finger . <p> 16 I am beaten . <p> That 's the verdict going into Tuesday evening . Yesterday ! survived a poor game of chess , making an inspired vault to hold my lead . But that wo n't happen tonight , and everyone knows it . Suddenly the other competitors and their entourages begin to smile at me , knowing the point totals , feeling enough at ease to congratulate me on my luck and determination . " You 've made it interesting , " they concede . " Interesting is good . At least for a little while . " <p> Tonight 's event is a ski run , the snow freshly made and refrigerated  --  a long white ribbon winding down a green mountainside , made all the more treacherous by a warm Alaskan day . I have n't skied since last winter , excluding VR trainers . My opponent is a better-than-good skier , a three-time Week of 32 finisher , and she last skied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ icecap . I ca n't win , and even I know it . How could I have ever hoped to beat these people in this business ? With nothing to lose but my joints , I take the mountain like a madman , slicing over the finish line and fifteen entourages beginning to cheer , knowing how it will end . <p> My opponent follows . She does n't exactly crawl down the mountain , but she knows better than to take chances . She always knows her time . She leaves herself ample cushion . On the tight turns she looks like a talented novice , poles biting the ice , a radiant smile growing by the moment , her victory in the proverbial bank . <p> Caution keeps her on the course too long . <p> Ten or fifteen seconds too long . No more . <p> The earthquake arrives with a terrific jolt  --  not a big quake , but one focused beneath our locale  --  and my opponent falls , then regains her feet and form . But then the sun-softened ice panics , shaking and sliding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground , spreading like a fan and nearly drowning half of the entourages . <p> As it happens , nobody dies . <p> But my opponent never crosses the finish line , and the line itself has vanished . Acts of God are covered in the Net 's copious rule book , and despite a century of predictive science , earthquakes remain godly events . <p> By default , I 'm declared the winner . <p> And still , despite the intervention of the Almighty , the Net merely says , " Congratulations . " Its voice is as constant as gravity . " Until tomorrow , sir . And best wishes . " <p> I 'm standing in a meadow , watching slush melt . <p> No human wants to come near me . <p> They wo n't even look at me , I realize . They are that impressed and that afraid . <p> The same as me . <p> 8 Today 's opponent  --  a popular , highly seated individual  --  just happens to fall down a set of stairs in the morning . He claims it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pause on the top step , dipping his head a few times as if in practice , then taking an elegant , athletic dive . <p> Intentionally or not , he gives me another win . By default . <p> With hours of free time , I decide to borrow on my winnings , purchasing gifts for friends . I send to Bette an expensive crystal vase made on the moon , and a gross of rootless roses , and the deed to a hundred hectares of prime black earth . I compose two cards . The first card reads , " Of course I 'll see you again . " But I do n't send it , preferring my second attempt . " I want to see you . I want to see you now . " <p> That card and my gifts are taken on the next hyperplane . <p> By evening , Bette has given the land to a wildlife foundation , and the Net delivers her bloodless " thanks but no thanks " note . <p> I 'll hate her , I decide . <p> Soon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schedule , but without her heart . <p> Certain people in the Tournament hierarchy are furious about yesterday 's default . It diminished our audience , and this may not be the record year they 'd anticipated . My opponent has been warned that if she wo n't compete today , she 'll suffer , the threats as ominous as they were vague . She tells me everything as we wait to enter identical VR booths . Wearing plastic armor and holding short plastic swords , we 'll become generals in Alexander 's army , our afternoon to be spent hacking the heads off Persians . Holding her weapon in mock defiance , my opponent tells me , " I 'm not afraid of you . " <p> I say nothing . <p> " Luck is statistics , " she claims . " You 've been lucky , but does n't that happen to one person in a million ? " <p> Yeah , that 's what the cliche says . <p> " And luck does n't care what happened yesterday . " She means to sound profound , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shown up , he would have beaten you and beaten you badly . " <p> I touch her breastplate , waiting for her gaze . <p> Then I ask , " So why are you afraid ? " <p> Eyes widen ; her sword drops . <p> " I 'm scared of myself , " she admits . " What ? ' know ' is n't what I ' believe . ' " <p> I believe I 'll win , and that 's what happens . Her heart is n't in the game , and she loses despite a last minute surge in the evening 's sculling . In the end , I take the fourth Thursday , gaining entry into the most exclusive and hallowed realm imaginable . <p> Save one . <p> The Round of 2 I 'm awake , alert . <p> Despite a night of little sleep , I 've never felt so alive . <p> Just as I 'm ready to leave for the morning 's contest , a man arrives , his calm voice telling me , " We have her . " I hired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he and some associates flew home , running an errand for me . " All things considered , " he warns me , " she 's in good spirits . " <p> Bette is brought to me . <p> On the wall of my penthouse suite , Elijas Fogg eats his customary breakfast in public view . His entourage  --  relatives , staff , friends and lovers  --  fill every table in the restaurant ; his manner is calm to the point of icy . I 've been studying him . Without looking at Bette , I say , " I 'm glad it 's him . Do you know what he thinks about ordinary people ? " <p> " Not much , I 'd guess . " <p> I grin , turn . " Are you all right ? " <p> She does n't answer , standing in the middle of the enormous room . Smoldering . <p> I ca n't blame her , but there 's no time for apologies . " I 've got a question for you , Bette . " <p> " So ask it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you told me that you had a feeling about this year 's Tournament . You implied that it would be special  --  " <p> " Avery , " she snaps , " I tell you that every year . You just forget it when it does n't come true . That 's all . " <p> I 'm watching Fogg chewing on his ritual English muffin topped with grape jam . I keep hoping for a trace of fear , a hint of weakness . That the man seems perfectly at ease unnerves me . Suddenly my breath quickens , my mouth going just a little bit dry . <p> " There 's a bigger tournament than yours , " Bette adds . <p> The words strike my ears , but it takes my mind a long moment to string them into a coherent whole . By then she 's saying : <p> " Think of all the sperm in the world , Avery . All those frantic little boys with their wriggling little tails . How many actually find their egg ? One in a billion ? In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " We 're here , Avery . But a trillion trillion other people are never even born . Never get the chance to exist . See what I mean ? Existence dwarfs this bush-league contest of yours , which is just as it should be . " <p> I say nothing , watching Fogg wipe his mouth with a folded napkin . <p> " Being alive is an enormous honor . Nothing else compares . " Bette almost touches me , then pulls away and tries to laugh . " Do n't I sound maudlin ? It 's probably the stress of being kidnapped , do n't you think ? " <p> " I 've got to go , " I mutter . <p> She says , " So go . " <p> I make myself stand , then I tell her , " Stay here . Or I 'll fly you home , if that 's what you want . " <p> " That 's what I want . " <p> Fogg rises to his feet , and with a quiet , confessional voice , I admit , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> And Bette says , " I 'm sorry , " with genuine misery . <p> The 1 It 's the most watched Tournament day in history  --  ninety-nine percent of all Americans  --  and that despite my losing each and every round in turn . <p> During the final event , wrestling on a sweat-slicked mat , Elijas Fogg works me into a twisted position , then uses a questionable maneuver to break my right arm . <p> Mouth to my ear , he whispers , " You 're just another bastard . Again . " <p> The Net congratulates him , then me . <p> While an autodoc Sets my bone , reporters swarm around me . What are my thoughts ? What are my plans ? With my new wealth I can train with the best coaches , in the topflight facilities . Of course that 's what I 'll do , they assume ; when I tell them I 'm retiring , they 're visibly shaken . <p> " It was a fun run , " are my concluding words . <p> Fogg stands on the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about winning next year . He as much as promises to become one of the authentic greats in Tournament history . <p> Can Fogg really repeat ? <p> My audience abandons me for richer fare . <p> Turning to my autodoc , I ask , " What are the odds that in our universe , in the foreseeable future , I 'll be reassembled from the atoms ? I mean me . Just as I am now . " <p> The Net responds in an instant , that liquid smooth voice saying , " I do n't know how to accurately calculate such a number . " <p> It 's funny . All the time and sweat spent mastering so much , and it never occurred to me that life was such a golden , splendiferous reward . Not once , and it 's funny , and the Net asks if I 'm in some distress . . . I 'm laughing that hard . . . . <p> <p> By Robert Reed <p> Last month , we published a near-future horror story by Robert Reed . This month , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " The Tournament .
