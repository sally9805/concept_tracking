PUT THE B-2 ON THE SKIDS <P> GIVE THE MONEY TO THE KIDS <P> House Armed Services Committee chairman Les Aspin did not quote that bumper- sticker slogan last week , but he made the same point . Reversing his previous support for the Stealth bomber , Aspin urged a halt in future production for two main reasons : 1 ) the virtually undetectable plane 's costs are soaring ( $63 billion for 75 planes ) , and 2 ) the ebbing of the Soviet threat has left the bomber without a clear-cut mission . Says Aspin : " Much has happened in the past year , but nothing that has happened has improved the case for the B-2 . " <P> The House is likely to agree with Aspin , but the Senate 's response is unpredictable . Armed Services Committee chairman Sam Nunn admits that the Stealth is in worse trouble than ever : " Chairman Aspin 's decision will make the fight to preserve the B-2 an uphill battle . " The fight could turn on economics . Some experts predict that killing the B-2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corp. , and the loss of at least 12,000 jobs .
