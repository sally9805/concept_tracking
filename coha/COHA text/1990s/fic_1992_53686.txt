LET ME BE STRAIGHTFORWARD . I was seeing somebody , and Susan found out . With the afternoon sunlight streaming through our living room windows , she and I had a quiet but definitely unpleasant chat . <p> Peter , she said with her lips tightening . I know these things happen . But I 'm not just going to stand by . You make your choice . Either you 're in or you 're out . <p> We 've got two kids . We agreed that I would cease seeing somebody . As of immediately . The hard line , though not unreasonable . I chose in . <p> But somebody had some things to say  --  or to shout about in my ofrice . Why was n't she asked what she wanted and who the hell ordained my wife as the one to say when she and I were finished ? Look at her , was she dirt , was she compost for the garden of my marriage ? Look her in the eyes , damn it , was n't I man enough at least to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Sports Spot , where I worked . I was Public Relations and Advertising . Julie was our Senior Fitness Instructor . Compact , with long dark hair and delicate features , Julie had a physique that made our members  --  male and female  --  blink the first time they saw her in her leotard . Julie disconcerted people ; she was small and had this girlish face , but she was the fittest person I ever met . And she took no shit . <p> My situation was impossible . I had a talk with the boss . <p> Ben Fulton and I went way back to when I came off the tour and he was looking for a tennis instructor who could attract new members to Sports Spot . In 1975 I beat Nastase in the quarterfinals at Bretton Woods  --  doodly-squat on the tour , but for a few years around here that credential helped make me the pro every tennis-playing housewife wanted lessons from . They signed their kids up , too . Teaching was easy for me , easier than playing had been , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect body for the game . So in those early days I had helped make Sports Spot successful , and in the last few years Sports Spot had made Ben Fulton a wealthy man . <p> Do you want me to fire her ? he asked . <p> I told him no , she 'd have us in court and in the papers , not to mention beating the crap out of both of us . <p> She could do it . He shrugged and grinned . Then he said , Tell me about her , Peter . <p> I ca n't do that , Ben , I said . But I did go ahead and share a thought or two with him about Julie , because over the years Ben has been generous with me . He gave me my own office , he looked the other way when my clients needed individual conferences , and when I burned out on teaching tennis , he let me move up to management . <p> She 's even better than she looks like she would be , Ben , I said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodded and gazed out his window . We were quiet for a while . <p> So what Ben and I worked out was that with a fax machine and a computer , there was no reason why most of the time I could n't work at home . No reason to come into Sports Spot if my being there was going to cause a disruption . <p> What we said officially was that I was being given a leave of absence . This had the appearance of punishment . It calmed Julie and the other female fitness instructors who sympathized with her . A certain calming effect , Ben said on the phone and chuckled . Not too much action around here without you , Peter . <p> That 's how we like it , is n't it , Ben ? I said . I was n't kidding . There comes a time when you want to give up all the bullshit that goes with fooling around , but I kept that to myself . Quiet around here , too , I told him , and my work is good , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great , Peter , Ben said . At the edge of his voice I could hear what he was n't saying . He had little respect for my ideas ; he revised all my press releases before they went out . He was polite about it , but basically I was just the guy who produced his first drafts . <p> Nevertheless , there I was , set up at home on the third floor . A few years ago Susan and I had had half of the attic finished , thinking we might want to rent a room to a college student . Then Susan 's grandfather died , leaving her enough money to keep us from really needing rental income . When I told her I was going to start working at home , Susan was delighted that we 'd finally be able to put that room to use . <p> It had shelves and a skylight . Instead of a new floor , we had just put down some old carpet from our bedroom . I had to buy a desk and some chairs , but Ben insisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Maybe I was n't an advertising genius , but brilliance was n't what Sports Spot needed , just somebody to keep the public informed . I understood how to do that , maybe even better than Ben did . <p> I 've never had what coaches call " a good work ethic , " but I put in my hours ; I put forth some effort . If I did n't give the job my all , at least I gave it my most . <p> And things around home were better than they had been for a while . With Julie off my mind , I was able to focus my attention on Susan . As her anger subsided , I began remembering what an attractive person I married . She 's blond , tall , very thin and willowy . Suddenly I noticed what subtle taste in clothes she had , what a pleasure she was to look at . You might say that I revitalized my interest in Susan . <p> Susan got a promotion down at the bank ; so I started taking up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I washed the breakfast dishes , and most evenings I was the one who fixed dinner . I ran more errands than I used to , but that was all right because my hours were flexible . <p> Things are lots better , are n't they ? I asked Susan one evening when we were lingering at the table after one of my better dinners . The kids were in the basement watching TV . <p> They 're not so bad , she said , grinning off toward the dining room window in a way that I knew meant she was thinking about it . Then she got up and walked around the table , walked around behind me and ran her fingers along my shoulders . Not really so bad , she said . <p> I did n't mention it , but a big part of what I liked about those changes was having so many hours to myself during the day . I 'd never had that experience . Hour after hour , the quiet just stretched out . <p> Up there in the office , noticed how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the floor toward me . Sometimes I just sat there , doing nothing , thinking about nothing , for do n't know how long . <p> Then when I did start pecking at the keyboard again , the writing went smoothly and quickly . I seemed to have composed my phrases without really having thought about them . I did n't have to force my work out the way I used to . <p> I began to appreciate my house . That sounds funny , I know , but you know the way you get to like a particular racquet or a pair of shoes or even a court that you play well on a number of times . It was like that , except more personal . The house was like my personal friend , good company for me , helpful . <p> I 'd stand up from the desk , walk around , come downstairs and look out this window and that , go to the refrigerator and have some juice , pick up a magazine , listen to a record . <p> It felt good to spend those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe . Until now I had n't been able to rid myself of an old fear of being alone in the house . Of course as an adult , I 'm a big enough guy , and I 've kept myself in shape . But when your job has you seeing people all the time , you never really know what 's going to come at you . At Sports Spot most of the time everything had been pleasant , but there were exceptions . <p> Like Julie shouting at me in my office . At home , when I remembered that morning , I had to shake my head and wonder how I got through it . <p> I was glad to be in my own house , with the computer humming quietly and a block of sunlight just approaching my foot . That morning I was caught up on all my deadlines , the phone was n't ringing , there was nothing I really had to do until three when the kids got out of school . I was getting an early jump on our Fall Membership Campaign . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt when he climbed up onto some little shelf on the side of a mountain to spend the rest of his life in the lotus position , gazing down over the valley and contemplating the universe . <p> A noise downstairs reminded me of the one negative aspect about this working arrangement . From up on the third floor , could n't really hear the front or the back doorbell . If anybody came to see me on urgent business , I 'd miss out on it because I would n't know they were down there . <p> But sometimes there were little noises that would catch my ear , and I 'd go down to see about them . They 'd be nothing but some creaking or shifting of the house . Sometimes I found that the UPS man had left a package on the back porch . But almost always it was nothing . So I tried to keep myself from being distracted and running downstairs every time I heard something . <p> It was like that that morning . I was in this positive state of mind and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an idea was approaching , maybe a slogan for our Fall Membership . Campaign , though I knew that whatever I came up with Ben would change and then take credit for it . <p> But I could have sworn there was somebody else in the house . It was n't even noise exactly but something like the floors registering weight moving across them . We 've got wall to wall carpet in every room of the main floor and the second floor , and so you really do n't hear footsteps in this house . YOU just sense people moving through the rooms . That sensation was making me uncomfortable since there was n't supposed to be anybody down there . <p> So went downstairs to check it out , and when I reached the second floor and turned the corner , I got a jolt of adrenaline . <p> This figure in black was moving toward me . <p> Hey , Peter , it spoke , and then I knew it was Julie-her features seemed to pop into focus . <p> Funny , the figure had seemed huge until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . She had on a black blazer , a black tank top , black tights , and black sharp-toed boots . Her hair was done up . in a high ponytail , her face was pale-Julie always made a point of staying out of the sun  --  and her mouth was a slash of crimson lipstick . <p> Julie , I said , I did n't hear you come in . You scared me . I kept my voice down ; I did n't want to get her started yelling at me again . <p> She walked right up to me , keeping her hands jammed down in the pockets of her blazer . Rang the doorbell several times , she said , staring me straight in the eye , as was her way . The door was cracked a bit . So I thought I 'd better just check . Did n't want to miss you , Peter , she said , after going to all the trouble of coming over here . <p> What am supposed to say to that ? said . All of a sudden it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . <p> Whatever , she said , smiling sort of to herself and leaning to one side to peek around behind me . Nice house you 've got here , Peter . Not like I imagined it at all . You should have brought me over here . I 'd have had a better opinion of you . <p> I kept quiet , mostly because I could n't figure out what Julie had in mind . There 's this odd thing about her , or about me and her . I 'm six-two and weigh right around one-eighty ; she 's five-three and does n't weigh more than a pound or two over a hundred . So let 's say I 'm almost twice as big as she is . She was never intimidated . <p> I do n't mean that I ever wanted her to be scared of me . But one thing I figured out from being on the tour . Size has everything to do with relationships . The advantage always starts out with the bigger person , but of course that can be changed . Little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their place . There were n't that many players on the tour who were bigger than me . <p> I 'm used to automatically acknowledging physical differences with women in the ways we stand next to each other and look and speak  --  the tones of voice we use . But Julie Munroe apparently never learned this basic principle . <p> At first it had annoyed me that she 'd stand or sit a little closer to me than anybody else would in a similar situation  --  as if she were the larger person , and I ought to be the one to make room . Damn nervy woman . Then all of a sudden that nerve of hers got to be attractive . At work I 'd seek her out because there was this energy that came from her , or that was generated by the two of us crowding each other 's space . The charge I got from being around her was what started the whole thing . <p> But right then , in the upstairs hallway of my house , I was back to . being annoyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the intrusion . They 'd be moving for the steps to head downstairs and giving me all available slack . <p> Julie actually nudged me over a bit with the back of her hand on my arm and walked past me toward the steps up to the attic . What 's up here , Peter ? she asked , not turning to look back at me . <p> There was that certain quietness in her tone that in the old days I 'd learned to recognize as a signal . You want to come over to my place for lunch , Peter ? she 'd say in that tone . <p> But I could also feel how brittle her mood was . If I did n't humor her , I 'd have a hundred pounds of trouble in my house . <p> I have a little study up there , I said . You want to see ? <p> Without replying , she started up the narrow staircase to the third floor . Following her , I was forced to take note of her purposeful steps , her trim back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time of day the skylight makes my office one of the brightest rooms I 've ever been in . The space is actually a small one , but when you come up into it out of that claustrophobic staircase , your immediate sensation is one of having entered a large airy room . <p> Julie took off her blazer and casually dropped it to the floor . Maybe she thought I 'd pick it up for her . I did n't . <p> Warm up here , she said , still keeping her back to me , walking toward the shelves as if she were taking a tour of the place . In all that light and in her black tank top and tights , her arms and shoulders looked pale as a statue 's . <p> Have a seat , Julie , I told her . I sat down in my desk chair . Because I was so caught up with all my work , I did n't mind indulging her , but I definitely wanted to put the situation back into a proper balance . <p> No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pace around the periphery of the room , picking up one thing and another from the tops of my shelves . I 've been thinking some about us , Peter . I thought it would be good if we talked . <p> Julie , I began , there 's just no  --  <p> I 'm not talking about starting up again Julie spun around to face me . Rosy streaks appeared in her cheeks , on her neck , around her collarbone . I 'm talking about ... She turned away then , and raised her hands as if to pluck the words from the air around her head . <p> I waited , but she could n't find what she wanted to say . Her hands dropped to her sides . She turned her back again and slightly bowed her head . <p> What , Julie ? I said softly . Something about her ponytail catching the light was about to make me feel sorry for her . <p> She spun again and stepped quickly and directly toward me . Turn around , she said . <p> What ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I would n't have obeyed anybody else in that situation , but Julie was so obviously volatile right then that I did n't want to cross her unless it became absolutely necessary . <p> She set her hands on my shoulders and began a hard massage that was just too familiar . <p> Do n't do this , Julie , I said . This was how we always began at her apartment . In her quiet tone she would ask me if I needed my back rubbed , and I would say yes , yes , that was what I needed . We would walk silently toward her waterbed . Then it would start . Just this way . Now her touch felt profoundly wrong , as if in busy traffic I 'd suddenly been instructed to start driving through red lights . <p> Julie did n't stop . Her hands and fingers are amazingly strong , and she is a ruthless , deep-muscle massager . Her back rubs are like no others I have ever experienced  --  pleasurable , yes , but almost too painful to bear . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lean forward , Julie said . Automatically I did so . Previously we 'd joked about these back rubs being her power move . Now I understood exactly how powerful they were . To make her stop what she was doing , I would have had to steel myself against her , mentally and physically . <p> Raise your arms , Julie said and lightly slapped my back . When I did as she said , she jerked my shirt up and peeled it over my head and arms . She let it fall . <p> Julie , I said . <p> She went on . <p> There was this pause . Her tank top fell to the floor beside my polo shirt . <p> Topless now , she walked around to face me . Julie 's breasts are small and muscular . Now her nipples were sharply erect , and I was shaken by the look of her torso .. Her body was as intimidating as a wrestler 's . <p> Put your knees together , she said . <p> When I did , she straddled them and sat down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except that now she also worked on the muscles of my arms , neck , and chest . Looking up at her serious face , the hard red slash of her lips , I had the crazy notion that she was extracting strength from my body . Her face came nearer and nearer . <p> When she did kiss me , it was with a tenderness that I would n't have expected from Julie . For that reason I did n't resist as perhaps I might have , had she tried to force me that way , too . Her thumbs brushing across my nip.pies , too , were gentler than any touch she 'd used on me so far . <p> I never liked you , Julie said , but in that quiet tone that was like humming . Your body was all I ever liked . Skinny , long-muscled tennis player 's body that is n't worth a damn for anything but playing tennis and sex . That 's all you 're good for , Peter . <p> While she chanted that way to me , she pulled herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheeks , my chin , my mouth . I confess I wanted to let my mouth respond as it ordinarily would have to Julie 's doing that . I willed myself not to . <p> But her hand plunged down to my crotch . There was n't anything I could do about that part of my body 's response to her . <p> Julie , I said . <p> But she was smiling at me now , a clearly triumphant smile . <p> And undoing my belt and my trousers . <p> Julie do n't , I said , and I started to stand up . <p> Do n't you , she said , and she actually thumped me in the ribs with the soft side of her fist . It was n't a hard punch  --  maybe it surprised me more than anything else and just slightly knocked the wind out of me . It definitely stopped me from standing up . <p> She went on with what she was doing . Her advantage was that she knew my body , knew what to do . I wo n't say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Julie was in complete control of what was going on between us . <p> Now stand up , she said . When I did n't do it immediately , she put her hands at my neck just beneath my ears and took hold and pulled up-ward in such a way that I felt half afraid that she 'd snap my neck if I did n't follow her wishes . I stood up enough for her to push my pants and underwear down . <p> Julie , I do n't want this , I said , but my idiotic bobbing erection mocked my words even as I spoke them . <p> Stay put , she said and stood and pulled off her boots and pushed down her tights and underwear and stepped out of them . She was fast at this  --  there was this quick look I had of her turning in the skylight 's block of light . <p> Then she was back at me again , straddling me , pushed up close against me and using one hand to press my head against her chest and the other to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought of fighting her , and I chose not to . I wish now that I had , even though I know it would have been bloody . <p> When she found the fit , her coming down onto me was such a shock I could n't help calling out . I wondered if anyone would have heard my voice . <p> Once she had me inside her , it was as if I had become the small person and she the large . Her hands took hold of each side of my head and she pressed her breast into my face . <p> Your mouth , son of a bitch , she said . Use your mouth . <p> I wanted it over with , which was what Julie seemed to want , too , except that she was really into it . She used both me and her hand , and she came with a yelp . She pitched upward twice more before locking herself tightly against me with her body shaking . Then she pulled away and stood up , breathing hard while she stared down at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I could n't do anything about it . <p> Dumb fuck , she said . <p> Then she started dressing . She took her time , as if this were her place instead of mine . After a while , it was just too humiliating to sit there with my pants around my knees . I stood and pulled them up , then bent for my shirt and put it on . <p> I wished she had beaten me with her fists , so that I could have hated her the way I wanted to . There was nothing I could say to her , though it seemed I had to watch her every gesture . <p> She used a compact and lipstick from her blazer pocket . She put them back , then used both hands to pull her ponytail tight . All the while her face and eyes ignored me . At the same time the way she moved her body told me over and over again , I had you , sucker , I had you . <p> Patting her pockets , looking around as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally walked over to the staircase and gave me a final glance . <p> Now it 's finished , Peter , she said . Her bootsteps going down the staircase were slow and loud . <p> In a moment I heard  --  or rather felt in the shaking of the attic floor  --  the front door slam . When I knew I was absolutely alone , I actually tried to force water to come down out of my eyes . I felt this need to let go of what I 'd just been through . Crying was the only thing I could think of that might do it . <p> My attempts to sob sounded ridiculous . And I did n't want to do anything else I could think of . Call Susan ? Call the police ? Call Ben Fulton ? <p> When I finally came down to the second floor that day , I touched the walls of the hallways and looked into my kids ' bedrooms as I walked slowly past them . I ran my hand along the banister as I came down to the first floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have looked like to Julie when she came into the empty foyer , figured out that I was upstairs somewhere , and decided to go up there and find me . <p> I set my hand on the newel post and thought hard . When I had first gone over to Julie 's place , I 'd followed her in , right into that immaculate living room of hers with small , framed pictures on each white wall and one bright-covered magazine in the center of a glass coffee table . I looked at all that polished wooden floor and thought to myself , So this is how she lives . She kept quiet  --  I did , too  --  while she walked me through her dining area , her kitchen , her workout space , and her bedroom . We 'd said it was lunch we were there for . I stood staring down at her jungle-printed bedspread while she paced toward the window . When she turned , faced me , and asked me what I thought , I knew from her voice that the question was important , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So this is where you live , Julie ? While she waited for me to go on , there was a little smile on Julie 's face , almost a bashful expression , but that faded . She shrugged . Yeah , this is it , she said . There had definitely been a topic there for us to discuss , but in a minute or two we 'd forgotten all about it . <p> <p> By DAVID HUDDLE <p>
