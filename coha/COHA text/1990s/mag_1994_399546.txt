Inflation is poison for stocks  --  most stocks , anyway . There are a few market sectors , however , that actually benefit when inflation starts ratcheting up . You ought to be aware of them  --  and consider adding such stocks to your portfolio today in anticipation of higher inflation tomorrow . Not surprisingly , a lot of investors have been neglecting these stocks , which typically are the shares of companies that produce natural resources or own large amounts of land . As inflation fell from 14% in 1980 to less than 3% currently , inflation stocks were duds until recently . They lagged the Dow Jones industrial average by as much as 7.5 percentage points from 1989 through 1991 ( see the chart on the opposite page ) . ( chart omitted ) Since 1992 , however , these stocks have outperformed the Dow by as much as 13.8 points because investors started expecting an inflation revival . Even though consumer prices rose at only a 2.5% annual rate in the first half of this year , there are now clear signs that the 14-year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inflation is at an 11-year high , " says James B. Stack , editor of the newsletter Investech Market Analyst ( $175 ; 406-862-7777 ) , referring to a well-known index compiled by Columbia University 's Center for International Business Cycle Research . He sees inflation rising to around 5% by the end of 1995 . Experts who share Stack 's view cite other warning signs that inflation will rise over the next two years , such as strong growth in some measures of the money supply , a recent upturn in real estate prices , and higher oil prices resulting in part from the strike by oil workers in Nigeria . Our own view is n't quite so pessimistic , but we do expect to see consumer prices climbing at a 4% to 5% rate by the end of 1996 . Here 's a look at five companies that would be major beneficiaries of a long-term rise in inflation . All five trade on the New York Stock Exchange and are recommended for potential returns , including dividends , of 18% or more over the next 18 months . Placer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $20.25 with a 1.3% yield ) . Gold has been investors ' traditional inflation hedge , but gold-mining shares can perform even better . Reason : Inflation not only raises the value of a mine 's current production but also that of future production . Created in 1987 through the merger of Placer Development , Dome Mines and Campbell Red Lake , Placer Dome now ranks as one of the world 's premier gold producers with $970 million revenues this year . Analyst J. Clarence Morrison at Prudential Securities in New York City recommends the stock because the company is aggressively boosting its gold output from a current 1.8 million ounces a year . " Placer Dome could reach 2.2 million ounces by 1996 , " says Morrison . Analyst Vahid Fathi at Kemper Securities in Chicago also likes Placer Dome because of its success finding new reserves . Recent discoveries include Las Cristinas in Venezuela , which could hold 4 million ounces of gold Moreover , says Fathi , " the Las Cristinas discovery could ultimately contain nearly twice as much gold as is currently estimated . " He expects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinks Placer Dome stock will easily surpass $40 a share within 18 months , a 98% gain from here . Schlumberger ( SLB ; $60 ; 2% ) . Although oil can be an excellent long-term investment when inflation is rising , the price of crude is already up 43% to $20 a barrel so far this year , and most analysts see little room for further gains over the next 12 months . Instead , investors would be wise to consider the shares of oil service companies such as $6.8 billion Schlumberger . " When the price of crude goes up , oil companies increase their drilling and exploration budgets for projects that were n't economically sound at lower prices , " explains analyst John Hilton at Argus Research in New York City . Further , Schlumberger is a technological leader . " By itself , the company accounts for half the industry 's research and development budget , " says analyst James Carroll at Paine Webber in New York City . He projects that Schlumberger 's profits can grow about 15% annually over the next five years and expects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Georgia-Pacific ( GP ; $69.25 ; 2.3% ) . " The amount of wood in the world ca n't be increased rapidly , so its value would go up in an inflationary environment , " explains analyst Chip Dillon at Salomon Bros. in New York City . That would drive up the price of lumber , paper and containerboard for boxes , and the profits of forest-products companies would soar . With 6 million acres in North America , $13 billion Georgia-Pacific is the world 's largest forest-products company . Equally important , paper companies are on an upswing in their business cycle . " We 're seeing a recovery from the worst down cycle in paper products in 50 years , " says analyst Mark Rogers at Prudential Securities in New York City . Georgia-Pacific , for instance , lost money in ' 92 and earned less than a quarter a share last year . For 1994 , however , the analysts see earnings of $2.50 to $2.90 a share , which could double next year and ramp up to $7 to $10 a share by ' 97 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock could rise 30% to $90 over the next 18 months . Equity Residential ( EQR ; $31.50 ; 6.3% ) . Rising inflation pushes up interest rates and makes single-family homes less affordable . That , in turn , forces more people to rent rather than buy , explains analyst Louis Taylor at Prudential Securities in New York City . For that reason , he recommends Equity Residential , a real estate investment trust ( market capitalization : $1.2 billion ) that owns 34,000 apartments nationwide , with its biggest holdings in Florida , Texas and Virginia . Another plus , says analyst James Wilson at Montgomery Securities in San Francisco , is that apartment prices are climbing rapidly right now . " Gains are currently running 5% to 7% annually , " he says . The REIT has also taken advantage of the weak real estate market of the past three years to acquire underperforming buildings . Since June 1993 , in fact , it has doubled in size and could add another 20,000 apartments , a gain of almost 60% , over the next two years , says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earnings could grow at a double-digit annual rate through 1997 . And they think the Equity Residential stock could rise to $40 over the next 18 months . Including its hefty 6.3% yield , that would equal a 36% total return . Dow Chemical ( DOW ; $71 ; 3.7% ) . Like other commodities , the prices of chemicals tend to rise rapidly with inflation . And since $19.7 billion Dow is vertically integrated  --  that is , it not only sells bulk chemicals such as polyethylene but also uses them to manufacture consumer goods , such as Ziploc bags  --  the company would benefit more than many of its competitors , explains analyst Paul Raman at S.G. Warburg in New York City . " A one-percentage-point price increase would ultimately produce a 16% gain on Dow 's bottom line , " he figures . Dow is also a great play on a global economic expansion , says analyst Robert Niemeyer at PNC Bank in Philadelphia . Half the company 's sales , in fact , are outside the U.S. , with the largest share in Europe . Raman estimates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $3.75 next year and $5 in 1996 . And he expects the stock to reach $80 over the next 18 months . Given the stock 's above-average 3.7% yield , that would be at least an 18% return for shareholders-more than enough to keep you comfortably ahead of any likely inflation in the next few years . <p>
