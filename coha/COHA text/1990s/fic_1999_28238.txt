Excerpt : Chapter One This was not my idea . I want that clearly understood right at the outset . The notion that any one person can describe " what really happened " is an absurdity . If ten -- or a hundred -- people witness an event , there will be ten -- or a hundred -- different versions of what took place . What we see and how we interpret it depends entirely upon our individual past experience . My mother , however , has insisted that I undertake this ridiculous chore , and I will , as always , do as she tells me to do . The more I 've thought about it , though , the more I 've come to realize that when Ce'Nedra first broached the subject to me , and later to my mother , her obviously specious argument about " the well-being of the young " actually had more merit than the devious little girl realized . One day Geran will be the Rivan King and the Guardian of the Orb , and over the centuries I 've found that people with at least a nodding acquaintance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do n't repeat the mistakes of the past . If all Geran and his sons really needed to rule the Rivans were to be a flat recounting of the deeds of assorted rulers of assorted kingdoms in ages past , the tiresome repetition of the " and then , and then , and then " that so delights the stodgy members of the Tolnedran Historical Society would be more than sufficient . As my daughter-in-law so cunningly pointed out , however , the " and then " s of those Tolnedran scholars deal with only a part of the world . There 's another world out there , and things happen in that other world that Tolnedrans are constitutionally incapable of comprehending . Ultimately it will be this unseen world that the Rivan King must know if he is to properly perform his task . Even so , I could have devoutly maintained that my father 's long-winded version of the history of our peculiar world had already filled in that obvious gap . I even went so far as to reread Father 's tedious story , trying very hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have nothing to add . Soon Father 's glaring omissions began to leap off the page at me . The old fraud had n't told the whole story , and Mother knew it . In Father 's defense , however , I 'll admit that there were events that took place when he was n't present and others during which he did n't fully understand what was really happening . Moreover , some of the omissions which so irritated me as I read along had their origin in his desire to compress seven thousand years of history into something of manageable length . I 'll forgive him those lapses , but could n't he at least have gotten names and dates right ? For the sake of keeping peace in the family , I 'll gloss over his imperfect memory of just who 'd said what in any given conversation . Human memory -- and that 's assuming that my father 's human -- is never really all that exact , I suppose . Why do n't we just say that Father and I remember things a little differently and let it go at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you go along . Do n't waste your time -- and mine -- by pointing out assorted variations . The more I read , the more I came to realize that things I know and father does n't would be essential parts of Geran 's education . Moreover , a probably hereditary enthusiasm for a more complete story began to come over me . I tried to fight it , but it soon conquered me . I discovered that I actually want to tell my side of the story . I have a few suspicions about the origins of my change of heart , but I do n't think this is the place to air them . The central fact of my early life was my sister Beldaran . We were twins , and in some respects even closer than twins . To this very day we 're still not apart . Beldaran , dead these three thousand years and more , is still very much a part of me . I grieve for her loss every day . That might help to explain why I sometimes appear somber and withdrawn . Father 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile . What 's there to smile about , Old Wolf ? As Father pointed out , I 've read extensively , and I 've noticed that biographies normally begin at birth . Beldaran and I , however , began just a bit earlier than that . For reasons of her own , Mother arranged it that way . So now , why do n't we get started ? It was warm and dark , and we floated in absolute contentment , listening to the sound of Mother 's heart and the rush of her blood through her veins as her body nourished us . That 's my first memory -- that and Mother 's thought gently saying to us , " Wake up . " We 've made no secret of Mother 's origins . What is n't widely known is the fact that the Master summoned her , just as he summoned all the rest of us . She 's as much Aldur 's disciple as any of the rest of us are . We all serve him in our own peculiar ways . Mother , however , was not born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Beldaran anxd I had none of those instincts that are inborn in wolves . I 've since learned that this caused her much concern , and she consulted with the Master at some length about it , and her suggested solution was eminently practical . Since Beldaran and I had no instincts , Mother proposed to the Master that she might begin our education while we were still enwombed . I think her suggestion might have startled Aldur , but he quickly saw its virtue . And so it was that mother took steps to make certain that my sister and I had certain necessary information -- even before we were born . During the course of a normal human pregnancy , the unborn lives in a world consisting entirely of physical sensation . Beldaran and I , however , were gently guided somewhat further . My father rather arrogantly states that he began my education after Beldaran 's wedding , but that 's hardly accurate . Did he really think that I was a vegetable before that ? My education -- and Beldaran's -- began before we ever saw the light of day . Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he 'd been obliged to oversee the early education of my various uncles . He forced them to think and to argue as a means of guiding them along the thorny path to independent thought -- although he sometimes carried it to extremes . Mother was born wolf , and her approach is more elemental . Wolves are pack animals , and they do n't think independently . Mother simply told Beldaran and me , " This is the way it is . This is the way it always has been , and always will be . " Father teaches you to question ; Mother teaches you to accept . It 's an interesting variation . At first , Beldaran and I were identical twins and as close at that term implies . When Mother 's thought woke us , however , she rather carefully began to separate us . I received certain instruction that Beldaran did n't , and she received lessons that I did n't . I think I felt that wrench more keenly than Beldaran did . She knew her purpose ; I spent years groping for mine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remember reaching out to my sister and saying to her in what would become our own private language , " You 're so far away now . " Actually , of course , we were n't ; we were both still confined in that small , warm place beneath mother 's heart . But our minds had always been linked before , and now they were inexorably moving apart . If you think about it a bit , I 'm sure you 'll understand . After we awoke , Mother 's thought was with us continually . The sound of it was as warm and comforting as the place where we floated , but the place nourished only our bodies . Mother 's thought nourished our minds -- with those subtle variations I previously mentioned . I suspect that what I was and what I have become is the result of that womb-dark period in my life when Beldaran and I floated in perfect sisterhood -- until Mother 's thought began to separate us . And then in time there was another thought as well . Mother had prepared us for that intrusion upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my sister and I had become more fully aware and conscious of our separation and some of the reasons for it , Aldur 's thought joined with Mother 's to continue our education . He patiently explained to us right at the outset why certain alterations were going to be necessary . My sister and I had been identical . Aldur changed that , and most of the alterations were directed at me . Some of the changes were physical -- the darkening of my hair , for example -- and others were mental . Mother had begun that mental division , and Aldur refined it . Beldaran and I were no longer one . We were two . Beldaran 's reaction to our further separation was one of gentle regret . Mine was one of anger . I rather suspect that my anger may have been a reflection of Mother 's reaction when my vagrant father and a group of Alorns chose to slip away so that they could go off to Mallorea to retrieve the Orb that Torak had stolen from the Master . I now fully understand why it was necessary and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think . But at the time she was absolutely infuriated by what , in the society of wolves , was an unnatural desertion . My somewhat peculiar relationship with my father during my childhood quite probably derived from my perception of Mother 's fury . Beldaran was untouched by it , since Mother wisely chose to shield her from that rage . A vagrant and somewhat disturbing thought just occurred to me . As I mentioned earlier , Father 's educational technique involves questioning and argumentation , and I was probably his star pupil . Mother teaches acceptance , and Beldaran received the full benefit of that counsel . In a strange sort of way this would indicate that I 'm my father 's true daughter , and Beldaran was Mother 's . All right , Old Wolf . Do n't gloat . Wisdom eventually comes to all of us . Someday it might even be your turn . Mother and the Master gently told my sister and me that once we were born , Mother would have to leave us in the care of others so that she could pursue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be well cared for , and , moreover , that Mother 's thought would be with us more or less continually , even as it had been while we were still enwombed . We accepted that , though the notion of physical separation was a little frightening . The important thing in our lives from the moment that our awareness had awakened , though , had been the presence of Mother 's thought , and as long as that would still be with us , we were sure that we 'd be all right . For a number of reasons it was necessary for me to be born first . Aldur 's alterations of my mind and my personality had made me more adventurous than Beldaran anyway , so it was natural for me to take the lead , I suppose . It was actually an easy birth , but the light hurt my eyes right at first , and the further separation from my sister was extremely painful . In time , however , she joined me , and all was well again . Mother 's thought -- and Aldur's -- were still with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm assuming here that most of you have read my father 's " History of the World . " In that occasionally pompous monologue he frequently mentioned " The humorous old fellow in the rickety cart . " It was n't long after Beldaran and I were born that he paid us a call . Although his thought had been with us for months , that was the first time we actually saw the Master . He communed with us for a time , and when I looked around , a sudden panic came over me . Mother was gone . " It 's all right , Polgara , " Mother 's thought came to me . " This is necessary . The Master has summoned one who 'll care for you and your sister . That one is short and twisted and ugly , but his heart 's good . It 'll be necessary to deceive him , I 'm afraid . He must believe that I 'm no longer alive . No one -- except you and Beldaran -- must know that it 's not true . The one who sired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go . He 'll travel more quickly without the distraction of my presence . " And that 's how Uncle Beldin entered our lives . I ca n't be entirely sure what the Master told him , but he wept a great deal during those first few days . After he got his emotions under control , he made a few tentative efforts to communicate with my sister and me . To be honest about it , he was woefully inept right at first , but the Master guided him , and in time he grew more proficient . Our lives -- my sister 's and mine -- were growing more crowded . We slept a great deal at first . Uncle Beldin was wise enough to put us in the same cradle , and as long as we were together , everything was all right . Mother 's thought was still with us -- and Aldur's -- and now Uncle Beldin 's , and we were still content . My sister and I had no real sense of the passage of time during our first few months . Sometimes it was light and sometimes dark . Beldin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together , so time did n't really mean very much to us . Then , after what was probably weeks , there were two others as well , and their thought joined with the ones which were already familiar . Our other two uncles , Beltira and Belkira , had entered our lives . I 've never fully understood why people have so much difficulty telling Beltira and Belkira apart . To me , they 've always been separate and distinct from each other , but I 'm a twin myself , so I 'm probably a little more sensitive to these variations . Beldaran and I had been born in midwinter , and Uncle Beldin had moved us to his own tower not long afterward , and it was in that tower that we spent our childhood . It was about midsummer of our first year when father finally returned to the Vale . Beldaran and I were only about six months old at the time , but we both recognized him immediately . Mother 's thought had placed his image in our minds before we were ever born . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my mind when Beldin lifted me from my cradle and handed me to the vagabond who 'd sired me . I was n't particularly impressed with him , to be honest about it , but that prejudice may have been the result of Mother 's bitterness about the way he 'd deserted her . Then he laid his hand on my head in some ancient ritual of benediction , and the rest of my mind suddenly came awake as his thought came flooding in on me . I could feel the power coming from his hand , and I seized it eagerly . This was why I 'd been separated from Beldaran ! At last I realized the significance of that separation . She was to be the vessel of love ; I was to be the vessel of power ! The mind is limitless in certain ways , and so my father was probably unaware of just how much I took from him in that single instant when his hand touched my head . I 'm fairly sure that he still does n't fully understand just exactly what passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took from him in no way diminished him , but it increased me a hundredfold . Then he took up Beldaran , and my fury also increased a hundredfold . How dared this traitor touch my sister ? Father and I were not getting off to a good start . And then came the time of his madness . I was still not familiar enough with human speech to fully understand what Uncle Beldin told him that drove him to that madness , but Mother 's thought assured me that he 'd survive it -- eventually . Looking back now , I realize that it was absolutely essential for Mother and Father to be separated . I did n't understand at the time , but Mother 's thought had taught me that acceptance is more important than understanding . During the time of my father 's insanity , my uncles frequently took my sister to visit him , and that did n't improve my opinion of him . He became in my eyes a usurper , a vile man out to steal Beldaran 's affection away from me . Jealousy is n't a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in children , so I wo n't dwell here on exactly how I felt each time my uncles took Beldaran away from me to visit that frothing madman chained to his bed in that tower of his . I remember , though , that I protested vociferously -- at the top of my lungs -- whenever they took Beldaran away . And that was when Beldin introduced me to " the puzzle . " I 've always thought of it as that . In a peculiar sort of way " the puzzle " almost came to take on a life of its own for me . I ca n't be entirely certain how Beldin managed it , but " the puzzle " was a gnarled and twisted root of some low-growing shrub -- heather , perhaps -- and each time I took it up to study it , it seemed to change . I could quite clearly see one end of it , but I could never find the other . I think that " the puzzle " helped to shape my conception of the world and of life itself . We know where one end is -- the beginning -- but we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with endless hours of entertainment , though , and that gave Uncle Beldin a chance to get some rest . I was studying " the puzzle " when Father came to Uncle Beldin 's tower to say his good-byes . Beldaran and I were perhaps a year and a half old -- or maybe a little younger -- when he came to the tower and kissed Beldaran . I felt that usual surge of jealousy , but I kept my eyes firmly fixed on " the puzzle , " hoping he 'd go away . And then he picked me up , tearing my attention away from what I was working on . I tried to get away from him , but he was stronger than I was . I was hardly more than a baby , after all , although I felt much older . " Stop that , " he told me , and his tone seemed irritable . " You may not care much for the idea , Pol , but I 'm your father , and you 're stuck with me . " And then he kissed me , which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt his pain , and my heart softened toward him . " No , " Mother 's thought came to me , " not yet . " At the time , I thought it was because she was still very angry with him and that I was to be the vessel of her anger . I know now I was mistaken . Wolves simply do n't waste time being angry . My father 's remorse and sorrow had not yet run their course , and the Master still had many tasks for him . Until he had expiated what he felt to be his guilt , he 'd be incapable of those tasks . My misunderstanding of Mother 's meaning led me to do something I probably should n't have done . I struck out at him with " the puzzle . " " Spirited , is n't she ? " he murmured to Uncle Beldin . Then he put me down , gave me a little pat on the bottom , which I scarcely felt , and told me to mind my manners . I certainly was n't going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any way had made me change my opinion of him , so I turned , still holding " the puzzle " like a club , and glared at him . " Be well , Polgara , " he told me in the gentlest way imaginable . " Now go play . " He probably still does n't realize it , but I almost loved him in that single instant -- almost , but not quite . The love came later , and it took years . It was not long after that that he turned and left the Vale , and I did n't see him again for quite a number of years
