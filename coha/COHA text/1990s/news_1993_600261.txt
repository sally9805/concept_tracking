<p> In his days with the Detroit Tigers , Bill Freehan had a knack for getting hit by the pitch . <p> How fitting , then , that he should lean in and take one for his alma mater , the University of Michigan . <p> The former All-Star catcher gave up a successful business career in 1989 to shepherd the Wolverines baseball team through an unprecedented probation that ended this season . <p> It might have seemed like a hard move to fathom four years ago . And harder now , with Michigan mired at 5-22 . <p> Coaching college baseball can be trying even in the best of circumstances . Top recruits frequently opt for the pros : Shortstop Derek Jeter , the USA 's No. 1 high school player last year , committed to Michigan , then signed with the New York Yankees . Many others defect during their college careers . <p> Yet Freehan , 51 , wanted in , despite the speed bumps ahead . Ask him to explain , and he levels his gunmetal-blue stare and shrugs . <p> " You ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says . <p> " I 'm not doing this as a stepping-stone to a major league job . I 'm trying to teach . To expose the players to things and have an impact on their lives , socially , academically , competitively . " <p> Jim Price , Freehan 's big-league understudy and now Tigers community relations director , says the move came as no shock to ex-teammates . <p> " We nicknamed him Big Ten Bill , because he was always such a rah-rah college guy , " Price says . " ' Michigan ' was on his forehead . <p> " I 'm not sure he knew some of the things he 'd have to do , like take the tarp off the field himself . But he loves the college atmosphere . " <p> Some people contend he 's the only person who could have kept the program from splintering like a cracked bat meeting a fastball . <p> " He was the ideal individual , " says Michigan athletic director Jack Weidenbach . <p> " I do n't think he was quite ready to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some ways . But his commitment to the institution was such that he did it . Quickly . " <p> Weather and scheduling quirks forced the Wolverines to play 26 of their first 27 games on the road . Their spring swing through Florida , Alabama , Oklahoma and Louisiana included 13 games against Top 25 teams . <p> They lost to Eastern Michigan at home , then dropped eight in a row against Minnesota and Purdue in Big Ten play . <p> Yet Freehan and the players remain upbeat . <p> " We 're playing top-notch teams and competing with them , " says senior shortstop/catcher Scott Winterlee . <p> Freehan says he has been able to ride out the losses because of past accomplishments . <p> " If I was a young coach trying to make a mark , it would be different , " he says . " Not that I like the losing . " <p> Freehan excelled at football and baseball at Michigan . The Tigers signed him for a $ 100,000 bonus after his sophomore year in 1961 . He attended school part-time and earned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal with my dad was , I did n't see a dime of my bonus until I got my degree , " Freehan says . " I tell parents , ' Make that deal with your kid . ' " <p> Freehan was an 11-time All-Star and five-time Gold Glove winner . In 1968 , the year the Tigers won the World Series , he tied a season mark by being hit by a pitch 24 times - three in one game . <p> He retired in 1976 and ran an auto manufacturer 's representative agency in suburban Detroit with ex-teammate Jim Northrup . <p> Meanwhile , Michigan baseball coach Bud Middaugh presided over a golden era . From 1980-89 , the Wolverines compiled a .761 winning percentage , six Big Ten championships and four trips to the College World Series . <p> Ann Arbor became a leading Rust Belt exporter of big-league talent , delivering , among others , Barry Larkin , Chris Sabo and Hal Morris ( Cincinnati Reds ) and Jim Abbott ( Yankees ) . <p> But in 1989 , the foundations crumbled . Middaugh resigned under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funneled $ 82,000 to his players , mostly by paying them to sell football programs . <p> Penalties included a recruiting ban , a freeze on scholarships and an order to repay more than $ 42,000 in postseason gate receipts . <p> Freehan was the only candidate to replace Middaugh as coach . Once there , he found the probation acted like a time-release capsule . The talent he inherited from Middaugh was good enough for 33-24 and 34-23 records . Any player could have transferred without penalty , but none , including nine players drafted by major league teams , chose to leave . <p> " I signed my letter of intent in April , and I did n't find out about the problems until freshman orientation in July , " says senior co-captain Scott Timmerman . " I was a little upset , to say the least . <p> " But all the guys who were drafted decided to stay . They felt Freehan had the contacts to help them in their pro careers . I stuck with it , and I 'm happy . " <p> The last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including Freehan 's first recruiting class , finished 21-32 . <p> This year , " We have n't learned to win yet , " Freehan says . Michigan is 1-7 in one-run games . Four losses have come in the last at-bat . <p> " Nobody 's worried about the record , " Weidenbach says . " Bill has the program going in the right direction . " <p> Well , not nobody . Freehan wants it all - a clean , winning program . He 's still crowding the plate , looking for an edge . <p> " It 's been a challenge to keep our kids ' heads above water , " he says . " But I 'll work with them they way I think they should be worked with . I 'm a motivator , not an intimidator . I focus on what we do right .
