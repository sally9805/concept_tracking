Lake Wobegon I am a cheerful man , even in the dark , and it 's all thanks to a good Lutheran mother . When I was a boy , if I came around looking glum and mopey , she said , " What 's the matter ? Did the dog pee on your cinnamon toast ? " and the thought of our old black mutt raising his hind leg in the pas de dog and peeing on toast made me giggle . I was a beanpole boy , and my hair was the color of wet straw . I loved to read adventure books and ride my bike and shoot baskets in the driveway and tell jokes . My dad , Byron , was a little edgy , expecting the worst , saving glass jars and paper clips , turning off lights and cranking down the thermostat to keep our family out of the poorhouse , but Mother was well composed , a true Lutheran , and taught me to Cheer up , Make yourself useful , Mind your manners , and , above all , Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn to avoid self-pity as if it were poison ivy in the woods . Winter is not a personal experience ; everyone else is as cold as you are ; so do n't complain about it too much . Even if your cinnamon toast gets peed on . It could be worse . Being Lutheran , Mother believed that self-pity is a deadly sin and so is nostalgia , and she had no time for either . She had sat at the bedside of her beloved sister , Dotty , dying of scarlet fever in the summer of 1934 ; she held Dotty 's hand as the sky turned dark from their father 's fields blowing away in the drought , she cleaned Dotty , wiped her , told her stories , changed the sheets , and out of that nightmare summer she emerged stronger , confident that life would be wondrous , or at least bearable . I was named for my great-grandfather John Tollefson , who landed in Lake Wobegon , in the center of Minnesota , from Voss , Norway , in 1880 . Lake Wobegon was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for less than five dollars , you could get a tattoo , a glass of gin , and a social disease , and have enough left over to get in a poker game , but Lutherans civilized it . They were hard workers , indifferent to vice . John and his wife , Signe , came from Voss and begat Einar , and Einar and Birthe ( Birdy ) begat Byron , and Byron and Mary begat me , John , the third of five children , with Bill and Diana ahead of me and Ronnie ( Byron , Jr. ) and Judy after . It was a good place to grow up in , Lake Wobegon . Kids migrated around town as free as birds and did their stuff , put on coronations and executions in the long , dim train shed and the deserted depot , fought the Indian wars , made ice forts and lobbed grenades at each other , dammed up the spring melt in the gutters , swam at the beach raced bikes in the alley . You were free , but you knew how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elders , and if a lady you did n't know came by and told you to blow your nose , you blew it . Your parents sent you off to school with lunch money and told you to be polite and do what the teacher said , and if there was a problem at school , it was most likely your fault and not the school 's . Your parents were large and slow afoot and they did not read books about parenting , and when they gathered with other adults , at Lutheran church suppers or family get-togethers , they did n't talk about schools or about prevailing theories of child development . They did not weave their lives around yours . They had their own lives , which were mysterious to you . I remember the day I graduated from tricycle to shiny new two-wheeler , a big day . I wobbled down Green Street and made a U-turn and waved to Mother on the front porch , and she was n't there . She had tired of watching me and gone in . I was shocked at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onto McKinley Street , riding very fast so I would have big tales to tell her , and I raced down the hill past the Catholic church and the old black mutt ran out to greet me and I swerved and skidded on loose gravel and tumbled off the bike onto the pavement and skinned myself and lay on the tar , weeping , hoping for someone to come pick me up , but nobody came . The dog barked at me to get up . I limped three blocks home with skin scraped off my forearm and knee , my eyes brimming with tears , and when I came into the kitchen , she looked down at me and said , " It 's only a scrape . Go wash it off . You 're okay . " And when I had washed , she sat me down with a toasted cheese sandwich and told me the story of Wotan and Frigga . " Wotan , or Odin , was the father of the gods , and his wife , Frigga , was the earth goddess who brought summer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter god , and the god of peace was Frey . So from Odin we get Wednesday , from Thor , Thursday , from Frey , Friday -- Sunday and Monday , of course , refer to the sun and moon -- which leaves Saturday and Tuesday . Wotan and Frigga had a boy named Sidney , and Thor had a daughter named Toots , and they fell in love and one day Sidney went to find Toots and steal her away , but Thor sent a big wind and Sidney rode his bicycle too fast and fell and skinned his knee , and that 's why Saturday is a day off , so we can think about it and remember not to ride our bikes so fast . " She gave me a fresh soft peanut butter cookie . She wiped the last remaining tears from my cheek . She said , " Go outside and play . You 're all right . " In Lake Wobegon , you learned about being All Right . Life is complicated , so think small . You ca n't live life in raging torrents , you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you need drama , read Dickens . My dad said , " You ca n't plant corn and date women at the same time . It does n't work . " One thing at a time . The lust for world domination does not make for the good life . It 's the life of the raccoon , a swash-buckling animal who goes screaming into battle one spring night , races around , wins a mate , carries on a heroic raccoon career , only to be driven from the creekbed the next spring by a young stud who leaves teethmarks in your butt and takes away your girlfriend , and you lie wounded and weeping in the ditch . Later that night , you crawl out of the sumac and hurl yourself into the path of oncoming headlights . Your gruesome carcass lies on the hot asphalt to be picked at by crows . Nobody misses you much . Your babies grow up and do the same thing . Nothing is learned . This is a life for bank robbers . It is not a life for sensible people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urge . Inevitable tragedy . A sensible person seeks to be at peace , to read books , know the neighbors , take walks , enjoy his portion , live to be eighty , and wind up fat and happy , although a little wistful when the first coronary walks up and slugs him in the chest . Nobody is meant to be a star . Charisma is pure fiction , and so is brilliance . It 's the dummies who sit on the dais , and it 's the smart people who sit in the dark near the exits . That is the Lake Wobegon view of life . When I was ten , I got absorbed in the Flambeau Family novels in the Lake Wobegon library and devoured them all in one summer , one by one , sequestered in my bedroom ( The Flambeaus and the Case of the Floating Barolo , and the Flippant Bellhop , and the Flying Bonbons , and the Floral Bouquet , the Flagrant Bagel , the Flamboyant Baritone , the Broadway Flop , the Flustered Beagle , and , finally , The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tony , a boy of Manhattan , and his socialite parents , Emile and Eileen . Tony is a junior at St. Trillin 's on West Eighty-ninth , All-City in tennis , an honor student , adored by his girlfriend , Valerie . Tony and his mother , an actress still beautiful at forty-one , and his father , the famed microbiologist , live happily together in their art-filled duplex apartment on the twentieth floor of the San Remo , overlooking Central Park , and solve crimes as they go about their elegant lives , hanging out in swank restaurants among high-rolling dudes and chantoozies , knowing who is real and who is from New Jersey . The neighbors across the hall , Elena and Malcolm Strathspey , a Scottish laird and his ballerina wife , come over for gimlets and to talk about ballet , opera , the O'Connell sculptures at the Guggenheim . For a boy whose dad ran the grain elevator in a small town where nobody had ever seen a ballet or knew a gimlet from a grommet , the Flambeaus were an inspiration . They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books , especially after I reshelved them under Foreign Language . Sometimes , descending the steps of school , I would raise my hand as I came to the curb and imagine a taxi screeching to a stop and a bald man with a cigar clenched between his teeth saying , " Where to , mac ? " " The San Remo . " " Yes , sir . " I put the Flambeaus aside as I got older . The miseries of adolescence somehow did not jibe with the Flambeau life , but in the back of my mind , I reserved New York for later consideration , after the tumult died down . Mother said , " John , you are not the first person who ever had hormones , so do n't picture this as a great tragedy . Get over it . You 're okay . " And I was okay . Mother and Dad were un-Flambeaulike ; they were reserved and did n't praise me for fear of spoiling me , and they did n't hug me beyond the age of six except sideways once or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and minded my manners and learned to be useful and did n't feel sorry for myself , and in my heart , I imagined myself possessing an Eastern elegance . And when I was thirty , I finally made it . It was a desperate move . I was escaping from a girl in Minneapolis who wanted me to marry her and fulfill her dreams and secure her happiness . Her name was Korlyss , she was small and dark and of a mournful disposition , we met at the University and clung to each other for ten years , afraid to give up on a bad investment , I guess . We lived in Prospect Park , a sort of intellectual pueblo east of campus , in a tiny walk-up apartment with scarred tables and gimpy chairs and pine plank bookcases crammed with paperbacks . I was a bartender at The Mixers on Seven Corners , a grad-student hangout , and I sold ads for Minnesota Orchestra programs and did an all-night classical music show on the University station , WLB , and spent a dreary year in graduate school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was waiting for me to get my feet on the ground so we could marry and be happy . I kept almost marrying her for ten years . She was an extremely nice person . And then , walking along the West River Road one October day when the Mississippi gorge was a carnival of red and orange , she announced she might be pregnant . It just happened , she did n't know how . " Do n't you love me ? " she said . Maybe I did , but I did n't want to marry her . I offered her all the money I had , about five hundred dollars . She said , " I do n't want your money . " And the next morning , she packed a suitcase and three shopping bags and went to leave and the doorknob came off in her hand . " Maybe it 's a sign that we 're supposed to stay together , " she said . I fixed the doorknob and opened the door . I offered her a ride . " No , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the kitchen window and there she was on the sidewalk below , looking up at me , her baggage at her feet , as if she were Mimi in La Boheme . If only I would stick my head out the window and yell , " Okay ! I 'll marry you ! " then all the neighbors would stick their heads out of their windows and wave their arms and cheer , and the mailman would dance a jig , and the orange school bus would stop , and out would pop a children 's chorus to sing " When You Wish Upon a Star . " But I did n't . I was racked with guilt over Korlyss , believe me , especially when her friends called to say , " She really loves you , " and her mother called , weeping , to suggest counseling . It was the absolute rotten worst thing I had ever done to anybody . I felt sick . I knew I had to leave town . Through a Mixers patron , an Episcopal priest who was fond of Rusty Nails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , New York , on Cayuga Lake , had gotten an FM radio license and needed a manager to build a station . I flew out with a glowing recommendation written by the priest and another by me myself on the WLB letterhead , using the name Myra Groetz , and on the basis of the letters and a confident manner and a breezy interview over lunch and a good bottle of Beaujolais , I was hired for the job by Paul Burton , dean of students , a sleepy man with no chin , who for some reason was delegated to oversee WSJO . " I do n't know the first thing about radio except that I do n't care for it , " he said . " It 's noise , and it 's one big reason why most people in this country go around without an intelligent thought in their noggins . " St. James College is an Episcopalian outpost heavily endowed by Christian bandits of the nineteenth century , a liberal arts school that administers a light coating of education to students lured by fine architecture and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it smelled of richness . The groomed lawns , the oak trees with stone benches close around them , the trimmed hedges , the masses of ivy , the Georgian pillars of the administration building , Gilman Hall , and the curving stairs to the grand entrance , the lobby , a showroom of thick green carpet and rose-patterned sofas , and the dean 's office , a large sitting room carpeted in crimson , with a small Chippendale desk -- it all spoke well for the college 's fund-raisers . The college lay on the crest of a ridge like a royal park , a golf course hugging the campus on the south , the arboretum on the north , and , below it , the town of Red Cliff ( population 2,271 ) , on a gentle slant near the lovely blue eminence of Cayuga Lake . Among financially gifted parents of academically challenged students along the Eastern Seaboard , the college is known as St. Jude 's , after the patron saint of hopeless causes , a place where you can pack off your SPASM child ( Simply Pray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felony conviction , he or she will get to wear a black gown and attend graduation and receive a sheepskin with the St. James crest ( " Omnibus Omnia " ) on it . Tuition at St. James is equivalent to that at Harvard or Yale , on the theory that charity should not come cheap . Oil paintings of benefactors hung in the lobby of Gilman --  " the idiot children of the rich , " said the dean , as he gave me a quick tour -- and in the Bush Library , a four-story circular structure , concrete and brick and of a sturdy Bauhaus demeanor , with high beamed ceilings , the stacks dotted with study carrels , the building eerily empty , devoid of students . " They 're all watching reruns of Gilligan 's Island , " he said . I glanced through the stacks and saw six shelves of Dante 's Divine Comedy , four of Plato 's Dialogues , the Variorum Shakespeare , Goethe , Chekhov , Macaulay 's complete works five times over , all beautifully bound , all apparently unread . An entire room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both rooms majestic , with long oak tables and green-shaded lamps , both rooms deserted . " This is the place to come if you were looking to have an assignation , " he said . " You could romp naked in periodicals and copulate on the carpet , and the librarians would be grateful if , after climax , you took down a magazine and thumbed through it . " He gave me a baleful look . " We do n't need a radio station -- we need a literacy program . " I walked down the hill toward the lake . The grass really was greener here , and the foliage was denser , the trees and shrubs more various , than in Minnesota . The yards were more lush , and the standards of yard-keeping more relaxed . No Prussian horticulture , no home owners kneeling and trimming the borders with fingernail clippers . The lawns were clumpy , vegetation was allowed to loll , to spread , to luxuriate . I liked that . The houses were big , with big porches , vines climbing up the sides , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were deep . There were some dirt driveways with mud puddles -- another good sign -- and some leaning fences , and weather-beaten garages , a relief from the Scandinavian fastidiousness of back home . Here , people seemed to be appreciative of old things and could let them age and molder and crack . The old brick storefronts along Main Street that housed the usual college-town pizza parlors and sandwich shops and beer halls looked old , and the stoplights were old , from the forties , and hung over the intersections . Amazing , I thought . In Minnesota , county highway engineers would have torn those down long ago , replaced them with four $30,000 semaphores at each intersection , widened the street , and torn down every tree for a hundred feet , all in the interest of highway safety . Engineers run Minnesota , they designed it , they teach its children , and engineers are merciless men bent on the nullification of art and the worship of functionalism . The only new building in Red Cliff was a small brick box of a post office , which sat next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bakery , a Native American crafts store , a shop called Kathy 's Kitchen that sold very expensive jams and jellies , a candle store , and a massage therapist . The Red Cliff Inn occupied an old Greek Revival mansion on the lake side of Main Street , and the Red Cliff County Trust Company faced it , in a granite temple with four pink marble pillars . Next to it was the Embassy Bar and then Parker 's Antiques and then Colonial Laundromat and then a shallow creek flowing through a narrow rocky gorge . I stood and looked down the street and tried to imagine living here . The public library sat on the hill side of Main Street , in a crotchety brick mansion , and opposite was the Catholic church , St. Patrick 's , a cross atop its small , square belfry , and down the street was a prim white Methodist chapel and the gray stone castle of the Presbyterians . A Genesee Beer truck sat double-parked in front of the bar . A pretty young woman in a Doris Lessing T-shirt , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a young man with a wisp of beard , wearing a top hat and a paisley shirt and red-striped trousers -- obviously a drama student -- looked at me with a practiced sneer . Hey , I thought . Home at last . Two weeks later , I was back , in a rusted-out pink 1978 Oldsmobile , my clothes in the back seat , my books in the trunk . I rented an apartment ( " Carriagehouse : Elegant 1BR w EIK , oodles of charm " ) in what had been a garage , and went to work in a converted storage room in the college chapel , a refectory table for a desk . The college chapel was a long Gothic pile that seated a thousand , with stone stalactites and high ribbed vaults , flying buttresses adjoining the apse , dark timbers and stone carvings and pennants and banners , the goddesses of Art and Science and Literature peering down , and you felt as if footmen and courtiers might enter , followed by fawning gentry , plump lords and powdered ladies , sallow-faced princes , and the monarch himself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gout , come to kneel in prayer before attending the morning beheading . The Episcopal congregation of St. James was tiny , a few old ladies and a few hairy bison and me -- I began attending almost every Sunday , trying to make up for the dirty deed I had done to Korlyss . In this cathedral we Christians would be like BBs in a boxcar , so it was reserved for convocations and academic events and Christmas . We huddled every Sunday morning in a tiny basement chapel for Mass , celebrated by Mother Sally , a hearty , sixtyish woman , who marched down into the congregation during the Exchange of Peace and hugged everyone as if testing us for ripeness . She raced through the prayers to allow extra time for her homily . She seemed to believe that God spoke in an elaborate code intended to get Her message past St. Paul and the patriarchy of the early Church : the gist of it was that the Word is Womb , and the Womb is the Word . She was big on empowerment too . My first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there was the great relief of not marrying Korlyss , of leaving Minnesota , the divestment of accumulated regrets . I joined a coed volleyball league and acquired a pleasant girlfriend named Jean , a librarian , who was enthusiastic and came and went at convenient times and never mentioned marriage . Dean Burton was a great boss . If I could catch him in his drowsy time , after lunch , he would sign anything put in front of him : extradition papers , a check for a million dollars , a death warrant , anything . The radio antenna tower was built on a hill west of town , the studios were constructed on the fifth floor of Gridley Hall -- deep gray carpets , six-inch-thick soundproofed doors , cantilevered windows to reduce echo -- and staff was hired ( a gloomy bunch , I thought , rather Eeyorish , but okay for public radio ) and WSJO went on the air on Labor Day , 1985 , with a Mozart Marathon . President Postlethwaite came to switch on the transmitter , there were deans and faculty in full regalia , Mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I sat in my big office and raised a glass of champagne to our business manager , Marian MacKay . I liked her . She was from Houston , she had that hands-on-her-hips Texas Woman style , she was young and smart and black , and she could do black if she liked and play African queen -- and she also could whip through ten pages of budget figures and explain them to me in one sentence . On her resume , she listed the Sam Houston Institute of Technology . I like jokes like that from a woman . " To radio , " I said . " To Mozart . " " He 's the Moz . " We clinked glasses . " So how long you going to last here , baby ? " she said . I said that I was going to become a beloved old fart and stay until my eyebrows were as big as laboratory rats . She gave me a sad smile . " You remind me of that Sorry Mutha song , ' Why Do You Try So Hard to Get What You Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a better job than what I had before . She said , " Baby , you and me are just passing through . The difference is that I know it and you do n't . " One Sunday morning that September , before Mass , a man slipped into the pew next to me , a beefy man with a big head of permed brown hair , wearing a blue double-breasted suit and a blue shirt with a white collar . " Hi . How are ya doing ? " he said in a loud voice , reached over to pump my hand . Heads turned . I whispered : " Fine . " " Something wrong ? " he whispered . I shook my head . Just then the organist cut loose with the prelude , something harsh and loud and medieval . The man jumped . " Jesus Christ , " he said . He grinned at me and said , " Wow . Cool . " He seemed never to have attended an Anglican service before , did n't know a hymnal from a prayer book , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose to go forward for communion , he leaned over and whispered , " Where are you going ? " " Communion . " " Should I go too ? " I thought about this for a moment . I did n't want to have to give him instruction on how to receive the wafer , how much wine to drink . " Not this time , " I said . " Next time . Catch you later . " After Mass , we shook hands again . " Howard Freeman is the name , " he said . " New to town . Just started a law practice . Thought I 'd find a church . " We walked out into the sunshine and stood on the steps , looking across the lawn . " Interesting sermon . She seems to like the word ' context , ' does n't she , " Howard said . " She is very much a contextual person , " I said . " She can contextualize with the best of them . " " I must admit , I 'm here looking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Howard . " I 've always meditated , but I thought maybe I needed something more disciplined . " He looked at me confidentially . " Dumb-question alert : okay ? Christianity believes in an afterlife , right ? Or am I getting it confused with something else ? Like Catholicism ? " I tried to explain about heaven . The Last Judgment . It was interesting to catechize a man my own age . Like explaining baseball to a European . We walked to Howard 's car , and I invited him to play racquetball sometime at the Faculty Club . In Minnesota , you can issue invitations knowing that people will politely decline them , but Howard said , " Sure , how about tomorrow ? " and he turned out to be a bull on the court . He won three games by wide margins , and I could n't very well turn down his offer of a rematch without looking like a wimp , and so we became Monday regulars . One day , sitting in the steam room , he told me about a house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sale , cheap . " The owner is a lady drama professor named Sanders , who got canned for seducing a student , " said Howard , " who happens to be the daughter of the guy who donated the money for the math building . They 're hoping he 'll give them a science hall too . " " I never heard about her being fired , " I said . " She was given a nice severance package . I negotiated it for her . One year 's salary and a year on leave at half salary . Better than a Guggenheim . " " How much is she asking for the house ? " " However much she can get , to be perfectly frank , which is a lot less than she thinks . It 's October , and who is in the market for a fancy house ? Nobody , that 's who . If you 're interested , I 'll see what I can do for you . " So I went to inspect the seductive lady 's house . A two-story white Greek Revival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back . Excellent condition , newly renovated , said the lady agent who showed me through the place . There was a kitchen with Finnish cabinetry , and a living room with a blue ceramic Swedish fireplace and cherry wainscoting , and an oak staircase , and three upstairs bedrooms replastered and papered , with new oak floors , and two upstairs baths all marble and glass , one with a whirlpool . " It 's a peach , " she said . " Bring your wife to see it . " I said I was n't married . " Well , " she said , " I 'm sure you would be very happy here . " Howard handled the whole deal . " Let me do this , " he said , and he did it . He made an offer somewhat less than half of the asking price , and he withstood the fury of the agent , and he reported back almost daily . To him , it was like war . " There are no other prospective buyers . I know it . They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the college wanting to buy it for faculty housing . No way . The elephant is down , the tigers are circling . " And the next day he called and said , " They have surrendered ! " He whooped over the telephone . He 'd actually gotten the house for less than the original low offer . Something about a zoning variance that the seller had n't disclosed . The agent was livid , but she capitulated . And a month later , I unlocked the back door and walked into the kitchen . It was a truly extraordinary kitchen , part science lab , part lounge . A cooking island and a ceiling rack for pans and two ovens , a stainless-steel refrigerator big enough to hold a hog carcass . In protest , Miss Sanders had left the place filthy and littered with packing materials ; there was an arc of dried coffee on one wall where she had flung it from her cup . But compared to the dismal apartments I 'd lived in , this was a fine home indeed . It cast a kindly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The master bedroom was long , with a ten-foot ceiling . One could imagine delightful things happening there . And then I saw on the master-bathroom mirror , written in foot-high red lipstick letters : THIEF . And underneath , in small letters : " someday someone will do this to you . " Nobody had ever put a curse on me before . Motorists had sworn at me , ex-girlfriends had called me names , but this was a specific curse : " As you did to me , so it shall be done unto you . " I had sicced my gladiator on a defenseless woman and plundered her house , and now what would be a just desert ? Probably something like prostate cancer . What goes around comes around . One morning , I 'd get up and take a leak and the bowl would be bright red with blood , and I 'd go to some specialist in the city and sit in a beige waiting room , listening to soupy music , thinking about my crumbling innards , pleading with God for a miracle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am spending some of my precious last hours on earth learning more about Tammy Wynette . And then proceeding to the examining room . Disrobing . Waiting for the arrival of the prostate potentate himself , Dr. Oh , and his various benedictions and incantations , and then the presentation of the posterior for the digital exam . Yes , it seemed utterly clear to me . Cancer would be a fitting reward for having snookered poor Professor Sanders . I would enjoy a few months of the good life , and then the hand of death would tap me on the shoulder .
