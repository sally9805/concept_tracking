<p> Writer Charles Marowitz no doubt had his tongue in cheek when he applied the title Sherlock 's Last Case to his 1987 Broadway play , which opens Saturday as the second " Summer Chills " series mystery on the Alley Theater 's Large Stage . <p> If the past 110 years are any indication , Sir Arthur Conan Doyle 's immortal and indefatigable sleuth - literature 's most famous detective - will continue to solve baffling crimes for at least another century . <p> Doyle actually tried to kill off his brainy creation in 1893 - but the public outcry was so strong that the author contrived to bring Holmes back to life a few years later . <p> Doyle ( 1859-1930 ) first introduced Holmes to the world in A Study in Scarlet , published in the 1887 Beeton 's Christmas Annual . At the time , Doyle was a doctor ( apparently not a particularly successful one ) , with writing as his sideline . <p> The birth of Holmes changed all that . With his incomparable gift for deductive reasoning , not to mention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Watson , Holmes caught on with the public in a big way . Subsequent cases left the public hungry for more . Within a few years , Doyle gave up his medical practice altogether to concentrate on full-time writing . <p> Still , if Doyle had not pursued his initial path in medicine , the world might not have been introduced to Holmes - at least not as the distinctive character known to millions . The author modeled Holmes on Edinburgh physician Dr. Joseph Bell , a master at extrapolating volumes from " trivial " details . He was one of Doyle 's medical-school teachers . <p> Despite the temporary respite when he " killed " Holmes , Doyle wrote a total of four novels and 56 stories ( four volumes ' worth ) featuring the famous sleuth . Doyle would have liked to be remembered for his historical novels ( such as Sir Nigel and Micah Clarke ) ; he also wrote adventure and science-fiction novels ( The Lost World ) . But that was not to be : Today Doyle is recognized first and foremost as the creator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleuthing to the pages of Doyle 's fiction ( and the imaginations of other authors who have revived the character from time to time ) , Holmes has enjoyed a long history on both stage and screen . <p> Noted turn-of-the-century actor William Gillette received Doyle 's permission to write a play based on the character . Premiered in 1899 , Sherlock Holmes became the biggest success of Gillette 's career - a vehicle he would revive periodically throughout his career . He said his Broadway farewell to the role in 1929 , gave his last tour in 1931-32 , and even did one last radio play as Holmes in 1935 , two years before his death . John Wood revived Gillette 's play on Broadway in 1974 . <p> In the person of Fritz Weaver , Holmes braved the Broadway musical stage in 1965 's Baker Street , with book by Jerome Coopersmith , songs by Marion Grudeff and Raymond Jessel . Baker Street is recalled as one of the earliest musicals directed by stage wizard Harold Prince and for its then unusually high price tag of $ 600,000 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critical admirers and enjoyed a modest vogue , running for 313 performances . ( And how does Holmes sing ? In the brisk patter song mode of My Fair Lady 's Professor Higgins . ) <p> Paxton Whitehead played Holmes in The Crucifer of Blood , Paul Giovanni 's blood-and-thunder thriller of 1978 , distinguished by some smashing sets and stage effects - and an early featured performance by Glenn Close . Crucifer was made into a TV film in 1991 , with Charlton Heston starring as the detective . <p> Broadway matinee idol Frank Langella assumed the deerstalker cap when Sherlock 's Last Case premiered in 1987 . Although it was not a favorite of critics ( Frank Rich wrote a scathing notice in the New York Times ) , Marowitz 's play managed to hang on for 124 performances - proof of the drawing power of Holmes ' name ( and Langella 's ) . With its title promising a Holmesian adventure , the play has had an afterlife in stock ; Main Street Theater presented its Houston premiere in 1989 . <p> However numerous his exploits on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the movies - beginning with American-made , one-reel , silent films as early as 1903 and 1905 . His exploits were just as popular in Europe , with Denmark producing a series of 12 one-reelers in 1908 , and French and German silent shorts in the early 1910s . As silent film expanded , British six-reelers of longer Holmes tales - A Study in Scarlet and The Valley of Fear - were released in 1914 and 1916 . Gillette brought his stage portrayal of Holmes to the silent screen in 1916 . <p> Legendary actor John Barrymore tackled the role , opposite Roland Young 's Watson , in a 1922 Sherlock Holmes , adapted from Gillette 's play . A full-length British film of The Hound of the Baskervilles was released the same year , with Eille Norwood as Holmes . Hound , by the way , has been the most frequently filmed of Holmes ' adventures , with at least seven versions through the years . <p> Clive Brook became the first " talkie " Holmes in 1929 's The Return of Sherlock Holmes . He would reprise the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Watson . Strangely enough , the next year found Owens playing Holmes in A Study in Scarlet . Meanwhile , the renowned Raymond Massey played Holmes in 1931 's The Speckled Band . In the same year , Arthur Wontner ( described as " a perfect Holmes " in The Filmgoer 's Companion ) assumed the role in Sherlock Holmes ' Final Hour and returned to the role in four more films by 1936 . <p> Filmdom 's most famous Holmes arrived on the scene with the 1939 Hollywood remake of The Hound of the Baskervilles ' starring Basil Rathbone as the arrogant , erudite Holmes and Nigel Bruce as a lovably dense Watson . They made such a splash that , before the year was out , they were rushed into The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes , loosely based on Gillette 's play . <p> Ideally cast in their roles , and with an engaging chemistry , Rathbone and Bruce returned in 1941 's Sherlock Holmes and the Voice of Terror , launching a series of a dozen films that would continue through 1946 . The twist was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in modern settings - outwitting Nazi spies and the like . Among the best in the series were The Scarlet Claw , The Pearl of Death and the duo 's run-in with Gale Sondergaard 's sinister Spider Woman . <p> The popular series was considered the last word in Holmes ' cinematic adventures - at least until a British remake of Hound of the Baskervilles , featuring British horror film favorite Peter Cushing as Holmes , ended the drought in 1959 . Christopher Lee , another star associated with horror flick took the role in 1962 's Sherlock Holmes and the Deadly Necklace . John Neville was Holmes in 1965 's A Study in Terror , its clever premise pitting Holmes against the infamous Jack the Ripper . <p> The great director and screenwriter Billy Wilder supplied his understated ironic take on the legendary sleuth and his sidekick in 1969 's The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes , with Robert Stephens as Holmes and Colin Blakely as Watson . In the 1970 film version of James Goldman 's They Might Be Giants , George C. Scott played an eccentric who believed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his mostly misguided 1976 comedy The Adventure of Sherlock Holmes ' Smarter Brother . <p> Famed English stage star Nicol Williamson made an intense Holmes in the 1976 film version of Nicholas Meyer 's The Seven Percent Solution , which had Holmes undergoing psychoanalysis by Sigmund Freud . Christopher Plummer played Holmes to James Mason 's Watson in 1978 's Murder by Decree , another case involving Jack the Ripper . In the early 1980s , the Royal Shakespeare Company 's Ian Richardson played Holmes in well-received TV films of Hound and The Sign of the Four . <p> The actor most strongly associated with the role in recent years was Jeremy Brett , who with David Burke as Watson , starred in a series of hour-long mysteries filmed for British television . The first 13 episodes proved so popular that the series continued for several years , airing in the United States on PBS ' popular Mystery program . Like Gillette and Rathbone before him , Brett became virtually a full-time Holmes in this phase of his career . <p> So even though Sherlock 's Last Case marks the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company mainstays John Feltch and James Black assume their respective roles as Holmes and Watson , they will be continuing a long and honorable tradition . <p> DETAILS : Sherlock 's Last Case will be presented in a preview at 8 p.m .
