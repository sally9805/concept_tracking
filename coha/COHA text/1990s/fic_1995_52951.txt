JAN , I THINK IT 'S GOING to rain . " <p> Jan Van der Hoff looked up to where his wife , Frieda , pointed to a mass of black clouds boiling up in the western sky , blotting out the stars like a great fist rising over the ragged Panamint Mountains . " It wo n't hit here , " Jan said . " We 're on the edge of Death Valley . It rains here about once every twenty years . " <p> He glanced around the camp . He and Frieda sat together on a double size sleeping bag rolled out on the hard ground . A few feet in front of them , a portable stove sputtered , throwing off a flickering light and reeking of kerosene . Beyond that , Jan 's brother Peter sat on an identical bag . His new wife , Sarah , firelight gleaming red in her brown hair , rested her head in his lap . They wore matching red nylon jackets with the designer 's logo written two inches high . <p> Peter was thirty-six , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smart ass . Sarah was thirty-one , not far behind Peter . At forty-two himself , his blond hair thinning to nothing , and a bit of a paunch , Jan had a hard time remembering they were not children . Frieda , with both her outlook and figure molded by her job as an aerobics instructor , had more patience . <p> Lightning flashed . For a split second , the Panamints ' barren sides blazed in gold . Wind whispered down the dry gullies , throwing a blinding cloud of dust into Jan 's eyes . The wind was cool , and smelled of rain . <p> " I think may be this is that twentieth year , " Frieda said . " We 'd better get back to the van pronto . " <p> " What ? Become the only people in history to be rained out of Death Valley ? " Jan laughed . " Not a chance . " <p> " It 's the Curse of the Lost Breyfogle Mine . " Peter made Twilight Zone noises . " Face it , bro , you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for it . I just happen to like camping in the desert . " <p> " Uh huh . " <p> " So what 's this Breyfogle you guys tease Jan about ? " Sarah asked . " You 've been bugging him about it all day . Big family secret ? I 'm one of the family now . So tell me . " <p> " Oh , Lord . Do n't start a historian talking about history . " Frieda put her hands over her ears . Jan winced . Once she 'd have listened to his historical research for hours . But after sixteen years of marriage , what could you expect ? The fact that she was n't putting strychnine in his soda made him way ahead of the average . <p> So he gave Sarah the short version . " I 'm writing a monograph on the lost mine mythology of the Old West . The Lost Breyfogle is the local variation of the Lost Dutchman Mine . " <p> " You mean the one in Arizona ? " she asked . <p> " Actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I 'm sure there 's more . Every Western state has at least one . " <p> " Why is it always Dutchmen ? " Peter asked . " I smell prejudice here . Trying to make us Dutch folks look careless , like we 're always losing our mines . " <p> " I do n't think Jan 's ever lost a mine , but you should see the way he loses socks , " said Frieda . <p> " What about the Lost Breyfogle ? " said Sarah . " Is it a ghost story or something ? " <p> Jan smiled . " Sort of . More like a legend , really , but there are plenty of disappearances and deaths . " <p> " Oh great ! Let 's hear it . " <p> Jan leaned toward the stove 's flickering light . " Well , " he said , " there 's dozens of different stories , but with a few exceptions , they have a lot in common . First , there 's a group going West . Then there 's a fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drives a small party off the beaten trail . With old man Breyfogle , he and a couple of friends wanted to cut across Death Valley . The others did n't . <p> " Anyway , the small group wanders around , totally lost , and finally stumbles onto a rich gold strike . Sometimes it 's nuggets the size of cherries , or ore so rich hunks of gold shine in the sun . The happy miners gather the gold and put it in a coffee can , a blue bucket  --  never black , or white or red , always blue  --  or a Dutch oven . Here , Breyfogle was an exception . He was a giant of a man with huge feet , so he supposedly filled a boot with gold . " <p> " We 're going to get a boot filled with water if we do n't get back to the van , " said Frieda , sniffing the air . " I do n't care if it is Death Valley . It 's going to rain . " <p> Jan , lost in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prominent landmark which marks the mine ; an old abandoned cabin or three tall trees . In Breyfogle 's case , it was a twisted tree with a pool of water . Not much of a landmark anywhere else , but a big deal in Death Valley . " <p> Jan paused , noting that Sarah 's face was rapt , her eyes sparkling in the light from the camp stove . " So now the miners start back to civilization , carrying their gold . They note another landmark , a big one , usually a mountain with twin peaks . Sometimes they make a crude map , but that 's optional . No sooner do they get away from the mine , there 's an Indian attack . They fight like hell , but the Indians kill all but one of them , and knock the survivor unconscious . Dazed , he picks up the gold and wanders around , half out of his head , for a long time . Finally , someone finds him , completely delirious , rambling on about the fabulous gold strike . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hires people to go back with him to find the lost mine . They do find some of the landmarks , but not the mine . That poor Dutchman is doomed , cursed to wander the rest of his life , trying to find his lost gold . He goes mad , and finally disappears into the hills forever . " <p> " Wow , " said Sarah . " So you 're looking for the Breyfogle mine ? " <p> Jan shook his head . " No . Hundreds of people have tried to find it . By now every inch of this desert must have been searched a dozen times . If there were really any gold , they would have found it . " <p> All was silent except the hissing of the stove . Then smart ass Peter had to spoil it . <p> " My impression of a Dutch miner , " he said . He turned his head , speaking with a Dutch accent bad enough to get him hanged in Amsterdam . " Ach , Hans ! Come und look at all dee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Now he turned back . " Hefans . Vo ist dee nize golt mine ? It vas here yoost a second ago . " <p> Sarah giggled . Jan was about to say something when a bucket of water hit him in the face . <p> Or at least that 's what it felt like . Driven by a screaming wind , rain hit so hard it went right through his nylon windbreaker and blue jeans . The camp stove sputtered out . The wind picked up the end of the sleeping bag and tried to roll Jan and Frieda up like hot dogs in a bun . <p> " I told you and told you . . . " Frieda screamed , the wind whipping the words from her mouth . <p> " Hush ! What 's that noise ? " A low rumbling rolled down the canyon . <p> Lightning flashed . In the sudden light , Jan saw a brown moving mass at the head of the ravine . " Flash flood ! Run for your lives . " <p> A long tongue of water rolled through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to carry off the sleeping bags . With Frieda a step in front of him , Jan scrambled up the side of the slope . His shoes kept slipping in the mud , and he felt like a cockroach climbing a wet glass window . <p> Lightning . In its glare , Jan saw that the water running through the camp had become a frothing river , tipping over the camp stove and surging on down the valley . In the distance he saw Sarah climbing madly up the side of the ravine , and Peter running downward toward the mouth of the valley where they had left the van . <p> " Peter ! You 'll never make it ! Get to high ground ! " Jan shouted , but he could n't tell if Peter heard him or not . <p> Climbing felt like one of those nightmares in which you run as fast as you can but never move . Jan shoved his feet and hands deep into the mud , trying to get a solid hold . Each movement sent a miniature mud slide cascading down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sending rivulets of cold water down his arms and legs . In the dark , he could see nothing , not even Frieda , who he hoped was still ahead of him . She taught aerobics . She was lighter and in better shape than Jan . She would be okay . He kept climbing , the slope melting under his hands as if it were made of brown sugar . <p> A muddy hand struck him in the face . " Stop . We 're on the edge of a cliff ! " Frieda shouted , her voice strained over the howling of the wind . <p> Jan put his lips next to her ear . " A cliff ? There 's no cliff . I 've been over this slope lots of times . " <p> Lightning flashed . A few feet ahead , the land abruptly dropped into the night . In the brief instant of light , Jan could n't see the bottom . <p> " I nearly fell over , " Frieda said . <p> " I would have if you had n't stopped me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her a hug . " Have you seen the others ? " <p> " I think Sarah is only a little down this ridge . I do n't know what happened to Peter . " <p> " Neither do I. Let 's go find them . " <p> They walked hand in hand , balancing on a ridge narrower than a city sidewalk . Jan could n't believe it . He knew everything looked different in the dark , but surely he would have noticed this incredible cliff before . <p> When lightning flashed again they saw Sarah on all fours , peering over the edge , her face streaked with mud , tears , and rain . <p> " It 's Peter , " she cried . " He 's fallen in . " <p> Horrified , Jan looked over the edge of the cliff , but in the darkness he could see nothing . Gusts of wind threatened to pick him up and throw him over . <p> " Peter ! " he shouted . <p> " Haay . . . aaayy . . . eeoo . " Jan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " What did he say ? " asked Sarah . <p> " I ca n't make out a word , but at least he 's alive . Let 's see if we can get down there . " <p> " I could , if I had a rope , " said Sarah . <p> There was a rope , a first aid kit , and desert emergency rations back in the van . At the moment , they might as well have been on Jupiter . <p> " Here . Give me your belts , " Sarah said . She 'd already taken hers off . Taking Jan 's and Frieda 's , she fastened them together . " Now , Jan , you and Frieda hold me . I 'm going to lean over the edge and try to see the bottom . " <p> " That 's dangerous . You should let me do it , " said Jan . <p> " No . I 'm lighter than you , and I 've done rock climbing . Frieda , you hang onto Jan and brace him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sarah grasped the other end and leaned out over the edge . <p> " I think I see him , " she yelled when lightning lit up the sky again . " Let me out just a little farther  --  yow ! " <p> Sarah screamed as the mud ridge collapsed under their feet . Jan twisted in mid air , trying to reach more solid ground . Frieda clutched at his clothes as all three plunged over the edge and tumbled down the slope in a mudslide . <p> Near the bottom , a thick clump of bushes broke their fall . Jan landed on top of Sarah , then Frieda landed on top of him , nearly knocking his wind out . He gasped for breath . <p> " Anyone hurt ? " Peter said , standing over them . <p> " I guess not , " Sarah mumbled . " But I remember now why I gave up rock climbing . " <p> " I 'm okay , I guess . Only filthy , " said Frieda . <p> Jan moaned in a positive manner . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's overhung , " said Peter . <p> " We could n't hear you in the storm , " Jan said . <p> " What storm ? It 's been gone since the second I fell into this ravine . " <p> Astonished , Jan looked into the sky . Stars shone bright and clear around a quarter moon . Not a cloud , or a puff of wind , marred the perfect calm . Clumsily , he stood up . <p> Not only had the storm stopped in a split second , the ground was n't wet . And where did all this brush come from ? There was no brush this near Death Valley . It was taller than he was , and so thick the four of them could barely force a way through . <p> When they finally got to a clearing , Peter said , " You've. been here before , Jan . Do you know where we are ? " <p> " I 've never seen this ravine . " In the moonlight Jan could see two sharp peaks prodding the distant sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them before ? He itched for a better look at them . <p> Right now , though , the most important thing was to get warm . The ground here might be dry , but they were still soaked . In a few minutes they gathered enough dry grass to make a pad , and lay on the ground , huddled together like kittens in the cold . <p> As Jan began to grow warmer , the situation felt less desperate . They could not possibly have traveled more than a couple of miles from camp . Come morning they could climb out of this ravine and probably see the van in plain sight . <p> Lying on his back with Frieda breathing softly in his ear , Jan looked into the sky . As a boy scout , he had learned the major constellations , but now he did n't recognize anything . Well , anything but the famous Southern Cross , which could n't possibly be , because it never appeared in the Northern Hemisphere . <p> Something weird was going on here . He wished he had his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mud . He had to record this somehow , though . Nobody would believe him otherwise . <p> Careful not to wake Frieda , he eased the notebook and pen he always carried with him out of his shirt pocket . On a blank page he drew the constellations as accurately as he could , including the horizon for reference . He checked the time and wrote that down as well , then tucked the notebook back into his pocket . When he got back to civilization he would try to figure out what it all meant , but he saw no need to cause a panic now . <p> He decided he 'd better not mention seeing the Southern Cross even in the morning . <p> Morning dawned foggy and cool . Not your typical Death Valley weather , Jan thought . During the night , he had convinced himself he had been dreaming about the Southern Cross , the vanishing storm , and the shifting mountains . Well , now that day had come , at least the Southern Cross was gone . <p> On the other hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoped . A rocky cliff barred the way down the ravine , so they could walk in only one direction : up . Sarah , bless her , fished two crumbled candy bars from her jacket pocket , so they each had a handful of chocolate crumbs . <p> By noon , they were intently looking for water and finding none . It could be worse , thought Jan . At least the weather was cool , totally unlike the usual furnace heat of Death Valley . <p> Walking ahead , Sarah and Peter rounded a bend , then shouted , " Water here ! A house ! Come on , you guys ! " <p> Jan and Frieda broke into a run and rounded the comer . <p> The ravine widened into a meadow . At the upper end , by a twisted tree , sunlight glittered off a pool of water . Sarah and Peter knelt by it , drinking noisily . A few feet away , nearly smothered by brush , an old log cabin moldered into the ground . Part of the roof had collapsed , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pond . Perhaps fifty yards away , three tall trees swayed in the slight breeze . On the horizon , the twin peaks Jan had seen last night loomed over the valley . <p> Jan felt an electric thrill pass down his spine . Full of dread , he knelt beside Peter and looked into the clear pool . <p> The mud at the bottom gleamed with bits of gold . <p> " Hey . What 's this shiny stuff ? " Peter said . <p> " Fool 's gold , " Jan said quickly . " Iron pyrites . Pretty , but worthless . Do n't pick it up . " <p> Peter plunged his hand into the water and came up with a nugget the size of a cherry . " Fool 's gold my ass . Feel how heavy it is . Got to be the real thing . " He handed the nugget to Jan , who took it reluctantly , as if it might bum his hand . It was astonishingly heavy , and the dull yellow color was right . He dinted one side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun . <p> " It 's gold , all right , " he said at last . <p> " Here 's more , " said Sarah . " Lots more . " <p> Peter threw his head back and howled like a wolf . In seconds , he and Sarah had stripped to their underwear and were splashing about , frisky as young otters . Soon they had a little pile of nuggets . Jan and Frieda watched in stunned silence . <p> " Hey , why so glum , bro ? " Peter said as he and Sarah at last wore down enough to rest . " You scared of the Curse of the Lost Breyfogle ? " <p> " Well . I think . . . Hell , yes . I feel like I 've walked into one of my own lectures . This ca n't be real . " <p> Peter laughed . " So what 's that ? " he said , pointing to the gold . " A myth ? " <p> " We need something to put it in , " said Sarah , getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the doorway . " Hey . Here 's something . " She ran back , carrying a wooden bucket wrapped with rusty iron bands . <p> A blue bucket . <p> Jan stood up . " That does it . This ca n't be happening . C'm on . I think we should leave this gold and get the hell out of here . Everything so far fits the story exactly . If it runs true , all but one of us will be killed , and the last one will spend his life searching for the mine . I want no part of that . " <p> Peter ignored him and scooped the gold nuggets into the bucket . <p> " Jan has a point , " said Frieda . She pointed to the twin peaks . " Those mountains were n't there yesterday . It 's like we stepped off the end of the world , right into Jan 's legend . Let 's leave the gold , break out of the story , and go home . If we can . " <p> " You crazy ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to be scared off by a bunch of old stories , no wonder Dutchmen lose their mines . You scared of an Indian attack ? " He lifted the bucket . " Man , feel that weight . I do n't know exactly what gold 's going for now , but we must have over a hundred thousand bucks . Not bad for ten minutes skinny dipping . " <p> Jan crossed his arms . " If we accept it , we 're buying into the myth . Throw it out . " <p> " No way . Sarah and I are keeping our share . We 'll keep it all , if you guys do n't want any . We gathered it . " <p> Sarah , pulling on her pants , nodded her head . " You do n't take your share , it just makes more for us . " <p> " Aw , look , " Peter continued . " All last year you moaned and bitched because you did n't get that piddling state research grant . Now , how much was that ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold drew his eyes as if by gravitational attraction . <p> " Okay . This bucket 's got ten times that much for you . And as much more for Frieda . God knows how much we could get if we had proper equipment . " <p> " It would be nice if you could have your sabbatical , " Frieda mumbled , as if to herself . " I could use a break , too . " <p> " Fifty thousand could make a hell of a second honeymoon , " Peter said . <p> Jan realized he did n't have what it took to throw away that much money , not just for an old myth . " Okay , " he said at last , " but one thing : I do n't plan on becoming the next Breyfogle . We 're going to mark this mine so we 'll know for sure where it is . I propose we build a cairn every hundred yards or so , so we ca n't possibly miss our way back . " <p> " Yes , but let 's get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two now , and we may have a way to go . " <p> They started walking , with Peter and Sarah ahead . Finally the walls of the ravine dropped off , and they began climbing to the top . <p> All the way along , Peter hummed to himself , danced , bounced around , and in general exuded energy . <p> " Why so glum , big bro ? Do n't you like being rich ? " he asked Jan while they piled stones for another cairn . <p> " It 's the story . I ca n't get it out of my mind that we 're courting disaster by taking the gold . " But when they finished the cairn , Jan took his turn carrying the bucket . <p> They had just about reached the ridgetop when Jan heard an arrow whistle past his face . A gunshot blasted , and a bullet whanged by his head so close he felt the wind . Immediately ahead , dozens of Indians leaped up from ambush . They had greasy black hair , painted faces , broad-bottomed pants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a blunderbuss . <p> " My god ! Run for it ! " shouted Peter . He turned to flee , but three arrows slammed into his back . With a look of intense surprise , he pitched face forward to the ground . <p> " Peter ! " Sarah knelt by Peter 's body . The blunderbuss boomed , sending a cloud of black smoke into the air . Sarah fell on top of him . <p> " Behind you , Jan ! " Frieda screamed . Jan turned to see Indians surrounding them . One grabbed Frieda , twisting her arm . <p> Jan stepped toward her , swinging the bucket of gold in a long are with all his weight behind it . It caught the Indian on the back of the neck . He sighed like a deflating tire , dropped to his knees , then to the ground . <p> His black hair stuck to the bucket . <p> Jan gagged . He 'd scalped an Indian ! But no , the hair was a wig . Jan swung the bucket again , forcing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For a second , Jan and the Indians stared at each other . They seemed reluctant to close in . <p> The Indians were all wrong , like the ones in cheap Westerns . Most wore wigs . Their face paint looked as if it had been applied by amateurs in the dark . Jan had seen more authentic Native Americans in grade school Thanksgiving pageants . <p> A massive man with a full beard wobbled up , the other Indians giving him plenty of room . He had a wooden peg leg which sank several inches into the ground with each step , making him careen like a drunk . He bellowed a command , an unintelligible phrase that sounded like " Dee vrou wen . " <p> The voice reminded Jan of Great Grandpa Van der Hoff , who had never learned English . " Vrouw " was Dutch for woman . <p> As if shocked to life by the bellowing voice , the phony Indians attacked . One grabbed Frieda . Jan swung the bucket like a mace , but another one grabbed it , jerking Jan 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peg-legged one slapped Frieda , bringing blood to her lips . Jan jumped him , driving his fist into the man 's stomach . <p> It bounced off . Astonished , Jan struck again . Nothing . It was like hitting a sand bag . The man made a slight gesture with one hand and instantly an unseen force slammed Jan to the ground . The force held him pinned like an insect while an Indian drew his bow , pointing the arrow directly at Jan 's chest . <p> " No ! Do n't kill him ! " Frieda twisted herself loose and lunged in front of Jan just as the bow twanged . The arrow slashed through her body , jutting out in back like a bloody finger . She fell at his feet . <p> " God , no , Frieda ! " Jan struggled violently against the massive weight pressing him into the ground . Exerting every bit of strength , he forced himself up to his knees . <p> Then a blow from behind sent him reeling down into darkness . <p> The sun was low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought there were two suns , and that Heaven  --  or was it Hell ?  --  must be in orbit around a double star , but gradually the two images coalesced and he saw a single sun above a sparsely forested hillside . He was leaning against a tree , and his head hurt like fury . Cautiously , he raised his hand and felt for a wound , but met with cloth instead . Exploring with his fingers , he discovered a T-shirt around his head , tied in place with string . <p> Frieda ? Had she bandaged him after some kind of a fall ? Then the memory he 'd been struggling to hold at bay burst into clarity : Frieda leaping in front of the Indian 's arrow just as he fired  --  and falling dead at his feet . <p> Sitting up , he looked frantically for his wife , praying he would find her still alive . He did n't see her body , nor Peter 's , nor Sarah 's . <p> The blue bucket of gold lay in plain sight , though , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground . <p> Afraid that he might call the Indians back , but more afraid that his companions might have crawled off and might even now be gasping their last breaths , he called out , wincing with the pain it brought to his head . But no one responded . <p> He forced himself to stand and search farther , but with no better results . He saw plenty of evidence of the attack  --  boot tracks in the dirt and splashes of blood on rocks  --  but no bodies . He should have found at least Peter 's . Peter had taken three arrows square in the back . <p> Besides , why , if any of them had survived , would they have bandaged Jan 's head and then abandoned him ? That made no sense . <p> Of course , being attacked by Dutch-speaking Indians did n't exactly make sense , either , but leaving him did n't seem like something Frieda and Peter and Sarah would do . So more likely the Indians had taken them , or their bodies , for purposes unknown . Jan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't pathfinder enough to follow any in the general confusion . <p> The only evidence that they 'd ever been there was the scattered gold . Knowing he was taking the next step in the same damned legend , but not knowing what else to do , he scooped the loose nuggets back into the bucket . <p> He looked around , trying to get his bearings . There were two prominent peaks to the east , one with an unmistakable cliff on the north face . Below them lay the valley with the cabin and the three tall trees and the pool full of gold . <p> Determined not to make Breyfogle 's mistake , he took his notebook out of his pocket , flipped to the empty page behind the drawing he 'd made of the night sky , and sketched the landmarks that he could see from where he stood . Then , putting his notebook away , he gathered up rocks and stacked them into a hip-high cairn . <p> When that was done he took a last , mournful look at the place where his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long hike back to civilization . <p> It was getting dark when he found the van , still right where they 'd left it , parked too high on the ridge to be touched by the flood . Jan unlocked the door and lunged for the cooler in back , pouring half a bottle of now-hot water down his throat in one huge gulp , then pouring the other half over his head , which throbbed with every heartbeat . Not caring about the blood and water stains he was putting on the upholstery , he started the engine and drove down the dirt road toward the main highway . <p> He was halfway to Ridgecrest  --  the only town of any size between Death Valley and Bakersfield  --  when it occurred to him that he was n't going to tell the police about the Indians . Or the gold . If he told them about the Indians , they 'd think he was crazy , and if he told them about the gold they 'd think he killed the others to keep it all for himself . No , far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  on the flash flood . <p> He had his story fixed in his mind by the time he walked into the hospital emergency room . He practiced it on the nurse behind the desk , who interrupted him constantly for information about insurance , medical history , and for his signature on half a dozen legal forms before she took him to an examination room , where the doctor asked him about it again while he unwound the T-shirt from Jan 's head and examined his wound . <p> " Hey , you must be a scout master , " the doctor said when he cut off the string holding the shirt in place . " I have n't seen a bowline knot in years . " <p> Jan realized the doctor thought he 'd bandaged his own wound . He saw no reason to tell him otherwise . " I was n't paying much attention to the knot , " he said . " I was just trying to get the damned bleeding stopped .

A little deeper and you 'd be playing harp in the choir invisible . " <p> A policewoman arrived just as the doctor finished stitching him up , and Jan went through his story a third time for her . She asked him a few questions about the storm and how he 'd managed to escape the flash flood when the others had n't , but she did n't seem particularly interested . Jan realized these people were so used to hikers getting lost in the desert and dying of exposure that they could n't get worked up over three more killed in a simple flash flood . The news of the gold mine and the fake Indians might get their attention , but he 'd already committed himself to the other story . Switching it now would only land him in trouble . <p> Jan felt grim satisfaction in knowing that he 'd broken out of the legend . It always included the survivors telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he needed help searching for Frieda and Peter and Sarah .

" <p> She did n't look happy . " We 'd love to help you , mister , but that flood could 've carried them for miles . It could take days to find ' era unless we do it by air , but with our budget we ca n't fly unless it 's a national emergency .

And I was in that valley ; I know it 's there . Besides that , I made rock cairns all the way out to the main trail , so all we 've got to do is follow them . " <p> The pilot laughed , and the cop laughed with him . <p> " What 's funny ? " Jan asked . <p> " Mister , " the pilot said , " there 's been prospectors making cairns in them mountains for over a hun'erd years . You 'd be better off pushing everybody else 's over and following the path what ai n't got any than building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> The cop patted him on the back . " It does n't matter , " she said . " From the air it is n't hard to find evidence of a flood . " <p> She was right ; within minutes of reaching the Panamint range , they found it . But the canyon Jan had hiked out of yesterday was not on either side of it . They found no forest , no cabin , no twin peaks . . . and no sign of Frieda , Peter , or Sarah . <p> Until then , Jan had not believed he 'd been caught in a legend . He 'd assumed there was some logical explanation behind everything but from the helicopter he could see the entire Panamint range , and the valley was simply not there . <p> All the same , he could n't give up without trying everything , so he drove back in the van and tried to follow his cairns , but the helicopter pilot had been right . He was able to follow them for a mile or so , but then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which were his , and beyond that the terrain suddenly began to look unfamiliar as well . It was as if the canyon he 'd been in had been physically removed and a different one put in its place . <p> Where did it go , then ? he wondered on the long hike back to the van . Had he hallucinated the whole thing ? Impossible . He 'd felt the rocks , drank the water . He still had the gold . <p> And the star map . When he 'd drawn it , he 'd thought it could help them locate themselves ; maybe it would . But for that he needed the help of an astronomer . <p> As the sun slowly set , Jan hiked back to the van and drove home to Los Angeles . <p> Dennis Bigelow was the only astronomer Jan knew , and him only because they 'd met for a few minutes at a faculty Christmas party . He was a tall , gangly man with enormous glasses , which he pulled off when he saw Jan waiting for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Van der Hoff ? " he asked , squinting . <p> " In person , " said Jan . <p> " What happened to your head ? " <p> " An Indian beaned me with a tomahawk . And he took off with my wife 's body . I need your help catching him . " <p> " Me ? " Blinking Dennis unlocked his office door and ushered Jan inside . He had fewer books on his desk than Jan , but more printouts . He dropped another few inches of them on the pile beside his computer and sat down on the only exposed comer of his desk . " How can I. . . body did you say ? Your wife is dead ? " <p> " It 's a long story . " Jan pulled his notebook from his shirt pocket and flipped it to the right page . " Basically , we were kidnapped and taken somewhere we did n't recognize , but I was able to draw this picture of the night sky before I got . . . put back . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " From a hand-drawn map ? " Dennis shook his head . " I could maybe tell you which continent you were on , but I assume you know that much . " <p> " No , I do n't , actually . " Jan held out the map . " I think that 's the Southern Cross , but beyond that I ca n't even guess . " <p> Dennis took the notebook from him . " What 's this stain all over it ? " he asked . <p> " Blood . My blood . " <p> " Oh . " Holding it by his fingertips , Dennis examined the drawing . " Hmm , you drew in the horizon , that 's good . I can probably give you the latitude within a few degrees , then . If you knew the exact time when you drew this , I could even give you the longitude . Only accurate to within the limits of your observation , you know , but it 's surprising how precise the unaided eye can be on angles . Did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I did , " Jan said with pride . " And that scribble there under the blood stain says 10:53 P.M. " <p> Dennis slowly shook his head . " You know , ever since those Indiana Jones movies , I 've had to rethink my attitude toward you history guys . You really get into your work , do n't you ? " <p> Jan shrugged in self-depreciation . " This really did n't have much to do with work . We were just camping out . " <p> " Of course . " Dennis leaned over and switched on his computer . <p> A few minutes later , after loading a star map program and playing with the view until he approximated Jan 's map on the screen , Dennis leaned back in his chair and said , " There you go . You were thirty-five degrees south latitude , and about seventy degrees west longitude . That puts you . . . " He pulled an atlas out of the bookcase next to his computer and flipped through the maps . " . . . hmm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ About on the ' N ' in ' Andes . ' " He held out the map for Jan to see . <p> Jan sat down on the comer of the desk Dennis had vacated . " Chile ? How 'd we get clear down there ? " <p> Dennis shrugged . " That much I ca n't tell you . " <p> Jan could n't believe he had been transported to Chile and back by supernatural means , but an hour in the library poring through the map section added another argument to the theory . There in the foothills of the Andes , about a hundred miles south of Santiago , was a canyon the same shape as the one he 'd drawn , complete with a likely looking double peak to the east of it . <p> All he needed was a good explanation of how a flash flood in Death Valley could send four people to South America , and how he 'd gotten back while the others had n't . Everything he could think of sounded equally illogical : time travelers , UFO aliens , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had gone crazy and murdered Frieda and Peter and Sarah himself , then invented the whole bizarre story afterward to rationalize their murders , but that made even less sense . In that case , where had the bucket of gold come from ? <p> Ghosts ? The four of them had obviously been caught up in an old legend ; maybe they had run afoul of some old-timer 's ghost up there in the mountains , and it had set them up to follow in his footsteps . <p> Whatever the reason , Jan felt sure the only answer he was likely to get waited for him in Chile , not in California . <p> Flying to Santiago turned out to be no more difficult than flying to a major city in the states . It was more trouble to charter a helicopter , but Jan soon discovered that enough American cash could accomplish practically anything . He 'd sold some of the gold before he 'd left , so he was n't sweating the price . Within two hours he was once again in the air , this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wind swirled around him the whole way ; that and the engine 's roar made conversation with the pilot impossible , but they did n't need to talk anyway . Jan clutched a topo map in his hands and pointed out the way , and the pilot flew where he pointed . <p> At last the twin peaks swam toward them from the horizon , and the valley below them took on shape . Jan 's heart beat faster and faster as more and more landmarks checked out . There was the bend with the meadow and the pool of water , and beside it was the cabin . And in front of the cabin , working with picks and shovels , were three people ! For a moment Jan felt sure it was Frieda and Peter and Sarah , but when the helicopter drew closer he realized all three were men . Heavily bearded , ragged-clothed men . <p> " Set it down by that cabin ! " he shouted to the pilot , pointing . The pilot nodded and swooped the ' copter around in a turning dive that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scare them off , you idiot ! " Jan shouted , but it was too late . Two of them ran straight up the sides of the valley , while the third made a running dive right for the middle of the pool . <p> Jan leaped out of the ' copter as soon as it touched down and ran toward the man in the water . The miner was just struggling out to join his companions in their flight when Jan caught up with him and grabbed him by a loose shirt tail . <p> The man screamed as if he 'd been shot , then fell to his knees and bowed his head . <p> " Jeez , get a grip , " Jan said . " I just want to talk to you . " <p> The man babbled something that sounded like " Vader mivergif ! " It took Jan a moment to realize he 'd spoken Dutch . He 'd said , " Father , forgive me . " <p> Jan replied in kind , saying , " I 'm sorry we scared you . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Talk ? " the man asked . " You are n't taking me to Hell ? " <p> " What ? Of course not . " Jan snorted at the idea , then curiosity made him ask , " Why ? Do you think you deserve it ? " <p> The man turned his head to see his tormentor , then gasped . " You of all people have to ask ? " <p> " What , you know me ? " asked Jan , but then the miner 's face registered . It had been obscured with streaks of war paint when he 'd last seen it , but Jan was sure that this was the same " Indian " who 'd shot an arrow through Frieda 's heart . <p> " On second thought , " he said as he grabbed a handful of the man 's collar and pulled him to his feet , " Maybe I will send you off to Hell . But not until I get some answers . Start talking . " <p> The helicopter 's engine wound down to an idle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitch . The man looked nervously around , no doubt hoping for help from his friends , but the other two were halfway up the ridge by now and still receding . The helicopter pilot waited in his seat , an enormous pistol held casually in his lap , but he made no threatening moves with it . Jan figured he would probably only interfere to protect his ' copter . <p> " I said , start talking , " Jan ordered . " Why did you attack us , and what did you do with my wife 's body ? " <p> Trembling like a leaf in the wind , the man stammered , " I  --  we  --  it was  --  it was the price of our freedom ! Vandervecken made us do it . " <p> " Freedom ? Vandervecken ? What are you talking about ? " <p> The man swallowed . " Vandervecken is a ship 's captain . He swore a blasphemous oath , and was cursed to sail the seas for eternity . He  --  " <p> Jan jerked the man 's collar . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do . What does  --  " <p> " Hah ! I was bosun on the Flying Dutchman for over a hundred years . " As if remembering his pride for the first time , the man shook off Jan 's hand . <p> Jan considered grabbing him again , but the glint in his eyes decided him against it . He said , " Hundred years my ass . You 're not a day over sixty . " <p> The man shook his head . " Forty-eight I am , and was when Vandevercken captured me in 1852 . I 've sailed with him ever since , frozen in time even as it passed me by . " <p> Jan pressed his hands to the sides of his head , as if he could physically force his mind to make sense of the man 's speech . When no answers came , he asked the question foremost in his mind : " What does Vandervecken have to do with my wife ? " <p> But he already suspected the answer . Somehow he 'd gotten caught up in not one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspicion . " She was the price of my release . " Hastily , he added , " not her in particular , but just another person . None of the crew can leave the ship without Vandervecken 's permission , and the price he requires of us is a suitable replacement . But suitable he means somebody we can snatch without too much fuss , and who 's able-bodied and Dutch . He wants no foreigners on his ship . But he wanted even more from me . He required a woman who might come to love him , and thus end his curse . " <p> Jan remembered Wagner 's opera about the Flying Dutchman , how Vandervecken had supposedly been cursed to sail the seas until he found a woman who would be " true unto death . " <p> " Then Peter and Sarah were their replacements ? " he asked , nodding toward the two other miners , who had paused in their flight now that it looked as if Jan was n't going to whisk their companion straight to Hell after all . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 're what we call ' impressed labor . ' We were trying for you instead of the other woman , but she got herself killed in the fight so we did n't have much choice . We had to leave one of you alive . " <p> " What kind of animals are you ? " Jan asked , horrified . " Trading a total stranger 's life for your own . It 's  --  " <p> " When you 've spent a century on the Dutchman and passed up the opportunity to get away , maybe I 'll listen to your little speech , but until then , do n't start getting all indignant on me . " <p> Jan 's bluster died as quickly as it had come . A century at sea ? He already knew what he 'd do . " Why did n't you just snatch them while they were sleeping , then ? " he asked . " Why such an elaborate plan ? Why the gold , and the Indian raid ? And how did you know we were Dutch in the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told us you were the ones . He 's got . . . powers . The gold was payment for their service ; Naval law demands it when you impress a man to sea duty . The Indian disguise was supposed to help you explain it away to your people . We did n't want you in prison ; we wanted you out telling others about the lost mine and getting more Dutchmen out hunting for it . There 's others on the ship who 're itching to leave , too . " <p> Jan did n't know how much of the man 's story he could believe , but it did fit remarkably well with historical facts . Except . . . " Indians are out of date . You 'd have done better to impersonate bikers . " <p> The man shrugged again . " Maybe your missus can set ' em straight before the next raid . " <p> " Frieda 's alive , then ? " Jan asked , hardly able to believe it possible , but willing to grasp at any hope . <p> " Aye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can call time on the Dutchman life . " <p> " How can I get her back ? " <p> " You ca n't . Unless you want to replace her , like she did me . I told you , Vandervecken wo n't let anyone jump ship . " <p> " We 'll see about that . Conjure him up for me . I want to have a word with him . " <p> The man laughed . " Oh you do , do yet I 'll reckon your tone 'd change if I did , but we 're cut off now , no more able to reach him again than you are . Which is why we 're here grubbing in this damned played out mine ; we 've got to find us a way to earn a living in this newfangled world of yours , ' cause we 're on our own now . " <p> " There must be a way of finding him , " Jan insisted . <p> " Oh , aye , there 's ways . Go get yourself lost at sea . Vandervecken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specially lost Dutchmen . If your luck 's with you , he 'll come to wave at you as you drown . " <p> " And if my luck is n't with me ? " <p> " Then you drown on your own , I guess . " <p> Jan looked in the man 's eyes , but saw no hint of duplicity there . Jan could hardly believe his story , but he did n't know if he had much choice . He had no other leads to follow . <p> " All right , " he said at last . " We 'll try to catch up with Vandervecken on the high seas . " <p> " Not ' we , " ' the man said , his nostrils flaring in sudden panic . " I ai n't going with you . " <p> " I say you are , " Jan said . " You took my wife ; you 'll help me get her back . " He reached out to grab the man 's collar again , but this time he fought back ; he shoved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stomach . Jan staggered backward a step , recovered his balance , and lunged forward again , but checked himself when he saw the glint of a knife . <p> " I 'd sooner go to Hell than back on that cursed ship , " the man said . " And I 'll take you there with me if you press it . " <p> Jan turned his head to look toward the helicopter . The pilot held his gun a bit more readily now , but it was clear he was n't going to interfere in Jan 's dispute . Jan looked up the ridge and saw the other two sailors climbing back down . They no doubt would interfere , but not to Jan 's advantage . <p> " At least tell me , " he said , backing off and lowering his arms , " where will I most likely find him ? " <p> The man kept his knife poised for action , but he said , " You 've got courage , I 'll grant you that . Well then , I 'd look for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get into the Pacific Ocean , but he can never make it . That 's part of the curse . The ship 's always in a storm , you see , and always gets blown back . He tries the Cape of Good Hope for a few years , and the Northwest Passage once in a while , and the Horn when he ai n't trying the others . My guess is he 'll keep at the Horn a while longer , now that he 's got fresh crew and it 's right close for him to challenge again . " <p> Jan nodded . " Cape Horn , eh ? Anything else I should know ? " <p> " Well , you 're supposed to keep a bible on board and nail a horseshoe to the foremast to keep him away , so do n't go carrying either of those with you . And if Vandervecken gives you any letters to mail , nail those to the mast , too , or you 'll never make it home . " <p> " If I catch the son of a bitch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Jan . <p> The man laughed . " I do n't think you 'll find that as easy as you think . Mortals ca n't touch him unless he wants ' em to . But all the same , I wish you luck . " <p> " Thanks , I guess , " Jan said , turning away and walking back to the helicopter . " Take me back to the airport , " he told the pilot as he climbed into the passenger seat . " And put that damned pistol away . " <p> Three days into his voyage , Jan began to wonder if he was on a fool 's errand . The Tierra Del Fuegan who had sold him his boat had certainly thought so . The only thing Jan had attracted so far had been an albatross , an enormous white bird that followed him everywhere he went , sometimes perching on the top of the mast but usually keeping station just off the port bow . Albatrosses were omens of good luck , if Coleridge could be believed , but Jan did n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing away , but it would n't leave , and he was n't about to shoot it . Coleridgeis Ancient Mariner had tried that and had been cursed to drift , alone and becalmed and dying of thirst , on the endless sea . <p> Even the thought must have had some effect , for on the afternoon of day three , on an uncharacteristically calm sea on the Atlantic side of the Cape , Jan could n't get the engine to start . He 'd been using the sail as much as possible , both to conserve gas and in the hope that the older technology would somehow bring him closer to the Flying Dutchman , but now he was still miles from the Cape and in this feeble wind it would take most of the day just to make the passage . <p> He 'd just about worn out the battery , but the engine kept firing , leading him on with the promise that on the next try it would catch for certain . Jan resisted the urge to hold his thumb on the starter button until the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choke and letting the intake manifold air out before trying it again . The starter spun slowly , and the engine coughed once , then died . <p> " Damn you ! " Jan swore . " Start , you son of a bitch , or I 'll take you apart bolt by bolt and feed you to the sharks . " He mashed down the start button again , and the engine coughed once more , then backfired loudly . <p> " Arrgh ! " Jan growled , yanking back on the throttle . " I 'll start you , you Godforsaken pile of pistons , if it 's the last thing I  --  " <p> The boat pitched in a sudden swell , nearly throwing Jan from his pilot 's chair . " What the hell ? " he asked , grabbing the handrail for support . The sea had been calm as a bathtub a moment ago . He looked out to starboard ; nothing there . Nothing to port , either . But when he turned aft , his hair tried to stand on end . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than a hundred yards off and closing fast , came a glowing four-master , its sails in tatters , its figurehead etched by wind and waves until it resembled a skeleton more than the woman it had once been . <p> Another wave reached out from the ghost ship and rolled Jan 's boat . He could see the horizon through the hull , and if he squinted he could see flickering shapes on deck and in the rigging , but there was no hope of recognizing Frieda or Peter or Sarah among them . <p> It was the Flying Dutchman . Jan was certain of it . What had brought it now he could n't guess , until he remembered the angry words directed at the engine . He shivered anew . He 'd been that close to making the same mistake Vandervecken had made . <p> Jan had never imagined how careful a person had to be about legends and blasphemous oaths and the like . <p> Now , faced with the real possibility of eternal damnation on board a phantom ship , his resolve nearly died . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could he accomplish by joining them save compounding their torment ? Most likely Vandervecken would simply add Jan to his crew as well . Jan would be better off going back to Los Angeles and trying to contact Frieda through some kind of spiritualist or a Ouija board . <p> Even as he thought it , he knew he could never live with himself if he did that . Frieda had taken an arrow through the heart to save him from death ; could he do any less for her ? <p> The ship drew alongside his boat , still pitching and rolling in its own personal storm . Jan reached out and snagged one of the trailing lines as it swept past , tugging on it to draw himself still closer . It felt like pulling on a thick strand of spaghetti  --  cold and clammy and stretchy , as if it were n't quite substantial  --  but the gap between the two vessels narrowed until he could jump across with a line of his own to the netting hanging from the side of the Dutchman and tie them together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Jan might as well have been clinging to cobwebs . The ship continued to buck in heavy seas , and now Jan felt the storm as well , but when it pitched upward his hands would slip through the ropes as if they were hardly more than smoke , and he would drop downward a foot or more before he could catch another piece of the net and check his fall . <p> He heard ghostly voices shrieking at him from above , and cold chills swirled around him , but neither the ship nor its crew would grow substantial enough for him to grasp or even to hear or see clearly . Something still kept him from crossing over into their world . <p> His boat banged against his legs , and he kicked it away . The net seemed to grow firmer in his hands as he did , but only until the next wave came to shake him loose . What was the problem ? Why could n't he get on board ? <p> His boat drew closer , and he slipped through another rung of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water now . He considered jumping back and trying again , higher up on the net , but when he tugged on the connecting rope the ghost ship grew fainter still and he lurched downward another notch . <p> It was the boat . His last link with the real world kept him from completely joining the spirit world . That had to be it . Without letting himself hesitate , Jan untied the rope and flung it away from him , casting his boat free . <p> At once the wailing from overhead became the cry of dozens of voices . The net in his hand became solid and gritty with salt . Sudden wind whipped his hair into his eyes , and when he reached up to sweep it aside , a wave slammed him into the side of the barnacle-encrusted ship . <p> A shock of pain shot through his head , exactly where he 'd been injured before . The barnacles slashed at his clothes , ripping his coat and scraping his shoulder . Wind howled about his ears . At least now the ropes felt solid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painfully up the ship 's wooden sides . <p> A bearded face looked over the ship 's rail , staring down at him . " Help me , " Jan cried , using his last strength to pull himself above the water level . " Help me , please . " <p> " You do n't know , Amerikaner , " the man said . " Far bedder you drown now dan come aboard dis ship . " <p> Rage flowed through Jan 's veins . Would that idiot let him drown ? His anger gave him new strength . Clumsily , he climbed up over the rounded hull and crawled through the railing , finally throwing himself gasping full length on deck . The ship plunged in the storm , moving so abruptly Jan felt in danger of being bucked off . Wind howled through the rigging . Yet whenever the deck fell , Jan could see the boat he had bought in perfect calm , bobbing along gently as a toy boat in a puddle , albatross gliding overhead . <p> " Jan ! Jan ! Are you okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face looked strained ; his normally clean-shaven cheeks were black with stubble , and his filthy clothes reeked with sweat . Jan had never seen anything so beautiful . <p> " Peter . " He rose up and hugged his brother . " I found you . " Even as he spoke , the wind whipped the words from his mouth . <p> Peter did n't smile . " God , I 'm glad to see you , Jan , but I wish you had n't come here . That sailor was n't being cruel ; he was giving good advice . Now that you 're on the deck , you wo n't get another chance . " <p> " There 's always another chance . Where are Frieda and Sarah ? " <p> " They 're below . Captain Vandervecken 's below with them . " <p> " Let 's go get them . " Jan struggled to his feet . <p> Peter grabbed him by the belt . " Not a good idea . You do n't know this guy . " <p> Jan glanced at the sailors who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crew behind us . . . " <p> " Ha . If the crew could do anything , they 'd have hung Vandervecken from the yardarm and sailed this tub back to Amsterdam 400 years ago . The guy 's not human . " <p> Jan remembered the force which had pushed him to the ground during the attack of the phony Indians . " You might be right . But there has to be something we can do . Even a ghost must have weaknesses . I mean , look at this ship . " The deck 's planks were shrunken and splintered , the sails threadbare , the rigging so worn the ropes looked furry . <p> " Do n't let appearances deceive you , " Peter said . " The curse will keep this thing afloat forever , and Vandervecken will be its captain no matter what we do . " Moodily , he stared off into the sky . " You were right , incidentally . Taking that damned gold signed us up for a term of seven times seven years . Then God knows how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you . " <p> Jan patted his back . " No matter . He 'd have just taken you anyway . " <p> " No . He ca n't . His magic does n't work that way . He has to follow the rules to the letter . He has to pay wages in gold . You must accept before he can take you . Only good thing about this ship ; Vandervecken 's as much a prisoner as any of us . " <p> Jan shook his head . " That 's his problem , not ours . We have to rescue Frieda and Sarah and get the hell off this nightmare . " <p> " Get off the Flying Dutchman ? " a man laughed . Jan turned . The man stood an easy six feet four and had the biggest feet Jan had ever seen unconnected to an elephant . " You hardly came on . Do n't worry . They say the first hundred years is a snap . " He grinned . " Of course the next few hundred get tedious . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Let me introduce you . Jan Vander Hoff , meet Charles Breyfogle , late of the Lost Breyfogle mine . " <p> " Ah , the historian . Your brother has told me so much about you , " Breyfogle said . <p> Jan gaped . Before he could respond , a high-pitched squealing music and a drum beat joined the perpetual howl of the wind . <p> " All hands fall out for wedding drill , " shouted a huge , thick-necked man . Behind him , another man blew on a whistle , and a boy pounded on a drum . " Captain Vandervecken 's orders . All hands on deck for the wedding . " <p> " A wedding ? " Peter said . <p> " You ai n't heard ? Vandervecken is going to make at least one of the women marry him . Maybe both , " Breyfogle said . <p> Peter gave a sort of choking roar , and turned . Breyfogle grabbed him , holding him as easily as a boy might hold a kitten . " Calm down , Peter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He whipped you ? " Jan asked . <p> " With a cat-of-nine-tails until you could see his ribs , " said Breyfogle . <p> " God , I 'm sorry , Peter . " <p> " It healed at sunset . Ca n't permanently hurt the living dead . Damned unpleasant at the time , though . " He stopped struggling against Breyfogle . " We ca n't beat magic . Jan , what can we possibly do ? " <p> " All hands aft . " The bull-necked man cracked his whip . In seconds , the entire crew  --  over forty men  --  stood in two long lines facing the poop deck . At the front of the poop deck , there were two doors and two stairways leading to the top . <p> The men swayed with the plunging of the ship . Spray cascaded over the bow and across the deck . Yet the sun shone brightly , and a few yards from the Flying Dutchman , the waves lapped languidly . <p> The music , such as it was , reached a crescendo . Slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , turned his back and ascended the stairs to the poop . <p> In spite of his own circumstances , Jan could n't help examining Vandervecken with the eye of a professional historian . He wore a thick blue coat with short tails , broad bottomed trousers , and a hat the size of a pizza pan . He had a black eye patch and a wooden leg which thumped with each step , and a thick leather belt with several pistols thrust inside it , plus a cutlass , and a cat-of-nine-tails whip . A cliche pirate , Jan thought , but then he realized this was the original from which the cliche sprang . <p> Now on the poop deck , Vandervecken turned to face the crew and bellowed , " Bring forth the brides . " <p> The door below the poop deck opened . Out came a man tugging a chain . <p> At the other end of the chain , dragged like a dog by a leash , was Frieda . <p> " Frieda ! " Jan shouted , running to her . <p> " Jan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wore a long dress cobbled together from a dozen different garments . Her face was pale , her hair rumpled and whipping in the wind . She 'd lost weight . Her hands were chained in front of her . Behind her , also chained , stood Sarah . <p> The man jerked the chain , pulling Frieda face forward to the deck . Jan kicked him in the knee cap , then ripped the chain from his hands . Astonishingly , he did not resist , just stood staring as if thunderstruck . Jan helped Frieda up and gave her the hug of her life . <p> " Who dares touch a bride of Vandervecken ? " Vandervecken roared . He leaned over the rail of the poop deck , the cat-of-nine-tails in his hand . <p> " She 's not your bride , she 's mine , " Jan shouted back . <p> " What ? This is true ? " Vandervecken looked at Frieda . Frieda nodded . <p> " Ha . You told me you were a virgin . " <p> Frieda shrugged . " You said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " The bride of Vandervecken must be a virgin ! You ? " He pointed to Sarah . <p> " Me ? Hardly . I 'm from Marin County , " she said . <p> " You 're plain out of luck , chum . " Jan bent over to check the thick iron bands and the crude locks of Frieda 's chains . Antique stuff , more rust than iron . One good strike with a hammer would shatter them . <p> " Look out ! " Frieda screamed . A sudden blow on the back of the head nearly dazed him . Looking up , Jan saw Vandervecken grinning down at him . With an expert flick of the whip , Vandervecken made the balls at the end of each cat tail dance . <p> Jan grabbed at the whip . It flashed out of his reach , then caught him in the face , slashing his cheek wide open . Blood spurted down his neck and chest . Screaming , Jan ran to the steps and charged up . Vandervecken stood at the top of the stairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheek . When he threw up his hands to protect his face , the whip caught him full on the testicles . Shocked with pain , he instinctively lowered his hands . The next blow gouged out his eyes . <p> " Eggs or eyes , " Vandervecken roared . " You ca n't hold them both . " <p> Jan could n't see . Blood spurted down his face . Now the cat slashed his temple . Dazed with pain , he stumbled , falling from the steps onto the main deck , landing on his left elbow . He heard the bone snap like a dry stick . Frieda screamed . <p> Now Vandervecken and someone else stood over him . Rough hands plucked away his clothes . Soon Jan lay naked on the splintered wooden deck . He could hear Vandervecken bellow with laughter and smell the stink of his own blood . Then Vandervecken started working with the cat . Jan lifted his good hand to save himself , but the cat flicked here and there , always catching him by surprise . <p> Blind , smothered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> He came to on a bunk deep inside the ship . The bunk heaved and lurched with every motion of the storm-bound Flying Dutchman . <p> " Here . Drink this . It 's not good , but it 's hot . " Peter held Jan 's head in his lap and pressed a tin cup to his lips . Obediently , Jan gulped down the hot liquid , some kind of broth . It stank like rotten meat . <p> Hanging on a chain from the low roof , a lantern swayed back and forth , flinging fantastic shadows everywhere . A dozen other bunks lined the walls , each one with a sleeping man in it . <p> " I can see ! " Jan said . <p> " Yes . Like I said before , the living dead heal at sunset . Whatever body you had when you came aboard is the one you have when you leave . If you ever do . " <p> " Thank God . " <p> " Maybe . The bad news is that Vandervecken will do the same thing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new . " <p> " No . I ca n't possibly endure that again . " <p> " You have to . " <p> " I ca n't . I 'll go mad . We have to get out of here . " <p> " There does n't seem to be a way other than breaking the original curse . " <p> " And how do we do that ? " <p> " We do n't . Has to be a woman . If Vandervecken can find a woman who is true to him unto death , the curse will be lifted . Fat chance . They do n't make women that stupid . " <p> The ship 's bell clanged . <p> " Got to go . You get some rest , " Peter said . He rose , and in a second , he was gone . <p> When sleep finally came , Jan dreamed of the last act of Wagner 's the Flying Dutchman . The over-rich , cloying music climbed to a crescendo as a young woman , madly in love with Vandervecken , filled the concert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pledging her troth , she committed suicide by diving into the ocean . Stage left , the fake waves swept back and forth , while a ship the size of a canoe sank beneath the floor . <p> Jan turned over and moaned . Something from that opera nagged at the corner of his mind . A line , maybe a bit of dialogue or a note in the program . Something important . <p> " Up , up , you lazy dog . " Jan woke to find Breyfogle standing over hi m like a bearded mountain . He clapped his hands together to make a loud smack . " Take that , worthless sluggard . " He slapped his hands twice more . " That 'll teach you to be smart with me , " he roared . Then , in a whisper , he said , " Better you start screaming now . " <p> Jan screamed . <p> " Louder . " <p> Jan screamed as loud as he could . <p> " Touch me , you dog ! Let that be a lesson to you ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got to get up . Act hurt , or I 'll be in trouble . " <p> " Oh . Thank you . I 'll be miserable . What 's going on ? " <p> " Vandervecken wants you on deck . " <p> Involuntarily , Jan 's muscles tightened . " I ca n't face that man . " <p> " You must come . Or I must drag you , and I have no wish to hurt you . But I have even less wish to be hurt myself . " <p> There was no choice . In seconds , Jan was up on deck , cold wind and spray licking at his face . Glancing at the horizon , he was astonished to see the old boat he had bought still floating nearby . He would have thought they would have sailed far beyond it during the night . But then , he realized , if this ship had been trying to round the cape for nearly 150 years , it could n't be going anywhere fast . <p> " This time , with the cat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lie down , pull your knees to your chest , and cover your face . It will all heal tonight . " <p> Breyfogle pushed Jan across the deck . The wind whipped his hair in his face . <p> Only then did Jan notice the squealing music . Vandervecken had all hands drawn up in lines just like the day before . Frieda and Sarah stood in chains . Vandervecken strode the poop deck , making the lead beads of his cat-of-nine-tails dance in the wind . <p> " Ah , ha , my friend . You need another lesson today ? " Vandervecken cracked the whip . <p> Jan shrank back . His stomach rose ; he felt like vomiting . He could not go through this again . <p> Breyfogle shoved him forward . Two other men grabbed his arms while others stripped him and lashed his wrists to the stair railings . Vandervecken , taking his time , humming a tune , came down the stairs . The whip flickered here , there , around Jan 's body , anticipating but not touching . <p> " So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend ? " Vandervecken said . The irritating tune he hummed ricocheted through Jan 's mind like an errant cannonball . He 'd heard it before . <p> The cat cracked in the air . <p> The sound cleared Jan 's mind . Now he remembered the tune . From the opera , of course . And now he remembered the line he 'd been trying to recall last night . <p> " Do n't touch me , Vandervecken , " he shouted . " The curse is fulfilled . We are all free ! " <p> Vandervecken only laughed . The whip slipped over Jan 's shoulder , each lead bead like a sharp nail against his skin . <p> " First , you must find a woman true to me unto death . Do you see any such ? " Vandervecken said . <p> " Yes ! There 's one in front of you . Frieda . " <p> Vandervecken roared with laughter . " That one ? She true to me ? She fights like a tiger . " <p> " No . That 's not the condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unto death . Nothing about true to you . But she was true to me . She died taking the arrow intended for me ! " <p> Instantly , the entire crew hushed . Vandervecken stood , his mouth open , the whip swinging in the wind . Then suddenly the storm stopped , the Flying Dutchman halting in mid-plunge so abruptly it tossed everyone sprawling to the deck . <p> " The curse is broken ! " Peter shouted , leaping to his feet . He opened a clasp knife and sawed away at the ropes binding Jan . Meanwhile , the crew staggered like drunks , trying to regain their land legs after centuries of perpetual storm at sea . Voices chattered in Dutch and English . <p> Jan 's ropes broke away . " Let 's get Frieda and Sarah and get the hell out of here , " he said to Peter , running to where the women stood . He gave Frieda a quick hug , then tugged uselessly at her chains . Why had n't he thought to bring some tools ? <p> " Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . He produced an enormous antique key and unlocked the chains . Frieda and Sarah stood rubbing their wrists , trying to restore their hands ' circulation . <p> " The ship is sinking ! " someone yelled . Immediately a dozen other voices took up the cry . Jan looked around . Now that the curse had gone , the Flying Dutchman had become just another old ship badly in need of maintenance . As an historian , he would have loved to save it for a museum , but at the moment that did n't seem to be an option . <p> " Make for that boat over there ; " he shouted to the helmsman , pointing to his own craft in the distance . Obediently the helmsman put the wheel about , and the Flying Dutchman heeled . <p> " No ! I will not have it ! " Vandervecken waved two long-barreled pistols at Jan . " The first man to desert this ship dies . " He stepped to the railing of the poop deck , trying to cover everyone with his pistols . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what had happened . It was n't really the pistols that frightened them . It was Vandervecken himself . Years of instant obedience could not be erased in an afternoon . He had to break that spell . He looked around for something to distract the crew 's attention , even for a second . <p> The albatross . Sunlight gleaming from its long , snowy wings , it soared overhead , a mere ann 's length from the main mast , blessing the ship and all its crew . <p> " Look . Up there ! The albatross , " Jan shouted . " The bird of good omen . " <p> " He 's right ! " one man screamed , " it 's a sign from heaven . " The sailors shouted like children , singing , shouting , dancing with glee . <p> " Okay , we 're out of here , " Jan muttered to Frieda , who had already peeled out of her long skirts and was helping Sarah with hers . <p> " No . It is not a bird of good omen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'll show you what happens to those who defy me . " He raised both pistols , taking careful aim . <p> " No ! Do n't shoot the albatross ! " Jan shouted . <p> Two spurts of smoke burst from the pistols , followed by twin thunderclaps . The albatross fell to the poop deck with a sickening thud , feathers fluttering down after it . <p> Vandervecken picked up the fallen body , then made the wings flap in a grotesque parody of flight . <p> " Now we 're in for it , " Jan said . <p> " What do you mean ? It 's just a bird , " Peter said . <p> " No , it 's the embodiment of luck , and Vandervecken killed it . Just like the Ancient Mariner . " <p> Laughing heartily , Vandervecken draped the dead albatross around his neck like a feathery scarf . <p> " That does it ! " Jan shouted , his voice cracking with sudden fear . " Abandon ship ! Everyone overboard now ! " <p> Jan helped Frieda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the sea . Then he straddled the railing himself , hesitating just a second as he looked down at the frigid water sweeping along under him . Vandervecken pulled out another pistol . <p> Jan leaped . He cleared the ship 's side and plunged into the clear gray-green Antarctic water . Freezing , he swam with clumsy but determined strokes . <p> He was only dimly aware that others were swimming as well . When he at last reached his boat , his hands were so cold he could merely scratch helplessly at the side . <p> A bearded face looked down at him . " Ha . Much bedder now you not drown , " said the sailor . The man grabbed Jan 's arm and pulled him over the gunwale . <p> For a few seconds , Jan huddled with the others at the bottom of the boat . Frieda . Sarah . Peter . He hugged them all , grasping their hands , pulling them closer to his heart . The boat was packed with sailors , with Breyfogle already bellowing orders to get the rigging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last-second panic ? " Peter asked . " The curse is broken . He could n't do much . " <p> Jan shuddered , and not from the cold . " One curse is broken . But what about shooting the albatross ? Did n't you ever read Coleridge ? " <p> He pulled himself up to look over the side . Everywhere there was movement . Waves sparkled in the breeze , seagulls fluttered around the mast , clouds raced by high overhead . <p> In all this animation , only the Flying Dutchman remained motionless , sitting utterly and unnaturally still . . . as idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean . <p> <p> By Kent Patterson and Jerry Oltion <p> In March of this year , Kent Patterson died of a heart attack .
