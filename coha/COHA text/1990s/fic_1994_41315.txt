Tonight my son was mugged and here miles away I walk the streets and I think about a horse , a blind horse in Montana . Why the horse I do not know . I walk and I think of him , of the blind horse , and I try to fit the stories together . The stories matter , but the fit , the fit I can not make . He , he is my son and he is miles away . <p> I stand on the corner beside the pay telephone . The telephone rings and <p> I pick up the receiver . My wife does not say hello , my wife says our son has been mugged . I hear my wife 's voice shaking . She says our son is at a friend 's house , that he is talking to the police I think she is trying not to cry . My wife says she will call back in an hour . The phone goes dead . I have said nothing . <p> I stand on the street corner silent . I put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of the horse . I want to talk to my son . I want to know if my son is hurt . I want to know who could hurt my son . <p> I ball my fists and I begin to walk and I walk faster and I walk faster . <p> Why would anyone mug an eight-year-old boy ? What could anyone get from an eight-year-old boy ? Why would anyone hurt my son ? <p> I look at the signpost and I look at my watch . I have walked too far , much too far . My wife will call and I will not be there . The telephone will ring and I will not answer . It will ring and I will not be there , not be there unless I run . Someone else will answer unless I run . <p> I pump my arms and blow my breath in and out through my teeth and I run . I run fast , bumping into people , knocking people against department-store windows , pushing people back inside doorways , knocking their packages to the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have to be there even if I am too late . <p> I cut across the street and I run in the far-left lane of traffic . The cars , they come at me and they flash their lights and they honk their horns and they splash salt and slush at me as they weave by and I run and I feel the wet seep into my shoes and I run harder yet . <p> At nine-fifty , at ten minutes before ten , I reach the pay telephone , the telephone where my wife will call me at ten . I position myself in front of the telephone . I put my hands on the top of the telephone box . I spread my legs wide . I wait for the telephone to ring . No one is getting near that telephone until I have finished my ten o'clock call . No one is getting near that telephone until I know how my son is , until I have talked to my son , until I know what has happened . <p> I drop my head and my head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listen for the first ring , to hear my wife 's call . My head rests there and I catch my breath and I wait to speak to my wife and to my son . <p> At ten o'clock my wife 's voice greets me , my wife 's voice says hello . The voice sounds controlled , the voice sounds sweet . This time the voice does not shake . My wife says that she is fine , that our son is in the shower , that she wants the time to tell me what to say and what not to say to our son . I grip the receiver , I push the receiver against my ear . I spread my feet wider and they slip on the ice and snow . My lips tremble with the cold . <p> Our son , she tells me , our son was returning from the museum with a friend . It was light outside , still safe , about half past four . At the underpass our son and his friend were accosted , she says , accosted by five black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my wife interrupts and says , our son did not designate the boys as black . It proves , she says , that race does not play an active role in our son 's life . It proves , she says , that we have raised our son right , that he does not know the difference between blacks and whites , or at least that he does not care . It proves that we were right to send our son to public schools , that Chicago is good for him . Our son only mentioned that the boys were black when a policeman asked him if the five boys were black , that is what my wife says . <p> I pull my feet together and I shiver and I ask , please tell me what has happened , what has happened to my son . Five boys , five black boys , she says , jumped down from the elevated tracks and they hit our son , she says , and they hit his friend . They hit them in the face and then they hit them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his friend , she says , walked three blocks to a pay telephone . They walked to a pay telephone and there at the pay telephone my son called his mother to tell her not to worry , to tell her not to be mad that he had a bloodied nose , that his new coat had blood down the front of it . My son said that he and his friend wanted to walk home , that that 's what they preferred . He said that they did not want my wife to drive to the pay telephone , drive to give them a ride home . <p> My wife 's voice is calm and she tells me that it is calm because everything is O.K. She tells me her voice shook before because when she called before she had just learned that the parents of our son 's friend had called the police . They had called the police and the police were there at their house speaking to our son and they had not bothered to tell her that they had called the police or that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When our son told his mother about being mugged , when he came home and told her about the boys , the five black boys , he had said that he did not want to call the police . What angered my wife , what made her voice shake , what she found so rude , was that she did not know that the parents of our son 's friend had called the police . She did not know that the parents of our son 's friend had our son in their house talking to the police . She did not know any of this until she made the call to me . My wife found out that our son was talking to the police only after she picked up the telephone and she dialed me there on my corner , there waiting , she found out only after a neighbor from across the hall knocked on our door and let herself into our apartment . <p> I hear my son asking to speak . He takes the phone and the only thing he will say , the only thing he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he will have a black eye . I ask him if he hurts , I ask him who the boys were , I ask him to tell me what the policemen said to him . What my son tells me he wants to talk to me about is that today he saw a baby chick hatch , that today he saw a baby chick hatch in the incubator at the museum . My son says that before today his goal in life has been to go to the museum and to see a baby chick poke its beak out of an egg , to see a chick break open an egg and be born . That was his goal in life , that is why he goes to the museum , not for the coal mine or the submarine , not for the walk-through plastic heart , but to see a chick , a real live chick poke its beak through an egg and be born . <p> Today , he tells me , today as my son stood looking into the incubator , stood leaning against the glass and looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big and brown , today he saw a beak poke through an egg . My son says that the beak poked through the egg and the beak opened and the beak crowed . My son swears that he heard a cock-a-doodle-do , heard it through the glass , and he says that the cock-a-doodle-do means that the chick is a rooster , only roosters can crow , he says . For one hour and fifty-six minutes my son sat next to the incubator watching his watch to see how long it took , watching the watch I sent from New York , watching it for one hour and fifty-six minutes , watching what he calls his chick be born . Peck by peck my son gives me an account of his chick 's birth , and peck by peck in the cold I hear his voice telling me the miracle he has seen , the story of a wet yellow-and-brown chick poking its head out of an egg , breaking the egg apart , spreading its wings , flapping and falling and getting up again . Will the chick , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all that darkness ? my son asks . <p> I almost miss the question . I hold the receiver away from me and I look into it . My son has me back at my childhood home , back in Montana thinking about a baby cat , a tiny little white cat being born , coming to life on my stomach . I bring the receiver back to my head . <p> " Dad , are you still there ? Dad , will my chick be O.K. ? " I remind my son of the lights in the incubator . He interrupts and tells me that there are six bulbs in the incubator , that he has counted them , that there are six lights at the top of the incubator that shine down on the eggs , that shine down like an angel 's halo , he says . I tell my son that the bulbs generate heat to help the eggs develop , that the lights keep the unborn chicks in the eggs warm the way the mother hen keeps her eggs warm in a nest , keeps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me that he likes putting his face up to the glass , that he likes feeling how warm the glass feels against his face , against his nose . Those lights are never turned off , I say . The baby chick will be under those lights tonight , is under them right now , safe and warm My son says thank you and he hands the phone to my wife . My wife says I love you , and I say I miss you , and my wife hangs up the telephone , and I listen until I hear the line go dead . <p> On the street corner I stand , in the salty slush of New York winter I stand , and I remember Montana . I look at the Christmas-tree lights . I look at the Santa with his potbelly and black kettle and silver bell and I remember all the calves , the lambs , the chicks , the puppies , the kittens I saw born back home . <p> I walk toward my room . I step over a man lying in the street . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching that beak poke up out of the egg and I remember the horse , the blind horse comes back to me . <p> Twelve weeks before graduation . I was going to Boys ' State . I had the promise of a scholarship from the Masonic Lodge , a full scholarship to whatever college I wanted . Things were right . Things were made , except for basketball . The coach would not let me play . Every game , game after game , I sat on the bench and I watched our team win . <p> never played , I sat there no matter how big our lead . Three games to go , I quit the team . I took the money that the Lion 's Club gave me for Boys ' State and I bought a trunk load of beer . <p> My best friend and I drank the beer , drank as much as we could , drank during the first half of the game , drank through half time , and at the jump for the final quarter I walked onto the court in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ball and I fell . I fell face down and could not get up . I slipped on the freshly varnished floor and I fell again . The coach , the coach who had kept me on the bench for three and <p> half years , the coach who was the town 's hero because we were winning , picked me up and pushed me out the gym doors , out into a snow drift , out into the cold . <p> The school principal called my best friend and me into his office . The school principal put my best friend and me on probation . The principal looked at me across his desk and the principal told me that I would not be going to Boys ' State , told me that I would not represent the school , that no one would go this year . He looked at me and he told me that the Masonic Lodge would have no money for me , that there would be no scholarship , that he , the principal , would write every college to which I had applied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I had spent the money from the Lion 's Club , that I had gotten drunk and had interrupted a game , an important game against the Sheridan Panthers , that <p> had made a drunken fool of my school , of myself , of my family . <p> Only one college would take me , one college that knew my father , a religious school , a school where no one , not even the principal , would suspect I would go . They did not ask any questions . They knew my father . <p> Money , money was the problem . I needed money for tuition and for room and for board . I needed $2,000 . I should have sold the beer . <p> Two hundred dollars a horse , the math was simple . I needed ten green colts , ten ranchers who could not break the colts themselves , ten ranchers who needed me . My best friend and I drove to the court house and we read through the hospital sections of all that winter 's Valley Times . We read through each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list of every rancher who had been in the hospital that winter , every rancher who might still be stoved up , every rancher who could use me , and I called them all , called each and every one and asked if I could break their colts , lied and told them that my father would help . <p> What surprised me was that my father was impressed . He looked at the list and he listened to my calls and he agreed to pay me to break the gray colt he had bought that winter , the gray colt with blood going back to the King Ranch in Texas , the gray colt he had always wanted . <p> I arranged a schedule , two colts every five weeks , two colts until all ten colts were broken and I had $2,000 and it was time to enroll in my father 's university . Our neighbor had fallen off a haystack and had broken his hip and had had to crawl in the snow , in forty-below weather , had had to crawl two miles to the county road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took him and all the school children to the county hospital . I began with his horse , a bay colt , and my father 's gray colt . <p> I rode my horse to our neighbor 's ranch and found the bay colt in the corral where the neighbor said it would be . I moved my horse into the corral . My horse sidled up next to the bay colt and I slipped a noose over the bay colt 's head . The colt looked too wide at the withers and too thick in the legs to be a two-year-old ; it came up flush with my horse and looked at least as old . The neighbor rolled his wheelchair into the corral and I asked the neighbor how old the bay colt was . Our neighbor stroked his bay colt up and down the colt 's front legs . Without looking up at me , with his attention focused on the colt , our neighbor told me that the colt was four years old . Still not looking at me and still stroking the colt 's legs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colt 's age . I told him no and , keeping the colt tight against my horse , the two horses and I headed home at a stiff trot . <p> I put the neighbor 's four-year-old bay colt in the corral . I unsaddled my horse and let him loose . I took the halter and the rope with which my father worked his gray each night , making the colt circle in ever bigger circles in the corral , head up at a full run , rope taut between him and my father , and I walked to where my father 's gray stood beside the barn . My father 's gray saw me with my outstretched hand and nuzzled up to me . The gray colt ate the oats from my hand and I slipped the halter on the colt . I tied the rope to the halter . I led my father 's gray to the corral and placed him in the corral with the neighbor 's bay colt . <p> The two colts nuzzled each other , smelling each other 's smell , then they bared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at each other 's neck . I pushed myself between the two colts . I put the halter back on my father 's gray and I led my father 's gray out of the corral . I stroked the gray colt up and down his withers . I could feel the gray colt relax . I took the gray back to the corral and put him inside with the bay colt . I closed the gate and climbed on the fence to watch . The colts sniffed each other again , running their noses up and down each other 's body . Then the bay colt tried again to nip my father 's gray . The gray colt turned and planted a kick into the bay colt 's ribs . I watched the bay stagger , then run to the far corner . I smiled and got down from the fence and headed inside the house to tell my father what his gray colt had done to the neighbor 's four-year-old bay . <p> In the morning I caught my father 's gray colt and led him to the creek for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the corral and led me there . The neighbor 's bay was a different story . I slipped the halter on the bay colt , opened the gate , and the bay took off running . I dropped to my stomach and tried to wrap the rope around my hands . Round the pasture the bay pulled me until I hit a boulder and the rope slipped through my hands . I walked back to the house and caught my horse . I saddled my horse and took my father 's lasso off my father 's saddle . At a full run I rode my horse after the bay colt . I roped the bay and dragged him back to the corral . <p> For a week I carried buckets of water to the corral and each day that week I worked the bay in the corral , worked him with the halter and rope the way I had watched my father work his gray until I thought that the bay colt would not run with me in tow again . I got a longer halter rope . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colt 's halter . The other end of the rope I half-hitched twice round my waist . <p> The bay colt and I stepped outside the corral and the bay took off running . I snapped the rope hard twice . The bay colt did not stop . I tried to untie the rope . My head struck a telephone pole , knocking the pole to the ground and breaking the rope round my waist . I was conscious when my father drove the pickup to the telephone pole and lifted me into the truck . <p> Eight days I had to stay in the hospital , eight days . I saw a rancher with whom I had contracted to break a colt . He had not tied the strings on the back of his gown and the nurses were snickering . The school principal sent me a get-well card ; no one else but my best friend came to visit . <p> My father drove me home . I was surprised that my father was not angry . My father only said it was stupid of me to have tied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my return I began working with the gray colt and the bay colt again . I worked the two colts in the corral with the halter rope and with the buggy whip . My father had been working the colts while I was in the hospital , I could tell . One at a time , I walked the colts to water , the gray first then the bay . Both colts , even the neighbor 's bay colt , walked calmly to the water , drank , and calmly walked back to the corral . I worked with the colts in the corral for two hours more . I put bridles , saddle blankets , and saddles on them . Then I took off the bridles , saddle blankets , and saddles . I repeated the process five times . <p> In the evening I took the colts out to drink without a warm-up in the corral . I took the neighbor 's bay to the creek first . The bay colt gave me no problem . Then I took my father 's gray to the creek . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off at a full run . I had the lead rope wrapped round my waist again . This time , the lead rope unwrapped on its own and I fell to the ground , fell on top of a long , thick branch . I picked up the branch and grabbed it by one end . I threw the branch at the gray colt . End over end I watched the branch fly toward the gray colt , fly into the gray 's eye , fly into that eye and stick . The colt shook his head back and forth and the branch stayed stuck in his eye . The colt bucked high , flying up into the air , and the branch dropped to the ground . <p> I knew what I had done . I ran to my father 's gray to soothe him . Every time I got close to the gray he ran away from me . <p> Not until hours later would the gray let me touch him . I stroked his jaw and I stared at his eye , at the eye into which I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood trickled out of it . Around the edge of the eye pink flesh and small yellow globules of fat protruded . Where the branch had stuck , there where I had stuck that branch , there , there was nothing but darkness . I stroked the gray , I stroked my father 's gray colt and I cried . I knelt next to the gray , knelt down by his legs , and I prayed . I prayed that the gray colt 's eye would heal , I prayed that the gray colt would forgive me , I prayed that my father would forgive me . <p> I knew that nobody would forgive me . My father came up from behind me still out there in that field and I told my father the truth . I told him that I had thrown a branch at his gray colt . I told him that I had blinded his gray colt . I was crying hard , my father was crying hard . My father slapped my face . My father put his arms round his gray colt 's neck and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I remained in the pasture that night . The next morning I went back to the house . I changed my clothes and I went to school . I did not see my father then or ever again . I stayed out late every night , until after midnight , until he was in bed , I stayed out with my best friend and we drank beer , drank the beer that we had stashed down by the lake , the beer that I had bought with the money from the Lion 's Club , the money for Boys ' State . The day school ended , my best friend and I loaded the trunk of my car with the last of the beer . I left that night for my father 's alma mater . <p> To pay for tuition I worked as a janitor from four o'clock until eight o'clock each morning and each night I locked the university 's buildings . I did not have to worry about board . I lived in my car up Canyon Creek , just above my father 's university , up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having to start the engine and use gas . <p> My best friend never did manage to attend college . He wrote me occasionally , wrote me one letter that has stuck with me all these years . He wrote that my father broke all eight remaining colts . I do not know if he broke them for me or if he broke them for the money . But break the colts my father did . <p> Now I walk and I wait for the stories to fit , to fit together , to make sense of each other . I walk these cold streets and I look at people shopping , buying Christmas presents , carrying packages home . I try to understand but I can not . The thing I do know , the thing that does make sense , the fit that I see , the thing I think now as I walk these streets is , my father is two thousand miles away and my son , my only son is almost a thousand miles away and maybe , please Father in Heaven no , please no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
