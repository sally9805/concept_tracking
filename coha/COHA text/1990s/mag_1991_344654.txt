In 1986 the former history professor , who had spent more than two decades with the Central Committee 's international department , was made a top adviser to the man who had recently become the leader of the Soviet Union . In August 1991 , over four desperate days , he shared house arrest with his President . <P> When Gorbachev and his family went on vacation to the Crimea in early August , Chernyayev , 70 , and other members of the presidential staff accompanied them , staying at a health resort called Yuzhny , some seven miles from the presidential compound . During the day , Chernyayev and his team worked in offices just a few yards away from Zarya , the Gorbachevs ' dacha ; one of their assignments was to help the President put the finishing touches on a speech scheduled for Tuesday , Aug. 20 , to mark the signing of his cherished union treaty , under which the center would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the republics . Here , Chernyayev describes what happened at the dacha beginning Aug. 18 and why he decided to publish his tale . <P> " I began to write a chronicle of events on Aug. 21 while confined with the President . I have witnessed a turning point in history . <P> " When I left my room I put it under the carpet or behind the wardrobe ; I had the impression that somebody came into my room during my absences . I made some additions later , very shortly after we came back to Moscow . I did not plan to publish these notes , and only scribbled something down mechanically , subconsciously hoping that ' manuscripts do not burn ' ( ( an allusion to the work of the early 20th century writer Mikhail Bulgakov , author of The Master and Margarita ) ) . <P> " I did not have much hope at the time .

As usual , two police cars stood at the entrance , and a barbed-wire strip was stretched across the road . They moved it aside a little for us to pass . <P> At about 5 o'clock , Olga ran in : " Anatoli Sergeyevich ! What 's happening ?

I 've never seen him . " I saw a convoy of cars with aerials , some of them with lights flashing on the roofs , at the entrance of the office building , a swarm of drivers and guards .

I picked up a receiver , another one and still another  --  all dead , including the satellite line . <P> We began wondering what it all could possibly mean . I was musing aloud about some breakdown at a nuclear power plant  --  that would explain Baklanov 's presence . But it turned out much worse than that !
