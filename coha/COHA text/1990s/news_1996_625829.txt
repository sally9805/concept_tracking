<p> THE repertory of Shakespeare 's " Julius Caesar " and " Antony and Cleopatra , " opening this week , promises to be a milestone for the Alley Theater - and perhaps for international cultural exchange , as well . <p> The project contains several intriguing and potentially powerful matchups . Vanessa Redgrave is making her American directing debut and Houston stage debut in " Antony and Cleopatra . " She also will play Portia in " Julius Caesar . " <p> Corin Redgrave , Vanessa 's brother and a leading British actor renowned for classical and contemporary roles , is making his U.S. stage debut as director and star of " Julius Caesar . " Redgraves acting Shakespeare is a generations-old tradition that has resulted in some of the theater 's most inspiring adventures , on both sides of the Atlantic . Vanessa and Corin 's late father , Sir Michael Redgrave , was one of the foremost Shakespearean actors of this century . The siblings ' presence here is a rare opportunity for American theatergoers to see two members of the acting dynasty doing what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The most surprising pairing may be between the Redgraves ' bold young London-based Moving Theater , founded in 1994 , and Houston 's Alley , one of America 's oldest and best-regarded regional companies , founded in 1947 . <p> The Shakespeare project marks the Alley 's first true international collaboration of acting companies - nine actors from the Alley and nine from Moving Theater merging as a single company . <p> This is not a one-time event . Before the concluding performance on Feb. 11 , the Alley plans to announce its next collaboration with Moving Theater . It will take the Alley actors to Great Britain later this year , to rehearse and premiere a show there , then bring it back as part of the Alley 's 1996-97 season . <p> " " Is it a big deal ? It 's a very big deal , " said Jack O'Brien , artistic director of the Old Globe in San Diego . " " First , if there is a better actor or actress living on the face of the Earth than Vanessa Redgrave , I do n't know who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I 'm concerned . I can only imagine that to work with her onstage would change the professional direction of everyone involved . <p> " " Having Vanessa and Corin Redgrave to learn from and measure up against is a great opportunity for any company . And it 's great that they 're not just bringing over their company to ' show how it 's done , ' but mixing British and American actors from both companies . <p> " " I 'm sure the Brits would be the first to say that American actors are just as capable of doing Shakespeare - they just do n't get the chance to do it as often . " <p> Among the newspapers that will send critics to the productions are the New York Times and the Los Angeles Times . <p> " " The question I get from other artistic directors , " said Alley artistic director Gregory Boyd , " " is , ' How did you do it ? ' " The Boyd/Redgrave connection began thanks to renowned British stage director Sir Peter Hall . Hall visited Houston in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Houston Grand Opera . While here , he attended Boyd 's production of " Measure for Measure " at the Alley , and he returned to England singing its praises . <p> When Vanessa Redgrave expressed an interest in collaborating with an American company , Hall told her the Alley would be an ideal choice . Redgrave and Boyd had their first exchange of letters soon after and have been searching for the right time and project ever since . <p> In the meantime , Lynn Redgrave came to the Alley for a triumphant run of her solo show " Shakespeare for My Father . " She , too , sent glowing reports to Vanessa and Corin . Indeed , Boyd recalls attending a birthday party for one of Corin 's children at which Lynn delighted guests with her imitations of Alley staff and company members . <p> When Corin , Vanessa and five other founding artistic directors launched their Moving Theater in 1994 , that moved the collaboration closer to realization . <p> " " It 's an enormous coup for a number of reasons , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the first time that an American company and an English company have merged , working together to create a production . It 's testing in live performance the whole question of what acting is , the difference in the techniques and styles of British vs . American actors . <p> " " Traditionally , we think of British actors in terms of classical training , an intellectual approach , and American actors as more intuitive , emotional and Method-oriented . With their background , Corin and Vanessa know these plays so well , but they also bring a modern way to look at the plays , not some ossified tradition . <p> " " It 's an interesting combination - the deeply felt emotional acting with a tip of the hat to the classical tradition . The Alley actors are taking to it like ducks to water . <p> " " It 's important for every company to raise its eyes from its own navel and look for connection . So it 's a process of discovery for everyone in this new joint company . " <p> The twin productions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complex schedules and the unique arrangements required by English and American Equity actors ' unions make it impossible for the productions to travel . <p> The visiting British artists can remain here for 11 weeks only , including rehearsal and performance time . The American artists then must visit Great Britain for 11 weeks within the next 18 months - which confirms the further Moving Theater/Alley collaboration . <p> " " Arranging a cultural exchange of this sort is a red-tape feast , " said Alley managing director Paul Tetreault . " " Special permission from the unions , arranging visas for everyone . But now that everyone is here , it 's going wonderfully well . <p> " " Both Corin and Vanessa are terrific at blending all the actors together . It 's no longer a British ensemble and an American ensemble , but one company . They really are soul mates . I 've never seen two siblings work so well together . <p> It 's fascinating to watch . <p> " " Vanessa also is one of the most democratic people I 've ever met , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a star in the rehearsal hall . There 's no temperament . She insisted she 'd get no special treatment , staying in the same housing with the rest of the company . She and Corin really are a part of the ensemble . " <p> With two big , complex plays in simultaneous preparation , the company has been working 16-hour days . <p> Corin Redgrave said it 's always a tight pinch to have a production ready by opening night , on either side of the Atlantic . He squeezed in a Sunday morning interview before launching a day of rehearsals . <p> " " Nowhere do you really have sufficient time . Ideally , you could have three months for a major production , including one ( month ) on the set . Only a few companies in Germany and the USSR used to have that , and now even those companies do n't anymore . At most companies , you have to make do with three or four weeks . <p> " " You can still do it . But you also wish the critics would return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time it takes for a production to reach its ideal shape . " Corin Redgrave , prominent in such acclaimed recent films as " Persuasion " and " In the Name of the Father , " said he is happy to be working at the Alley . <p> " " The financial situation and the resources available here ( he cited such luxuries as the in-house costume and properties shops ) - all that makes it better here than at any company in England , outside of the national theater companies , such as the Royal Shakespeare Company and the Royal National Theater . " <p> He described this collaboration as an important step for Moving Theater . <p> " " Part of the founding idea of the Moving Theater was to create work with and through different artists , from different countries and different cultures . The idea of an ongoing collaboration between Alley Theater and Moving Theater is an exciting opportunity for both companies to work together . <p> We 're merging very well - genuinely enjoying working together . " <p> Part of that enjoyment for Corin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Shakespeare is universal and eternal , " he said . " " But it 's also true that certain of his plays live more at certain times than at others . When I was first starting in the theater in the 1960s , " Measure for Measure " was not that frequently seen . But because of different social circumstances and cultural conditions , it is much more frequently produced today , because it seems much more relevant . <p> " " That applies to both " Julius Caesar " and " Antony and Cleopatra . " They were written at a moment of furious upheaval in the world . Certain words reverberate through both plays : honorable , noble . " <p> Both plays touch on questions crucial to contemporary audiences , he said , " " particularly since we 're living at a time when most of us can no longer say - as John F. Kennedy once said - that we believe politics is a noble calling . " <p> " Julius Caesar " was written in 1599 , " Antony and Cleopatra " in 1607 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same story and include several common characters , they also indicate a change in Shakespeare 's dramaturgical technique . <p> " Julius Caesar " has remained one of the Bard 's more popular works through the centuries , not only for its forceful language and sharp character delineation , but also for its strong , sure narrative line . One of the most famous stagings this century was Orson Welles ' Mercury Theater production on Broadway in 1937 , in modern dress and with a streamlined ( 100-minute ) text containing specific references to the fascist dictatorships that had arisen in Europe . <p> " Antony and Cleopatra , " in contrast , has prompted more varied assessments . Many critics have relished it for some of the most sensuous and soaring language in the Shakespearean canon . Louis Kronenberger wrote that " " nothing much greater than Antony and Cleopatra has ever been written , " and Samuel Taylor Coleridge called it " " of all Shakespeare 's historical plays , by far the most wonderful . " <p> Yet others have found its narrative line faulty and lacking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cornell , Brooks Atkinson wrote , " " The tragedy is a difficult one with a broken story line , and few actresses have been happy in it . " <p> Actresses have been drawn to A &C; for the challenges and opportunities of Shakespeare 's Cleopatra . A famous staging cast Sir Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh in the title roles , alternating as George Bernard Shaw 's " Caesar and Cleopatra , " a repertory presented to acclaim in London and on Broadway in 1951 . Like the Redgrave rep at the Alley , that program offered two parts of the same story - but with vastly different authorial viewpoints . <p> Both Corin and Vanessa Redgrave maintain that negative assessments of " A &C's"; narrative arose from misguided productions that failed to accommodate Shakespeare 's cinematic style in this work : more than 40 brief scenes , some only a few lines long , never intended for realistic settings . <p> Most 19th- and early 20th-century stagings cut much of the political material , undermining the sense of the play ; instead they focused on the tragic romance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love , sentimentalizing that part and filling in the gaps with dancing girls and irrelevant spectacle . <p> " " Julius Caesar " has a stark simplicity , " said Corin Redgrave . " " Antony and Cleopatra , " however , defies all known rules of playmaking . Shakespeare seems to be destroying everything he 's done before , inventing new forms of narrative . <p> It 's fascinating to see how he is constantly reinventing new forms for his work - returning to the same story in " Antony and Cleopatra " but bringing a different experience . <p> " " Vanessa wants to return it to Shakespeare 's original meaning and Shakespeare 's time , " he said , noting that is also his approach with " Julius Caesar . " " " Both productions will be in Elizabethan/Jacobean garb . To be relevant today , they must be placed either in Shakespeare 's time or our own time . To dress them in togas does n't tell us about the times they were written in . Placing them in Shakespeare 's time makes them more relevant to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Royal Shakespeare Company when Trevor Nunn directed his famous 1972 repertory combining all four of Shakespeare 's Roman plays . <p> " " The connection with " Titus Andronicus " and " Coriolanus " was only superficial , and they did n't fit as well . But " Julius Caesar " and " Antony and Cleopatra " really do belong together , " he said . " " They have in common the whole matrix of ideas and fears that arise out of a situation of civil war , as well as Shakespeare 's quite brilliant perception of dictatorship . <p> " " They make a fascinating pair , both for their continuity and their differences .
