You name it , and Olympic track star Jeanette Bolden , 32 , is probably allergic to it . Household dust , cats , seafood . Just the smell of fish cooking on a grill is enough to make her eyes puff up and start to water . But Bolden 's allergies are linked to a more serious problem . Like 15 million other Americans , she suffers from asthma , a chronic affliction of the airways in the lungs that can turn the simplest act of breathing into hard labor and leave a person gasping , coughing and wheezing for air . Last fall the gold medalist ( 100-m relay , 1984 ) was hospitalized for a severe attack in which her airways closed off altogether . " Imagine slicing an orange and squeezing all the juice out of both halves , " Bolden suggests . " That 's how my lungs felt  --  as if someone or something was squeezing all the air out . " <P> Not long ago , Bolden 's asthma might have kept her from competing or even coaching . But asthma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they now believe they can keep most potentially fatal attacks at bay . They have found that allergies play a dual role in causing asthma to develop in the first place as well as in triggering individual episodes of wheezing . By studying families in which asthma appears to be inherited , scientists hope one day to discover the genes that predispose people to develop it . And by controlling the underlying irritation and inflammation of the lungs , most asthma patients should be able to enjoy a full and active life . <P> Despite these advances in knowledge , both the incidence and severity of asthma appear to be growing worldwide . Epidemics have been reported in Britain , Australia and New Zealand . In the U.S. , the number of asthma cases rose 70% from 1980 to 1989 . Even more alarming , the death rate , which had been declining steadily during most of the 1970s , began inexplicably increasing , and is now rising 8% a year . Asthma accounts for $5 billion in medical costs each year in the U.S. <P> Acute attacks of asthma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blocked . For reasons that are not entirely clear , the lungs are overstimulated by viral infections , allergens or pollutants . The body responds by activating various defense cells from the immune system . Their mobilization causes the airways to swell . At the same time , the muscles surrounding the airways contract , cutting off airflow . When that happens , asthmatics must inhale an adrenaline-like substance to stop the muscle spasm and reopen their airways . <P> If the attacks recur enough times , however , the lungs do not return to normal . They continue to act as if they are being invaded by parasites . This constant state of inflammatory alert damages the bronchial walls , creating scar tissue . As a result , the airways can no longer clear the mucus that forms deep in the lungs . The ensuing buildup reduces the flow of air and sets the stage for the next attack . " In olden times , which was only about five or 10 years ago , we all concentrated on the bronchospasm and assumed the patients were all right between episodes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Missouri . " Now we see that inflammation is there from the beginning even in mild or asymptomatic cases . "
