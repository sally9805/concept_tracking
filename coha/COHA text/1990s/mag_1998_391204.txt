<p> A sculptor named Mihail has created a life-size , anatomically correct elephant for the United Nations . There is sentiment for a gelded version , modeled no doubt on the Republican Party . <p> Kenneth Starr 's testimony before the House Judiciary Committee was calm , clear , and judicious . He was miles away from the slavering , censorious prude that the Clinton spin machine and the media have made him out to be . The questions of Clinton lawyer David Kendall and the Democrats ( to the extent they can be distinguished ) were carping , ill-tempered , and thunderously reticent about the subject under discussion , which is the alleged perjury of their client , Bill Clinton . Those not comatose from battle fatigue-which , alas , is hardly anyone at this point-would have been impressed by Starr 's case , and the President 's lack of one . History will do them justice , even if Congress does n't . <p> The historian Sean Wilentz has written a piece for the Los Angeles Times making the case against impeachment , on the grounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1804 , even though he had been indicted for murder after his duel with Alexander Hamilton . But Congress balked not because it doubted the scope of its power to impeach , but because of the status of dueling , a crime which contemporary juries regularly overlooked , on the rare occasions when it was prosecuted . It is heartening to see defenders of the President reduced to arguing that he should get off the hook because he resembles Aaron Burr . <p> In his answers to the House Judiciary Committee 's 81 questions , Bill Clinton understandably equivocated about whether or not he is the chief law enforcement officer in the land . Attorney General Janet Reno is apparently having similar doubts about her constitutional role . She now needs another sixty days to decide whether to ask for an independent counsel to investigate Harold Ickes 's alleged perjury before Congress . She has also decided not to seek an independent counsel in the case of Al Gore 's fundraising calls . The independent-counsel statute leaves Miss Reno little leeway : in any case that could reach top officials in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counsel if she can not dismiss the charge . Instead she is walking a legally dubious middle road , conducting an ineffectual investigation of her own to avoid the political fallout of what would be her preferred course : conducting no investigation at all . The New York Times says Reno is at risk of becoming " the most politically compromised Attorney General since Watergate . " She has already earned an epithet that should be just as damning : Bill Clinton 's Attorney General . <p> Pro-abortion Republicans like New Jersey Gov . Christine Todd Whitman are arguing that the elections show that one of them should be on the GOP 's next presidential ticket . This is implausible , since pro-lifers had a better election than Republicans did ( picking up a governorship , for example , while the GOP lost one ) . And who would this moderate Republican be ? If the purpose of choosing a pro-abortion vice presidential nominee is to court women , it makes little sense to pick Mrs. Whitman , who lost among women in both 1993 and 1997 . Gov . George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Democratic sweep of the other statewide offices , and polls , suggest that he could not carry his state for the GOP . Like Pataki , Pennsylvania Gov . Tom Ridge has been proposed as the first Catholic on a GOP ticket since 1964 . But to choose a pro-abortion Catholic would alienate the churchgoing Catholics who are within the GOP 's grasp . As if to underscore the point , Ridge 's bishop has told him he can no longer address Catholic audiences as long as he flouts Church teaching . <p> As part of the tobacco companies ' settlement with the state attorneys general , a few hundred trial lawyers are about to receive what may be the largest per capita wealth transfer in American history . Mike Horowitz of the Hudson Institute estimates the total payout at $30-40 billion , with some lawyers getting more than $100,000 for each hour they worked on the case . Lawyers who took real risks are justified in getting contingency fees-$4,000 an hour , say , compared with the $500 an hour the tobacco companies ' top lawyers get whether they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filed suit after the industry had already cried uncle , and after state laws were changed specifically to favor them . In many cases , attorneys general awarded the contracts , without competitive bids , to law firms that contributed to their campaigns . Reporters are looking the other way because the fees are supposedly being paid by the tobacco companies . But this is an accounting fiction : the fees reduce the damages awarded to the states because they come from the same pot of money . Congress would be well within its rights to cap the lawyers ' fees while waiving any federal claim to money under the settlement . That would leave most of the ill-gotten gains to the state treasuries-which beats leaving it to the left wing of the Democratic Party . <p> It 's the Democrats ' move on Social Security . Optimists think President Clinton , seeing a bipartisan deal as his legacy , might sign legislation to allow private investment options . Pessimists think Clinton , seeing President Al Gore as his legacy , will attack the idea . The latest word is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currently applies only to the first $68,400 of income , to all wages . This is simply a redistributive tax increase , and one that would at best solve one-fifth of Social Security 's fiscal problem . Fresher thinking can be found on the Senate Finance Committee , where Democrats John Breaux ( La . ) , Bob Kerrey ( Neb. ) , and Daniel Patrick Moynihan ( N.Y. ) are open to private accounts . Chuck Robb ( Va. ) , next in line to join the committee , could cinch a free-market deal-which is why Ted Kennedy ( Mass. ) wants to block his accession . Kennedy is trying to recruit a liberal with more seniority than Robb for the slot , and is willing to take it himself if necessary . Social Security is sacred to Democrats as a program and useful to them as a political issue . Which will they save ? <p> In Connecticut , as in other states and cities , taxpayers are being asked to subsidize some of the richest people in America : owners of sports franchises , and professional athletes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roughly $300-million tax surplus , along with a few hundred million more , to build a football stadium in Hartford . The goal is to " revitalize " the state 's dismal capital by wooing the New England Patriots away from Massachusetts , which had the sense to reject Patriot owner Robert Kraft 's demands . The best game plan for Connecticut lawmakers : punt ! <p> President Clinton called back the B-52s when Saddam Hussein promised " unconditional " cooperation with the UN inspectors , but the planes had hardly landed before Hussein was back to obstruction . He claims that key documents requested by the inspectors are missing and insists on bypassing the UN inspection team by talking only to the UN Secretariat . Thus Iraq has returned to its pre-October strategy , which is a more clever way of keeping the Clinton Administration off balance than outright confrontation . The weapons inspections , even at best , are a sideshow ; the real problem is the nature of the regime that would wield those weapons . America and Britain 's stumbling efforts to unify the Iraqi opposition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact . <p> Gen. Augusto Pinochet continues to wait while the Blair government decides whether to extradite him to Spain . In all the talk of British justice , international law , and Chilean sentiment , one word has been missing : Communism . For thirty years , Communism tried to take Latin American countries into its orbit . In Chile , it was on the point of succeeding until Gen. Pinochet launched a counterrevolutionary coup . Like Francisco Franco before him , he saved his country from totalitarian dictatorship . And like Franco , he paved the way for democracy . ( Fidel Castro , who came to power in Cuba in 1959 , is still there . ) The thousands of summary executions that accompanied Pinochet 's revolt were terrible . So was the firebombing of hundreds of thousands of enemy civilians by the Allies in World War II . But once war or revolution begins , the Rubicon is crossed . Happy is the land that needs no Pinochets . But Chile was happy to have produced one in its hour of need . <p> Tony Blair 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its 750 hereditary peers ( the 350 remaining peers are life peers , appointed by the party that controls the House of Commons ) . Why should a branch of the British constitution be dominated by the descendants of Norman buccaneers and Tudor cronies ? Because they are not present-day buccaneers and cronies . Positions earned by mere inheritance leaven government with a class of people who are not motivated by ambition or politics . If New Labour will take some advice from the world 's senior Republic , they might heed John Dickinson at the Constitutional Convention : " It was not reason that discovered the singular and admirable mechanism of the English constitution . It was not reason that discovered or ever could have discovered the odd mode of trial by jury . Accidents probably produced these discoveries , and experience has given a sanction to them . This is then our guide . " <p> Abdullah Ocalan , leader of the Kurdish terrorists who wage war against Turkey , was booted out of Syria in response to Turkish pressure . Ocalan made his way to Italy , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Turkey approached its NATO ally with a request for extradition . But Italy 's government , led by ex-Communists and egged on by the new leftist coalition in Germany , not only refused extradition but released Ocalan from prison and entertained his request for political asylum . Thus the " new Europe " demonstrates several of its unsavory features simultaneously : trendy , lefty swooning over radicals , appeasement of terrorism , anti-Turkish prejudice , and politically tendentious interpretations of law . <p> The widow of Alan Paton , the author of the renowned Cry , the Beloved Country ( 1948 ) and champion of black rule in South Africa , announced recently that she 's leaving the country because of its soaring crime rate . " Among my friends , and the friends of my friends , I know of nine people who have been murdered in the past four years , " she wrote in an article published in the London Sunday Times . Mrs. Paton has herself been hijacked at gunpoint and had armed marauders tie her up and ransack her house . Most recently , two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way into her home , one brandishing a hammer . " There is more racial tension in this country than I have ever known , " said Mrs. Paton , who wrote that she is glad her husband is not alive to witness this state of affairs . " He would have been so distressed to see what has happened to his beloved country . " In South Africa , more tears . <p> The annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit was held this year in Malaysia , hosted by anti-American crackpot Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad . Mahathir 's latest outrage is to have dismissed and imprisoned his talented deputy prime minister , Dr. Anwar Ibrahim , on trumped-up charges , including sodomy . But it 's not about sex : Anwar is a pro-Western free-market democrat whom many had touted as Mahathir 's successor . So it was right for Vice President Al Gore to make a plug for the human rights of Malaysians in his speech at Mahathir 's official dinner . Some diplomats clucked " inappropriate " -a word that , in a rare exception for the Clinton Administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heroics of the Albuquerque police department . By hiring physical trainers to help women pass physical tests , switching to smaller weapons that better fit women 's hands , and tailoring bulletproof vests to conform to women 's chests , the Albuquerque police department is 13 per cent female . A lot of other departments are n't so enlightened . The International Association of Chiefs of Police found that nearly 20 per cent of the 800 American police departments it surveyed have no women at all . Of the 17,000 police departments in the U.S. , only 123 have female chiefs . The reasons are straightforward : women are n't interested , fail to measure up , or , after a few years , decide they prefer staying at home with their kids . Still , the association urges more aggressive recruitment and the kind of special energy Albuquerque has devoted to keeping women in the ranks . ( The energy left over , one supposes , can be used to keep the streets safe . ) <p> Actress Meg Ryan , known for playing sweet and innocent women in such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Got Mail , graces the December issue of Harper 's Bazaar wearing a leather jacket and a fierce expression . Inside , she poses with her hands inside her jacket , or , alternatively , inside her pants , and rails against those who perceive her as sweet . In real life , she insists , she 's not like that at all . To prove it , she takes her clothes off , postures lewdly , and is rude to her interviewer , who proceeds to gush , " Real Meg is infinitely more interesting . " In the old days , screen sirens were quick to tell us they were virtuous in real life . Now Ryan is hoping that her new role in Hurlyburly-in which , Harper 's Bazaar reports , she has a cameo as " a druggy , well-meaning good-time girl who performs sex acts in front of her six-year-old daughter " - will rescue her from her good-girl reputation . Who says shame and stigma are dead ? <p> When not gazing at crystals , New Agers wax reverent about the advanced civilization of the Anasazi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pacifism and refined spirituality that mysteriously disappeared around 1150 A.D. Now comes bad news from The New Yorker : according to research by anthropologist Christy Turner , the Anasazi died out from a very bad case of cannibalism . Their society collapsed from the practice among dominant Anasazi of terrorizing underlings by routinely eating them . They probably wore fur , too . <p> A predominantly white Dartmouth fraternity held a closed party with a " ghetto " theme : invitees dressed like " hip-hop gangstas . " The event was tasteless , the reaction hysterical . At a community forum entitled " What Is Ghetto ? " English professor Bill Cook received a standing ovation for demanding college speech codes in response to the party , explaining that " free speech is the last refuge of scoundrels . " And the student government is researching a new curriculum requirement called IRE , for " Identity Race Ethnicity . " Finally-a core curriculum . <p> Speaking of gangsta rappers , here at 215 Lexington Avenue , NR 's immediate downstairs neighbors are the rap-music magazines Vibe and Blaze , whose editors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain rappers , or publishing photos the rappers did n't care to have published , the editors have in their own offices variously been grabbed , thrown to the ground , kicked from behind , and battered with chairs . One rapper pulled a 9-mm. pistol on the editor of Blaze . This , by the way , is why we do n't review rap albums . <p> Actor Tom Hanks , who gave $10,000 to President Clinton 's legal defense fund months ago , then told The New Yorker that it would be " awfully hard " for him to give another such gift , now says that he would want to give " twice as much . " That 's the trouble with real life : every take is a print . <p> AIDS tattoos are hip , reports Newsweek , with the HIV-positive stenciling themselves on the arm with " syringes entwined with serpents , the bio-hazard emblem , or an inch-high ' POZ .

It turns out he was a fashion trendsetter . <p> The President 's dog , Buddy , bit the hand of a Marine Corps helicopter pilot . The White House-seriously-blamed the hand . <p> ILLUSTRATION <p>
