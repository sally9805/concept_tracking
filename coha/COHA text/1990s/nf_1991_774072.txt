Combine the white wine , vinegar , and shallots as for the classic method , but reduce the infusion by three-quarters instead of by half . Add 1 ? cups ( 300 milliliters ) of full-bodied brown stock to the reduction , and simmer the mixture slowly for 20 minutes . Strain through a fine chinois . Yield : 1 cup ( 250 milliliters ) . Sauce Zingara There are two types of sauce zingara . Zingara A , based on a very acidic reduction of vinegar and shallots , is one of the few breadcrumb-thickened sauces that survive in the classic repertoire . ( Zingara B is based on white wine , and its recipe is in the section on white-wine-based derivative brown sauces , earlier in this chapter . ) Combine V2 cup ( 125 milliliters ) of white-wine vinegar with 1 tablespoon ( 15 grams ) of finely chopped shallots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by reducing by half . While the vinegar is reducing , gently cook 3 ounces ( 75 grams ) of breadcrumbs in 2 ounces ( 50 grams ) of butter . Cook the breadcrumbs until they begin to smell toasty , but do not let them brown . Add 3/4 cup ( 175 milliliters ) of brown chicken or beef stock to the vinegar reduction . and add the breadcrumbs . Simmer the sauce for 5 to 10 minutes . Finish the sauce with 1 tablespoon ( 15 grams ) of finely chopped parsley . ( Some recipes suggest finishing the sauce with lemon juice , but taste the sauce first : it is probably already acidic enough . ) Yield : 1 cup ( 250 milliliters ) . DERIVATIVE BROWN SAUCES WITHOUT WINE OR VINEGAR Most derivative brown sauces are prepared by infusing flavorful ingredients . such as mirepoix , shallots , ham , or onions , in wine or vinegar . For delicately flavored sauces , the acidity of wine and vinegar can be troublesome . This is especially true of sauces containing truffles or mushrooms . And sauces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorrel , do not usually benefit from the additional acid derived from wine and vinegar . Sauce Perigueux and Sauce Perigourdine Both of these sauces are traditionally prepared by adding truffle essence to demi-glace . The only difference between the two is that perigueux sauce is 181 finished with chopped truffles and perigourdine sauce is finished with truffles turned in miniature olive shapes or with whole truffle slices . If you are using whole truffles , it is certainly far more dramatic to slice them than it is to chop them . If you have a Japanese mandoline , a single truffle will supply fifty to sixty slices . Both of these sauces will benefit by finishing with truffle butter . Truffle essence is used in these sauces to reinforce the flavor of the truffles . If none is available , it can be replaced with a full-bodied brown stock . Classic Method . Bring 1 ? cups ( 350 milliliters ) of demi-glace or coulis to a slow simmer . Skim off any froth that rises to the surface . Add 3 fluid ounces ( 75 milliliters ) of truffle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chopped or sliced truffles . Remove the saucepan from the stove , and cover with a tightfitting lid , allowing the truffles to infuse into the sauce for at least 15 minutes . Yield : 2 cups ( 500 milliliters ) . Meat-Glace Method . Bring 3 fluid ounces ( 75 milliliters ) of appropriately flavored brown stock ( that is , beef stock for beef , duck stock for duck , and so forth ) to a slow simmer . Skim off any froth that rises to the top , and add 3 fluid ounces ( 75 milliliters ) of truffle essence and 3 tablespoons ( 45 milliliters ) of meat glace . As soon as the meat glace dissolves in the hot stock , whisk in 2 ounces ( 5 grams ) of butter or truffle butter , and add 2 ounces ( 50 grams ) of chopped or sliced truffles . Cover the saucepan , and put the sauce back on the stove just long enough for it to come to a simmer and give it sheen . Cover the sauce and remove the pan from direct heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truffles infuse for at least 10 minutes in the covered saucepan before serving . Yield : 1 cup ( 250 milliliters ) . Unthickened Method . A consomme-like version of sauce perigourdine looks striking when served on a deep white plate or wide bowl . The easiest way to prepare an unbound version is to simply infuse truffle slices in a deeply flavored beef or appropriately flavored clear brown stock for 10 minutes over low heat . Sauce aux Champignons ( Mushroom Sauce ) Mushroom sauce is simply a combination of reduced mushroom essence and demi-glace or meat glace and butter . Classic Method . Reduce 5 fluid ounces ( 150 milliliters ) of mushroom essence in half . Add 13/4 cups ( 400 milliliters ) of demi-glace to the reduction . Bring the mixture to a simmer , and skim off any froth that rises to the surface . 182 eauc ? e Strain through a fine chinois and whisk in 1 ounce ( 25 grams ) of butter . Finish with 2 ounces ( 50 grams ) of button mushrooms that have been simmered in a covered saucepan in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock . The cooking liquid from the mushrooms can be used to supply or augment the mushroom essence . Yield : 2 cups ( 500 milliliters ) . Meat-Glace Method . Add 4 tablespoons of meat glace to 5 fluid ounces ( 150 milliliters ) of mushroom essence . Gently simmer the mixture long enough for the meat glace to dissolve . Finish with 2 ounces ( 50 grams ) of butter and . 1 ounce ( 25 grams ) of cooked button mushrooms . Yield : 1 cup ( 250 milliliters ) . Unthickened Method . Full-flavored brown stock can be infused with mushrooms by bringing equal parts mushrooms and stock by weight to a simmer and letting the mixture infuse for 10 minutes in a covered pot . That is , use ? pound ( 250 grams ) of mushrooms per cup ( 250 milliliters ) of stock . Alternatives and Variations . This sauce can be used as a model for sauces based on a wide variety of wild mushrooms . The mushrooms are first cooked in a small amount of water or stock , which then becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reserved and then added at the end . Although the recipes above call for whole button mushrooms , leaving the mushrooms whole is impractical with large wild mushrooms such as Boletus edulus ( cepes ) . It is , of course , acceptable to slice or cube the mushrooms . The flavor of mushrooms can be made more assertive by first sauteing them in hot olive oil , goose fat , or butter until they brown . Some recipes call for sprinkling the mushrooms with chopped shallots , chopped garlic , or persillade . Sauce Italienne This sauce is almost identical to sauce duxelles except that , traditionally , sauce italienne contains ham . Classic Method . Add 3 fluid ounces ( 75 milliliters ) of tomato puree to 1 ? cups ( 350 milliliters ) of demi-glace . Simmer the sauce gently for 10 minutes . Skim off any scum or froth that floats to the surface . Add 2 tablespoons ( 30 grams ) of duxelles and 2 ounces ( 50 grams ) of ham cut into small cubes ( brunoise ) . Finish the sauce with 1 teaspoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and tarragon . Yield : 2 cups ( 500 milliliters ) . Meat-Glace Method . Combine 5 fluid ounces ( 150 milliliters ) of brown chicken or beef stock with 1/4 cup ( 50 milliliters ) of tomato puree . Dissolve -i 93n.oAZn. &ucae,; 18 3 tablespoons ( 60 milliliters ) of meat glace into the mixture . Finish the sauce with 1 tablespoon ( 15 grams ) duxelles , 1 ounce ( 25 grams ) of ham cut into cubes , 1 ounce ( 25 grams ) of butter , and 1 teaspoon ( 5 grams ) each of chopped parsley , chervil , and tarragon . Yield : 1 ? cups ( 350 milliliters ) . Unthickened Method . Sauce italienne can be reinterpreted by finishing a full-flavored brown stock with cubes of fresh tomatoes , a mushroom julienne or tiny chanterelles , and the cubes of ham and herbs called for in the classic sauce . DIPS ON IMPROVING THE FLAVOR OF BROWN SAUCES USING MEAT TRIMMINGS Restaurant cooks often develop the habit of tossing meat trimmings indiscriminately into the always simmering stockpot . If the fat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stock , but much of their flavor will be lost after the long simmering and reduction that stock often undergoes . In a well-organized kitchen , these meat trimmings can be put to better use . A brown sauce will always be improved if meat is sweated and caramelized along with the aromatic vegetables used to prepare the flavor base . Early French recipes almost invariably called for lining the bottom of the pot with a slice of ham or veal as a preliminary step in sauce preparation . Cured , unsmoked ham will also contribute enormously to the flavor and complexity of a sauce . Cut the ham into cubes and sweat it along with the aromatic vegetables used to make the flavor base . SUCCESSIVE CARAMELIZATION The majority of classic brown sauce recipes combine raw or gently sweated aromatic vegetables with wine or stock before adding demi-glace . The flavor of these sauces can be greatly improved if the aromatic vegetables are cooked long enough with meat trimmings or ham so that their juices fall to the bottom of the saucepan and lightly caramelize . This process can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and reducing the liquid until it forms a glace and caramelizes a second or third time on the bottom of the pot . When the vegetables and meats used for the sauce base have been caramelized in this way , they are then ready for the final moistening with coulis , demi-glace , // or stock . After the final moistening , the glazed vegetables and meat trimmings should not be simmered for more than forty-five minutes , or the deep , meaty flavor brought out by successive caramelization will be lost . In classic French sauce making , this technique is called faire tomber a glace ? literally , " to cause to fall to a glace . " This procedure is time consuming , because the pot has to be closely watched so the juices do not overreduce and burn , but the technique will give a fresh jus-like character to the sauce . INCREASING ACIDITY Long-simmered brown sauces , even when carefully prepared with the best ingredients , often taste flat . This is usually because during the long reduction , the volatile flavor components in the meats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A small amount of good-quality wine vinegar ( anywhere from a few drops to a few teaspoons per cup of sauce ) added to the sauce near the end will awaken the flavor . REDUCING ACIDITY Even experienced professional chefs are perplexed about correcting a sauce that has become too acidic as a result of using a poorly chosen wine for cooking or because of the reduction of acidic ingredients such as tomatoes . The obvious solution is to add sugar . Some sauces , such as long-simmered tomato sauces , benefit from a little sugar , which when used carefully will compensate for the lack of natural sugar that would have been present if the tomatoes were ripe . In brown sauces sugar rarely melds successfully with the other flavors and often tastes out of place even when used discreetly . For this reason , chefs usually prefer to introduce sweetness into a sauce by adding a small amount of fortified wine such as port or Madeira . Although sweetness seems the obvious counterbalance to excess acidity in a sauce , there are instances where a particular kind of tartness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although it sounds like a contradiction , a sauce 's tartness is often softened and brought into perspective by adding vinegar . The best method for dealing with stubborn , excess acidity is to work with the sauce before the addition of butter so that , if necessary , its consistency can be adjusted by reduction . Add a small amount of port , and reduce the sauce slightly to evaporate the alcohol . Keep doing this bit by bit until the sweetness begins to be barely perceptible . Then add a small amount of wine vinegar ? 85 just enough so that you can no longer taste the sweetness of the port . Add a bit more port , then a bit more vinegar . Keep repeating this process , going back and forth between port and vinegar until the sauce 's acidity is in balance with the other flavors . ADDING COGNAC , ARMAGNAC , OR KIRSCH A teaspoon or two of Cognac or Armagnac added to a cup of sauce at the very end of cooking will give complexity and depth to a sauce 's flavor . Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it should be held at a simmer for ten to fifteen seconds to evaporate the alcohol . Kirsch is particularly useful for bringing out the natural fruitiness of redwine-and fortified-wine-based sauces . Use only a few drops at a time , tasting all the while . Be careful in your choice of Kirsch ( see chapter 3 , " Ingredients " ) . USING GASTRIC The use of gastric has traditionally been limited to specific sweet-and-sour sauces , which nowadays are most often served with duck . The delicate balance of bitterness , tartness , and sweetness that are characteristic of a carefully prepared gastric will often enhance a variety of other brown sauces as well . FINISHING WITH FRESH HERBS As noted previously , sauces that have been greatly reduced or cooked for long periods will often end up tasting flat . A small bouquet garni containing a sprig of thyme , a piece of bay leaf , and a small bunch of parsley can be simmered with the reduced stock for about an hour before the stock is strained and added to the sauce 's flavor base . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's flavor . A quick way of refreshing the flavor of almost any sauce is to finish the sauce with freshly chopped parsley , chervil , or chives . None of these herbs will overpower the sauce , either when used alone or in a fines herbes mixture without tarragon . IMPROVISING BROWN SAUCES When preparing a classic French sauce , the skillful saucier constantly adjusts the sauce 's flavor , consistency , and color . Several brown sauce methods have 186 Sauces been presented in this chapter , including classic demi-glace , natural coulis , meat glace , and unbound versions . Experienced sauciers rarely adhere to one method alone when constructing a sauce and will usually prepare a sauce using a combination of methods , sometimes inventing and improvising as they go along . As an example , consider a sauce hussarde . The flavor base is prepared by gently sweating onions and shallots in butter and then adding white wine , which is reduced by half . If , at this point , the chef has on hand a full-flavored brown stock but no demi-glace , he or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ensure that the sauce quickly develops a lightly thick ened consistency . If the chef wants to avoid flour , and if time and budget Brown Sauces 18 7 permit , he or she may decide to reduce the brown stock until it has the consistency of a natural coulis . Or he or she might decide , after adding the stock , to thicken the sauce with a little cornstarch or arrowroot , combined first with cold water . If demi-glace is on hand , the chef may decide to combine techniques and use demi-glace along with a full-flavored brown stock or jus and then adjust the consistency of the sauce with meat glace . He or she may then decide to finish the sauce with butter or cream . Or the chef may decide to keep the sauce unbound except for a small amount of butter added at the end . The saucier 's ability to shift among techniques and methods allows the creation of the best possible sauce , given the limits of time , cost , and clientele . When the chef wants to design a sauce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the purpose of the sauce is to concentrate and extend the natural flavors of the meat or if the sauce is to function like a condiment or accent . If the sauce 's role is to concentrate or extend the inherent flavors of the meat , the chef should combine classic brown sauce techniques with integral sauce methods ( see chapter 9 , " Integral Meat Sauces " ) and should take care that flavor elements used to finish the sauce do not mask the meat 's natural flavors . If , however , the primary function of the sauce is to accent and juxtapose with the flavors of the meat , then all that the saucier needs to consider is how the sauce will be presented ( which will help decide its texture ) and what its flavor will be . As the sauce hussarde example illustrates , a sauce 's consistency can be manipulated by shifting among several techniques . Whereas the methods for constructing a sauce can be categorized and illustrated using classic French sauces as examples , the final choice of how to flavor a sauce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and an almost infinite variety of circumstances . The ethnic or regional character of the food will usually provide a set of ingredients for the saucier to use as a source of flavor ideas . For example , in a restaurant serving Mexican food , the chief may decide to use a puree of tomatillos instead of tomato puree , or to sweat garlic and hot peppers instead of shallots for the flavor base . Instead of using parsley and chervil to finish the sauce , he may choose cilantro . In a restaurant serving Thai food , the saucier might replace the vinegar called for in a flavor base with an infusion of lemon grass and then finish the sauce with coconut milk instead of butter . Sometimes the chef will want to design a sauce around a special ingredient , perhaps a newly found , locally grown herb , a basket of fresh morels , or a particularly fat and stinky truffle . The emphasis is then on how best to extract 18 8 &u.c.eo.; and concentrate the ingredient 's individual flavor . In a sense the meat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their potential for subtlety , brown sauces are usually enhanced when served with wine . At times a chef will need to design sauces around a menu highlighting a special bottle or type of wine . This task is often very difficult . Many chefs mistakenly assume that the sauce should share as many flavors with the wine as possible , whereas in fact a wine 's nuances are better showcased when they contrast gently with but are not overpowered by the flavors of food . Considering the origin of the wine will be helpful in deciding on appropriate flavors for the sauce . EBzQ , , zn , &cu,A; 18 9 JIPS FOR THE RESTAURANT CHEF Brown sauces were originally designed to streamline the organization of professional kitchens . A modern kitchen , where stocks and glaces are made as part of the daily routine , will always have on hand the necessary bases for preparing classic and improvised sauces . Because the sauce bases are prepared in advance , the cooks are freed from last-minute reductions and can put together complicated , time-consuming sauces in a matter of minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the professional kitchen are obvious . Unfortunately , the long-simmered stocks and glaces of the classic French kitchen can sometimes detract from the character and individuality of different types of dishes . It is perhaps for this reason that home-cooked meals are often satisfying in a way that restaurant meals are not . Consequently , many contemporary chefs have at least partially abandoned many of the traditional techniques used in classic sauce making and kitchen organization and are instead preparing integral sauces to order , keeping little in reserve beyond some freshly made stocks . Some restaurants may use only chicken stock as an all-purpose moistening and deglazing liquid for made-to-order sauces . It can be prepared in various versions ? reduced , as a twice-moistened jus , and so on . Preparing meat glace is time consuming , but once the glace is finished , it is easy to store and always useful for last minute sauces . Coulis , even the alternative version described at the beginning of this chapter , is expensive and time consuming to make , but any restaurant willing to invest in it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FISH SAUCES he best fish sauces are integral sauces prepared using the methods in chapter 10 , where a sauce is made at the same time or immediately after the fish is cooked . In many restaurant settings or catering situations , however , it is impractical to prepare a sauce at the last minute , so the chef will prepare a sauce in advance using fish stock . Over the centuries chefs have designed sauce-making methods to deal with the constraints imposed in situations where limited personnel are available to prepare dishes for a large number of people . In these settings a batch of sauce is prepared in advance and ladled out over or around the cooked fish as it is needed . In classic French cooking , fish sauces are usually designed to capture the flavor of the fish itself . The development of fish stock was the natural outcome of preparing integral-like sauces in advance . In one sense stock-based sauces for fish are integral sauces made ahead of time with fish heads and bones . For hundreds of years , and until the last two or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the majority of stock-based fish sauces . Fish veloute is fish stock thickened with roux . It is then flavored with a variety of infusions , herbs , compound butters , cream , and wines , to produce the whole range of classic derivative fish sauces . Starting in the 1950s and 1960s , roux-thickened sauces were gradually eliminated , the idea being that flour makes a sauce needlessly rich and detracts from its finesse and clear flavor . ( Actually the sauces that replaced the old 190 efocC , - g.ae.ea a , n.d , O Sat , a.icae , 1 9I flour-thickened sauces are far richer . ) Traditional fish veloute was replaced with sauces based on reduced fish stock ( fish glace , or glace de poisson ) and reduced cream , butter , or a combination of both . Egg-yolk-thickened hollandaise-type sauces containing reduced fish stock , sabayon sauces , sauces thickened with vegetable purees , and allemande-type sauces ( thickened with egg yolk like a creme anglaise but containing no flour ) are other attempts to eliminate flour from the kitchen . Most of the sauce-making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ techniques were designed to duplicate the thick consistency of the classic sauces . For this reason , many of these sauces can be extremely heavy and rich ? most of the cream and butter is used , not to improve the flavor of the sauce , but to give it a supposedly appropriate texture and consistency . Today many of the butter- and cream-thickened sauces popular in the sixties and seventies have given way to lighter , brothlike versions . These light but intensely flavored sauces were made possible by two innovations in the dining room : deep plates with rims ( assiettes creuses ) , which will hold a sauce almost like a soup , and the sauce spoon ( cuillere a sauce ) , which enables the diner to sip the sauce without having to rely on the sauce clinging to the fish to get it from plate to mouth . Instead of serving the fish coated with a sauce , it is surrounded with the sauce , like a fish stew or even soup . CLASSIC FRENCH FISH SAUCES Although today 's chefs have abandoned many of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combinations . Most of these sauces begin with an infusion of flavor components , such as white wine , shallots , various herbs , and mushroom essence . Fish veloute is then added to the infusion , and the sauce is then enriched with any number of elements , such as egg yolks , cream , butter , compound butters , and crustacean butters . In flourless versions of these classics , the fish veloute is replaced with a much smaller quantity of fish glace ; the sauce is then finished with many of the same enrichening ingredients as the original versions . Contemporary broth-textured versions of classic fish sauces use a small amount of freshly prepared fish stock or may even replace the fish stock with a light vegetable stock ( court-bouillon ) . At no point is the fish stock ( if it is used ) or the finished sauce reduced , the feeling being that reduced fish stock and fish sauces develop a strong , flat , fishy flavor . Contemporary fish sauces often include acidic elements , such as vinegar , lemon or lime juice , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flavor than their classic counter-parts . Contemporary sauces and contemporary interpretations of classic sauces need to be more intensely flavored than the traditional versions because in most cases less of the sauce is served : 2 to 3 tablespoons ( 30 to 50 milliliters ) is typical . Bring the fish stock to a simmer in a 2-quart saucepan . Skim off any froth that floats to the surface . Prepare a white roux with the butter and flour ; cook it in a heavy-bottomed 2-quart saucepan over low heat for 5 to 10 minutes . Remove the roux from the heat , and pour in the simmering fish stock . Whisk the mixture to dissolve the roux . Place the mixture on top of the stove , and allow it to come to a slow simmer . Make sure that the saucepan is placed slightly to one side of the flame ; this encourages a film to form to one side of the sauce , where it can be more easily skimmed . Skim the veloute for approximately 30 minutes until it has reduced down to 1 quart ( 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the veloute while it is cooling to prevent a skin from forming on its surface . SAUCE NORMANDE Sauce normande is one of the most important of the classic fish sauces because it is relatively neutral but full flavored , making it good in itself as well as adaptable to variation . The classic version uses mussel cooking liquid , but other shellfish cooking liquids , such as those from clams or cockles , can be used with excellent results . // Because sauce normande contains so many of the elements of modern fish sauces , it is useful to examine the sauce in detail , with an eye to possible variations and modifications . CLASSIC SAUCE NORMANDE A classic sauce normande is based on fish veloute to which mushroom cooking liquid , mussel cooking liquid , and additional fish stock are added , giving the sauce deeper flavor and a more complex character . The sauce is then finished with heavy cream ( in the manner of a sauce supreme ) , lemon juice , and egg yolks ( in the manner of a sauce allemande ) . The sauce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flour contained in the veloute stabilizes the egg yolks ? flourless sauces containing egg yolks will curdle if allowed to boil . ) A final liaison of butter is added at the very end . 1 . Combine the fish veloute , mushroom cooking liquid , mussel cooking liquid , and freshly made fish stock in a 2-quart saucepan , and bring the mixture to a simmer . 2 . Whisk the egg yolks with 1 cup ( 250 milliliters ) of the heavy cream and the lemon juice . Pour about 1 cup ( 250 milliliters ) of the hot fish liquids into the egg yolk/cream mixture . Whisk the sauce , and return it to the saucepan . 3 . Reduce the sauce by about one-third over high heat . 4 . Strain the sauce through a fine chinois , and finish it with the butter and the remaining cream . Adjust the seasoning , and add more lemon juice if necessary . 196 &ucea,; CONTEMPORARY VARIATIONS OF SAUCE NORMANDE Although classic sauce normande is rarely prepared in restaurants today , many contemporary fish sauces contain similar elements . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does a modern sauce contain three rich liaisons ? cream , butter , and egg yolks . Some contemporary normande-style sauces contain only a few of the flavor elements of a traditional sauce normande . Mussel or clam cooking liquid finished with a small amount of heavy cream is in itself an excellent sauce , as is mushroom cooking liquid , especially if made with morels or other wild mushrooms . When preparing a contemporary sauce normande , it is important to decide how the completed dish will be presented . If a thick sauce is needed to coat the fish or the fish fillets , the basic flavor elements ( fish stock , mussel cooking liquid , and mushroom cooking liquid ) will have to be reduced until they are almost dry , and a relatively large amount of cream , butter , egg yolks , or some combination will be required to give the sauce the necessary consistency . When cream is added , the sauce is reduced again and is sometimes finished with butter . A fish sauce made in this way will have a smoother , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extremely rich because its consistency is derived almost entirely from fats . A less dense sauce will require far less cream or butter and very little , if any , reduction . CREAM-BASED SAUCE NORMANDE The cream-based model for sauce normande is analogous to the contemporary sauce supreme described in chapter 6 , " White Sauces for Meat and Vegetables . " etoc.fc-giae.e.d. a.nct 0-tanin . eraf J'J aea.cee , 197 1 . Combine the fish stock , mushroom cooking liquid , and mussel or clam cooking liquid in a 4-quart saucepan , and reduce them until only 1 cup ( 250 milliliters ) remains . ( Be careful to not let the flames from the stove wrap around the sides of the saucepan , or the insides of the saucepan will turn dark brown and will discolor the sauce when the cream is added. ) 2 . Add the cream to the reduction , and boil it over medium heat while whisking until the sauce has the desired consistency . 3 . Swirl in the butter , and adjust the seasoning . ( Salt is rarely needed because of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BUTTER-BASED SAUCE NORMANDE In this sauce model , the flavor elements are reduced in the same way as for the reduced-cream version , until they are almost dry . The reduction is then converted into a sauce by whisking in a large amount of butter . The sauce is analogous to a beurre blanc , where reduced fish stock , mushroom cooking liquid , and mussel or clam cooking liquid replace the white wine/shallot reduction . Combine the fish stock , the mussel or clam cooking liquid , and the mushroom cooking liquid in a 4-quart saucepan , and reduce them until only 1 cup ( 250 milliliters ) remains . Add the heavy cream , and reduce until the mixture thickens slightly . Cut the butter into large cubes . Add one-fourth of the butter to the hot reduc-tion . Whisk rapidly over medium to high heat until the butter dissolves , add another fourth of the butter , whisk ; continue in this way until all the butter has been added . Adjust the seasoning . // EGG-YOLK-BASED SAUCE NORMANDE Egg-yolk-thickened fish sauces can be approached in two ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a creme anglaise , is cooked gently over the stove until it thickens . It is never allowed to boil . Sauces thickened in this way have the advantage over cream- and butter-thickened sauces of not requiring reduction of the fish stock and mussel or clam cooking liquid . Consequently they retain more of their vitality and freshness . The thickness of the sauce can be adjusted by varying the number of egg yolks used , from eight to sixteen yolks per quart ( liter ) of liquid . Most egg-yolk-thickened sauces are finished with butter ( about one-tenth by volume ) . Remember , when using egg yolks , to avoid cooking them in aluminum pots . The second method of thickening with egg yolks involves reducing the flavor elements , whisking them with egg yolks to form a sabayon , and then finishing the sauce with varying amounts of whole or clarified butter , in the style of a sauce hollandaise or sabayon . This method is used for a traditional sauce vin blanc ( see the recipe later in this chapter ) . Combine the fish stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and heavy cream in a 4 , quart saucepan . Bring the mixture to a simmer . Whisk the egg yolks until they are smooth and slightly pale . Whisk half of the simmering fish liquid into the egg yolks . Remove the remain-ing fish liquid from the heat . Whisk the egg yolk mixture into the hot fish liquid . Stir the sauce with a wooden spatula or spoon over low to medium heat until it thickens ( a line drawn along the back of the spoon or spatula will remain ) . Remove the sauce from the heat , and continue to stir for a minute or two to cook it slightly and prevent the egg yolks from curdling .

Combining Methods Each of the methods for flavoring and thickening fish sauces has certain disad-vantages . Cream and butter sauces are rich and expensive to prepare , egg-yolk-thickened sauces sometimes have an eggy taste or a chalky texture , and flour-thickened sauces often taste starchy . Preparing a successful fish sauce sometimes requires using several tech-niques . One method is to prepare a very light , classic veloute with one-quarter as much roux as the classic recipe calls for , carefully reducing the veloute by half ( skimming carefully and removing any skin that forms on its surface ) , and then finishing this lightly prethickened base with cream , butter , egg yolks , or a combination of the three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the classic fish sauces are based on either fish veloute or sauce nor-mande . Most of these variations are prepared by making an infusion of basic flavors , adding fish veloute or sauce normande as a sauce base and thickener , sometimes reducing the mixture ( unless a flourless egg-yolk-thickened version 200 ei 1 . ucee , is used ) , and then enriching it with cream , butter , or both . The sauces are usually finished with additional flavorings , such as tomatoes , anchovy butter . herbs , crustacean butter , and the like . Sauce Anchois ( Anchovy Sauce ) Sauce anchois is prepared by adding anchovy butter ( see chapter 15 , " Butter Sauces " ) to sauce normande and then finishing the sauce with diced anchovy fillets . The anchovy butter should be added to taste , but the usual parameter is one part anchovy butter to nine parts sauce normande and one-half part diced anchovies . If available , use anchovies packed in salt , rather than canned anchovies : salted anchovies have a better flavor , and it is easier to remove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold water . Remove the two fillets from the backbone , and dry them on paper towels . If using canned anchovies , soak the fillets for five minutes in cold water , and then pat them dry on paper towels to remove excess salt and oil . Sauce Aurore for Fish Sauce aurore is usually known as a white sauce for meats , preparing by adding tomato puree to a sauce veloute ( see chapter 6 , " White Sauces for Meats and Vegetables " ) . A version for fish can be prepared by adding tomato puree to a traditional fish veloute or to any of the versions of sauce normande . A traditional sauce aurore for fish is made by adding one part tomato puree to three parts fish veloute , reducing if necessary , and then finishing the sauce with butter ( one part butter to nine parts sauce ) . Flourless variations of sauce aurore can be prepared by adding tomato puree in the same proportions to the egg-yolk- and cream- or butter-based sauces described above . When ripe summer tomatoes are available , they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and added to the aurore without straining . Sauce Bercy This version of sauce Bercy contains similar ingredients to the integral version described in chapter 10 , but is based on fish veloute and made ahead of time . To prepare the traditional version add 1 cup ( 250 milliliters ) of white wine and 1 cup ( 250 milliliters ) of fish stock to 2 chopped shallots that have been sweated in butter . Reduce the mixture to 1 ? cups ( 375 milliliters ) . Add 3 cups ( 750 milliliters ) of fish veloute ; finish the sauce with 4 ounces ( 125 grams ) of butter and 1 tablespoon ( 15 grams ) of chopped parsley , whisked in off the heat . Yield : 1 quart ( 1 liter ) .

It is in some ways a precursor of contemporary sauces because of its use of court-bouillon . Many contemporary chefs replace fish stock entirely with court-bouillon . Add 1 ounce ( 30 grams ) of mushroom trimmings to 1 ? cups ( 350 milliliters ) of court-bouillon . Reduce the mixture until 1/2 cup ( 125 milliliters ) remains . To prepare the traditional version , add 3 cups ( 750 milliliters ) of fish veloute , and finish with 5 ounces ( 150 grams ) of butter ; season with cayenne pepper . Yield : 1 quart ( 1 liter ) . Flourless versions of this sauce can be prepared by thickening the reduction with cream , butter , or egg yolks using the same proportions as the models presented above .

Yield : 1 quart ( 1 liter ) . HOLLANDAISE-STYLE FISH SAUCES Classic white-wine fish sauce is prepared using one of two methods , both of which use egg yolks . The first method is based on a sabayon prepared with reduced fish stock and egg yolks , which is then finished with butter in the same way as a sauce hollandaise . The second method consists of finishing fish veloute with egg yolks and butter as in preparing a sauce allemande . Hollandaise Method . Reduce 1 cup ( 250 milliliters ) of fish stock ( which includes the white wine ) by two-thirds . Let the reduction cool , and combine it with 5 egg yolks . Whisk the mixture over the heat until it becomes airy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same way as preparing sauce hollandaise . Classic recipes call for almost 4 ounces ( 125 grams ) of butter per egg yolk , but the sauce can be made lighter by using half as much . Yield : 2 to 3 ? cups ( 500 to 875 milliliters ) , depending on the amount of butter used . Allemande Method . Finish 3 cups ( 750 milliliters ) of fish veloute with 4 egg yolks and 4 ounces ( 125 grams ) of butter , or prepare a flourless version by finishing 3 cups ( 750 milliliters ) of fish stock with 8 egg yolks and 4 ounces ( 125 grams ) of butter . The sauce should first be thickened with the egg yolks , with the butter whisked in at the end . Remember , if preparing a flourless version , do not let the sauce boil .

A court-bouillon is prepared with a julienne of vegetables ; the julienne is then reserved to garnish the fish while the courtbouillon is bound with a sauce vin blanc ( hollandaise method ) made in advance . Julienne 1 medium carrot , 1 medium celeriac , and 1 leek . Sweat the julienne for 10 minutes in butter , and then pour in 1 cup ( 250 milliliters ) of water or fish stock . Simmer slowly until the vegetables are cooked . Strain out the vegetables and save them to garnish the fish .

Thicken the liquid by whisking in enough sauce vin blanc ( hollandaise method ) to achieve the desired consistency . Yield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , depending on the amount of sauce vin blanc used . FISH SAUCES FLAVORED WITH CRUSTACEAN AND CORAL BUTTERS Crustacean butters are often used to finish fish sauces to give them additional complexity and an appealing red or orange hue . Many of the classic fish sauces that are finished with crustacean butter have a similar taste because it is hard &act; - ga.aeL caul . G ax " ' " , tRcyt.aE 6nAUee , 203 to distinguish among the different crustacean butters . To capture the full complexity of a crustacean 's flavor , it is essential to start with the whole living animal ( see chapter 11 , " Crustacean Sauces " ) . The sauces listed below should be thought of as fish sauces nuanced with crustacean butters rather than fullflavored crustacean sauces , which can be found in chapter 11 . Sauce Bavaroise ( Bavarian Sauce ) Combine 1 cup ( 250 milliliters ) of white-wine vinegar , 1 bay leaf , 1 sprig of thyme , 1 sprig of parsley , 5 black peppercorns , and 1 tablespoon ( 15 grams ) of grated horseradish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 egg yolks , whisk it over heat until it becomes thick and airy , and then add 1 cup ( 250 milliliters ) of clarified butter . ( Clarified butter is essential to make the sauce thick because the sabayon is very light . ) Strain the sauce , and finish it with 2 ounces ( 50 grams ) of crayfish butter and 2 tablespoons ( 30 milliliters ) of whipped cream . The sauce can also be finished with crayfish tails cut into cubes . Yield : 2 cups ( 500 milliliters ) . Sauce Crevettes ( Shrimp Sauce ) This sauce is prepared by finishing fish veloute or sauce bechamel with two types of crustacean butters : the bright red crustacean butter made with crustacean shells , and shrimp butter made with whole shrimp . Both of these butters are described in chapter 11 , " Crustacean Sauces . " Either traditional fish veloute or flourless versions can be used for the sauce base . If using traditional fish veloute , add 1/z cup ( 125 milliliters ) of heavy cream to 2 cups ( 500 milliliters ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tablespoon ( 15 grams ) of red crustacean butter and 3 tablespoons ( 45 grams ) of shrimp butter into 2 cups ( 500 milliliters ) of fish veloute . Strain through a fine chinois . Sprinkle in a small amount of cayenne pepper , and adjust the seasonings . The sauce can be garnished with cooked shrimp cut into cubes . Yield : 2 cups ( 500 milliliters ) . Sauce Diplomate Add 3 tablespoons ( 50 grams ) of lobster butter to 2 cups ( 500 milliliters ) of sauce normande . Finish the sauce with 1 tablespoon ( 15 grams ) of cubed truffles and 1 tablespoon ( 15 grams ) of cubed lobster tail . Yield : 2 cups ( 500 milliliters ) . Sauce Homard ( Lobster Sauce ) This sauce is identical to a sauce crevettes except that the shrimp butter is replaced with lobster butter . Yield : 2 cups ( 500 milliliters ) .

Yield : 2 cups ( 500 milliliters ) . SEA URCHIN SAUCE Sea urchin butter ( equal parts roe and butter ) can be used to give a delicate , sea-like flavor to a variety of sauce bases , or the sea urchin roe can be left in chunks and gently infused alone into the sauce base . The sauce given below combines the roe with egg yolks and cream and has a very light , souplike consistency . If a thicker sauce is needed , the shellfish cooking liquid should be reduced with half the cream before the egg yolk/roe mixture is incorporated . Sea urchin sauces are best served with delicate fish dishes such as poached sole , turbot , or other flat fish . Bring the court-bouillon , shellfish cooking liquid , and half the heavy cream to a simmer in a 2-quart saucepan . Remove the roe from the sea urchins and work it through a fine-mesh drum sieve . Combine the strained roe with the egg yolks and the remaining cream .

Finish the sauce with the chopped chives ( or other herbs ) . eJtacic- &.aeed,; cu-Lt 205 Sauces Using Scallop Roe Because most American scallops are marketed without the roe , there is little opportunity to use it in sauce making . If fresh scallops with the roe are available , the roe can be removed and incorporated into a sauce . The most direct method is to puree the roe in a food processor , strain it through a drum sieve , and combine it with butter , heavy cream , or egg yolks ( as for the sea urchin sauce above ) before using it to finish a fish sauce base . Sea scallop roe can also be poached for two to three minutes before it is pureed and then used to flavor a compound or whipped butter to be served with grilled or sauteed scallops or other seafood . RED-WINE FISH SAUCES Red-wine sauces are excellent when served with full-flavored fish such as salmon , fresh mackerel , squid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using salmon bones for making fish stock because of their strong , sometimes aggressive flavor . Red-wine sauces are an exception ; a sauce made with full-bodied red wine and salmon bones makes an assertive yet complex and subtle sauce . The recipe below can also be prepared with squid . Replace the salmon bones with 2 pounds ( 1 kilogram ) of fresh squid that has been cleaned , well rinsed , and finely sliced . Red-wine fish sauces prepared in this way are similar to the classic sauce genevoise , which was made with reduced fish stock bound with roux ( sauce espagnole maigre ) and finished with anchovy butter . 206 5cLUCea , RED-WINE SAUCE FOR SALMON Remove the gills from the base of the salmon head , and chop the head and the spine into 2-inch sections .

Finish the sauce by adding 2 to 4 tablespoons ( 30 to 60 grams ) of capers , pitted black olives , or both . Although traditional recipes do not suggest it , raito can also be finished with black-olive puree . CONTEMPORARY FISH SAUCES Today the best restaurants prepare either integral fish sauces or lightened versions that contain only a small amount of cream and butter ? or even none at all . Although many of the ingredients and techniques called for in classic French fish sauces are still used by chefs , roux , large amounts of cream and butter , and even fish stock are giving way to more contemporary methods . Contemporary fish sauces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fish stock and fish glace have largely been replaced by court-bouillon or the cooking liquid from bivalves such as mussels , clams , or cockles . Many chefs feel that fish stock and especially fish glace is too aggressive and fishy tasting . 2 . The consistency of fish sauces is often much thinner than in the past . Contemporary sauces often have a consistency similar to unreduced heavy cream . 3 . Much less sauce is given per serving . Today , a small amount of fish sauce is often served around the fish . Two to three tablespoons ( thirty to fifty milliliters ) of sauce per serving is typical . 4 . Vegetable purees such as tomato concassee , sorrel puree , and mushroom puree often constitute both the base and liaison of the sauce . 208 eat c ? i 5 . Sauces are more direct and intensely flavored than in the past . Because much less sauce is used , an intensely flavored sauce will not overwhelm the fish . 6 . Acidic ingredients , such as lime juice , lemon juice , assorted vinegars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher proportions . 7 . Court-bouillon is no longer prepared using a single standard set of ingredients . Chefs are eager to emphasize the character of specific vegetables , such as fennel or leeks , and will often prepare a courtbouillon with only one or two ingredients . Some chefs are even experimenting with vegetable juices as sauce bases and flavorings. 8 . Vinaigrette-like emulsions of oils and acidic ingredients are often used . 9 . Combinations of already prepared sauces such as beurre blanc , hollandaise-type sauces , vinaigrettes , and vegetable purees are often used . When butter is added to these sauces , it is usually whisked into an emulsion with water or a small amount of court-bouillon ( see chapter 15 , " Butter Sauces : Beurre Fondu " ) and then spooned or ladled into the sauce rather than being whisked into the sauce while cold . 10 . Spices are more widely used . Chefs are looking toward the cooking of India and the Far East as well as the European cooking of the Middle Ages to devise new flavor combinations .

It is acidulated with vinaigrette ( see chapter 16 , " Salad Sauces , Vinaigrettes , Salsas , and Relishes " ) and flavored at the end with chives . The flavor of the sauce can be varied by modifying the court-bouillon and the components in the vinaigrette . The chives may be replaced or augmented with other herbs or spices . Because vinaigrette is unstable , the court-bouillon , emulsified butter , and the vinaigrette itself should be combined at the last minute . The flavor of the sauce will vary depending on the ingredients used in the vinaigrette. ctoc - &aw.e.d; c rul , 9 o ti , rtteccicat ' S 6aucee , 209 In a 2-quart saucepan , reduce the court-bouillon to 3 fluid ounces ( 75 milli-liters ) .

Remove the reduced court-bouillon from the stove , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the chives . Adjust the seasonings . It may also be necessary to adjust the flavor by adding more vinaigrette . CORIANDER-SCENTED CLAM SAUCE This sauce is closer to a broth than a traditional sauce in consistency . The basic flavors ? clam cooking liquid and mushrooms ? give the sauce much of the same character as a classic sauce normande , but the fennel and the coriander give it an exciting , nervous complexity . To crush the coriander seeds , a small coffee grinder works well . Or use a mortar and pestle or a saucepan on a cutting board .

Strain through a fine chinois . Add the chopped fennel leaves . Adjust the seasonings . The sauce can be reduced slightly if necessary , but it should remain light textured and delicately flavored . TOMATO-BASED VINAIGRETTE/HOLLANDAISE SAUCE FOR FISH In classic French cooking , a tomato sauce for fish would be based on fish veloute which would then be flavored with tomato puree ( see sauce aurore for fish , earlier in the chapter ) . In the sauce described below , the tomato puree etac - i QA ed arid , 01 ini , erae 5  --  d , &A.,; 211 becomes the base of the sauce by contributing not only flavor but body . It also functions as an emulsifier for the vinegar and oil . This sauce could also be described as an elaborate vinaigrette finished with sauce hollandaise . This sauce can be modified by using different vegetable purees as the base , by altering the ingredients in the court-bouillon ( or replacing the courtbouillon with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ butter sauces other than hollandaise ( sauces finished with crustacean and coral butters work well ) . Reduce the court-bouillon to 1/2 cup ( 125 milliliters ) . Whisk together the tomato coulis , mustard , and vinegar . Whisk the olive oil into the tomato mixture as though preparing a vinaigrette . Just before serving , whisk the hot , reduced court-bouillon into the coulis-based vinaigrette . Whisk the vinaigrette into the sauce hollandaise . Adjust the seasonings . SMOKED SALMON AND SHRIMP SAUCE Smoked salmon can be used to flavor fish sauce in the same way that ham is used along with mirepoix to prepare red-wine sauces for meats . The rich , smoky flavor of the smoked salmon is best accented with hot peppers or hot pepper sauce ( such as Tabasco ) , which give it a welcome spiciness . This sauce uses shrimp shells to give it an extra dimension of flavor , but the sauce can be prepared without them . The thickness of the sauce can be adjusted by reducing the cream in varying amounts . The sauce is best served with full-flavored fish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrimp shells in the butter for about 10 minutes , until they turn pale orange . Add the court-bouillon or fish stock , the tomatoes or puree , and the tarragon sprig to the shrimp shells . Simmer the mixture for 15 minutes , and strain it into a second saucepan . Cut the smoked salmon into thin strips about 1 inch long . Add the strips of salmon to the sauce , and simmer for 10 minutes more . Add the heavy cream to the sauce , and reduce to the desired consistency . Add the hot pepper sauce to taste . JMPROVISING FISH SAUCES When improvising any sauce , it is always helpful to have the actual foods that are available within view . Perfectly ripe tomatoes , fresh mushrooms , or a rarely seen seasonal vegetable will often provide an idea for an appropriate sauce . Foods that are fresh and in season are almost always appropriate ; drawing an idea from available ingredients is far more reliable and exciting than searching for foods that may less than perfectly fulfill a preconceived idea for a dish . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of old dishes happen while shopping in a large market . Many chefs miss this opportunity because hectic schedules compel them to order food by telephone and have it delivered unseen . et- Lima , anal , 9-ta n i , n t . cr.ae ' S-d , &ea.c.e.o,; 2,13 Sometimes a single ingredient will be impossible to pass by because of its beauty , freshness , or rarity and will become the focal point of the sauce . As a rule , the more perfect or inspiring the ingredient , the simpler the preparation need be . Some example approaches follow . Tomatoes Perfectly ripe late-summer tomatoes can be lightly stewed into a souplike base , which is then used as a simple sauce for fish . On those few occasions when perfect tomatoes can be found , little needs to be done to amplify or alter the tomatoes ' flavor , but variations might include stewing the tomatoes with the trimmings from the fish , augmenting their flavor with garlic , fennel , or onions , and then serving the preparation directly as a sauce or finishing it with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , cream , butter ( either directly or after the butter has first been worked into a beurre blanc ? like emulsion ) , compound butters , or vinaigrettes . The tomato can also be cooked down to a naturally thick sauce ( see chapter 17 , " Purees and Puree-thickened Sauces " ) and used as the base for a vinaigrette . Yellow tomatoes can also be used for these sauces and served alone or together with a red tomato sauce for contrast . A tomato sauce for fish can also be approached from the other direction , by preparing a sauce base such as a cream- or butter-based sauce aurore and then finishing it with tomato puree or a variation . Mushrooms The cooking liquid from mushrooms gives almost any sauce an ineffable finesse and is sometimes used in contemporary kitchens as a replacement for fish stock . When wild mushrooms are available , they can be used to give a deep , mysterious flavor to sauces . Their shapes also provide interesting contrasts for the presentation of the finished plate . Depending on the types available , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water or court-bouillon to provide a liquid sauce base ; the stems can then be pureed and used as a liaison and to contribute flavor or serve as the base for a vinaigrette , while the caps can be used to garnish the plate . Peppers Grilled or stewed sweet peppers have become a popular addition to fish dishes . Some examples include : 1 , f &..t.t.cee,; 1 . Peppers are stewed , pureed , and strained to convert them into a coulis and then worked into butter . The resulting compound butter is then served with grilled fish . 2 . Finely diced ( brunoise ) peppers are used to coat the surface of grilled or sauteed fish fillets . The diced peppers are sometimes combined with other diced vegetables or lightly bound with other sauces , such as beurre blanc , vinaigrettes , or vegetable purees. 3 . Peppers are stewed until soft , moistened with court-bouillon , and strained . The resulting coulis is then converted into a sabayon , which can be served as is or finished with butter ( plain , compound , or crustacean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Reduced pepper coulis can be used as the base for a hot vinaigrette. 5 . Chopped and stewed peppers can be used to flavor a mayonnaise ( either a classic andalouse or some variation ) . The mayonnaise can then be served as accompaniment to cold or deep-fried fish or whisked just before serving with hot fish stock or court-bouillon and used as a hot sauce . 6 . The peppers can be grilled ( preferably over wood ) , peeled , and then infused in a small amount of court-bouillon ; the infusion is then enriched with butter for a beurre blanc ? style butter sauce . INTEGRAL MEAT SAUCES gntegral sauces are made from the natural juices released by meats , fish , and vegetables during cooking . The methods used to prepare these sauces depend on whether the food is sauteed , poached , braised , roasted , or grilled . A well-made integral sauce is an extract of a food 's natural flavors and should capture and heighten the flavor of the food being prepared . Many contemporary chefs have at least partially abandoned many traditional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often have a fuller , more direct , more spontaneous , home-cooked flavor. gNTEGRAL SAUCES FOR SAUTEED MEATS Meats are sauteed by rapid cooking in a small amount of hot fat . The technique should not be confused with frying , where meat is cooked by being partially or entirely submerged in hot fat , or with stewing , where meats are often sauteed first in hot fat but then finish cooking in liquid . When meats are sauteed , they should fit neatly into the saute pan with no extra room . If the pan is too large , so that part of its surface is exposed during sauteing , the meat juices , which are essential to pan-deglazed sauces , will burn . An overcrowded pan , on the other hand , will prevent the meat from browning evenly and may even cause it to release its juices too quickly , so that it simmers in its own juices rather than browns . Meat should always be thoroughly dried with a towel 216 before sauteing , as any moisture left on the meat will create steam and will prevent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pan , which distrib-utes heat evenly . If the pan is too thin , it will be too hot in the area directly over the flame and in any section not in contact with the meat . This uneven heating in turn results in uneven browning and may cause the meat juices to burn in areas where the pan is too hot . Heavy-gauge copper or aluminum saute pans are best for sauteing . Iron skillets conduct heat well , but because of their black surface , it is difficult to see the juices that adhere to the bottom , to determine if they are burning . Nonstick and enameled pans should be avoided because the juices released by the meat will not adhere to their surfaces . When meats are sauteed , they release juices , which caramelize and attach to the bottom of the saute pan . These caramelized juices are intensely flavorful and are the basis for pan-deglazed integral sauces . Once the meat is removed from the pan , the first step in preparing a sauce is to remove the fat used for sauteing . If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formed a sticky , caramelized glaze adhering to the bottom of the pan ; the fat remaining in the saute pan is then simply poured off and discarded . Once the fat has been removed from the saute pan , the caramelized juices are then dissolved in liquid by deglazing the pan with water or with a flavorful liquid such as wine or stock . The bottom of the pan is then scraped with a wooden spoon to dissolve the juices into the deglazing liquid . The wide range of possible deglazing liquids makes this technique extremely versatile . Although an acceptable sauce can be made by simply deglazing a saute pan with wine , water , or stock , most professionals add other ingredients to give the sauce greater depth of flavor and a richer consistency . Using meat stocks either alone or in conjunction with wine will give a more complex flavor to a pan-deglazed sauce . Most stocks , however , require considerable reduction to concentrate their flavors and give them the consistency needed for a sauce . For this reason , meat glace or demi-glace ( in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consistency , body , and flavor to a sauce without requiring time-consuming last-minute reduction . In lighter sauces the meat glace can be replaced by veal or chicken stock that has been well reduced in advance . Once the saute pan has been deglazed and the body of the sauce rounded out with stock or meat glace , the sauce can be served as is or be lightly bound . Most contemporary pan-deglazed sauces are finished with cream or butter , which gives them a rich texture and flavor . When used in moderation , cream and butter will also lengthen a sauce without diluting it and weakening its taste . Pan-deglazed sauces can also be lightly thickened with vegetable purees ( see gmG.r.ae Neatau. , 217 chapter 17 , " Purees and Puree-thickened Sauces " ) , yogurt , or fresh cheese ( see chapter 5 , " Liaisons : An Overview " ) . Some chefs prefer unbound versions of pan-deglazed sauces , which con-tain no butter or cream . Excellent sauces can be prepared by simply deglazing the pan and adding meat glace or reduced stock until the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this method is that too much meat glace or stock will give the sauce a sticky , gluey consistency . Light-textured versions of pan-deglazed sauces prepared with very little or no cream or butter are often presented under the meat in a deep plate or wide bowl . When a pan-deglazed sauce has the desired consistency ( through reduc-tion or adding liaisons such as cream , butter , or vegetable purees ) , it can be finished with an almost infinite variety of additional flavorings . Vinegar , Co-gnac , freshly chopped herbs , tomato puree , mustard , and chopped truffles are just a few examples . Sauteed meats are usually accompanied by vegetables or other garnitures . Depending on the style and presentation of the sauteed meats , vegetables and other accompaniments are either served separately or combined with the sauce used to cover or surround the meat . Most sauteed dishes are completed by heating a garniture , such as mushrooms , small strips of bacon ( lardoons ) , turned vegetables , baby vegetables , or pearl onions , in the sauce before it is poured over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are sometimes confused by careless nomencla-ture that confuses stews and sautes . In strict culinary parlance , a saute is com-posed of pieces of meat ( including poultry ) that have been browned in hot fat and finished cooking without added liquid either on top of the stove or in the oven . The sauce for a saute is then prepared in the pan used to brown the meat and combined with the cooked meat just before serving ? not sooner . When pieces of meat are browned but then cooked in liquid , the preparation is an authentic stew . // POUT . ET SAUTE A IA MARENGO ( CHICKEN WITH TOMATOES , OLIVES , AND MUSHROOMS ) Although chicken sautes can be varied almost infinitely by changing the garni-ture , the cooking method for the chicken saute remains the same . Chicken Marengo was originally served with deep-fried eggs and crayfish , but most restaurants and home cooks usually serve the version that follows . 220 cJaucee 1 . Cut the chicken into quarters .

While the chicken is browning , cook the mushrooms in 1/2 cup ( 125 milliliters ) of the chicken stock in a covered 2-quart saucepan for 5 minutes . 4 . After removing the chicken , pour off the hot fat from the saute pan , and add the crushed garlic , chopped tomatoes , white wine , mushroom cooking liquid , and remaining stock .

STEAK WITH GREEN-PEPPERCORN SAUCE Any good cut of steak ? such as beef tenderloin ( filet ) , sirloin strip , or rib steak ? can be lightly cooked in a straight-sided saute pan , with the drippings used as the sauce base . The recipe below calls for meat glace and a reduction of cream as a liaison . It can also be made as a butter-enriched version by replacing the cream with 3 tablespoons ( 45 grams ) of butter or as a classic version by leaving out both cream and butter and finishing with demi-glace. gn , te . , e N ) 2 .

JNTEGRAL SAUCES FOR ROASTS : THE JUS Unlike pan-deglazed sauces for sauteed meats , which can be flavored and bound in many different ways , sauces for roasts are best kept simple and should capture the flavor of the roast . Additions that distort or weaken the natural flavor of the roast should be kept to a minimum . The best method for roasting meats is on a spit in front of a wood fire . When this method is used , a dripping pan ( lechefrite ) placed in front of the fire directly under the roasting meat is used to capture the drippings . Most of the fat is removed from the drippings , and the remaining jus is served as is . If the jus is pale , it can be rapidly cooked down on top of the stove until it carame-lizes ; the fat is then poured off , and the caramelized juices are deglazed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meats in the oven , be sure to select a heavy-bottomed roasting pan ( a saute pan will work in a pinch ) that closely fits the size of the roast . If the roasting pan is too large , the juices will spread out over its surface and burn . If the pan is too thin , any surface that is not in direct contact with the meat will overheat , also causing the drippings to burn . Many recipes , especially in the United States , recommend setting roasts on top of special racks , presum-ably to expose them to the heat of the oven and help them brown evenly . Unfortunately , when the roast is suspended over the pan on a rack , the drip9lteat C ) a.u.c.ee , 223 pings fall into an overheated roasting pan and burn . A better method is to set the roast on a layer of meat trimmings and vegetables . These contribute flavor to the finished jus and keep the meat from sticking to the pan . When the roast is done , the flavor and color of the drippings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the stove so that the drippings caramelize . The fat is then easily poured off and the pan deglazed with water or stock . When dealing with large roasts that release large amounts of natural juices , it is usually impractical and unnecessary to caramelize the juices . The fat is simply skimmed off and the jus served as is . The flavor of natural roasting juices , when skimmed of fat , can not be surpassed . The problem that most often confronts professional chefs is that most roasts do not provide enough full-flavored jus to go around . This problem can be resolved in several ways . In classic French cooking , roasting pans are often deglazed with jus de veau lie , which is brown veal stock that has been reduced and lightly bound with arrowroot . Arrowroot , when used sparingly , gives a light sheen to the jus and looks more like a natural , unthickened jus than stock thickened with roux . Contemporary chefs , who are usually less compelled to use thickeners , are more likely to stretch a natural jus with unthickened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flavor can also be prepared in advance with meat trimmings and used to deglaze the roasting pan . The flavor of a jus can also be reinforced with additional meat trimmings and aromatic vegetables . Some chefs surround roast meats with chopped onions , carrots , and meat trimmings , which cook along with the roast and contribute to the flavor of the meat juices . This method requires a certain amount of skill and judgment to determine when to add the vegetables and trimmings and how finely they should be chopped . If they are chopped too finely or added too soon , they are liable to burn ; if chopped too coarsely or added too late , they will remain undercooked and not contribute any flavor . Finely chopped vegetables can also be added to the roasting pan and caramelized on top of the stove along with the juices . In general , moisture should never be introduced into the oven during roasting ( which by definition is cooking with dry heat ) , but if the meat juices or chopped vegetables start to overcook during the roasting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the bottom of the roasting pan to prevent burning . Cooks are often baffled as to whether or not roasts should be basted . The purpose of basting is to prevent the surface of the roast from drying out and to give the roast an even color and sheen . In some instances , especially for poultry and game birds , a dry , crispy skin may be desirable and basting should be avoided . In true roasting , meats are basted with fat . Basting meats with 22 . aac liquid such as wine or stock may prevent browning and cause the meat to braise rather than roast . The choice of basting liquids depends to a large extent on intuition and skill . A chicken or game bird may benefit from basting near the end of roasting with reduced stock or meat glace , which will give it sheen , moist skin , and a full-bodied jus . GRAVIES AND THICKENED JUS In classic French restaurants , a natural jus or one that has been only lightly thickened with arrowroot is traditionally served in a sauce boat either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guests usually help themselves . This is both a simple and elegant method for serving roasts . In less formal cooking or in people 's homes , a gravy is likely to be served instead of a jus . A gravy is simply a jus that has been thickened in the roasting pan with flour . Most gravy recipes suggest removing most but not all of the grease from the roasting pan , stirring in flour with a wooden spoon , cooking the mixture for four or five minutes , and then adding water or stock . Although there are , of course , more refined and sophisticated methods for dealing with meat drippings , one of the most reassuring is a simple flour-thickened gravy . A natural jus can also be thickened with pureed vegetables . The easiest and most flavorful method is to roast the meat with chopped aromatic vegetables such as carrots , turnips , onions , or garlic , degrease and deglaze the pan , and force the vegetables and cooking jus through a food mill or strainer . In restaurants or other professional settings where this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side and used as thickeners for the jus ( see chapter 17 , " Purees and Puree-thickened Sauces " ) , but the vegetables will not have benefited from being cooked with the fat and drippings from the roast . Most Americans are familiar with giblet gravy , which is finished with the precooked and chopped heart , liver , and gizzard of turkeys or chickens . Although this is an excellent method ? the chopped meats provide textural contrast and flavor ? a different and somewhat more flavorful jus is obtained by pureeing the giblets ( a food processor works well ) while still raw with an equal amount of butter . The puree is then beaten into the jus at the last minute . Another refinement is to replace the giblet mixture with a puree of foie gras ( see chapter 5 , " Liaisons : An Overview " ) . The natural cooking liquid from game , rabbits , and poultry is sometimes thickened with blood , usually used in combination with the pureed liver and a gnte. , y e M. eJauce.a 225 few drops of Cognac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Liaisons : An Overview " ) . Sauces for roast game also benefit from a few crushed juniper berries infused in the jus before the addition of the blood . MODEL FOR PREPARING A JUS Main Ingredient The meat to be roasted is placed in heavy-bottomed roasting pan . Aromatics ( alone or in combination ) These are added to the roasting pan with the meat . OVEN-ROASTED CHICKEN WITH NATURAL ' US In kitchens with professional-quality stoves and hot ovens , it is rarely necessary to brown the chicken on top of the stove before roasting . The smaller the bird being roasted , the more likely will be the necessity for prebrowning ? by the time a quail browns in the oven , it will have dried out and overcooked . The recipe that follows suggests browning the chickens in a mixture of butter and oil ; clarified butter may be substituted for that mixture . Older recipes suggest covering the breast of a roast chicken with a sheet of fatback ( bard ) for the first stage of roasting so the thighs and breasts will be done at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a bit of a nuisance when sheets of fatback are not on hand .

JNTEGRAL SAUCES DERIVED FROM POACHED MEATS Poaching is one of the most fundamental and straightforward techniques for cooking meat . In English-speaking countries , we have the habit of speaking of boiled dishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually poached ? the poaching liquid is never allowed to reach a full boil . In France dishes such as pot au feu ( " boiled " beef with vegetables ) , poule au pot ( poached hen with vegetables ) , and innumerable potties ( poached meats , usually pork with beans or potatoes and vegetables , almost always including cabbage ) have long been the mainstay of the rural diet . More refined poached dishes , such as blanquette de veau ( poached veal stew with cream ) , boeuf a la ficelle ( tender cuts barely poached in broth ) , and petite marmite ( a rich consomme with vegetables and marrow ) have made their way into middle-class homes and elegant restaurants . The age-old technique of serving poached meats surrounded with flavorful broth instead of a thickened sauce is popular with contemporary chefs because the dish is light and digestible . The difference between poaching and stewing or braising is largely a question of the amount of liquid used for cooking the meat . Stewed and braised meats are cooked in and so produce a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meat is completely submerged in liquid , provide a relatively dilute , souplike broth . Consequently , most sauces derived from poached meats require reduction or the addition of reduced stock , demiglace , or meat glace to intensify their flavor . For some poached meats ? the French pot au feu is a prime example ? the poaching liquid is left alone and either served as a separate course or around the meat ( here the distinction between soup and sauce is a bit cloudy ) . In a potee the meat ( often pork ) is gently simmered with starchy foods such as 228 eauc.ee , beans or potatoes , which give substance to the dish , and if they do not completely absorb the surrounding liquid , at least they lightly thicken and contribute body to the broth . There have been many so-called refinements ( refinements , yes , improvements , not necessarily ) of fundamental poached dishes such as potties and pot au feu . Boeuf a la ficelle consists of poaching beef tenderloin ( or another tender cut ) in the pot au feu broth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feu vegetables and broth . Contemporary chefs have taken this refinement several steps further , often serving game , pigeon , or even lobster and crayfish in a carefully reduced and clarified poaching liquid . Poaching liquids can also be thickened and finished with a wide variety of flavorful ingredients . The traditional French blanquette de veau is composed of chunks of veal poached in water or stock flavored with aromatic vegetables and a bouquet garni . When the meat is cooked , the broth is then thickened with roux and finished with heavy cream combined with egg yolks . Today the term blanquette is often applied to any meat or fish that has been poached and surrounded by a sauce derived from the poaching liquid and finished with cream . Poached chicken also provides a flavorful broth , which can be reduced and finished with cream or , more traditionally , converted into a veloute and finished with cream or vegetable purees and a variety of flavorful ingredients . Poached cooking liquids thickened with vegetable purees are analogous and sometimes almost identical to pureed soups . This is one area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to discern . The usual difference , however , is that a sauce is more intensely flavored and can be richer , simply because there is less of it . Table POACHED CHICKEN WITH CREAM AND EGG YOLKS This classic method for poaching chicken and finishing the poaching liquid with roux and a liaison of cream and egg yolks is the same as preparing a white veal stew ( blanquette ) . It is also similar to a fricassee , except that a fricassee is made with cut-up chicken , which is usually cooked gently in butter before being moistened with stock . ( continued ) // Contemporary interpretations of this recipe use the same technique for poaching the chicken , but the roux , egg yolks , and often the cream will likely be missing . A simple and satisfying version can be presented by simply serving the sliced chicken in wide soup bowls with the reduced broth . The broth can be scented with whole leaves of basil , chopped herbs , truffles , cubes of ham , and the like . Select a pot or casserole that will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarters with the clove .

Gently bring the stock to a simmer , and skim off any froth or fat that floats to the surface . Partially cover the casserole or pot with a lid . Check the broth every few minutes to make sure it is not boiling . After about 20 minutes , when the chickens are cooked ( the juices run clear when the middle of a thigh is poked with a trussing needle ) , transfer them to a plate , and cover with aluminum foil to keep warm .

Heat to just a simmer , and whisk in the remaining 3 tablespoons ( 45 grams ) of butter . Adjust the seasonings . JNTEGRAL SAUCES MADE FROM BRAISED MEATS Meat is braised by slow cooking in a small amount of liquid . The main difference between braising and poaching is that braising is accomplished in a minimum amount of liquid , whereas poaching requires a relatively large amount of liquid , enough to cover the meat completely . Usually herbs and aromatic vegetables are braised along with the meat for extra flavor and complexity . As meat cooks , it releases juices into the surrounding liquid , which becomes intensely concentrated and flavorful . If the braising has been done carefully , little if anything needs to be done to improve the flavor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many different techniques and approaches to braising , as well as an elaborate and contradictory terminology that often confuses even experienced cooks . Stews are simply braises in which the meat has been cut up into small pieces , browned or not depending on recipe or whim , and covered with water , stock , or aromatic liquids such as wine , cider , beer , or vinegar . Stews are infinitely varied and are subcategorized into an endless variety of dauber , estouffades , coq au vin variations , and fricassees . Until the middle of the nineteenth century , braising and stewing always implied that the meat was cooked for long periods , until the muscle tissue had completely broken down and the meat was tender . This technique is called brown braising . Since then , many chefs also use a technique known as white braising for tender cuts of white meat , such as veal or pork . Meats that are white-braised are not browned and are cooked in a small amount of liquid 232 e ) aucea , only long enough to reach a relatively low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes eture ) is a type of braise in which the meat is cooked covered with no or only a small amount of liquid . When meat is cooked covered with no liquid ? only butter ? the technique is called poelage . Brown braising is the more traditional technique and is best used for relatively tough cuts of meat , either white or brown . There are several ways that large pieces of meat ( three to seven pounds ) can be brown-braised , but the oldest and most sophisticated uses a two-stage process that works especially well for both red and white meats . In brown braising , the meat is carefully larded ( to prevent it from drying out ) , browned in fat along with aromatic vegetables , placed in a close-fitting casserole , and covered halfway with water or stock . The casserole is then covered ( with the lid inverted so that moisture accumulates , drips down over the meat , and bastes it from inside the pot ) , and the pot is placed in the oven for two to three hours , depending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is easily pierced with a skewer , it is gently transferred to a clean casserole , and the braising liquid is strained into a saucepan , where it is reduced slightly and carefully degreased . The braising liquid is then placed in the new casserole with the meat , and the whole thing is returned to the oven . The braising continues , uncovered , and the meat is basted with the reduced liquid until a shiny glaze forms on its surface . In traditional brown braising , relatively large pieces of meat are braised long enough for the fibers to break down and soften , a minimum of two hours . Some recipes call for slow cooking of meat for much longer periods , even to the point where the meat can be served with a spoon ( a la cuillere ) . A quicker and more straightforward technique for braising meats is simply to tie the meat , brown it in butter , and bake it slowly in a tightly covered pot with aromatic vegetables . From time to time the pot should be checked so that a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the juices on the bottom of the pot from drying up and burning . This is the method most often used for American pot roasts or French etuves . Meats braised in this way can be cooked to a relatively low internal temperature ( as for roasts and white braises ) , or the process can be continued until the meat fibers soften in the same way as brown braises , in which case the meat should be larded to prevent it from drying out . When meat is cooked with butter and no additional liquid , the technique is calledpoelage , sometimes translated as pot roasting . Because this technique provides little liquid from which to prepare a sauce , the bottom of the pot or casserole is deglazed with water , stock , or wine after removing the meat , and the liquid is then gently simmered to extract the flavor of the juices and gn.t.ra.e 9rL.t &.uc.ee,; 233 aromatic ingredients left in the bottom of the pot . Poelage is very similar to oven roasting , the only difference being that a covered pot is smaller than an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water , stock , wine , or a combination . The simplest approach is to place the meat in a casserole or close-fitting pot along with aromatic vegetables , a bouquet garni , and enough liquid to come halfway up the side of the meat . The pot is then set on top of the stove until the liquid comes to a boil . The whole thing is then baked in the oven , with or without a lid , and basted regularly . The meat is cooked to the same degree of doneness as a roast . BRAISED VEAL RECIPES There are so many methods of braising , each with its own nuances that cause variations in the texture of the meat and the flavor of the sauce , that it is sometimes difficult to sort out the various techniques . The recipes below are all for a tied shoulder clod of veal to make comparison easy , but veal round will work well for white braising and pot roasting ( poelage ) when the meat is not cooked long enough to dry it out . American butchers usually use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is tied up for roasts and braises . The smaller pieces of the shoulder are cut into chunks and used as stew meat . The shoulder clod is tender enough to be used for roasting , but it can also be braised . ETOUFFEE OF VEAL SHOULDER CLOD Most recipes for white braising suggest moistening the braise with enough stock to come halfway up the meat and then cooking uncovered with frequent basting . In an etouffee the stock is added a bit at a time so that it can gently caramelize during the braising . If too much stock is added at the beginning , the finished jus will have the flavor of a poaching liquid and may require reduction . If too little stock is added , the juices will caramelize and burn . ( continued ) // 2 . Select an oval casserole that will just hold the tied shoulder clod . Sweat the onions , carrots , celery , and meat trimmings in the clarified butter in the casserole until the vegetables are shiny and translucent . 3 .

If the braising liquid evaporates and starts to caramelize on the bottom of the casserole , add another 1/2 cup ( 125 milliliters ) of stock . Continue in this way until the veal is done ( see note below ) . The veal is done when the juices run clear when the clod is poked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 135 ? to 140 ? F ( 60 ?

Skim off any fat that floats to the surface of the strained liquid , and serve over the meat or in a sauce boat alongside . Note : The jus for an etouffee is best when the cooking liquid is kept constantly on the verge of caramelizing . The amount of stock that must be added during the last stage of cooking depends on the oven temperature and the amount of liquid released by the veal . gn1erae Jl7aat 5a , we , 2. &; 235 POT-ROASTED VEAL SHOULDER CLOD ( POELAGE ) In authentic poelage no moisture comes in contact with the meat during cooking ; it is cooked in a covered casserole with mirepoix vegetables and butter alone .

STEWS Stews are braises made with pieces of meat or poultry instead of whole birds or large cuts . The best meat stews are made from gelatinous and relatively fatty cuts . When leaner , more tender cuts are used , the stew is greatly improved by inserting a strip of fatback into each piece so that the meat is moistened from the inside while cooking . // The character of a finished stew is not only determined by the type and cut of meat or poultry used , but by several other factors : whether or not it is browned before being moistened , the type of moistening liquid , the types of aromatic vegetables used , the herbs used in the bouquet garni , the final liaison if any , and the final garniture . Strips of pork rind or split and blanched pork or veal trotters are also sometimes added to stews and braises to support the texture of the finished liquid . In French classical and regional cooking , a variety of terms describe stews . Some of the names only indicate that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to the techniques used in its preparation . The term ragout can refer to almost any stew but has negative connotations , as does galimafree , a completely acceptable term for a medieval stew , but in modern French it translates roughly as " mess . " Stews can be divided into two categories : brown stews , for which the meat or poultry is cooked in fat before moistening , and white stews , for which the meat or poultry is directly moistened without preliminary cooking . In brown stews the meat or poultry is often dredged in or sprinkled with flour before being cooked in fat . There is very little difference between a white stew and pieces of meat that have been poached ? the only distinction is the amount of liquid used . The terms white braise or stew and brown braise or stew refer to whether the meat has been browned , not to the final color of the sauce . Thus , a beef stew made with red wine , without browning the meat , is still a white braise , even though the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beef into 3-ounce ( 75-gram ) cubes .

Sweat the chopped vegetables and crushed garlic in fresh butter in the saute pan . Sprinkle the vege-tables with flour ( optional ) , and cook gently for 5 minutes more .

Strain the stewing liquid into a 2-quart saucepan . Bring it to a slow simmer , and skim off any froth or fat that floats to the surface . The stewing liquid can be reduced to the desired thickness or bound with beurre manie ( the most traditional method ) , arrowroot , vegetable purees , or other liaisons . 10 . Spread the solid ingredients on a baking sheet . Separate the meat from the chopped vegetables , which should be discarded or can be pureed for use as the liaison . Reheat the cubes of meat in the thickened stewing liquid . Serve with an appropriate garniture . POULTRY AND RABBIT BRAISES AND STEWS The techniques for stewing poultry and rabbit are essentially the same as for veal and red meats . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chicken has been cut up , gently cooked in butter without being browned , and stewed with water or stock . The cooking liquid is then finished with heavy cream and egg yolks . The term is sometimes used more loosely to define any chicken or white meat that has been cooked in a small amount of liquid after a gentle preliminary cooking in fat . Fricassees differ from sautes because the chicken is finished cooking in liquid whereas sautes are cooked entirely with a small amount of fat either on top of the stove or in the oven . Older poultry can be braised , either cut into pieces as for a coq au vin , or left whole . One excellent method for cooking whole chicken or other small to medium-size poultry is to cook it covered in a close-fitting casserole with a small amount of liquid . When poultry is prepared in this way ? the French call it en cocotte ? it is cooked to the same doneness as roasts and white braises . Brown braising of poultry is unusual partly because the older birds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readily available , and even when successfully accomplished , long-braised poultry white meat tends to dry out . The only way to prevent this problem is to lard the meat thoroughly with strips of fatback ? a laborious ( but worthwhile ) task that few restaurants are willing to undertake . Most of what is served as coq au vin ( rooster braised in red wine ) in American restaurants is really a red-wine chicken saute. grite.rta.e 9lZeat a c 2 1 POUT.ET EN COCO77E ( WHOLE CHICKEN IN A CASSEROLE ) Chicken cooked in this way is first browned either in the oven or on top of the stove before it is placed in an oval casserole along with vegetables and strips of bacon , etc . Some recipes then suggest cooking the chicken with butter alone ( poelage ) , while others suggest adding a small amount of liquid , such as water or wine . The casserole is then covered and the chicken baked for approximately one hour . Cut the bacon into 1- by 3/s-inch strips ( lardoons ) , and blanch them in boiling water for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saute pan . Remove them with a slotted spoon . Truss the chicken , and brown it in the fat rendered by the bacon . Remove the chicken from the saute pan , and brown the pearl onions and potatoes . Place the chicken , lardoons , onions , potatoes , and stock in a close-fitting casse-role , and cover . Bake the casserole in a 350 ? F ( 175 ? C ) oven for approximately 1 hour . Transfer the chicken and garniture to a plate or platter , and strain the liquid in the casserole into a small bowl , pitcher , or fat separator . Skim off most of the fat and serve in a sauce boat . 2'i2 au.c.e.a , COQ AU VIN ( ROOSTER BRAISED IN RED WINE ) Traditional recipes for coq au vin finish the sauce with the rooster 's blood , which is still a good idea if starting with a live bird ( see chapter 5 , " Liaisons : An Overview " ) . Coq au vin is usually thought of as Burgundian , and some cooks underline this fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pan after browning and again to finish the braising liquid . Another approach is to give the dish the local character of where it is being prepared by using appropriate wine , herbs in the bouquet garni , and finishing with the appropriate spirit ( such as California Zinfandel , or Napa Valley brandy ) . In the recipe that follows , the pieces of rooster are coated with flour , browned , and moistened with red wine ( traditionally , Burgundy ) . The consistency of the braising liquid is adjusted at the end by reduction and with beurre manie . For flourless versions , the original flour and beurre manie can be omitted , and the braising liquid lent natural body by including blanched pork rinds in the braise . The finished braising liquid can also be combined with concentrated chicken stock , or meat glace can be added to give it body . With either method the braising liquid is then reduced to the desired consistency . Coq au vin is traditionally finished with a garniture of separately cooked small mushrooms , pearl onions , and triangular croutons. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salt pork into thick lardoons , and blanch them in boiling water for 5 minutes .

Whisk the beurre manie into the liquid a tablespoon at a time , until the braising liquid has the desired consistency . Adjust the seasonings . ( The flavor of the braising liquid can usually be improved by adding a tablespoon or two of good vinegar and Cognac . ) Gently heat the rooster and the mushroom and pearl onion garniture in the sauce . Dip the tips of the croutons in the sauce and then in the parsley . Arrange the croutons around the serving platter . CHICKEN FRICASSEE A fricassee differs from a saute in that the chicken is gently cooked without browning and then finished in liquid . Although some contemporary recipes have stretched the traditional definition , thoroughly browning the chicken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a classic fricassee should be almost perfectly white and the braising liquid always finished with heavy cream and egg yolks . In the recipe that follows , flour is sweated with onions in the butter used for searing the chicken to form a roux . A more intensely flavored sauce can be prepared by eliminating the flour , moistening the chicken with a well-concentrated white stock , and reducing the braising liquid to an almost demi-glace 2 eJcLUC , consistency before finishing with the cream and egg yolks . It is also possible to eliminate the egg yolks , reduce the cream alone , and finish the sauce with 2 or 3 tablespoons ( 30 to 60 grams ) of butter . 1 1 . In a straight-sided saute pan , gently cook the seasoned chicken pieces , skin side down , in 4 tablespoons ( 60 grams ) of the butter .

METHODS AND INGREDIENTS FOR BRAISES AND STEWS Preliminary Browning Classic French cookbooks claim that preliminary browning of braised meats is necessary to create a seal , to retain the meat 's natural juices during the first stage of braising . The reasoning behind this theory is that , as the internal juices are released within the meat , pressure is generated , which separates the meat fibers and aids in the cooking . All theory aside , perfectly acceptable braises and stews can be prepared without preliminary browning . Preliminary browning does , however , improve the color of the braising liquid and , especially if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the braised meat or stew a somewhat more complex flavor . Initial browning also offers the chef the opportunity to flour the meat , which will help bind the finished liquid without giving it a floury taste . Browning cubes of meat for stews requires a certain amount of care and attention . If the meat is cold or added to the hot pan all at once or the pan or pot used for browning is not hot enough to begin with , the meat will not brown properly and may even release liquid and begin to boil in its own juices . This all has a disastrous effect on the meat , so it is best to add the meat to the pan in increments , about a quarter at a time to prevent sudden cooling of the pan . Care should also be taken when turning the meat . If it is turned haphazardly or all at once , it may cool the pan too quickly , causing the juices to release . When browning large amounts of meat , it may be necessary to change pans during browning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Moistening Liquids and Aromatic Vegetables Moistening liquids for stews and braised meats have traditionally evolved out of necessity . Germans have long used vinegar ; the French , wine ( or cider in Normandy ) ; the Irish have had to rely on water ( with potatoes contributing body ) ; and Caribbean cooks sometimes use rum . Some recipes augment these liquids with various types of tomatoes , purees of capers , pickles or olives , and of course , stock . Standard aromatic vegetables ? onions ( often studded with a clove or two ) , celery , and carrots ? are sometimes replaced or augmented with garlic , turnips , or chilies , depending on nation or region . The combinations of 2.46 moistening liquids and aromatic vegetables used in stews and braised meats are almost limitless , which is probably why no braise or stew tastes exactly like another . The Bouquet Garni The bouquet garni has become so standardized that chefs often add it to a stew with little thought as to how the herbs meld with the stew 's other components . Rarely will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ components of a bouquet garni , clash with the other aromatic ingredients in a stew , but often a bouquet garni can be used to give a stew individuality and distinction , with the addition of other herbs . Early French recipes often called for basil and hyssop in a bouquet garni ; Italian and southern French cooks will often add marjoram , wild thyme , or oregano . In Mexico a piece of cinnamon stick will sometimes make its way into the bouquet garni . Medieval cooks , more attuned to spices than herbs , often simmered their meats in elaborate combinations of saffron , ginger , cinnamon , and other spices . Marinades Meat for stews and braises is often given added flavor by being first marinaded in various mixtures , usually containing wine or vinegar , herbs , a small amount of oil , and sometimes spices such as cloves , juniper berries , and crushed peppercorns . Although some contemporary chefs feel that marinades sometimes distort the natural flavor of meats , when used discreetly they give aromatic support and character to stews and larger pieces as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aromatic vegetables , herbs , and spices that will be braised along with the meat . If strong liquors , such as Cognac , grappa , or whiskey , are being used in the braise , they should not be added to the marinade ? they will give the meat an odd , unnatural taste . When the meat is finished braising or stewing , the chef should be left with an intensely aromatic , flavorful liquid . Often this liquid , after an initial degreasing , is complete ? it is simply served with the stew or atop slices or spoonfuls of the braised meat . Liaisons for Braising Liquids At times , especially if no flour has been used to brown the meat and no pork trotters or rinds have been added during braising , the braising liquid may be too thin or not have enough flavor . The most straightforward approach is simply to reduce it until it has the proper flavor and texture . If this is impractical , there are several methods that can be used to thicken the liquid . In classic French cooking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red-wineInI of 9IIQ.ctt &u.,a.a.; 247 moistened stews and braises . This solution has the advantage of being quick nd , if carried out properly , of not giving the stew a starchy taste . For veal and ork that has not been cooked with red wine , the resulting clear , jus-like raising liquid can be thickened with cornstarch or arrowroot ( first worked to thin paste with a little water or stock ) , which will contribute a natural jus-like been and consistency if used carefully . In some recipes , such as a classic hicken fricassee , the thickener ( in this case cream and egg yolks ) is inherent n the definition of the dish . Well-reduced stocks or meat glace can also be dded to braising liquids to give them body and lengthen them if not enough s available to moisten the meat . The modern aversion to flour and other starch-based thickeners has led hefs to experiment with new and sometimes very old methods of thickening raising liquids . An obvious and wholesome approach is to puree the aromatic egetables that have cooked with the stew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until it has the desired thickness . The Irish stew , whose potatoes give body to the liquid , is an example of a vegetable giving body to he surrounding liquid as an integral part of the braising process . Some chefs reduce braising liquids or add meat glace to give them a hicker consistency , almost like demi-glace . The liquid is then finished with utter . These sauces have great depth of flavor and considerable finesse , but many find them too rich and think their refinement detracts from the satisfying arthiness of a hearty stew . Red-wine stews can also be finished with a small mount of foie gras pureed with butter . Braises and stews prepared from rabbit , game , and rooster ( an authentic oq au vin ) are sometimes thickened with the animal 's blood , either alone or ombined with the pureed liver of the animal . The French call such dishes ivets ( see chapter 5 , " Liaisons : An Overview " ) . ADJUSTING THE FLAVOR OF BRAISING LIQUID Although a properly made stew or braise will always produce a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flavor of the liquid by underlining one or more of its elements or by finishing it with distinct and assertively flavored ingredients to give it an individual or regional character . Many of the echniques suitable for brown sauces ( see chapter 7 , " Brown Sauces " ) can be used to improve the flavor of braising and stewing liquids . Careful additions of vinegar , Cognac , or marc will often bring up the flavors inherent in the stew without distorting them . The most common and useful final flavorings for stews and braises are freshly chopped herbs . Chopped fines herbes ? without tarra- gon ? either alone or in combination , or tarragon alone is best for flavoring 2 ' 8 CJ ctiu cab. , delicate braises of chicken , pork , or veal cooked with water or stock . More assertive meats , such as beef , lamb , or venison , especially if they have been braised with red wine or vinegar , can do with more assertive treatment . Freshly chopped marjoram or oregano will give the dish a southern French or Italian character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final distinction to a Mexican-style stew . A skilled saucier is likely to use a combination of methods to adjust the consistency and flavor of a finished braising liquid . He or she may reduce the liquid slightly , thicken it with aromatic vegetable puree , and finish it with a final touch of butter ; or he or she may prefer to leave the braising liquid alone and serve the stew or braise in the style of a hearty , red-wine soup . Garnitures The term garniture is somewhat confusing because it is used in so many different ways . In America a garniture often means a bit of decoration , usually not meant to be eaten , which is put on the side of the plate to give added color ? most commonly , a sprig of parsley . In French terminology a garniture is usually a vegetable or vegetables served as an accompaniment to meat or fish . Garnitures for braised meats and stews are often served over the sliced meat or along with the pieces of meat in the stew , to give the impression that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ component of , the braise or stew . In some cases , especially in home cooking , stews and braised meats are served along with the aromatic vegetables used in the cooking . In most profes-sional settings , however , the aromatic vegetables are separated from the meat at the end of cooking and either discarded or pureed as sauce thickener . New garnishing vegetables are then either cooked along with the meat near the end of the braising , simmered in some of the braising liquid , or cooked entirely separately , to be added to the meat as it is served . Garnitures for stews and braises are almost endless . For many home-cooked stews , the aromatic vegetables are cut into same-size shapes and added to the stew during the last forty-five minutes of cooking . A somewhat more sophisticated approach , more often used in restaurants , is to cook the aromatic vegetables ( sometimes turned or cut into decorative shapes ) on top of the stove in some of the cooking liquid drawn off the stew or braise . Certain garnitures , such as wild mushrooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the stew or over the braised meat just before serving . This method is useful for accenting and giving character to the finished stew without altering the flavor of the braising liquid . A beef daube , for example , covered at the last minute with wild mushrooms sauteed with lavender flowers and garlic puree gri , k ra , fJlliat 2149 will benefit from the heady aroma of the mushrooms while the delicate sauvity of the braising liquid is left intact . Table STEAMED MEATS Although recipes for steamed meats are less common than those for roasting , poaching , or braising , the technique has several advantages over these other methods . Meat is best steamed in a couscousiere , which has a wide-mouthed pot for the steaming liquid and a second pot with a perforated base that fits on top of the pot of boiling liquid and holds the meat . Meats , however , should not be steamed in an industrial steamer , which uses pressure and temperatures above the boiling point . These steamers generate too much liquid of their own and make it impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Steaming can be used to impart delicate flavors to meat by adding aromatic ingredients , such as herbs , aromatic vegetables , wines , truffles , and spices , to the steaming liquid . Restaurant chefs often prefer steaming to poaching ( which produces similar results ) because it is quick , neat , and easy to organize . In most settings a relatively large amount of liquid is used to generate steam in the base of the steamer . As the meats cook in the basket above the boiling liquid , they release juices , which in most cases are not used because they are diluted in the steaming liquid . If a small amount of liquid is used in the bottom of the steamer , it will simultaneously reduce and capture the juices being released by the steaming meats . This liquid can then be served as a broth around the steamed meats or converted into a sauce in the same way as a poaching or braising liquid . When a small amount of liquid is used for steam- // ing meats , the steamer has to be watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Another useful method for steaming meats , especially chicken , is to seal them in a plastic roasting bag ( or a pig 's bladder ) along with reduced stock or aromatic liquids . The wrapped meat is then baked , or poached in simmering water , and steam is generated within the bag . In this way none of the flavorful liquid is lost . POULARDE A LA VAPEUR ( STEAMED CHICKEN In Lucien Tendret 's original recipe for this dish ( 1892 ) , a stuffing is prepared with cubed truffles and the chicken 's liver . In the modification below , truffle slices are slipped under the chicken 's skin and added to the steaming liquid . French chefs are predisposed to using black truffles , but the method is at least equally as exciting with fresh white truffles . The method can be adapted and the truffles replaced with herbs such as tarragon ( again slipped under the skin ) or with wild mushrooms chopped and placed under the skin or left whole or coarsely chopped and placed in the steaming liquid ( morels are especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a fricassee with roux , cream , and egg yolks , but in the modification below , the chicken is served surrounded with the well-truffled steaming bouillon . Peel the truffles ; chop and save the peelings . Slice the truffles with a Japanese mandoline . Slip three-quarters of the truffle slices under the skin of both the thighs and breasts of the chickens . Truss the chickens , cover well with plastic wrap , and store overnight in the refrigerator ( to permeate the meat with the truffle flavor ) . Pour the chicken stock , the remaining truffle slices , and the chopped peelings into the bottom of a steamer and bring to a simmer . Arrange the chickens in the gmtQraE MQat , &au.ceo,; 253 basket of the steamer , and cover with a sheet of crumpled ( this makes a tighter seal ) aluminum foil and the lid . It is imperative that the lid fit tightly . ( The original recipe sealed the lid on with a luting paste of flour and water. ) 5 . Steam , the chickens over low to medium heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escape from under the lid , turn down the heat . Do not remove the lid during the cooking . 6 . Carve the chickens and serve in deep plates or wide soup bowls surrounded with the steaming liquid . PoUT.FT ' EN VESSIE " ( STEAMED CHICKEN WITH STUFFED MORELS ) French regional cooks have long steamed chickens in sealed pigs ' bladders . More recently , variations on the dish have taken center stage in France 's choicest restaurants . Unfortunately , health regulations in the United States do not allow the sale of pigs ' bladders ( which in France are meticulously cleaned ) , and American cooks must make do with transparent oven bags , which are equally efficient but less picturesque . This method is usually used with delicate ingredients such as fresh morels , truffles , and foie gras , whose aroma would suffer if cooked in a less roundabout way . Contemporary cooks have also used the method for capturing the perfume of herbs . Truss the chicken . If the morels are sandy , quickly rinse them off in cold running water . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into small strips , and with the end of a Chinese chopstick , push a strip of foie gras into the stem of each morel. 25ab cJau.n , 4 . Select a pot that is large enough to hold the chicken , and fill it half full with water . Bring water to a simmer . 5 . Gently warm the concentrated stock ; it should not be too hot to touch . 6 . Place the chicken and the morels in a plastic roasting bag . Pour in the warm stock , and seal the bag tightly with string . Do not entrap too much air in the bag . 7 . Place the chicken in the simmering water , and cover . Steam for 11/4 hours . 8 . Remove the bag from the water . Just before serving , open the bag and transfer the chicken to a cutting board for carving . 9 . Pour the stock and morels into a 2-quart saucepan , and bring to a simmer . Adjust the seasoning . 10 . Present the chicken in deep plates surrounded by the morels and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock-based sauces ( such as sauce diable ) , simple sauces that function as condiments , or compound butters . These sauces are used because the juices released by grilled meats normally fall into the grill and are lost , making it impossible to prepare an integral sauce . It is , however , possible to prepare sauces that capture the flavor of the grill , which can then be used to accompany the meat . To accomplish this , the meat is partially grilled and then finished in stock or other aromatic liquids . The method is somewhat analogous to braising ( where meats are first browned on top of the stove and then moistened ) or to a salmis , a technique in which meat , usually game or poultry , is partially roasted , a jus is prepared with the trimmings , and the cooking of the meat is completed by gentle reheating in the flavorful jus. // Remove the breasts from the quails and squabs , and grill the carcasses over wood coals . When the carcasses are nicely browned , transfer them to a 4-quart saucepan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bouquet garni . Gently simmer the carcasses for 20 minutes . Skim off any froth or fat that floats to the surface . Strain the broth through a fine chinois and then through a cloth napkin . Season the breasts from the game birds , and grill them , skin side down first , over high heat . Leave the meat rare in the center . The quail breasts will take about 1 minute , the squab breasts about 2 minutes , and the larger breasts from 4 to 6 minutes . Slide the mushrooms on skewers , roll in olive oil , and grill . Pour the broth into a 4-quart straight-sided saute pan , and poach the grilled breasts for 30 seconds to 2 minutes , depending on their size . Remove the breasts , and adjust the seasoning of the broth . Present the breasts ( slice the duck and pheasant or partridge breast ) and mush-rooms ( removed from the skewers ) in deep plates surrounded by the smoke-scented broth . Note : Some duck breasts have a thick layer of fat , which makes them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ score the breast finely with a very sharp paring knife , and saute it , skin side down , for 5 to 7 minutes , to render most of the fat before grilling . The skin can also be removed entirely from the breast before grilling , but be careful not to overcook skinless breasts , as they dry out quickly . // In fast-paced professional kitchens , many chefs find that integral sauces require too much last-minute preparation . Roasting a chicken and preparing a jus to order is impractical in all but the most well-staffed restaurants . Stock-based sauces were originally invented to free the cook from the last-minute difficulties inherent in preparing integral sauces . Unfortunately , stock-based sauces , especially the way they are prepared in today 's economy-oriented kitchens , rarely have the satisfying direct flavor of a well-made integral sauce . It is , however , possible to organize a kitchen so that some of the elements necessary to an integral sauce can be accomplished in advance . Roasting Large roasts , such as turkeys or large cuts of beef , veal , or game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are roasted ahead of time , giving the chef ample time to prepare a jus . For smaller roasts , especially chicken and small game birds , which are often roasted to order , last-minute preparation of an individual jus is cumbersome and often impractical . For this reason , chefs often prepare a jus with appropriate trimmings just before the restaurant service ( see chapter 4 , " Stocks , Glaces , and Essences " ) . Braises Braised meats present little problem in a professional kitchen because they rarely suffer and are often improved by being prepared in advance and reheated to order . The braising or stewing liquid can be stretched if necessary by adding well-flavored stock . Extra body can be given to the liquid with meat glace . Certain liaisons , such as foie gras or butter , can be used only at the last minute , while others , such as arrowroot or flour , can be incorporated into the sauce ahead of time . When reheating a stew or a piece of braised meat , place it in a tight-fitting covered pan with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so the surrounding liquid never comes to a boil . If a last-minute liaison is required , simply transfer the meat to a plate and finish the sauce in the pan . If the stewed or braised meat is particularly fragile , wrap each piece carefully in a sheet of caul fat after the initial braising after it has thoroughly cooled . Poaching It is rarely practical to prepare sauces to order from poached meats , because the liquid is usually so diluted that too much last-minute reduction is required to make a flavorful sauce . Usually integral sauces for poached meats are prerIenae JIZe.ctif. eJa.ucee , 257 pared from the poaching liquid used the day before . In any case , meats are usually poached in advance ? pot au feu , blanquettes , and potties are not lastminute affairs . Poached meats should be reheated in the same way as stews and braises are : gently , in a covered pan , with a little stock . Sautees Preparing integral sauces for sauteed meats is a quick and straightforward process , provided that any necessary stocks and glaces are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proper degree ahead of time to avoid time-consuming last-minute reduction . If , on the other hand , the stocks are very reduced , the saucier will be constantly thinning the sauce with stock to adjust its consistency . One problem with pan-deglazed sauces is that they are usually speckled with particles of coagulated meat , which has adhered to the bottom of the pan . The obvious solution is to strain the sauce into a bowl or saucepan , but in a busy professional kitchen , this task is a nuisance . In some cases , especially if the sauce is garnished with chopped ingredients such as shallots , herbs , or mushrooms , straining is not necessary . INTEGRAL FISH AND SHELLFISH SAUCES gntegral fish and shellfish sauces are made at the last minute from the natural juices released during cooking . Fish and shellfish are especially suited to last-minute integral sauces because they cook quickly and release flavorful liquid as soon they are heated . Because the best method for preparing an integral sauce depends on the technique used for cooking the fish , this chapter is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crustaceans as well as the mollusks and sea urchins , the term is used here only for the last two . Because the techniques for cooking crustaceans are so specific , they are treated separately , in the next chapter . JJASIC PREPARATIONS AND INGREDIENTS Fish Stock To prepare fish stock , see chapter 4 , " Stocks , Glaces , and Essences . " Traditional recipes often call for fish stock as the cooking medium for fish and shellfish . If the fish stock is not overcooked and is prepared from impeccably fresh fish , it will help reinforce the sea-like flavor of an integral sauce . Unfortunately , fish stock is often prepared from stale fish and allowed to sit for too long before use . Such a stock will give any sauce a strong , fishy taste . 258 J n ca. r'w , R , cm , i eh.ed ii e i6au , cee : 259 Fish Glace To prepare fish glace , see chapter 4 , " Stocks , Glaces , and Essences . " Fish glace is often used to reinforce the flavor of fish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The advantage of fish glace is that it can be prepared ahead of time and kept in the refrigerator until needed . Unlike fish stock , it requires no last-minute reduction . Fish glace should be used very sparingly , or it will give the sauce a strong , fishy taste . Many contemporary chefs feel that fish glace , even when correctly prepared and used , detracts from the character of a sauce by giving it a nondescript fish flavor . The trend in the finest restaurants is to try to capture the individuality of a specific fish , which often means sacrificing convenience . Shellfish Cooking Liquids The liquid released by mussels , cockles , or clams during steaming has a delicious , forthright flavor and is excellent as a base for fish sauces . To prepare 1 cup ( 250 milliliters ) of the cooking liquid , place 1 pound ( 500 grams ) of mussels , cockles , or clams and V2 cup ( 125 milliliters ) of white wine in a pot and cover with a tight-fitting lid . Heat the pot on the stove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to time to redistribute the shellfish . After about five minutes , open the lid . When the mussels or clams have all opened , they should be scooped out , and the cooking liquid should be strained through a fine chinois or , if the liquid seems gritty , through cheesecloth . When using shellfish cooking liquids , remember that they are very salty , so avoid too much reduction and be careful if adding additional salt . Court-Bouillon Court-bouillon is popular with contemporary chefs because of its lightness and the subtle fresh flavor it gives to sauces . A traditional recipe is given in chapter 4 , but , as noted there , different herbs and vegetables can be used , depending on the type of fish being prepared , the region , and the whim of the chef . Courtbouillon can also be reduced and used as a flavor base when thicker sauces are needed . Wines Wine almost always works well in fish sauces , which are accented by its natural acidity .
