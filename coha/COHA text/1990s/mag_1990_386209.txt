<p> EVERY MIGRANT to the new world in the 16th century had to undergo trial by ordeal . Conquistador , friar , settler , slave . all had to cross the formidable North Atlantic in conditions only the desperate would endure today . Survival of the ordeal did not establish innocence - many crimes lay waiting to be committed in the Indies - but it did provide justification for intense drives towards wealth , martyrdom , and freedom . <p> As remarkable as the people were their wooden ships - distinctive craft that shaped history and entered into the collective imagination of succeeding generations as symbols of an unforgettable era . Everyone has heard of Columbus and his caravels , of galleons loaded with treasure , and the swift ships of the corsairs . Yet , when asked to differentiate a caravel from a nao , a galleon from a bergantin , or even a shallop from a trollop , all but experts are lost at sea . With the impending 500th anniversary of the 1492 discoveries bringing a deluge of references to ships , voyages and sailors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a watery subject . SIZING UP THE SHIPS <p> The caravel and the nao were the workhorses , the galleon , the warhorse of the exploration and exploitation of the Indies . They evolved out of prior experiences in two quite contrasting bodies of water . The Mediterranean Sea was characterized by prolonged calms which left sailing ships at a dead loss . When there was a wind it was flukey , and generally on the nose - that is , directly against whatever direction a boat was heading . The North Atlantic , on the other hand , generated lots of wind and big seas , and if a sailing ship did n't like the wind direction it had only to sit tight in port and await a favourable breeze . <p> Needless to say , the two areas fostered different types of vessels . The Mediterranean gave rise to the oared galley - easily propelled in the calms with its light , narrow hull of shallow draft and fine ends - and to the lateen rig whose triangular sails could tack against the wind with some efficiency . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medieval times was the cog , a stoutly built , high-sided , bluff-bowed barrel of a boat . It carried one large square sail and rode downwind to its destination . <p> The caravel was developed from both of these traditions in response to an acute need for a more versatile vessel . When the Portuguese began their explorations down the coast of West Africa in the 15th century , they first sent out an undecked fishing boat with a square sail and a few oars . It ran down the coast of present-day Morocco quickly enough before the prevailing northerly winds and currents , but the return trip took months to complete . Its square sail was hopeless against the wind , and rowing back against a steady current resembled rolling a boulder up a mountain . Something better was called for . <p> In Portugal , Prince Henry the Navigator had assembled cartographers , astronomers , shipwrights and master mariners to facilitate the African venture . They took the fishing boat and Mediterraneanized it - making it more easily driven , like a galley , by streamlining its hull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it a trim , capable lateen rig with a big sail forward and a smaller one aft to get the boat back upwind on the home voyage . In place of northern-style lapstrake planking they opted for smooth , edge-to-edge planking for a hull with less drag ( to this day such planking is known as caravel ) . Finally , a full length deck , and a shorter half deck over the stern , made it seaworthy and provided more shelter for the crew . <p> The caravel , for such it was , resembled a 19th century double-ended ketch , and in performance it was the sweetest sailing vessel of its time . In it Prince Henry had what he wanted - a boat to push ever farther down the African coast , to tack into tight bays , ghost along in light airs , weather heavy seas , and get back home before the crew died . The design proved successful ; larger caravels were built , with more masts and decks , and the design spread rapidly throughout Spain and beyond . <p> When Columbus set out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caravels . Most of the other early explorers favored them as well . Small caravels prosecuted the early Caribbean trade in pearls and Indian slaves , being adept at navigating the intricate channels between reefs and shoals in the Bahamas and through coastal islands in Venezuela . <p> By this time the caravels sailed under a variety of rigs , depending on how they were used . Lateen ( triangular shaped ) rigs predominated in coastal waters , but vessels making long offshore passages used the square rig to take better advantage of the following breeze . The Portuguese caravela redonda carried square rig on its foremast and lateen on the others for trips around Africa to India . Columbus changed the rig of the Nina from lateen to square in the Canary Islands just before setting out across the Atlantic . The Nina 's new rig was borrowed from the standard North Atlantic cog developed by the Basques and their neighbors in the vigorous pursuit of commerce and piracy . This ship had evolved into the nao ( contraction of navio the Spanish word for ship ) and now carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With slight variations to suit local conditions , the nao was known as a fluyt in Holland , a hulk in Germany , and a carrack in the Mediterranean . In all cases the hull owed its lineage to the cog . Fat and deep , round at bow and stern , the nao was an unabashed , capacious tub - the quintessential merchantman . Topheavy superstructures high above its bow and stern exascerbated its ungainly appearance . These seem so disproportioned to a modern eye that one questions whether artistic depictions were accurate , but they made perfect sense at the time . As trade was expanding , more space for passengers was needed , and as ships took a greater role in warfare the soldiers on board needed shelter . Since sea battles were still being fought with land tactics , forecastles and sterncastles fulfilled the requirements of soldiers and passengers . That these high structures increased windage and made the ships cranky performers mattered little , since they were n't expected to do well to windward . <p> Then came the introduction of cannon to marine warfare , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cannonballs splintered them like shrapnel . At the same time there was a pressing need for a vessel with a more seaworthy design , due to increasingly lengthy voyages to the New World and around Africa . <p> These factors resulted in the galleon , which first appeared in the 1520s and combined features from the caravel and the nao in a ship built specifically for war and trade . The galleon sailed better than the nao , but not so nimbly as a caravel - its hull shape was a compromise between cargo capacity and sailing performance , and was built strong enough to carry more guns and hold up under enemy fire . Rigged like a nao , some galleons carried a fourth mast with another lateen sail to enhance windward ability . The high forecastle of the nao was cut down and the sterncastle streamlined . By definition , the galleon sailed for the crown , to protect merchantmen naos in the annual Indies flota , to patrol against corsairs , and to carry back to Spain the most valuable cargoes , particularly the crown 's share of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sterns , adorned with statues of saints and a magnificent stern lantern . <p> Several other vessels merit a glance . Oared galleys , so important to Spanish power in the Mediterranean , figured only marginally in the Indies . They were difficult to get across the Atlantic , and once in the West Indies they performed poorly in the six foot seas ordinarily raised by the daily trade winds . A squadron of galleys did patrol the coast of Hispaniola for awhile , trying to put a dent in the rampant smuggling , but it proved notably ineffective . By 1583 the squadron grew dispirited after losing one of its vessels on a rock outside Puerto Plata with the death of all aboard . <p> Much more successful were the piraguas of the Carib Indians , dugouts hollowed from huge trees , large enough to carry 100 men . Instead of oars , the Indians used paddles which were much more effective in the seaways . Eager warriors wielded the paddles , then their weapons , in frequent terrifying attacks against Spanish settlements . <p> The piragua was in many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ construction had no seams to caulk , no planks to spring , no fastenings to rot out . Built of hardwoods resistant to worms , and hauled up on the beach by its crew when not underway , the piragua was proof against the toredoes ( wood boring worms ) that riddled many a European vessel . They possessed the notable advantage of being unsinkable ; at worst it might capsize . In that event everyone held on to their paddle , righted the craft , bailed it out with calabash scoops , and resumed the voyage . The Spaniards quickly appreciated its virtues and adopted it for their own uses carrying goods and people everywhere along the coasts and rivers . <p> The bergantin is little known but was an indispensable partner in the " enterprise of the Indies . " Known in English as the shallop , or pinnace , the bergantin was a small open boat of about 25 feet propelled by oars and sails . It was a service boat to the mother ship , and serve it did in an endless succession of tasks . Modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dock , but 16th century ships conducted most of their business from out on the hook . Docks were few and ships under sail had difficulty maneuvering in close quarters . The bergantin , and a smaller boat , the batel , ferried people and goods between shore and ship , towed the mother vessel in calms , took lines ashore when it did dock , sounded out depths in uncertain passages , took troops ashore with a cannon mounted in its bows , searched out safe harbors while the ship heaved-to safety offshore , and took the water casks up streams to refill the ship 's ever diminishing supply . <p> Much of the new world was explored and charted by bergantin . Amerigo Vespucci used his to go for days up the Amazon . Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa , sent to chart a passage through the Straits of Magellan , would anchor his nao in a safe harbor and go for ten days at a time in the bergantin on expeditions through the fjiords in freezing rain and howling gusts , over kelp beds and up current-wracked rockbound channels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magnificent waterway . <p> The bergantin 's ultimate use was to ferry the crew to safety from a sinking or stranded ship . Sometimes this meant a long open sea passage . Stuck in the steamy Golfo de Urab in 1505 after one caravel hit a reef and the others succumbed to worms , the famous pilot Juan de la Cosa embarked 100 men in two bergantins and a batel and set out north across the Caribbean , making landfall in Jamaica and finally reaching Hispaniola with half his men but all the gold , extorted from the Indians of Colombia . <p> At sea the smaller batel was carried on deck but the bergantin had to be towed . Men were stationed in it to steer , bail , tend the lines and keep it from surfing down waves and hitting the stern of the ship . In bad weather , the captain might leave them there too long , giving more consideration to his bergantin 's welfare than to that of his men . Severe conditions might prevent their being brought aboard at all . Then if the small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doomed . John Hawkins made that mistake when a sudden gale came up in the Bay of Biscay , on a voyage bound for Africa and America . As night fell his men could be heard over the wind calling for help . By morning they were gone . HAZARDS ON THE OPEN SEAS <p> Considering the obstacles they faced , one comes to admire the 16th century mariners for their dogged seamanship as much as for their audacity . The ships were well built , often in the Basque country where iron deposits and forests of oak and pine had fostered the shipwright 's craft . But ships built in northern climes deteriorated at an alarming rate in tropical waters . Oak , such a sturdy wood for framing and planking in cold seas , tended to rot in the humidity and heat of the Caribbean . Iron spikes corroded , and destroyed the wood around them . Without today 's epoxy glues and synthetic caulks , sprung timbers and leaky planks were common . <p> Their sails and ropes , made from natural fibers , also rotted easily . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bilge , they were patching sails , splicing lines , and praying their way through the next squall . Magellan 's ordeal - getting his tattered ships through the fierce storms and narrow passages of the straits that bear his name , while his sails were blowing out and his anchor lines parting - was an achievement as stirring , and far more admirable , than Corts conquering the Aztecs . <p> The worse hazard for ships was not storm or reef but a microscopic worm , the wood-boring toredo , unknown in Europe until ships brought it back . The Spaniards learned the hard way that the Caribbean was infested with this worm , especially the bays and backwaters with little current and warm temperatures like the Golfo de Urab . Toredoes enter unprotected wood and eat their way along the grain , growing bigger and bigger but leaving no outer trace of their presence . They devoured the northern hardwoods commonly used for planking until little more than paint held it together . The first warning might come when the bosun , banging on the hull to check its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Toredoes accounted for more lost ships in the early years than all other causes combined . <p> On his fourth voyage , Columbus almost sank en route to Jamaica because toredoes had turned his planking into swiss cheese . As his ship tacked against unremitting headwinds , the crew pumped day and night against rising bilgewater , fainting from exhaustion but powerfully motivated , until at last they made land and ran the vessel aground . The Admiral of the Ocean Sea and his men spent many a long month kicking their heels on the beach and swatting mosquitoes , waiting for help to reach them from Hispaniola . <p> Anti-fouling paint lay far in the future , but there was another way to deter the shipworm . While chemists still tried to turn lead into gold , seamen used lead to sheath their hulls . In a quiet cove with deep water close to shore they brought their vessel against the land and careened it . Removing the ballast , guns and heavy gear , they attached block and tackle to the masts and pulled the ship all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They stripped it to bare wood using flaming torches to melt away old pitch and tar , and once the hull was clean and dry , soaked it with pine tar and fish oil . This they followed with two layers of cloth soaked in alquitran , a combination of pitch , resin , grease and fish oil , and then nailed on a layer of sheet lead as thin as parchment . A last layer of alquitran sealed it off ; then they did the other side , re-embarked all the ballast and gear , and shoved off . It was a labor intensive process , in keeping with the rest of seafaring life . <p> Uncharted dangers posed another threat that only slowly diminished over time . Even after all the coast and major offshore hazards had been mapped , there remained innumerable isolated reefs , rocks , sandbanks and sea mounts yet to be " discovered " - i.e. , struck by somebody 's keel . To this day a great many underwater dangers bear the name of the ship that first foundered on it . Pilotage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the labyrinth of shoal water on Cuba 's south coast stayed up so many nights and days he inflamed his eyes and went temporarily blind . <p> Hurricanes have always threatened the seafarer in the West Indies . By the time the Spaniards realized that hurricanes had a season , the crown had already fixed the annual departure of the treasure fleet to coincide with its height . Ironically , had the Spaniards not been so intent on enslaving and exterminating the Caribs , they might have benefitted from the Indians ' uncanny weather sense . The Caribs could accurately predict hurricanes . Aware of this , the 17th century English settlements sent emissaries bearing gifts to the Caribs at the beginning of every hurricane season with the request that they be informed if a storm was imminent . In the words of a contemporary sea captain , " Ten to twelve days before one was due , the Caribs sent the word ; and a big blow rarely failed to follow . " STEERING THE COURSE <p> A Spanish galleon was commanded by the captain and run by the sailing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every life depended , was the pilot , the most skilful seaman aboard . The pilot set the ship 's course , checked its position through celestial navigation , supervised the trim of its sails , knew the winds , currents , rocks , reefs and landmarks along the route . It was the pilot who was entrusted with the night 's watch ; instincts gained from years at sea could sense a squall building or shallows ahead in the dark . <p> A prospective pilot had to show 15-20 years of service on his route , attend classes on cosmography , and pass an oral exam before a committee of experienced pilots . For much of the 16th century , Spanish pilots were pre-eminent in Europe , writing the most influential treatises on navigation and seamanship , and setting the standard for the English and French to follow . <p> Unlike modern navigators who punch buttons on a Sat Nav and read the results , the 16th century pilot absorbed his subject from wind , sea and sky , mixing science with art and experience . The Spanish equivalent for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " , wonderfully expressive to an English ear of the difficulties encountered in estimating drift , current , course and speed . Still , his crude instruments were the simple rudiments of today 's sophisticated yet often vulnerable electronics . In place of a chronometer he used a sandglass measured for a minute or hour . To find speed he let run astern a chip of wood on light line and counted how many equally spaced knots passed over the rail in a minute - hence today 's word " knots " for nautical miles per hour . A seaman in the bows determined depth by heaving the sounding lead and the helmsman steered by a primitive compass whose needle was magnetized by the pilot before the voyage . <p> Celestial navigation required the most skill . Armed with tables of the sun 's declination , the pilot measured its altitude at noon - the highest point in its daily arc - from which he determined the ship 's latitude . Without exact time , longitude can not be obtained by celestial observation , so until the invention of the seagoing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A ship bound for Trinidad would sail down to 11 N latitude and run it down until the peaks of the island revealed themselves . <p> The instrument the pilot used to determine the sun 's altitude was the astrolabe , a circle of bronze graduated around the rim in degrees , with an adjustable sight/pointer which he aligned with the sun , while holding the astrolabe level ( plumb ) from a ring at its top . Doing this on the deck of a tossing ship required great skill . Different pilots on the same ship taking simultaneous sights might differ by more than a degree - 60 miles on the earth 's surface . Thomas pilots disagreed by over 50 leagues as to their position . In this incident the oldest pilot was proved right - clearly pilotage was n't taught or bought but was acquired over years of trying . HARDSHIPS OF SEA LIFE <p> In the 1500s most voyages to the Indies originated in Spain or Africa . To ensure payment of taxes , the crown insisted that all shipping leave from and return to Seville . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Guadalquivir River , the richest port in Europe . Triana , its working class district , became renowned for its seamen and its chandleries . <p> The voyage began at the Tower of Gold - repository of the Indies treasure - and made the transit downstream under short sail or towed by teams of oxen . Just before reaching the sea , the vessel anchored at San Lucar de Barrameda to take on last minute supplies and passengers , and to wait for the appropriate combination of tide and wind to cross the notorious bar at the mouth of the Guadalquivir . Special bar pilots kept track of the shifting sands brought down by the river in flood spate and constantly rearranged by the sea . When they conned a ship out through the entrance , strict silence was enforced aboard . <p> Once clear of the bar , the ships sailed southwest 600 nautical miles to the Canary Islands , taking advantage of the prevailing North to South windflow , and giving the African coast a wide berth to ensure sufficient sea room should a westerly gale blow up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , top up their water , take on wood for the stove , fresh vegetables , and live meat . <p> The provisions included onions and garlic , which keep for a month at sea , and goats , sheep , pigs , and hens in pens on deck where they waited their turn to serve . These were luxuries for those who could afford them . For the crew , staples of shipboard fare were salt meat and fish packed in barrels of brine , wine and oil , cheese , and ships ' biscuit , a hard dry bread that would keep for months . Although these " biscuits " were carefully sealed against vermin , they often got so infested by weevils that the crew waited until dark to consume their rations . <p> The best part of the voyage came between the Canaries and the West Indies . Sailing south/south-west , they picked up the tradewinds near 22 north and forged westward for three or four weeks with a steady breeze at their backs . Every day saw good progress , warm weather , cool breezes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dorado , or striped wahoo . Petrels dipped in the white wake and flying fish skimmed away from the bow over the clean blue sea . <p> While life above decks had its attractions , below it was a compendium of miseries for passengers used to the comforts ashore . Only a handful rated cabins in the sterncastle . Crew , soldiers and ordinary passengers had to find themselves a place below in a secluded corner where they carried on the routines of daily life as best they could . The smell belowdeck was atrocious . There were no toilets . The crew used a spot over the rail , but passengers relieved themselves in corners and over gratings . It all descended to the bilge , creating a vapor so intense as to be lethal . One unwary sailor opened a hatch to the bilge , inadvertently breathed the fumes and passed out , falling through to an appalling death . Pumping the bilge nauseated even hardened sailors , and the acids of the discharge ate the pump . <p> Wooden boat construction provided a thousand inaccessible crannies for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving aboard . Roaches crawled over everything , too numerous to kill . The only way to rid a ship of cockroaches was to burn or sink it . At least they were relatively harmless , unlike the rats . One ship experienced a plague of rats that killed the chickens , destroyed tons of provisions , and attacked sleepers . Passengers and crew killed 3000 of them . As the ship lingered in a calm , a dearth of provisions led to famine and only providential rain saved them from dehydration . Landfall ended their ordeal . <p> Sighting the high green islands of the Antilles at the end of the Atlantic crossing meant that the outward voyage was drawing to a close . Yet they also signalled the need for vigilance . Reefs and rocks encumbered many passages between the islands ; strong currents swept them . Disaster , at night or in bad weather , became much more likely in the proximity of land . <p> The easiest entrances to the Caribbean attracted the French and English corsairs , who began turning up in the Indies as soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Spaniards robbed the Indians , the corsairs robbed the Spaniards . If a Spanish ship attempted one of the less frequented channels they ran the risk of falling into the hands of their implacable enemies the Caribs . Scores of " cristianos " languished in captivity in Dominica in the 1580s , abducted in raids or wrecked on the island in passing . Caribs raiding fleets kept an avid eye open for the stray vessel weakly defended . In 1535 the residents of a seaside village in Margarita watched in horror as a becalmed caravel off their coast was overrun by warriors swarming aboard from their giant dugouts . <p> No doubt the fate of the 42 souls aboard was wretched in the extreme . But not all voyagers to the Indies had as much to fear from Carib attack or shipwreck . For some it could even be a deliverance . Bad as conditions were for those sailing out of Seville , they were much worse for those shipped out of the Bight of Benin on the west coast of Africa . There the Portuguese had established themselves and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inhabitants . They sent their caravels into the great rivers south of Cabo Verde and to strongholds in the Bight to pick up captives . Working back out of the airless Bight of Benin against the prevailing currents might take weeks before reaching the steady trade winds . The mortality rate for the prisoners chained below soared in prolonged calms , whereas a good breeze not only shortened the trip but helped dissiate the toxic stenches that traditionally emanated from a slave ship . <p> Like many other vessels of the era , some of the slave ships wrecked . Around 1575 one went up on Bequia , a small island in the Grenadines . Most of the Africans survived and were taken to nearby St. Vincent by its Caribs . After some years of subjugation , the Africans fled into the rugged interior , consolidated a base and ended up evicting the Caribs , making the island their own . Another ship , one of the earliest slavers , must have gone ashore on the windward coast of the Darien Isthmus because Balboa , en route to his discovery of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barred him passage through their territory . HOMEWARD BOUND <p> Returning to Spain the way they had come was impossible for square rigged ships - it would mean beating into the teeth of the tradewinds that had brought them over . Instead they had to sail over 1000 miles northwards to pick up the prevailing westerly winds to blow them home . This required traversing hundreds of miles of calms and variable winds that separated the easterlies from the westerlies . Leaving as they did in hurricane season , the ships were liable to calm and storm . <p> From Cuba the magic carpet of the Gulf Stream funnelled them northwards between Florida and the Bahamas , but then left them to shift for themselves through prolonged calms . Day after day the ship sat in the leftover swell from some distant wind , bobbing aimlessly , as supplies of food and water dwindled . Horses , great consumers of water , were jettisoned in such numbers on bad trips that their floating bloated corpses dotted the route and gave to the area a name that stuck . the Horse Latitudes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but sometimes too much . Autumn gales swept the ship towards the Azores and the sailors had to take in sail , reef , and take in more . If the gale became a storm they ran under the reefed trinquete ( foresail ) alone , and when that blew away they ran under bare poles . The ship ran for its life as mountainous seas reared up from behind and sometimes buried the deck in solid seawater . Then its seams and hatches leaked like sieves , soaking everything below - bedding , clothing , cargo . The cookfires were extinguished and sodden misery reigned in the gloomy half-light . Misery . and mounting fear . <p> If worst came to worst and the storm became a hurricane , if the ship 's rolling threatened to capsize her , then perhaps the extreme measure of cutting her heavy masts overboard would be ventured . A work party , tied with safety lines to keep them from washing away , would inch their way to the base of the mainmast and hew at it with axes . It was a critical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away the rigging to free it as it fell lest its butt-end stove in the ship 's hull in the tumultuous seas . <p> Then up came the bulkiest cargo - soggy bales of tobacco and indigo , logs of brazilwood , kegs of sugar - overboard . Even the guns , but that was easier said than done - a loose cannon rolling to and fro on its carriage between the decks was a bosun 's worst nightmare . dodging a ton of iron gun , trying to get a line around it and secured before it tore out of grip . <p> After the storm ended came sail sewing and jury rigging , the stretching of awnings and praying for rain , the hunt for rats to eat , and above all supplication to Our Lady for a fair wind and the sight of the rugged green Azores on the horizon . Luckily the islands are high , and stretched out well across the route home . They were hard to miss , and saw many a maimed ship come limping in close to death .
