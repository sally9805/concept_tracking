IF YOU ASK A MAN OVER 40 FOR HIS TENNIS PRO 'S ADVICE about his backhand or his broker 's suggestions about staying ahead in a volatile market , he 'll provide you with a detailed answer . But if you ask him about the results of his latest physical exam , he 's likely to respond , " Fine , fine , " while staring into the distance trying to remember when he last saw his doctor to check on the state of his health . Visiting a doctor periodically , at least every two to three years , makes sense for healthy men . Sensible or not , too many men just do n't do it . Men account for only 40 percent of visits to doctors , significantly less than the 60 percent women make . And it 's not just that they 're too busy minding their careers to keep an appointment . The disparity holds from the teen years through the mid sixties . By then , the medical conditions that often attend older age have begun prompting men to visit their doctors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I S S AY There may be a good reason why men are reluctant to see their doctors when nothing 's wrong : they do n't know how to deal with them . " Women are more deft at interacting with doctors , " says Paul D. Cleary , Ph.D. , professor of healthcare policy at Harvard Medical School 's department of healthcare policy " They tend to express their priorities more clearly and are better at getting information in a way they can use . " Morton Bender , M.D. , associate clinical professor of internal medicine at Yale University School of Medicine , agrees . Women , he notes , have more experience with doctors . They see gynecologists regularly and over the years have learned to talk to them . " But when a man goes to see a doctor , he wants to come in and say , Look , I 'm OK . Just tell me I 'm OK and I 'm leaving . " ' Yet , stresses Dr. Bender , a man 's middle years are just the time when he should begin having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coronary corridor , " he says bluntly . Although men are generally in good shape during these decades , this is the time for them to start paying keener attention to their health if they have n't already , notes Cleary . But they tend to deny that anything can go amiss . " They say , I 'm skiing , I 'm playing tennis , I 'm playing handball with the guys , it ca n't be me , " ' Dr. Bender says . Wrong , gentlemen . It certainly can . WHAT CHECKUPS CAN CHECK The heart is one of the body 's most efficient and durable organs , but heart disease still takes an inordinate toll on men . " Men are handicapped by virtue of their hormones , says William Hazzard , M.D. , professor of internal medicine at the Wake Forest University School of Medicine . " Before menopause , women are protected against heart disease by estrogen , but male hormones-androgens-seem to increase the risk of atherosclerosis , " the buildup of sludgy plaque on the walls of the arteries , which is associated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ check a man 's cholesterol level as well as his blood pressure , two of the big risk factors for heart disease , and do something if it looks like a problem is developing . " A wealth of studies leaves no doubt that controlling high blood pressure and elevated cholesterol can save lives . Perhaps of more immediate interest is that both high blood pressure and high cholesterol contribute to impotence ( technically , " erectile dysfunction " ) . Although common wisdom once attributed almost all impotence problems to psychological factors , researchers now know that the vast majority of cases are caused by physical problems ( see " Sex and the Mature Man " ) . Cholesterol levels that cause blockage in the blood vessels leading to the heart contribute to reduced blood flow to the penis . High blood pressure also interferes with a healthy sexual response . In one study , nearly two out of ten men with high blood pressure experienced some impotence . Further , notes Thomas P Duffy , M.D. , a professor of internal medicine at Yale University School of Medicine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and frequently undiagnosed disease called hereditary hemochromatosis , " an iron-storage problem . He explains that this genetic disease , most common among Caucasians of European background , " can show up in men in their 40s and 50s who have complaints about sexual functioning . " A new chromosomal marker enables doctors to screen for the disease relatively easily . So even if you do n't want to look at the various diseases that lie somewhere down the road , you-or you and your wife-may consider a visit to the doctor a good idea , if only to continue functioning well sexually . HOW TO TALK TO A DOCTOR " All of us need to be reevaluated periodically , " cautions Dr. Bender , " and the best way to do this is to have a checkup . " Begin by talking about your family history , he recommends . " If your doctor does n't bring it up first , ask , How will what happened to my parents and grandparents affect me ? ' Then talk about your own habits in regard to lifestyle issues such as exercise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ details enable the doctor to pinpoint risk factors and assess various symptoms . " The discussion between doctor and patient is essential , " says Dr. Hazzard , " but one that men have traditionally been uncomfortable with . " Women tend to be much more relaxed about this aspect of medical care . So in trying to get the man in her life to go for even a routine checkup , a woman may bring up the subject more than once . " My wife 's been urging me to go in for testing because a relative has had some serious problems , " Cleary relates . " She says , ' I do n't need to tell you this , you know all about it . " When even medical professionals find reasons not to make an appointment , what can a woman do to convince her man a visit is necessary ? Perhaps most important , avoid saying things that might make him feel guilty , which could prompt him to dig in his heels . Recognizing that most men become more concerned about their health after 40 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ongoing encouragement to move him toward the doctor 's office . That said , if a woman suspects her significant other has a problem requiring immediate attention , she has no choice but to become more assertive and insist that he seek a professional 's input . She might enlist the help of a family member or a trusted friend in this effort . So the message is simple to men over 40 who 've yet to get an official clean bill of health : pick up the phone and make that all-important doctor 's appointment . This is the time to start learning more about yourself . Sidebar <p>
