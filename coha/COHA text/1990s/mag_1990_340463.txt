In the frigid darkness between midnight and dawn , two troop carriers pulled up in front of a psychiatric hospital outside Vilnius and a phalanx of Soviet paratroopers in battle dress leaped out . The soldiers dashed up the stairs to the third floor , smashed doors and windows and dragged out about two dozen Lithuanian deserters who had been hiding in the ward . Some of the youths ; resisted , and were clubbed with rifle butts , leaving splashes of blood on the steps . The commander in chief of Soviet ground forces , General Valentin Varennikov , vowed that the army would round up all of the 1,500 Lithuanians who have fled its ranks over the past few months . <P> After 18 days of growing tensions between Moscow and Lithuania , the two sides seemed at first to be inching toward de-escalation last week . Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis conceded that he was willing to hold a popular referendum on independence , and Soviet army officials offered amnesty to Lithuanian deserters who turned themselves in . <P> But then Moscow 's fist clenched again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier , seized government offices in Vilnius and installed a new chief prosecutor charged with enforcing Soviet , not Lithuanian , laws . Meanwhile , a senior military officer in Moscow said no offer of amnesty had been authorized and criminal cases had been opened against all deserters . While Mikhail Gorbachev had not cracked down on the nationalist movement , Sajudis , or the separatist parliament , his power play had rendered Lithuania 's declaration of independence null and void . <P> Nonetheless , the crisis continued to underscore the difficult role that the army must play in Gorbachev 's Soviet Union . As ethnic conflicts and secessionist movements boil over in at least half a dozen republics , the military is increasingly being called upon to quell violence and to police disputes between citizens and their leaders . Faced with troop withdrawals in Eastern Europe , budget cuts at home and increasing criticism in the press , the 4 million-man armed forces have been plunging rapidly in both public esteem and institutional authority . Meeting with TIME 's editors in New York City last week , Vitali Korotich , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parliament , observed , " After the party bureaucrats , the military is the most unhappy part of our society . " <P> A hint of the army 's coming demotion should have been visible in February 1986 , when the 27th Communist Party Congress adopted the doctrine of " sufficient defense , " a clear departure from the long-held Soviet view that the best defense was an overwhelming offense . The military budget , which had regularly been increased as national income grew , was frozen in 1987 . Gorbachev 's intentions became clearer in December 1988 , when he told the United Nations he would unilaterally cut his military by 500,000 men and his $ arsenal of tanks by 10,000.
