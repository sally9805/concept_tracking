<p> Best known as the home of Magic Mountain , Santa Clarita , California has become an increasingly popular place to raise a family . The warm air and spacious surroundings are a refreshing change from the hustle and bustle of Los Angeles , where many of Santa Clarita 's residents work . According to the 1990 census , Santa Clarita was the 8th fastest growing city in the country . A new light rail system that feeds directly into Los Angeles and facilitates access to that city is expected to foster Santa Clarita 's pattern of growth for several years . <p> When Pat Shaw and her family moved to Santa Clarita , they were looking forward to affordable real estate prices and a calmer pace of life . What Pat Shaw had not anticipated was the difficulty in finding child care for her infant . <p> Lisa Miller , a referral counselor for the Child Care Resource Center , a resource and referral agency serving the San Fernando Valley , handled Ms. Shaw 's telephone call to her agency . Her response was identical to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few spaces in infant centers in Santa Clarita and fewer family day care homes within the city . Child care openings were scarce . <p> As Santa Clarita continues to grow , the number of families needing child care is expected to increase significantly . Yet the immediate resources necessary to expand the supply of child care are not readily available . <p> In other regions of California , however , the Child Care Initiative Project , an innovative public/private partnership designed to build the supply of child care throughout the state , has achieved remarkable success in recruiting and training providers and boosting the number of child care spaces . <p> The Child Care Resource Center applied to the California Child Care Initiative Project for funding to launch a family day care provider recruitment and training project . Using that funding and the assistance of other contributors , the Child Care Resource Center embarked on a project that resulted in 119 new family day care providers and 400 new child care spaces . <p> What happened in the San Fernando Valley is just one example of the impact that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the project celebrates its 10th anniversary , it reflects the following accomplishments : Raising almost $7 million for family child care provider recruitment and training from more than 400 contributors ; Recruiting more than 3,650 new family day providers , creating more than 14,000 new child care spaces , and training more than 22,500 caregivers ; Working with child care staff in Michigan and Oregon to adapt the Initiative in those states and to further adapt the model within California to include rural sites and increase the supply of infant/toddler care ; Being a key reason why California was designated by Working Mother magazine as an exceptional state in providing child care for the third consecutive year ; and Creating numerous publications specific to child care providers , including The Family Day Care Handbook and the Spanish-language training module El Comienzo and Esto Es Familiar , which have been used nationally . Identifying The Need <p> The California Child Care Initiative was created in 1985 to address the shortage of licensed quality child care in California communities . Developed by Bank America Foundation and the California Child Care Resource and Referral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local public-private partnership . The State of California 's contribution to the program is up to $250,000 a year , based on a two-to-one match of dollars raised from the private sector . <p> Designed to recruit and train family day care providers , the Initiative works through existing nonprofit community-based child care resource and referral agencies ( R &Rs).; The Initiative funds selected R &Rs; to conduct a five-stage child care supply building process . The process involves assessing child care supply and demand and targeting needy areas ; recruiting people who have the potential to become licensed family day care providers ; training those people to deliver quality care and manage a small business ; providing technical assistance to help them obtain a license and begin operation ; and providing ongoing support to help them stay in business . <p> During the 12-month pilot ( October 1985 - September 1986 ) , six R &Rs; in five California counties successfully tested the Initiative 's supply building process . Pilot goals were exceeded by 20% with the licensing of more than 230 new family day care homes and the start-up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child care spaces were created in the program 's first year . <p> Early in the project 's development , The Ford Foundation supported a study which showed that approximately 70% of the providers recruited during the Initiative 's pilot year remained in child care . Impressed by this data , funders recognized that the Initiative project was more than just a good idea ; it had the staying power necessary to vastly impact the supply of child care . <p> The importance of having strong evaluation instruments for the Initiative can not be understated . Documentation of project outcomes and the project 's capacity to meet and exceed its goals have shown that child care can be expanded quickly in an orderly and organized fashion . Having an ability to prove that gives project sites and funders the assurance that they are supporting work that is as effective as it is important . It Is Community Based <p> Built on a foundation of state-funded resource and referral agencies , the Initiative works through an established , effective infrastructure . Primary responsibility for addressing child care needs is placed at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with hundreds of parents daily and understand what care is needed to meet parents needs . R &Rs; can tailor their activities to reflect local priorities and forge local partnerships to mirror the statewide Initiative . <p> These partnerships have demonstrated a capacity to create both local and statewide alliances of funder and volunteer involvement . They have helped communities build a long-term capability to meet child care needs . Supplementing the contributions of funders , community volunteer partners have supplied everything from public service announcements on local cable TV to accredited training classes at local community colleges . It is Replicable <p> Both the Network and the Ford Foundation recognized that the Initiative had a great potential for replication . Oregon and Michigan were identified as states with the necessary building blocks for spearheading their own versions of the Initiative . As child care professionals and policy makers in these states explored ways to remedy their particular child care needs , each looked to California 's success as holding promise for their state . With technical assistance provided by the Initiative , both the Oregon Child Care Initiative and Michigan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is Adaptable <p> Adaptations to the Initiative model have shown flexibility in meeting California 's changing child care needs . Activities in rural and Spanish-speaking communities and the recruitment and training of infant/toddler providers have demonstrated how the Initiative has been modified over the years . <p> In 1988 , four R &Rs; tested the Initiative model in rural areas and within an 18-month period recruited 177 providers , more than doubling their goal . Additionally , more than 1,000 new , potential and experienced providers participated in project workshops , classes and orientation sessions . New training materials and formats  --  including materials in Spanish and evening licensing orientations  --  were developed to respond to the special challenges of rural communities . <p> In 1992 , the increasingly pluralistic and multiethnic composition of California communities  --  in particular the growth in the Hispanic population  --  spurred a new direction in the Initiative 's focus . The Initiative added strategies and materials to meet the special challenges of building the child care supply in Spanish-speaking communities . These challenges included barriers to obtaining licenses , the lack of training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of existing training resources . The Initiative published a comprehensive set of culturally relevant Spanish-language recruitment and training publications that have been widely praised . <p> Most recently , in response to the critical shortage of high quality care for very young children , the Initiative launched a new partnership with Far West Laboratory . This partnership uses the Program for Infant/Toddler Care givers as a foundation and offers training for both newly recruited and existing providers who care for infants and toddlers . How It Works <p> Participating child care resource and referral agencies are required to raise 50% of their project funding locally from contributors , including city and county government , foundations , public agencies and businesses . The Initiative matches this money dollar-for-dollar up to $25,000 per project from the statewide Initiative Fund coordinated by the Network and administered by The San Francisco Foundation . R &Rs; are also required to build community-based partnerships with key public officials , community leaders , provider associations , licensing agencies and other organizations through in-kind and volunteer contributions . <p> Frequent training sessions and site visitations help the Initiative and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facilitate a two-way flow of information that helps shape the task at hand . <p> The Initiative also funds the California Child Care Resource and Referral Network to manage the Initiative 's day-to-day operations . The Network provides training and technical assistance to the R &Rs,; monitors and evaluates project outcomes and produces an integrated package of recruitment and training materials for providers and materials for the R &Rs.; The Future <p> By involving many stockholders and using a community-based approach , the California Child Care Initiative Project has demonstrated that a viable long-term solution to meet child care needs can be achieved without creating a large bureaucracy or seeking a massive infusion of government money . The project 's work has been acknowledged at several levels with honors and endorsements from such groups as the Kennedy School 's Center for Business and Government at Harvard University and the San Francisco Bay Area 's Business Leadership Task Force . <p> Yet there is still much work to do . Parents in many counties searching for child care find themselves on long waiting lists . The supply of affordable , quality child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 years of the California Child Care Initiative Project have been very encouraging . From a tiny pilot program that began in five counties , the Initiative has evolved into a program that has benefited providers , parents and children in California and border-to-border from Oregon to Mexico . <p> As the composition of neighborhoods and counties changes , the Initiative Project is dedicated to finding new ways to bring people into the field of child care and to keep them there . By doing so , the Initiative is striving to enhance the quality of life for all families . <p> By Jan Brown and Ted Lee <p> <p> Jan Brown is Program Manager of the California Child Care Initiative Project .

Located in each county , a resource and referral agency ( R &R); not only provides listings of licensed child care providers but engages in a wide range of activities from conducting provider training to maintaining a toy library for children . These agencies are actively involved with their communities through outreach and support programs and ideally act as one-stop centers for parents who have questions about any phase of child-rearing . <p> Funded by the state , these resource and referral agencies are all members of the California Child Care Resource and Referral Network . In addition to administering the Child Care Initiative Project , the Resource and Referral Network also helps manage a number of other programs , including Trustline , Title IV-A programs and the state 's Regional Market Rate Survey . The Network is an active advocate in state and local issues on behalf of its member agencies . <p> PUBLICATIONS OF THE CHILD CARE INITIATIVE <p> The California Child Care Initiative Project has made it a priority to ensure that quality materials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child care providers . <p> The Family Day Care Handbook ( 5th edition , 1992 ) is an anthology of articles that includes sections on getting started as a provider , the licensing process , the legal and business aspects of family day care , and health and safety issues .
