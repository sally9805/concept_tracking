At the club they said it was a match made in heaven . Cherisse was looking for a new roommate ( Yvana had moved out after a silly argument about some people 's elastic ideas concerning private property ) and this little sweetie was just as obviously looking for a room . Otherwise why would anyone choose the underside of Signora Pitti 's makeup table for sleeping quarters ? <p> Signora Pitti was n't pleased with the discovery , to say the least . Signora Pitti was the club 's grandest of the grand divas ( How many could present both a flawless Marlene Deitrich and a Marilyn Monroe even more credible than the original ? ) and God help anyone who forgot that ! Rage wants a target , and since no one could find the security guard whose job it was to exclude hoi polloi and importunate fans from backstage ( and certainly from beneath makeup tables ! ) there was only one possible victim for Signora Pitti 's nuclear hissy fit . <p> " Out ! " One huge , white-powdered hand pointed eloquently at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ served as punctuation . " Get out of here , you riffraff ! You troll ! You ragamuffin ! You  --  you  --  ! " <p> " Hush , Pitti , " Cherisse cut in . " Ca n't you see you 're scaring the poor child half to death ? " It had been no easy task to plow through the mob of performers ( agawk , agawk-o ) jamming the dressing room doorway , but this was Elbow-Fu in a worthy cause . One glimpse of the pitiful creature 's wide , limpid , terror-stricken eyes and Cherisse had no choice . <p> Of course there were the expected rumors . Everyone knew Cherisse was looking for a roommate just as much as the waif was looking for a room , but as to what else they both might be looking for ... <p> Cherisse heard the whispers all right . No sooner was the foundling shepherded out of Signora Pitti 's range and under Cherisse 's silk-draped wing but they began . They flew through the dressing rooms , airy as a flutter of gauze scarves , hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  so pretty . Just wants a little fixing up and  --  " <p> " Pretty ? Darling , that 's like calling the Titanic a dinghy ! I know gorgeous when I see it and I 'm telling you that child has got gorgeous to  --  " <p> "  --  tossed that little bit of flotsam up on our shores , I wonder ? " <p> " Oh , you know , the usual . There 's a broken heart for every light on Broadway . " <p> " Call this Broadway ? " <p> " Oh , shut up , Desiree . " <p> " A broken heart ? Hmph ! I 'll bet I know who did the breaking . Did you see those eyes ? Lashes out to there , and so thick  --  ! I tell you , it just is n't fair . " <p> " Do n't sulk , love . That 's why God made mascara . " <p> " Oh , get real . If a mascara wand came within five feet of those lashes I 'll eat it ! " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Bitch . " <p> " Tsk . Touchy , touchy . You 're just jealous because Cherisse pounced first . " <p> " Hunh ! Cherisse is welcome to the whole package , which includes an all-expense-paid trip to Dump City not too far down the road . I 'm telling you , and you can just write this down for posterity , as soon as something better comes along it 'll be Ciao , Cherisse , thanks so much for everything , now get the hell out of my way ! " <p> " You think so ? " <p> " Mhhmmm . That little number could n't find commitment in the dictionary , and Cherisse is no spring chicken . You know how it goes . " " Well , we certainly know how it goes for you , Desiree . " <p> And that was just in the first five minutes . The rumors continued for days , more tenacious than mildew and about as socially redeeming . By that time  --  days having passed , as already noted  --  Cherisse knew . <p> Knowledge  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cherisse did nothing to squelch the nastier remarks . No one would believe the truth for an instant , so why bother ? The whispers had one thing right , at any rate : The foundling was gorgeous . Drop dead gorgeous , no less . Perhaps that was where most of Signora Pitti 's ire had sprung from , sheer on-sight envy . Even without makeup , Zo was to die for . <p> " Zo ? " Cherisse had repeated that first night , casting one protective arm over those broad but slender shoulders as they left the still-raging diva 's dressing room . " Do n't you mean Zo-ee , dear ? " <p> " Zo . My name . " The voice was soft and sweet , even if the words came out with that odd , oh-so-fascinating stilted quality that hinted at foreign climes , tropic moons , and old Dorothy Lamour movies . " Is it  --  hokay ? " <p> " Okay , " Cherisse corrected , and since the revue was done for the night , took Zo off for something to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fries , two chocolate milkshakes , and threw up in the middle of the street outside the restaurant . Up until then , Cherisse 's plans had been limited to giving the poor creature a decent meal and then saying bye-ee . ( " Mother Theresa costumes do n't come in my size . " ) But standing there in the street , holding Zo 's heavy fall of gleaming black hair out of harm 's way , Cherisse was unexpectedly blindsided by the old **37;1176;TOOLONG ? feeling . Some might call it maternal instinct , though in Cherisse 's case ... <p> " You 're coming home with me , " Cherisse announced when the last of the burgers hit the asphalt , and that was that . <p> Three nights later , there was Cherisse and there was Zo , locked in the manager 's office for an hour . Dear old Gary , so straight you could use him for a ruler , was a businessman to the bone . He was n't about to give a job to something fresh off the street with  --  so far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks . Pretty ? The club had pretty faces to burn . Gorgeous ? That was another story , but one with the same ending . <p> " Look , Cherisse , the club 's got a reputation to keep up , you know that as well as I do . Our customers do n't just come here to goggle , they want to be entertained . Zo looks like a nice kid and all , but hey  --  ! The Salvation Army 's six blocks down , okay ? " <p> Those were his exact words . There were plenty of witnesses able to swear to that . While Cherisse went to the barricades for Zo , everyone else in the club just " happened " to have something intensely vital to do right outside Gary 's closed office door , and those who could n't come up with an excuse managed to drop contact lenses and earrings by the bushelful right there . Quel coincidence ! <p> That 's why there was also no end of honest folk able to testify to Gary 's Road-to-Damascus conversion . They all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not another word . You just listen . " Then there was a could-be-anything click which turned out to be the sound of a portable tape recorder being turned on . There followed the sound of the legendary Miss Judy Garland singing " Somewhere Over the Rainbow . " It was n't a very good tape . It was n't Judy as an adult , but as a child , dear Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz . In fact , it sounded as if Cherisse had taped the song from a television broadcast of the movie . Then a second click and silence . <p> And into the heart of the silence  --  and every other heart within hearing distance  --  a living voice raised in song . Outside the office door , the crowd traded startled looks that swiftly turned to ( often tearful ) expressions of rapture . <p> " Oh ... mah ... Gaard ! " <p> " That is perfect . That is just so perfect . " <p> " Sshh ! Gary 's saying  --  " <p> Everyone hushed in time to hear Gary say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrific . Zo was wonderful . Zo was ... well , a little frightening  --  perfection does tend to terrify the bravest soul  --  but what the hell , notify Wardrobe , someone stuff that kid into a costume , Zo could go on tonight . <p> " Does that mean you do n't want to hear the others ? " Cherisse asked him . <p> " Others ? " <p> Yes , there were others : Everything from Ethel Merman to Madonna , each as indistinguishable from the original as the Judy Garland . While Gary and the Ladies ' Quilting and Eavesdropping Circle beyond the door listened , Zo delivered performance after bravura performance . <p> " I discovered this  --  this outrageous talent by accident , " Cherisse explained . ( and if no mention was made about other discoveries ... be charitable ; call it an oversight . ) " We were back at my place , I was playing some old recordings while I hunted up clean sheets for the fold-out couch , and all of a sudden , what do I hear but this ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ran some videos , and take it from me , all the moves , all the mannerisms are just as perfect as the voice-thingie . " <p> " So I see . " Gary 's voice was that of a True Believer . " The kid 's a fuckin ' chameleon . " <p> " Please . " Zo 's original voice broke in . " What do you call me ? " <p> " Darling , do n't tell me you do n't know what a chameleon is ? " Cherisse was quick to supply the natural history lesson . " It 's a revolting little lizard that changes color to blend in with the background . Within reason . I mean , plaids are right out . " <p> " Ahhhh . For protection ? " <p> " The condom of the animal kingdom . " <p> There was a brief conversational parenthesis while Gary explained Cherisse 's joke , then Zo said , " So . Yes . It is good to be safe , for the babies . " <p> Gary was still laughing over that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> After Zo 's maiden performance , Signora Pitti opted for early retirement . In the new kid 's knife-edged shadow , the best Marlene and Marilyn would only look like half-assed parody . However , Gary stressed just how much a real trouper owes to loyal fans , so Signora Pitti compromised , converting what had once been a star turn into a comedy routine . <p> " They 're only going to laugh at me anyway , once they 've seen Zo , " the dethroned diva was heard to remark . <p> And so it was that after that night , the club split into two factions : Those who envied Zo and those who envied Cherisse . <p> There was absolutely nothing Cherisse could do or say to convince the latter that there was no cause for envy . None at all . No , really , none , because  --  <p> " She 's female . " Cherisse leaned into the glow of the makeup mirror , fiddling with a stroppy false eyelash . " I 'm telling you , she is one hundred percent female @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pitti , now performing under the name of Miss Pittipat ( and sharing the common dressing room ) , continued to fight the good fight with a substandard Cleopatra wig . " Why do n't you just tattoo the poor infant with a Hands Off sign ? It 'd be much subtler . " <p> " I 'm not kidding . Look , we live together . I 've seen things . " <p> " Well , so have I. " Miss Pittipat yanked the wig off and flung it to the floor , exasperated . " If my mama 'd ever had one of these the size of Zo 's , I 'd 've called her Daddy . " Those same formidable fingernails , now tinted pearly pink for comedy 's sake , touched the telltale bulge of cartilage just above the cheesy gilt pectoral ( Ancient Egyptian kitsch-on-a-budget R Us ) . " I mean , I 'm lucky ; mine 's not too big , but Zo  --  ! Apple my ass , that Adam 's got a fucking cantaloupe ! " <p> " Jealous , " Desiree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belief . " Listen , I do n't care if Zo 's got a bulge the size of  --  " <p> " I 'll bet . " <p> " Oh , shut up , Desiree . As I was saying before I was so rudely interrupted , all that Zo and I are to each other  --  all we can ever be  --  is roommates . That 's it . Nada mas . For the pure and simple reason that Zo is , by her own admission , female . Got it ? " <p> Miss Pittipat stroked Cherisse 's back and cooed , " There , there , darling , you do n't have to rationalize with us . We 're all getting older . We ca n't expect the young ones to look past the surface to the substance . So you made the move and you got the brashoff , been there , done that , bought the T-shirt . Bought the whole damn T-shirt company . You 'll find someone else . " <p> Cherisse 's scream was sheer reflex , heartfelt , and therefore tenor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said it in so many words ! She may be a little bit flaky  --  Christ knows , my finger was this close to dialing 911 after some of the other stuff she told me  --  but as far as this goes , I believe her , so why do n't you believe me ? I mean , why would anyone . want to lie about their sex ? " <p> The laughter that followed that unintentional sally did n't die down until Gary came storming into the dressing room and told everyone to put a sock in it . On reflection , this was n't such a fortuitious turn of phrase either , but at least they all stopped laughing at Cherisse . <p> Desiree spoke up after Gary left : " If Zo 's so female , then who was that nice Chinese gentleman I saw her with last night ? " <p> " What nice Chinese gentleman ? " Cherisse asked , a trifle wearily . <p> Desiree grinned . " Won Hung Lo . " <p> Miss Pittipat had pretty good reflexes or all the hours Desiree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have come to naught then and there . Though Cherisse struggled to give a healthy young right cross its freedom , the doughty ex-diva held both hands and insisted that the joke did n't merit fisticuffs . <p> " What joke ? " Desiree drawled . " The other night I came into Zo 's dressing room by accident  --  " <p> " Did n't you just . " Miss Pittipat could still deliver sarcasm capable of drawing blood . <p> "  --  and someone I could mention was n't in costume , " Desiree went on . " Just undies . " <p> " So of course you looked . " <p> " And you would n't ? " An expressive shrug dislodged a little of the glitter-laced powder sparkling on Desiree 's shoulders . " The last time I checked , I was n't dead . Well , let me tell you , if that 's how they 're building women these days , I may have to do a whole lot of rethinking about my lifestyle . And you know , I think those were just plain panties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only so much strain that ordinary nylon and elastic can take , something 's got ta give , and when it does  --  ! I am going to make a novena so that I am there for that coming-out party . " <p> " We get the idea , Desiree , " Miss Pittipat said , solid ice . " We can take a hint . " <p> But Desiree could n't . " That infant is carrying a concealed weapon . You know the saying , It 's got a mind of its own ? Darlings , what Miss Zo 's got tucked away ought to be in Mensa ! " <p> This time Miss Pittipat 's reflexes were just a skosh too slow to prevent the inevitable . Cherisse never took boxing in college , but enthusiasm often counts for more than expertise . Desiree caught air and made a three rhumba-ruffle landing against the far wall . That night , Carmen Miranda wore an extra layer of pancake and did n't need any rouge on one cheek . <p> Gary was summoned but met a brick wall when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Partial ignorance did n't stop him from dispensing punishment . Cherisse got suspended for a week , no pay , with the option to quit outright if there were any objections . <p> " As if I 'd object ! " Cold lager poured into the pilsner glass on the cafe table . Cherisse wrung the beer bottle 's neck without remorse , then set the drained corpse to stand with the ranks of its previously dispatched brethren . " Desiree 's right , you know : I 'm no spring chicken . I 'm a day too old to go making the rounds at other clubs . It 's not as if I were a celebrity like Miss Pittipat . I 'm just an old warhorse , and I can smell the gluepot from here . " The glass rose from the table full and returned almost empty . <p> Zo leaned across the table , eyes swimming with compassion . " This is all my fault . Yes . You keep my secret , you suffer . " <p> " Honey , I did n't keep your secret . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , natch . I 'm sorry , if that was supposed to be just between us  --  " <p> " Oh , that is no secret ! " Zo waved away Cherisse 's apology . " Anyone ask , I tell the same . But it is the other things I tell you . You do not tell them ? " <p> " Not a breath . " I have no desire to wind up in a strait jacket , thank you , they do nothing for my figure . <p> " So . Good . You are brave as well as beautiful . You would be a great warrior like me . " <p> " Thanks all the same , but  --  " <p> " And when there is the babies , I will make you co-mother , even if you have not killed anyone yet in battle . This is a great honor ; you have earn it by merit , if not by blood . " <p> Cherisse 's face went as white as the slowly ebbing foam in the pilsner glass . " Zo , think carefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " You know what babies . What I tell you when you first open your home to me , may the foremothers ' blessings attend you : The babies I come here to conceive , to bring into the light far from war , in all tranquility . " <p> " Oh yes , I remember . " I remember almost calling Bellevue . What war ? What foremothers ? Why me ? Oh God , I need another drink ! " Mmhm , sure , you did mention babies . In fact you seem to mention babies an awful lot , every chance you get , ever since you got here . You 're not  --  in trouble , are you ? " It would explain why Zo had gone to ground under that makeup table , and she was female ; she 'd said so . Cherisse also remembered how Zo 's first meal had made that messy curtain call in the middle of the street . It all fit . <p> Zo looked puzzled . " Babies are no trouble . " <p> " I would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be no trouble at all , once conceive . They will be our babies , dearling Cherisse ! " Zo 's innocent joy was a treat to see . <p> " Our babies , " Cherisse repeated , deadpan . " As in yours and mine ? Uh , I do n't think so , love . " <p> " Why not ? " <p> Cherisse explained . Zo nodded happily , then explained a few things back . Cherisse ordered a boilermaker . These were times that demanded more emotional fortitude than could be found in mere suds . Boilermakers needed no explanation . Boilermakers were Cherisse 's brand of Zen . <p> When the drink was history , Cherisse demanded , " You 're not still sticking to that story ? " <p> " What story ? " Zo 's legendary eyelashes fluttered . <p> " The one you handed me when I first brought you home . I mean , sweetheart , there 's no further need to lie to Auntie Cherisse ; you 're employed now . You have a roof over your head and food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay . You 're pulling your own weight . Hell , for the next week you 're pulling my weight too , as far as household expenses go . " Cherisse procured a second boilermaker . " I am not going to toss you out on your cute little heinie if you tell me who you really are . " <p> " I have ... mistaken ? " Zo 's delicate eyebrows made a common frown into a thing of beauty . " I thought I told you right , but  --  I do not use the right word ? Alien , yes ? Alien . Ohhhh ! No , wait , I know a better word , I hear it on television : Extraterresticle ! " She looked proud of herself . <p> While Cherisse choked on the half-inhaled boilermaker , Zo went on : " I know it is different for you . To be co-mother is just , ah , ceremonial name . Still , you will help me until they are born , you will help me after . My own birthing-mother says it is too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and our males are no help at such a time . They are only good for one thing , she says . " <p> " Your mother was a very wise extraterresticle , " Cherisse said , blotting up the last of the shpritzed beer and whiskey from the tabletop . " Okay , I give . God knows , I 've been trying to come up with some way to explain you that did n't involve Steven Spielberg , but when you add what you 've told me to what I 've seen  --  You know , sweetie , most earthlings do close the bathroom door  --  it 's just no use . My brain 's no more elastic than my thighs , more 's the pity , and I simply ca n't make it stretch to fit you . So fine , have it your way , you are not of this Earth . " <p> Zo leaned across the table and gently clasped Cherisse 's hand . " You are mad at me ? " <p> " No , baby . " <p> " Baby ! " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radiant smile . " Ohhh , Cherisse , just you wait until you see them , they are so cute when born , so small , and so many ! When the old ones tell me I am to be the vessel , the honor of it  --  ! It is because I extinguish myself in battle so nobly , hoping I will be chosen . I always want to have babies , this is why I kill so well . Very fiercely , almost as good as a male . All so I can be a mother . " <p> Zo chattered on , rhapsodizing about the glories of battle and the joys of maternity . Through a mental fog thickened by alcohol , Cherisse 's mind attached itself to only a few key words . <p> " How ... many babies was that ? " <p> " Fifty at least . Maybe more if I please my male . They fight well  --  all they would rather do is fight  --  but they do not like to do anything else . So me , a female , I must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet place where he can do some sex instead . How long it takes to get them to calm down and do something besides kill  --  ! " She clapped one hand to her forehead , a grand gesture copied chapter and verse from Miss Pittipat 's repertoire of vapors and fantods . " Some of them never want to sex . " <p> " Dear Lord , you are an alien , " Cherisse muttered . <p> " Males here are different ? " <p> " Let 's put it this way ... " Cherisse hated to quote Desiree , but it could n't be helped . " Have you ever heard the phrase It 's got a mind of its own ? " <p> " What does ? " Zo asked . Another explanation ( aided and abetted by another boilermaker ) and Zo said , " Ooooooh . " She clicked her tongue . " You are very lucky . Out males , like I say , they fight . This is one thing they are good for . " <p> " Pardon me , I thought  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are useful , not good . A big difference . They are so  --  cranky ? Bad tempers , and all those sharp things ! Teeth , claws , poison spit , and the stinger  --  ! " <p> " I do n't think I want to know where they keep that little accessory . " Cherisse shuddered . " Darling , if you do n't mind my saying so , your males sound so very , um , nasty-looking , but you 're so  --  so  --  " <p> " I drop dead being gorgeous , " Zo decreed . <p> Cherisse decided to let that pass . " What I 'm trying to ask is , could n't yOU girls do better ? " <p> " Not if we want the babies . " <p> A sigh reeking of boilermaker drifted over the table . " The things we do for love . " <p> " And sex , " Zo prompted . " Do not be forgetting sex . " <p> " I 'll make a note of it . " <p> " Good . Because once my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killing things , he should not be disturbed . They do not like to be interrupted once they , mm , catch on . " <p> " Trust me , honey , once your cranky little Casanova arrives , I 'll give the two of you all the privacy you can stomach . I have absolutely zero desire to get between Mr. Poison Spit and his happiness . Tell me , what does one wear to greet a groom-bearing spaceship ? " <p> " But he is  --  " said Zo . <p> " Of course it would n't be a big spaceship , would it ? Certainly not for your honeymoon . Do n't they always tell you girls that size is n't everything ; " The boilermakers had formed a workers ' cooperative with all of the previously ingested beers . Now they labored mightily together to eradicate all of Cherisse 's mental No One Likes a Motormouth signs . " And besides , if it were big , I do n't think it could touch down unnoticed anywhere around here . They 'd have to land in Jersey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington Bridge traffic is n't the anti-aphrodisiac of all time  --  ! " <p> " But we are  --  " Zo tried again . <p> " I mean , his ship has to be at least as small as yours , because here you are , sprung up in our very midst quiet as a dust bunny , no UFO reports on the tube , no special edition of Hardcopy , not even a plug on The X-Files  --  Say , is it just me , or does everyone think Fox Mulder is hot ? God , I hope it 's just me : Who needs the competition ?  --  but here you are anyway . Such a nice , quiet , discreet little alien . If that 's what you are . I mean , who 's to say ? I ca n't even make the rest of the girls believe you 're female , so why should I let you convince me you 're an ex  --  ex  --  " The boilermakers reached a unilateral decision to shut down a few collateral branches of Cherisse 's speech center , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  --  extraterestrogen ?

" <p> " But  --  " Zo was nothing if not determined . This time she was able to add , " But my mate  --  " <p> " Alien impersonators ! The new wave ! " Cherisse 's expansive gesture , meant to welcome the future , only succeeded in knocking a tray full of drinks from the grasp of a passing cocktail waitress . In the unavoidable aftermath It was a very tolerant bar as far as dress codes went , but the bouncer had no respect for how easily a silk dress can wrinkle ) it was Zo 's turn to hold Cherisse 's hair out of the way while the boilermakers , the beers and the sun all came up together . <p> That afternoon Cherisse awoke to find that the blessing of alcohol-induced amnesia had decided to take a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night before was sharp in memory . Zo said nothing about it , but Cherisse 's sense of guilt was the new , self-starting model . <p> " Sweetie , about last night  --  " Cherisse blushed , then winced with pain . The hangover gods had sent one of those exquisitely fine-tuned specimens that reacted to the slightest physical movement , even unto the vagaries of cheek capillaries . " I 'm  --  I 'm sorry for what I said about , um , for saying you 're not who  --  what you say you  --  Oh hell , I 'm just sorry I was such a jerk , okay ? I was drunk . That 's the reason , not an excuse . It 's just I 'm so upset about my suspension . I like what I do . I guess all those magazine articles were right . You know the ones , about how some men have no sense of identity beyond their jobs ? We are what we do . " <p> Zo clasped Cherisse 's hand . " You believe me ?

I mean , we Earthlings are programmed with certain ... expectations in that department : You 're not green . You 're not bug-eyed . And for the love of God , woman , what did you do with your tentacles ? " <p> Zo regarded Cherisse steadily and replied , dead serious , " Falsies .

In fact , when Cherisse finally did return to work , it was with a wonderfully satisfying sense of accomplishment . <p> " Not only did I catch up on the laundry , I got to go to the zoo , do a little shop-ping , and I finally taught Zo that we close the bathroom door when we 're using it , yes we do . Do you want to see the new shoes I  --  ? " <p> " Cherisse , Gary wants to see you in his office . " It was Mitzi , a.k.a. the Velveteen Vulture .

What the hell is this ? <p> " You and Zo , " Mitzi said , trying to look solemn and sympathetic . It was a botch job . <p> Cherisse went searching for Zo but could n't find her . Mitzi trailed along after , looking so pert and cheery and helpful that Cherisse wanted to take Mitzi and a box of Girl Scout cookies and  --  <p> " Get a hold of yourself , " Cherisse gritted , sotto voce . " There are some things a lady just does n't do . Not even to Mitzi . Not even with Do-Si-Dos . " <p> " Did you say something , honey ?

Wait a minute . " Cherisse went to the office door and checked outside for eavesdroppers . There were none ; it was too close to showtime , everyone was preoccupied with makeup and costumes .

" Desiree 's teeth flashed . " Her appearance . " <p> " Desiree tells me that Zo 's really a woman . " Gary looked apologetic , as if everything were his fault . <p> Cherisse 's eyebrows went up like the elevator at Bloomingdale 's . " That 's the problem ? " <p> " It is if you 're trying to pass yourself off as a drag queen , " Desiree sniped . " Victor/Victoria , my ass . Our customers wo n't stand for this kind of crap . " <p> " And have any of our customers complained ? " Cherisse spoke to Gary alone , giving Desiree the nuclear winter cold shoulder . <p> Desiree was frostproof . " You want to wait until they do ? This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back me on this , you 're the one who 's always talking about how we 've got a reputation to keep up . You know how fast word gets around ? " <p> " No faster than you , speaking of reputations , " Cherisse growled . <p> Desiree assumed a look of hauteur . " I take that remark whom whence it comes . Slut . " <p> Gary tried to regain control . " Look , Cherisse , I do n't have Word One to say against Zo , but Desiree does have a point : This is a drag club . We get a real woman on that stage , word gets out , we could get our asses sued for truth in advertising . You tell me there is n't some litigation-happy jerk out there who would n't do it ! Desiree tells me you 're the one who said Zo 's a woman in the first place . Is that the truth ? " <p> Cherisse remembered the last time Zo had forgotten to close the bathroom door . Cherisse had been in a hurry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't believe in closed shower curtains either . <p> " Zo is definitely not a woman , " Cherisse declared . No more than a mare or a hen or a cow or any female not of the human species . It 's not a lie , it 's linguistics . <p> At that moment , the office door opened . Preceeded by eight inches of bouffant wig , Mitzi peered around the edge and announced , " Knock , knock ! Here she is ! Got ta run ; I 'm on in five . " The wig popped out of sight and Zo swept into the room . <p> She was dressed for the stage as the legendary Marilyn Monroe , wearing the halter-dress which that icon ( and a subway grate ) made famous in The Seven Year Itch . She looked absolutely aglow with happiness . Without a nod or word of greeting for Gary or Desiree , she flew into Cherisse 's arms . <p> " Finally , finally he has decide he loves me ! " she cried . " It is all going so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , he lets me know he wants me to go outside , into the alley , and there it begins ! " <p> " In the alley , " Desiree repeated , chewing over every syllable to extract the last bit of juicy goodness . " My , my , Princess Di , I have n't seen you since finishing school . " <p> Cherisse pushed Zo to one side and surged for Desiree , who squeaked and ducked behind Gary . " Just one clear shot , that 's all I want ! Just one , and I do n't care if you fire me after ! " Cherisse suited the action to the words , but Desiree bobbed out of the way . " You think I do n't know your game ? With Miss Pittipat doing comedy , all you need is to get rid of Zo so you can take the star spot ! " <p> " Or you could , sweetie . " Desiree blew a kiss . " Love your Lassie . " <p> Cherisse started around the desk , fists ready . Desiree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Gary made all sorts of shooshing , pacifying noises and gestures at the enraged Cherisse , none of which did a tinker 's damn of good . Zo stood all alone , hands pressed to her mouth , in an agony of distraction . <p> " Oh my goodness , Honored Co-mother , what is all this ? " <p> " Do n't worry , Zo dear , " Cherisse said grimly , still closing in on Gary and Desiree . " I 'm only going to kill Desiree . New York State waives the death penalty for bitchicide . " <p> " So ? I can kill this one for you if you want , I can do it fast and easy , leaving no drops that spot , but  --  but any sudden moves would disturb - Oh dear  --  And they do get so cranky if  --  Just the worst temper you could ever  --  oh dear , oh dear , what to do , what to do ? " <p> While Zo dithered , Cherisse 's advance had moved Gary and Desiree all the way around to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one shoulder at that portal to safety , the office door . The only thing in the way was little Zo . Taking a deep breath , Desiree shoved Gary mightily , right into Cherisse 's arms . Equally taken by surprise , the two of them went crashing to the floor while Desiree made a break for it  --  <p>  --  and in mid-break suffered a change of mind . " I 'm settling this once and for all ! " With astonishing deftness , Desiree grabbed Zo 's arm and twisted it behind her back with one hand , getting a headlock on her with the other . Zo gave a half-choked cry of distress and tried to writhe free , but Desiree countered her every move . " You 're not the only one who took self-defense at the Y , darling , " Desiree hissed in her ear . <p> " Zo , for God 's sake , you 're a trained soldier ! Fight back ! " Cherisse yelled , struggling to get off the floor . The new shoes did n't help . One heel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cherisse hit the dirt once more . <p> " I can not ! " Zo wailed . " To do it is too  --  is too violence ! It takes me so long to get him in the mood , I will have to star all over , and then the babies  --  " <p> Her words reached Desiree as just so much gibberish . People with their own agendas generally suffer from selective deafness . " Either she 's a woman or you 're a liar ! " Desiree shouted at Cherisse . " There 's just one way to prove which , and I 'm going to do it now ! " <p> There being no subway grate to provide a handy updraft , Desiree dropped the armlock , dropped the headlock , and before Zo could react , yanked up her dress . <p> " Whoa ! " said Gary , staring at what lay revealed . He sounded more envious than amazed . " Sorry , Desiree , but from the look of that , I 'd say Zo 's got every right to keep working here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working here ! " Zo cried , unsuccessfully trying to jerk the skirt out of Desiree 's grip . " Not after this . All is still quiet , but oh , what harm you might have done ! " She glowered at Desiree . " I must go now , now , before you do disturb him ! " <p> " Oh , lighten up , sweetie , " Desiree sneered . " If you ask me , the only thing disturbed around here is  --  " <p> It was a sentence destined to die unfinished , cut off in its prime by a loud , distinct , resounding *SNAP ! * <p> Desiree had been right : There was just so much strain ordinary nylon and elastic could take . Zo 's flimsy unmentionables gave way at the waistband and plummeted ankleward . Zo 's squeal was so inarguably feminine that Gary automatically clapped his hand over his eyes and averted his gaze , despite what he had just seen . Not so Desiree , who bent over for a good , close look at  --  at  --  <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peeved by a heavy-thumbed butcher . Still clinging to the upflung skirt , eyes up close and personal , Desiree stared at Zo 's really unmentionable and declared , " That 's not a  --  ! " <p> Which was all Desiree got to say in the matter . Apparently the sudden draft counted as a disturbance . The source of Zo 's much-envied bulge uncurled itself from its snug harbor at the base of her abdomen and fixed Desiree with a narrow , orange stare . <p> It was small , but it made up for it by being ugly . A crest of shiny spines slowly stood up straight along its backbone . A tiny mouth opened to astonishing proportions to bare a double row of just-as-astonishing fangs . A low , warbling growl welled up from its throat as slim , wicked claws unhooked themselves from Zo 's flesh . <p> " Now , now , dearling , do not be  --  " Zo crooned one heartbeat before the creature launched itself straight for Desiree . <p> " They never listen , " said Cherisse wearily , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of assorted chaos afterwards , when Zo had finally recaptured her mate with a combination of feminine wiles and an upended wastebasket , she turned sorrowful eyes to Cherisse . ( Gary was busy applying long-disused Boy Scout first aid skills to Desiree 's face . Unless he 'd earned a merit badge in plastic surgery , it was a lost cause . ) <p> " Now you will betray us , " she said . " You will call your  --  your authorities , yes ? We will fight . We must . And we will die . There will be no babies . " <p> " Angel , the only authority that 's going to see you is the Port Authority . " Cherisse spoke with assurance . " You tuck your hubby back into your undies and get on the first bus to anywhere , okay ? We 're not going to say anything until you 're gone . " <p> " Va hell ve 're nod ! " Desiree gurgled from under several pounds of cotton wool . <p> " Oh , shut up before someone ties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You brought this on yourself and you know it . But if you want to call up the F.B.I . with some story about people with aliens in their panties , do n't let me stop you . I mean , you look like such a reliable witness . " <p> " Oong . " Desiree subsided . <p> " Good choice , " said Gary . <p> Zo threw her arms around Cherisse . " How can we ever thank you ? " <p> " Go to Newark , have lots of babies , and do n't invade Earth later on , " Cherisse replied . " Oh , and buy a better grade of underwear . " <p> Zo gave them all one last , dazzling smile , stowed a still angrily chittering male of the species somewhere beneath her dress , and vanished from Gary 's office , the club , and Cherisse 's life . <p> Cherisse sighed . " Well , gentlemen , " he said , turning to Gary and Desiree , " I trust that we have all learned a little something from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inquired . <p> " Do n't buy cheap underwear ? " Gary asked , a tad more articulately . <p> " No , love . " Cherisse smiled fondly at the club manager . " Sometimes it really does have a mind of its own . " <p> <p> By Esther M.
