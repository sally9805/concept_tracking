Harry Thomason and Linda Bloodworth-Thomason , you will recall , are the very rich television producers ( Designing Women , Evening Shade ) who caused a stir during the early days of the Clinton Administration on account of their close friendship with the President and his wife and their constant presence at the White House . Washington has changed considerably since then : the Thomasons have been swept out of town ( or at least out of sight ) and the Republicans have swept in . All of which may have sharpened the Thomasons ' sense of outrage but not their satirical skills . <P> Women of the House , the couple 's new sitcom that debuts this week on CBS , stars Delta Burke as Suzanne Sugarbaker , the character she played on Designing Women . Suzanne has come to Washington to take over the congressional seat of her late husband . The show aims to update Mr. Smith Goes to Washington : the heroine is a naive ex-beauty queen from Georgia who does n't know the difference between columnist William Safire and Sapphire , her maid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the capital 's sophisticates . <P> Despite the setting , the Thomasons seem less interested in political satire than in replicating Designing Women . Suzanne 's staff is another kaffeeklatsch of man-abused females : a spacy receptionist left by her husband ( Valerie Mahaffey ) ; a boozy press secretary fired by the Washington Post ( Teri Garr ) ; and a hard-boiled chief aide ( Patricia Heaton ) embittered because the Congressman whe worked for ( " the man I served ... under for 14 years " ) is now in prison and his wife is getting all the conjugal visits . <P> The political wisecracks are mostly on the level of bad Jay Leno . Suzanne appears on TV in a revealing dress , and someone comments , " I have n't seen a pair of boobs like that since Haldeman and Ehrlichman . " All too often the producers  --  who were openly angry about the way they were treated in Washington  --  seem to be settling a personal score . When Suzanne , for example , wants to invite some of her show-business friends to a dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We should be inviting people of quality and distinction  --  not tan , happy people from Hollyood . " <P> The Thomasons ' status as Washington insiders has not helped them unlearn years of bad sitcom habits . In one episode Suzanne is invited to spend the night in the White House . She gets so excited that she jumps up and down on the bed in the Lincoln Bedroom and breaks it . To repair the damage , her staff sneaks into the White House carrying a new footboard disguised as a huge painting of a naked man . By the time Jamie Farr ( Corporal Max Klinger from M*A*S*H ) shows up in a dress , you just want to send these tan , happy people back to Hollywood where they belong .
