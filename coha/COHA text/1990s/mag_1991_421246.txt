<p> Bonnie Sklarski presents land developments , housing complexes , and electric plants in her paintings in order to address their potential damaging impact on nature . <p> NATURE COMES FIRST in Bonnie Sklarski 's paintings of figures in the landscape . The people she depicts seem to have an uneasy , almost adversarial relationship with the land around them , and with titles such as Land Developers , Housing Development , and Electric Plant , her paintings specifically address the encroachment of artificial , man-made , often damaging influences into nature . This tension between man and nature permeates her work , and it 's clear that although she has spent years learning to paint the figure , it 's nature that has her greatest respect . <p> She says , " My philosophy of painting is that you have a basic , innate idea about what gives you the most pleasure  --  what you think about as opposed to what you should think about . There 's something that permeates one 's consciousness ; for me , it 's the awe I felt for the mysteries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my childhood . I used to go to the woods just to think . I 'd watch minnows or crayfish or birds and , before I knew it , I was caught up in the drama and the spectacle of the natural world . rid . The sounds I heard , many of which I associated ' with Native Americans and other early civilizations , and the smell of the fields triggered all kinds of questions in my mind that I 'm still trying to answer now . My paintings start on that level  --  with a basic sense of nature  --  and move toward my anxiety about civilization . " <p> Sklarski 's previous paintings showed early man in the wilderness , but her goal now is to discuss what modern man is doing to the landscape . " My paintings present man and nature ( Man and Nature ' is actually the name of the series ) in a manner that shows how man has manipulated nature , " she explains . " My original plan was to start with early man and move through the agrarian revolution , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've jumped a few steps because of how deeply I feel about the encroachment of modern man upon nature . " <p> The foreground of Sklarski 's paintings is what might be called the wilderness section . It 's isolated and lonely , and the figures in it seem out of place . The backgrounds show civilization and its effects . Land Developers presents a group of figures standing on a small island rising out of a river that flows through a canyon . One man is holding blueprints . On the ground near them are crushed pieces of skeletons and pottery shards . Sklarski says , " I 'm trying to get across the idea that they 're standing on civilization but at the same time are oblivious to it . They are examining blueprints with the intent of developing the area ; they have no regard for the local animals and past civilizations . " Similarly , in Electric Plant there are two figures in the foreground  --  right in the middle of nature  --  who are reading and listening to music from a boom box , ' completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electric plant looms in the distant background . <p> Housing Development is a twilight scene with a female figure in the foreground . It 's jot clear if the scene is an environment in the figure 's dream or it 's her reality . Whereas in the background of one of Sklarski 's usual landscapes we might see hazy mountains , this background reveals a suburban housing development . The intrusiveness of the buildings is glaringly clear . <p> Sklarski 's love for both art and nature beganin Elma , New York , a suburb of Buffalo , where she was born in 194 . " There was never an issue about my being an artist , " she says . " Everything I did in my life led me to art . I 've always drawn and painted . I grew up in the country , surrounded by lots of woods , creeks , arid fields , and when I was n't looking at the landscape , I was drawing or painting it . " <p> Sklarski graduated from the Pratt Institute in New York City in 1965 , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , " salvaged skeletons and plaster casts and emulated the old drawing methods . " Continuing her education in New York City , she received an M.F.A. degree in 1970 from Brooklyn College . She trained with Gabriel Laderman and Alfred Russell at Brooklyn College and with , Walter Erlebacher , who she say was her mentor . <p> After completing her formal training , Sklarski continued her art education unusual ways . She studied geology and chemistry in order to have a deeper practical understanding of nature . She also explored human anatomy intensively , taking gross anatomy with the advanced students at the University of Indiana . When I was an undergraduate , there were no anatomy courses for art students and my figure drawing really suffered , " she comments . " So I taught myself anatomy , and I studied with Walter Erlebacher , who taught classes from his home . Then , when I started working at the University of Indiana . I met Dr. Sherwin Mizell , the head of the anatomy section , who allowed me to study with his students . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work to get figures into my paintings . " The anatomical renderings in her current show are the ones the did during her studies of gross anatomy . <p> Sklarski now teaches anatomy for art students and portraiture at the University of Indiana , where she is a professor of art . Her anatomy course is a very intense one in which she lectures on the bones , the artistic characteristics of muscles , the actions of the body , and the movements of joints . She says , " Learning anatomy either makes people very picky and encourages their already-present tendencies toward exact , tight rendering of muscles and bones or it becomes a release for people who need a knowledge of structure to understand the form . " <p> In her portraiture class , Sklarski teaches her own approach to art , using techniques she has found effective . She feels that the act of preparing for classes has been a learning experience for her . " If I were n't teaching , " she says , " I would n't be asking myself awkward questions about painting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own technical knowledge of painting and drawing much stronger . " <p> In her portrait course , Sklarski concentrates on how to effectively use the earth palette , breaking down the processes of paint application , underpainting , and glazing into what she calls the English and the French methods . In the English method , the underpainting is built up with Indian red , ivory black , and white , and then warm colors are glazed on . The French method relies on grays or browns built up with lights and darks . The English method looks more red as an underpainting . Sklarski is currently working in the English method . " It keeps my flesh tones more lively . " she says . " If I start off using browns and grays , it 's hard for me to get them to come alive , to bring them back up to a luminous state . They tend to stay on the dark side . The red underpainting imparts a heavy pink tone , but toning that down is easier than bringing up brown or gray . " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind and how it 's reflected on the figure . <p> To teach her students about light , Sklarski has her students begin with self-portraits , which they concentrate on for a very long time . As she puts it , " Once you get the idea of how the underpainting works , you can use that technique on the whole figure  --  the model , that is  --  if you have the drawing skills . When doing a self-portrait , students closely scrutinize the forms and the way that light falls on those forms . But when depicting a model , the artists stand some distance away and often feel self-conscious about scrutinizing , especially if they are inexperience . I find that doing self-portraits over and over again really works for studying light effects , particularly if the student has a good drawing background . " <p> As is consistent with someone who spends so much time learning about the structure of things  --  both internal and external  --  Sklarski prefers to work directly from life : " Lighting effects , structural ideas  --  everything has to come from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea , I spend a great deal of time ( maybe too much ) in the studio working and getting the feel of the piece just right . Then I concern myself with procedure . All of my work is underpainted and heavily glazed in an attempt to bring out the luminosity of the canvas , an effect that I ca n't achieve If I work opaquely . I normally use Winsor &; Newton oil colors , but I also like Schminke ; I usually use sable brushes . " <p> Sklarski likes using earth tones for self-portraits since they produce naturalistic effects . She notes that most students are very eager to use cadmium colors , but as soon as they do , they realize how much more harmonious and fleshlike the earth colors are . " It 's a real lesson about the fact that it 's what you put around colors that makes them show up , rather than the inherent brightness of the colors themselves , " she says . <p> " When I 'm doing a highlight on a check , " Sklarski continues , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the most luminous part . The I take it an sully it with a little ivory black or raw umber . This becomes the color next to the highlight . the pure Indian red and white mixture looks incredibly vibrant next to the sullied color around it , which works as a shadow . In a case such as this , you really begin to appreciate the power of neutral colors as compared to the more chromatic ones . For example , muted green works well for the shadows around the moth and lavender works well for the bags under the eyes . Then pinks on the cheeks are used to intensify brighter colors . Bright with dull makes bright look brighter . This method works . " <p> According to Sklarski , some students really flourish with this method , and their paintings improve rapidly . Others get caught up with the neutral colors and , consequently , their paintings become very brown and dreary . " That 's always a danger , " she points out . " Although I advocate using neutrals , you have to learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult lesson for some people . " <p> In her own work , the biggest problem for this articulate artist is how to use the figure to express the things she finds most meaningful without making her paintings seem corny . " The way we regard nature is the thing that 's had the most profound effect on me , " she says , " and is therefore what I want my paintings to reflect . I 'm constantly searching for a way in which my thoughts will make sense to other people . Because my work does not fit into the mainstream very easily and does not look like people have trouble categorizing it . Someone once said that it was difficult to tell if my paintings depicted things before or after the bomb . " The underlying tone of solitude and desolation that one can feel in Sklarski 's work shows that her thoughts are coming through . <p> Sklarski says , " The first look at a finished painting usually tells me the truth about what I am doing . By the emotional response that a painting gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oriented . It took years of studying geology , anatomy and plant forms for me to reach the point where I can put them together in my paintings . Now , I attempt to combine my knowledge of nature with my anxiety about the future of the earth . In the end , it comes down to the basic love you have for something , and everything else builds on that . " <p> Sklarski has just completed her fourth solo exhibition , which ran from September 8 to October 10 , 1990 , at the Robert Schoelkopf Gallery in New York City . <p> There are several anatomy texts that Sklarski recommends for her class : The Human Figure  --  an Anatomy for Artists , by David K. Rubins ( Penguin ) ; Atlas of Human Anatomy for the Artist , Stephen R. Peck ( Oxford University Press ) ; Artistic Anatomy , by Dr. Paul Richer , edited by Robert Beverly Hale ( Watson-Guptill ) ; Living Anatomy  --  A Photographic Atlas of Muscles in Action and Surface Contours , by R.D.

To bring out the color of the mouth , nose , and ears , Sklarski uses a thinned burnt sienna intensified with alizarin crimson or scarlet . She then washes a mixture of yellow and a little white into the orange regions to bring the complexion to life . By repeatedly applying glazes after allowing the last layer to dry , Sklarski is able to build up a luminous flesh tone . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : The completed painting : Self-portrait in Black , 1989 , oil , 20 x 16 . <p> BY GAIL S.
