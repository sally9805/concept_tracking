TIME is read not only in the U.S. but also by millions of people overseas . So , how does one adapt a quintessentially American newsmagazine for the rest of the world ? The process is both Herculean and alchemical , involving such minutiae as the transmutation of impenetrable Americanisms and the replacement of American measures with metric , as well as the production of entire sections and cover stories that speak specifically to Asia , Europe , Latin America , Canada and Australia . <P> Each week a staff of 32 based in New York City works with our 19 bureaus around the world to shape stories , cull pictures and lay out the pages for the fraternal twin of the U.S. edition . With a circulation of 1.5 million , TIME International produced 1,500 pages on its own last year , including 37 cover stories . It has , in short , become a magazine in its own right  --  and as such it needs the editorial organization that will ensure its further growth and vitality . Effective this week , Karsten Prager becomes managing editor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , assistant managing editor . <P> Born in the East Prussian capital of Konigsberg ( now Kaliningrad in the Soviet Union ) , Prager went to the U.S. as a student before embarking on a journalistic career that included long stints in Southeast Asia , where he covered the Vietnam War , and in the Middle East , where he was one of the first Western journalists , in 1975 , to interview Saddam Hussein . <P> Ferrer joined TIME in 1963 and soon earned a reputation as one of the magazine 's masters of editing . It is a talent he has shared generously over the years , leading many a neophyte writer through the intricacies and nuances of his craft . Says one writer : " Even when you think there is n't room to improve a story , Joe can make it better . " Since overseeing TIME 's coverage of the 1988 Olympics , Ferrer has worked closely with Prager in nurturing TIME International 's growth as well as managing the complex logistics of 10 different editions each week . <P> " It 's been a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1973 , " says Prager . " But the process does not stand still . We want to make this magazine as international as possible without losing sight of the fact that it is by birth an American creation . " With Prager and Ferrer at the helm , TIME International will assuredly not stand still .
