Walks on the Wild Side <P> A long-distance walk for a worthy cause is hardly a new idea , but Kenyan Michael Werikhe has taken the concept to new lengths . Over the past eight years , Werikhe , 33 , has trekked thousands of miles across Africa and Europe to raise money to save the black rhino , one of the world 's most endangered species . <P> Elephant tusks , rhino horns and leopard skins confiscated from poachers were a common sight in the " ivory room " of the Kenyan Game Department 's Mombasa office , where Werikhe used to work . But a pair of 50-kg ( 110-lb. ) tusks brought in one day by a game warden induced him to start his one-man crusade . " Being an African , I see wildlife as part of my heritage , " Werikhe says . " If wildlife goes , then part of me is dead . I wanted to campaign for wildlife in my own private way . " <P> On his first wildlife walk , in 1982 , Werikhe traveled 2,400 km ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kenya to Dar es Salaam , Tanzania , and back to Mombasa , with only a pet python named Survival for company . Lecturing to villagers and schoolchildren , he raised about $30,000 for conservation groups . In 1988 Werikhe went to Europe , covering 2,900 km ( 1,800 miles ) in 135 days , and collected almost $1 million for rhino sanctuaries . Partly as a result of Werikhe 's efforts , Kenya 's black rhino population  --  once as low as 400 animals  --  has been slowly increasing since 1988 . When Werikhe is not on one of his journeys , he works as superintendent of security at an auto plant . He plans to walk across the U.S. later this year and hopes to eventually visit the Far East , where most rhino horn and elephant ivory are sold . <P> Blocking Bulldozers in Tasmania <P> Like St. Paul on the road to Damascus , Dr. Bob Brown had a sudden and irrevocable conversion . The Australian general practitioner had traveled for twelve days on the Franklin River , a beautifully remote waterway in western Tasmania , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headwaters , he heard the racket of construction equipment  --  jackhammers , drilling barges , bulldozers and helicopters . They were about to build a dam that would have destroyed everything Brown had just seen . " I decided on the spot that the preventive medicine I should be involved in was the conservation movement , " says Brown , 45 . He dropped his medical practice and joined the Tasmanian Wilderness Society , which had taken on the state power commission in what became Australia 's biggest environmental battle . <P> " Saint Brown , " as he is known by his opponents , became Australia 's most notorious environmentalist . During the seven-year battle to save the river , he was robbed , shot at and set upon by thugs . The mailbox of his spartan weatherboard cottage was stuffed with animal entrails . But his soft-spoken message of peace and planetary conservation prevailed , and the dam was scuttled in 1983 . Briefly jailed for barring the path of a bulldozer , Brown was elected to the Tasmanian parliament the day after his release  --  one of five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Australia 's smallest state . Today he speaks out regularly on such issues as nuclear disarmament and the dangers of a runaway greenhouse effect . " This is an intellectual and emotional revolution , " says Brown . " If we do n't have a future , then we have n't got a present . " <P> Snorkeler Saves a Rare Reef
