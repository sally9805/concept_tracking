THURSDAY HERE I AM UP IN THE AIR HIGH above California . I am in a tiny little Embraer regional aircraft flown by American Eagle . In the row ahead of me is a woman with a small child who is crying as if the devil was coming after her . But I mean really , really , SCREAMING . Like a madwoman . Or a mad child . Just going crazy . The mother , a psycho with tattoos and a T-shirt that says , in Magic Marker , " GO AHEAD AND STARE ! " has no clue about how to quiet a crying baby . She is not offering her food , milk , soothing , nothing . She told me she and her daughter had been flying all day from Ft . Lauderdale and had missed a flight and the daughter was exhausted . Also , the daughter is sneezing and coughing . I am just a few inches away from this tyke . Naturally , about 10 minutes before landing in Fresno , the kid fell into a deep sleep . The mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bother you too much , " said the witch . What ? How on earth could it not have bothered me to have a wildly screaming baby in front of me ? However , in my new calm incarnation , I just thought , there is a lesson here . The kid was obviously exhausted . None of us should allow ourselves to get too exhausted , or otherwise our inner baby starts to shriek in fear or anger or depression . Off in a nice little Town Car to my Hilton Homewood Suites Hotel in Fresno . Not my usual . No room service . But they did bring me a toaster , a loaf of bread , butter , and orange juice , so I am happy . I got a driver to take me over to the International House of Pancakes . I had dinner with myoid pal , the beautiful Tami , and her sweet little daughter , Savannah Suzieray . Good pancakes . Good orange juice . Then we met Tami 's parents , lovely fine people . Then I watched Tropic Thunder in my hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I like this Hilton . It is quiet and the bed is comfy and I like my toaster a lot . FRIDAY OFF FOR LUNCH AT Marie Calender 's at a shopping center in Fresno . My companions were Tami and Savannah Suzieray . I had never been to Marie Callender 's . I had turkey and stuffing . It was amazingly good and very cheap . This will be a new destination for my eating pleasure . Then a very short nap and off to speak at Fresno State . I had a short meeting with some sweet , smart young students , all of whom seem to want to do good works and work for government or the nonprofit sector . ( I guess the whole economy is a nonprofit sector now . ) Then a reception with a group of faculty , administrators , and donors . I talked to each of them . Many of them talked about what a terrible water shortage the growers of California face . It is terrifying . I think they should be having major desalination of ocean water , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I guess it will eventually have to happen . California without water is just a temperate wasteland . Desalination or desalinization seems an inevitable part of life for California . Anyway , the people at Fresno were just delightful . Fresno is basically a small farming city and has friendly , small-town qualities . I liked it a lot , but then I rarely go to any part of America I dislike . My speech went very well , and the kids were delightful . There were many questions , ranging from serious issues about bank capitalization to whether pot should be legalized to help the California budget deficit . ( My view : no . It is way too powerful to be legalized . But then , come to think of it , so is gin . ) Then , off in the Lincoln Town Car , driven by my trusted driver , Milky Imtaz of Bangladesh . That car is my real home . We headed back to L.A. Three and a half hours through the night . I slept the whole way . I love sleeping in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a kiss on my sleeping wife 's lips , a long swim , and then a sleep in my bed with my beloved dogs , Brigid and Cleo . This is my life . I love it . I do not want to catch that kid 's cold though . Or TB , or whatever it is . I actually just want to sleep . FRIDAY HERE I AM IN SPARTANBURG , South Carolina . I know this area of the world a bit because our son , the redoubtable Tommy , used to go to school near here in Clinton , South Carolina . At Presbyterian College , if you recall . There is a huge BMW plant here and lots of other automotive and high-tech entities . Naturally , they are all suffering right about now . Still , my hotel is charming . I arrived here after a long drive from the Charlotte airport in a fancy but low-slung BMW sedan . We stopped at the Waffle House in Blacksburg , South Carolina . A very drunken black " " You Jewish , right ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black , " he said , and went back to his meal . I was n't quite sure of the point , but he had a likable quality anyway . In my hotel lobby was a group of young black men . They came over to me for photos and autographs . They were , as it turned out , a " step dancing " team from a predominantly black college called Johnson Smith . I actually had heard of it because I have been a donor to the United Negro College Fund for many , many years . Now it seems , these young men had just been in a step competition and had come in second . Two of them showed me their steps . They were amazingly good . Just fantastic . And they were so happy that I videotaped them and applauded that I was deeply touched . I could not do that kind of thing in a billion years . I went to my room and watched a strange Spanish movie about a crazed Spanish policeman who falls in love with a beautiful prostitute , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentally retarded brother to be killed and then acts retarded himself so the prostitute will fall in love with him as she had with his retarded brother . It was a VERY dark movie but somehow moved right along and left me thinking . The human animal is extremely far from perfect . And believe me , I am in that VERY far from perfect group . You can not quite imagine how far . But anyway , just remember I never claimed to be anything but a highly flawed being . SATURDAY A super-interesting day . I went on a tour of a breast cancer detection center at the Spartanburg Regional Medical Center . It was named for Drs . Josey and Bearden , two fine fellows who did major work to help out with breast cancer in the greater Spartanburg area . It was given with the help of some kind local donors , including a couple named Gibbs , whose wife greeted me very cheerily , and the absent but very charming Mr. Roger Milliken , about whom more later . The center was super advanced and showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot about breast cancer . I also learned that both Drs . Josey and Bearden had families who had been in South Carolina since the 1760s and ancestors who had been doctors in the Civil War . Very impressive . Then a rest , and then a reception with poohbahs and others connected with the Spartanburg Regional Medical Center . A good-looking , very polite , and pleasant group . Not a bad-acting fellow among them . One of the attendees was Roger Milliken . Now , get this : Roger Milliken is the patriarch of an extremely important family that owns a huge textile entity called Milliken &; Company . Mr. Milliken is about 90 . Courtly , handsome , intelligent . About 53 years ago , my socially prominent and lovely friends the Sculls took me from Maryland up to Maine to see a beautiful area called Mount Desert Island and Northeast Harbor . They brought me to the home of an old pal of Mr. Scull , the self-same Roger Milliken . He was then about 35 and looked like the embodiment of a perfect gentleman . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Milliken makes carpets , but I think these were oriental carpets , though I maybe mistaken . ) Is that a small world or what ? I gave a speech after the reception and it went well . I forgot to tell you I also posed for photos . That is standard . Anyway , I really , really liked Spartanburg . I think I have told you before how much I like South Carolina and how genteel the people there are . Back to my room but way too tired to watch my Spanish mystery story again . SUNDAY Here i am in my apartment at the Watergate . Did I tell you I bought a second apartment here ? I am not sure why I did . Call it insanity , as you can call so much of what I do . It is in the same building as the dwelling of Irving Kristol and Gertrude Himmelfarb . My view is breathtaking . I have it fairly well furnished . My " thing " is that I just lie in my immense bed and look out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the airplanes coming into Reagan . I really love doing that . I am just happy being in that spartan room with its windows looking out at the sky . Naturally , I have lost my shirt on the investment . Naturally , I would do it again . WEDNESDAY On t ? Lansing , Michigan , to speak to a well-run insurance company called Jackson National . We are actually customers of theirs . Lansing is a bit dreary but my hotel , a Sheraton , was fine . Room was way too small but the hotel restaurant was fabulously good . It is called Christie 's and it may be the best hotel food I have ever had . FRIDAY Two speeches in one day to the nice insurance people . Tiring , but as my pal Michael Chinich says , " Better to be overwhelmed than unemployed . " They really were the salt of the earth . One of the executives told me a story about kidnapping in L.A. that scared me to death . Otherwise fine except I have a nagging fear and terror about money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But as Holly Martins , the hero of The Third Man , says , " I ca n't be sensible . I do n't have a sensible name . " Wait , I do have a sensible name . Never mind . But I am very worried about my future . I can not believe I have been as imprudent as I have been . I am old now and what will I do ? I am so used to having a comfortable life . What will it be like when I am no longer able to justbuyanythingIwant ? Well , Idon'tmeanBentleys . I mean waffles . I told you , I ca n't be sensible .
