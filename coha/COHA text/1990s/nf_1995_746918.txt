Abstract <p> The use of implantable hearing aids and cochlear implants as an aid to neurosensory deafness is becoming an established procedure . The transmission of a processed speech signal is accomplished either transcutaneously via radiofrequency or percutaneously by connector coupling . Whereas the former is sensitive to electromagnetic interference , the latter increases the risk of infection . To overcome these disadvantages , an infrared ( IR ) system for transmission through the tympanic membrane was devised and tested . The transmitter/receiver consisted of an IR light emitting diode ( LED ; 920nm ) and a photovoltaic cell . The LED was placed inside the auditory canal of four dogs and the photovoltaic cell in the tympanic cavity over the cochlear promontory . A sinusoidal signal modulation was applied to the LED . The emitted signal was detected undistorted after crossing the tympanic membrane , with an average absorbance of 20% . High-frequency cut-off was adequate for cochlear implant purposes and audio prosthetic devices in general . The authors conclude that the tympanic membrane may be used as a translucent sealed interface to transmit data in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small power loss , good frequency response , and immunity to interface . Introduction <p> Profound and severe hearing loss is a disease of great social importance , depriving a vast number of people of normal psychosocial integration with society . 1 <p> In many cases this decrease in hearing arises from pathologic conditions in the middle ear that can be compensated for with clinical or surgical intervention and sound amplifiers. 2-3 When it arises from abnormalities in the inner ear , sound amplification can compensate as long as an adequate number of cells of the auditory sensory organ remain functional . In most instances of this kind of deafness the auditory nerve fibers remain capable of conveying signals from cochlea to brain . <p> To overcome this sensory deficiency a device called a " cochlear implant " was developed , and it is being used extensively . Basically , this implant transforms acoustic energy waveforms into electrical signals that stimulate the cochlea through electrodes . From there , the information follows its physiologic path to the auditory nerve and brain. 4 The device consists of a microphone that feeds a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chosen band or bands , in the form of electric signals , must be conveyed to the cochlear electrode , and the path from the speech processor driver to the electrode must cross the skin and underlying tissues . At the present time , this is done either percutaneously 5 or transcutaneously. 6 The latter is accomplished by modulating the signal into a radiofrequency ( RF ) carrier wave that crosses the skin and tissues , reaching a subcutaneous implanted coil antenna that detects it by extracting the signal , using the RF energy to power implanted circuits . <p> This approach has the inconvenience of being susceptible to interference from strong electromagnetic ( EM ) fields . The percutaneous approach usually employs a plug anchored to the patient 's skull , crossing subcutis and skin , to reach the outside and accommodate the speech processor 's connector . This solution has the inconvenience of providing a path for infection . <p> Studies are being done with implantable hearing aids to increase their performance to treat sensorineural hearing loss . These early implantable hearing aids use the same transcutaneous or percutaneous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the possibility of conveying information and energy to the middle and inner ear by means of radiant energy transmission through the tympanic membrane . This approach performs this task while eliminating interference from RF sources and risk of infection . Materials and Methods <p> For this experiment we used a light emitting diode ( LED ) ( TIL 32 ; Texas Instruments , Dallas , TX ) , with peak emission in the 920nm wavelength , as the infrared light source . The detector is a specially made silicon photovoltaic cell ( Helio-dinamica S.A. , Sao Paulo , Brazil ) measuring 5 x 5 mm 2 with peak sensitivity between 850 and 1000 nm . We further coated the cell with three layers of medical grade silicone rubber . <p> Experiments were performed in four mongrel dogs with weight exceeding 15 kg . The animals were anesthetized with thionembutal , intubated , and submitted to assisted ventilation . A right retroauricular approach was carried out through an 8 cm incision through the skin and subcutaneous tissue following the retroauricular sulcus . Retroauricular muscle was displaced , and the temporal bone periosteum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transition of the external auditory canal . Once the canal and the cortical portion of the temporal bone was exposed , a mastoidectomy was performed with a drill . The middle ear cavity medial to the tympanic membrane was exposed through a posterior tympanotomy . <p> The photocell was placed in the middle ear very close to the tympanic membrane , and the LED was introduced through the external auditory canal , also very close to the tympanic membrane on the external ear side . The distance between the photocell and LED was roughly 2 mm ( Figure 1 ) . <p> The experiments were designed to determine the transmission characteristics , frequency response , and power capability of the system . <p> The experiments with the dogs was in compliance with NIH guidelines for the use of laboratory animals . Transmission Characteristics <p> To determine the system 's input/output characteristics and the tympanic membrane 's light absorption , we measured the photocell 's voltage output against infinite load impedance for various input currents to the LED . This was done before and after tympanotomy with LED and photocell in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ source , a standard amperemeter , and a digital voltmeter . Internal Resistance <p> The cell 's internal resistance was obtained by connecting a multiturn precision potentiometer to the cell 's output while maintaining a fixed input current to the LED . We used the accepted procedure of increasing the load from open circuit to a value that halves the output voltage . Frequency Response <p> The cell 's frequency response was obtained by biasing the LED with a DC current , adding to it a sinusoidal current provided by a standard oscillator , and varying its frequency beginning at 20 Hz and increasing it from there . We measure the AC output of the cell until the high-frequency cut-off was reached . This procedure was performed for several different levels of potential hearing loss . Results <p> Typical input/output characteristics are shown in Figure 2 . We have found some variability in these characteristics from one animal to another . Nevertheless , the shape of the curve and orders of magnitude were maintained . <p> The tympanic average absorbance , as described above , was approximately 20% . Internal resistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Figure 3 . <p> Figure 4 gives the maximum power transfer ( load equal to internal resistance ) as a function of input current . Figure 5 depicts the frequency response of the system for several loads . Discussion <p> This study represents a first effort to appraise the possibility of transmitting information by radiant energy through the tympanic membrane into the middle and inner ears . <p> The results show that such an approach is possible . Tympanic absorbance is of a magnitude that will not markedly hinder power transmission . Frequency response is clearly adequate to transmit , without critical distortion , analog or digitally-encoded signals found in actual cochlear implants . Impedance matching may be a requirement , depending upon the circumstances . Figure 6 shows actual input and output waveforms for a 2,000 Hz input frequency processed by pulse encoding . <p> Direct cochlear stimulation from the photovoltaic cell does not seem feasible with the components tested , known tissue impedances , and power requirements . A more powerful light source or more efficient photocells may provide the answer . However , the characteristics of the tested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of supplying power to the amplifier can be worked out through RF transmission , in which case interference would not be a serious inconvenience , since no information is added to the wave . In addition , an implantable lithium cell might provide a practical answer , because of the minimal power involved . Conclusion <p> The experimental evidence so far obtained points toward a feasible system to transmit information to the middle and inner ears by way of a sealed path through the tympanic membrane .
