<p> THE RESIDUE OF THE LOMA PRIETA QUAKE <p> Editor  --  The most important Loma Prieta earthquake residue is the chaos and traffic jams still with us because the collapsed Nimitz Freeway segments have still not been repaired . <p> The cause and cure of the collapsing freeway are not difficult to assess . Looking at the collapsed segments , it was obvious that they collapsed because the rebar segments holding the end of one span to the next were not long enough . <p> The repairs should ( and could ) have been completed and use restored within 60 days ( Bay Bridge repairs should have taken 30 days ) . It is obvious that the freeway should have been rebuilt in the same place , and crazy that a tiny number of NIMBYs could stall such an important transportation link to so many people for this long . After all , were n't they able to go right ahead with spending millions to foolishly widen I-80 Albany-Berkeley with no such delays ? <p> Why on earth do so many long- suffering commuters put up with it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and put on a bus for Los Angeles . <p> S. L. RENNACKER <p> Berkeley <p> . <p> ' DANGERS OF HOMEWORK ' <p> Editor  --  All of us here on the coast should be grateful for the service that a trustee of Garrett Redmond 's caliber has rendered the Cabrillo Unified School District , if his " memorial proposition " to abolish homework epitomizes the quality of his past contributions . <p> With exceptional percipience , Mr. Redmond goes to the very heart of the problem that thwarts the educational process : the inherent nastiness and danger of homework . As he clearly sees it , requiring students to complete school assignments at home is unfair to those who : 1 ) can not get help from friends and relatives , and 2 ) live in conditions that are not conducive to studying . Moreover , homework 1 ) eviscerates family life by depriving the student of time he/she could be interacting with the family ; 2 ) turns the youngster into a dullard ; and 3 ) , perhaps most importantly , forces the community to shell out for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things , e.g. , drag strip development , a project currently promoted by certain business types here as a panacea for youth in search of meaningful activity . <p> Redmond might consider the possibility that the pupil who does n't find time for homework now will certainly have to find time for standing in the unemployment line later . <p> ROBERT A. BARRETT <p> Half Moon Bay <p> . <p> STRIKING A CHORD <p> Editor  --  In reference to " Huffington Stirs Up a Fake Campaign Issue " ( Chronicle , September 28 ) , I love watching the liberal press squirm under the pressure of an effective expose of their favorite local pork-barrel politician . Ever since Mike Huffington began to tell the voters of California what was really going on in Washington on behalf of California he has surged in the polls . His success is not fake or fraudulent . He has struck a chord with the voters of this state and The Chronicle ca n't believe it . It is so clear that you are lashing out at nothing because you ca n't deny that Dianne Feinstein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ votes that affect California . <p> The Rosemary Barkett issue is not a " fake " campaign issue . It highlights the problems with a career politician such as Dianne Feinstein . She votes with the crowd , not on principles . She clearly votes against the will of the voters of California . Dianne does not represent me or the majority of my fellow voters . The real issues in this campaign are not " fake . " <p> LARRY GRAHAM <p> Chico <p> . <p> A COLLEAGUE 'S PRAISE <p> Editor  --  I want to tell Californians about something U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein and I worked on that will make a real difference in the lives of children in this country . <p> Senator Feinstein and I wrote a bill  --  now law  --  that sets a national standard to combat the crime wave that is moving from our streets to our classrooms . Our " Gun Free Schools Act " creates a national standard to warn students that if they bring a gun to school , they will face expulsion . <p> Our legislation gives school districts the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education if they wish . And it also gives school administrators the right to make exceptions on a case- by-case basis . So although we set a national standard , we also recognize the right of the local school boards to make sensible decisions in cases that warrant it . <p> The final days of political campaigns today all to often seem to sink into a blizzard of negatives . In the middle of all that , I just want to inject a positive word about Senator Feinstein 's excellent work on this issue . <p> This law  --  and Senator Feinstein 's efforts to enact it  --  will , in the future , save children 's lives . <p> Senator BYRON L. DORGAN <p> North Dakota <p> . <p> ADVICE FOR RABIN <p> Editor  --  If Rabin wants an end to violence , he should consider returning land and a means to economic survival to the people of Palestine and Gaza . If Rabin wants to add to the ranks of Hamas , he should maintain occupation , intimidation , importation of workers , violence , mass arrests , house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not allowed to live their lives , sacrificing their lives is an easy choice . <p> CATHERINE ANNE MARKEY <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> G STANDS FOR GULLIBLE <p> Editor  --  Proposition G author Randy Shaw 's October 20 letter about The Chronicle 's coverage of the issue disingenuously dismisses out-of-hand the serious analysis of a matter of great concern to San Francisco voters . Mr. Shaw would do well , however to reflect more closely on the real facts surrounding the Prop G. <p> The " grass-roots " campaign that Mr. Shaw describes simply does not exist . Voluminous newspaper reports and Registrar of Voters records have accurately detailed that the entire funding for Prop . G has come from only two sources ; more than $ 29,000 from Mr. Shaw 's taxpayer-supported housing clinic and the remainder from the Residential Builders Association ( RBA ) . <p> As for the " tailor-made " issue . I agree that The Chronicle explained only part of the story . Not only does Prop . G give enormous power to one elected official , but , because of the exact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lobbyist would almost certainly be considered for primary slots on the commission or for the $ 85,000-plus per year jobs in the new $ 1.1 million bureaucracy . <p> The " elite institutions " Mr. Shaw refers to as opposing the proposition include the Coalition for San Francisco Neighborhoods , San Francisco League of Neighborhoods , more than 40 neighborhood associations , S.F. Labor Council/ AFL-CIO , trade unions . S.F. Building &; Trades Council and the National Women 's Political Caucus . <p> Prop . G has been described by the responsible press throughout its life as " political fraud , " ' for the gullible , " " bankrolled by special interests , " " fatally flawed , " etc . <p> Mr. Shaw would do well to examine his own exhortation for " accountability " and to expand his awareness to see what citizens throughout San Francisco think about his scheme . <p> TIMOTHY GILLESPIE <p> Coalition to Achieve <p> Responsible Enforcement <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> RESTORE THE MAIN <p> Editor  --  If the citizens pass Prop . B to do seismic work on the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moneys with private donations to restore the glory of the Old Main . Just like the renaissance , public and private working together . Good return on the taxpayer 's investment . <p> RUSSELL R. MILLER <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> PROTECT THE MAIN <p> Editor  --  Whatever the reasons for the Asian Art Museum to want to move into the old Main Library building , these reasons do not make sense . Avery Brundage donated the Asian collection many years ago to the city of San Francisco . Golden Gate Park is the best place for the collection . The park offers easy access and parking , and affiliation with the other museums . <p> Why should the people of San Francisco be taxed for something not necessary . Some $ 31 million is a lot of money to pay for the ruin of a beautiful historic landmark Beaux Arts building . We should not allow anyone to ruin the California murals by Gottardo Piazzoni . <p> The Asian Art Museum should remain in Golden Gate Park so that many more people can enjoy it . <p> Vote No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> . <p> CARDS FOR MATT <p> Editor  --  My class is studying geography and we would like to know what your area looks like . When our unit is over , we hope to have a pictorial travel guide of your area . Please send your postcards to : <p> MATT <p> Mrs. Tanner 's class <p> 2 Woodruff Dr. <p> Littleton , CO 80127
