It was n't the first snow of the season . Panama , Vermont , lay far enough north to have already seen several snowdusted dawns . But this was n't dawn , and these flakes did n't dust . From early afternoon right on into evening , they fell heavy and fat and wet . Truckers stopping at the diner complained of the roads growing slick , but the warning carried little weight with locals . They knew that the sun would be back , even an Indian summer before winter set in . Snowfall now was simply frosting on the cake of another wildfire fall , thick flakes silencing the riot of colorful leaves , draping a plump white shawl on the town green 's oak benches , on marigolds that lingeringly lined front walks , on a bicycle propped against an open front gate . The scene was so peaceful that no one imagined the accident to come , least of all Bree Miller . Winter was her favorite season . There was something about snow that softened the world , made it make-believe for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prone to fancy  --  would have immediately denied it if accused  --  she had her private moments . She did n't bother with a jacket . The memory of summer 's heat was all too fresh . Besides , with locals wanting to eat before the weather worsened and with truckers bulking up , the diner had been hopping , so she was plenty warm without . She slipped out the door , closing it tight on the hum of conversation , the hiss and sizzle of the grill , the sultry twang of Shania Twain . In the sudden hush , she ran lightly down the steps , across the parking lot , then the street . On the far side , she flattened her spine to the crusty trunk of a large maple whose amber leaves hung heavy with snow , and looked back . The diner was a vision of stainless steel and neon , rich purples and greens bouncing off silver , new and more gallant through a steady fall of snow . Gone were little items on her fix-it list  --  the scrape Morgan Willis 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the front railing , bird droppings off the edge of the roof . What remained was sparkling clean , warm , and inviting , starting with the diner 's roadside logo , concentric rings of neon forming a large frying pan with the elegant eruption of FLASH AN ' THE PAN from its core . Behind that were golden lamps at each of ten broad windows running the diner 's length and , in booths behind those lamps , looking snug and content , the customers . The diner was n't Bree 's . She just worked there . But she liked looking at it . Same with Panama . Up the hill , at the spot where East Main leveled into an oval around the town green , snow capped the steel roofs of the row of tall Federals and beyond , white on white , the church steeple . Down the hill , at the spot where the road dipped past the old train depot , snow hid the stains that years of diesel abuse had left and put a hearty head on the large wood beer stein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes off the highway on the truck route running from Concord to Montreal . Being neither here nor there was one of its greatest strengths . There were no cookie-cutter subdivisions , no planned developments with architect-designed wraparound porches . Porches had been wrapping around houses in Panama since the days of the Revolution , not for the sake of style but for community . Those porches were as genuine as the people who used them . Add the lack of crime and the low cost of land , and the town 's survival was ensured . Bright minds sought haven here and found inspiration . The brewery was but one example . There was also a bread company , workshops producing hand-carved furniture and wooden toys , and a gourmet ice cream factory . Native Panamanians lent stability . Newcomers brought cash . Bree drew in a snow-chilled breath , held it deep in her lungs , let it slowly out . The occasional snowflake breached the leaves overhead to land in an airy puff on her arm , looking soft , feeling rich , in those few seconds before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree trunk to face the woods . Here , the snow picked up the diner 's lights in a mystical way . Drifting leaves whirled about , forest fairies at play , Bree fancied . From nowhere came childhood images of carousels , clowns , and Christmas , all more dream than memory . She listened hard , half expecting to hear elf sounds mixed in with those of nocturnal creatures . But , of course , there were none . Foolish Bree . High on snow . Time to go inside . Still she stood there , riveted by something that made her eyes mist and her throat ache . If it was wanting , she did n't know what for . She had a good life . She was content . Still she stood there . Behind her came a fragment of conversation when the diner door opened , and the subsequent growls , muted by billowing flakes , of one big rig , then a second . By the time the semis had rumbled out of the parking lot , cruised down the hill , and turned toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whisper of snow upon snow . The diner door opened again , this time to a louder " Bree ! I need you ! " Brushing tears from her eyes , she pushed off from the bark . Seconds later , she was running back across the road , turning her head against the densest of the flakes , suddenly so desperate to be back inside , where everything made sense , that she grew careless . She slipped , fought for balance with a flailing of arms , landed in the snow all the same . Scrambling up , she brushed at the seat of her black jeans and , with barely a pause to shake her hands free of snow , rushed inside , to be met by applause , several wolf whistles , and a " Way to go , Bree ! " The last was from a trucker , one of the regulars . Another round of applause broke out when she wrapped her icy hands around his bull neck and gave an affectionate squeeze on her way to the kitchen . Flash , the diner 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . A near-full gallon of milk hung from his fingers . " It 's bad again , " he said , releasing the door once she was inside . " What 're we gon na do ? Look of the roads , no delivery 's coming anytime soon . " " We have extra , " Bree assured him , opening the refrigerator to verify it . Flash ducked his head and took a look . " That 'll be enough ? " " Plenty . " " Seventeen 's up , Bree , " the grillman called . The diner sat fifty-two , in ten booths and twelve counter stools . At its busiest times , there were lines out the door , but bad weather slowed things down . Barely thirty-five remained now . LeeAnn Conti was serving half . The rest were Bree 's . Balancing four plates holding a total of twelve eggs , twelve rashers of bacon , six sausages , six slabs each of maple nut and raisin toast , and enough hash browns to crowd everything in , she delivered supper to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door . She had known the four all her life . They , too , had gone to the local schools and stayed to work in the area , Sam and Dave at the lumber mill three towns over , Andy at his family 's tackle store , Jack at the farm his father had left his brother and him . They were large men with insatiable appetites for early-evening breakfast . The Littles , two booths down , were another story . Ben and Liz had fled a New York ad agency to run their own by way of computer , fax , and phone from Vermont . Along with seven-year-old Benji , five-year-old Samantha , and two-year-old Joey , they hit the diner several times a week to take advantage of Flash 's huge portions , easily splitting three orders of turkey , mashed potatoes , and peas , or biscuit-topped shepherd 's pie , or American chop suey . They were currently sharing a serving of warm apple crisp and a large chocolate chip cookie . At Bree 's appearance , the two-year-old put down his hunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and opened his arms . She scooped him up . " Was everything good ? " He gave her a chocolaty grin that melted her heart . " Anything else here ? " she asked his parents . " Just the check , " said Ben . " That snow keeps coming . Driving wo n't be great . " When Joey squirmed , Bree kissed the mop of his hair and returned him to the bench . At the side counter , she tallied the check , then put it on their table and set to cleaning the adjacent booth , where the drivers of the newly departed big rigs had been . She cleared the dirty dishes , pocketed her tip , wiped down the black Formica , straightened shakers , condiment bottles , and the small black vase that held a spray of goldenrod . She set out new place mats , oval replicas of the frying pan from the logo , with the regular menu printed in its center . Specials  --  " The Daily Flash "  --  were hand written on each of two elliptical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved several booths down to Panama 's power elite  --  postmaster Earl Yarum , police chief Eliot Bonner , town meeting moderator Emma McGreevy . Before them were dishes that had earlier held a beef stew , a pork chop special , and a grilled chicken salad . All three plates , plus a basket of sourdough rolls , were empty , which was good news . When sated , Earl , Eliot , and Emma were innocuous . Bree grinned . " Ready for dessert ? " " Whaddya got ? " Earl asked . " Whaddya want ? " " Pie . " " O-kay . We have apple , peach , and blueberry . We have pumpkin . We have strawberry rhubarb , banana cream , maple cream , maple pecan , pumpkin pecan , lemon meringue  --  " " Anything chocolate ? " Earl asked . " Chocolate pecan , chocolate mousse , chocolate rum cream  --  " " How about a brownie ? " She might have guessed they were headed there . Earl was predictable . " One brownie , " she said , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Please . " Emma never had anything but tea . Eliot played his usual game , letting Bree list as many ice cream flavors as she could  --  Flash owned part of Panama Rich and stocked every one of its twenty-three flavors  --  before ordering a dish of plain old strawberry . Working around LeeAnn , the grillman , the cook , the dishwasher , and Flash , Bree warmed the brownie and added whipped cream , hot fudge , and nuts , the way Earl liked it , and scooped up Eliot 's ice cream . She served a chicken stir-fry to Panama 's only lawyer , Martin Sprague , in the six spot at the counter , and pork chops and chili to Ned and Frank Wright , local plumbers , two stools over . With carafes in either hand , she topped off coffees down the row of booths , then worked her way along the counter . At the far end sat Dotty Hale and her daughter , Jane . Both were tall and lean , but while Dotty 's face was tight , Jane 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age . Not that Bree was impartial . Jane was one of her closest friends . LeeAnn had her elbows on the counter before them . In contrast to the Hales , she was small and spirited , with short , spiked blond hair and eyes that filled her face . Those eyes were wider than ever . " Abby Nolan spent the night where ? But she just divorced John . " " Final last week , " Dotty confirmed , with the nod of a bony chin . " Court papers came in the mail . Earl saw them . " " So why 's she sleeping with him ? " " She is n't , " Jane said . Dotty turned on her . " This is n't coming from me . Eliot was the one who saw her car in John 's drive . " She returned to LeeAnn . " Why ? Because she 's pregnant . " LeeAnn looked beside herself with curiosity . " With John 's child ? How ? " Bree smiled dryly as she joined them . " The normal way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John 's . It 's Davey Hillard 's . " Dotty looked wounded . " Who told you that ? " " Abby , " Bree said . She , Abby , and Jane had been friends since grade school . " Then why 'd she spend the night with John ? " LeeAnn asked . " She did n't , " Jane said . " Were you there ? " Dotty asked archly . " Abby just went to talk , " Bree said to divert Dotty 's attention from Jane . " She and John are still friends . She wanted to break the news to him herself . " " That 's not what Emma says , " Dotty argued . Emma was her sister and her major source of gossip . " Know what else she says ? Julia Dean got a postcard . " " Mother , " Jane pleaded . " Well , it 's fact , " Dotty argued . " Earl saw the postcard and told Eliot , since he 's the one has to keep peace here and family being upset can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's here . The postcard was from her daughter in Des Moines , who said that it was a shame that Julia was isolating herself , and that she understood how upset she had been by Daddy 's death , that they all were , but three years of mourning should be enough , so when was she coming home ? " " All that on a postcard ? " Bree asked . She did n't know much more about Julia than that she had opened a small flower store three years before and twice weekly arranged sprigs in the diner 's vases . She came by for an occasional meal but kept to herself . She struck Bree as shy but sweet , certainly not the type to deserve being the butt of gossip . " Julia 's family does n't know about Earl , " Jane muttered . " Really . " Bree glanced toward the window when a bright light swelled there , another eighteen-wheeler pulling into the parking lot . " And then , " Dotty said , with a glance of her own at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw another UFO . Eliot says the lights were from a truck , but she insists there 's a mark on the back of her car where that mother ship tailed her . " LeeAnn leaned closer . " Did she see the baby ships again , the squiggly little pods ? " " I did n't ask . " Dotty shuddered . " That woman 's odd . " Bree had always found Verity more amusing than odd and would have said as much now if Flash had n't called . " Twenty-two 's up , LeeAnn . " Bree stayed LeeAnn with a touch . " I 'll get it . " She topped off Dotty 's coffee and returned the carafes to their heaters . Scooping up the chicken piccata with angel hair that was ready and waiting , she headed down the counter toward the booths . Twenty-two was the last in the row , tucked in the comer by the jukebox . A lone man sat there , just as he had from time to time in the last seven months . He never said much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like now , he was reading a book . His name was Tom Gates . He had bought the Hubbard place , a shingle-sided bungalow on West Elm that had n't seen a stitch of improvement in all the years that the Hubbards ' health had been in decline . Since Tom Gates had taken possession , missing shingles had been replaced , shutters had been straightened , the porch had been painted , the lawn cut . What had happened inside was more murky . Skipper Boone had rewired the place , and the Wrights had installed a new furnace , but beyond that , no one knew . And Bree had asked . She had always loved the Hubbard place . Though smaller than her Victorian , it had ten times the charm . She might have bought it herself if she 'd had the nerve , but she had inherited her own house from her father , who had inherited it from his . Millers had lived on South Forest for too many years to count and too many to move . So she contented herself with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bungalow on West Elm . None of those bits came from Tom Gates . He was n't sociable . Good-looking . Very good-looking . Too good-looking to be alone . But not sociable . " Here you go , " Bree said . When he moved his book aside , she slid the plate in . She wiped her palms on the back of her jeans and pushed her hands in the pockets there . " Reading anything good ? " His eyes shifted from his dinner back to the book . " It 's okay . " She tipped her head to see the title , but the whole front looked to be typed . " Weird cover . " " It has n't been published yet . " " Really ? How 'd you get it ? " " I know someone . " " The author ? " When he shook his head , the diner 's light shimmered in hair that was shiny , light brown , and a mite too long . " Are you a reviewer ? " she asked . He shifted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then , " she decided . Not that he looked scholarly . He was too tanned , too tall , too broad in the shoulders . Coming and going , he strode . Flash bet that he was a politician who had lost a dirty election and fled . Dotty bet he was a burned-out businessman , because Earl told of mail from New York . LeeAnn bet he was an adventurer recouping after a tiring trek . Bree could see him as an adventurer . He had that rugged look . His buying a house in town did n't mean much . Even adventurers needed to rest sometimes , but they did n't stay put for long . Panama bored men who loved risk . This one would be gone before long . It was a shame , because Tom Gates had great hands . He had long , lean , blunt-tipped fingers and moved them in a way that suggested they could do most anything they tried . Bree had never once seen dirt under his nails , which set him apart from most of the men who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calluses those men did , his hands looked well used . He had cut himself several months back and had needed stitches . The scar was nearly two inches long and starting to fade . " I just finished the new Dean Koontz , " she said . " Have you read it yet ? " He was studying his fork . " No . " " It 's pretty good . Worth a shot . Can I get you anything else ? Another beer ? " She hitched her chin toward the longneck on the far side of his plate . " You know that 's local , do n't you ? Sleepy Creek Pale . It 's brewed down the street . " His eyes met hers . They were wonderfully gray . " Yes , " he said . " I do know . " She might have been lured by those eyes to say something else , had not the front door opened just then to a flurry of flakes and the stamping boots of four truckers . Shaking snow from heads and jackets , they called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seventeen , and slid into sixteen , which meant they were Bree 's . " Nothing else ? " she asked Tom Gates again . When he shook his head , she smiled . " Enjoy your meal . " Still smiling , she walked on down the line . " Hey , guys , how 're you doin ' ? " " Cold . " " Tired . " " Hungry . " " A regular round for starters ? " she asked . When the nods came fast , she went to the icebox on the wall behind the counter , pulled open the shiny steel door , and extracted two Sleepy Creek Pales , one Sleepy Creek Amber , and a Heineken . Back at the booth , she fished a bottle opener from the short black apron skimming her hips and did the honors . " Ahhhhh , " said John Hagan after a healthy swallow . " Good stuff on a night like this . " Bree glanced out the window . " How many inches would you say ? " " Four , " John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " argued Kip Tucker . " Headed to twenty , " warned Gene Mackey for the benefit of a passing , predictably gullible LeeAnn . " Twenty ? " Bree nudged Gene 's shoulder . " He 's putting you on , Lee . Come on , guys . Behave . " " What fun is that ? " Gene asked , hooking her waist and pulling her close . She unhooked his arm . " All the fun you 're getting , " she said , with a haughty look . " I 'll be back to take your order once I 'm done scraping down plates . " " I 'll have my usual , " T. J. Kearns said fast , before she could leave . " Me , too , " said Gene . John pointed at himself and nodded , indicating beef pot pie topped with mashed potatoes and gravy , served with hunks of bread for dunking and whatever vegetables Flash had that day , buttered . Kip was eyeing the specials board . " What 's he got up there that I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said in a cultured way , " sauted in butter and served on a bed of basmati rice , with sun-dried tomatoes , Portobello mushrooms , and broccoli . " Kip sighed his pleasure . " One up , right here . Thanks , doll . " Panama lay in hill country . Come the first of November , sand barrels sat on most every corner , trucks carried chains , and folks without four-wheel drive put on snow tires . But this was n't the first of November . It was the ninth of October , and the snow was coming heavy and fast . By eight , only a handful of stragglers remained . Armed with a laptop computer and her own serving of trout , Bree slid in across from Flash . He was reading the newspaper , alternately sipping coffee and pulling at one of two sticky buns on his plate , no doubt his dinner . She never failed to be amazed that a man who was endlessly artful when it came to creating meals for others had such abominable eating habits himself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I hate bones . " " There are n't any bones . Not in your trout . " " That 's what we tell the customers , " he said , without looking up , " but I never know for sure if I get them all out , and the fear of it would ruin my meal . Besides "  --  he looked up then  --  " there are n't usually any sticky buns left after five . Why are there today ? " Bree opened the laptop . " Because Angus , Oliver , and Jack did n't make it in "  --  and wisely so , since the three were in their eighties and better at home in a storm . " Flash ? " asked LeeAnn . She shot a look at the last man at the counter . " Gav says he 'll drive me home , since I do n't have boots or anything , but he ca n't hang around till we close . " Her brows rose . Flash shot a look at Bree . " Ask her . She 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Bree shooed her off . " No one else is coming in . Not tonight . Go . " LeeAnn went . " She skips out early too often , " Flash said . " You have a soft heart . " " Yours is softer than mine , which is why you did n't say no first . Besides , she has kids at home . I do n't . " " Why not ? " he asked . Bree pulled up the supply list . " I think we 've been through this before . " " Tell me again . I especially like the part about needing a man to have kids , like you could n't have any guy who walked in here . Know what turns them on ? Your disinterest . " " It is n't disinterest . It 's caution . " Caution sounded kinder . Disinterest was probably more to the point . The men who passed through the diner were just fine for conversation and laughs . They gave appreciative looks to her hair , which was thick , dark , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her body , which was of average height and better toned than most . What they liked most , though , was the fact that she served them without argument and , more , that she knew what they wanted before they said it . Her father had liked that , too . She had been his cook , his maid , his tailor , his barber , his social secretary ... the list went on and on . In the days following his death , she 'd had her very first taste of me time . Now , three years later , it was still both novelty and prized possession . " Caution . Ahh . Well , that is you , Bree . Cautious to a fault . Have you hired someone to get you a decent heating system , or are you still getting estimates ? " " I 'm still getting estimates . " He glanced at the snow . " Time just ran out . " " Give it a day . Sun 'll be back . " " You 're only postponing the inevitable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why wait ? You have money . " " I have money for a new car . That 's first on my list . Heating is second . " " That 's crazy . " " Why ? I have a woodstove in the kitchen and quilts in every room . I can stay warm whether the furnace works or not . But I ca n't go anywhere without a car . " She tapped the laptop 's screen . " We have to talk about getting a new milk supplier . " " No . " She softened her tone . " Stafford 's local . We both want to support him , but his deliveries are late more often than not , and lately a full quarter of what he brings is bad . Think back two hours . You were in a panic . " " I was tired , is all . Stafford 's working the kinks out . " " He 's been working the kinks out for two years , but they are n't going away  --  " " Give him a little longer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resumed reading . Bree did n't know whether to laugh or cry . Oh , yes , Flash was softhearted , a sucker if the truth were told , though that was a good half of the diner 's charm . He was an artist . Try as he might to look like a trucker in the black jeans , purple T-shirt , and bill cap that were the diner 's uniform , he could n't pull it off . Even without the long mane spilling from the hole in the back of his cap , he had too gentle a look , and that was even before he waved off the difference when one of the town 's poorest came up short on cash at the end of a meal . Not that Bree was complaining . Had her boss been anyone else , she would still be waitressing , period . But Flash was n't hung up on formalities . She was good with numbers , so he had her balance the books . She was good with deadlines , so he had her pay the bills . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people who serviced the drink machines , the people who trucked in fresh eggs , vegetables , and fish . Hungry , she dug into her trout and broccoli . Focusing on the computer screen , she plugged in the week 's expected deliveries , noted shortages that had arisen , set up orders to be placed as soon as she hooked the computer to the modem in the back office . Flash was a softie there , too . That modem had been installed within twenty-four hours of her saying it might be nice . The sound of spinning wheels drew her eye to the window , where a truck was heading out of the lot . After a minute , the tires gained traction , the sound evened out , and taillights disappeared in the thickening snow . By eight-fifty , the last of the diners had left , fifty-two places had been wiped down and set for breakfast , dishes had been washed , food put away , the grill scraped . Minutes after Flash officially called it a night , the staff was gone . Bree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll drive you home . " She shook her head . " Driving is slow . It 'll be faster if I walk . " Tugging up the leg of her jeans , she showed him her boots . " Besides , you live downhill , I live uphill . No need backtracking in weather like this . " But Flash was insistent . Taking her arm , he guided her out the door . The world had changed dramatically since Bree 's earlier foray into the storm . With the exception of bare pavement where others of the staff had parked and just left , everything was pure white , and colder , far colder than before . " It 's too early for this , " Flash grumbled as they approached his Explorer . While he dug behind his seat for a scraper , Bree started on the windows with the sleeve of her jacket . When he took over with the brush , she climbed inside . Leaning over the gearshift , she started the engine and , once the windshield was clear , turned on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , another several inches of snow had fallen . Between those inches and what had been left around cars that were parked , the lot was ragged . Flash gunned his engine to back the Explorer over the pile of snow at its own rear , then shifted into drive . The Explorer jolted its way to the street . Bree stared hard out the windshield . As far as she could tell , the only thing marking the road was the slightly lower level of snow there . The headlights of the Explorer swung a bright arc onto East Main . Flash accelerated . His tires spun , found purchase , started slowly up the hill . They had n't gone far when the spinning resumed . The Explorer slid sideways . He braked , downshifted , and tried again . " Bad tires ? " she asked . " Bad roads , " he muttered . " Not if you 're going downhill . Let me walk . Please ? " He resisted through several more tries , shifting from drive to reverse and back in an attempt to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for long . The Explorer had barely reached the first of five houses that climbed the hill to the town green when , sliding sideways and back this time , he gave in . Bree pulled up her hood and slid out . " Thanks for trying . See you tomorrow . " Shutting the door , she burrowed into her jacket and started up the hill . At first , with the Explorer coasting backward , its headlights lit her way . When Flash turned at the diner 's driveway and came out headfirst , the lights disappeared . Moments later , even the sound of his engine was gone . In the silence , Bree trekked upward . The snow on the road was n't deep , rising only to the top of her boots , but she had the same problem the Explorer had . With the drop in temperature , the thin layer of packed snow left by the plow had frozen under the new-fallen stuff . She kept slipping on the steepening incline . Tightening her hood , she tucked her hands in her pockets and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flew out for balance , hands bare and cold . She wished she had gloves , wished it even more in the next instant , when she lost her footing and landed wrist deep in the snow . Straightening , she shook herself off and went on . One more slip , though , and she trudged to the side of the road . The snow was deeper there , well past her calves , which made the walking harder but safer . Head bowed against the steady fall of snow , she leaned into the climb . She had walked the same route for years , barely had to lift her eyes to know where she was . One foot rose high after the other to clear the drifts . By the time she passed the last of the houses , her thighs were feeling the strain . She felt instant relief when the road leveled off at the top . Turning left , she started around the town green under the gaslights ' amber glow . There were no cars about , just snow-shrouded shapes in driveways . Wood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Snow slid , with a rush and a thud , down tall steel panels from roof to ground . The curve of the road took her past the Federal that housed the bank , with smaller offices above for the town 's lawyer , realtor , and chiropractor . The one beside it housed the Chalifoux family , the one beside that the Nolans , the one beside that the library . Farther on , in a more modest house , lived the minister and his family . At the end of the oval , spire high , large green shutters and doors finely edged in snow , was the church . The wood fence circling the churchyard had disappeared under the snow , as had the split-rail one around the town green . But the green was n't to be missed . A true common area , it had recently been host to sunbathers , picnickers , and stargazers . Now the limbs of maples , birches , and firs hung low to the ground under the weight of the snow , transforming stately trees into weepers . The sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the green , a pickup coasted down from Pine Street and cruised slowly around the oval . When it reached Bree , it stopped . Curtis Lamb rolled down his window . " Just comin ' from work ? " Bree raised an arm to shield her eyes from the snow . " Yeah . " " Want a lift ? " But Curtis lived downhill , not far from Flash . She smiled , shook her head , gestured toward Birch Hill , just beyond the church . " I 'm almost there . You go on . " Curtis rolled up his window . The pickup went slowly forward , turned right at the bank , and started down East Main . Bree resumed the hike . She was making good time now , was actually enjoying the snow . It was cleansing , coming so soon after summer 's sweat . Another engine broke the stillness , with a growing sputter . Bree guessed the vehicle was climbing Birch Hill . Its headlights had just appeared when a second pickup swooped down Pine , far off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast . She watched it skid onto the oval , regain traction , and barrel toward her end . Eager to be out of its way , she quickened her step . At the corner , she turned onto Birch Hill . The car climbing it  --  a bare-bones Jeep  --  was twenty feet off but approaching steadily , so she hopped from the street into the deeper snow at the side . The pickup kept coming . Alarmed by its speed , fascinated in a horrified way , Bree stopped walking . The pickup looked to be dull blue and old . She figured that whoever was driving was either drunk , inexperienced , or just plain dumb . " Slow down , " she warned . At the rate it was going , it would surely skid when it turned . And it was going to have to turn , either right onto Birch Hill or left around the oval . If it went straight , it would hit her head-on . Suddenly frightened , she moved . Running as quickly as she could through the deep snow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ill-timed move . Seconds after she passed the Jeep , she heard the crunch of metal on metal . Then the Jeep was skidding back , sliding faster than she could run and in the god-awful same direction . Its impact with her was quieter . She felt a searing pain and a moment 's weightlessness , then nothing at all .
