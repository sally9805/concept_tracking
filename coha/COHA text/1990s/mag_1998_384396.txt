Section : clinic What 's it like when your heart gives out ? One man 's experience 5:10 P.M. <p> IT BEGAN WHILE I WAS sitting in the sauna at the gym , something I try to do two or three times a week . But this time the air seemed hotter than usual My SI-year-old body was sweating a lot , and I felt sick to my stomach  --  the way you do when you are out of shape and exercise too much . This was odd , because I 'd only been in the sauna for 10 minutes and I usually stay twice that long . 5:20 P.M. <p> I got out of the sauna and into the shower . I felt queasy enough that I only managed to wash my hair . I was concerned that I might faint , so I dried off , sat down , and tried to cool off . 5:30 P.M. <p> I started to drive to my home in Dexter , Michigan , and kept feeling worse . A sense of malaise was spreading across my chest and upper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was as if a balloon were expanding inside my head . I considered turning around and going to the hospital , but I could n't think of the best way to get there . When I arrived at the entrance to the highway , I continued heading home . At that point I did n't know what was happening , but I could think of a reasonable explanation for each symptom . Maybe I felt sick in the sauna because I was out of shape ; maybe I was coming down with the flu ; maybe I had a headache because it had been a hectic day at work . In reality , a piece of plaque had broken off inside one of my arteries . A clot was forming around it , and as it grew , my symptoms became more pronounced . 6:00 P.M. <p> I arrived at home and told my family-they were eating dinner  --  that I did n't feel well . I took two aspirin and walked upstairs . We were supposed to go to a school program at 6:30 , and I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes . I did n't ; I kept feeling worse . For some reason I did n't want to open my eyes , even though the light was subdued and my eyes were n't stinging , as they sometimes do when you have the flu . 6:15 P.M. <p> I could n't shake the malaise , and I started to feel slightly clammy . I called Thane , our 10-year-old , and asked him to get my wife , Noreen . I was upset to think that my family might have to leave for school without me . When Thane returned with Noreen , I asked him to hold my hand . Louisa , our 4-year-old , also came near the bed , and I asked her to hold my other hand . These little hands were my contact with life , and I thought that if I were to die now , I would die happy . I love my children very much , and I 'm proud of each of them . Noreen asked if she should call 911 . I hesitated . Maybe I did n't cool down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was why I was sweaty . Besides , calling 911 causes a lot of people a lot of trouble , and it meant I could n't handle things by myself . As I thought about this , I sensed a slight shortness of breath . When Noreen asked me again if she should call 911 , I nodded yes . 6:25 P.M. <p> I heard the fire-department siren and immediately felt relief . One of the firemen was a neighbor , and it was good to see him . I told the firemen my symptoms , and they administered oxygen . Pretty soon the paramedics arrived in the ambulance , bringing the total number of people around my bed to six . When the chief paramedic spoke to me , he came very close  --  about 18 inches face-to-face . I did n't know if he was trained to do this or if he was having difficulty hearing me . I normally speak softly , and my voice was even quieter now because I was wearing an oxygen mask . Either way , he had my full attention and apparently heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nitroglycerin to expand my arteries , and they hooked me to a heart monitor . They put an IV in my left arm and started giving me morphine . This was not only to help with the pain but also to keep me calm . After all , as far as any of us knew , I might be dying . 6:50 P.M. <p> Since I was upstairs and the ambulance was 17 stairs below , the paramedics put me on a kitchen chair and muscled me downstairs . I arrived on our front lawn like the pharaoh in Exodus : the man with the hardened heart , conveyed on a makeshift throne , with the ambulance lights flashing and the neighborhood arrayed a discreet and respectful distance away . Thane stood off to one side , comforted by a neighbor . As I was being lifted onto the stretcher , Thane walked toward me with a worried look . I winked and told him I thought I 'd be all right . Later , I found out he 'd asked the ambulance driver if I would be okay . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The implication , of course , was that I might not . 7:00 P.M. <p> Riding into the city of Ann Arbor in the ambulance was like riding in an old flatbed truck : bumpy and slow . For some reason the driver did n't turn on the siren , and it seemed like every traffic light stopped us . The paramedics continued giving me oxygen , nitroglycerin and morphine , none of which made me feel better but all of which kept me from feeling worse . Near the end of the trip , when I realized it was taking a long time to reach the hospital , I wondered why the driver did n't put on his flashing lights . Maybe he thought it would make me more apprehensive . 7:30 P.M. <p> We finally arrived at the University of Michigan Hospital . I was amazed by how calm everyone was . The paramedics immediately handed me over to a technician and a nurse , who gave me more oxygen , nitroglycerin and morphine . They also hooked me to a heart monitor and ran IVs into both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me questions . Everyone seemed to ask the same questions . I found out later that the staff is trained to do this , since patients sometimes do n't give complete answers . If enough people ask , they figure , eventually you 'll give them what they need . ( They were right . The next day I remembered to tell them about an uncle who died 30 years ago from a heart attack , when he was in his early 50s . ) As the minutes passed , I continued to be struck by how calm-indeed , slow  --  everyone appeared . Maybe time was rushing ahead for me . I was also struck by how genuinely kind and caring everyone was . Even when I tried to hold back tears of joy , some leaked through . 8:00 P.M. <p> The head E.R. doc told me a cardiologist was on his way downstairs . When the cardiologist arrived , he said I was having a heart attack right then . He told me he wanted to give me some medication , but he warned me that there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you might have about an over-the-counter drug available at the local pharmacy . I 'm a good patient , so I asked what that risk was . He said there was some chance of bleeding . When I asked what that meant , he said there should n't be any problem unless there was bleeding in my brain . I immediately thought : Bleeding in my brain probably means I 'm going to die . <p> I shrugged my shoulders and said okay to having the medication . They gave me three large doses of TPA , a drug designed to dissolve blood clots. 9:40 P.M. <p> I was asked , " On a scale of 1 to 10 , with 10 being the worst pain you 've ever had , how much does it hurt ? " They seemed to expect it to hurt a lot , but compared with other pain I 've had it did n't . I finally settled on " 3 . " Eventually I figured out they did n't really care how much it hurt ; they cared how much less it hurt . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was . The pain subsided and the EKGs settled down . It was almost over . I was wheeled to the intensive care unit and rewired . <p> YOU DO N'T SLEEP MUCH in an ICU . With IVs in both arms and four wires dangling from your chest , all you can do is lie on your back . Every so often a nurse comes in to take your temperature and blood pressure . Every 8 hours someone draws blood to see how much of your heart actually died . Although there is no bathroom , the service is good . Sandwiches and sherbet are available around the clock , and nurses come very quickly when you press the call button . I remained in the ICU for two days . Eventually the pain went away , except for the nitroglycerin-induced headache . When they quit giving me nitroglycerin , even that subsided . All the tests pointed to the same thing : I 'd had a mild attack on the right side of my heart , with very little heart damage . I survived  --  the first 24 hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what had gone wrong , and what I could do to avoid another ambulance ride . How to React to an Attack What to do if you think you 're having a heart attack <p> THE PAIN COMES from nowwhere , hits you smack in the chest , and maybe even spreads to your neck , shoulders or arms . Or maybe you ca n't catch your breath , your skin feels clammy , and you 're onthe verge of either throwing up or passing out . Do n't ignore these signs , tough guy . You could he having a heart attack <p> What should you do about it ? Seek medical attention now . The sooner doctors bust up the clot that 's stifling the flow of blood through your oxygen-starved heart , the less likely it is you 'll sustain any permanent damage . Call for an ambulance right away or , if it 's faster , have someone take you to a hospital , in the meantime , here are five ways you can help yourself : <p> Chew an aspirin .

" A plain , full-strength aspirin tablet is a very potent anticlotting agent , " says Richard O'Brien , M.D. , a spokesman for the American College of Emergency Physicians . One caution : Stay away from aspirin if you 're allergic to it , or if you have a history of ulcers . <p> Cough if you feel faint . Severe lightheadedness is a sign your brain is n't getting enough blood and oxygen . Should blood flow slack off too much , you 'll lose consciousness and your brain will start dying within minutes . If you think you 're about to pass out , start coughing as hard as you can  --  one cough every 1 to 3 seconds  --  and do n't stop until help arrives . This delivers a CPR-like oush to the chest , says Dr. O'Brien . <p> Do n't hide your Viagra . The coupling of the erection-booster sildenafil with nitroglycerin or any other nitrate-containing heart drug can produce a deadly drop in blood pressure . Come clean with the paramedics and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other drug . Better yet , keep a list of your medications in your wallet . <p> Get a cardiologist on your case . Emergency physicians can pull you through any immediate crisis , but once they finish their job , insist that a cardiologist oversee your care the rest of the way . Studies suggest that patients under their care fare best . <p> Do your homework now . Do n't wait until you have a heart attack to find out if your hospital and your insurance provider are up to the challenge . Major teaching hospitals or those with a chest-pain unit in the emergency department are often better prepared for heart-attack patients . Find out if the ambulance companies that serve your area automatically take chest-pain calls to these facilities . Ask your insurance company these questions : Can you pick your hospital ? In an emergency , do you need permission from your provider to see a cardiologist ? The American College of Emergency Physicians has a checklist that can help you evaluate your insurance plan .
