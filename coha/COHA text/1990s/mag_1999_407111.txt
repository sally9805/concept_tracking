If you 've ever tried growing rhododendrons in the South , you know the procedure consists of five easy steps . Headnote Buy your rhododendron . Plant your rhododendron . Cry over your dead rhododendron . Throw away your rhododendron . Surrender . Plant a holly instead . Photograph // Why do rhododendrons give us fits ? Because they 're suited to the more temperate regions of the world , where folks seldom fry catfish on their foreheads in July . Rhodies prefer cool summer nights , regular rainfall , and practically perfect drainage . That does n't sound like my garden-and probably not yours either . But do n't give up . You can still enjoy beautiful rhododendrons by heeding the following instructions . Choose the right one . Nurseries sell hundreds of different selections , but relatively few grow well in the South . Stick to the tried-and-true ones ( see the chart on page 56 ) . These combine cold hardiness , heat tolerance , and disease resistance . Buy Southern . Many rhododendrons sold at garden centers come from the Pacific Northwest . Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough oxygen to reach the roots in the South 's more stressful climate , the plants sometimes get diseases and die . One way to prevent disease is to plant rhododendrons correctly ( see page 56 ) . But you should also favor plants grown in the South and East over those grown in the West . If you 're unsure where rhododendrons in your garden center came from , check the tag or ask the nurseryman . As an alternative , order plants . Good mail-order sources include : Transplant Nursery , Lavonia , GA ( 706 ) 3568947 ; Roslyn Nursery , Dix Hills , NY ( 516 ) 643-9347 ; and Pushepetappa Gardens , Franklinton , LA ( 504 ) 839-4930 . Find the right spot . Although some rhodies tolerate full sun , most do best in light , dappled shade . But do n't plant them beneath maples , beeches , willows , or magnolias because these shallow-rooted trees steal moisture and nutrients . And do n't plant them beneath a black walnut , as the roots of this tree release a chemical that is toxic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oaks , pines , tulip poplars , and hickories . Avoid western exposures . Planting on the western side subjects plants to hot , drying summer sun and cold , drying winter wind . Plant on the north side of your garden instead . Keep in mind that , with the exception of the Bonneville Salt Flats , the worst spot for a rhododendron may be up against your house . The soil there often reeks of clay and lime and alternates between desert and swamp . Also , snow and ice falling from your roof will snap the shrub 's brittle branches . Better locations include shrub borders and the edge of a woodland . Plant rhododendrons correctly . They need a loose , acid ( pH 4.5 to 5.5 ) , fertile soil containing lots of organic matter . Forget about planting in heavy , red clay . Jeff Beasley , owner of Transplant Nursery in Lavonia , Georgia , suggests the following regimen for planting a rhododendron . Dig a hole at least 10 inches deep and twice as wide as the root ball . Mix equal amounts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bark does not contain lime ) . Fill the hole with this mixture ; do not tamp it when finished . Place the rhododendron atop the filled hole . Then mix one part excavated soil to three parts bark , and mound soil around the sides of the root ball , leaving the top of the ball exposed . Cover the ball with 1 or 2 inches of pine straw . Go easy on the fertilizer . If the leaves become chlorotic ( yellow between the veins ) , use a product such as Miracid that supplies chelated iron . Otherwise , just sprinkle a half cup of cottonseed meal or 1 tablespoon azalea-camellia food around the dripline of the plant in spring . " Always water thoroughly , " cautions Willis Harden a rhododendron expert in Commerce , Georgia . " Rhododendrons do n't respond well to light , daily watering . They need a deep soaking of I to 2 inches per week . Water in the morning , never at night . The leaves need to dry prior to evening or they 'll get fungal diseases . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grow a rhododendron . Of course , that leaves you with a new problem .
