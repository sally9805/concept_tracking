<p> Miami Beach police are looking for a suspected serial killer in connection with the slaying of Gianni Versace , the famed Italian fashion designer shot to death yesterday in front of his ornate , Mediterranean-style mansion . <p> The FBI and local police said the prime suspect is Andrew Phillip Cunanan , 27 , of San Diego , who has been on the FBI 's Ten Most Wanted list since he was linked to four killings in late April and early May in Minnesota , Illinois and New Jersey . <p> The 50-year-old Versace was killed as he returned yesterday morning from a cafe to his home  --  a sprawling white stucco mansion facing the Atlantic Ocean in the city 's South Beach area , the fashion center of Miami . The gunman fired two bullets into the back of the designer 's head and fled . <p> Police described the killing as " targeted " and said several items of evidence link Cunanan to the killing , including a red pickup truck found in a parking garage near the crime scene . The truck belonged to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Miami Beach Police Chief Richard Barreto described Cunanan as a well-educated , articulate man " known to be a male prostitute who serviced affluent clients . " But authorities said they did not know whether Cunanan and Versace , who was gay , knew each other . <p> " He ( Cunanan ) should be considered armed and extremely dangerous , " said Barreto . <p> In recent weeks , 2,000 posters of Cunanan  --  who spent a fair amount of time in San Francisco in recent years  --  had been distributed throughout Florida . Authorities said yesterday that he had been spotted in West Palm Beach two weeks ago but that they had been unaware that he was in Miami Beach until yesterday . <p> Friends said that Versace , who recently held his fall fashion show in Paris , had intended to continue vacationing in Miami Beach until August . He often walked along the beach alone  --  shunning the use of bodyguards that his sister and business associate , Donatella , favored . Many mornings he left home for the News Cafe three blocks away . Yesterday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bought five magazines for $ 15 and headed for home . <p> After the shooting , paramedics raced to the scene and rushed Versace to the hospital . <p> " It appears there were two entry wounds to the back of the skull , " said Philip Villaneuva , the neurosurgeon who treated Versace at Miami 's Jackson Memorial Hospital where the designer was pronounced dead . " Either one would have been fatal . " <p> The death of Versace  --  whose clothes have been worn by Princess Diana , Madonna , Courtney Love , Elton John , Rod Stewart , Jane Fonda , Kim Basinger and scores of other celebrities  --  sent the fashion industry into mourning . <p> " Gianni Versace , together with a handful of names , symbolizes the success of Italian fashion all over the world , " said compatriot and rival Giorgio Armani . <p> In the fashion world , Versace also made a mark as a designer who did not conceal his sexual orientation and who was known for his outrageous advertising . His death comes two years after the slaying of another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife and four others were arrested earlier this year in connection with that killing . <p> FBI officials have been hunting Cunanan since he became a suspect in the four earlier killings . Last week , the FBI asked its Philippine counterparts to help look for Cunanan , who sometimes claimed to be of Filipino descent and have ties to the country , a Philippine investigator said . <p> Cunanan 's other alleged victims were two friends in the Minneapolis area , a real estate tycoon in Chicago and a cemetery worker in New Jersey . The last victim 's truck was stolen after he was slain . Before authorities identified Cunanan as the suspect in the Versace killing , one of the San Francisco homicide inspectors who looked into Cunanan 's life in the Bay Area said the crime is the sort Cunanan might commit . <p> " This sounds like something Cunanan would do  --  just to get his name back out there , " said San Francisco homicide inspector Armand Gordon , who along with his partner , Joe Toomey , has interviewed numerous people about the handsome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think he likes that sort of recognition , " Gordon said . " He 's playing a game , and he 's very good at it with police . I think he feels he is much more intelligent than we are , and he can basically do whatever he wants to . " <p> Cunanan was last known to be in San Francisco on April 20 . The FBI and San Francisco police said yesterday that none of Cunanan 's Bay Area acquaintances has seen or heard from him since he was linked to the string of deaths . <p> On April 24 , Cunanan gave himself a going away party at California Cuisine , a restaurant in San Diego 's Hillcrest area where he had an apartment . Six friends attended the party . <p> Anthony White , the restaurant 's director who had known Cunanan as a high-tipping patron for several years , said Cunanan told him he was flying to Minneapolis to do some business and then was moving to San Francisco where he had already picked out an apartment . <p> Five days later the body of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was found in the Minneapolis apartment of David Madson , 33 , a former lover of Cunanan . On May 3 , Madson 's body was found near a lake north of Minneapolis . <p> On May 4 , the body of Chicago real estate developer Lee Miglin , 72 , was found in his garage . Five days later , a New Jersey cemetery worker named William Reese , 45 , was slain and his red pickup was stolen . Cunanan has been charged with Madson 's slaying and is wanted for questioning in the others . <p> When White heard Cunanan was being sought by authorities , he said he was shocked . But he recalled there had " always been a lot of questions about what was the real story . Everyone assumed he was a high-priced hooker , but I always assumed he had big money . " <p> White noticed the stories Cunanan told about himself varied greatly . He told the owner of the California Cuisine restaurant that he was Italian and wealthy . He told other people he came from money tied to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though , Cunanan looked very normal , White recalled . " I do n't think I ever remember him wearing Versace . It would have been Ralph Lauren or something else mainstream conservative . He dressed very conservatively  --  khaki pants and a plaid shirt . " <p> When White saw Cunanan , he recalled , he would always be with a group of people , " always fun-loving , laughing and talking , but not in a strange or suspicious way . " <p> OTHER SLAYINGS SINKED TO ANDREW CUNANAN <p> JEFFREY TRAIL  --  Minneapolis police discovered Trail 's bludgeoned body rolled in a carpet in the apartment of architect David Madson on April 29 . The FBI said Trail and Cunanan were lovers and that Trail knew Madson . <p> DAVID MADSON  --  Madson 's body was found May 3 by fishermen on the edge of a lake in Rush City , Minn. , north of Minneapolis . He had been shot three times . Police said Madson and Cunanan once were lovers but that Madson had ended the relationship because he considered Cunanan " shady . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MIGLIN  --  Miglin , a millionaire real estate developer , was found stabbed and slashed in the garage next to his Chicago townhouse on May 4 .
