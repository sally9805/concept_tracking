An intense neon brightness sets the colored-pencil drawings of Charles Biddle apart from other contemporary masters of this medium , medium , colors are immediate , vivid , and the subtleties limitless . <p> For more than 18 years , Charles Biddle has explored an artistic fascination for the nearly bygone neon signs of an American era . Among the artist 's favorites in his native Pennsylvania are a 1950s Bowl-A-Way sign near New Castle , the almost obliterated sign of the closed Ro-Bel Motel in Blairsville , and the sign for the infamous X-Trail Restaurant in Mansfield , where ransom money in the Lindbergh kidnapping case was deposited but never picked up . <p> He usually finds his inspiration in the signs located off interstate highways , often parallel to newer highways , two or three miles from town . For reference , he photographs them with Ektachrome and Kodachrome film , and today his slides number in the thousands . " Although I think of my work as realistic , " Biddle explains , " I use the photograph not as my goal , but as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a second of a subject that is rapidly changing . " <p> Biddle projects the photographic transparency onto drawing paper and makes his initial outline in graphite pencil . He never uses anything harder than 2H and says that anything softer than B produces a line that is too prominent . Ninety percent of his pencils are made by Derwent , which are available in fine and heavier weights . <p> " I use a kneaded eraser to soften and lighten the graphite , and I avoid lines at all cost , " he says . " I prefer Stonehenge heavyweight paper with a fine tooth . I want the movement and texture of the piece to come from the pencil strokes rather than from the paper . " <p> Because Biddle is left-handed , his strokes are backhanded . To avoid smearing or removing any pigment , he starts at the top of the drawing and works down . For maximum opacity , he applies pressure to the pencil , a technique that has formed a callus on his drawing hand . <p> " Hard pressure and paper are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to learn the right amount of pressure to apply before the paper no longer cooperates . I 've never drawn on anything except the best paper I could afford . It 's just too unpredictable otherwise . " <p> The artist achieves a neon quality of brightness as a simple matter of contrast . He works the lighter areas first , layering color two to four times in an opaque manner that completely covers the paper . " The only exception is a pure white area , " he explains . " I am very fastidious about keeping the whites as white as possible and eliminating the original graphite line . Heightened drama results from pressing as much intensity as possible from the dark colors because they increase the excitement in the lighter areas . " <p> Biddle uses pencil because he likes the range of colors . However , to depict the neon lights , he mainly uses yellow and turquoise . He draws for three to four hours , takes a break , and then returns to his drawing board for three to four hours more . A large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete . <p> He works in a small studio in his apartment in Pittsburgh 's East End . For 15 years , he has worked as a framer for Concept Art Gallery , Pittsburgh 's largest gallery , where he has had three solo exhibitions . He has also exhibited at Hammer Galleries in New York City . <p> Biddle dreams of seeing the creation of a sign museum , or at least the establishment of a clearinghouse for history and information about signs . For his part , Biddle has donated his drawing , Modern Cafe , to the Heinz Architectural Center at Pittsburgh 's Carnegie Museum of Art in memory of his father . " Fifty years ago neon signs were an example of the American way of life , " he says . <p> For information on the Colored Pencil Society of America , write to : Ellen Darby , Membership Director , P.O.

DEMONSTRATION : SHENANGO BOWL-A-WAY <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Shenango Bowl-A-Way sign in Shenango , Pennsylvania . Because the artist is left-handle , the drawing was completed from right to left . " I begun with the star , " he say . " It was a good spot to establish scale , intensity , and the proportion of the sign . " <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Step 2 . The drama of the night sky appears across the top of the composition . In the last few years , Biddle has become more aware of natural elements in addition to man-made objects , with sensitivity to varying atmospheric and regional condition . " In the evening , neon signs are at their peak of impact , " says the artist . " and my works celebrates that tension between the natural and the man-made world . " <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Step 3 . Here the first word and lower portions of the sign are completely revealed . Biddle had a sense of excitement upon seeing the first word evolve because it hinted at how the final composition would appear . The areas are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to colored areas . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Step 4 . Again , note how Biddle drew the letters from right to left . He works this way so his hand will not lift or smear the colon He prefers not to use a mahlstick . <p> The finished drawing reflects Biddle 's sense of compositional motion , which might include up to four layers of pencil colors .
