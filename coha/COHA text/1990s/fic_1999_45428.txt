At the end of September I 've had it with life . Life had so fatigued me , and especially such of its components as the drunken mugs of people , the eternal crunch of the subway , shortage of essential goods , lines , quarrels with my wife , summonses to school due to the shocking conduct of my son during recesses , unpaid debts , my secret girlfriend 's ditching me , an aggravated 12-fingered intestinal ulcer , worn-out shoes , violent thugs , the disgusting quality of foodstuffs and , finally , a cemetery-like view of Moscow , that I decided : either I commit suicide or I go somewhere for a rest . <p> After sober meditation I concluded that I lacked good enough reasons for suicide . Then , I managed to wheedle a ten day vacation-at my own expense-out of the authorities and set out for the Black Sea coast . And I 'm lucky that I have a sister working for the railway or , God damn-it , I 'd have been able to get as far as our **35;379;TOOLONG town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invalid . <p> I rented from fishermen a tiny summer cottage about 50 kilometers from Odessa and approximately 10 kilometers from the closest human habitation . More precisely , it was a small hut where the fishermen took cover from bad weather . It had one small window , completely begrimed with flyspecks , a door upholstered in checked oilcloth , three iron bunks and , for some reason , on the wall a portrait of Kirov . I paid off the fishermen in advance with vodka , brought from Moscow and saved for the occasion , since , as I had rightly assumed , money had no value here , and I began living like a hermit , just me and the sea . <p> I would never have thought that solitude could " train " a person as it does , or rather not " train , " but " transform , " and maybe even not " transform " as much as-but I ca n't find a proper verb for this . It appears that solitude is able to return people to their definitive , true organic condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To start with : on the next day of my hermitage I was already going naked , in my birthday-suit , so to speak , and felt marvelous , just as if from birth I had never known clothes . <p> Mornings , I would wake at the crack of dawn , filled to the brim with salty oxygen ; I 'd set water for tea boiling on the pre-historic stove I carry everywhere with me , naked , leave my hut and sit atop an over-turned scow . At that time the sun hung low over the sea and was a perky , pink-orange color , like coals smoldering in the night . But the sea seemed somnambulant , like a man who had just woken , and , speaking figuratively , hardly touched the shore 's sand with the edges of its clothing . There was n't a soul around ; to the right and left there was everywhere an endless , flattened , steppe-like shore , distinguished by gray-yellow sand , a dark , multicolored stripe of pebbles mixed with seashells , the foamy curves of the surf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green mass of the sea ; only gulls , big as chickens , would stroll carefully along the sand and cast questioning glances in my direction , as if estimating to what extent they should be cautious of me . What was I thinking about at that time ? . . . well , about nothing ; my brain had n't fully woken and it was as if something clumsy but pleasant stirred under my hair . <p> The fisherman 's kettle had a whistle and , hearing its call , I would drag myself back to the hut in anticipation of the mysterious delight of drinking tea in solitude . The kettle boiled vigorously , filling the premises with a fragrant and thick steam , and Kirov , as if through whiffs of gunpowder , looked at me from the wall , all puffed-up . I threw a pair of pinches of tea in an unattractive mug with a cover , having doused it beforehand with boiling water , and the shack would instantaneously fill with non-European aromas , among which , it seems , St. John 's wort dominated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again into the air and sit by a painted pillar on which a weather vane with a propeller buzzed fly-like : looking in the direction of the Bosphorus , I would relish my tea and chew the Moscow-baked gingerbread . Meanwhile , the sun was beginning to burn , gulls were circling over the beach contemplating what they could prey on , the surf returned to normal , i.e. without any help from the wind , and made noises , and between them were inanimate gasps such as an automatic door makes opening and closing . What was I thinking about at that time ? At that time I was feeling rather than thinking . And what I did feel , with all that my soul was capable of , was probably the same thing that God-Jehovah felt before life began , namely an infinite , universal solitude which made me sad , majestic , and naughty . I vividly visualized a Jehovah , who sat on the ocean 's shore in approximately the same pose Nikolai Ge used to paint Christ : he sits and , filled with the melancholy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ populate the oceanic , nourishing environment with . And there , quick as a wink , various cuttlefish started to crawl from the water to appear before the creator , one nastier than the next , more absurd-which I suddenly saw so clearly that I jerked in revulsion , although these were my own remote ancestors . So you see what kind of imaginative powers complete loneliness can evoke when there is a steppe behind , in front : the sea , the sun in the sky , on the earth . . . yes , actually , you are just alone on the earth and , you have the feeling that you are entirely alone , like God-Jehovah before life began . <p> Finishing with morning tea , I would smoke a cigarette with gusto , watching the smoke curl , swirl and diffuse , and then I would go bathe and tan until dinner . Near the scow I would arrange a neat place for myself to lie . On the sand I would spread a soldier 's overcoat with a thick nap , which I had discovered under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thin blanket ; under my head I would place a casing from a 200-kilogram German bomb and cover it with a waffle-patterned towel ; on my left I placed cigarettes with matches , on my right , a bound volume of the journal " Science and Life , " dated 1973-and I would fall to the ground like someone knocked off his feet . The sun , figuratively speaking , accepted me in its flaming embrace ; highly heated air enveloped my body in waves , my lungs completely filled with gaseous iodine ; the sand , as if fried in a skillet , smelled like Jurassic sediment , the gulls kicked up a row-and here all of me would fall into a state of dull bliss , practically unknown to modern man . Could it be that I had temporarily left off being human or , just the opposite , daringly had reached for the heavens , attaining some natural essence ? I do n't really know what it was-but it was certainly good . What was I thinking about at that time ? The gist of the matter is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bathing , I did n't bathe much : well , at the most I may have climbed into the sapphire depths three times , and for some reason , exactly at that point my pale continental behind would painfully embarrass me , and I would dive into a roller that was making for the shore , cling to a stone on the bottom and look around : I would see gilded twilight of an olive hue , the cleanest sand , as if the living seaweed and rocks had an architecture of their own-and then I would begin to feel like the primeval cuttlefish , my remotest ancestor , and you know what : this feeling did n't insult me in the least . Sometimes I would float on my back in the water , handing half my body over to the elemental sea , and the other half to sun and atmosphere , and then I really was visited , as they say , by a sensation of amphibiousness . In this way , unconsciously , I played out evolution ; and I find it hard to define what moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would usually emerge from the water on all fours . <p> Meanwhile , dinner time would arrive , around three , when the sun would already burn my skin like a cattle brand , and something dazed , languid and capable of making my eyes scrunch as a bitter taste puckers one 's cheeks , appeared in the noise of the sea ; I would raise myself from my breeding ground and return to the hut to prepare dinner . I would boil water in a large pot , then fill it with a concentrate of vermicelli soup , add a couple of tomatoes , which I would then rub through an aluminum colander , place a small laurel branch in the concoction , a handful of crushed pepper , an onion and , at approximately half past three , was already sitting beside the painted pillar , supporting a wooden cup filled with soup on my lap . In my right hand I had a wooden spoon , in my left , a huge piece of bread ; I gulped down the spicy soup , burning my mouth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would noticeably alter its color in the direction of blue . <p> After dinner , as most Russians do , I would take a nap . I lay on my bunk , situated by the window , took up " Notes Concerning Sherlock Holmes , " but at once the lines would begin interweaving into figures ; my head filled with involuntary images , my body fell into a state of weightlessness ; in a word , a sweet lassitude descended on me and I slept like a log . In the daytime , as a rule , I would dream about nasty things : either I had offended someone or someone had offended me . <p> I would wake somewhere around six . Afterward , I would laze on my bunk for another ten minutes or so , as I had done once , long ago , in far-off childhood , then arrange my tea ceremony again , not acting at all mechanically , but consciously , with a sort of earnestness . After tea accompanied by Moscow-baked gingerbread , I would take off for the overturned scow and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hanging fairly low above the horizon and burning rather politely , delicately ; the gulls had calmed down , as if tired out by the day 's bustle . As for the sea , it had a dirty-blue color and rolled its waves as if fulfilling a certain responsible work . And what was I thinking about at that time ? Well , first of all , at that time a thought just started to peck at my consciousness ; I looked at the foaming waves which crashed into the shore with such hissing-as if the shore were iron made red-hot under the sun 's rays-and , for instance , I thought about an ancient Scythian , who , wandering these shores thousands of years ago , had not been one iota happier than I , if , of course , you understand happiness as a spiritual balance , and spiritual balance as the product of the organized mind ; and I , in my turn , was not one iota happier than the Scythian ; and even if you understand happiness simply as the ability to feel oneself in time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want to , all the same , it 's as plain as the nose on your face that the Scythian had not been one iota happier than I and I not one iota happier than the Scythian . Then what were all those thousands of years , full of suffering and fighting , for ? Well , I clearly and vividly picture this very Scythian riding a small , disheveled horse , which , producing damp sounds , stepped with its hooves along the sand which , through thousands of years , has come down to us in its original form . What 's the Great October Revolution to the sand ? What , after all , is the stock exchange , cybernetics , the Fifth Congress of Soviet Cinematographers to it , when even at the time of King Midas the same possibilities for personal happiness existed with respect to , let 's assume , the understanding of oneself as a petty god ? Or to put it figuratively : you only feel your liver when it begins to hurt , and the ancient Scythian was no more sensitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffering and fighting were definitely required so that some sort of idle thought , not having any connection to the needs of the body , could dawn on a bare-assed Muscovite tormented by so-called real socialism . If that 's so , then fine , because it is reasonable , or to be more exact , accessible to the reason of a normal man . But what if that 's not so , what if at the beginning of time wild Scythians and on the other hand bare-assed eccentrics fixated on their irrelevant thoughts inhabited the earth ? Oh no , let it be so , let this matter look as if a human being were brought up on these very deformities of nature the way an infant is fed cod-liver oil . <p> When I got bored sitting atop the turned-over scow and theorizing with respect to the Scythian , I would take off to wander the surfs edge which formed a zigzag perpendicular to the horizon line . On the right you see the steppe , with its sandy bald spots , islets of wild hemp scantily overgrown with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea , which never bores a land-bound species , due to its alarming , heavy colors and that stirring distance , which no eye can commandand in front , in the same direction , you can see some sort of board , blackened to a stone-coal state , or a jellyfish , immobile at the border of two elements , the dry land and the sea , or some sort of metallic trifle , stimulating historical fantasies , or a dead sturgeon , selfmummified ; in addition to all this , you can smell such a refined odor , it 's as if you 'd have found yourself in some non-Soviet , fairy tale store . And what was I thinking about at that time ? . . here 's what : if you go and go along the border of two elements , the dry land and the sea , it 's possible to walk the circle of the eastern hemisphere ; you set out and here 's Anatolia , beyond it , the birth place of Christianity ; then the Punic lands , the Atlantic coast of Africa , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sumptuous shores of Southeast Asia , our self-destructive shores , which occupy half the world , the fjords of Scandinavia , the lands washed by the North Atlantic 's waters , Gibraltar , the Cote d'Azur , Constantinople and-like a bolt from the blue , again , this very hut in suburban Odessa ! . . . When you complete this excursion around half the world , you will sit by a painted pillar and utter : so what ? That 's just the point : so nothing . And is n't our utterly dark life just like this : we wander along in an allegorical sense from the hut in suburban Odessa to the hut in suburban Odessa , God knows why , meeting on the way a multitude of filth and wonder ; we struggle and suffer , but what 's most important is that we think as if everything rotates around this vicious circle , and have no idea that there is almost nothing or nothing at all to it , that everything is inside us , both the French Riviera and the self-destructive shores , that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colored post , so that you go to another world a happy and distinguished person . In any case , if two or three days after full solitude and contact exclusively with the elements , a deeply land-bound species is capable of feeling its own independent value , then you ca n't treat it unfairly or frighten it because of the circumstances that have come into its life such as a physical existence by a painted pillar . <p> Completing only the most insignificant part of my semicircularworld journey , I would return to the cabin and warm up the remaining soup for supper . Then I would sit beside the painted pillar and , as for some reason natural smells " discharged " by that time and lost their original intensity , a vermicelli-tomato-laurel odor would envelop me , becoming a part of my own atmosphere . I usually carried off the leftovers from supper to the seagulls , and if I accidentally ate everything down to the last crumb , then the seagulls would gather in an excited group beside the German bomb-for some reason always beside the German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving me a piece of their minds : look here , they would say , you , the guy over there , you 've gone too far , you 've absolutely lost your sense of responsibility toward all creatures on the earth . <p> Immediately after supper a most refined time commenced , which is to say , a time for meditation and feeling , a time when the feeling of solitude sharpened to the extreme and something solemnly sad , something rooted in me would begin a direct dialog with nature . . . or with an absolute spirit . . or God knows with what . By then the sun would start dipping into a blue-gray haze which concealed the horizon-line and sent some kind of seductive luminescence over it . In the sky , still bright in the west , but already charged with signs threatening night , the first tiny star would ripen , an evening star resembling a distant diamond tear , which seemed to hang , about to fall any moment now . The sea was peaceful to such an extent that it looked like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very tip would lick the sand the way a child falling asleep licks his lips . The seagulls must have fallen asleep already ; there was no wind at all and , if not for a pair of steppe-crickets chirping in staccato here and there , you could have claimed that universal silence had been established . That was when I established my direct dialog with nature , with either the absolute spirit or God knows what . Let 's assume that my solemn-sad self utters a question which , turns out afterwards , to have been borrowed from a classical author : " Lord , why among thy people are wickedness , disorder and various confusions observed ? Just have a look-see at how well balanced nature is ; so why in the world do we struggle and suffer so much ? " And in answer , the answer is : " The reason is you are utter fools , you sons-of-bitches ! " This explanation , appeared to me , of course , as a fundamental one , but left unclear a certain moment : then why in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us if , all the same , we were utter fools ? The following remark , I would say a contextual one , followed , i.e. it seems to me as if someone were reading the text in my ear : <p> " - What 's up with you-Gregor asked , threateningly peering at him from behind his glasses . - Nothing , sir . The Lord God created light on the first day , and the sun , the moon and the stars on the fourth day . How in the world could the light have shone on the first day ? <p> " Gregor was stunned . The boy mockingly gazed at the teacher . There was something arrogant even in his gaze . Gregor could n't endure it . I 'll show you where from ' - he shouted and furiously struck the student on the cheek . " <p> That 's how I understood it : my almighty interlocutor in a roundabout manner aspired to furnish me with this idea-why interrogate when delight awaits one ? <p> Gradually evening would thicken to the consistency of twilight , a twilight which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called the Milky Way appeared , which pointed surely in some orienting direction . Night encircled me like something inessential , but substantial , material , complex even animated-it seemed as if a huge throng of black angels had spread their velvet wings over me . The one-eyed moon looked point-blank and appeared to be the unseeing orb of night ; the stars seemed luminous parasites ; but the sea-it was like a huge , scaly foot . Night is a creature of incomprehensible structure ; it was the night , putting it figuratively , that embraced me warningly , day after day at about nine o'clock in the evening . What was I thinking about at that time ? . . just between us , about this : that evidently all this had its reason . Since nature from morning to evening does nothing but indulge the organs of my senses and amuses me with living pictures of fairytale performances-and mind you , namely me , since the seagulls along with the crickets can hardly find delight in such-then that means , I am not only nature 's favorite and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am , with respect to the universe something like what Crown Prince Alexander was with respect to his tutor Zhukovsky-strictly speaking , a ruling object . Proceeding from such a consideration , this conclusion mainly follows : in my former life I underestimated myself ; in my former life I used what was of value to me in a crude way , not as it was intended . This attitude of mine was more appropriate to an Amazon savage , who , given a compass , will attempt to split nuts with it or will wear it in place of an earring , or will taste it . It 's interesting that I heard my own breathing at the time these continuous thoughts occupied me . <p> At about ten o'clock I 'd go to bed . I locked the door of the cabin from inside with the handle of a shovel , slowly undressed , then lit the candle tied with twine to the back of the neighboring bunk , and slid under the blanket . At that time I felt a bit uncomfortable ; somehow I felt a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I imagined someone might peek in from outside through my little window any moment . On top of that , at that time the surf would begin its threatening mechanical work , rats would scrape under the floor , the light from the candle streamed an antiquated light , and furthermore , I was reading a frightening work by Conan Doyle : " It was in the spring of the year 1894 that all London was interested , and the fashionable world dismayed , by the murder of the Honourable Ronald Adair , under most unusual and inexplicable circumstances . The public has already learned those particulars of the crime which came out in the police investigation ; but a good deal was suppressed on that occasion .... - my god , what nonsense ! Putting the book aside , I could n't take my eyes from the rectangle of the night sky , visible through the grimy window and within me there arose a miraculous melody which resembled " Luchinnushka " or " Saratov 's Sufferings , " which drove me to a lofty sorrow . What was I thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strange happiness it is to live in our country , among our restless people , strange because , in a way , what kind of happiness is it ; but it is happiness because that is exactly what is called happiness , a life of the sort that when the thought of suicide first starts to haunt you , you go on to settle in a hut outside of Odessa and what 's more , the suicidal idea vanishes into thin stockbroker who would suddenly throw everything to the wind and settle in a sort of kennel somewhere outside Werting , and yet be possessed by tempting ideas at the same time ? Of course not , and we have enough grief as it is , but you see grief is nothing but the language which God has to use when dealing with people .... <p> I would also think that apart from life , in the ordinary sense of this word , there also exists , so to speak , an inner life , a life wrapped inside itself , which has quite a list of curious components . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inner life is what principally distinguishes man from everything else that exists on earth . Second of all , as practice has shown , it is quite simply a marvelous life , if only because of the fact that even should there be grief in it , that grief is of a somewhat refined , acceptable intensity , one of those that inspires . Third of all , you must admit that if inner life is just the kernel , then outer life is just the shell . In a word , it is simply amazing where your thoughts can take you , if one day you come to your senses , if you live a bit like a hermit-just me and the sea . After this , you 'll recall the drunken mugs of people , the eternal crunch of the subway , shortage of essential goods , lines , quarrels with the wife ... - Good lord , what trifles ! <p> The main result of my hermitage was that now I spend half my day sitting in the bathroom-that 's the only place where I really live . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
