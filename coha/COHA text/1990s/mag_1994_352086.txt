In olden days a glimpse of stocking was looked on as something shocking , as Cole Porter noted . But now , God knows , anything goes . And now what 's going is a new wrinkle in hose credited by some fashion experts to Ralph Lauren . In magazine ads , Lauren 's young line , called Ralph , features a model straddling a chair . She wears a skirt about the length of a large handkerchief , and her stockings , such as they are , reach only to her thighs . Thus is born a fad . The stockings are called thigh-highs and a lot of women are making a run on them . <P> Thigh-highs are all over the stores , selling for between $6 and $60 , in black , navy and white , and even plaids , Argyles , fancy lace and silk blends . " It 's a lot of fashion for a little price , " says Kal Ruttenstein , Bloomingdale 's veteran vice president for fashion direction . Comments Benny Lin , Macy 's fashion director : " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well all over . " <P> The new length , which accentuates not so much the stocking as the ample amount of thigh above it , did not spring spontaneously from Lauren 's sketch pad . Its 19th century antecedent is the gartered stocking . In those times , for reasons that probably escape today 's young generations , that fashion was considered disturbingly sexy ( but then , so was the bustle ) . Nowadays , what % women seem to want is unhampered , ungartered , unmitigated eroticism a la Lolita . Underwear is already worn on the outside  --  stuff that looks as if it comes from the lingerie department ( and often does ) , and thigh-highs only complement the picture . <P> What the picture shows is an attempt to look as tarty as possible in an impossibly safe-sex world . " There 's a blurring of the boundary between the taboo and what 's acceptable , " says author Valerie Steele ( Women of Fashion ) , " with a constant testing of deviant or sexual styles . " The effect is that of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found in a child-porn magazine , but suggestive of it nonetheless . <P> Designer Geoffrey Beene , who scrupulously avoids ephemera , says , " I would n't make fun of women by dressing them as children . It 's a trick that has been used by streetwalkers in Paris for years . " That does not seem to bother other rulers of fashion . Karl Lagerfeld likes the style , though he thinks it looks best on women with " runway bodies . " <P> Women also need the nerve to wear only a hint of a skirt to make thigh-highs work ; others need not apply . The question that remains , however , is whether this trend has legs . So far , the answer is yes , though some customers are cautious . Louise Voelker , 26 , a San Francisco sales representative , owns three pairs of thigh-highs and wears them to the office . But she also wears skirts that cover her thighs , so nobody 's the wiser . " The world sees me in one way , " she explains , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be shocked if they knew ! " <P> Meanwhile , a Saks Fifth Avenue salesclerk reports selling a pair of Lauren red plaids to a 64-year-old grandmother who plans to wear them , thighs flashing , with a mini-skirt . That 's more like it . Still , fads being what they are , Grandmother might well be advised to save her panty hose , God knows .
