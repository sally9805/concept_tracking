The rescue seemed bold and sweeping . Only 17 days after taking office last year , President Bush presented a plan to clean up the devastated savings and loan industry once and for all . By August , Congress turned that proposal into law . A new agency , the Resolution Trust Corporation , was formed to sell the assets of hundreds of failed thrifts . Cost to taxpayers : an estimated $166 billion over ten years . Against all odds , the Government was tackling the worst financial disaster since the Depression . <P> Seven months into the cleanup , however , the rescue effort has barely got off the ground . Only 50 of the 386 thrifts taken over by the RTC have been closed or sold . Seized assets are piling up faster than the Government can sell them or even assess their value . By one estimate , the RTC owns 26,800 homes , 773 office buildings , 158 hotels , 205 resorts , 51 restaurants , 236 industrial facilities and 43 mines , among other properties . And the backlog will only get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another 600 institutions . That would bring the total to 1,000 thrifts , twice as many as Bush 's plan estimated . " It 's blowing up in our face , " says an Administration official . " It 's one of those things that 's so bad that nobody wants to talk about it . " <P> The slow start is costing the U.S. an estimated $14 million a day in operating losses and other expenses . Moreover , as seized property slowly deteriorates under Government ownership , its market value is ebbing . The RTC 's commitment to sell several hundred billion dollars ' worth of real estate hangs over the market , depressing prices and even harming the loan portfolios of the remaining 2,600 S &Ls.; And since the Government is counting on proceeds from the property sales to offset some of the costs of the bailout , sluggish disposal of the real estate could help push the total cost of the rescue to more than $300 billion during the next 30 years . " The cost of carrying that stuff is going to kill you and me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrift lawyer . <P> One reason for the delay is the enormous task of building a new bureaucracy . Many RTC offices have only just opened and are operating far below capacity . About 2,300 staffers have been hired and trained so far , but the agency will need thousands more , and finding talented employees has been difficult . " They do a lot of clock watching and bean counting , " says a Houston real estate agent . " Everybody 's so afraid of making a mistake that you ca n't get an answer . It 's a mess . " <P> Many thrift experts attribute the near paralysis to the way Congress  --  at the Administration 's insistence  --  split responsibility for the rescue between two groups . The RTC 's operations are supervised by William Seidman , head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation , an independent agency that polices the banking industry . But a separate panel called the RTC Oversight Board , which is chaired by Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady , decides RTC policy and controls its funding . Congress agreed to give the Treasury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stake in the bailout , but dividing responsibility has prompted feuding between the Treasury and the FDIC . " It is a perfect setup for blaming someone else , " complains Seidman.
