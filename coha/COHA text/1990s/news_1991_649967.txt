##@x <p> The London economic summit meeting ended without the leaders of the Group of Seven committing massive sums of money to prop up the Soviet political system and economy . But American taxpayers should remain vigilant : the Bush and Gorbachev administrations will get together again to look for ways to finance the Soviet future . The U.S. appears more committed to Mr. Gorbachev than to a set of principles . <p> Before the Soviet economy can be reformed effectively , democratic values and methods must be allowed to sink deeper roots . The Gorbachev regime faces a crisis of legitimacy . It does not have popular support . Otherwise , why would President Gorbachev avoid a vote like the one that elected Boris Yeltsin as leader of the Russian republic ? Only with democratically elected leaders does the Soviet Union have a chance of taking the steps necessary to avoid catastrophe , much less to raise its people 's living standard . <p> The old machine of party members , K.G.B . fossils , discredited bureaucrats and elements of the military still holds power , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what needs to be done , especially cutting Government spending . <p> Mr. Yeltsin told U.S. Senators recently that the Russian republic will reduce its payment to the central Government from 70 billion to 25 billion rubles . The result will be a bigger Soviet deficit in addition to a distribution system that has broken down and a G.N.P . in a free fall . The bloated Soviet military not only threatens us , but also the Soviet economy . Military spending has to be cut . Without action , the mammoth deficit will lead to hyperinflation . <p> The leadership also faces a dilemma on internal security . To obtain cooperation on economic reform and to acquire respectability in the community of nations , it must rein in the security forces that murder unarmed citizens in the Baltics and elsewhere . Repression destroys the dreams of freedom and hopes that the Soviets have changed . Citizens who are being persecuted are also unlikely to make economic sacrifices . Yet , once the totalitarian methods go , the political machine itself will be in danger . <p> To prevent national disaster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the grass-roots groups  --  democrats , religious believers , environmentalists , independent trade unionists , entrepreneurs , nationalists and others  --  that have legitimacy but no power . How quickly that transfer occurs and in what form will determine the nation 's future . <p> The recent accord between the presidents of the central Government and the republics represents the beginning , not the end , of conflict . Who controls natural resources ? Who holds power to tax ? Whose laws take precedence ? None of these questions has been answered . Revolutions have been fought over such issues at other times and in other places . It will not be easier for the Soviet Union . <p> Letting markets emerge and function with a pricing mechanism , a banking system and pay based on productivity will do more for the average Soviet family than massive Western aid . For example , the Soviet Union last year lost 100 million metric tons of grain to corruption and inefficiency in the distribution system . Yet , trade in grain is still illegal . In June , over my strong objections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soviet Union to buy four million metric tons of grain . Instead , if the Soviets would decriminalize trade in grain , they would recover far more grain than we give them , without cost to U.S. taxpayers . <p> Now Mr. Gorbachev tells the world that he considers his unelected regime " entitled " to even more aid from U.S. taxpayers . Some in the West have suggested guaranteed loans , subsidized interest rates and guaranteed investment in the Soviet Union . None of that will make much difference to the Soviet future but it will certainly drain the U.S. Treasury . It reminds me of the S. &; L. scandal , except that when things go bad in the Soviet Union we wo n't have a Resolution Trust Corporation to take control of the assets . <p> We could help the Soviets with technical assistance , exchange programs , and an associate membership in the International Monetary Fund , but first we owe them candor . Joining the international economy means tough competition . So long as private property is not protected by law and state monopolies are preserved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We should dispel the illusion that economic reform will be achieved by the shortcut of political deal-making . In an open world economy , capital flows to places with higher rates of return . No President can order U.S. businesses to lose money in the Soviet Union . Only the citizens , laws and institutions of a new society can make it attractive for investment . <p> Finally , we must not undercut our message about democracy with actions that jeopardize legitimate democratic movements , such as those in the Baltic states . The Administration 's support for the Baltics has been limited to feebly reaffirming that the U.S. never legally recognized their annexation into the Soviet Union . <p> If President Bush soon sends a Soviet trade agreement to Congress , we will have a chance to test the sincerity of those words . We have most-favored-nation treaties with all three Baltic nations , but they were suspended in 1951 to prevent the special treatment from rewarding Stalin . Now it is likely that the Administration will ask for that status for the whole Soviet Union . The longstanding agreements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of offending Moscow . If we believe what we say about the Baltics ' separate status , then any trade pact with the Soviets should be accompanied by reinstituting the agreement for the Baltics . <p> The course ahead will be difficult for that continental nation rich in natural resources and human talent . It must be chosen freely by the Soviet people . They are in control of their own destiny . Our influence lies in our willingness to join them in reducing military spending and in the example of our economic and political values  --  not in the size of the check we write to Mr. Gorbachev . @@649967 Favor , South Dakota 1934 <p> They represented all she wanted . <p> They were everything she could never have . <p> The pair caught twenty-four-year-old Emma Spencer 's attention as she made her way home . The way the tall man bent to the sweet little boy at his side , the tenderness in his gesture as he adjusted the child 's hat and straightened his tweed coat brought a sting of unexpected tears to her eyes . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye level , took the boy 's chin between long fingers and smiled as he answered . Even from where she stood , Emma could see strong and assuring depths in his dark eyes . Then he straightened , his expression determined , and stared across the street . <p> Emma ducked , afraid he 'd notice her interest and think her unduly curious . But she could n't resist a guarded look at the pair . <p> The boy took the man 's hand . The man picked up a battered suitcase and they continued on . <p> Emma 's throat closed so tightly that she struggled to breathe . An ache as wide as the Dakota prairies sucked at her thoughts . Just a few steps away , across the wind-swept , dusty street , stood the embodiment of all she longed for  --  a strong , caring man and a dear little child . She mentally shook herself . Although it was not to be , she had no reason to begrudge the fact . She loved being a nurse . She loved helping people . Most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother , struggling to survive the drought and Depression on the farm back home . They depended on the money she sent from her wages each month . She thought of her brother , Sid , and drew in a steadying breath to stop a shiver of guilt . She waited for her lungs to ease and let her usually buried dreams subside into wispy clouds she knew would drift across her thoughts from time to time , like the straw-colored autumn leaves skittering past her feet . <p> The pair turned in at Ada Adams 's boardinghouse and stopped at the front door , side-by-side , tall and straight as two soldiers . She smiled at the way the boy glanced at the man to see if he imitated the stance correctly . <p> The door opened . Gray-haired Ada reached out and hugged them each in turn , then drew them inside . <p> Emma gasped and halted her journey toward the boardinghouse . This must be the nephew  --  a widower  --  Ada expected . Somehow Emma anticipated an older man with a much older son . Truthfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announcement of their impending arrival . She 'd simply been relieved Ada finally decided to get help running the house . The work was far too much for the older woman , suffering from arthritis . Now Emma wished she 'd thought to have asked some questions . How old was the man ? How old his son ? How long was he staying ? What had Ada said happened to his wife ? Ada might have answered all her questions but Emma had been dashing out the door and had n't stopped to listen to the whole story . <p> Emma hesitated , calming her too eager desire to follow this pair . She glanced at her sturdy white shoes . Her white uniform revealed the evidence of a hard day at the hospital . The weather had been cool when she left before dawn and she 'd worn her woolen cape , but now the sun shone warmly and she carried her cape over her arm . <p> She needed a few minutes to collect her thoughts and seek a solution to this sudden yearning . Rather than cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no destination in mind , simply the need to think in solitude . <p> She passed yards enclosed by picket fences . Mr. Blake fussed about his flower beds , preparing them to survive a bitter South Dakota winter . She called a greeting and he waved . <p> Praying silently , she circled the block . Lord , God , You know the road before me . You know I do n't resent my responsibility . In fact , I am grateful as can be for this job and the chance to help my parents . It 's only occasionally I wish for things that might have been . This is one of those times . I thought I had dealt with my disappointment and buried my dreams , but it seems they do n't have the decency to stay dead and buried . Yet I will not fret about it . I know You will give me the strength to do what I must . In Thee do I rejoice . Blessed be Your name . <p> A smile curved her lips as peace flooded her heart . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to face the future , and she would gladly do it . <p> Her resolve restored , she walked back to the boardinghouse . Only for a second did her feet falter as she remembered Ada 's nephew 's dark eyes and the way he smiled at his small son . A tiny sound of disgust escaped her lips . She was n't one to let fanciful notions fill her head . No . She was the kind to do what had to be done . No one and nothing would divert her from her responsibilities . She tipped her thoughts back to her prayer . God would help her . Yet , it might prove prudent to avoid as much contact with the nephew as possible . Certainly they would sit around the same table for meals but apart from that <p> She suddenly chuckled . The man might be unbearably rude or snobbish , even if in those few moments as he encouraged his son , he 'd touched her heart . <p> Her smile flattened . Rogue or otherwise , she need n't worry . He 'd probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her eyes should have been blue to go with her blond hair . Instead she had dark brown eyes , equally dark lashes and brows . Too often people gave her a strange look as if startled by the contrast . She 'd been told many times it gave her a look of determination  --  a woman more suited for work than romance . Yet <p> She pushed away useless dreams , straightened her shoulders and stepped into the warm house . <p> She thought of slipping up the stairs to change , but she would only be avoiding the inevitable . Sooner or later she 'd have to meet the man . Besides , despite the rumpled state of her uniform , wearing it made her feel strong and competent . A glance in the hall mirror , a tuck of some loose strands of hair into her thick bun and she headed into the kitchen . <p> He stood with his back to her . He 'd shed his coat . He was thin as were many people after years of drought and Depression prices . His shoulders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than she 'd thought  --  six foot or better , if she did n't miss her guess . His hair was brown as a warm mink coat . <p> She blamed the hot cookstove for the way her cheeks stung with heat . <p> Ada leaned to the right so she could see past her nephew . " Emma , I told you my nephew , Boothe , was coming . " <p> The man faced her . His eyes were n't dark as she first thought ; they only appeared so because they were deep-set and gray as a winter sky , filling her heart with a raging storm to rival any blizzard she 'd ever experienced . <p> " Boothe Wallace . " Ada 's voice came like a faint call on a breeze as Emma 's emotions ran the gamut of longing , loneliness and finally into self-disgust that she could n't better control her thoughts . <p> " Boothe , this is one of my guests , Emma Spencer . " <p> Emma , her feelings firmly under control , stepped forward but halted as his expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pausing at the blotch where she 'd tried to erase evidence of a young patient 's vomit . <p> She wished she 'd taken the time to change . " I 'm sorry , " she murmured , forcing the words past the blockage in her throat . " I just got off work . " <p> " A nurse . " Boothe 's words carried a condemning tone , though Emma could think of no reason for it . She 'd given him no cause to object to anything she 'd done or not done . <p> " She works at the hospital , " Ada explained . " And this little fellow is Boothe 's son , Jessie . " <p> Boothe showed no sign of moving over to allow Emma to meet the boy , so she stepped sideways . Jessie perched on the table . He gave her a shy , glancing smile , allowing her a glimpse of startlingly blue eyes . She wanted to sweep the adorable child into her arms . She wisely restrained herself . She loved working with children best . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy wore an almost new shirt of fine cotton and knickers of good quality wool . Compared to his father 's well-worn clothes , Jessie was dressed like a prince . <p> " I 'm happy to meet you , Jessie , " she said in the soft tone she reserved for children and frightened patients . " How old are you ? " <p> He darted another glance at her and smiled so wide she ached to ruffle his sandy-colored hair . " Six . " His voice had a gritty sound as if he wanted everyone to forget he was a little boy and think he was a man . <p> That 's when she saw the deep slash on his arm and the blood-soaked rag that had recently been removed . " You 've been hurt . What happened ? " Instinctively , she stepped forward , intent on examining the wound . <p> " Ran into a sticking out nail . Daddy got really mad at the man pushing the cart . " He gave the cut a look , shuddered and turned away , but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wound had to hurt like fury . It was deep and gaping , but a few stitches would fix it up and he 'd heal neatly as long as he did n't get an infection  --  and unless it was properly cleaned , he stood a good chance of just that . Dirt blackened the edges of the cut . " I 'll clean it for you , and then your father can take you to the doctor . " <p> But before she reached Jessie 's side , Boothe stepped in front of her . <p> " No doctor . No nurse . " His harsh tone sent a shudder along Emma 's spine . " I 'll take care of him myself . " His stubborn stance was a marked contrast to the tenderness he 'd exhibited a short time ago on the street . <p> She thought she must have misunderstood him . " It needs cleaning and stitching . I can do the former but a good doctor should do the latter . " Again she moved to take over the chore . <p> Again he blocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my son . " <p> The challenge in his eyes felt like a spear to her heart , but she would n't let it deter her . " Your son needs medical attention . " <p> " I do n't need the bungling interference of either a doctor or a nurse . " He 'd lowered his voice so only Emma heard him . <p> She recoiled from the venomous accusation . " I do not bungle . " <p> He held his hand toward her , palm forward , effectively forbidding her to go any farther . <p> She clasped her hands at her waist , squeezed her fingers hard enough to hurt and clamped her mouth shut to stop the angry protest . How dare this man judge her incompetent ! But even more , how could he ignorantly , stubbornly , put his son at risk ? Too many times she 'd seen the sorry result of home remedies . She 'd seen children suffer needlessly because their parents refused to take them to the doctor until their injuries or illnesses pushed them to the verge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late . <p> He turned back to his aunt . " Would you have a basin ? " <p> Ada 's eyes were wary as if wondering if she should intervene then she gave a barely perceptible shrug , pulled one from the cupboard and handed it to him . <p> Boothe 's demanding gaze forbade Emma to interfere . When he seemed confident she 'd stand back , he turned to his son . " Jessie , I 'm going to clean this and then I 'll bandage it . " <p> Boothe filled a basin as Emma helplessly looked on . It took a great deal of self-discipline to stand by when little Jessie sent her a frightened look as if begging her to promise everything would be okay . Unfortunately , she could n't give such assurance . The wound continued to bleed . One good thing about the flow of blood  --  it served to cleanse the deeper tissues . <p> Boothe dipped a clean cloth in the water . Jessie whimpered . " Now , son . I wo n't hurt you any more than I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodded and blinked back tears . <p> " You be a brave man and this will be done sooner than you know . " <p> Jessie pressed his lips together and nodded again . <p> Emma admired the little boy 's bravery . She watched with hawk-like concentration as Boothe cleaned the edges of the wound . He did a reasonably good job but it did n't satisfy Emma . She itched to pour on a good dose of disinfectant . Iodine was her first choice . She 'd never seen a wound infect if it 'd been properly doused with the potent stuff . She opened her mouth to make a suggestion but Boothe 's warning glance made her swallow back the words . The boy would have a terrible scar without stitches , and the wound would keep bleeding for an unnecessarily long time . <p> " Aunt Ada , do you have a clean rag ? " Boothe asked . Ada handed him an old sheet . <p> No , Emma mentally screamed . At least use something sterile . " I could get dressings from the hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This will do just fine . " He tore the fabric into strips . <p> Anger , like hot coals to her heart , surged through her . How could this man be so stubborn ? Why did he resist medical help with such blindness ? <p> Ignoring her , though he could n't help but be aware of her scowling concern , he pressed the edges of the wound together and wrapped it securely with the cloth , fixing the end in place with the pin Ada handed him then stepped back , pleased with his work . <br> Continues ...
