<p> As an anchor for an all-news radio station for five years , Sue Castorino covered dozens of news conferences and speeches and realized many politicians , corporate executives and athletes lacked communication skills . <p> While covering locker rooms from Iowa City to Wrigley Field to Churchill Downs for 20 years , Randy Minkoff interviewed many college and professional athletes who could n't put a subject , verb and adjective in proper sequence . <p> That was before sports-talk radio and sports bars became popular , before sound bites , before locker rooms were opened to 50-watt radio stations and weekly newspapers , before ambush journalism , before professional agents turned their slam-dunking clients into talking cash registers . <p> Some say it began after Georgetown won the NCAA basketball championship in 1983 , when a television reporter thrust a microphone in Patrick Ewing 's face and elicited nothing but mumbles . For a few years afterward , Georgetown coach John Thompson refused to allow his players to be interviewed by the media . <p> Some say it began when ESPN , the sports entertainment network , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bodybuilding into prime-time events . <p> For Castorino and Minkoff , it all began in 1988 when they founded " The Speaking Specialists , " a Chicago-based company that advertises a comprehensive , personalized and cost-effective program for dealing with the news media in the 1990s . <p> " What is the answer you want to see on the 10 o'clock news ? " Castorino said . " That 's what we do . We do n't tell them what to say but we give them direction . " <p> The husband-wife team specializes with colleges  --  coaches , athletes , administrators , marketing and promotional personnel . They list nearly 40 colleges , including Illinois , DePaul , Illinois-Chicago , Notre Dame , Bradley , Georgetown , Texas and Tennessee , among their clients . They also have worked with the Cubs , White Sox , Nike , McDonald 's , Ameritech and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange . <p> In the future , they hope to expand their business to include high schools . They have had several inquiries from colleges suggesting that they should work with young athletes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habits . " <p> " The trick is to convince kids that we are n't in the business just to make them look good in front of a camera , " Minkoff said . " What we found is a lot of freshmen and sophomores are afraid to speak up in class and their grades suffer . <p> " They wo n't play sports forever . We want them to be able to communicate after sports , when they interview for jobs . We feel high school students are an important market . " <p> Castorino and Minkoff advise clients on how to respond to tough questions ( " Do you think P.J. Carlesimo is a racist coach ? " ) and dumb questions ( " How do you feel ? " ) and prepare 20-year-olds for the media circus that surrounds high-profile college programs . <p> " Our object , " said Minkoff , who covered politics and sports for United Press International until the early 1980s , then covered sports on radio for WBBM and WGN until 1996 , " is we want students to be more comfortable talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when talking to the media and know how to go after a job after their career in sports is over . <p> " It is communication , not just to make them look good on camera . We want them to be confident and ( able to ) converse , be able to put together intelligent responses . Sure , image is important . But so is substance . " <p> While covering politicians and athletes , Castorino and Minkoff noticed many of them simply were n't prepared for the media spotlight . <p> " Because sports journalism has become so competitive , there are people who are trying to top everyone else , get an angle no one else has and elicit a controversial response . Some athletes and coaches get aggravated and intimidated . " <p> They have seven VCRs running constantly , taping one television interview after another . They show the tapes to their clients to demonstrate poor interviews and what they can do to become better communicators . <p> " We want them to understand that they are n't victims , that the media in most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can take control of the situation , " said Castorino , a former news anchor at WBBM-AM . <p> " This is n't ' 60 Minutes ' . Sure , it is scary when the camera goes on . And they will be asked smart questions and dumb questions . But they must learn to stay focused regardless of the question or where they think the question is going . " <p> Clients worry about how they will be perceived on the air . How will I handle my emotions ? Will I cry ? What if I open my mouth and nothing comes out ? What do I do if I freeze ? Will I be too nervous ? Should I inject some humor ? What if he asks a really tough question ? Should I say " no comment ? " What will my coach or teammates think ? <p> " The worst thing is to go on and on . Rambling is the biggest sin , " Castorino said . " People still ramble . They are n't able to get to the point , to say what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ athletes . " <p> How do you stop doing it ? How do you become a good interview subject ? <p> " What is the most important thing you want a reporter to know ? What do you want to see on the 10 o'clock news ? " Castorino said . " TV ca n't use a wonderful answer if it is 60 seconds long . " <p> Do 's and don'ts to remember : <p> Be cooperative . Reporters need your comments for stories . If you make yourself available to answer their questions , they will appreciate it because it makes them look more professional . <p> Do n't be defensive . Attitude is everything . Stay calm . Remain in control in all situations . <p> Think before you answer . Reporters are often in a hurry because of deadline pressures . Do n't feel rushed into giving quick answers . Speak clearly . Avoid cliches . <p> Do n't trash the opposition . <p> Avoid " no comment . " It makes you look as though you have something to hide . Try to find a response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Make sure you understand the question before you answer . If you do n't understand , ask for clarification or have the interviewer repeat the entire question . <p> If you do n't know , say so . Talk about what you do know , do n't talk about what you do n't know . <p> No " off the record " comments . Everything you say is quotable . If you do n't want your words to show up in tomorrow 's newspaper , do n't say them . You are always on the record with a reporter . <p> Personal appearance counts . Maintain good eye contact with the reporter and do n't worry about the camera . Keep your voice strong and animated . Do n't chew gum or wear a cap . <p> Personalize . In one-on-one interviews , use the reporter 's first name . It helps you take control and makes you sound more confident and conversational . <p> Say " thanks . " Your final actions in an interview may leave the strongest impression with the reporter . Make every encounter a memorable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the future . <p> " No matter what you do in college , whether you are a star athlete or a reserve , sooner or later you must be in some communicative situation , " Minkoff said . " Whether you are trying to get a job or trying to persuade someone to get into your business , these are skills you will need . "
