Lonely ( and billowy ) as a cloud , Ralph Jones ( John Goodman ) wanders the halls of Buckingham Palace in his satin Green Bay Packers jacket . He has a problem : How can a Las Vegas lounge performer master the art of kingship after a rather silly accident has wiped out all the more logical candidates for the job ? Peter O'Toole as Willingham , his private secretary , keeps humming a few bars of the right tune . But a regal song is just not one Ralph can fake . <P> Prickly as porcupines , Deborah and Nick Fifer ( Bette Midler and Woody Allen ) wander the aisles of a shopping mall that probably exceeds Ralph 's palace in square footage , confessing infidelities and trying to patch up a marriage that only this morning looked as solid as the British monarchy . They are constantly distracted by the consumerism bustling around them and by a mime ( Bill Irwin ) who is as nosy as he is silent and maybe the most amusing thing about the film . <P> Both King Ralph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a Mall ( directed by Paul Mazursky from a screenplay he wrote with Roger Simon ) offer their stars the kind of discombobulating contexts their well-established characters need to function funnily . But curiously enough , it is the film with the more outrageously improbable premise that works best . As the man who would n't be King if he could help it , Goodman redeems what might have been just another high-concept comedy for the party of humanity . Despite the fact that they are working a much more subtle idea  --  an attempt to resolve a private crisis in an impersonally public place  --  Midler and Allen rarely attain believability , let alone sympathy , as the troubled pair of getters and spenders . <P> This is partly a matter of image . Goodman has become our designated Everyman , a Ralph Kramden for the ' 90s but without the splenetic splutter of Jackie Gleason 's immortal creation . An intelligence , a sensitivity he ca n't quite articulate , just possibly a slight sadness , lurk behind Goodman 's eyes , and they ground everything he does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is our great show-biz floozy , and Allen personifies the anxious urban intellect . It is hard to insert their screen personas into the kind of normal , middle- class lives they are supposed to inhabit here . They require highly stylized vehicles in order to do their best work . Lacking that , neither they nor the audience knows quite what to make of these figures . Are they supposed to be the objects of satire or affection ? <P> In other words , neither the actors nor Mazursky , whose gift for portraying middle-class muddles ( Down and Out in Beverly Hills ) is unquestioned , achieves the kind of confident relationship with their material that Goodman and Ward enjoy . Goodman is terrific in his big comic set pieces ( notably a decorum- shattering rendition of Good Golly Miss Molly at a royal ball ) . But even in those he avoids the temptation to broad farce . He and Ward trust themselves to go for something sweeter and more wistful , the tone of the fabulist , and they sustain it with near perfect pitch .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
