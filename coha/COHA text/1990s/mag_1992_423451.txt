THE RUNNING MAN <p> I cover the Robbins campaign . I traverse the Robbins trail . The Robbins people keep me apprised of every Robbins movement , and Robbins is the sort of man who never stops moving . I 'll sleep when I 'm forty-five , ' Robbins has said , meaning he will be awake for another eleven years . But that is Robbins for you - always awake , always vigilant , always tired . He can not sleep while our democracy crumbles . Everywhere he sees lies and corruption , apathy and hate . Other men might avert their gaze . But Robbins is not other men , except when he is acting , at which times he is paid to be other men , occasionally horrible men , the very sort of men whose existence has forced Robbins to step forward and lead us from a plight that deadens our souls . Clearly , it is time for a change , the kind of change only an actor is capable of bringing to our attention . If Timothy Robbins is not that actor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now I will tell you what I know of Robbins , because it is your right to know everything ; about this ( and all else ) Robbins feels strongly : Information is n't readily available in our society , ' he has often said . We have a secret government , and as long as that exists we 're not living in a democracy . ' Under these constrictions , alas , Robbins feels obliged to limit what he says about himself and has done so throughout this election year , while promoting such film projects as Robert Altman 's Player ( for which he won Best Actor at the Cannes Film Festival ) and the deft political satire Bob Roberts , which Robbins himself triumphantly wrote , directed and starred in . For a man with a message , he opts to be something of an enigma . You ca n't take yourself too seriously , ' he likes to say , sounding as serious as a ruptured aorta . ( No one is more serious about not taking himself seriously . ) When you 're talking about society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule by which he lives , you always have to approach it with a sense of humor . ' <p> Naturally , heated speculation dogs Robbins : What exactly does he want ? Can he go the distance ? Just how far is the distance ? Will he need transportation ? What about agriculture ? Here is a campaign dossier that sheds better light on the Robbins juggernaut . After all , a body politic must first understand its actors if it has any hope of understanding itself . <p> <p> TIM ROBBINS HAS THE DICKHEAD THING . LIKE NO ONE else in our current crop of actors , he excels at playing dickheads . A conscientious professional , he has lately chosen to play anti-heroes so that we may better grasp the subtleties of evil . As The Player 's slick Hollywood weasel Griffin Mill and as the title folk-singing , neo-Fascist candidate in Bob Roberts , Robbins manages to be at once contemptible and attractive - the rarest of gifts . He is darkness cloaked in light , a metaphor for his vision of all bureaucracy . I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' he says . Beware of smiling assholes and fat-cat politicians . At least as a movie character I do n't have the fate of the Western world in my hands . ' <p> <p> HIS HANDS ARE LARGE AND HAVE PRESSED MUCH FLESH . Stumping for Bob Roberts , Robbins has been everywhere , always avidly pursued by media corps . Never subdued , he scolds the press at every turn for burying truth and eroding freedom . The media is complicit , ' he says . The national press and the national government are in bed together , ' he told Buzz magazine . He rankles over these offenses and has been known to abruptly end interviews that trivialize him by focusing on his relationship with actress Susan Sarandon , the mother of his two young sons . I never signed anything that said I give up my privacy when I become famous , ' he told the New York Times . Luckily , his admonishments are full of evident good humor , because that is the way he chooses to approach life . <p> <p> I CATCH UP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my New York hotel room and says he is waiting downstairs . ( He is the kind of man who comes to you . ) I find him tall , when I find him , and pleased by his height . I get to see who dyes their hair , ' he says , ever the truth seeker . But Robbins looks down on others only in the literal sense . He is , after all , a man of the people who still makes his home in Greenwich Village , the bohemian cradle from which he sprang . ( He and Sarandon also keep a country home in New York 's Westchester County , where he is learning to live without din . ) Indeed , he has the look - if not the demeanor - of any large goofball , attired in the standard goofball summer garb of big shorts , big T-shirt , jacket tied around waist and backward baseball cap . In conversation he is friendly but never expansive , unless something has outraged him . He speaks slowly and has no ability for small talk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her first . ( Even then , such prying renders him mopey . You 'd have to ask her , ' he responds to the mildest of these inquiries . ) If quizzed pointedly , though , he is quick to identify her as Louise , not Thelma . Moreover , he swears to have seen every Sarandon film except The Hunger , in which she performed lesbian-vampire sex with Catherine Deneuve . I do n't know why I have n't seen it , ' he says with a short laugh . His laugh is always thick and cynical , and it comes often . <p> <p> ROBBINS IS HAPPIEST WHEN HE OFFENDS . HE THRILLS to reports of conservatives who grumble at Bob Roberts screenings . Who was offended ? ' he eagerly asks a spy dispatched to one such event . Tell me , tell me ! I love hearing this stuff ! ' Perhaps his most cherished endorsement has come from acerbic author Gore Vidal , who pronounced Robbins a dangerous man ' upon reading the Bob Roberts screenplay . When contacted at his refuge in Italy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangerous territory by writing in a rather realistic way about our system . . . since political movies do no business . ' <p> Nevertheless Vidal leapt to appear in the film , as the aging liberal Pennsylvania senator who is unseated by right-wing caricature Roberts . Vidal , an old friend of Sarandon 's , bears further witness to the Robbins phenomenon : For twenty years I have met all Susan 's gentleman callers , and of the lot Tim is really the bright kid . We 'd talk politics , and he was n't dumb about it like most actors . You know , an actor on politics - I mean , I leave the room ! They give you lots of emotion and no substance at all . But he knows how the whole thing works . Oh , that brain is working . ' <p> <p> WHO IS BOB ROBERTS ? BOB ROBERTS IS TIM 'S NIGHTMARE projection of himself , ' says his friend Adam Simon , with whom Robbins has written derisive plays for the Actors ' Gang , an L.A.-based renegade theater troupe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bob is his doppelganger shadow , ' Simon says , Tim 's worst fear of what he might have become . ' According to Robbins , Bob is young George Bush with a guitar . ' As per legend , Robbins conceived Bob as a folk-singing yuppie , the subject of a 1986 Saturday Night Live short film . That Bob was comparatively harmless , little more than an arrogant jerk who ended sentences with capeesh ? ' and wore noisy clothes . Says Robbins , Bob was much hipper then . ' <p> For the big screen , Bob became insidious , a millionaire politician with a major recording career . Bob 's folk songs heckle oppression and celebrate greed . Sample lyrics from This Land Was Made for Me ' ' : So what 's wrong with ambition ? What 's wrong with enterprise ? / The time has come to take as much as I can get . ' Bob 's warped catalog was composed by Robbins and his brother , David , who come by their muse honestly ; their father , Gil Robbins , sang folk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My father used to say , If anyone ever tells you that you ca n't sing , sing louder , ' ' says Robbins , who as Bob sings with blissful bravado , a pin-striped Dylan . Even so , he says he held back in the film . I can sing better than Bob Roberts , ' he states confidently . Ready to prove it , he threatens : Bob just might go electric in the sequel . Hmmm , Metal Bob . . . ' <p> <p> TO BEAT CROWDS , WE ATTEND THE DEMOCRATIC National Convention a week before it happens . On the sidewalk outside Madison Square Garden , a shill hands Robbins a free pass to the Paradise Club , NYC 's Only Totally Nude Club , Hundreds of Beautiful Girls , Daily Free Hot Buffet . ' Look , ' he mutters , studying the pass . The Democrats are working their image . ' Robbins , it turns out , is down on the Democrats for abandoning Jerry Brown but says he 'll vote defensively ' for Bill Clinton . ( I 'm basing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' he insists . ) Fortunately , inside the Garden his spirits are buoyed by the sight of workmen erecting platforms and lifting chairs . ( It is always reassuring to watch democracy primp itself . ) I wonder if C-SPAN is covering the fights over where the carpets will be nailed down , ' he says expectantly . A Garden official conducts us through the patriotic festoons , wearily noting , We 're still feeling the aftershocks of that Cher cancellation last month . ' Here , Robbins perks up . What was the real story behind that ? ' he asks suspiciously . There is no bottom line Robbins wo n't plumb . Likewise , at the UPI booth he confronts a reporter and asks : Is UPI going to be bought by Pat Robertson ? What a mistake that would be . ' Later we sit in the great arena and consider the pomp sprawling before us . All that carpet ! ' he says , after which he need say no more . <p> <p> BUT WHERE DOES ROBBINS STAND ? HERE IS A REVIEW of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rookie goofball hurler Nuke LaLoosh in Bull Durham , a role he initially found unsuitably frivolous . ( We see him pitching in a garter belt . ) Says director Ron Shelton , I remember saying to him , Tim , Nuke has to read his comic books with the same fervor that you read your political manifestoes , ' and then he started submitting to it . ' ( On this film , he would meet Sarandon , twelve years his senior , who played a scholarly baseball groupie ; their celebrity romance promptly ensued . ) Throughout his screen tenure , however , impressive acting efforts were largely defeated in moribund projects like Jacob 's Ladder , Cadillac Man , Five Corners , Erik the Viking and Miss Firecracker . Minor stains on his reputation include sightings in Howard the Duck and Fraternity Vacation , which he calls your typical **39;1481;TOOLONG kind of movie . ' All along , much of his earnings have gone to support his beloved Actors ' Gang , itself an outgrowth of Robbins 's UCLA intramural softball team , the Male Death Cult . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roberts , made for a meager $4 million , he gave away his paltry salary to pay other actors , then refused to release a soundtrack album - a sure-fire moneymaker - for fear conservatives would misappropriate Bob 's sly anthems . I wound up making no money on this film , ' Robbins confesses to me , almost proudly . On the other hand I have two more months , then I 'm broke . ' <p> <p> HE LIVES IN SIN , WITH NO APOLOGIES . ROBBINS TREADS tensely on the subject . I would rather be private , not only for the sake of my family , ' he says , but for the sake of our relationship . Personal feelings should be for the person that you 're feeling them for . Any time you start seeing couples showing up on covers of magazines , it 's only a matter of time before they 've had it . ' At the same time he has nothing to hide . There is no dirt , ' he insists . There is no dirt . There is no dirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TO BE A FUN guy . One evening he proves this by allowing himself to be seen playing softball . He beckons me out to Westchester , to the neutral ground of Chappaqua 's train station , where he meets me in a chauffeured Town Car that he 's hired for the night . ( Sarandon has their Volvo wagon at the nearby summer home . ) Desperate for competition , he has arranged to join a team of men he does n't know ( I 've never met these guys before - they are n't the people I regularly play with , ' he says ) . The team is the Spambones , comprised mostly of well-heeled businessmen and doctors , with little notion of the actor 's fame . Since league rules prohibit outsiders , Robbins will play in the guise of Dave Slavek , a guy on the roster who never shows up . You 're sworn to secrecy , ' he informs me . I have a bat ; I will use it . ' Indeed , he has brought along his own war club as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's gon na get ugly , ' he frets upon eyeing the opposition , a squad of uniformly fearsome types in black who call themselves the Bombers . I think they 're convicts , ' he says . <p> In the end , the Bombers prevail , 17-5 . Spambone third-basemen Slavek ( fine arm , good hands ) goes one-for-three , with an infield single and a sacrifice fly ( good contact ) , one RBI . Afterward he rides home in a sullen funk . I 'm just hungry , ' he explains . I get cranky when I 'm hungry . ' But it is clear that he does not like to lose and that he was not meant to lose . When the car stops , he bolts and disappears down a leafy ravine to the simple house where his loved ones await him . <p> <p> ONCE A MAN IS GONE , ALL THAT REMAINS are his beliefs - and also his personal effects . For certain , Robbins will have much to leave behind , especially if he begins to invest now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before . So he will persist , direct more films , appear in others ( including Altman 's forthcoming Shortcuts and Hudsucker Proxy for the Coen brothers ) . He will make a difference or die trying . He says : In moments of despair there 's always hope to be found . It 's there for the taking in America . If you want to change things , you can - it 's set up that way , although it may not be for long . If that means organizing and running for local office , so be it . ' And so , doubtless then , he will soon seek election ? No , that 's not my job , ' he says , recoiling at the suggestion . I do n't have the patience for that ! I could n't imagine it . ' He shakes his head incredulously . I mean , talk about humorless professions .
