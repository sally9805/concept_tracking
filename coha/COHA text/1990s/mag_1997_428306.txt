<p> " A pound of body fat is supposedly about 3,500 calories . About how big would that be if it were shaped into a cube ?  --  K.S. , CHEEKTOWAGA , N.Y . <p> <p> " THINK OF IT AS FOUR sticks of butter , " says Tina Ruggiero , a registered dietitian in New York City " Butter is pure fat , so that 's a realistic comparison . " If you insisted on molding the fat into an actual cube ( a messy operation ) , you 'd have a block of blubber about 4 to 5 inches tall . <p> So why does n't someone who is 10 pounds overweight have a basketball-size mass jutting out from his midsection ? " Body fat is n't stored just underneath your skin , " says Ruggiero . " It 's dispersed throughout your body , cushioning and surrounding your organs . Genetics plays a big factor as to where you 'll put excess fat when you gain weight . " Add a Side of Beef <p> I 've been working out with weights for three years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upper body is a lot more developed than my left , so I look lopsided . What could be causing this ? I use dumbbells for all my exercises  --  same weight on both sides  --  and am left-handed.  --  J. P. , PISCATAWAY , N.J. <p> <p> The cause could be a few different things , says Linn Goldberg , M.D. , professor of medicine and chief of the division of health promotion and sports medicine at Oregon Health Sciences University . One possibility is that even though you do the same number of sets and repetitions on each side , the left side of your upper body is coordinating nerve and muscle impulses more efficiently and therefore does n't need to work as hard to lift the weight . <p> Another possibility is that , due to a congenital or viral condition , certain nerves that would enable your left-side muscles to grow have been damaged , says Dr. Goldberg . Many viruses , such as polio , can have this effect on specific nerves . <p> No matter the cause , the solution is the same . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Dr. Goldberg . Increase the weight by 20 percent on the scrawnier side , he suggests . Since you 're using dumbbells , this should be an easy change to make and it will stimulate the muscles on the smaller side to grow more . Or switch to a lower-weight , high-repetition workout using equal weight on both sides , says Dr. Goldberg . By emphasizing tone over muscle bulk , you 'll smooth out much of the difference . Timely Relief <p> I do n't get a lot of headaches , so I 've had the same bottle of ibuprofen for years . Is it dangerous to take if the expiration date is past ? What about multivitamins ?  --  R.D. , COEUR D'ALENE , IDAHO <p> <p> Expiration dates are there for a reason , says Loyd V. Allen Jr. , Ph.D. , chairman of the department of medicinal chemistry and pharmaceutics at the University of Oklahoma . While it 's not likely that your pain reliever or multivitamin will degrade into something toxic shortly after the expiration date , it is possible . And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chance you 're taking . " Spend the three bucks for a new bottle , " says Allen . <p> While we 're on the subject , Allen also emphasizes that those expiration dates are generally based on the product being stored in a dark , cool , dry place . If your aspirin bottle is constantly exposed to light , heat or humidity ( which is exactly the climate you find on a steamy bathroom counter ) , the medicine could degrade much faster . " The worst place to store anything is in a bathroom , " says Allen . The refrigerator is a bad idea as well , because it 's humid inside , causing certain medicines to crystallize or crack . " A linen closet is a much better idea , " he says . Fear of Public Squeaking <p> Is there any way to make the bottom of my shoes stop squeaking ?  --  M.K. , ENCINITAS , CALIF . <p> <p> Shoes squeak for one of three reasons , says Carl Barone , owner of Carl 's Shoes in Moorestown , New Jersey . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoe 's soles has begun to break down . In this case , you 'll have to replace the soles , an operation that usually costs around $40 . <p> Another possibility is that the steel shank ( beneath the instep ) is loose or defective . The metal squeaks every time it moves  --  basically every time you take a step . This can usually be fixed for $6 or $7 . " It occasionally happens because the shoe 's defective , " says Barone , " so you might ask the manufacturer to pay . " <p> Finally , the noise might be caused by the shoe tongue rubbing where the shoes are laced . In this case , just apply some saddle soap between the surfaces to minimize friction and silence the squeaking . For the Long Run <p> I 'm running my first marathon in a few weeks . I know you ca n't predict the weather , but can you help me decide what to wear to be more comfortable for the 26 grueling miles ?  --  Z.D. , NEW YORK , N.Y . <p> <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours through a jungle of concrete with a pack of sweaty , obsessed heavy breathers , and you 're worried about being " comfortable " ? <p> Forget comfort , pal , and focus on survival . That means controlling your climate throughout the race . " Most guys overheat in the early miles , which saps their energy and leads to dehydration , " says Amby Burfoot , editor of Runner 's World magazine and the winner of the 1968 Boston Marathon . " Or , around the 20-mile mark , they cool off and start to cramp up . " He recommends wearing a lot of stuff you can throw away . You 'll probably have to stand around for a couple of hours before the marathon starts , so stay warm by piling on old , unwanted clothing . Then discard it during the race as you heat up . ( Do n't worry about littering . " Many cities collect the clothes and distribute them to shelters , " Burfoot says . ) <p> The recommended attire : a polypropylene mesh shirt ( which you 'll keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( a keeper , too ) ; synthetic socks ; cotton socks to wear as gloves ; and an old wool cap . Regulate your body temperature by using the cap to cover your ears and back of your neck for warmth ( at the start of the race ) ; covering just your ears as you warm up ( the first few miles ) ; then taking the cap off as necessary during the remainder of the race . Important note : Do n't toss the hat . If you have to slow down or walk , you 'll need it to stay warm and help keep your muscles from cramping , since up to 80 percent of your body heat is lost through your upper story . <p> Two more fashion secrets : Put Band-Aids on your nipples and rub Vaseline in your armpits , on your thighs and in your crotch . These will help prevent chafing . <p> Last , if it 's raining or threatening to rain , don a plastic garbage bag with holes cut in the bottom and sides for your head and arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for change for the cab ride to the finish line . ) How to Dodge a Paunch <p> I 'm in my late 20s and still have a fairly flat stomach , but below my navel  --  in the pelvis area  --  I look paunchy . Can ab exercises help me ? If not , what can I do ?  --  W. S. , PITTSBURGH , PA . <p> <p> Ab exercises can help , says Rich Baretta , a personal trainer at the Equinox Fitness Club in New York City . But the key to losing the paunch is to strengthen your lower abs . Here 's an exercise that will help you do it : <p> Lie on your back , keeping your arms close to your sides , palms facedown and just under your butt . Extend your legs straight , with your heels about 3 inches off the floor . " Focus on pressing your lower back into the floor , " says Baretta . Now , bring your knees toward your chest , tilting your pelvis toward your rib cage . Point your toes skyward as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then straighten your legs to the starting position and repeat , keeping your lower abs taut throughout the exercise . Do three sets of 8 to 12 repetitions . The Power of Potassium <p> I 've read that increasing the amount of potassium in my diet will help lower my blood pressure . Exactly how much potassium do I need ? Do I have to eat 20 kiwi-fruits a day ?  --  B.N. , LUBBOCK , TEXAS <p> <p> " Potassium can help lower some people 's blood pressure , " says Robert Hackman , Ph.D. , of the University of California at Davis . To see if potassium can help you , doctors suggest that you take in around 3,500 milligrams ( mg ) of potassium a day . <p> Sixteen kiwifruits will do it , but there is an easier way . Just shoot for four to five servings a day of potassium-rich foods , suggests Hackman . A single baked potato , with skin , has a whopping 844 mg potassium . Other good sources are bananas ( 451 mg each ) , raw spinach ( 839 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cup ) and cantaloupes ( 825 mg per half melon ) . Since there 's so much potassium in common foods , most doctors do n't recommend supplements . <p> ILLUSTRATION <p> Edited by Jordan Matus <p>
