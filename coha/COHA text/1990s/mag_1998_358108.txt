My wife was n't exactly surprised when I said I thought " our kids " might need a video-game deck for the holidays . Given my penchant for computer-based shoot-'em-ups , simulators and splatter games of any kind , how long would it be before I graduated to the hard stuff ? Did I say " I " ? Ha-ha . Slip of the tongue . My kids , I mean . " It 'll be educational for the girls , " I assured her . <P> I knew I was in trouble a few nights later when Ella and I were blissfully kung-fuing away in a martial-arts game . My wily six-year-old was trying to pull an unlikely Peking Pile Driver ( as if I were born yesterday ! ) , and I was this far from executing a perfect Triple-Death Windmill Kick that would have punted her out of the arena when the phone rang . " It 's someone from work for you , Dada , " she said , in that adorable , squeaky baby voice . " Hurry up so I can kick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Educational , " she said . Like it was my fault . <P> Now , my wife is no technophobe and enjoys computer entertainment as much as the next guy . Indeed , there was a time when she was so hooked on a game about piloting paper airplanes around heating vents that we all started to worry . So , naturally , I was a little defensive . " It is educational , " I rejoined , nervously surveying the games I had picked out to seed what I hoped might someday grow into an extensive video-game library : SoulBlade , Tekkan 2 , Bushido Blade and Crash Bandicoot 2 . The Sony PlayStation plays more than 300 games , which is why I bought it . And that 's just here . In Japan , PlayStation owners can choose from among 800 games . Which gave me an idea . <P> Faster than you can say Mortal Kombat 2 , I hopped over to this store downtown that feeds a growing underground market for the $65 chip that enables a U.S. PlayStation to run Japanese video games . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warranty too . But that 's where I saw my opening . I figured the unexported stuff had to be educational , if only from a cultural standpoint . I 've lived in Japan and can easily imagine the overly protective Sony-Japan marketers holding back all kinds of cool stuff , wrongly assuming that Americans just would n't understand it . Like games about sumo wrestling , which I happen to find charming . <P> " So , what kinds of educational titles do you have ? " I asked the fellow behind the counter . He scratched his chin . " What about Rocky Hopper 's Penguin Racing ? " he asked , flipping the jewel box my way . " You press the buttons . The penguins waddle . " Nah . My kids hate bird racing . What else you got ? " Well , Boxer 's Road is good , " he said . " You manage a boxer hour by hour  --  his diet , his exercise regimen . " How do you understand it ? I asked , " Do you speak Japanese ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's the educational part . You have to figure out what they 're saying . " Perfect ! A game for the whole family . <P> Read the Netly News daily on the Web at
