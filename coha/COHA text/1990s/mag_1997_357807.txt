If it were a fashion event , you might call it fabulous . Tonight 's audience at Showroom Seven , a grand wholesale-retail space in midtown Manhattan , is peppered with actors , musicians , some designers for DKNY and others at home among racks of classy outfits destined for sale at Barney 's or Bergdorf Goodman . Even the speaker looks swank , in perfectly coordinated suit and tie and black velvet yarmulke . But Rabbi Abraham Hardoon is not here to talk pret-a-porter ; he is discoursing on the ancient esoteric Jewish tradition of Kabbalah . <P> Hardoon 's topic  --  tonight and every Thursday , to packed classes  --  is how to align oneself with " the Light , " the never-ending mystical emanation of the Unknowable God , Ein Sof . That he addresses this publicly at all is remarkable , since Kabbalah was a tightly guarded secret for centuries . The extent of change in that status , however , is revealed in a boast : " Someone came to me and asked , ' Is it true that Madonna studies Kabbalah ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pause .

And Hardoon 's Kabbalah Learning Center , the controversial organization that attracts many of the stars , is just the largest and most flamboyant of hundreds of courses in Kabbalah and related Jewish mysticism in places as diverse as Sudbury , Mass. , and Boca Raton , Fla . Academic involvement in the discipline has multiplied , as have tangential pop artifacts like the best-selling Bible Code and an X-Files episode about a golem , the Jewish proto-Frankenstein monster .

Most intriguing , mysticism is increasingly viewed as the answer to what United Jewish Appeal officer Alan Bayer calls " a hungry , thirsty , **29;6018;TOOLONG need for connection with transcendent meanings " among ordinary Jews . Concludes Brandeis University professor Arthur Green , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , Western Jews tried to hide Kabbalah under the rug . Now it 's been rediscovered and reclaimed as part of the Jewish legacy . "
