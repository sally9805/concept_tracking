Are you standing in the way of your own happiness ? // Attractive . Welleducated . Financially stable . If these words describe you , the opposite sex should be beating down your door . Instead , there you are again , parked in front of the television for the third Saturday night in a row . It 's not easy being single , especially when friends , family and coworkers start questioning if you 'll ever march down the aisle . Eventually , you start questioning yourself : Will I find the right person ? Is something wrong with me ? Before answering those questions , it 's important to realize that many people are content living the single life . But if you 're not , the following five points may lend some insight as to why you ca n't seem to settle down . 1 You 're Not Ready For Commitment . If you 're a serial monogamist or juggle several relationships at once , you 're probably not prepared to commit to one person for the rest of your life . " Every single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom and stability , " says Dr. Debra George , a licensed marriage/family therapist and psychologist in Los Angeles . Finding a healthy balance between the two , she says , is a major obstacle to a successful relationship . For men , the option of remaining single indefinitely makes settling down less of a necessity . " Men are allowed to roam the earth until they are good and ready to settle down , " says Dr. George . " They 're expected to sow their wild oats until they 're 40 , and nobody blinks an eye . " A major problem here , especially on the male side , is fear of making a permanent commitment . " In the past , people worried , Am I going to settle down with the right person ? Am I doing this because of societal pressure or because of an unplanned pregnancy ? " ' says Dr. Mitchell E. Gibson , a psychiatrist in Tempe , Ariz . Men are n't the only ones afraid of commitment . Experts say , for most women , being single is a choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well . The steady increase of women in the workforce means that they no longer have to be married for economic reasons . Women now fear losing control in a relationship just as much as men . Experts say the men and women who get caught in the trap of going from one relationship to another usually have an unrealistic expectation of romance . When the " honeymoon " stage of a relationship is over , some believe that the love is gone as well . " If you only focus on romance , you neglect those other areas of love , " says Dr. George . These and other fears are partly responsible for the increasing number of couples who decide to live together without getting married . With divorce rates soaring to 50 percent , more and more single people question the need to get married when they can live together . 2 You Do n't Have A Life . Love wo n't come looking for you if you 're renting videos every night or working from dawn " til dusk . Get out there and meet people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as many different people as possible . " We need to meet 10 people in order to find one who may be an appropriate candidate , " he theorizes . " Out of those 10 , one may be your soul mate . " If you 're having trouble meeting potential dates , shake up your routine . Sign up for a class , or volunteer in your community . Find something you like to do , and you 'll increase the odds of finding someone who shares your interests . Nobody likes a workaholic . Many relationships fail when one partner is obsessed with work . If you 're constantly canceling dates due to work-related emergencies , you may be hiding other problems . 3 You 're Too Picky . Assessing what you need and want from a relationship is a good idea , but do n't go overboard . Many of us have a checklist of characteristics we look for in a partner and relationship . When an item on that list is not met , we automatically dismiss that individual as a prospect . Indeed , many modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merger . " You want your companion to be financially stable , but you do n't want him/her to care more about making money than coming over to see you , " stresses Dr. George . " A relationship is about two people caring about each other . " Photograph When you relax // If you have specific height and weight requirements , or insist that your date drive a certain car and wear certain clothes , you 've lost sight of what is tluly important . When you find someone you can call your best friend and that person is happy and productive in life , that 's all you should want . In reality , marriage counselors say , we ca n't get even=thing we need from one person . Stop looking for someone to be your " everything , " and start developing healthy relationships with all the people in your life . Keep your friends and outside interests . When a couple works together as a team instead of melting into a " we , " a good relationship is ve possible . 4 You 're Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many people let failed relationships affect their self-esteem . Do n't develop a doomsday attitude about relationships . When a relationship does n't work , it should n't detract from who you are . Women who have been burned several times in relationships may decide it 's easier to remain single . Those who have been abused or misused are likely to choose not to be involved ever again . As soon as a relationship crumbles , they blame themselves and do n't recover as fast as men do , experts say . Men have their own baggage but tend not to give up as easily . " A man has to be in a relationship with a real psycho or have been married a couple of times before he thinks about never getting involved again , " says Dr. George . Take advantage of your time alone to reflect on past relationships . Being single is a time to learn how to make healthier , happier choices . Before getting involved again , determine who you are as a person . Figure out your quirks , your likes and dislikes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationship . 5 You 're Getting Desperate . For some of us , the pressure to get married starts at age 25 . By the mid30s , people start raising their eyebrows . After 40 , people start gossiping about your inability to find someone . Experts believe the sense of urgency to get married is 10 times worse for women . That pressure makes many women choose unsuitable partners to please others . Ask yourself , " Am I just going to settle for anybody , or should I wait until there 's an appropriate person ? " It may take you a long time to find someone . By keeping the need for a mate in perspective , we give ourselves more choices . " If people learn to date smart , they 'll marry smart , " says Dr. Gibson . " Recognize when you are compatible with a person and when the potential for a healthy relationship is there . " Single people suffering from marriage anxiety tend to give off signs and signals that frighten prospective partners away . Dating is a chance to get to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audition . When you relax and take the pressure away , love will find you when you least expect it . In the meantime , concentrate on yourself . Live your life and look your best at all times .
