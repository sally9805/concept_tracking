<p> The Winter Meetings , the annual gathering of baseball 's general managers and other front-office personnel , begin Friday in Anaheim , Calif . <p> Heavy activity is expected during the five-day event , which traditionally has been major league baseball 's one-stop swap shop for teams looking to improve themselves through trades or free-agent signings . <p> One big subject of interest this year is the trade demand of Seattle 's Ken Griffey Jr. , who is coveted by nearly every team , though only a handful can afford the annual salary , potentially $ 20 million , he could command . <p> The Dodgers also are awaiting word on whether their young third baseman Adrian Beltre will be declared a free agent , an occurrence that surely would open a bidding war for his services . <p> This year 's free-agent class is not considered a bumper crop , but that only makes it more challenging for the GMs to determine which players best fit their needs . <p> USA TODAY baseball writers Mel Antonen and Chuck Johnson provide a glimpse of who 's available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holes to fill <p> * Cubs ' center field : Lance Johnson was released after the season and has n't been replaced . The Cubs have inquired about Anaheim 's Darin Erstad . <p> * Red Sox 's closer : Tom Gordon is out with an elbow injury . Where will the saves come from ? <p> * Blue Jays ' DH : Void still left by Jose Canseco 's departure after 1997 . <p> * Astros ' shortstop : With Ricky Gutierrez a free agent , Craig Biggio 's double-play mate is unknown . <p> * Twins ' power : Weakest home run-hitting team in the AL . <p> Griffey update <p> Houston , the New York teams , Cleveland and St. Louis have been mentioned in trade speculation with Seattle for center fielder Ken Griffey Jr. , but the Cincinnati Reds are the leading candidate to acquire him . <p> Why ? Simple . It has to do with hometown and family ties . And Junior is n't concerned about money . <p> Griffey grew up in Cincinnati , and his dad is a Reds coach and likely will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants to play with his new team before he decides to sign long term . <p> The Reds have made 15-20 offers . <p> If Junior goes to Cincinnati , do you think , after a half season , he will turn his back on his own father ? No way . For any other team , it 's a huge gamble to trade prospects for the hope that Griffey stays . <p> Moving on ? <p> Remember when potential free agents were traded in the final season of their contracts ? Now , teams often trade a potential free agent before he begins playing his final season . <p> It has happened four times already : Dante Bichette to the Reds , Juan Gonzalez to the Tigers , Shawn Green to the Dodgers and Alan Ashby to the Phillies . <p> Seven players who could go the same route : <p> * Carlos Delgado , Toronto Blue Jays . <p> * Alex Rodriguez , Seattle Mariners . <p> * Jim Edmonds , Anaheim Angels . <p> * Manny Ramirez , Cleveland Indians . <p> * Derek Bell , Houston Astros @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> * Eric Karros , Los Angeles Dodgers . <p> A hard sell <p> The New York Mets would like to get some value for disgruntled outfielder Bobby Bonilla , who says he 'd rather be traded than spend another year riding the bench . If he does n't get his wish , Bonilla , 36 , vows to cause some " fireworks . " <p> " Do they want to pay me another $ 6 million for 115 at-bats ? " said Bonilla , set to make $ 5.9 million in the final year of his contract . " I do n't think so . I do n't want that , either . " <p> The Mets are trying to replace first baseman John Olerud , who signed with Seattle . Apparently , Bonilla is n't being considered . <p> " I do n't think they want me playing first base , " Bonilla said . " I do n't think they want me . " <p> The Mets ' challenge is finding a team willing to give up something for a $ 6 million part-time player .

New GM Bill Stoneman may shake up roster . <p> Baltimore : Looking for a starting pitcher and a backup catcher . Otherwise , Orioles are close to set . <p> Boston : Needs starting pitching , bullpen help ( closer Tom Gordon has an elbow injury and could be out most of 2000 ) and a bat . Red Sox seem passive . <p> Chicago : Needs a lefty reliever , left-handed bat and a left side of the infield . Acquiring A-Rod only a dream . <p> Cleveland : What would an offseason be like if Indians were n't looking for starting pitching ? They might look for center fielder to replace injured Kenny Lofton . <p> Detroit : Yes , Tigers have impressive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rotation ? <p> Kansas City : Looking to rebuild the league 's worst bullpen from 1999 . <p> Minnesota : Twins need bullpen help , another starter , catcher and power-hitting bat . <p> New York : Yankees are close to being set , but then you never know . RHP Hideki Irabu on block to make room for LHP Ed Yarnall in rotation . <p> Oakland : Probably will not do much , but if the A 's do , they will snap up a relief pitcher or veteran catcher . <p> Seattle : The team to watch , considering OF Ken Griffey Jr . and SS Alex Rodriguez . The Griffey trade could happen quickly . Mariners have offers to RHP Aaron Sele , LHP Chuck Finley , LHP Graeme Lloyd , LHP Arthur Rhodes and OF Stan Javier . <p> Tampa Bay : Needs a 3B , and maybe it will be Rockies ' Vinny Castilla . RHP Rolando Arrojo is available . <p> Texas : The Rangers are focused on signing 3B Todd Zeile and one or two starters.Toronto : Sign or trade 1B Carlos Delgado . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Mets ? <p> NATIONAL LEAGUE <p> Arizona : Signed RHP Russ Springer to free-agent contract but still shopping for more relief help . <p> Atlanta : Can re-sign free-agent LF Gerald Williams , who wants $ 5 million-a-year contract , or try to find new leadoff hitter at lesser price . Interest in CF Ken Griffey Jr . has cooled because Seattle wants king 's ransom . <p> Chicago : Signing of Todd Van Poppel , a bust for four teams , is evidence of desperate need for pitching . With release of Lance Johnson , huge gap in center . <p> Cincinnati : Look for Reds to continue bid for Griffey , a Cincinnati native . Seattle wants trade to include 1B Sean Casey and 2B Pokey Reese . But GM Jim Bowden refuses to deplete team . They 've already traded for LF Dante Bichette to fill void left by free agent Greg Vaughn . <p> Colorado : New GM Dan O'Dowd addressed pitching woes by trading for promising young RHPs Manny Aybar , Jose Jimenez and reliever Rick Croushore . Still working on a trade for Ismael @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Florida : Marlins have a lot of young talent , but 1B-OF veteran with power would be good addition . <p> Houston : Main objective is keeping roster intact without hiking $ 55 million payroll . Wo n't be easy with RHP Jose Lima and OF Carl Everett due big raises . <p> Los Angeles : If 3B Adrian Beltre is declared free agent , Dodgers likely will pursue free agent Todd Zeile . Trade of moody OF Raul Mondesi for Shawn Green could improve chemistry . <p> Milwaukee : New GM Dean Taylor wants to improve pitching and catching but has limited resources to make significant trade . <p> Montreal : Needs include proven starter , leadoff hitter and middle infielder who can hit for power . <p> New York : With free-agent 1B John Olerud gone to Seattle , Mets exploring options . Toronto 's Carlos Delgado and free agent David Segui are possibilities . <p> Philadelphia : Major deals unlikely after free-agent signings of RH starter Andy Ashby and relievers Mike Jackson and Jeff Brantley . <p> Pittsburgh : Needs RH power reliever and third baseman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after dealing for RHPs Pat Hentgen and Darryl Kile , the Cardinals now want to find catcher and an outfielder . <p> San Diego : Plan is to build and develop from within , but Padres have pitchers as trade bait , just in case . <p> San Francisco : Catcher needed to share time with Doug Mirabelli . Joe Girardi is possibility . Needs 3B.
