ROBERT AND CONNIE ROBERSON FInally got their daughter Rebecca back last week . " It was great , " says Robert , a Pentecostal lay preacher , who , along with his wife , had just been cleared of 14 counts of child molestation in Wenatchee , Washington . Roberson says Rebecca , placed in foster care when her parents were arrested , " was fine  --  she just acted like she 'd been staying overnight someplace else . " <P> Many in Wenatchee no doubt wish they could resume their own lives so blithely . The Robersons were among 40 adults accused of thousands of sex crimes by detective Robert Perez . Perez 's charges were based on unvideotaped " recovered memories , " which it now seems he may have coerced from children , including his troubled foster daughter . Yet he and local prosecutors still managed to jail 28 people , many poor , mentally deficient , or otherwise unable to mount a robust defense . <P> " We were fortunate , praise the Lord , but this is not over , " says Roberson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state , seeks the release of those in prison and supports a local campaign to have the U.S. Justice Department investigate . Indeed , Attorney General Janet Reno has asked her civil rights division to review the case under laws against misusing public office to deprive citizens of their due-process rights ; a report is due after Christmas . But it is unclear whether the proofs necessary to convict Perez and others are available in Wenatchee . A state appeals court may free those who were jailed . But no court can effect the rebuilding of shattered lives and families . <P>  --  By David Van Biema . Reported by Elaine Lafferty/Los Angeles and Elaine Shannon/Washington
