" A man is not a woman .... " <p>  --  Apache saying <p> They knew I did not want to be the one to kill it . They knew how difficult it would be for me to do it , and yet I was the one they sent , persuading me as only the Gongaware Council of the First Worlds could have . " You understand it better than anyone , " Prihoda Delp , Council Chair , insisted in chambers . " So much of what the creature is , is in you as well , Rau Goni . You know this and we know this and the creature knows it too . We should never have let matters develop this far , but we did , and now you  --  more than any engineered mercenary or conscripted soldier or machine we might send  --  have the best chance to end it . " <p> They knew I could not refuse . They did not bother to offer money or starships or livable moons . These I could have refused . They offered instead a question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rau Goni ? Which is your destiny  --  to end it , or at least try  --  or , by refusing to go , to keep the Darkness alive ? <p> They knew about my family . They knew about my father , but then who did not ? They knew about me  --  even the time , long ago , when I nearly died on the planet we call The Hand . They knew about my mother 's death and my sister 's , and the day my father left our world to become what he would become . A council like the Gongaware always learns what it needs to learn to do what it must do . <p> They did not ask my brothers to go and I know why . <p> They had left the creature alone for fifty years . There in its vast ship outside the trade lanes of the First Worlds it had kept its engines still  --  communicating with no one  --  and so they had left it alone . After all , it had not been a creature at first ; it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but a man nevertheless . A man with the wealth to purchase such a ship and to outfit it , and the status to demand that he be left alone . He was , after all , Giman Goni  --  Master Mapper of Hamusek , the genius who had made Change itself possible , who had fathered , by his theoretical models and technological applications , the unique human designs of ten billion citizens on over three hundred worlds , who had become wealthy in the process , and who had , in the end , known tragedy . <p> The creature rarely stirred in the bowels of the ship and there had been times when the Council wondered if it were even alive . Yet bioscanners had showed that it was , and now those scanners , passing as close to the ship 's hull as they dared , were reporting how the creature was moving again  --  moving through the endless corridors of the ship . At this point in time , given what the creature had become , its sanity could not be trusted . I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like all humans today , I could change my body if I wished . Yet I do not . I am in the minority . Even Prihoda Delp has been Changed  --  a little taller , she confides , eyes both stronger and more compassionate than before , lungs now able to breathe successfully the atmospheres of the five worlds which she must , in her official duties , visit most frequently . <p> Perhaps I have chosen to remain the way I am because I am Hamusek , because the Hamusek way of thinking values pride , the dignity of acceptance and a willingness to work with what one has been given by birth ; without complaint  --  though that same way of thinking , I know , produced my father , his Maps , and Change itself . But it was a vision of a human community vast as a galaxy that led him to these things . This is what I tell myself . <p> I have told the Council that after I have finished  --  if I succeed  --  I wish to return to The Hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wish to live on that odd planet for a year and that I wish only to have my expenses paid for . I do not wish any legacy from him . <p> They have agreed . Sometimes I think they may even understand . " Why did he bury them there , Rau Goni ? " Prihoda Delp has asked me more than once . Why did he bury them there , she means , by the dry seas with their endless sand , on a world where the fish must glide through the air to find water , where mud and molten rock seep through the thin crust and earthquakes make new mountain ranges even in one 's lifetime . My mother had never visited that world . Why there instead of Hamusek ? <p> I am only seventy years old , while a Council member is two or three times that . I know what I wish , though I do not have the wisdom yet to know why I wish it . So I do what I do , trusting that there is wisdom . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lucky bioscan through the thinnest section of the hull  --  shows a creature with two heads , each facing the other , each with what we imagine is the ability to speak . One face is dark  --  like space itself . The other , white as a moon . The hair that grows from both skulls turns , at the waist , into scales  --  the long scales of a serpent from our oldest , deepest dreams . The blue-black hair is dark enough that we imagine it shines , as it does on so many Hamusek . The long tail , whose purpose eludes all who have studied it , is as thick around as the creature 's trunk ; and living things that can only be the creature 's children ( each no larger than my hand ) cling to its tail , their legs limp , their hairy heads buried in the pores of its chitinous hide , perhaps feeding , perhaps asleep . <p> The long , articulated fingers on the creature 's two hands end in talons made of metal  --  the same metal that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to the walls . <p> The image is grainy , but experts have studied its shadows for years . Attempts to obtain other images have failed . The creature has not ventured so near the hull again , remaining instead deep within the ship , making the ship hum in ways only a living thing could , and now , at last , starting to move again through the endless corridors . <p> No creature is simply an image . There is another light , as our father used to say . The light within  --  without which no living thing has meaning . <p> Or the darkness within , I would say to him now . <p> The image is motionless on the Council 's screen . None of the council members speak . I close my eyes and see a darkness . In the darkness I see a light moving like a moth in moonlight at Hanabata 's Pond when I was a child , my father 's voice beside me , sometimes speaking , sometimes singing , sometimes silent . The light moves fitfully through the darkness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater light , and , failing , accepts the darkness . <p> " No living thing , " my father says to me in the night  --  the northern winds quiet , his eyes on me as I stare toward the mountain ranges where even now few people live- " can look for the light forever , not find it , and not be changed , Rau . " <p> I keep my eyes closed . I see the moth begin to transform . I see its abdomen lengthen , become a tail snaking into the night  --  dark as night  --  and the head split slowly in two until the two faces turn to gaze at each other ( because , after all , there is nothing in the darkness to see except ourselves ) . <p> I open my eyes , but still see it : The moth gives birth to children who will never leave it , who will stay forever , sucking blood from its tail ... because , after all , in the darkness there is nothing for us to eat except ourselves . And my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and do not find it , it does not exist  --  or that is what we believe , and by believing it , make it so .... " <p> He had made his discoveries by then , built his " changeable maps " of human genes and found his Light . My mother and sister were still alive and yet this was how he talked to me that night , as if he knew what might happen . <p> I was thirteen . He was fifty . I did not have the words to argue with him , though I knew I should . <p> The ship the creature inhabits  --  the ship now so much a part of it  --  is a third-generation , 300-kiloton lodeship , the kind used in the era of raw-ore mining five centuries ago when such ships needed armament and the starlock system did not exist . My father bought it in " deadspace mothballs , " as they say , just outside the orbit of The Singing , fifth planet of the star called Hallock . There he kept it , orbiting the red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system . But the Council did not forget . They knew what a man like Gon  --  that brain , that vision  --  might be capable of ... especially if he were insane . They knew , too , what a ship like that would be capable of  --  if he kept it operable or somehow managed to improve it . <p> The ship is three times its original size now and no longer looks like a ship . Like its lone inhabitant , it has been changing itself , adding to its mass , reconceiving its shape  --  all at the creature 's whim , all with metal it had obtained in the first decade by purchasing other mothballed ships , and , in later years , by mining with its motile machines the thin belt of asteroids just inside Hallock 's sixth world . The purchase of dead ships was easier for it , I am sure , but the corporations and private owners , at the request of the Council , stopped selling at last , and mining one 's own metal on free territory does offer privacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I sometimes wonder , have any idea what that man has become ? <p> Two-kilometer-long alloy extrusions that make no sense to those who have studied them point toward Hallock itself , while a third extrusion , not unlike a tail , points toward the darkness of space  --  the space between stars  --  as if to say : Do not be fooled ; even a star is nothing . <p> I remember him saying more than once : <p> The things we make . Rau ... we become . <p> The ship 's engines were simple at first : Sub-lock sequential tokomaks . But they too have changed . Those hired by the Council to study the sounds at a safe distance do not understand what they hear at the heart of the ship , and even now , in Council chambers , I can hear them argue . Is the creature itself now the engine ? Is the creature 's organic heart now the heart of the ship , the rhythms we hear the rhythms any ship would make if it had such a heart ? Has the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its body and its brain ? Has he been laughing at everyone , making of himself  --  and the ship  --  but a terrible joke ? Is this the greatest art any human being has ever made ? Or is this metal-and-flesh thing he has spent half a century shaping simply what he believes he is in the eyes of God ? <p> Even the weapons are different . The standard beams that a lodeship might need in more lawless times to defend itself are gone . In their place , on the hull that is no longer a hull  --  that glitters with a moving mosaic of alloy plates not unlike scales  --  there are photon weapons that appear powerful enough to annihilate entire ships , though the energy to do it would drain even a ship like this . There are weapons that appear to be neutron-casters only  --  weapons made to kill living things without destroying precious ships and cities . There are even weapons pointed inward , at the heart of the ship itself , unmovable . " What are these for ? " the Council asks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them what I have dreamed  --  that the weapons are connected , that if one is fired , all will fire ? <p> " I do not think they are weapons , " I say at last . I do not say : " I believe they are voices waiting to scream . " I do not say : " They are a simple equation between life and death . To kill is to be killed .... " <p> Only a Hamusek  --  and one who has seen a light extinguished in the night  --  would know what I mean . <p> When he would sing to me , it would be the oldest songs on Hamusek , the ones our people brought with them to our world five hundred years ago , the ones we have sung even as we have changed to fit our world , even as we have remained the same , true to ourselves . We are , after all , tall and dark-skinned , with blue-black hair  --  descendants of the families of a small corporation called " New India " whose employees specialized in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words , scouts , trackers , surveyors , clearers , outposters , and " wilderness sensitives . " Whether we came from the dark-skinned Caucasian people of the Terran state of India or from the Asiatic " Indians " of Terra 's North America , we could not be sure . There were legends  --  the kind my father loved  --  but legends hide the truth . We could , of course  --  in the strange ways of history  --  have come from both . <p> My father knew . In the end , after the tragedy , my father 's Maps certainly showed him . But in the daily lives of Hamusek 's children , the genetic truth has never mattered . We have characteristics of both peoples . They have sensed us well . The legends live on , and we sing the songs . <p> Like all young children in the towns and cities , I had grown up hearing their melodies , their feelings , without understanding their strange words . As I got older I began to ask what the words meant , and as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Toth and Gram . Our father would sing the song first in the old language , the way he would for my mother , who loved his voice , and then he would sing it again , in words we could understand . <p> He would sing to us on the banks of Hanabata 's Pond , in the cool night , on the streets of Seventh City , in his office at the polytechnic university when we visited him . He would sing of things that did not feel like Hamusek , because indeed they had once belonged to another world . <p> The song I remember best was his favorite . He would begin by saying solemnly : " This is a song about a love that even death could not extinguish . In this song a woman 's lover drowns and comes back to her as a ghost . When she sees him , she says to him- " <p> And he would sing : <p> Assunutli bi hoddentin ashi inzayu ? Bi hoddentin ashi tahay-o ? Bi hoddentin ashi ik'a-eshkin chiaona-ay Yandustan benanoyetl chi na ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> Oh where is your soft bed of skins , my love ? Where is your soft warrior 's sheet ? And where is the fair one who watches over you As you lie in your long dreamless sleep ? <p> He would stop and say : " Her lover looks at her , as pale as death , and answers ... " And then he would sing : <p> The sea is my soft bed of skins , my love . The sand is my soft warrior 's sheet . And the long hungry worms they do feed off of me As I lie every night in the deep .... <p> He had a good , strong voice ( as our mother always said ) but he would not share it at festivals or town meetings . In this way he was not Hamusek at all : He was alone , and he chose to be . The songs , I know now , were for him  --  so that he could , perhaps , feel the feelings lost to him as he made his Maps and dreamt of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ songs were for us only as they revealed him to us . We did not sing them with him . He never taught us . <p> And even they  --  these songs  --  were not enough to put a moon in the sky for him , to save him with their light . <p> The ship that carries me to the creature is small and unassuming . I am its one inhabitant . Who I am  --  my name , my biography in a variety of languages , my body as twelve different scans have rendered it , and my own genetic Map  --  has been broadcast for thirty interdays in the direction of the creature 's ship , in the broadest arc possible , on the chance that the creature ( or its ship ) might be listening ... and that my identity might somehow matter . <p> If it hears the transmission , it does not act ; it does not fire at my craft . <p> It lets me come to it ... as a father would . <p> I do not know what atmosphere it breathes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  gasses in its blood . I carry my own  --  two days ' worth  --  in light-weight tanks on my back , praying that the creature 's ship will ask no more of me than one or two gravities and that it still breathes what I breathe . I carry two weapons of my own choice : a small , worn laser-aimed projectile-rifle of the kind every Hamusek father gives his son at thirteen , and a long blade of volcanic glass from The Hand , seventh planet of our star , a blade I made myself on that world half a century ago . The Council did not understand these choices . Why not a cyclic-grenader ? An energy suit ? An arm-launched missile ? You would have so much less to fear , would you not Rau Goni ? They meant well  --  when has the Council not meant well ?  --  but intentions are not understanding . <p> I chose my weapons to show him I understood . <p> I do not wear an armored suit of the kind soldiers wear . I do not wear an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Hamusek , patterned shirt ( in the " married tartans " of our family ) and the plain durable pants we wore to school each day and still wore when my father returned home from the university , eyes distant as we pleaded with him to tell us about his work , about the Maps what it might mean : Women who looked like cats and were ferocious . Men who looked like serpents and were kind Children who could jump across rivers with boulders in their arms ! Eyes that could see living creatures at the heart of a star ! <p> In the end he would indeed tell us  --  his three sons and his daughter on the floor before him  --  what it meant : how human beings would , with the right machines , be able to alter themselves at any point in their lives , and , as they did , know the consequences of every change they made in themselves . Would lungs that let you breathe the air of ten worlds shorten your life in the end or lengthen it ? Would growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes as pretty as the rainbow fish of Dajonica make the grain crops of Hamusek poisonous to you ? The Maps would be able to tell you . <p> " There have never been maps like these , " he would say . <p> It was like a legend  --  a Hamusek tall tale  --  and we would listen to the story with wide eyes : How simple the idea of the Maps was ... how the idea had come to him one day while he was singing  --  singing ... how he would n't have been able to make them  --  in their exquisite detail  --  without the great computers on Tar and Rasi and the Council 's vast station in orbit around the twin stars of Goatcher ... How he had spoken with those computers through satellites and relays and starlock communiques for five Hamusek years , had come to know them like friends , even felt affection for them .... Sometimes he would even dream at night of meeting them , of meeting those machines and finding human beings , not machines at all .... <p> How he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paradigm , " the " open finity "  --  for the entire Map series and had asked them to generate the first Map , using the vast genetic , environmental , and social data of their memories to give flesh to his " paradigmatic paradox . " <p> How they had done what he asked , and made the second Map , too , and the third , and how , even now , as he spoke to us that evening , they were helping him design the machines he would need to use the Maps ... to let the Changing begin at last . <p> We listened even when we did not understand , for it was a story about hope and that part was always clear . Our mother would listen , too , and in the end , to say good night , we would touch our foreheads to his , to hers  --  as sons and daughters of Hamusek always did  --  and would go to bed , happy to have had him to ourselves for a time . <p> Everything was the Light in those days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I have with me two small , convenient " devices " to detect biomass and motion-in-darkness . The Council offered and I accepted . They believe they know how difficult my journey to him will be , how fraught with danger ; they imagine a monster that wishes to consume me , and yet if that is what awaits me , it is not my father I go to meet . Or a battle between a man who has lost all sanity and his son  --  flesh against flesh , bone against bone ; but if that is the struggle to come , it is not my father I am going to meet . I take the small , convenient devices simply because they may help me find him . I may not need them . We Hamusek see well in the dark , given the long nights of our planet , our breeding for five centuries , the genetic inclinations of those humans who first came to our world . <p> I take the devices . I take , as well , a small container  --  one that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great ship leaves and I stand in the silence of the lock listening . I can not hear the little ship moving away ; I can not feel its vibrations through the throbbing of this massive ship , but I know it will station itself just beyond the range of the ship 's odd weapons and wait for a signal from me . If the signal comes , it will return to this same lock and accept one human being , Rau Goni . If , after seventy-two ship hours , the signal has not come , the little craft will report to the Council and the Council will send what armament it feels is necessary to end it . <p> I pray that I do not stumble , that I do not fall unconscious . I pray that my tanks will work . I pray that there will not be an accident to set the end in motion . <p> According to those who sent me , there are four thousand kilometers of corridors in this ship . That does not matter . Whatever direction I move , I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . A son  --  or daughter  --  of Hamusek always knows . It is in the Maps , in the genes of one " India " or another . As psychologists have shown since the Changing began , the first bonds of mother and child , or father and child , do not disappear even when the bodies Change . <p> There is , I remember , a legend on Hamusek about a father who dies and leaves his body , but calls to his seven sons until the sons , unable to bear it any longer , forsake their flesh to be with him . It was that very legend  --  told to me by my father  --  which took me to The Hand fifty years ago , to my mother 's and sister 's grave there , to death itself . <p> I have always wondered what the stories of a people  --  their legends , tall tales and songs  --  do to them . That is , what power these stories have to shape human lives by their image , and the people 's own . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The corridors are dark . I remove my tanks slowly , take a tentative breath . It is air  --  the air of Hamusek , stale but familiar , dusty yet full of trees . <p> In this darkness I become what I was as a child in the forests there , what all Hamusek are  --  in their wilderness . My nostrils flare . I smell a hundred different things . The blood in my skull roars and I hear what I would never hear were these corridors in the light blinding all other senses . <p> I sense the first child near a turn in the corridor and realize that the walls here are not metal at all , but skin  --  scales , blood , pores . Did I already know ? Did I know this even as I stepped into the ship , smelling the molecules of secretions , hearing the blood rushing , seeping , and just not wanting to believe ? As his son , I should have known , should n't I ? <p> My feet , in simple boots , whisper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crackling . I reach down to touch it and it is what I imagined : Years of scales sloughed off from the walls , years of skin , brittle and turning to dust . My feet have stirred up a cloud and my lungs hurt . I cough , cough again and walk carefully , so as not to stir up the years . <p> When I reach the sound  --  what I know must be the child  --  I hold up the motion-imager and play it across the wall . In the odd green light of the display I see the moving outline of it , head riveted to the wall , body jerking as it struggles to feed . There is an immense pore  --  a shadow on the display  --  and it is at this pore that the child suckles . The pore reeks of blood . It is blood that the child needs . <p> I understand these things , as I should . <p> As the small green image moves on the display , I hear the child 's hugeness  --  its scaled tail sliding on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , heavy jaws pulling at the leather of the great pore . <p> The tail slides across the floor toward me and I step back . When it does n't move again , I step over it , hold my breath against the dust , and hurry on . I know which corridors to take . I know where he is , because it is dark , because in the dark I am a son of Hamusek , descendent of " New Indians , " and I am his son . The smells grow worse . Excrement . Old blood flaking away , turning to dust like rusted metal in your mouth . New blood oozing from the walls like tears . <p> A child like that will never leave you , I say to him . Even death can not take such a child from you , can it , Father ? <p> Prihoda Delp and her Council were worried that I would not have enough food and water , that the ship would be too large , that I would collapse from thirst and hunger before I would find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would know where he was ? <p> I trip . I fall to my knees . I sniff , smelling dryness , skin without flesh . I move my hands blindly on the floor until I find it . I am afraid  --  my arms and legs are shaking  --  but I move my hands and find what I imagined : A bundle of dry bones . The twisted skin of a child dead for decades , injured by another perhaps , or lost between pores  --  its body mummified by an atmosphere that allows the bacteria of rot only if he wishes it ... which of course he does not . You want skin and bones to remember them by , do n't you , Father . <p> My right boot has separated a bone from its bundle . I reach down and pull . When I have freed it , I rise and take it with me , the ribbons of dry sinew and skin whispering against my skin . <p> So this is what you want  --  what you would like us all to be ? <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sheer number of children , living and dead , that fill the corridors , the ones leading to the room at the heart of the ship . I find him by his smell and his sounds  --  the shifting of flesh against a metal that barely contains him , the rasp of scales wider than my face against the alloy , the whisper of nutrients moving through kilometers of tubes from distant hydroponic tanks to the buccal orifices of his body , and the whisper of waste through other tubing . <p> He is exactly where I imagined he would be  --  in the room that houses the ship 's great brain , which is his only companion now : like a wife who will not leave him . <p> The dry , mummified bodies of his dead children ( how many generations ? ) litter the entrance . I climb over them on hands and knees , my boots tearing through the skin and scales and brittler bones , then holding . I hear him shift only meters away  --  scales against metal , talons against themselves , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceiling towers in the dark . The whole room sighs . <p> It has not left this room in years , I know . The scanners were wrong : They saw his children , his immense children , and thought they were the father . It can not leave the room . It fills it so completely that the electronic interfaces it once built between itself and the ship are embedded in its flesh now , have become its very neural wiring , the walls but another skin , the ship 's body inseparable from its own . I smell its breath , which reeks of ancient air , ancient tubing , nutrients that would kill me if I drank them , blood that has been changed by fifty years of Mapping into something no longer blood . <p> I do not use the devices . I do not need to . I see him clearly , a reptile with the jaws of a demeer , that small , snarling demon of Hamusek no longer than a man 's arm , that nightmare of children scared of the dark : Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge , a demeer-God , feeding on the Darkness . <p> Father ? ... I say . I say it silently , eyes closed , my legs deep in the bones and skin of his children . He can hear me . I can feel his thoughts pass across my own , pass again , curious : <p> Who ? <p> You know me . Father . <p> He has taken our " sensitivity "  --  our " wilderness gifts "  --  and with the Maps made of them something greater , as I knew he would . I will talk to him I told the Council . How ? they said , incredulous . He is no longer human . <p> He was the Master of Maps , I told them . I am his son . That is enough .... <p> The body shifts . The floors creak . The secretions at the pores dry for an instant . The walls sigh . <p> It has , it realizes now , wanted this moment for years , though it has not known why . It has wanted one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sons  --  to come , to see what the man has made , to behold what he believes he is and by believing , has made of himself . <p> Father ... I say . <p> It does not answer . <p> You are not , I tell him , what you imagine . I show it  --  what it imagines : <p> A spark darker than any night burning in a body so inhuman that the gods who made it weep , turn away , deny their creation . <p> A father who lets his children feed on his blood , only to consume them himself , in his hunger and hatred . <p> A reptile who imagines itself a moth , imagining a moon that just is n't there . <p> Then I show it something else . I show it : <p> Three sons and a daughter asleep on their cots in a quiet house , the four lights of their souls , their father in another room , unaware . I show the mother and the daughter dying , the two lights fading  --  while the three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again  --  in another room , larger and darker  --  unaware of these lights . I show it a man who imagines himself to be a reptile  --  to be the darkness made by the two lights that have gone out , because he has forgotten his own , and the living three .... <p> No ! the creature says and the room , the ship , the bones under me shake . I know that if I go on showing it what it must not see , it will kill me . <p> I show it a pond . I let it hear a singing  --  a father's- <p> The floor buckles , metal pops , the hideous tail moves swiftly through a cloud of bones and scales toward me- <p> Is this what you really want ? I ask it . <p> I hold up the bone I have brought so that it may see it . It sees what I see in the eye of my mind . <p> Bones explode before me in the darkness , the great tail thrashing as it tries to reach me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I cry out , dropping the bone , protecting eyes with hands as light explodes inside my skull , goes dark , black bones taking their place , pulling me toward them , toward darkness . <p> I am down on my knees ' in the bones , skin , and scales of his children . I show it a picture of the man 's daughter- <p> And the jaws  --  those two reptile yet human heads  --  scream at me . The tail rushes and I fall again among the bones , hug them to me , feel myself lifted in the air , dropped . I lie coughing in the dust , and in wetter things . <p> Tubing has pulled from the walls . The air stinks of nutrients . I hear trickling  --  down walls , across floors . I am afraid I will touch it  --  the fluid  --  that it will burn . <p> I can not breathe . I hold my sleeve to my nose and try , but I can not . <p> I take the container I have brought with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know what I have brought with me ? <p> It knows  --  because it sees what I see now  --  and before the great tail can reach me , to keep me from doing what I must do , I pour the ashes from the container into my hands , raise my hand , and blow them . <p> The ashes move as slow as a dream toward the creature  --  in the darkness here . The ashes mix with the dust . <p> I bring you your daughter and your wife . I would bring us all to you as dust if I could- <p> The jaws scream again , in harmony . The tail moves through the air- <p> Our mother and sister lay in the antiseptic plastic bubbles of their hospital room while the computers of the capitol 's Medical Center  --  linked by subspace lightcom to the great computers orbiting Tar and Rasi  --  ran the Changing machines , splicing genes with lasers , accelerating the growth of cells . It took four days , and when the asymptotic malignancies began to appear  --  when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late . The cells were cycling on . Growth without direction . <p> I did not see them , but I heard . Organs invading other organs , destroying all boundaries of function , Mapless bodies that could not be reclaimed because they were no longer human , no longer Mappable . Flesh as dark as night . Bone curling within the flesh like pale vines . Noses where there should be none . Tongues where eyes should be . Stomachs that had swallowed hearts . Intestines snaking from every orifice . <p> He had wanted to believe that we Hamusek were a perfect marriage of the genetic codons of Caucasian India and Asiatic North America . He had so loved the wilderness legends he had learned as a child and the euphony of our Dravidian names , that this is what he wanted . <p> For a year he had shown our mother and sister the faces and bodies they might have , calling them up on the screen of his university computer . He had asked them again and again : " What would you like ? That proud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your blue-black hair ? That smooth forehead , those rounded cheeks , Premila ? The epicanthic eyes of one people and the narrow waist , wide hips of the other ? Which ? " He asked them so often that in the end he convinced them that it was indeed what they wanted . To be Changed . To be the first . Because they were our women . " Because , " as he said , " it is women that men love . " <p> Our mother would say : " What would you like us to be ? " <p> And our sister would say only : " I want to look like Mother , Father . " <p> In the end he had chosen for them , without asking what we  --  his sons  --  might want . <p> In the investigation  --  which found no criminal negligence , because of course there had been none-our true history as a people appeared . In a cabinet of wood-pulp records so old that they had been forgotten , that they had been lost long before Hamusek 's capitol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were . In the extreme northeast corner of the nation of India , on the continent of Asia , on Earth , there had been a region called Arunchal Pradesh  --  in the language of its people , " the land of the rising sun . " A world of endless forests , rivers , and mountains , it had been the home of a people of Asiatic stock who believed in the power of animal souls , in nature both Dark and Light . When a neighboring nation took this land , making it Pakistani , the people of Arunchal Pradesh could not abide by it . Their land had been their " India , " and now it was not . After a decade , selling the resources of their wilderness  --  its oil , coal and water-to clandestine brokers who cared nothing for national boundaries , the people of Arunchal Pradesh had their money , their corporation , and could leave-to find their " new India . " <p> They had been the first in Hamusek , yessir , the sons and daughters of Asiatic North America , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too  --  with their legends . Later , the disaffected of a Terran India in constant turmoil had come , too , bringing their legends as well . Legend had been added to legend . At first the descendants of Arunchal Pradesh had not intermarried . As time passed , they had . <p> The genetic paradigm of Hamusek had not been a perfect marriage . It had been a Sino-Tibetan Map layered over time with the genes of two continents . It had been one face ... slowly becoming two . <p> Like him . A single creature . Each face regarding the other . <p> A people 's legends , I understand now , are the stories they tell themselves in the darkness to make sense of a universe they do not understand . These stories may be a Light- <p> But they are never the true history of their flesh and bone . <p> He buried them both on the planet we call The Hand , because that way , he knew , there would at least be bones  --  clear white relics of death , of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of them lying there in the ground for years , and by thinking , feed the darkness . <p> I knew this . I knew this when I went there and dug the bones up . <p> When I found the grave outside Clay and dug them up , I was crying , but when I burned them to ash in a kiln in the nearest village , I was not  --  for I knew it needed to be done . <p> The tail strikes the floor near me . Bones leap , striking my face , my chest . I step aside . I blow into my palm once more . The room shakes . I blow and hear a cry . <p> The sound becomes something else : Rhythmic , a breathing that can not find air , a muscle contracting in pain , a human heart on fire . <p> The tail rises again , moves , hits me  --  and  --  I die . <p> When I wake , I am not dead , but my left arm is broken , and my left leg too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am . It is the ship , and yet it is not . I hear the massive breathing , and yet the room is quiet . I hear fluid trickle down walls , yet the tail does not move . A light is growing somewhere in the room and this makes no sense . I think : Fire ? I think : Delirium ? <p> The room fades . The light grows brighter , and I know this is what the creature wants  --  hat we remember it together : <p> He is sitting on the porch at home , overlooking the pond . He is crying and I have never seen him this way . But I have been crying too . It is noon . The sun is bright . My mother and my sister have died and it is the next day . I did n't mean to , he is saying . I did n't know , Rau . I thought- <p> I am sixteen , but I know what I know now . I want to say to him : You were impatient , Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very first to give them " gifts " everyone could see  --  as if they were Maps , Father , not human beings , and you the Great Mapmaker . You were so sure . You were so certain that " North American Indian " was the genetic source , because you wanted it to be . You wanted those legends , and because you did , you did n't wait .... You wanted the universe to be what you wanted it to be , Father . <p> Impatience . I want to tell him , has never been a Hamusek trait . Nor was it one of their traits either , Father . <p> But I do not tell him these things . He is my father . I am his son . <p> I must leave , he says suddenly . <p> I do not understand , I say . I am frightened . <p> I can not live here anymore . As he says H , I know what he expects : that because I am the eldest , I will tell the others . I must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sister where they should be buried , and then ... and then I- <p> Who will we stay with , Father ? I can barely say it . My voice shakes too . <p> Your aunt and your cousins . His voice is distant , like a death . You will all beine , Rau . <p> I want to go with you , I say . Please ... <p> No , he says quietly , then , I think , he whispers : I am going where no one else can go , Rau ... <p> I think I hear him say : Stay right here , Rau ... in the light . <p> I do . I sit on the porch  --  in the midday sun-because he has told me to . I sit there long after he has left . <p> I will go with you , Father , I tell him in the darkness , in this room . I will go with you now , if you want me to . <p> He says nothing , and then he says : <p> Why ? <p> To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the porch looks up , tears covering his face like blood , fluids seeping from walls . <p> He is trying to understand . <p> You know what I mean , Father , I tell him . It is time for this to end . You 've been waiting . You 've known it would come to this . I am your son . <p> The man is shaking . The ship is shaking . I must kneel because I can not stand . One of the children moves listlessly in the bones beside me , whimpering . <p> You would do this for me ? he asks at last . The words are barely human , even skull to skull , like this . I barely recognize the voice , the face that has begun to change in the night , on this porch , by this pond . <p> Why ? the jaws ask , opening and closing . <p> To show you a Light , Father . <p> The wallskins around me drip with something that smells hideous . The children in the darkness behind me do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , little cries with vestigial throats . They want something else  --  something to fill their stomachs and end their hunger , not something like this . <p> There is no Light , the jaws say . <p> There is always , I tell it . <p> Not in Darkness . <p> There is no Darkness without Light to know it by- <p> You would die for me ? the man asks suddenly . You would  --  despite what I am , what I have done  --  die for me ? <p> Yes , Father . <p> It is the porch . The man I know as my father is singing . He is singing the entire song , the one he loved . Mother and Premila are in the house and it is the four men  --  father and three sons  --  on the porch , looking out at the woods . The father 's eyes twinkle , teasing us , as he sings the end of the song : how the woman , whose dead lover has returned to her for a night but now must go , stops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my love ? When shall I see you again ? <p> And the ghost of her dead lover answers : <p> When little fish they fly and the seas they do run dry And the hard rocks do melt in the sun . When little fish they fly and the seas they do run dry And the hard rocks do melt in the sun ... <p> He is telling me why . He is telling me at last why he buried them there  --  on the planet we call The Hand  --  with its dead seas , its flying fish , its searing stone ... so far from Hamusek , so far from home . He is telling me how songs , like legends , may make us do what we do . <p> I nod . His eyes twinkle . We get up , to go inside- <p> I get up on one leg , wondering how much blood I have lost , whether I will be able to walk . I pull up the sleeve of my broken arm . I unbutton my shirt , which is wet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neck ; I want him to see the scars , so that he will understand , if he does not already , why the Council sent me instead of my brothers . <p> There is one scar at my wrist . There is another at my throat . Both are deep and both were made with a blade of volcanic glass on a planet we call The Hand , a year after my father left . Both were made in the hope that Darkness would take me from the Light . <p> Fever , dehydration , and delirium lasted , I 'm told , a week , and when the rescue team found me in the cave overlooking the dry lava beds and endless sand . I was , in the opinion of doctors , half a day from death . I had traveled so far in my dreams , and yet had never left the cave . I had discovered  --  on my long journey  --  that Darkness is not a single color , nor the absence of light , nor a true hunger for death , but only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week later that I dug up their bones and burnt them to ash . <p> The Council knew all of this , and so I was the one they sent . <p> You understand do n't you ? it says at last . <p> Yes . I do . <p> It is a remarkable thing when a ship and its flesh-and-bone body die . The tubes stop their pulsing . The hydroponics tanks shut down , leaving nothing for the tubes to carry . The body that has been engineered for this very day  --  by its own deepest knowing , deeper than a Map , as deep as light itself  --  begins to dry out . The bones protrude from the skin . The odors change from a living death to a true death , to a darkness that calls itself by its real name , and by doing so , becomes light . Children who should never have been born  --  because they were made in the image of a lie  --  begin to scream in the thin , shrill way they know , and then begin to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all takes . You lie in your own blood , your protruding bone , seeing a porch and a man and a snarling reptile no longer than your arm . Then you are up and walking . You pass scaly children in endless corridors , you trip , you fall , they pass over you , crawling , looking for walls that can feed them one last time . They are thirsty . They are scared . They can hear their brothers and sisters dying , and you feel suddenly what it must be like for them : To be abandoned by the one you love  --  by the one who loves you . <p> The engines are dying , too . The wallskins no longer smell . The silence is broken by the twitch of a tail , a claw , a child jerking once beside you . <p> You get up again . It is difficult , but you do . You reach behind you with your good arm to find the transmitter . You push the button the Council has made large enough for you to find it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can almost see : <p> A spark heading out into the darkness ... where someone is waiting to come for you . <p>
