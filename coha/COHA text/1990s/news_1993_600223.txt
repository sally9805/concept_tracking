<p> For John Stockton , road trip No. 13 of the season for the Utah Jazz began with the same routine as the previous dozen . <p> The Dream Teamer gathered his three boys Houston , 5 ; Michael , 3 1/2 ; and David , 1 1/2 around the kitchen table in their Salt Lake City home and brought out a map . <p> He showed them where daddy was going the next five days , pointing out Minneapolis , Chicago and Milwaukee . " Every time he leaves , the kids cry , " said his wife , Nada . " And every year , it gets a little harder . " <p> Life on the road in the NBA is n't a highway paved with all glitz and glamour . It 's more like a grueling road of planes and buses , a grinding routine of basketball in hostile arenas and downtime in unfamiliar cities . Snapshots of a five-day , three-city February swing with the Jazz : On the fly <p> A dozen players , including 7-4 Mark Eaton , walk through the Salt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " JAZZ . " It never fails to turn heads . Dressed stylishly , though casually ( coach Jerry Sloan does not require coats and ties ) , the players still stick out . In : full-length , black-leather winter coats . <p> Stockton does n't own one . He tries to avoid attention . " People yelling in airports , ' There 's Karl and Mark , ' that 's kind of embarrassing , " he says . But not even his size 6-1 and Scottish driving cap fool the autograph hounds who surround the players at the gate . <p> Karl Malone , the perennial All-Star and another member of the 1992 Olympic Dream Team , attracts the most attention . Nobody needs a program to pick him out . He 's 6-9 , 256 and wearing his usual attire : flashy cowboy shirt , jeans , boots and a floor-length suede winter coat . <p> " Being recognized used to be awesome , " he says . " Now , you look for a way to hide . " But there 's no hiding here . Unlike most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Before boarding the flight for Minneapolis , Don Sparks , the Jazz 's longtime trainer and traveling secretary , hands each player an envelope containing $ 300 in cash . It 's the $ 60 per diem meal money everybody from Malone , who makes $ 3.2 million a year , to rookie John Crotty , paid the league-minimum $ 140,000 , receives on the road . Rookies to the rear <p> The Jazz fly first class as long as seats are available . If enough are n't , seating is assigned by seniority . That means the rookies , Crotty and Stephen Howard , go to coach . <p> That 's not the only dues the rookies pay . It 's their job to retrieve the team 's luggage after every flight . Howard 's rookie duties do n't end there . At the beginning of the season , Malone claimed him as " my rookie . " That means Howard carries Malone 's bags to the bus . " It 'll be my luck that they do n't keep any rookies next year , " Howard says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles this season . One perk not included : The club , not the players , gets the frequent-flier miles . <p> That 's a lot of time to fill . Some sleep . Ike Austin listened to his Walkman en route to Minneapolis . Stockton read Dean Koontz 's Dragon Tears from Minneapolis to Chicago . On a bus trip from Chicago to Milwaukee , Stockton and Larry Krystkowiak worked a crossword puzzle together . <p> A long-honored tradition on planes and buses : The coach sits in the first seat . Guiding Light <p> Watching soap operas is how Austin , and many in the league , pass endless hours in hotel after hotel . The Jazz players spend close to 100 nights a year in hotels . Among soap favorites : As The World Turns , Guiding Light and The Young and Restless . " Some of that stuff happens in the real world , " said Austin . <p> The team arrives at its first stop , the Marriott City Center in Minneapolis , late afternoon on a Sunday . No soaps today . But Austin joins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ club in the Target Center to lift weights . That 's a ritual for most of the players on non-game days . <p> Eaton , Stockton and Krystkowiak eat dinner and watch Under Siege in their hotel rooms . " Dinner , " said Eaton , a veteran of 11 years and 3,000 blocked shots , " is always a highlight . On the road , the clock moves slow . " <p> On the other non-game day on the trip , Tuesday in Chicago , Mike Brown and Austin hit the mall . " Mike 's the fashion guy , " said Austin , who bought a sweater and a couple of CDs . <p> Malone had lunch in Chicago at the hotel with two representatives of Hardee 's ; he 's putting together another off-court venture with the restaurant chain . " I 'm always thinking , " said Malone , who is into trucking , cattle ranching and acting , among other sidelights . <p> Jay Humphries took a cab to the mall , bought a pair of socks , then went to dinner alone at an Italian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " To go in , sit down and not be disturbed is great . " <p> Crotty and Krystkowiak , who along with Howard are the only single players on the team , browsed several art galleries in Chicago . <p> Later , Krystkowiak checked out a Big and Tall Store and listened to blues music at two downtown clubs . Although not a star , he does n't come and go without a commotion . Not at 6-10 . " Sometimes , you just want to be nobody . " <p> Sloan does n't impose a curfew , but nobody stays out late . " Life on the road , " said Stockton , " is really boring . " He calls his family three times a day . Layups , lay downs <p> Former Lakers coach Bill Sharman was the father of the shoot-around in the late ' 60s . Even back then , players loathed them . <p> Legend has it Wilt Chamberlain never attended them after Sharman sent a trainer to fetch Wilt out of bed for the Lakers ' first-ever shoot-around . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I 'm going over to that building once today . Does he want me now or tonight ? " <p> Shoot-arounds are light , game-day , morning workouts at which the coaches go over the night 's opponent . <p> " They 're the worst part of my life , " said Malone . But he 's there with all his teammates . <p> One purpose of the shoot-around : Get the players up and about . " You get a good meal early and it gets your day going , " said Humphries . <p> The shoot-around ends at 11 a.m. , but not for everybody . Four players who see little playing time Crotty , Howard , David Benoit and Austin stick around with the coaches to work out two-on-two . " That 's our game , " said Crotty . <p> The day the club arrived in Chicago , Crotty went to the gym alone and worked for 1 1/2 hours on ballhandling , shooting and conditioning . He also lifted weights . A Sloan rule : If you do n't play 20 minutes in a game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Back at the hotel , it 's lunch time in the hotel restaurant , and then nap time an NBA game-day rite . <p> Postgame on this trip was no more exciting . In Minneapolis , after a victory against the Minnesota Timberwolves , the Jazz returned by bus to the hotel and most disappeared to their rooms . Crotty had a beer in the hotel bar by himself . Krystkowiak joined friends in the lounge . Eaton and Stockton went out to dinner . <p> The routine changed two nights later in Chicago : The Jazz boarded a bus 30 minutes after an ugly loss to the Bulls and drove 90 minutes to Milwaukee for their next game . The ride was quiet . Nobody mentioned the game . " Once a game is over , " said Eaton , " it 's over . Good or bad . " <p> The lone bright spot of the trip : Sloan called off the next day 's shoot-around . Sign here , please <p> The bus rolled up to the Hyatt in Milwaukee at midnight . It was 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside the hotel and greeted the Jazz . They wanted autographs . A couple of players signed . Most ignored the requests and headed for their rooms . " They should be at home on a school night , " said Malone . " That 's unbelievable , " said Tyrone Corbin . But it 's also typical . <p> The Jazz , like every NBA club , are hounded by autograph-seekers at every turn . <p> In Milwaukee last year , Malone said Jazz players signed autographs as they left for a game , then watched several of the kids run to a car that drove up . An adult who had hired them got out , collected the autographed cards and put them into a briefcase . <p> " That 's why I do n't sign a lot , " said Malone . <p> Craig Papka , 16 , awaited the Jazz in a mob of a dozen kids as the team left for its game against the Bucks . Only Crotty stopped to sign his card . <p> " It makes you kinda mad . It only takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Papka said . <p> Papka shows the players a photo album of his collection in his room to persuade them he does n't sell the autographs . That works at times . It did n't on this day . Good morning <p> The Jazz end the 2-1 trip with a win against Milwaukee and a 7 a.m. wake-up call for the three-hour flight home , through Cincinnati . Awaiting them were their families , the All-Star break and seven more road trips . <p> Utah Jazz/team itinerary #13 <p> SUNDAY , FEB. 14 11 : 30 a.m. : Players/staff meet at Salt Lake City airport 12 : 09 p.m. : Depart via Delta No. 1522 3 : 30 p.m. : Arrive Minneapolis/bus to Marriott City Center <p> MONDAY , FEB. 15 10 : 45 a.m. : Bus to Target Center 11 a.m. - noon : Shoot-around 5 : 15 p.m. : Bus to Target Center 7 p.m. : Jazz vs .
