In the grillroom of Washington 's Metropolitan Club , a venerable institution once presided over by General William Tecumseh Sherman , the father of modern warfare , the diners grew silent last Wednesday when Secretary of State James Baker appeared on a television screen to declare that his talks with Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz had failed . <P> The cold hand of war was once again claiming the capital . Next day a White House security man spotted a suspicious bundle , and suddenly the iron gates clanged shut . Pennsylvania Avenue and the sidewalks in front of the mansion were swept clear of people and traffic . Police cars , lights flashing , came in coveys until the package was found to be harmless . <P> Historian William Seale wondered if this was not the first time that the city had been caught up in the drama of a " scheduled war " since 1898 . Back then , debate swirled for weeks as Washington matrons in their taffeta ruffles watched from the congressional galleries , and finally the weary William McKinley gave in to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Other students found echoes from 1860 , when the North and the South amassed troops and arsenals and the muddy streets of Washington were churned by dashing horses carrying men to desperate meetings  --  all in vain  --  to stave off the coming apocalypse that some sensed , but most did not . <P> This time there are fewer illusions and no jaunty warriors or exultant emissaries . Television has brought the world into the galleries and to the White House . The foe is half a globe away , and the destructive forces gathered in the Saudi desert bear no comparisons to the minieball and grapeshot . <P> Yet some things never change . The men who argue travel in dark limousines , not carriages , but they go over the same routes and to the same places . The agencies that must make war if it comes  --  in this age , the Pentagon , chiefly  --  are as before swept up in a riptide of dread , a mixture of the pall of death and the exhilaration of using the awesome machine they have designed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corridors filled with wary brass and eager arms merchants . <P> Gallows humor , as it has throughout our history , made its comeback . Performer Mark Russell kept his political jokes up-to-the-minute . " Bush said that with the U.N . ' s permission the sneak attack on Iraq will begin Jan. 15 . . . Jim Baker and Iraqi Foreign Minister Aziz met in Geneva . Mr. Aziz brought his family , all his belongings and his resumes . " <P> At such times in the past , the floors of the two houses of Congress have become the people 's exchange , and it was that way again last weekend for the war-powers debate . No Washington matrons showed up in taffeta , but the galleries were filled with a cross section of Americans , most young , many in uniform .
