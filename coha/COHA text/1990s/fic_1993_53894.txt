Dolly Bogs , Ballyconneely Bay , County Galway , Ireland 1903 . <p> THE SLICK GRAY STONES poked out of the cliff like the polished claws of an animal . Below , the green Atlantic swirled and sent sprays of water into the air . The water could not reach Mary Flarity , who sat in her rocky alcove pondering her double pair of socks and her dead brother 's boots . She would have examined the nits on a chicken if it would have postponed her return to the cottage where her mother waited . <p> Mary had discovered the stone crevice twelve years earlier , when she was seven . She 'd come upon it after wandering away from a game of hide-and-seek she 'd been playing with her brother . She still remembered how Sean had called to her from the rocks even higher up the hill . She had not answered , and when he 'd left to search for her , she 'd crept out of the shelter , looking again and again to make certain she was alone . She 'd not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary kept a writing tablet on the stone ledge inside her alcove . Sitting under the slate roof , protected on three sides from the wind , she 'd written about the water that swirled below and about the fishermen who 'd defied it for centuries . Sometimes , by sliding forward , she could see activity on the shore . But often the men were too far away and there was no color to catch her eye . After keeping the diary or six months , Mary 's book disappeared . Birds , Mary thought , or wind . She knew some creature or force had carried her words into the ocean ; it did not occur to her that anyone had found her hideaway . <p> Mary leaned against the far wall and stretched her legs in front of her , dismissing her feet from further inspection . She held her head in her hands and , quite suddenly , began sobbing against the sound of the surf . She felt the warm tears trickling through her fingers and her throat ached . Mary focused on the pulse in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eyes . When her throat expanded , Mary imagined it was bleeding ; when it contracted , she thought she might choke . <p> Mary 's cries became louder and louder until even the crash of surf on rock was diminished . Finally , after sustaining the full volume of her cries for five minutes , Mary stopped . As she regulated her breathing , she realized there was no real pain in her heart or chest  --  there was no feeling of desolation either . " I did n't want him anyway , " Mary said to the air . The wind pushed the words back in her face . <p> Dermott McMahon was not Mary 's idea of a perfect bridegroom . Mary had never formulated any such notion , not that it would have mattered if she had . There was only Dermort  --  and now that he 'd decided " to abide with me mother , " he was no longer a possibility . The other bachelors in Dolly Bogs were over fifty years old or had about as much business getting married as Father Cregan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a barrelful of dirt they could call their own . <p> Mary smoothed her skirt , folding her hands on top of it . Her fingers were as red as the fuchsia which grew on the cliffs . Thick dirt-colored scabs had formed in the cuts beside her fingernails . A large burn , once as purple as Lenten cloths but now the color of freckles , sat like a coin between her thumb and first finger . Her hand had been burned two years ago when she 'd reached into the fire to remove a potato . Nora , Mary 's mother , had grabbed her daughter 's . hand and spit on it . And it was while comforting Mary that Nora first mentioned Dermott McMahon . <p> " There , there , " Nora said , leading Mary to her bed beside the hearth . " I know it hurts . " Nora seemed to be transfixed by her daughter 's hands , looking first to one and then the other . Finally , she spoke again . " You 're just a girl , but already your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mother 's gray eyes . The eyelashes were pale and thin ; Mary wondered if her own would look the same in forty years . <p> " You know Andrew McMahon has died , " Nora said , taking a breath before continuing . " That will leave Dermott alone with his mother . It makes me think he 'll be looking for a wife in the next year or two , Lord willing . " <p> Nora rarely spoke of the McMahons , who lived on a large parcel of land on the other side of Clifton Stream . The McMahons were a reclusive lot . They left their grazing sheep only for Sunday Mass , and then it was usually through a blur that the other residents of Dolly Bogs saw them . Dermott had a way of whipping the donkey so it sped up just as he was passing a group of his neighbors . <p> " And what is that to me , Mother ? " Mary had asked . <p> " Look at your own hands , girl , to answer that question . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to your sons  --  fine , too , not to struggle every day of your life . Just keep your eye out for Dermott , that 's all I 'll say . Keep your eye out . I believe Dermott is a great one for noticing the girls . " <p> After Nora 's instructions Mary kept her eyes on the back of Dermott 's head each Sunday morning . Her eyes followed him as he stood , sat , and knelt  --  followed as he allowed sinful thoughts to distract him from his weekly duty . Because Dermott was a head taller than his mother , it was easy to follow where he was looking . Dermott 's eyes were always scanning the family groups in front of him . As Nora had said , Dermott 's eyes did roam . First they 'd light on Kathleen McBride in the second pew , then they 'd go to Bridget Hogan in the fifth . By the time Father Cregan got to the Lavabo , Dermott 's eyes were on Patsy O'Rourke in the seventh pew . <p> From her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dark vestibule-Mary watched as Dermott 's hair became grayer and grayer . She watched Will McMahon , Dermott 's uncle , become too crippled to kneel . In two years time , Will 's neck had become so stiff , his back so bent , that he could no longer look up ; his only view was the top of his muddy shoes on the church floor . <p> Only Agnes McMahon , Dermott 's mother , seemed to be thriving . Instead of shrinking , she grew taller . The week before Will died , the top of Mrs. McMahon 's bony skull ( which in church was always covered with a wool kerchief ) had reached to her son 's shoulder . But it was n't just height she 'd gained . Since Mary had been observing the McMahons , the old woman had become broader and stouter until she resembled one of her own hearty gray donkeys . <p> Plumpness was rare in women with grown children . " A sign of good health , " Nora said , not too happily . The other old women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were outweighed by twelve-yearold children . <p> After Will McMahon 's funeral , Nora spoke to Mary again . " Andrew and Will McMahon  --  may they rest in peace  --  were not poor men . They were able to hold their land through thick and thin . And while they had their share of rocks and boulders , they always made a good living with their sheep . I 've heard they have over a hundred head and I 've no reason to doubt it . " <p> Mary pictured the dumb animals always running and standing , running and standing . The McMahon sheep had always seemed dirtier than anyone else 's . Twigs and clumps of mud dangled from their wool so their undersides always looked as if they were filled with teats . <p> " Mary , are you listening ? " Nora asked . <p> Mary nodded , turning back to her mother . <p> " All the McMahon property went to Dermott when his father died . Now with the uncle gone to his eternal reward , Dermott will be feeling more alone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There 's only Dermott and his mother . He 'll surely be settling on a wife . " <p> " I see , " Mary said . <p> " You could be a woman with property . A landowner 's wife . " <p> The next Sunday Mary found a linen blouse on her bed . Lace as delicate as a spider 's web decorated the collar and sleeves . Mary had never seen anything so beautiful . <p> " A young lady should have something fine , " Nora said . <p> Mary had no idea where her mother had found such a luxury , let alone how she 'd obtained it . Since Sean and Dada had died , the two women had sold eggs and repaired fishing nets , but the income from that was just enough to keep them alive . Still , it seemed to Mary that Mam had a secret well where she could go for money . Half a dozen times , Mary had seen money appear overnight in the tin which Mam kept over the hearth . <p> Mary did not ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touched it lightly with her fingertips , then bent to smell its dry stiffness . When her mother was n't watching , she ran her tongue over the fabric to feel the imprint of the weave . Although she had washed the night before , she removed the large metal tub from its peg . Without being asked , Nora heated the water and when Mary sat in the tub , her mother braided her daughter 's hair . Instead of the usual braid which hung down Mary 's back and was tight enough to make her eyes water , this braid left soft mounds of hair beside her face . Nora pinned it up to expose Mary 's neck . <p> Nora brushed Mary 's skirt , then removed mud from Mary 's handme-down boots . When the two women set out for Holy Apostles Church , hardly a word had passed between them . <p> Mary could feel the wind at her neck . She pretended the sweater , which rested on her shoulders , was a shawl . Though she would want its warmth in the cold church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would drop the sweater to the floor or let it fall onto the wooden pew behind her . She squeezed her arms across her thin chest , causing her shoulders to hunch and her blouse to stand out from her body . Mary peered down at her small breasts and breathed in the odor of soap . For an instant , she had a desire to take off the blouse and to kiss her own skin . She could kiss her shoulders and her arms ; she could run her hands down the sides of her body , down her thighs and legs . It would be wonderful to twirl her feet , to massage her calves , to hook her thumbs on her prominent hip bones and strut through the fragrant field beside her . <p> Mary ended her reverie when she heard the clop of the McMahon donkey . " Stand aside , " Nora whispered , " but do n't hurry yourself . " The women stepped into the muddy rut on the left as Dermott and Agnes McMahon passed . Walking the final quarter-mile to the church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instruct her . " Stand straight , Mary , the back of a woman is a lovely thing . I 'll guarantee that today you wo n't see anyone you like better than yourself . " <p> Dermott was standing beside his donkey as they approached . His mother had gone into the church . Nora too went directly into the church , but Mary nodded toward the donkey cart and then paused for a second . Dermott followed Mary into the church . In the damp vestibule , sensing Dermott was behind her , Mary lifted a tiny lock of unruly hair from the back of her neck . With a finger she managed to poke it back into the heavy braid . A second later , she removed her sweater . Next , she lingered at the holy water font . " His eyes are on my neck , " Mary thought , as she reached down to brush a thistle off her skirt . Slowly , she walked to where her mother sat in the tenth pew . A second later Dermott entered the church to take his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dead , Mary thought of Dermott . His face was lined and the last two fingers on both hands were twisted with arthritis , but at thirty-eight he was still a young man . Nora said he 'd get even better with age . " When the gray turns to white he 'll be a fine figure of a man , " Nora had said . <p> " Thy holy apostles and martyrs , " Father Cregan prayed , " with John , Stephen , Matthias , Barnabas , Ignatius , Alexander , Marcellinus , Peter , Felicitas , Perpetua , Agatha , Lucy , Agnes , Cecilia , Anastasia , and all Thy saints ; into whose company we implore Thee to admit us , not weighing our merits , but freely granting us pardon . Through Christ our Lord . " <p> Mary knew Dermott would approach her after church let out , but she was not prepared for the directness of his question . " Would you walk with me this afternoon ? " he 'd asked . Mary had blushed deeply before agreeing . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a part of Mary 's weekly routine as Wednesday 's baking . He arrived at the house each Sunday at two . Nora greeted him , and together they stood silently on the path looking out to the sky . They exchanged a few words about the weather before Nora called to Mary , who then stepped through the threshold . <p> " You 're off then , " Nora would say , and Mary and Dermott would nod before beginning their walk . <p> Sometimes they 'd turn east to the inland road where they could hear the stones crunch under their feet . If people were out in the road they 'd have a chat . Occasionally , they 'd walk as far as the wider road which ran into a still wider road that went to Galway . Usually , though , they 'd go west to the ocean . They 'd walk through small rocky pastures and patches of gorse ; they 'd walk onto rocky ledges and hills , always keeping their eyes on the changing sky which moved from gray to purple or from blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nowhere else , " Dermott would say when Mary looked to the heavens . " That 's true , " Mary would answer , but she 'd wonder how Dermott could know such a thing . The McMahons , like the Flaritys , had never gone anywhere . <p> After they 'd been walking out for a couple of months , Dermott began talking to Mary about his farm . He 'd tell her how he was rethatching the barn or mending a wall . Often there were stories about his sheep-about cloven hooves caught in rocky vises , about lambs found dead after being born in the night . " They ca n't take the chill and I 've got to find them before they die , " Dermott said once , explaining that he did n't always know when the ewes would lamb . " I 've got to check them through the night when their time has come . " <p> Mary would listen intently , surprised by Dermott 's feeling for his animals . On the day he told her a young ewe had died while lambing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They do n't usually have twins the first time so I only expected a single . Well , the second lamb was a breech and would n't come . I reached in to twist , but it just would n't come . They both died . " <p> " The first lamb ? " Mary asked . <p> " Too weak . I could n't find another to take him . " <p> Mary had twice seen shepherds pull slippery lambs from their mother 's bodies but she could n't imagine Dermott doing this . Her face turned red when she thought of it ; quickly , she looked to the Atlantic , which was crashing noisily forty yards beneath where they sat . <p> Mary remembered the birth of Eileen O'Malley 's first baby four years ago . Old Tabbie , the midwife , was down in Limerick with a grandniece when Eileen 's time came . Mike O'Malley had come for Nora and Mary had gone too . While Nora and two other women looked between Eileen 's legs , Mary had been told to get into bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 'd said , but Mary had n't been able to pry Eileen 's hands from her own . " Do n't leave me , " Eileen screamed , holding tightly to Mary 's fingers . By the time Mary had been able to substitute an iron crucifix for her hand , Eileen was screaming in her ear . <p> " I 've got hold of you , " Mary said over and over , pressing Eileen 's shoulders . Mary had positioned herself behind Eileen with one leg on either side of her so it might have seemed that Mary herself was giving birth , only instead of a baby it was a grown woman being born  --  a grown woman screaming to the ceiling for all the saints to come and help her . When the baby , a boy , finally arrived , Mary was so stiff she could barely move from the bed . Eileen , who kept crying big gusty cries , had been cleaned and given the child . <p> Dermott 's cough brought Mary back to the oceanside , but instead of the ocean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animal . He was looking inside the ewe 's body , to the silvery red blood and the long mucus strings that appeared before the lamb showed itself . Mary shuddered . " Thank God you have other animals , " she said , just to have something to say . <p> " I have over a hundred and twenty sheep , but few as fine as that Suffolk . " <p> Mary knew her mother would be very interested in having the number of McMahon sheep . Guessing and village gossip were no match for the words of the shepherd himself . Dermott took Mary 's hand in his own . " I 've told my mother you 'd come for tea today , " he said . <p> " I thank you very kindly , " Mary said , wondering if Mrs. McMahon would be waiting by the door , ready to pounce on her when she entered . <p> Later , Mary thought she might have managed better if Agnes McMahon had pounced . Then , at least , Mary would have known to lie still in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vicious predator . As it was , Mary had to learn on her own not to enter into any argument with Agnes . She had to learn not to look directly into the old woman 's face , because such glances were considered brazen . She had to understand that , in Agnes 's words , " Those looks were the sign of brassy girls and hussies without shame . " <p> But at the moment when Dermott first extended the invitation , Mary allowed the picture of Mrs. McMahon to fade . Instead , she thought of how happy Nora would be to learn that Dermott had finally invited her to tea . She thought how exciting it would be to announce her wedding engagement to the village and , someday soon , to hear Father Cregan read the banns of marriage on three consecutive Sundays . <p> Now , sitting in her rocky alcove , Mary was able to review the many teas she 'd had with the McMahons . The review did n't take much effort because each Sunday afternoon was like the one before . Only today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had been different . <p> Each Sunday at five Dermott would lead Mary into his house . Agnes , sitting in a red velvet armchair beside the fire , would look up from her missal as if she were the most surprised woman in all of Ireland . " Why it 's you , dear heart . And I see you 've got Mary with you . " <p> Mary hugged her knees against the black ocean wind . She did not doubt that Dermott 's mother had been working against her , and that she would work against any girl who wanted to move into the McMahon house . Over the months Mary had watched the old woman protect her prerogatives . Never once , in all the Sundays Mary had been taking tea at the house , had Agnes let Mary pour from the china teapot  --  nor had she allowed Mary to pass the plates where her misshapen scones sat like rocks on a beach . " Dermott , we ca n't allow our company to serve us , " Mrs. McMahon said whenever Mary was bold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sure , it 's something you do in your own house , Mary , but here you are the guest . " <p> " True enough , " Mary thought , " and if you have your way a guest is all I 'll ever be . " <p> Instead of relaxing as time went on , Mary grew more and more anxious during the visits . On the day Mary tried to bring the conversation around to how much work there must be on such a fine large farm , Mrs. McMahon nearly spit in her cup with laughter . " Work ? " she asked . " Who better could manage this place than me and my boy ? We can hire on a man or two when it 's shearing time , but we do n't need to have them eating off our plates all the other times . No , dearie , I can assure you , extra help is not wanted . " <p> Mary looked down to the plate on which the scones rested while the words " not wanted " rang in her ears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mary had recounted the events to Nora . " She calls him boy ' and dear heart , ' " Mary said . Nora only nodded . <p> " Sure , and he 'll always be her dear boy , make no mistake . It 's Dermott you must bring round . He ca n't be dead to your charms . " <p> " He is n't , " Mary said . But she did not tell her mother how Dermott removed her hair from its braid so he could hold it to his face . She said nothing about how Dermott braided it himself , sitting at Mary 's back so Mary could n't see his face , but could only feel her long hairs catching on his callused hands  --  could only hear his breathing . <p> " This takes concentration , " Dermott said once , when Mary asked what he was thinking . " I ca n't talk while I 'm sifting through gold , now can I ? " Mary had kept her chin on her knee . She had not asked him to speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been caught in a downpour just as they began their walk . " Let 's run to my house , " Dermott said . Mary pulled her sweater over her head and ran behind him , not looking to the green-black clouds or to Dermott 's back , which was bent into the wind . She 'd kept her eyes on the muddy road and tried to place her feet where Dermott 's had been seconds before . In this way , Mary had no gauge to measure how far they 'd gone nor how much farther they had to go . When they 'd tumbled onto the McMahon porch , all mucky and dripping , Mary had been so happy for the dryness she 'd said what came into her head without thinking . <p> " Would n't it be fine , Dermott , if this were my house too and we could put our feet by the fire and pass the day without thinking of my getting back to my own house ? " she 'd asked . The moment the words were spoken Mary knew she 'd made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the granite church . Mary , beginning to understand the full extent of her blunder , might have apologized right away , but just then Dermott put his head down and began unlacing his boots . A moment later , when he unlaced Mary 's boots , her apology died on her lips . Instead , she compounded her mistake . " I mean , Dermott , " she said , " it would be good to marry now and have some wee ones before we 're old . " <p> Dermott could n't get into the parlor fast enough . " Early because of the weather , " Mary heard him say to his mother . <p> " When the rain lessens , Mary , " Mrs. McMahon said , " you should be on your way . " <p> Dermott had placed both pairs of boots side by side on the bricks in front of the hearth . Seeing them that way  --  Dermott 's large black boots and her own smaller brown ones which had once belonged to Sean-made Mary as sad as she 'd ever been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she 'd said to no one . When Mary looked up , she 'd seen Dermott and his mother in silent communion . Both had thin closed smiles on their faces . <p> A second later , Mrs. McMahon put what might well have been a curse on Mary and her family . " Mary , " she said , " I hear that Patricia Kelly from over in Leenane is going to America . She 'll be working for a fine family in New York . " <p> Mary looked at the balding head of her enemy . She was beaten and she knew it . Tears as big as Christmas currants spilled down Mary 's cheeks . " Good on her , " Mary managed to say before letting loud sobs burst forth . Her shoulders shook with the full force of her body . Saliva ran from her mouth onto her blouse , but Mary could n't stop . The crying , unlike the tears she 'd shed when Sean died , felt good . She wanted to keep them going as long and as loud as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Dermott said to his mother when Mary was quiet long enough to hear . " I 'm sure , " Mrs. McMahon replied . <p> When the storm , like Mary 's crying , died from exhaustion , Mary put on her boots . <p> " I 'll be abiding with me mother , " Dermott said , unnecessarily , at Mary 's gate . Mary let him go back to his mother before she ran to her hideaway . <p> Mary tied her damp sweater around her shoulders . Although the dark was coming fast , she was still able to pick her way along the stones . At the top of the hill she turned to look back to the water . It might have been a big hole rather than the sea . If it had n't been for the spray that blew in her face and for the loud crashing noises that deafened her ears , Mary would have thought she was at the end of the world . <p> Nora sat close to the fire . A picture of the Sacred Heart was propped on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a statue of the Blessed Mother . Nora still wore the dark blue serge dress she 'd worn to church that morning , but in place of her black oxfords , she wore a pair of green socks which had once belonged to Mary 's father , Francis . <p> " Mother , it 's over and done , " Mary said . She let the words fly out , knowing that if she reflected on them they might remain unspoken until another week had passed . Then , of course , she 'd have to explain Dermott 's absence . <p> Mary put her arms on Nora 's shoulders to prevent her mother from getting up . Next , Mary pulled the step stool from under the bed and , perching herself on the tiny wooden seat , looked up to her mother 's gray eyes . Mary told Nora everything . <p> Eventually , after shaking her head back and forth , Nora said , " He 'll never marry with his mother alive . She 'll not let another woman in the house . " <p> " Mam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Did you know I could never have him ? " <p> " Of course not , my dear , I thought Dermott was a different sort , I did n't know the old woman 's influence . " <p> " Do you think she will keep for years ? " Mary asked . She did n't know any other way of asking . <p> " Agnes McMahon is a Tooney . The Tooneys all live into their nineties . Ed Tooney lived to be one hundred and his brother Thomas lived to be one hundred and two . " <p> Mary laughed . She could see Agnes McMahon with a head as bald as one of her newly shorn sheep . She 'd be pouring her weak tea from its pink flowered pot , serving her rocklike scones to Dermott , who would be too old to braid anyone 's hair . Too old to even see it . <p> The next Sunday , at the time when Dermott ordinarily would have come to the house , Nora led Mary to the end of the lane . " Stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And look to the road . Tell me if you see anyone coming . " <p> Mary turned away from the shrine which Nora had built with her own hands after Sean had drowned . She did not turn back even though she heard her mother digging . When she was told to look , she saw Nora lifting a flat slate stone . Under the stone was a small hole . From it Nora drew out a metal chest . " Everything is here , " Nora said . " Come sit by me while I show you . " <p> " What 's this , Mother ? " <p> " That 's a ring your father 's mother never wanted me to get , but once she died your father took it from her before his sisters could get it . It 's a real ruby . And this is your baptismal certificate and Sean 's too . Here 's my wedding paper and the plenary indulgence Father Cregan got from Rome after your father died . Here , Mary , look at this . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought , more than enough for me to live on , even if I never sell another egg or darn another net . There 's enough here for you to buy a ticket to America . " <p> " No , Mother , " Mary said . <p> " Yes , you must go . There 's nothing here for you . " <p> Mary was unable to speak , but she knew she would fight her mother on this no matter what . She would not go to America and leave her life . She had no other life . " Mother , " Mary managed to say , " I ca n't leave you . " <p> " There 's nothing for you here and the sooner you realize that , the better . Listen , Mary , there may never be a time as good as this . Patricia Kelly will take you with her . She has family connections there . She can help you find work in a fine house . " <p> " Do n't make me go , " Mary said . The words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They left her hanging on her mother 's shoulders . They left her bleeding internally where no one could see . <p> Nora counted her bills , saying the numbers aloud so that Mary felt she , too , was counting . " You 'll need money for the boat and some money to pay Dennis to take you to the Kellys in Leenane . We must write Patricia tonight . " <p> " I ca n't leave . I do n't want to . " The ache in her chest had turned to pain . <p> Nora put the money in her sock . " We shall pray on the matter , " she said . The tiny box , like a coffin , was put back into the earth . The slab of stone was returned to its place ; Mary remained frozen beside the shrine while Nora walked off to the cottage . Nora 's walk was decisive-the walk of a determined woman . Mary feared that the prayers would be answered quickly . <p> Before first light Mary went to her hideaway . " Remember ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working normally . Thoughts were not coming in words and sentences but . in sharp quick flashes like the drops of saltwater which blew into her face . " Calm yourself , " she said aloud , then sat to watch the sun appear . First , it was a yellow thread on the horizon ; next , a pale pink ship . Finally , the sky became the bright rose of a new day . " Good-bye ! " Mary called before running back to the cottage and throwing herself onto her mother 's bed . She pushed her cold face against Nora 's warm neck and breathed in the smell of Nora 's harsh soap . " Main , " she said , hugging her mother 's frail body to her own wiry one . <p> " With boots on , too , " Nora said , looking down to the quilt . " Come , we 'll have a fine breakfast before Father Cregan comes to give you his blessing . " <p> The valise which had once belonged to Nora 's sister stood by the door like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hat and gloves were on its back . Mary turned her chair so she would not see them while she ate . When they were finished eating they did not put their plates in the enamel pan by the fire as they usually did , but pushed them aside as if they expected a servant to clear the table . <p> Nora took Mary 's hands in her own . " I know you will be a good girl . You will remember to say your morning and evening prayers and write to me every week . " <p> " Mam , " Mary said , bending to kiss her mother 's hands . <p> " There 's no reason to think we wo n't see each other again in five or six years . You 'll be coming back for visits . Maybe even sending for me so I can visit you in America . " <p> " It is so , " Mary said . She knew her mother would never leave the shrine down the lane or the graves in the parish churchyard . But she could save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter was true , there was money all over America . Patricia had written that the people in America had two houses , one for winter and one for summer . <p> Father Cregan came on the back of his donkey just as Mary and Nora walked to the gate to look for him . It was a cool morning ; the sky was violet and the air was misting . The tip of Mary 's nose dripped ; the tops of her ears stung . Mary looked across the fields and rock walls to the purple clouds above the water . <p> " Good morning , Father , " the women said in unison when the priest got off his donkey . But just as they were about to return to the house , Dennis could be seen coming down the lane in his cart . Mary gave a panicked look to her mother . A second later the priest spoke : " Come here , Mary . I can give you the blessing now . " <p> Mary knelt on the rocky path and bent her head . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sign of the cross which he made over Mary 's head .

Before Mary knew what was happening , the priest had put her suitcase in the cart and was leaning against the wide wooden wheel having a chat with Dennis . <p> Nora put her arm around Mary 's back so when Mary looked down to her new cloak her mother 's hand was clutching the wool . Veins like earthworms stood up from the rough skin . " Mary , " Nora said , " you 're to go off like a brave woman . " <p> Mary took her mother 's face in her hands then pulled it toward her . She kissed her mother 's lips . " We 'll see each other again before seven years have passed , " she said . <p> " I know it , " Nora replied . <p> They walked toward the waiting cart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was bouncing beside Dennis . She was turned so she could see her mother and Father Cregan standing beside the short posts on either side of the gate . They might have been decorations for all their stillness . Neither raised a hand to wave until Dennis prepared to turn onto the ocean road . Then , as if it had been rehearsed , Nora and the priest waved frantically . For an instant , Mary thought they were calling her back . Perhaps she had forgotten something , or there 'd been a sudden change in plan . But while Dennis slowed so Mary could stand beside him , her hand on his shoulder for balance , the waving continued in the exact same way . Mary waved , too . Then the cart lurched , and Dennis clucked for the donkey to pick up the pace . <p> " I wo n't see her face again in this world , " Nora said when the cart was out of sight . The boulder which held the wooden plank over the well was no match for Nora 's heart . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have sat on the lane like a beggar if the priest had n't been there . <p> " Sure , there 's lots of money in America . You and Mary will be visiting each other before long , " the priest said . <p> Nora made herself smile , but she was glad when Father Cregan decided not to join her for a cup of tea . She wanted only to sit quietly by the door and look off to the ocean . <p> <p> By KATHLEEN FORD <p>
