<p> The diners had n't dropped any bones on the floor . In fact , the floor was curiously spotless . Was I really standing in Beijing ? Could this really be the same " Peking Duck Restaurant " I remembered from 12 years before ? Staff whirled in all directions bringing me what I asked for  --  immediately . Three hostesses in red traditional Chinese dresses , slit thigh-high , stood alertly by . They wore matching red lipstick . Lipstick ! <p> Twelve years after China 's economic boom first blasted off , I had returned to the Peking Duck , one of China 's most famous , most durable restaurants , to find out how much Beijing 's restaurant scene has changed . And change it has . <p> The formal name for the restaurant is the China Beijing Qianmen Quanjude Roast Duck Restaurant . It 's only one restaurant among many in the Chinese capital specializing in the famous dish , but if you ask directory assistance in Beijing for the Peking Duck Restaurant , this is the place you 're invariably connected to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widely considered the foremost technique for making Peking duck . <p> I ate at the Peking Duck for the first time in 1985 , a few months after Deng Xiaoping announced the economic reforms that are currently transforming the country . As is the case at many up-market businesses , the dining room of the Peking Duck was segregated according to political rank , Chinese Communist Party cadres eating with the foreigners in the more genteel section of the restaurant . <p> But by Chinese standards of the time , even the area for common Chinese was snazzy . Folding screens hid the service stations at either end of the cavernous , fluorescently lit dining hall . A smart staff in slightly rumpled uniforms presided over large round tables with plastic tablecloths and table numbers perched on small stands . Beige canvas covered upright chairs . Truly , Peking Duck differed from other upscale restaurants in China only in that it lacked a fish pond in the floor . ( Seeing your fish swim in the pond shows the freshness of your ginger-steamed carp . ) <p> At Peking Duck and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Chinese felt it perfectly acceptable to toss or spit bones onto the floor . One American business executive I ate with at Deng Xiaoping 's favorite Sichuan restaurant in Beijing , called the Sichuan Restaurant , found the freedom to toss refuse intoxicating . The executive flung his bones willy-nilly over his shoulder . When I walked into restaurants in those days I reminded myself , " Do n't look down . " And since the seven-story Soviet-style Peking Duck had the capacity to serve birds to more than 2,600 people simultaneously , that was quite a large number of possible bones . <p> Restaurant patrons often dined amid the bone fragments on the tables left from the previous diner . Tablecloths , especially clean ones , were scarce . Napkins ? Diners brought their own in the form of paper tissues , the same tissues folks toted around for toilet paper . Only state markets served beer on tap  --  in plastic measuring cups , and flat , because the kegs were n't pressurized . Competing for a seat in a nation that did not queue often turned into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hungry new arrivals often stood directly behind you . Breathing down your neck , the not-yet-served waited to pounce on your vacated seat . <p> A mere six years into this second coming of the Chinese God of Wealth , the Peking Duck moved into a spiffy new pad on one of Beijing 's busy new shopping streets . I simply could n't believe the restaurant 's nifty neon facade . Was I in the right place ? <p> I asked the parking lot attendant . She wore a black uniform and stood beside a man-size cartoon duck , molded from plastic in the tradition of a Ronald McDonald or a Big Boy . I suddenly could imagine a Peking Duck franchise next door to every McDonald 's in America . <p> That fantasy may not be far off . The Peking Duck is still segregated by rank , but the management has revamped the downscale section into a full-fledged fast-food outlet . Here the masses consume their orders of the tender duck flesh sitting on yellow plastic benches at Formica tables . ( Even closer to that fantasy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s 1996 trade mission to China , the Peking Duck may even open a branch in the American capital . Talks between the Washington , D.C. , government and the Peking Duck management are said to be ongoing . ) <p> I strolled up the driveway to the upscale section . Just inside the door was a souvenir stand selling carved jade ducks , white baseball caps with yellow duck bills and rubber roast ducks ( like miniature rubber chickens ) . <p> While waiting for my table , I watched the crafting of my Peking duck-to-be through the kitchen 's glass wall . Chefs in spotless toques poured boiling water over pale ducks to shrink the pores . Elsewhere in the clean , spacious kitchen , chefs corked the duck bottoms with long wooden stoppers , filled the birds with boiling water and leave them out to dry . Across the kitchen , in the finishing touches of the arduous roasting process , a chef dangled one caramel-brown duck at a time from a long pole over open datewood flames . <p> The dining room 's back wall was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which stood two life-size mannequins in 19th-century Chinese garb . Chinese tourists seemingly could n't resist snapping their pictures with the two fellows , and the fake roast duck they carried on a platter . Perhaps my biggest surprise , though , was that the dining experience itself could have taken place almost anywhere in the world . <p> One of the three serious but efficient hostesses seated me ( service in China rarely comes with a smile ) . I was the first person to use my tablecloth . Some unseen hand had folded my cloth ( ! ) napkin decoratively . Along with a cup for tea , the table was set with chopsticks propped on a duck-shape rest and with a crudite dish that contained hoisin sauce and precision-cut scallions . The waitress immediately poured me a cup of tea and brought me a cool , clean towel to cleanse Beijing 's dust from my face . <p> All around me were Beijing 's nouveau riche . At the next table , a swank couple ordered a small banquet of dishes . Their cell phones chirped throughout the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they left , they left leftovers . Food in the new China is no longer rationed , I noted , but instead shows social status . <p> I looked over the lengthy menu , a list including non-duck dishes as well as duck liver , steamed stuffed duck buns , stuffed duck feet , seared duck hearts and what appeared to be every other part of the duck but the quack . ( The souvenir stand handled that . ) I chose a simple vegetable dish and the main event  --  half of a roast duck . <p> Lickety-split , a chef wheeled out a cart and carved up my half of a canard . He left me with a small plate of thin meat slices , carefully bordered with strips of the slaved-over crispy , lightly smoked skin , a plate of cool pancakes and half the duck head . <p> I slathered a pancake with the sweet sauce , on top of which I layered a few scallion slices and a slice of duck . Then I rolled the pancake like a miniature burrito and took a bite . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and scallion combined perfectly with the warm , crisp , smoky and fatty duck  --  strange as that may sound to a " lite " American palate . Together the effect was singular and delicious . <p> And the couple near me did not spit bones on the floor . <p> Heaven . <p> Paulette Roberts is a freelance writer who lives in Washington , D.C. <p> A PEKING DUCK BY ANY OTHER RECIPE . . . <p> Tasting real Peking duck inside Washington unfortunately is extremely unlikely . Making Peking duck at home also has little chance of producing a Peking Duck-tasting Peking duck . The reasons are many , not the least of which is that most instructions for Peking duck read like my mother 's recipe for eggnog : " First raise a Guernsey cow in a field the size of . . . . " In other words , the duck 's the key . <p> The evolution of this specialized bird began in Nanjing in the 14th century when a Chinese imperial chef first roasted a duck over charcoal . When the emperor moved the capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he carried with him the craving for roast duck . Soon the rage for the elegant creature outstripped Beijing 's local duck supply . Farmers force-fed the animals to raise them more quickly . Now these flat-backed , white-feathered , yellow-billed ducks live no more than three months before becoming dining extravaganzas . Force-feeding throughout the last 30 days of their lives results in a deep red , slightly marbled flesh . Other ducks are n't so marbled . <p> Home cooks also would need the special duck kiln . The Peking Duck uses a brick oven that is square on the outside , round on the inside . A sheet-steel trough funnels out the duck drippings . Across the kiln 's domed ceiling are steel poles on which the ducks hang during roasting . Only datewood fires the ovens ; Peking Duck gave up charcoal more than 100 years ago . <p> Many Washington restaurants serve what they call Peking duck . Be forewarned , however , that restaurants here do not smoke their ducks over wood , they actually deep-fry them ! This technique , restaurants explained , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duck that is roasted earlier in the day . Also , deep-frying speeds up the process . <p> The duck may have once quacked like a Peking duck , may have once had webbed feet like a Peking duck , but to the connoisseur , deep-frying makes calling it a Peking duck a bit of a stretch . Perhaps we should just dub the terrific ganders served at these local restaurants Washington-roast ducks and enjoy . <p> CITY LIGHTS , 1731 Connecticut Ave .
