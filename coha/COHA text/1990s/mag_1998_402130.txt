Four years after his wife 's brutal death , a rabbi is charged in her murder // On the night after Halloween 1994 , Rabbi Fred Neulander came home from a class at his Cherry Hill , N.J. , temple to fini his wife of 29 years , Carol , dead in a pool of blood on the living room floor . " I was lost , just lost , " Neulander , 57 , says of finding his wife so viciously bludgeoned that her blood spattered the walls . " It shattered my world . " As it turned out , his world would soon be shattered further . When day passed with no suspect emerging , pc lice turned their focus to Neulander . And within weeks-after revelations emerged about an unseemly secret life the rabbi had hidden from his 900-family congregation-he stepped down from the pulpit he had held for 21 years . Not long before Yom Kippur , the Jewish Day of Atonement , police arrested the rabbi and charged him with conspiring to murder his 52-year-old wife . " I ca n't describe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Rabbi Richard Address , a member of Neulander 's synagogue , says of the slaying . " It upsets the balance of the community . " Though violent crimes are rare in leafy Cherry Hill , police first assumed Carol Neulander 's murder was a robbery gone awry . She ran a successful bakery , often carrying large sums of cash , and her purse and its contents-though nothing else-were missing from the crime scene . What turned investigators ' suspicions toward her husband was a mysterious incident that had taken place shortly before her death . That evening , Carol Neulander had just returned home from her bakery and was on the phone with her daughter Rebecca when a deliveryman rang the bell . " Oh , this must be the man with the package Daddy said would be coming , " she told Rebecca . But the man asked to use the bathroom , then left , leaving an envelope that turned out to be empty . Exactly two weeks later , around 8:15 p.m. , Carol was again on the phone with Rebecca when there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the bathroom man , " she said , telling her daughter she would call right back . She never did . Rabbi Neulander , who had been at the synagogue , returned home to find the door unlocked and his wife 's lifeless body . Photograph " You would never forget her , " says son Matthew of Carol Neulander . Photograph " I had no responsibility in this , " says Fred Neulander ( at his Sept. 10 arraignment ) . // The investigation was only weeks old when Cherry Hill police , surveying the rabbi 's telephone records , noticed numerous calls to Philadelphia radio personality Elaine Soncini . After repeated questioning , she admitted that she and Neulander had been carrying on an affair for two years . Later , police identified another woman they say had an affair with Neulander . In February 1995 , he resigned from his congregation , expressing regret in a statement for " behavior that brings no honor to me . " The resignation marked the end of a lifelong dream for Neulander , who had grown up in Albany , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child of a homemaker mother and a drycleaner father who was himself descended from a long line of rabbis . In his senior year at Hartford , Conn. ' s Trinity College , where he studied religion and philosophy , he met Carol Lidz , one of four children of an affluent Long Island button manufacturer . Married in 1965 while Neulander was studying to become a rabbi in Judaism 's liberal Reform movement , the couple moved three years later to the growing Philadelphia suburb of Cherry Hill , where he found work as assistant rabbi at a large temple . The couple raised three children : Rebecca , now 28 , a hospital administrator ; Matthew , 25 , a medical student ; and Ben , 22 , who recently graduated from college . But by the mid- ' ' 70s , Neulander grew restless and started his own small congregation-M'kor Shalom , Hebrew for " source of peace " - offering a less formal style of religion . " The community needed a sense of tradition but not so intimidating that people would n't feel comfortable , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following . " He was always a leader , " says a synagogue member . " He had this awesome , quiet power . " Few congregants , however , knew how he had come to use it . When Elaine Soncini 's husband was dying of leukemia in 1992 , a friend suggested that she call Neulander . He showed up at the hospital hours before her husband 's death . Soncini , now 51 , recalls being scared and angry : " I said , " I want a message from God . " And Neulander said , Maybe I 'm the messenger . ' ' " After officiating at the funeral , Neulander repeatedly called to check on Soncini , then asked her to lunch . Just weeks after her husband 's death , she says , they began an affair . To those who knew him , Neulander hardly seemed the type . " It was a tremendous shock , " says Carol 's brother Edward Lidz . " This was a very close family . " When he would walk among the congregation during services , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compliment her . " If he was living a lie , " says one congregant , " he was certainly doing his best to hide it .

Photograph Elaine Soncini regrets her affair with Neulander. // Soncini told police she saw the rabbi almost every afternoon but that shortly before the murder she had told him she planned to break off the affair and find a man who was n't married . " Trust me , " she told police he responded . " Something will happen by the end of the year . " The rabbi 's regular racquetball partner , Myron Levin , 72 , who has a criminal record , says Neulander was more specific with him . Levin reportedly told a grand jury that just weeks before Carol 's slaying , Neulander had told him , " I wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead on the floor , " then asked if Levin could arrange to have her killed . Neulander , whose attorney denies he made such a statement or request , has repeatedly maintained he had nothing to do with the murder . " The thought of killing my wife is both inconceivable and repulsive , " he said at a 1995 press conference . Though Neulander 's presence at the temple the night of the murder gave him a solid alibi-and a November 1997 grand jury failed to indict himpolice continued to suspect he was behind his wife 's death and painstakingly pursued an investigation . Finally , on Sept. 10 , they arrested him . " The evidence is both compelling and overwhelming , " says Camden County prosecutor Lee Solomon , though he refused to be specific . " I 'm not trying to be evasive , " he says . " We are limited as to what we are permitted to say about a case pretrial . " Lawyers for Neulander hope to learn more by means of two recently filed motions-one requesting that the prosecution show probable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state will be forced to lay out its case . Neulander is free on $400,000 bail awaiting an Oct. 23 hearing on defense motions , and , according to his attorney Jeffrey Zucker , his children are standing by him . Other relatives , though , appear to be reserving judgment . " This is like a raw edge that never goes away . It demands closure , " says Ed Lidz of Neulander 's arrest . " If he 's guilty , then justice needs to be served . " Photograph " The only good thing is , he 'll get his day in court , " says a lawyer for Neulander ( last year ) . // <p>
