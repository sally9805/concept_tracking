120 Million Units Affected <p> Over the next several years , owners of auto air conditioners are going to find it much more complicated and expensive to get their a/c serviced or fixed . You might find there 's nothing you can do to maintain your system , even if your car has years of life ahead of it . <p> Although they have received relatively little notice , policies are currently in place that will make your automobile air conditioner obsolete , with no readily-available substitutes yet provided by the market . <p> The auto air conditioning industry has been developing new systems to replace the conventional ones , but none are available as replacements in cars presently on the road , and might not be widely available for several years to come . Government and industry analysts predict that many of an estimated 120 million auto air conditioners currently in use in the United States will be on their way to becoming virtually useless  --  and there is little consumers can do about it . <p> This is not the result of some massive manufacturing defect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that mandate ever-tighter restrictions on and the eventual elimination of chlorofluorocarbons ( CFCs ) , the compounds that have served , among other uses , as refrigerants in hundreds of millions of cooling systems around the world for the past 60 years . These laws have effectively made the entire class of products based on CFCs obsolete . <p> Behind these laws is concern that CFCs drift up into Earth 's upper atmosphere and  --  through complex chemical reactions  --  deplete the ozone layer , which protects against the sun 's most harmful ultraviolet radiation . Since 1974 , when this ozone-depletion theory first was postulated ( intensified more recently by the discovery of seasonal thinning of ozone over Antarctica ) , environmentalists have pushed successfully for an array of laws that would ban CFCs around the world . <p> The 1990 Clean Air Act sets forth the most recent directives concerning CFC use in the United States . Following the terms of international agreements ( under the so-called Montreal Protocol ) , the Act calls for a total phase-out of CFCs by the end of the decade . Although the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chemical industry , eager to get on with producing CFC substitutes , has voluntarily stepped up the phase-out . <p> The inevitable results of such a quick phaseout on the millions of products dependent on CFCs include three key problems : Increased costs of existing CFCs as demand for dwindling supplies increases , Lack of viable substitutes for CFC-based products , and Dangerous quick-fix remedies , marketed as short-cuts , which could destroy a/c systems and pose safety hazards to consumers . <p> Little attention has been paid to what the forced obsolescence of CFCs means for the consumer . Most media coverage of the issue , for example , has focused on the alleged detrimental effects of CFCs on the ozone layer and the necessity to get them out of use . Typically the impact of the CFC phase-out has been portrayed as a minor nuisance , worthwhile in the light of more serious issues concerning the environment . <p> " In fact , it may turn out to be easier than anyone expected , " notes a special Time magazine article . " Except for medical aerosols , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective substitutes for virtually every ozone-depleting chemical . Some cost a bit more ... but in a surprising number of cases the new processes are actually cheaper and better than the old . " <p> Despite such assurances , reports emerging from the industries responsible for developing and maintaining these new processes reveal significant problems for consumers , some involving safety . Last month , for example , CR reported possible fire hazards associated with a new refrigerant that the Environmental Protection Agency wants to put into home refrigerators ( see " Will Your Next Refrigerator Explode ? " CR , July 1992 ) . Automobile air conditioners pose a particularly wide-ranging problem  --  also with some threats to safety  --  largely because car systems account for 20% of CFC use in the United States and , compared with other appliances , require more frequent service and recharging . <p> In auto air conditioners , CFCs serve as the refrigerant known as R-12 , or Freon , which was developed by Du Pont . These are to be replaced by a new refrigerant , also made by Du Pont , known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ozone layer , but is thought to contribute to global warming . ( Because of this , some environmentalists also want to phase this substance out by the end of the decade . ) <p> The effects on autos of a CFC phase-out are already evident . Shortage in the supply of the compounds  --  due to a 40% drop in production since 1986-and excise taxes on their sales have driven up the retail price of R-12 six-fold in the past few years  --  to $5 per pound retail from 80 cents . ( Substitute refrigerants , when available , are expected to cost about $15 per pound retail . ) <p> New regulations under the Clean Air Act mandate the recycling by service stations of all CFCs used in auto air conditioners , and service stations have been purchasing CFC recycling machines and undergoing various training programs in anticipation of the new business . Do-it-yourselfers , used to spending a few bucks to recharge their a/c on their own , will have to get professional service beginning this November , when retail sales of R-12 become illegal . Imminent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ R-12 for as long as they find it , shortage is imminent . <p> By some industry estimates , shortages of R-12 are expected to begin in 1993 and become severe in 1996 . ICI Americas Inc. , a major supplier of the refrigerant , reports that " in the best-case scenario , shortages will occur in late 1996 ; in the worst-case scenario , these shortages will occur in late 1993 or early 1994 , " according to Motor Magazine , an automotive-repair industry journal . <p> Although recycling is supposed to help maintain the supply of R-12 for several years to come , a United Nations report predicts that , at full implementation , recycling will supply only 40% of the R-12 needed while R-12 vehicles are still on the road . <p> The report concludes that " refrigerant shortages will occur by the mid-1990s in developed countries which will result in equipment obsolescence or the necessity of retrofitting systems to use a non-CFC refrigerant . " <p> But R-134a , the R-12 substitute , is not compatible with existing conditioners . Car a/c systems are considered by automotive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an automobile . Simply changing the refrigerant , without using proper chemicals and procedures , can completely destroy a system . <p> Auto manufacturers have begun to introduce cars with the " ozone friendly " R-134a systems , but wo n't fully convert the new fleet over to these systems until the 1995 model year , leaving the majority of autos on the road susceptible to the CFC shortage . Because of fleet turnover , for example , the Society for Automotive Engineers ( SAE ) estimates that a special blended refrigerant will have to be developed " to retrofit 149 million R-12 vehicles and maintain their operations until the year 2005 . " Coming up with the appropriate blend or retrofit for all these cars will be difficult . <p> " So the industry is praying that the R-12 will last , and scrambling for alternatives . Some think converting older a/c systems to use R-134a is the way to go . Others are hoping to find a refrigerant blend that can be ' dropped in ' to current systems , " notes the Motor report on the problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the SAE and the Mobile Air Conditioning Society ( MACS ) , agree that the only hope for your R-12 system will be to have it retrofitted to use R-134a instead of blends . Automotive experts consider all blends currently on the market dangerous to a/c systems and agree that some retrofitting would be necessary to use one safely . However , retrofitting cars to use a blend , rather than R-134a , would force repair shops to purchase additional recycling equipment for each blend ( no recycling machine can be used for more than one type of refrigerant ) . <p> " The most elegant solution for replacing R-12 would simply be to convert the a/c system of older cars to use what will become the standard new refrigerant , R-134a , " notes the Motor report . " That way , shops would have to deal with only two refrigerants , so they 'd have to buy only two recycling machines . When a car came in for service , you 'd know what kind of refrigerant was in the system simply by looking at the valves and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use R-134a poses a host of problems , however , " the report adds . " Systems using the new refrigerant operate at higher pressures than those with R-12 . At the minimum , this means that pressure switches would have to be recalibrated . At worst , the entire a/c system would have to be replaced with components designed to operate at these higher pressures . " <p> The EPA has asked the SAE to develop an affordable retrofit design that will enable R-12 systems to run on R-134a , but to date engineers have not been able to recommend a system they think consumers will be willing to pay for . Complete replacement with an R-134a system is estimated to cost $1,000 to $2,500 , likely exceeding the value of many cars needing the systems . <p> Ward Atkinson , chairman of the SAE Interior Climate Control Standard Committee , which is charged with designing a retrofit system , says the best-case scenario will be to develop a retrofit that costs about $220 in addition to the average air conditioner repair cost of $216 , more than doubling the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type of R-134a retrofit has already been developed and shown to be effective in trials in Australia , another obstacle to its widespread use emerges : not all conventional a/c systems use the same components or can handle the same pressures , according to a MACS report . This means that some cars ' systems might not be able to tolerate the retrofit developed for R-134a , and will have to rely on the dwindling stock of CFCs . Dangerous Rogue Refrigerants <p> While the SAE is racing to solve these problems and develop an acceptable retrofit , entrepreneurs have been cashing in by introducing cans of do-it-yourself refrigerants as replacements for the cans of R-12 that will be banned . Experts say the replacements threaten to destroy thousands of air conditioners no matter what the manufacturer 's claim . <p> " The problem facing consumers and service facilities is the fact that certain chemicals and/or chemical blends are currently being offered for sale to replace CFC-12 or R-12 in existing automotive air conditioning systems . These allegedly ' drop in ' replacements for CFC-12 are being sold to both technicians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The replacement items are not compatible with current designs of CFC-12 automotive air conditioning systems and can cause system failures , higher emission rates , and in some cases can become flammable or combustible . " <p> Some stores that sell automotive supplies have been marketing cans of R-134a and R-22 refrigerant , which is used in home air conditioners , as suitable do-it-yourself replacements for R-12 . As with other drop-ins , R-22 also will destroy your car air conditioner . <p> The replacement blends that concern engineers the most contain " extremely flammable " fuel chemicals propane and isobutane . Conoco 's material safety data sheet on propane , for instance , notes that propane " vapor forms explosive mixture with air . Vapors or gases may travel considerable distances to ignition source and flash back . " <p> A BMW service bulletin states that the blends can increase the pressure in an R-12 system to the point that refrigerant leaks past 0-rings and seals and permeates hoses . Atkinson , of the SAE , fears that such leaks could enter the car and be ignited by a cigarette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as long as we 've had auto air conditioning we 've used only one refrigerant , and it was non-flammable , " Atkinson says . <p> Unlike an automobile 's fuel system , air conditioners were not designed for the safe use of flammable substances . Atkinson says if a system were designed to run on flammable chemicals it would be designed to keep the chemical from possible exposure to extreme heat and combustion . And a system designed to use a flammable chemical would likely be designed to make it impossible for the chemical to enter the passenger chamber . <p> " Some idiots are out there peddling these rogues that contain propane and isobutane and this is sick , " says Simon Oulouhojian , president of MACS . " You 're building a bomb if you put that stuff in your car . " <p> Because of these concerns , MACS , SAE , Underwriters Laboratories , and major auto manufacturers , among others , have petitioned the EPA to ban the sale of all substitute refrigerants until the SAE 's retrofit task force can develop guidelines " to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CFC-12 fleet . " ( As we go to press , the EPA has not acted . ) Automotive ' AIDS ' <p> Do n't think you are protected from the rogue refrigerants just because you do n't use them , or because you plan to purchase a new car that uses the R-134a refrigerant . <p> Experts fear that people will buy unapproved replacements and eventually go to mechanics to have their air conditioners fixed . Not knowing a substitute refrigerant has been used , mechanics will suck the refrigerant into their recycling machines , thus contaminating them . The contamination then can pass to other air conditioners serviced by the machines , damaging them before the mechanic knows what happened . Subsequently , these air conditioners could pollute other recycling machines , which will continue the cycle . <p> Because environmental laws also require R-134a to be recycled , the same can happen to your new or retrofitted system . " It 's just like AIDS for air conditioners , " says Atkinson . <p> Even careful mechanics , who ask whether an unapproved replacement has been used , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If your air conditioner has been contaminated second hand , by a recycling machine , you and your mechanic may have no way of knowing what went wrong . <p> Field-testing of refrigerants is not a viable option . Only a chemistry lab , with equipment costing more than $30,000 , can determine what type of refrigerant has been put into a system . <p> MACS and other professional associations are urging members not to service an air conditioner if they have any reason to believe it is contaminated . If your air conditioner is suspected of being contaminated , you could be in for an expensive and frustrating ordeal that will include waiting for a lab test to determine what 's in your system . <p> If test results show that something other than the appropriate R-12 or 134a is in the system , the mechanic will have to draw the refrigerant into a special container and have it removed by a hazardous waste contractor  --  an expense he will pass on to you . <p> And replacement refrigerants are n't the only contamination threat . To eliminate accidental contamination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valve of R-12 systems . But , , some bright little companies are selling adapters that allow R-134a to be put into ... an R-12 system , thereby contaminating it and any R-12 recycling equipment into which the R-134a is drawn , " notes Wade Hoyt , editor of Motor . <p> All this inconvenience for millions of consumers is made more poignant against the backdrop that  --  despite environmentalist hyperbole to the contrary  --  CFCs to date have caused little traceable damage to the ozone layer and no discernible increase in harmful radiation ( see box , pg . 12 ) . <p> And there is much more to the debate about the evidence concerning ozone depletion . Unfortunately , official policies have sought to close off the debate when it comes to CFCs . For many consumers , who have had little say in what 's desirable , these policies would appear to be the opposite of beneficial . <p> By Wayne Laugesen and Peter L. Spencer <p> <p> The authors are , respectively , managing editor and editor of CR . <p> IS IT WORTH IT ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cycle , volcanoes , the jet stream , all affect ozone levels to a much greater degree than CFCs and related chemicals , making assessments of CFCs ' role in ozone depletion unreliable . <p> " There are also huge natural fluctuations in the atmospheric ozone related to weather , " says Dr. S. Fred Singer , an atmospheric physicist with the University of Virginia and developer of the method used to measure ozone . " Now what we have to do is to see whether there is a small trend produced by human activities among these natural fluctuations . And you do n't have to be an atmospheric scientist , or even an expert in statistics , to know that it is difficult to extract reliable information about steady trends when you have large , natural fluctuations that are not very predictable . " <p> Solar sunspots , for example , show a direct relationship with long-term ozone trends . With such phenomena accounting for 3% to 4% changes in ozone levels , how can one extract a trend due to CFCs that is " only as small as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Another area of debate involves the health effects of ozone depletion . " We are told that the ozone hole is important because the ozone blanket blocks much of the ultraviolet light in sunshine , which , if it penetrates to the earth 's surface , could cause skin cancer , eye problems , and plant damage , " notes Dr. Dixie Lee Ray , former chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission . " This could be worrisome , except that actual records from a network of recording instruments set up in 1974 to measure ultraviolet light reaching the earth 's surface have shown a continuously decreasing penetration of from 0.5% to 1.1% per year . If the theories about ozone depletion were correct , ultraviolet radiation should have been increasing not decreasing .
