<p> When I was a kid , I anticipated the opening of small game season almost as much as I did Christmas . Back in the late fifties and early sixties , small game hunting meant cottontail rabbits and beautiful pheasants . The thought of a crisp autumn morning and the sound of my friend 's beagle was all the inducement I needed to leave a warm bed and head for the farmlands near our home . <p> Time has a funny way of changing things . With the destruction of habitat the pheasants are gone . Rabbits are still popular but they are hard to hunt without a dog . The wild turkey which was once scarce , is now the focus of attention for a small army of hunters . I am one of them . <p> Fall turkey hunting can be easy or hard . Talk to someone who has tagged a bird and you 'll hear there is nothing to it . Speak to a fellow who has hunted hard for most of the season without filling his tag , and you get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some respects . It used to be a person could hunt all season and possibly find a flock . Today , it seems the wild turkey is everywhere . Last fall , I did a great deal of scouting prior to the beginning of archery season for deer . On many occasions , I spotted flocks of turkeys feeding in fields of cut corn . On two occasions I had to stop the truck to allow a flock to cross the road . Turkeys , were never more plentiful in many areas of the country than they are today . <p> In spring hunting , the hunter is concerned with only three things : locating a tom , setting up on him and calling . However , fall hunting can be more challenging because it has all the elements of spring hunting , while requiring even more woodsmanship on the part of the hunter . Locating birds in the fall of the year requires the hunter use his eyes as well as his ears . in fall hunting , the hunter must contend with silent birds and thus must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elusive flock . He must know the topography of the land he is hunting , and he must be able to pinpoint the availability of the food being utilized by the turkey flock . In addition , he must be able to read sign . <p> I have a motto when archery hunting . " Find the food and you 'll find the deer . " This motto is especially true when hunting fall turkeys . Turkeys feed on a variety of grasses , seeds and berries throughout the summer and early fall . insects make up an important part of their diet during this time period as well . As fall approaches and various trees in the forest begin to release mast seed , the flocks of turkeys that were seen every evening crossing the road near the old red barn seem to disappear . In truth , the flock has changed its feeding preference <p> In the southern tier counties where I hunt , turkeys often feed in fields of cut corn . They do so with fair predictability even during the hunting season . For this reason , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fields . In these areas , turkeys utilize the mast produced by oak and beechnut trees , and seem to look at fields of cut corn as dessert that caps off the meal . <p> When looking for likely areas to hunt , it is wise to check field edges and old logging roads in the woods for turkey sign . The most obvious sign in these areas are the tracks of turkeys in muddy areas and the droppings they leave as they feed . The tracks can tell a hunter how many turkeys may be working the area , and the droppings can indicate if the flock is a mixed one or perhaps even if it is a bachelor flock of gobblers . The droppings of a male turkey are elongated with a characteristic shape at the end . A cheese doodle is about the size and shape of a gobbler 's dropping . A hen turkey will leave a smaller dropping shaped like the spiral of a soft ice cream cone . A good hunter will recognize the difference . <p> Turkeys are gregarious and habitually gather in flocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , barren hens from the preceding breeding season often join family flocks so that several hens may be traveling with a flock of juvenile birds . This arrangement can produce flocks which may number up to 50 birds . Complete segregation of the sexes is not common but the gobblers have a greater tendency to gather in single sex flocks than the hens . It is not unusual for five or six adult gobblers to remain together throughout the fall and winter . <p> If sign is encountered in the woods , it should be evaluated to establish the size of the flock and its composition . Look for scratching , feathers and droppings to tell if the flock is a mixed one made up of a hen and her brood , or if it is of a different configuration . It is important to make this determination because it can affect the way the birds are hunted once the flock is found . <p> If a hunter happens upon a flock of turkeys , it is most likely to be a flock made up of a hen or several hens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the least difficult turkeys to hunt . If the flock can be sufficiently scattered , and the hen can be run off , the hunt will not be a long one . Once a flock is scattered , the young turkey 's natural instinct is to come together to reform the flock . The greatest challenge facing the hunter is to become totally concealed near the flush site and to call with enough pleading so as to capture the interest of the scattered flock . The hunter should try to call with a sense of urgency in the call . He must convince the separated turkeys he is alone , afraid and desperate . The Kee-Kee and Kee-Kee Run calls are the ones to use in these situations . <p> The Kee-Kee Run is the call of the lost young turkey and is begun with a cluck followed by three high pitched melodic kee-kee 's . The call ends with a series of five or six yelps . If a turkey answers , keep using the Kee-Kee Run call unless the bird is reluctant to come to the calling . in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the bird 's attention . Lost or separated fall turkeys will often come into shooting range by using this series of calls . <p> Many hunters mistakenly think calling is the most important factor in fall hunting . Admittedly , a hunter ought to have some idea of the turkey vocabulary and should call with the knowledge of what the calls mean . Young turkeys separated from the main flock for some time , will come to almost any calling . In the opinion of veteran hunters , the most important factor in fall hunting is scattering a flock of birds so they fly to all points of the compass . A hunter who accidently scatters a turkey flock should pay close attention to how the birds scattered . It is important to notice if the birds all fanned out in the same general direction or if they flew in different directions . If they went in the same general direction , the break up was not a good one and the birds will regroup soon . If the main flock went one way , and several birds another , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near the break up site , a hunter should hear turkeys calling within 15 minutes or so from the time the flock was scattered . It is sometimes a wise idea to approach the calling turkeys in an effort to scatter them still further . A turkey 's instinct is to reunite at the break up spot and they will if the flush was a good one . <p> A good example of why woodsmanship is more important than calling occurred last fall when I went hunting after work . I had about two hours of daylight in which to locate and to work a bird . This would be plenty of time if my luck held . The area had been heavily hunted in the preceding week and I had hoped to encounter a lone turkey . As I made my way along an old logging road , I kept using the Kee-Kee Run call in an effort to elicit an answer . The woods were quiet and I feared I was just taking the gun for a walk . <p> As I approached a logged over area of beech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I could tell , five birds had recently passed through the area . I raked the leaves with my hand and from the freshness of the two sets of scratchings , decided the birds were nearby . By reading the sign in the leaves , and by finding a dark tipped breast feather , I figured I had a flock of gobblers to deal with . I let out a string of four or five spaced out yelps and received several loud clucks in response . The birds were below me just inside an area of hemlock trees . I clucked several more times and again I got an answering cluck slightly below and to the left of my position . The birds were still feeding and making their way through the hemlocks . I decided to risk being detected and moved up to the hill and then down to where the hemlocks broke into a clear area of beeches . I hunkered next to a big oak tree and clucked once .. My heart pounded when I got several answering clucks from the thick hemlocks . Five minutes later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gobbler with a nine and a half inch beard . <p> Those birds did not come to my calling . They were contentedly feeding and I was lucky they answered my call often enough to get an idea of where they were likely to go . I knew the area well and I got lucky , but I 'd rather be lucky than good any day . <p> Hunting late in the day is a very good trick to keep in mind when there is a lot of hunting pressure . This is especially true on public lands . During the day , small game hunters often encounter turkeys and accidently break up a flock . Even if the birds were hunted , there may be a bird or two just sitting around dying to rejoin the flock . The last several hours of daylight are often the best hours of the day to hunt fall turkeys . <p> A young turkey will do almost anything to rejoin a flock before dark . When entering the woods in late afternoon , the hunter should take a systematic route around the hunting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position to shoot before the first series of calls is made . More than one hunter has been fooled by a turkey that came running to his calls and found himself unprepared for the shot . <p> Turkeys are swift , wily and crafty but they can be fooled . They are keen eyed residents of the woods and their wariness is of the hair trigger variety . A flock of turkeys is never without a sentinel and its the rare hunter who approaches too close . The American wild turkey is a most worthy opponent . His presence alone gives us reason to be in the woods . Fall turkey hunting is an exciting and beautiful sport . Tagging a bronze monarch makes it even better . <p> By Mike Raykovicz <p> Photographs by MIKE RAYKOVICZ <p> <p> Mike Raykovicz is a guidance counselor at Owego Free Academy and a free-lance writer .
