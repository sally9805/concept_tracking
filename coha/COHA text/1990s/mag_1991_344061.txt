The crackdown was as swift and implacable as a military operation . Shortly after noon last Friday , British authorities strode into the steel-and-glass London headquarters of the Bank of Credit &; Commerce International , a notorious cash conduit for drug smugglers , arms dealers and rapacious tyrants . Seizing control of the office , the regulators told bank employees to stop working and go home . The move coincided with similar sweeps of B.C.C.I. operations in Luxembourg , the Cayman Islands , France , Spain , Canada , Switzerland , the Netherlands and the U.S. , where regulators shut the bank 's loan offices in New York City and Los Angeles . The combined actions placed more than 75% of B.C.C.I. 's $20 billion of assets in 69 countries in government hands and wrested control of the empire from the bank 's Middle Eastern ownership . <P> The wave of shutdowns marked the most drastic attack yet on a shadowy institution that investigators have called the most corrupt corporate enterprise in modern history . Those ensnared in its toils include former Defense Secretary Clark Clifford , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secretly gained control of during the 1980s . Bank regulators have been probing B.C.C.I. with increasing intensity since last year , when an audit found that more than $1 billion had vanished from its vaults and the bank pleaded guilty to laundering drug money in a case linked to former Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega . Astonished investigators have since put the amount of missing funds at $10 billion . <P> Authorities in the U.S. and Europe launched their blitz last week , after a Bank of England report uncovered " widespread fraud at the B.C.C.I. Group in a number of jurisdictions and stretching back over a period of years . " That clearly confirmed what the governments had long suspected . " It 's so bad the auditors could n't even put together a balance sheet , " said William Taylor , staff director of the U.S. Federal Reserve Board 's banking supervision and regulation division . Taylor said the Bank of England had been seeking for months to restructure B.C.C.I. " All of a sudden they realized this is n't problem lending , " he explained . " This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resounding vote of no confidence in B.C.C.I. 's owner , Sheik Zayed bin Sultan al-Nahayan , ruler of the United Arab Emirates . Zayed bailed out the bank last year by acquiring control for $1 billion from Arab partners of Agha Hasan Abedi , a visionary Pakistani financier who founded B.C.C.I. in 1972 and built it into a secretive global giant . But while Zayed put up some $200 million in recent months to help First American cope with real estate loan problems in Washington , regulators have grown increasingly dismayed by the sheik 's inability to place B.C.C.I. on a sound footing . Says a European banking expert : " Perhaps now we will see months of intolerable dithering come to an end as the Abu Dhabi government at last puts B.C.C.I. 's house in order . "
