<p> Debra Lindstrom spent years pedaling nowhere fast . Then she ditched her gym 's stationary bike for one with knobby tires , got a first taste of trail dust and has n't looked back . But the 27-year-old San Mateo account manager , who recently spent $ 700 on a mountain bike , quickly rode straight into a problem : Where 's a fun trail that wo n't send her on a short trip over the handlebars ? <p> Thanks to geography and foresight  --  and taxpayer money  --  bikers on the Peninsula can choose from a variety of challenges to match any skill level . <p> Marin gets the press as mountain biking 's birthplace . But a short drive from nearly anywhere on the Peninsula can offer a quick escape to dozens of parks and preserves , where trails lace through redwood groves , across grasslands and over oak-studded hills . <p> " There 's nothing else where you can have so much fun working out , " said Lindstrom , who canceled her $ 60 monthly gym membership to pay off her bike . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone stuck in traffic on El Camino Real or Highway 101 , endless freeways , tract homes and malls seem to smother the Peninsula in asphalt and stucco . The coastal hills can seem like a teasing illusion . <p> Dan Wolfe , a 35-year-old Millbrae computer scientist , said he was surprised to find biking spots close to work and home . <p> " What 's great about the Peninsula is that within a half-hour from almost anywhere you can be pedaling through all this nature , " Wolfe said , checking the pressure of his knobby tires before heading through the Purisima Creek Redwoods Open Space Preserve . <p> Just off busy Ralston Avenue , for example , is the gate that leads to miles of dirt at Belmont 's Water Dog Lake Park . Sweeney Ridge , where Gaspar de Portola 's expedition first glimpsed San Francisco Bay more than 200 years ago , is minutes from most of north San Mateo County . <p> Wide dirt roads in Mountain View allow beginners to get their balance , while steep , narrow trails test veterans under redwood canopies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coast , Purisima Creek is a favorite for its challenging trails , big trees and sweeping views . Nearby is El Corte de Madera Open Space Preserve , where the evening fog looks like a tidal wave as it rolls in over misty canyons . <p> As the late afternoon sun cast long shadows recently at the Monte Bello Open Space Preserve , Mark Williams , a 42-year-old engineer , talked about the allure of mountain biking . <p> " What keeps me going at work all day is knowing that I 'll be able to ride after it 's over , " he said . " When you 're riding , you do n't think about that problem at work or the traffic or even what you 're going to have for dinner . It 's a workout but it 's relaxing at the same time . " <p> Monte Bello features miles of trails as well as the 2,800-foot summit of Black Mountain , which provides the backdrop for Palo Alto , Mountain View and Los Altos . <p> Another appeal of the sport is the ability to reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> It can take three hours of hard hiking to reach a remote , old airstrip that features spectacular , 360-degree views . The trek can be done in half the time by bike  --  with a blast of a descent through redwoods awaiting the return . <p> That 's another bonus : Bouncing up and down trails is a kick , like cutting turns in snow . Mountain bikers also earn their thrills : Every grinding climb is rewarded with an exhilarating descent . <p> Peter Donohue , who works at Raychem to support his mountain biking , pedals about 100 to 150 miles a week . He often spots hawks , various reptiles , coyotes , turkeys , deer and even bobcats in the Peninsula 's wooded hills . How does he find the time ? <p> " I have no other life , " he said . " It 's that important to me . " <p> RIDING TIPS SMOOTH THE WAY FOR AN OUTDOOR ADVENTURE <p> Mountain biking offers its thrills  --  and spills . <p> Its speed , for instance , can lead to problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going or a nasty case of trail rash . <p> Other problems arise when mountain bikers interact with other lovers of the outdoors . For many hikers , horseback riders and environmentalists , mountain bikers are the enemy , and not without some justification . It can be hell on wheels when zanies in Lycra fly down slopes , kicking up rocks and sending the squirrels running for cover . <p> Trail congestion and other conflicts got bikers banned from many Marin County trails . <p> The outlook here is brighter , thanks in part to the Midpeninsula Regional Open Space District , which manages 41,000 acres from San Carlos to Los Gatos . It allows bikes on the majority of its 200 miles of trails ; the speed limit is 15 mph , helmets required . The district prints a nifty set of maps as well . <p> Mountain bikers also have their own advocacy group , Responsible Organized Mountain Pedalers . ROMP sponsors rides , fixes trails and lobbies agencies to gain greater trail access . Members try to educate bikers about the dangers , both the physical and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treating hikers like slalom poles . <p> Tim Blumenthal , executive director of the Colorado-based International Mountain Bicycling Association , said the cooperation is a model for other regions . <p> " All users have the same interests  --  saving open space and recreation , " he said . <p> Not all problems are solved . Mountain bikers want more state and county parks open . That idea does n't sit well with many other trail users , who say bikes leave ruts and ruin the wilderness experience . <p> To keep trail conflicts to a minimum  --  and reduce the pressure on agencies to limit access  --  the International Mountain Bicycling Association has drawn up guidelines : <p> * Ride only on open trails . <p> * Leave no trace . <p> * Control your bicycle . <p> * Yield to others . <p> * Never spook animals . <p> * Plan ahead : Know the route ; bring tools and water . <p> * Marshall Wilson <p> THE PENINSULA 'S PEAK TRAILS <p> . <p> 1 . Sweeney Ridge , Golden Gate National Recreation Area <p> A steep ascent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de Portola 's expedition first glimpsed San Francisco Bay more than 200 years ago .

From the south , the preserve is 2.5 miles from Kings Mountain Road . <p> . <p> 4 .

The 2,700-acre preserve features an extensive network of trails and fire roads underneath a canopy of redwoods and Douglas firs . A bonus is a unique sandstone formation , although bikes are n't allowed on the short trail leading to it . <p> Parking is available at Skegg 's Point , a vista point just south of the main trailhead , or along Skyline Boulevard . <p> . <p> 5 . Butano State Park <p> Rides in this jewel of a park south of Half Moon Bay are not technically challenging but the length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fire Road starts in rolling hills and climbs into a dense redwood forest . An old landing strip at the midway point offers spectucular views of the Pacific and surrounding hills and canyons . Riders can continue on Butano Fire Road and into Big Basin State Park or turn right on Olmo Fire Road for a rapid , exhilarating descent . If you crave uphill , take Olmo Fire Road to the landing strip . <p> Take Highway 1 to Pescadero Road . Turn right on Cloverdale Road and follow the signs . Access to Butano Fire Road is through a gate off Cloverdale Road just south of its intersection with Canyon Road . The return via Olmo Fire Road ends a short distance east of the park entrance .

Area around Page Mill Road and Skyline Boulevard <p> This area is known as the " four corners "  --  where Monte Bello , Coal Creek , Russian Ridge and Skyline Ridge preserves converge around the intersection of Skyline Boulevard and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together make it one of the largest park areas in the Bay Area that can be enjoyed by hikers , equestrians and mountain bikers . <p> For a fun ride , start at the Alpine Inn beer garden in off Alpine Road in Portola Valley .
