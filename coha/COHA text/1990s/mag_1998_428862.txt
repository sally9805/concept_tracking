Fresh from its " millennium makeover , " this intimate vacation retreat is a Caribbean never-never land that you 'll never never want to leave . <p> A high-powered business executive once arrived on the Caribbean 's very secluded Peter Island and quickly issued two orders to the resort 's check-in staff : " I want to lose ten pounds , and I want to get a tan . " Wayne Kafcsak , general manager and chief greeter , overheard the request and knew he could n't deliver . With an award-winning chef in the kitchen and a 34-member culinary crew determined to pamper the resort 's 100 guests , " I could only guarantee the tan , " says Kafcsak . <p> Half an hour by boat from the nearest " city "  --  if that 's what you call Road Town or nearby Tortola  --  Peter Island is a pristine speck of heaven that is too small to accommodate cruise ships and too remote to attract tourists bent on a party-packed weekend . A visit typically stretches over ten days and often includes nothing more stressful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Depending on the wind 's direction , your boat is likely to glide past Fallen Jerusalem , whose huge rocks are reminiscent of the tumbled-down walls of Jericho ; Norman Island , legendary model for Robert Louis Stevenson 's Treasure Island ; Jost Van Dyke , where " Main Street " is a sandy path ; Necker Island , a pricey hideaway favored by royalty and rock stars ; and Dead Chest , where Blackbeard once stranded 15 mutinous sailors with only a bottle of rum , a sword , and the motivation for a song ( " Yo , ho , ho and a bottle of rum " ) . <p> " We struggle under the name ' Virgin Islands ' because people automatically think of St. Thomas , " explains Kafcsak . But Peter Island  --  unlike St. Thomas  --  is part of the less-populated British Virgin Islands , not the teeming U.S. Virgin Islands . It is privately owned by Americans , which means that all development plans undergo double scrutiny . The government carefully monitors growth and immigration , while the island 's owners meticulously supervise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " boosted the amenities of the resort without sacrificing its privacy . With only 52 guest rooms and three villas clustered on the property 's 1,800 acres , crowded beaches and restaurants are never a problem . Nowhere will you find a parking lot , a structure rising higher than the mast of a 40-foot yacht , or more than one vacationer per ten acres . Island shopping is limited to a single , well-stocked boutique . <p> " Guests are fiercely loyal to this place , " says Kafcsak , who personally welcomes visitors within 24 hours of their arrival and has been known to volunteer his services as guide for islandhopping excursions . Vacationers come back year after year , lured by the seclusion , the friendly staff , and the opportunity to sample such delicacies as snapper filled with spinach and herbs , tuna wrapped in papaya , seafood brochette , chilled coconut soup , and mango mousse . <p> " One couple has visited 35 times , always specifying the same suite , which they refer to as ' our room , ' " says Kafcsak . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caribbean , the conveniences are all-American . A spa and air-conditioned exercise center are within steps of one of the five beaches , a fitness trail winds along the shore , and each guest suite is equipped with a CD player and a take-home disc of island music . Only after a day or two in this tropical paradise do perceptive guests detect a subtle Michigan presence . Clues include icy containers of mineral water bottled in Grand Rapids and stocked in the mini-bars , as well as complimentary packages of soap , shampoo , and conditioner supplied by Amway Corporation , also based in Michigan , and arranged on shelves in the bathrooms . Grand Rapids ? Amway ? <p> The connection between balmy Peter Island and chilly northern Michigan is real and was established two decades ago when the resort changed hands . Once the property of Norwegian millionaire Peter Smedwig , the entire island was purchased in the late 1970s by Michigan entrepreneurs Jay Van Andel and Rich DeVos , cofounders of Amway Corporation . The current owners and their families are frequent visitors , flying by private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resort 's harbor on their spacious yacht . When in residence , they occupy the very private Eagle 's Nest , a villa located on the island 's highest point . Although they are rarely seen by Peter Island guests , Amway 's owners have a positive influence on the resort 's operations  --  customer service is first-rate . <p> " We do n't say no to a guest , " says Chef Wilford ( " Willo " ) Stoutt , who sometimes staffs the omelet station at the morning buffet just to hear guests ' comments . His menus change daily , so diners always have new choices . Vegetarian entrees are mainstays , and he frequently adds to the day 's offerings as fresh seafood and produce become available . Variety is important because room rates are based on a full American meal plan ( all breakfasts , lunches , and dinners are included ) . Guests can dine at Tradewinds , the resort 's main restaurant overlooking Sir Francis Drake Channel , or at the more casual Deadman 's Beach Bar and Grill , located close to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Our clientele is easy to please , " he says , " because we give them what they want . " <p> Chef Willo is one of a handful of resort employees who actually live on Peter Island . After the last launch departs for Tortola at 11 each night , resort guests have the island to themselves . Not until the breads-and-pastry staff arrives aboard the 5:30 a.m. boat does the island 's population swell slightly . This serenity appeals to vacationers who are serious about their need to " get away from it all " and to veterans of Caribbean cruises who have " done " the islands endless times . Activity options exist , of course , and vacationers can pick and choose their pastimes . A boat makes the 65-minute trip to St. Thomas weekly ( twice a week during high season ) , and the Tortola-to-Peter Island water taxi crisscrosses the channel several times a day . Thursday excursions take snorkelers to the Baths  --  huge granite boulders  --  on Virgin Gorda , and special packages combine five nights on Peter Island with two nights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibilities , perhaps the best activity available is also the simplest : walking . The views are spectacular , and because private cars are not allowed on Peter Island , the narrow paths belong to strolling and jogging pedestrians . The best time to explore the property is early in the morning after a stop at the Library , the freestanding building with louvered doors that open to the beach on one side , the pool on the other . Here you can sip juice , sample a muffin , and ( if you have n't weaned yourself from the news back home ) catch one of the morning shows on the island 's only public television . Better yet , you can claim a lounge chair , contemplate your day 's agenda , and then celebrate the fact that you really do n't have one . <p> If you go : Fly to St. Thomas ( American Airlines , Delta ) or Tortola ( American Eagle ) and travel to Peter Island by boat or helicopter . Resort rates vary according to the season and the choice of rooms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resort 's Website at www.peterisland.com . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Edged by the expanses of the Atlantic Caribbean . Sir Francis Drake Channel , and six breathtaking bays , Peter Island lies four miles south of Tortola and is the fifth largest of 60 islands , cays , and reefs that comprise the British Virgin Islands . <p> The best time for tennis ' is early in the morning  --  or under the lights at night . Water sports such as snorkeling , sailboarding , and scuba diving are cool choices for the day 's sunniest hours . The perfect way to wind clown from all sports ' activity : a visit to the fitness center , with its full spa services . <p> Where pirates once plundered , the resort 's peaked cottages and private villas frame the shore and form an open-air sanctuary surrounded by sprawling lawns , night-blooming jasmine , and hibiscus . <p> BY HOLLY G.
