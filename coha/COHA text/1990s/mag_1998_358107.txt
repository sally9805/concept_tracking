What Mike Espy , the former cabinet secretary , did is just awful , members of Congress will be the first to tell you . But what gets a Cabinet officer like Espy indicted ( about $35,000 worth of tickets and favors from the likes of chicken czar Don Tyson ) turns out to be perfectly legal for the lawmakers clamoring for his head . So many members find their way to the Super Bowl each year that they almost have a quorum in the stadium . Last month , Speaker Newt Gingrich flew to London first class with his wife ( $20,268 ) , staying at Claridge 's ( $12,225 ) and eating well ( close to $700 ) . Atlantic Richfield  --  the oil company with dreams of drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge  --  paid for everything . " Every American , " Gingrich said , " should make this trip . " <P> Indeed . But most of us are about $33,000 short . <P> In 1995 Congress tightened up on most giftgiving . But the legislators left a loophole you could fly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for trips connected with " official " duties . And so many official duties need doing in places we all want to be in . And , ooh , the facts that need finding . An electric-power association believed the best way to inform members of Congress about utility rates was to send a dozen of them , with staff , floating through the Grand Canyon , according to the Salt Lake Tribune . Utah Senator Bob Bennett and his staff logged $39,684 in paid travel including a trip for him and his wife to study international trade at Elbow Beach , Bermuda , for $3,938 . <P> Last February , Congress Watch documented a typical outing . The Tobacco Institute flew 11 members , including Republican House leaders Tom DeLay and John Boehner , to the Phoenician , a Scottsdale , Arizona resort , for a " legislative conference , " complete with morning seminars on the harmlessness of nicotine and afternoons free for golf and spa treatments at the Centre for Well-Being , at a cost of $62,890 . There 's no linkage , of course , but five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break for tobacco into the budget bill . ( By contrast , Espy 's Agriculture Department actually tightened poultry regulation . ) <P> Gannett News found that five months after the Sugar Cane League took 37 congressional staff members to Florida , Congress voted to maintain sugar price supports . And now that 60 legislators and staff members have gone to the Northern Mariana Islands , known for cheap immigrant labor for the garment industry as well as white sandy beaches , we have n't heard much lately about applying labor laws to any sweatshops that this U.S. commonwealth might harbor . <P> Lawmakers were treated to $4.6 million worth of goodies in 1996 , according to an Associated Press survey . But there must be a twinge of guilt , even among the bitterly partisan , as they sight-see in London or scuba dive in the Pacific or tee up next to someone who wants their vote . Espy , who may have learned about ethics when he was in Congress , readies for a trial that could send him to jail . <P> " Fore ! "   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
