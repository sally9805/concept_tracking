In junior high school I knew a girl who , upon drinking her first pint of Southern Comfort , pressed her fingers to her pursed lips , applied them to her cheeks , and : I Love ( kiss , kiss ) Myself , she recited , I Love ( kiss , kiss ) Myself . Nowadays you do n't have to get drunk to do that . If you 're good enough at it  --  good ( for example ) as Gloria Steinem , or Marianne Course-in-Miracles Williamson  --  you stand to make a fortune ( ask Oprah ) . If you 're terribly , terribly sincere and muzzily user-friendly , and have intellectual pretensions and the gift of over-simplified gab , you get to go on PBS with your message of Self-and Universal Love , joining the ranks of Loving Leo Buscaglia , Sam-the-Man Keen , and dreadful John Bradshaw , tutor to those poor deprived stars ( Barbra Streisand , for example ) who need to talk to and ( kiss , kiss ) love their neglected Inner Child , also their Inner Toddler . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to perform like one . It helps if you are anti- " Eurocentric . " It is absolutely crucial that you be able to tell your audience ( in all humility , of course , and extremely moistly ) what and how to think , which is to say , feel ; you got ta make them smile through their tears . And if you do  --  always provided that you eschew " elitism " and forbear making distinctions or ( God forbid ! ) judgments  --  you might even get to talk to the Muppets ! Imagine ! The bliss of pitching speech and making nice to inanimate fuzzy things ! The Frugal Gourmet gets to talk to Muppets on Public Television . I do n't think Julia Child did . Julia cooked . Julia ate . Julia felt no obligation to fill our minds with pure and lofty thoughts while we were filling our stomachs with sauce veloute . Julia , bless her soul , was old-fashioned .

The stakes are higher , now , than money : vast amounts of self-love , other people ( also regional ethnic specialties ) . Our gurus tell us that consumption is a useful social as well as personal occupation  --  righteous , in a word . You might think it takes a genius to drape the rags of piety over conspicuous consumption . It does n't . It takes the Frugal Gourmet . To be frugal , he is fond of declaiming , is not necessarily to be " " cheap . " It means that you use everything and are careful with your time as well as with your food products " ... an unexceptional culinary goal , except that he cooks so many dishes on any one frenetic TV show  --  more loaves of bread than you might reasonably expect to have time to prepare in a month , pasta enough to have fed the entire Italian resistance , if somewhat incoherently  --  you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see him to believe him . So many do . His program is the highest-rated cooking show ever . He electronically enters approximately 15 million households  --  that 's more people than , if things keep on as they are , will vote in this year 's presidential election . His five companion cookbooks enjoyed first printings of 300,000 copies or more . He was the first cook ever to have two cookbooks on the New York Times bestseller list at the same time . ( Oh , dear Julia ! ) His name is Jeff Smith ( he refers to himself , with a fair dollop of amour-propre , as " the Frug " ) . A Methodist minister whose ministry and bully pulpit is the kitchen range , " If you have not caught on to the fact ... that I am trying to pump a little theology into you , I 've blown it , " he says . Well , lo ! ( as God might say ) and behold : I 've caught on . How could I not ?

A toothy grin . Hard eyes behind thick glasses . He twitches his eyebrows at lobsters , slaps and tickles tongues ( not his own , which would be a mercy ) , caresses lamb livers , fondles kidneys ; he addresses internal organs with the anthropomorphic infatuation of a Jeffrey Dahmer .

Everyone ( I am sometimes taken aback to discover ) , no matter how aberrational his thinking processes , has a history ; and this is the Frug 's : He graduated from the University of Puget Sound with a bachelor 's degree in philosophy and sociology in 1962 , and then , in 1965 , from the Drew Theological School in Madison , New Jersey , which ordained him a minister of the United Methodist Church . He was chaplain to the University of Puget Sound for seven years ; he had an epiphany : " If we do not understand our ancestral table , I doubt that we can understand our history . If we do not understand our history , it is doubtful that we can understand our future . " He taught his students to " eat history and memories . " He opened a catering service , a cooking school , a restaurant , and a store called the Chaplain 's Pantry , which led , in 1973 , to a cooking show on Tacoma 's public television station . In 1983 WTTW in Chicago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortune Mr. Smith gives credit to onetime Windy Citizen Phil Donahue ( " I adore him . I just adore him " ) . And to whom , on national television , he confided , in 1982 , that he 'd had open-heart surgery  --  " I have an artificial valve that is going clickety-clack . It 's a marvelous thing . " In 1989 , he confided to Mr. Donahue and his television audience , he 'd had " a minor stroke , " owing to the fact that " the Holy Spirit 's a practical joker . " ( And remember : " Do n't measure . There is no need for it . " ) He loves factoids , which he conveys to his viewers with the kind of mock anger that is always a mask for real anger . His voice squeaking and escalating into thin exasperation and gratuitous contention , his reprimands are a failed attempt at folksiness . " Do n't go squawking at me ....

" ) The Frug 's fans are not purchasing recipes , they are buying comfy-cozy liberal pieties and beatitudes . He 's a downscale Bill Moyers of the Insinkerator , an aproned P.C. guru of Ethnic Self-Esteem ... And his message might be summarized ( as he says ) " thusly " : The Oppressed make better sausages . Give him Latvian dwarfs in funny hats cooking up a mess of tripe and snails in peanut butter and blueberry sauce , and he 's in heaven : " We should all taste the whole world .... That 's an old Biblical doctrine  --  to eat with someone is more intimate than making love , " he says . He wrote The Frugal Gourmet Cooks American " as an effort , " he says , " at digesting American history . " ( " Keep us mindful of those who starve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will do as instructed and " think of ( my ) own childhood " whilst sitting down to a repast of Northwest Indian oolichan grease ( oil from little fermented fish " mixed ... with raspberries to make a kind of ice cream " ) , it may be true that there are those for whom lamb-innard soup is " a bowl of memories . " Pity . The Frug wants us to " eat history rather than analyze it .... If I do n't cook anything today , " he tells his television audience , " it wo n't matter , particularly if you 're a young person .... Understand how difficult it has been for the Japanese to maintain integrity in this country . " Well , that 's what he said ; he was tying " an itty-bitty seaweed belt " around a piece of sushi and talking about the detention of Japanese in camps during World War II at the time ... Please do n't ask me to explain . I will never " find ( myself ) using Serbian Pork Seasoning regularly , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large fresh octopus leg , about two to three pounds . " But , oh ! He makes me so happy , in an imbecilic kind of way ; he gives me leave to hate wholeheartedly while roaring with laughter  --  an antiseptic kind of hatred for which I ought , I suppose , to be grateful to him : a noncorrosive hatred that is the opposite of toxic . In him I encounter viscerally the P.C. culture in all its ragged absurdity ; and I find the encounter mind-scouring  --  although , I admit , it took me six months of concentrated watching ( and reading ) before I understood that I was engaged in more than just a random exercise in masochism . Generally speaking , I am not attracted to that by which I am repulsed ; he is the exception that preposterously proves the rule . He loves everyone . He does not love food : " I am primarily a people lover .... The events of the meal , the friends gathered , the family excited over the coming dishes are much more important to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no wonder , when what 's on the plate are dishes made with frozen spinach and tinned artichokes ; or a cheater 's Bolognese sauce made with canned tomato paste , precooked shredded pot roast , and no provision at all for bathing ground beef in milk and wine so as to make it velvety ; or Persian lamb tongues ( " trim any cartilage and fat from the base " ) , Swedish pancakes with heated Hershey 's chocolate syrup , or looed duck feet ( " spit out the toes " ) . He is proof perfect of the axiom that to love everyone is to love no one . While he performs in a warm muddle of sentiment , he does allow himself to get angry at " Americans . " But since he adores all our " immigrant ancestors "  --  even Native Americans , he says , must be thought of as immigrants , since they came here from Siberia  --  it is hard to know exactly who he means . He appears to mean " Puritans , " who stalk , bloody-minded and invisible , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vigor . He wishes most calculatedly not to give offense . The result is a romantic blur that has very little to do with food ; the bipolarities of his affections betray him as they do a politician in an election year : one from column A , the industrialized world built on the shoulders of our immigrant ancestors ; one from column B , the quaint , nonviolent , serene , offshore oppressed . Never mind . His words are forever engraved in my heart ( which is where he would like us to park our pork vindaloo : " Mix this up in your mouth and your heart with curry ... " ) . Words such as " Hebrew was a desert language and as concrete as the desert . " He does n't always reach such inspired heights ; but " hospitality is simply rampant " in Greece is pretty good ; likewise " the German immigrants who came to this country were not all waiters . Not at all . " And I immensely like being exhorted to eat pasta " el Dante . " Almost as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prayer of thanksgiving to the Great One . It is a prayer in which you address the salmon and thank him for coming to your table .

" All the fine old frugal ways Of the early Pilgrim years Have the power to wake in me A deep sober ecstasy Close akin to tears . He wrote that , do n't you know . He wrote that in The Frugal Gourmet Cooks American , before it occurred to him that he despises Puritans : " In American theology there is nothing about the history of the table . Why ? Because Puritans were taught from the time they were little kids that they were not supposed to show their passions . Which means hunger is the biggest passion , so you 're not supposed to really enjoy food . That is why we sit with one hand in our lap . Dumbest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now speaks with multicultural missionary zeal ; he embraces the virtues of tribalism : " The tribal mindset sees value in a person simply because he is a person . He is a member of the tribe and therefore everything is shared with that member . Puritan and European thinking stems from the belief that the only value a person has is connected with his ability to produce or manufacture .... For those of us who are white and decide to share , it is a matter of decision , not of custom or mores or ethical laws . No , the Native American gave us food and taught us how to use ( it ) because he felt he should .... And now he is so very sorry . He is tragically sorry . " Nothing compared to how sorry I am to be told that I am valued only according to my ability to produce  --  an error , if I may say so , that the Word became flesh and dwelt among us in order to refute . Although I am tempted to accuse the author of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temperately point out that every notion in the above sentimental lay to tribalism is , as sentiment so often is , contradicted by Scripture ( the injunction to love one another is not widely regarded as a tribal imperative ) , common sense , received doctrine ( which instructs us that we all have volition , tribes included ) , and the daily newspaper ( is tribalism cutesy-wootsy when it acts , by slaughter , to exclude from communal love the tribe around the corner ? ) . Once , in a restaurant in Milan " on a May day ... I kept closing my eyes and relishing the flavor " of risotto con funghi . " The waiter finally told me I would have to order lunch , as this dish was simply considered a pasta course . " I see two possibilities in this story , which contradicts every eating experience I have ever had in Italy . One : the Milanese waiter thought he was dealing with an epileptic and quite wisely wanted to have done with him . And two : the Frug , his reiterated love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his contempt for the working class  --  " In Rome , the center of some of the most historically profound uses of food , assume that many taxi drivers are dishonest . " I assume nothing of the sort . ( But , on the other hand , I ca n't churn up any great enthusiasm for " vestral ( sic ) virgins " either . ) There is a third possibility : this that he said happened on a day in May in Milan never happened , and is merely his way of conveying useless informationettes to us  --  " The primary use for beans in the Mediterranean has always been for food "  --  which are often , in any case , wrong ( " Italians do not make lasagna much " ) . " The Japanese have a very long and involved name for everything .... You and I should all speak Japanese . Japanese and Spanish , kiddo , that 's what it 's gon na be , that 's what we should do . No No No No No . I 'm not asking us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cutesifies the world and everything volatile in it . How dare he call me kiddo . " Do n't let anybody talk you out of the knowledge that the tomato originated in North America . " Why does this man turn purple asserting what I would n't dream of denying ? " Blacks were Native Americans as much as any other culture .... Do n't tell me that we 're talking about something that is other than American , or foreign , that 's just nonsense . " I do n't want to tell him anything ... I did want to interview him . Give the fella a break , I thought . Maybe he could in the flesh convince me of his good faith  --  the flesh often converts us to different points of view or allows us to see the point in what had seemed pointless or pernicious . And he does invite his readers and viewers to call him . All the time . Forget about it . I called and called . His business manager , James Paddleford , said the Frug thought it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He said it the second time I called , and the third , and the fourth , and the fifth . But he never called me back . Maybe he thought I was a Puritan . Why do people lap up his arts-and-craftsy pretentious approach to food , which owes nothing to art , science , or sensuality ? The short answer is that we live in a debased intellectual climate . Why have they made him the guru cook of our troubled times ? For an inspirational buzz that exacts no intellectual toll and obliges one to do nothing but be the passive recipient of factoids ... For the same reason people take guided tours : to take home fortune cookies , packaged wisdom , not too stressful on the brain . And , loving everybody , he gives us all somebody to hate : the Puritan , a bogeyman we never meet at the grocery store , a specter who never tries to rent our apartment or take away our job . Why is he beloved ? The short answer is that people are stupid . He is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfy " a hunger for meaning . " People are not stupid ; they are needy . And he panders , the result being spiritual and political malnutrition ... and sweet-and-sour pan-braised tongues with pine nuts . Why do people allow themselves to be patronized ? Probably because , in spite of the fact that we are forever told that our trouble is lack of self-esteem , we are all indeed guilty of something ; he 's a minister  --  he knows this . People like small , manageable worlds  --  hence our enduring fascination with dollhouses , our addiction to epigrammatic bestsellers , our attachment to slogans and buzzwords that address complexity without unraveling it . In a world of terrifying complexity , we keep the furniture of our minds tidy , light , disposable , ready for the next change of fashion , the season 's trend . He deals in capsule histories  --  thimble histories . To the history of the Vietnamese ( " very family-oriented " ) he devotes one and a half pages , and comes up with this conclusion : " Many nations suffered tremendous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cambodia , and Laos . " His factoids are the kinds of things that make you gnash your teeth when you hear them from lazy , ill-informed tourists who take pride in never having eaten in a tourist restaurant ( Stay out of those tourist restaurants , just stay out of them ! he says . Why ? ) or from the mouths of terminally dopey know-it-alls : " The Japanese do everything in the most elegant manner possible . Everything is so aesthetic ! " " In Rome they love artichokes more than anything else . " " I consider the Chinese the greatest chefs in the world and the wise ones behind noodles ; they do more with the noodle than anybody else . " " Venus de Milo 's bellybutton was the pattern for tortellini . " " Have you ever thought of the influence Rome had on the Western world ? " George Washington ate one of Martha 's hams every day at three o'clock . He also " treated his slaves quite well .

He likes something called advieh , a combination of spices the fragrance of which " is reminiscent of Persian nights , temples , and flying carpets . " I would rather chew boiled erasers . Actually , there is one recipe of his I quite like . It comes from Hong Kong ( " where you will find the most profound and exciting Chinese food available " ) : Place in a pot of boiling water a three-pound chicken . When the water stops boiling , remove the chicken . Cover the pot and bring the water back to the boil . When it boils again , put the chicken back in the pot and the pot on the burner ; but turn off the heat . After an hour the chicken will be poached . This is nice because you get firm flesh and the flavor remains in the chicken .... You might want to give it a little more than an hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bloody near the bone .... If you 're scared of salmonella , that is .... " Chickens are always kind to us . So treat him well . " Oh , do something with your noodle ! One does not wish to be patronized by the Frugal Gourmet . He 's good at it . Smarmy . Unctuous . Let me count the ways : It 's always " Mama " who buys the chicken . How does he know it 's " Mama " ? Maybe it 's a slut . Japan : " I think they are the most fascinating culture .... Brilliant and wonderful people .... They have the highest level of education you could possibly imagine  --  artists , musicians , scientists . Oh ! Oh ! Yo Yo Ma ! " ( He 's Chinese . ) Morocco : " Very unusual people from a very unusual country with a fabulous cuisine ... a major part of the world .... They were called the Berbers in the beginning .

This is the land of Casablanca , of fezzes and clinking of glasses and dark taverns and cigar smoke and all the romantic things we think of . " Ah , romantic cigar smoke , fragrant as flying carpets . And , being tribal and all , they share everything . Except , of course  --  but we do n't hear about this from him  --  when they do n't ; except when they 're carving up their enemies and grinding their bones to make mortar for triumphal gateways . The point about the romantic Moroccans , of course , is that they are just as bad  --  and , one supposes , just as good  --  as the rest of us . Do n't they teach Original Sin at Drew Theological ?

The use of lard , however , had not : I retched ( although I 'm not especially squeamish  --  I was once required to eat sheep 's eyes curry in Andhra Pradesh for breakfast , and carried off my obligations to my hosts reasonably well , considering ) . I retched because lard seemed to be the medium for national expression ; my salvation lay in caviar and in gooey desserts smothered in whipped cream , which disguised the lard .

He tells us so , One has no sense of his ever having been there , of this having happened in actual time and real space ; this is a man , after all , who is so insistent upon his own sensibilities  --  he cries a lot  --  that he passes the Tartaruga Fountain in the Jewish ghetto ( Rome 's loveliest fountain ) without a glance or a word for it . It is in the background . He is in the foreground ... as he always is : " The Berlin Wall fell while I was cooking German dumplings . Then , Lithuania called for freedom while I was cooking Kugelis . " Cause and effect , perhaps ? Greece  --  which taught the Romans " how to catch and appreciate fish " : " So gracious that it is embarrassing . " But " Watch the cabbie . He might try and take you for too much money . " Wales : " Absolutely charming .... This culture has produced some great intellectuals , among them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " and because the F. was " brought to tears with the stories of the tribulations of this wonderful people "  --  " the Turks caused wholesale massacre ... like the Jewish Holocaust "  --  Turks are granted no space in The Frugal Gourmet on Our Immigrant Ancestors . What can you do with a man like that ? And what , one wonders , is the cutoff point ? I read in my paper this morning that Armenian militants killed a thousand people in one small town in Azerbaijan in one week : Do we stop eating Armenian stuffed meatballs now ? Or what ? He is coy . He suggests using " beef caps " for sausages . Ask your sausage maker about beef caps , he says . So I do some research . I get , by means too tedious to detail , as far as " bung . " Then I call the Jefferson Market in Manhattan and ask what beef caps are . They hang up on me . They think I am talking dirty . I call The Sausage Maker in Buffalo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a prim voice tells me . Yes , but made of what ? " The p word , " the voice says  --  " p-e-n-i-s . " " Please do not fill your kitchen with appliances that you will rarely use . " For his recipes he uses : a noodle bird-nest fryer ; a couscousier ; a truffle cutter ; a tostone press for the purpose of flattening out slices of plantains  --  " one of the great foods of Puerto Rico " ; also a flavor injector  --  " a strange-looking plastic device that resembles a hypodermic needle and is used for injecting flavors and juices into meats . " I was afraid of something like that . I have it in mind to plumb the depths of his condescension  --  but first I want to get to his innards . According to the Frug : ( 1 ) " Since prehistoric times " aristocratic Chinese and Italians ate innards  --  " the most prized part " of the animal . ( 2 ) In ancient Rome only peasants ate innards , and the aristocracy ate the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we seem to feel that ( innards ) are symbols of poverty . In our three ancient cuisines , however , they were symbols of delight and joy at the table ... offered at the most exclusive banquets . " Well , you tell me ; I can make no sense of it but to conclude that as long as he is putting down aristos and telling a story , accuracy can go and get stuffed . Putting down aristos , a form of fake and Capraesque piety , is a sure way to purchase television success  --  Oprah Winfrey , for example ( also a Windy Citizen ) , says she always speaks for and with her studio audiences , they are in perfect synch  --  and , the thing is , she 's right . Achieving the lowest common denominator requires much honed intuition and skill ; it is an art . I reckon it is true that " certain foods are so fascinating " ( and " Italians like salad " ) . I would like someone who has given it some serious consideration to tell me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food " as opposed to " sophisticated food . " The last time I was in Italy , for example , I ate , in the province of Molise , which has been called Italy 's hillbilly country , a sublime dish of risotto cooked in wine with porcini and truffles . The people of Molise , rich and poor , eat seasonal foods . Truffles were in season . So is this peasant food ? Or sophisticated food ? Please tell . He never will ... He thinks porcini are dried mushrooms ; they are not ; they are boletus edulis , big wild mushrooms , fresh or dried ... Anyone who ventures into print makes blunders ; it 's the combination of error , pontification , and showmanship that vexes . You did n't know that , did you ? In his world boys are always " lads , " chefs are always " charming and handsome , " little old men are always beautiful and wise , and a black woman cooking in the South is " enormous and gorgeous ... and she does n't use MSG  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Taste your memories , " he exhorts his black listeners , " barbecued ribs help you remember who you are .

What cook  --  what ministerial cook  --  would tell his listeners to eat real Jewish food in the ghetto , blithely urging upon them spaghetti carbonara , the ingredients for which are bacon ( actually pancetta ) , eggs , cream , and cheese ? Is he nuts ? Anyone with an irritable sensibility might conclude that his encomium to the Jews is indistinguishable from anti-Semitism : " Jews have been persecuted due to their commitment to their religious faith , which must come prior to any commitment to a particular country .... Jews have always valued education , good business , and the arts .... The most educated segment of our society , all have been the victims of prejudice since the Jews feel " called " or chosen in terms of their place in world history .

In solitude  --  " privatude "  --  is born vice ... and art . TFG quotes " the author Gertrude Louise Cheney , " who , at age nine , observed : " All people are made alike .

They are  --  alas !  --  Roman Catholic . Mr. Smith is not particularly fond of the Roman Church . What saves the Irish from his scorn is the fact that they managed to be oppressed by the English , whom he likes even less ... and the fact that he married an Irish woman , Patty Smith ( " a true American patriot " ) .

I do n't know why I should be surprised , all things considered , that he has an utterly tin ear when it comes to the conundrums , dilemmas , challenges , anxieties , and hopes of immigrants : in his stagy world , first-generation immigrants say to their children , " You are becoming too American . Do n't you respect us anymore ? " The truth is far more complicated , and far more poignant . ( It has nothing to do with The Peaceable Kingdom , children sitting with animals , " nobody biting anyone , William Penn and the Indians in the background all getting along . " ) I am the child of one Italian immigrant parent , one native-born American parent , and four Italian immigrant grandparents . I know that for many children of immigrants , a great deal of life 's tension resided in parents and grandparents wanting us to become American ... and not wanting us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ? was not waiting for us in the seven or eight or nine fish dishes the Frug variously claims we eat on Christmas Eve ( in every Italian-American family I know , it 's twelve fish dishes ) ; I can assure you that baccala never solved anyone 's identity problem . What am I ? is , in any case , the question we used to ask one another in grade school . ( The answer  --  unless one was blonde Veronica , who was " American "  --  was Italian , or Jewish . ) The grown-up question is , Who am I ? ... Who am I in relation to God and my fellow humans ? And reading tea leaves or eating haggis and fish pudding is not likely to provide the answers . " I 'm trying to get rid of the secrecy , the gnosticism " is a sentence as opaque to me as " It is hard for Americans to understand the meaning of an appetizer . " That 's the kind of theologian he is . This is the kind of theologian he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dependent on something outside yourself . " Of course it does not . A nonbeliever is perfectly capable of studying theology , which is a discipline ( not an appetizer ) . I asked a couple of theology students , and one distinguished professor of theology , to parse these sentences for me : " The Gospel of St. John talks about creation just before being was . Remember ? I think that is when I learned to cook . " They could not . Maybe I should have asked Shirley MacLaine . Only a man who tells us that Moroccan baked omelets , " called Kuku , are more flavorful than anything you have tasted in either France or Spain " would have the appallingly bad taste to entertain us with this anecdote : Following his ordination , a friend and mentor asked , " " Well , can you do it ? Can you change a perfectly good wine into , ugh , blood ? ... Jeff , listen to me . Always remember that no priest should ever raise the chalice and pronounce the presence of the healing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the congregation and state the vintage , and state it proudly . ' He was right , of course . " He was wrong , of course . How starved we are .
