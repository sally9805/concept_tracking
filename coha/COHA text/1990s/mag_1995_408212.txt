John Chancellor had it all figured out . After a distinguished 43-year career as a TV journalist  --  culminating in his job as anchorman , then commentator on the NBC Nightly News between 1970 and 1993  --  Chancellor looked forward to sharing a comfortable retirement with Barbara , his wife of 36 years , in their federal-style house in Princeton , Instead , last April , at 67 , he was diagnosed with stomach cancer  --  a relatively rare but aggressive form of malignancy that struck 24,000 Americans and claimed 14,000 lives in 1994 . " There was n't a cloud on the horizon , and then this , " says Chancellor who had just finished narrating Ken Burns 's Baseball documentary for PBS . " It made me mad and frightened  --  and that 's a very toxic cocktail . " After collecting their thoughts , he and Barbara immediately phoned their three grown children  --  Mary , 43 ) from Chancellor 's first marriage ) , Laura , 37 , and Barnaby , 35  --  and broke the news . Chancellor promptly underwent surgery , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radiation treatments . Buoyed by calls and notes from colleagues  --  including Walter Cronkite , Tom Brokaw , Jane Pauley and Peter Jennings  --  Chancellor says he was " feeling better in September and suddenly Baseball was on the air . It was as though I 'd been brought back to life . " Born in Chicago , Chancellor attended the University of Illinois and was a cub reporter at the Chicago Sun-Times before joining NBC News in 1950 . A foreign correspondent and host of the Today show in the early ' ' 60s , he has covered four wars and interviewed every U.S. President since Harry Truman . Chancellor spoke about his cancer battle with senior writer Peter Castro . I BEGAN TO GET THE STOMACHaches last April  --  sharp , annoying pains that came after meals . I immediately thought it was an ulcer . So when I went to the doctor two weeks later  --  I was working against deadline on a book project  --  I was smiling , because I thought that getting an ulcer after retirement was , in a mordant way , kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 40 years on the job but gets an ulcer in the throbbing heart of Princeton . The doctor performed an endoscopy , which entails being anesthetized and having a tiny camera put in your stomach by sticking a tube down your throat . He took one look and knew right away that I had cancer . Because I was still woozy , Barbara got the diagnosis first . So when I got home she said , " Well , I 've had a talk with the surgeon . " And I said , " Yes , so have I. " Being the kind of people we are , we did n't have a big emotional scene and just went on about our business that night . But obviously we were scared to death . I was scheduled to undergo surgery to remove the tumor at Princeton Medical Center seven days later , so for a week I sat around the house and brooded . I did n't go stand out on the cliffs staring at the Atlantic or make out my last will and testament ; at the time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a sensible , or at least hopeful , person like me thought , " Well , they 'll get it all . " But the tumor was situated so that it was impossible to remove all of it . Doctors did , however , remove half my stomach . They had to leave some of the diseased tissue and told me in terms of recovery I 'd be under a statistical shadow for some time to come . That 's when the really deep notes on the organ began sounding in my head . I thought , " Oh , God , this ca n't happen to me . I 'm going to die . " I also had to deal with feelings of guilt . Had I smoked or drunk too much , or not exercised or prayed enough ? Cancer did n't run in the family , and I wondered , " Why me " I never thought my number would come up  --  I thought I 'd die in bed at a great age surrounded by sobbing great-grandchildren . But after a few days I realized that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BBC writer who died last year of pancreatic cancer , said of his illness : " Fate blew me a little kiss . " And that was all . Pretty soon I got over the feeling that I was somehow responsible . After two weeks of recovering from the surgery , I checked out of the hospital , went back home  --  and spent the next month regaining my strength for the ordeal I knew awaited me . On June 21 the chemotherapy and radiation treatments began simultaneously in Princeton . Five times a week I went to a local hospital for radiation treatments , which was like being in a toaster with the setting on dark . Chemo , meanwhile , required a pump strapped around my waist that dripped the chemicals into my bloodstream 24 hours a day . The treatments made me very ill . I was seriously nauseous , had terrible diarrhea and often refused to eat because I thought I was going to lose it all anyway . I had to hook myself up to an intravenous machine every night that pumped 800 to 1,000 calories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into my stomach while I slept , to compensate for all the food I was throwing up . Between May and early August , I lost 30 pounds . My doctors ordered me to have six meals a day and eat anything I wanted  --  eggs , bacon , cakes , pies , all the bad things I had n't eaten in years . I discovered aisles in supermarkets that I had never visited before . Still , I acquired a lassitude of the dead . I was so tired it was scary . I would sit on the couch and just keel over in the middle of conversations , then nap for an hour . When I did manage to stay awake , I 'd sit in one spot and just feel sick for hours . It was hard to read , which was a severe penalty for me . And then there 's the vertigo ; the room begins to spin and you think you 're going to be flung off the chair at the breakfast table . Fortunately my hair did n't fall out during the chemo . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which was an eerie experience . I no longer had to go to the barber . I got enormous help from Barbara . She ended up being best friend , nurse , cook , manager and housekeeper . I have one piece of advice for anybody who 's going through this with a loved one : Keep your sense of humor . At the worst times , a cheerful face and a sense of proportion really helps you come through . Barbara was cheerful throughout  --  during the summer , when we did n't know whether any of this radiation or chemo would work , she never stopped smiling . I 'd say , " I 'm sorry I ca n't eat this food that you 've slaved to make for me " or , " I 'm sorry I have to go throw up again . " I felt embarrassed , but she found ways of not making me feel shame . She 's a pearl beyond price . There was something else I learned that 's important . I always felt that reporters were a special breed  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and I allowed myself to believe that statistics affected everybody but me . When I got cancer , it robbed me of my self-anointed special status and made me an ordinary guy . And that was a real downer . I was one of the common herd . While I 'm feeling much less despair these days , it has n't even occurred to me to declare victory ; I do n't know if I 'll ever get to that point , Next month it all could start again  --  cancer can lurk in your body in ways that are undetectable . For now , I have to go for checkups every four weeks , which include blood tests , X-rays and CAT scans  --  something I 'll have to do for the rest of my life . Meantime , I 've booked a couple of lectures  --  one this month in Hawaii  --  and as soon as I get last summer 's mail answered I 'm going to resume work on a book  --  a kind of eyewitness account of the effect television has had on American politics . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get back to the life I had before I got sick . Cancer is the single most frightening thing that 's ever happened to me . But I 'm not depressed by it so much as I am alerted by it . Cancer underscores your mortality  --  it 's a reminder of how short a leash you 're on . As I read somewhere , " You want to make God laugh ? Tell him your plans . " <p>
