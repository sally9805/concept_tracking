Dr. Gresham Bayne practices medicine in some pretty unusual places . Just last month the San Diego physician was worshipping at the Point Loma Community Presbyterian Church when a fellow parishioner collapsed in her pew . Rather than call 911 to rush the 96-year-old woman to the hospital , Bayne asked the ushers to take her to the church parlor . The doctor , who is something of a gadget freak , was equipped for any contingency . Stashed in his black bag  --  actually a blue-and-gray fishing-tackle box  --  was a miniaturized version of every diagnostic tool he needed to assess her symptoms , as well as a full supply of standard emergency-care drugs to treat them . " You 've got to stop thinking about bricks and mortar , " Bayne says . " Today I am the emergency room . " <P> Welcome to pocket-size medicine . The revolution in microelectronics that gave us cellular phones and palmtop computers now allows doctors like Bayne to take their healing arts out of the hospital and onto the road . The result : fully functional EKG machines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no larger than a princess phone ; portable ultrasound machines that fit in the trunk of a car . There is even a hand-held mri scanner in the works that is about the size and shape of a catcher 's mitt . And last week the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved a paperback-size automatic defibrillator that can shock a stopped heart back into a normal rhythm . <P> Bayne took full advantage of the new technology that Sunday morning in Point Loma . Although he could not feel a pulse at his patient 's wrist , he was able to determine that it had fallen from a normal 80 beats a minute to 38 by placing a digital pulse monitor the size of a lemon on the woman 's finger . He then touched her chest with a portable EKG machine and analyzed her cardiac rhythms . Had there been any indication that she was suffering a heart attack , Bayne would immediately have called 911 . When he determined that was n't the case , he decided to perform a battery of blood tests . <P> No sooner said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drew a sample , injected it into a tiny cassette and snapped it into a hand-held blood analyzer . Within two minutes , all readings came up normal . There was no sign of dehydration , anemia , insulin shock or kidney failure . " In a standard emergency room , it would have taken me 30 minutes to an hour to get those test results , " Bayne says . <P> Questioning his patient , Bayne finally deduced that a prescription drug she was taking had caused her heart to slow , decreasing the flow of oxygen to her brain and sending her into a faint . That settled , he administered a stimulant called atropine to strengthen her heartbeat . Total elapsed time from pew to recovery : eight minutes , just about as long as it would have taken to get her to the emergency room in an ambulance .                                       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
