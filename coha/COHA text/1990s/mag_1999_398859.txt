An exhibition at the National Museum of American Art illustrated how artists turned one region 's past into the image of an ideal America . <p> If American art has a spiritual homeland , it 's probably New England . Winslow Homer 's stormy seascapes , Edward Hopper 's lonely lighthouses , Willard Metcalf 's pristine snowbound villages , Norman Rockwell 's gangly Yankee " Everyman , " Andrew Wyeth 's haunting , weather-beaten farms the list of hallowed American images inspired by New England settings , personalities , and moods could extend almost indefinitely . Despite increasing competition from other regions and cosmopolitan centers such as New York , the country 's tiny northeast corner dominated the look and substance of American art for almost a century . <p> An engaging exhibition on view at the National Museum of American Art in Washington , DC , last summer explored the historical scope and meaning of New England 's imagery in a survey of American painting and sculpture produced between the Civil War and World War II . Consisting of more than 150 works by nearly 100 artists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Singer Sargent , Childe Hassam , John Marin , Marsden Hartley , and other well-known masters  --  " Picturing Old New England : Image and Memory " examined how a new , enduring American myth emerged in art a century ago in response to the pressures of relentless , disorienting changes in American life . <p> Before the Civil War , a vision of the land as a natural paradise inspired American artists . The Hudson River School painters , such as Thomas Cole , Frederic E. Church , and Asher Durand , saw ordained harmony in the beauty of wild American spaces . But the horrors of the war spoiled that vision . Besides , the country had clearly changed ; industrialization , immigration , and urbanization were creating a bustling modern society in place of the pastoral , pre-Civil War provincial America . <p> Few artists wanted to confront this chaotic postbellum America . Many went to Europe to steep themselves in the refinements of Old World traditions . Those artists who remained at home sought , half consciously , for a new ideal to replace the optimistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the efforts of post-Civil War artists , led by major figures such as Homer and the sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens , focused on a constellation of New England subjects . The region 's appeal was manifold . Many of the artists were native New Englanders , and Boston could still boast of itself as the country 's cultural capital , as at the rime , New York was a mere bumptious upstart . As the cradle of American liberty and the scene of such pivotal events as the Boston Tea Party and the Battle of Concord , New England was closely associated with the nation 's founding principles , the touchstone of democratic values . <p> Finally , Yankee virtues  --  the stoic faith , dogged persistence , and cooperative ingenuity of farmers and village tradesmen  --  had triumphed over the genteel , aristocratic code of the plantation South . After the defeat of the Confederacy , the flinty , plainspoken Yankee emerged as the authentic personification of the American spirit . <p> Yet in the 1870s and 1880s , New England itself was profoundly changing . It was the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 60 percent immigrant or first-generation American . So , as the artists fashioned a new national ideal along the sturdy lines of the victorious Yankee , they had to be selective . Increasingly , they portrayed the region in terms of its agrarian , Anglo-Saxon past . In art , New England became " old New England , " a spiritual homeland bypassed by progress and immune to change . <p> The Colonial Revival , as it was called , inspired vigorous flowerings in historical painting , portraiture , and public sculpture . Daniel Chester French 's Concord Minute Man of 1775 showed the citizen/soldier of the American Revolution with one hand on his plow , the other clutching his musket . There 's no exaggerated heroism in the pose , just a smoldering , don't-push-me determination to defend his liberty . French 's bronze became an instant American icon , and it made his career , setting the stage for his commission to sculpt the seated Lincoln at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington , DC . <p> Saint-Gaudens ' The Puritan ( Deacon Samuel Chapin ) , a large-scale bronze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneath patriotic pride to the roots of New England 's spirituality and its history of religious zealotry and intolerance . Saint-Gaudens transformed his Puritan deacon into a fantastic insectlike creature , with a shiny , beetle-shaped body , a flaring cape for wings , and a severe , doomsday visage . <p> Related paintings , like Henry Mosler 's Pilgrim Grace , sought to rekindle the old-time religion . But as the Gilded Age unfolded , few prosperous Americans wished to ponder the wages of sin . More popular were pictures like Eastman Johnson 's The Old Stage Coach , in which children clamber over a wheelless hulk labeled Mayflower : metaphorically , the now motionless vehicle of Puritan experience wrapped safely in the innocence of childhood memories . <p> Johnson was one of many 19th-century artists who enshrined New England 's folkways . John Whetten Ehninger 's October , depicting an old-fashioned pumpkin harvest in the Berkshire Hills , exists on the cusp between realism and nostalgia . It calls to mind the peasant paintings of French artist Jean-Francois Millet , then much in vogue with American collectors . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action , specializing in nostalgic scenes of rural life , often associated with images of childhood  --  barefoot farm boys , bonneted shepherdesses , one-room schools  --  though in fact many of his subjects at this time came from upstate New York , not New England . Homer 's work often appeared as illustrations in magazines like Harper 's and Scribner 's , which amplified their tremendous popularity . <p> This popular nostalgia industry had an upscale counterpart in society portraiture , where Sargent reigned supreme . Portraits of the New England elite by earlier masters like John Singleton Copley and Gilbert Stuart hung in the homes of many of Sargent 's patrons , who wished to be similarly immortalized . Such dashing elegance as Sargent brought to his 1901 portrait of Mrs. William C. Endicott had not been seen in American art since the days of Stuart . Sargent 's suave brushwork instantly immortalized his sitters , magically transporting them to a world safely beyond the reach of change . <p> Such images , whether patrician or mass-marketed , buffered against the shock of the new , which surrounded Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political assassinations , skyscrapers , telephones , the suffragist movement . As change intensified , artists responded with powerful new visions of stability and endurance . <p> The most durable feature of old New England is its geology , the literal bedrock of the continent . It 's remarkable how many works in " Picturing Old New England " featured mountains and rocks , particularly rocks along the coast . The earliest , William Stanley Haseltine 's Rocks at Nahant , an eerily placid view of a coastal formation in Massachusetts , was painted in 1864 , as Union and Confederate armies slaughtered each other in Virginia . <p> Homer discovered the theme of rocks in the 1880s , after he 'd retreated from the modern world to the isolated coastal village of Prout 's Neck , Maine . In High Cliffs , Coast of Maine , the artist resolved his contemporaries ' anxieties about change into an image of the eternal contest between sea and land . Compared to the elemental drama of nature , the mere human concerns signified by the three tiny figures at the top right dwindle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued well into the 20th century . Rockwell Kent 's Toilers of the Sea shows fishermen in dories off Monhegan Island , off the coast of Maine . Rising precipitously from the water behind them , a naked wall of rock offers not shelter but the prospect of disaster  --  perhaps , the translation of Saint-Gaudens ' doomsday Puritan into a landmass . <p> Hartley picked up on the fascination with rocks when , in 1931 , he returned to his native New England after many years abroad . Meditating on the boulders of a glacial moraine called Dogtown Common , outside Gloucester , Massachusetts , he cleared his work of acquired mannerisms and painted , for the first time , in a style all his own . Hartley is represented here by later Maine paintings of Mount Katahdin and by the curious Lobster Oh Black Background , which looks for all the world like an antique Down East shop sign . <p> Beginning in the 1890s , American artists returning from Europe introduced a host of new styles and art theories . Of all the disruptive changes taking place at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modernism which elevated the artist 's subjectivity and formal inventiveness above the claims of any " national " subject matter  --  seemed to pose the greatest threat to the collective mythologizing of old New England in art . <p> Yet , as presented in " Picturing Old New England , " artists quickly and smoothly accommodated the new styles to New England subjects . In effect , they poured the old New England wine into sparkling new bottles . The American Impressionists particularly favored New England settings for their high-keyed landscapes . Hassam 's The South Ledges , Appledore presents a view very similar to the elemental coastal imagery of Homer , though sunnier in mood . <p> So durable and adaptable did the myth of old New England prove to be that even radically modernist artists of the 1920s and 1930s chose to paint there . New England imagery gave legitimacy and backbone to the expressionistic experiments of Marin , as in Pertaining to Stonington Harbor , Maine , #1 . <p> Of Hartley 's New England homecoming , the painter/poet later wrote , " He who finds will/to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welcome . " <p> The need to find " old faith made new again " was never greater than during the twin crises of the Great Depression and World War II , which gave added resonance to New England life and scenery . Lighthouses  --  those beacons in the darkness , promising guidance , reassurance , hope  --  began appearing in coastal views by Hopper , George Ault , and many other artists . <p> Among his neighbors in the village of Stockbridge , Massachusetts , Rockwell found models for the American values and character traits he universalized in his Four Freedoms series . Freedom From Want lovingly celebrates that quintessential New England feast , Thanksgiving dinner . <p> " Picturing Old New England " ended with World War II , though the myth of old New England and its hold on the American imagination have never died . Archetypal New England images have become cliches  --  Homer 's grizzled mariners sell frozen fish sticks on TV but that only proves they 've been well loved and well used . A number of artists featured in the exhibition  --  among them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enrich the nation 's memory bank with New England imagery in the mid-20th century and beyond . Lately a younger generation of New England regionalists has emerged to carry on the tradition . <p> Paul Rickert 's Clear Day Clouds , Stonington depicts a classic New England subject : white clapboard , Victorian-era buildings overlooking the picturesque harbor of Stonington , Maine . The work 's luminosity and large scale mark it as a contemporary watercolor , but the artist has pushed modern life  --  a motorized trawler and pleasure boats in the harbor  --  into the distance , concentrating instead Oh the brilliance of the clear , maritime light . <p> Like Rickert , Joseph McGurl distances himself from the modern world through the use of deep perspectives , as in View Towards Boston , Squaw Rock . Skyscrapers and smokestacks Oh the horizon , and the motorboat speeding across the choppy harbor , are dwarfed by natural forms : the wide foreground beach , the rocky promontory ( a recent take on the immortal theme of rocks ) , and the broad expanse of summer sky . The romantic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to nature , harks back to the sublime vistas of raid- 19th-century American landscape painters . <p> As the 21st century dawns , some modernist-oriented critics still contend that art , to be any good , must be on the cutting edge of change , matching the innovations of science and technology shock for shock . Yet after decades of avant-garde " breakthroughs , " contemporary art seems of less consequence in the life of the culture today than it did 30 years ago . <p> The insights offered by " Picturing Old New England " suggest that the traditional fine arts could play a more vital role in our rapidly evolving high-tech civilization . Art 's greatest value today may be as a buffering agent and stabilizing force , counterbalancing technologically advanced and chaotic social disruptions with visions of enduring beauty and shared ideals . Without that essential stability , both society and art grow colder and more nihilistic , haunted by the prospect of change for change 's sake . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Toilers of the Sea ( detail ) , by Rockwell Kent , 1907 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Museum of American Art , New Britain , Connecticut .
