OFF-ROAD RACING SUFFERS AS MARKETING DOLLARS GO ELSEWHERE ... LIKE , TO YOU BY DELAINE FRAGNOLI // Mountain bike racing sucks . That 's the message the bike industry , pro team managers and amateur racers are sending NORBA ( National Off-Road Bicycle Association ) . At a November meeting , the managers summed up the situation : flagging participation , drooping spectator numbers and a flat TV product . Ironically , the bust could be a boon for recreational knobheads . The meeting came amid announcements that Schwinn , Specialized , Mongoose and Jamis were dropping all or part of their teams , and Fisher and Yeti were financing just one rider apiece . Industry insiders list a number of reasons for the pullout : poor performances by Americans , pre-Olympic overspending , post-Olympic letdown , escalating salaries for top pros , lack of mainstream media attention ( particularly for cross-country ) , NORBAs inability to market the national championship series ( NCS ) , and the general expense of supporting separate World Cup downhill and cross-country teams . Meanwhile , amateur racers have been reciting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ registration procedures Byzantine , venues out-of-the-way , courses uninspiring and crowded , prizes paltry , start times cruelly early . To combat these problems , NORBA has formed the advisory NORBA 2000 Board , consisting of racers , promoters , industry representatives and media . NORBA has also announced a series of changes , the most shocking of which is a restructuring of the NCS cross-country event for elite riders . The proposed new format includes a traditional cross-country race on Friday with top qualifiers racing the main event , a " spectator- and TV  --  friendly " criterium , on Saturday or Sunday . So far the plan has drawn criticism for being " extreme when there are more obvious solutions " and Ua sell-out . " A reporter for the bike-racing tabloid VeloNews suggested that " turning crosscountry into a made-for-TV dog and pony show sucks soul from a sport founded on soul . " In the " old days " a race was an all-day adventure culminating in a party . You could cycle with friends and family if you wanted ; heck , you might , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Overend . Rather than a manicured circuit at a contained ski resort , the route , more often than not , was point-to-point or one huge loop , and it took you to backcountry places you might never otherwise visit . Photograph GOING DOWNHILL FAST : // Seeking to recapture a sense of fun and adventure , more and more recreational riders are trying " alternative " events : off-road triathlons ( such as Scott Tinley 's Dirty Adventures ) , 24-hour races ( Canaan ) , enduros , ultras , fun rides and festivals . And there 's room for more . These types of events can benefit from the industry cutbacks to pro racing . Poor or flat bike sales over the last few years have manufacturers questioning how to spend their marketing dollars . Although most budgets remain the same ( according to the trade magazine Bicycle Retailer and Industry News , ) companies are allocating money differently . Look for alternative events and consumer shows to capture these funds . Schwinn , Specialized , Trek , GT , Mavic , SRAM and Shimano all have plans to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
