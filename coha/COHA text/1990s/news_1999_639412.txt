<p> In an office straight out of 1966 - equipped with a rotary phone , a globe and a Royal typewriter on the desk - an old man sips his morning coffee and leafs through files full of nothing . <p> Down the street and around the corner , the two-chair beauty shop is alive with idle chatter . And from the homey front porch of the Mountain House , Fay Brookins takes in the buzz of a cozy little town she knows as Wellspring . <p> ' This is great , ' she says with a faint smile . ' It 's a good place we 're OK . ' <p> Like the other 30 folks here - those strolling past Town Hall , lounging outside near the sensory garden or sweating it out in the Juniper Gym &; Spa - Brookins has Alzheimer 's disease . <p> In less than six years , she has regressed from a brilliant puppeteer to a woman who refuses to touch her marionettes , who , in one heartbreaking moment of clarity , r told her husband the puppets ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of Fay , her husband says , understands what the disease has stolen , the cold reality of its irreparable wreckage . But she is happy inside this warm illusion - a mock village of homes and shops under one roof . <p> ' My wife will sit and talk with the residents , ' Ed Brookins says . ' As the staff told me , we do n't understand what they 're saying to each other , they 're just talking back and forth . But they are getting by the whole atmosphere is positive . ' <p> Welcome to the front line of Alzheimer 's treatment : sunny , secure ' assisted-living ' complexes that offer patients a literal stroll down memory lane , past working sweet shops and coffee bistros - settings that made them comfortable in another life . <p> Aurora facility first <p> Wellspring At Aurora was the first of these new-wave communities to be built from the ground up in the Denver area , according to the Rocky Mountain chapter of the Alzheimer 's Association . <p> The 52-bed boarding home opened in February @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Front Range . Alzheimer's-specialized homes have become hot commodities because their clientele keeps growing . <p> Today , 4 million Americans are thought to have the progressive brain disease - which first pokes holes in memory , then gradually chips away personalities , language and the ability to care for oneself . People over 65 are most at risk . As the U.S. population ages , the numbers will grow . Health officials estimate that 14 million people will have the disorder by 2020 unless an effective treatment is discovered . <p> Familiar things <p> With no known cure , the best medicine may be to stir patients ' memories with familiar aromas , sights and sounds , experts say . And that 's exactly what Wellspring throws at its residents and day-care clients . <p> ' We tried to create a real destination , ' says Megan Carnarius , a nurse who helped draw up the community . ' We did n't spare anything . ' <p> Based on a ' town square ' design , four individually themed homes surround a faux hamlet complete with business signs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therapeutic purpose . At the Juniper Gym &; Spa , clients can drop in for a massage or for a jaunt on the stationary bike . A hot tub can be filled with warm water to soothe tired muscles - but it 's also a clever way to bathe reluctant residents . The same strategy lies behind Beauty Salon and Barber Shop . <p> As the disease progresses , many Alzheimer 's patients either forget hygiene and hair care or refuse to let other people touch them . For caregivers , it can be a daily battle . <p> ' So we wanted to give them other options . We can say something like , ' You have an appointment at the spa - a massage and a hot tub . Let 's go ! " Carnarius says . <p> Throughout the complex , automatic spritzers pump out a potpourri of aromas - each with a medicinal function . Whiffs of citrus or pine help lethargic residents wake up ; camomile or geranium oils help agitated residents relax . <p> ' Then I can avoid using a sedative , ' Carnarius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' One woman here , all she did was what we call ' agenda speaking , ' repeating the same things all the time . She smelled sage one day and said , ' Oh , this reminds me of Thanksgiving . ' Then she visualized everyone at the Thanksgiving table and said , ' Oh , and I remember Uncle Bob . He drank too much ! " <p> At each corner of the town square sits a themed house with a front porch , a full kitchen , a living room , a dining room , a laundry and 12 bedrooms . ( A full-time room costs $ 3,600 a month . ) Interior designs range from the darker furniture and formal decor of the Garden House to the washed woods of the Lake House . <p> While the differing facades help confused residents find their way home , they also give them a sense that a walk around the block actually took them somewhere , Carnarius says . <p> ' I really feel like people need more places to go than just to the corner and back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting lost are typical in many Alzheimer 's patients . Shredded short-term memories cause them to forget their way or where they were headed . Another symptom is called ' sundowning ' - extreme agitation , restlessness and wandering that kicks in around 4 p.m . <p> Giving residents a safe place and free rein to burn off nervous energy is critical , Carnarius says . But it also means Alzheimer 's facilities need to have high walls on their outdoor courtyards and locked doors to the world beyond . <p> One male resident ' went over their fence ' at Wellspring soon after it opened , said Linda Mitchell , director of the state 's Alzheimer 's Association . ' He ended up back at home , which was good . <p> ' That can happen everywhere . We do have people with the disease that make it their life 's work to escape , ' Mitchell says . ' There have been other situations they 've had to deal with , being new and not having a very experienced staff <p> ' It 's been a struggle for every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff . They 've had the same problems as everybody else , ' Mitchell says . ' People working in nursing-assisted kinds of jobs now have more opportunities in retail , in service industries where there 's more money and easier work , frankly . ' <p> A check of records at the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment found no complaints on file regarding Wellspring . And a federally funded ' ombudsman ' assigned to the home said her visits have always found the residents ' content ' and that the staff ' really focused on the individuals and their needs . ' <p> Before enrolling his wife in a dropoff day-care program at Wellspring , Ed Brookins says he checked the place out thoroughly . <p> ' We went on a tour on a Monday , ' he says , ' and she seemed to like the place I went right into the office and told them we 'd like to join the day program . They asked , ' When ? ' And I said , ' Would tomorrow be too soon ? " <p> Demanding care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he felt as if he was losing his already-tenuous grip on his wife 's around-the-clock care . Fay had roamed away a few times , once in a nightgown and bare feet to the entrance of their neighborhood . She refused to bathe . She was incontinent and hallucinating about house guests or pets who were n't there . <p> ' The spousal relationship is the most difficult because I do n't have a wife anymore . The person I 've been with is gone , ' he says . ' It 's one of the most eroding diseases possible for the person and the caregiver . It 's totally changed my life . ' <p> On weekday mornings , Ed now checks his wife into Wellspring between 8 and 9 a.m. , then picks her up between 3 and 4 p.m . It gives him time to run errands , pay the bills or do some shopping . While he 's gone , Fay likes to sit on the porches and talk , wander around the town square or occasionally join in word games . <p> Most of all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life as a painter . He works in watercolors , and some of his pieces are on display at area businesses . The money helps pay for Fay 's care . The work keeps Ed going . <p> And it 's one of the few things Fay still remembers about her husband of 50 years . <p> ' He is , ' she says proudly , ' a good artist . ' @p#
