Section : World report ; Cover story Death of a nation The largest country on earth is disintegrating , and so far there is no one who can save it <p> Dateline : Soviet Union <p> Russia is plagued by two great misfortunes-the power of darkness at the bottom and the darkness of power at the top . <p> - Vladimir Gilyarovsky , turn-of-the-century Russian writer <p> In a small , largely symbolic attempt to narrow the chasm between the Soviet Union 's leaders and its dispirited , increasingly angry people , Mikhail Gorbachev descended last week from the Soviet elite 's traditional perch atop Lenin 's tomb to lead marchers through Red Square on the 73rd anniversary of the Russian Revolution . <p> But the gravity of the moment became clear when Gorbachev stepped to the microphone to open the annual military parade , usurping an honor traditionally reserved for the Defense Minister . The last Soviet leader to speak at the ceremony was Joseph Stalin : In 1941 , he urged his soldiers on to victory as they passed the reviewing stand and marched toward the outskirts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armies saved the Soviet Union from Hitler 's invaders , but Gorbachev faces an even tougher task : He must save the Soviet Union from itself , from national aspirations that Communism repressed but never conquered , from ethnic and religious hatreds that have never healed and from the mounting chaos unleashed by his own halting reforms . If Gorbachev fails , if the economic collapse and ethnic strife that are tearing the nation apart can not be reversed , the Soviet Union will either disintegrate into a loose confederation of independent states , explode into warring families and factions or succumb to yet another cycle of repression . Time is running out , and Gorbachev 's prospects for success seem as slim as Stalin 's in that autumn of 1941 . <p> A raw , still-whispered emotion is seeping into Soviet apartments and courtyard playgrounds : Fear . Of hunger . Of anarchy . Of crime , violence and repression , of a cataclysmic end to Gorbachev 's short-lived second revolution . The giddy glasnost days are long gone . Excitement over political liberalization has faded . Even the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alarm that anarchy is imminent - or that it will be avoided only by the return of the iron fist , propelled this time by seething intolerance of everyone , everything and every idea that is not Russian . <p> The Soviet Union 's 15 republics may be able to negotiate new political and economic arrangements among themselves , but within the republics , ethnic feuds simmer , fueled by the fact that 60 million Soviet citizens live outside their own homelands . The old voices of anti-Semitism and xenophobia are back : In an interview with the Jewish journal Vestnik , Viktor Yakushev , a member of the far right group Pamyat , denounced " Zionist-Masons " as " bio-robots , programmed for self-destruction . This is a scientifically proven fact , and we have arrived at such evidence through experimental means . In addition , 6 to 8 times more Zionists are insane than people among the non-Jewish population . ' <p> Soviet society is suffering a collective nervous breakdown . The latest public-opinion samples by reform sociologist Tatyana Zaslavskaya show that less than 2 percent of the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent a year ago . Just 14 percent of those polled trust the government , compared with 34 percent a year ago . " I have noticed an enormous amount of anxiety and fatigue , a sort of universal exhaustion of the nervous system , ' she says . <p> Historical catastrophe . While the latest Soviet military hardware was being wheeled through Red Square last week , three blocks away demonstrators mourned Lenin 's revolution as a historical catastrophe for Russia . Just across the Moscow River , Soviet teenagers spend the night outside the House of Shoes , gulping shots of vodka to ward off the chill . First in line come morning , they each legally buy a pair of winter boots for 160 rubles , half an average monthly salary . Then they sell the boots outside the store to desperate shoppers for as much as 700 rubles . Militia officers watch impassively ; shoppers are near panic , and the officers are more worried about violence than speculation . The kids say they have paid the cops to look the other way . <p> The evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Viewers are less impressed with the Americanness of the delicacy than they are with the fact that it is made without eggs . In the first nine months of the year , Tass reports , egg production fell short of its target by 1.7 billion eggs , largely because of feed shortages . Despite bumper crops , many areas will go hungry this winter . Izvestia reported that on October 3 , 6,544 freight cars of vegetables and fruit were waiting to be unloaded , and 2,405 more freight cars of potatoes were waiting in line . Meanwhile , a shortage of covered rail cars has cut off salt supplies , forcing bakeries and food-processing plants to close all across the U.S.S.R. According to government statistics , 996 of 1,000 common consumer products are unavailable in most stores , and 71 million of the Soviet Union 's 289 million people are destitute , living on the equivalent of $15 a month or less . Meantime , inflation is estimated at 20 percent or more , amid fears it could soar to triple digits . <p> According to Ivan Silayev , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down in 40 Russian cities , and 40 percent of the Republic 's food processing and oil refining equipment no longer works . The military still siphons off labor , raw materials and investment , says Silayev : Sixty percent of the enterprises in Russia work either directly or indirectly for the military , and this year , investment in housing and other social programs has reached only 30 percent of the republic 's targets . Production in light industries , by some estimates , will fall 30 to 40 percent next year . <p> Epidemics and emigrants . Diphtheria rages in Moscow ; there is bubonic plague in Central Asia . Parents do n't have their children vaccinated because single-use syringes are rare , and those that can be found often are reused . Infected needles , not sexual contact , are the leading cause of AIDS . Nearly a million people have been uprooted by ethnic violence , economic chaos or natural disasters , and 3 million Soviet citizens could emigrate in the next two years . ( See story , page 49 . ) <p> Many of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own ways . Leningrad and Estonia have established their own customs posts to regulate trade between them , and Estonia is on the verge of issuing its own currency . Russian officials are delving into foreign policy with proposals to return the Kuril Islands to Japan . Lithuania has agreed to set up a diplomatic mission in Prague . <p> Gorbachev has tried to be both his country 's Abraham Lincoln and its Franklin Roosevelt . He has failed at both roles , because of his own shortcomings and because of the intractability of his nation 's problems . Gorbachev-Lincoln is struggling to hold together a union that is split not only along economic and ideological lines but also by ethnic and religious animosities . Gorbachev-Roosevelt is forging a New Deal to save an economy that may be beyond salvation . <p> Gorbachev has amassed formal presidential powers that Roosevelt would envy , and he is unfettered by an independent judiciary or a powerful opposition party . But , having never submitted to a popular election , he lacks legitimacy , his presidential decrees are ignored and he has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action is needed . Lately he has displayed a growing inclination toward authoritarianism , but it may be too late even for the last resort . The military and the KGB are riven by the same forces that are tearing apart Soviet society , and there no longer is any guarantee that they will come if he does call them . ( See story , page 46 . ) <p> As the cancer spreads , Gorbachev is warning that the Soviet Union is at a " decisive moment " in its history . " There is no room for retreat , " he told a group of students recently . " If retreat continues , the economy , state and political structures will disintegrate . ' In such a volatile environment , it is difficult to tell what might follow the U.S.S.R. , but some scenarios for a post-Soviet era are emerging : <p> Confederation . Despite the deep-seated animosity among some Soviet republics , they have equally powerful reasons to maintain a semblance of unity . Indeed , the economic interdependency fostered by the socialist system is one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decades of subsidies , trade between 11 of the republics and the rest of the Soviet Union accounts for 40 to 60 percent of the republics ' economic output . Moreover , industries are made up mainly of state monopolies . The problem is that each of these single-source manufacturers is located in one part of the country . Latvia , for example , makes most of the country 's telephones , and virtually all oil-drilling equipment comes from Azerbaijan . Thus , disruptions in one region can affect the entire country . <p> In an association built largely on their economic interdependence , not political unity , the republics could create a loose , voluntary confederation or commonwealth , in which they would claim almost total sovereignty , much as Australia does within the British Commonwealth . ( Yeltsin has suggested that Gorbachev should be content to be a figurehead leader , like the Queen of England . ) <p> Gorbachev , however , is desperately trying to preserve both a centralized structure and his own power with a proposed Union Treaty that could be submitted to the republics by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kremlin most likely would retain its powers over defense , monetary policy , taxes and foreign affairs while granting the republics enough autonomy to blunt harsher demands for independence . " He wants to share responsibility but not power , ' says Dimitri Simes of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace . <p> But Gorbachev 's interest in preserving a strong Kremlin and his fear of a market economy are plain . A November 2 presidential decree outraged local leaders , economic reformers and factory managers alike by ordering that 40 percent of all hard-currency earnings be paid to the central government , and that the remainder be subject to ordinary taxes . Ninety percent of what remains after both levies must be paid into a special union-republican hard-currency fund controlled by a committee chaired by Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov . <p> Once again , Gorbachev 's efforts may be too little , too late . In a nation stripped of its ideology and devoid of hope , people are searching for charismatic leaders ; Gorbachev filled that role briefly , but his failures have caught up with him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's possible he could suffer the same fate now that he is the leader of the Russian Republic . <p> The only rallying cries anyone is answering are those of sovereignty , ethnic nationalism and autarchy . Even a loose confederation is unlikely to hold all 15 republics , especially as local leaders conclude that their only hope for survival is to seize control of their own resources and sever their economies from the worthless Soviet ruble . In short , they want control of money and patronage . Russia already is negotiating treaties with neighboring republics and bartering oil with Latvia for electronic equipment . The Baltic States and Moldavia want nothing to do with the Soviet political system , period . <p> Martial law . Gorbachev may conclude that he has only two options for holding on to power : Submit to an election or invoke the iron fist . With a Moscow News poll showing that Gorbachev 's approval rating has plummeted from 52 percent at the beginning of the year to 21 percent now , the first option is not particularly appealing . The latter could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even put some food back in the shops . <p> The Army , the KGB and the military-industrial complex remain a powerful force in a disintegrating empire , and a move toward authoritarianism would only enhance their influence and autonomy . Jerry Hough of Duke University believes the U.S.S.R. is " moving toward an authoritarian regime like that of Franco or Noriega . ' Azerbaijan is already under martial law to control ethnic violence ; last week , Gorbachev sent Interior Ministry troops to Moldavia to keep order . <p> W. Bruce Lincoln , a professor of Russian history at Northern Illinois University , says Gorbachev 's attempt at reform has run into the centuries-old dilemma of proizvol , or arbitrary authority , capriciously applied . " It can be tyrannical , " says Lincoln , " but at the same time the major reform movements in Russia have come as a result of proizvol 's being applied at the top . ' The problem , says Lincoln , is balancing the good and bad effects of authoritarian rule : " If you do n't want proizvol to run wild , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some kind of lawfulness . We do n't have that yet in Russia . ' <p> Some critics of the regime charge that the Kremlin is using the KGB to exacerbate economic and political troubles to set the stage for a crackdown , if not martial law . Andrejs Krastins , vice president of the Supreme Council of Latvia , says he believes the central authorities are fanning local ethnic unrest in places such as Moldavia in an attempt to put the leaders of independence-minded republics on the defensive . <p> Martial law could win some grudging support from Soviets tired of instability and uncertainty , but it also could spark crippling strikes among miners or railroad workers - or even a general strike-that could paralyze the country . <p> A sea of nations . The Soviet Union could give birth to a number of middle-sized countries . The Ukraine has a population of 53 million , coal , ports on the Black Sea and a land mass larger than France ; Russia and the Baltic States also could survive as independent nations . Or the Ukraine , Bulgaria and Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pan-Slavic nation stretching from Sakhalin Island to Serbia . That , one U.S. official suggests wryly , would create a unified Slavic nation and leave the troubled Caucasus a " free-fire zone . " <p> Civil war . Many argue that a new civil war already has begun . But instead of a repeat of the 1917-21 war between Reds and Whites , it consists of chaotic , rolling clashes by mobs of hungry , angry citizens and score-settling battles among ethnic enemies . But if a broader war begins it is unclear who would fight whom , and for what . Socialism ? Mother Russia ? Democracy ? A free Ukraine ? The absence of any natural battle cry other than Russia for Russians , Georgia for Georgians and so forth underscores the depths of the Soviet Union 's identity crisis . <p> Until a crunch comes , the Soviet Union may be doomed to muddle through , with power waning at the top but not trickling down to the bottom . No group or leader has been able to capitalize on Communism 's failure or to satisfy a dispirited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 73rd anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution , the Soviet Union is a country in which every community , every political group , every economic entity and every movement is deeply frustrated . All of them are losing ground , in retreat and afraid of the future . The Leninist forces of the old party are scrambling to save themselves . After continuous vacillation and inertia , the Gorbachev camp finally has realized that it must make a stand or be swept away . <p> Gorbachev 's troubles should be a boon to his budding opposition , but this is not the case . The anti-Communist democrats , populists and pragmatists have become painfully aware of how shallow their support is . As officeholders , many " New Democrats " have been unable to respond to what preoccupies the Soviet people most - their economic plight and the threat of anarchy . They are divided into 33 different parties , none with more than 10,000 members , and they are poorly organized and financed . Once loosely unified in their attacks on the Communist apparat , they now quarrel with one another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and money . " We are now falling behind , " says Moscow 's reformist mayor , Gavril Popov . " If no progress is made , the mood of the voters will change . They will lose faith in even the most democratic soviet . ' <p> Leningrad , the cradle of the Bolshevik Revolution , illustrates the reformers ' troubles . After Leningraders kicked out the Communists in elections last March , the new city leadership got caught up in abstract debates over issues such as whether to give the city back its old name , St. Petersburg . Meanwhile , the city 's economic and social situation has steadily worsened . In one recent poll , 70 percent of Leningraders said they were disappointed in their new leaders . <p> Criticism of city hall reaches the ridiculous : When an early cold snap hit the city before central heating was turned on this fall , rumors flew that the new city council was withholding heat deliberately so feeble pensioners would die off , freeing up badly needed housing . " People think you could get rid of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be democracy , ' says Mikhail Zolotonosov , a political analyst at the popular Leningrad newspaper Chas Pik ( Rush Hour ) . " That 's not true . " <p> The council 's unwieldy size - 400 members - leaves most power in the hands of its executive committee , which still is dominated by Communists . As a result , the apparatchiks have checkmated the city 's democratic mayor , Anatoly Sobchak . <p> New Democrats also are finding that the bureaucracy simply ignores their legislation , particularly radical reform measures . The Moscow city council has passed a string of radical reforms that have not been put into practice , including private ownership of apartments and a requirement that buildings owned by the Communist Party be turned over to help ease the housing shortage . A Leningrad prison director left a deputy of the Leningrad Soviet cooling his heels in the prison lobby for 3 hours , then dismissed him as lacking any real power . <p> Where bosses still rule . Nor does the new democracy reach much beyond the cities . Provincial party bosses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even where radicals have been elected to councils . The democratic movement is weak in Central Asia and the Soviet Far East , where old-style party and nationalist bosses remain strong . Corruption , endemic in the Soviet system , further retards reform : Shortages increase the value of bribes . <p> Some New Democrats are carving out feudal fiefdoms from the remnants of the Soviet empire , ruling locally with impunity and striking deals with one another as needed . Often the fiefdoms clash . Yeltsin 's Russia is clashing with the Kremlin over who has the right to sell diamonds and other Russian natural resources to foreign purchasers , and with the Ukraine over its right to sell oil . <p> If region or republic leaders could find some way to cooperate , the Soviet Union might find some way out of the crisis . But that is n't likely given the atomizing forces of economic decay and religious , ethnic and national animosity . In fact , the forces of disintegration are growing stronger . The Ukraine 's decision this month to begin the transition to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Union . Such steady defiance will dismember the country as surely as bayonets , and even the bloody options are never far afield . The darkness that so troubled Gilyarovsky a century ago is descending . Coffin shortage reported <p> The State Funeral Agency in Orel has stopped making coffins because it has no wood . The agency can " somehow make something " for the deceased whose relatives can supply their own wood . Suggested sources include porch or fence planks . <p> - Trud , a trade-union paper Armenia extends food rationing <p> Armenia introduced ration coupons for cereals , cheese and tobacco November 1 . Sugar , butter and , on occasion , meat and coffee have been rationed for the past few years . <p> - Radio Moscow Skilled workers leaving <p> The Uzbek Council of Ministers is trying to stop the exodus of specialists and skilled workers . Already there is virtually no one to look after the two 300,000-kilowatt generators at the Syrdarya power station , the largest in the republic . <p> - Pravda Vostoka A DISINTEGRATING EMPIRE <p> All of the 15 soviet socialist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their sovereignty , with exception of Kirghizia in Central Asia .
