" Do all your work as though you had a thousand years to live , " said Mother Ann Lee , founder of the Shaker religious sect , " and as you would if you knew you must die tomorrow . " It is no accident that Ken Burns picked the Shakers , who believed that God dwelt in the craftsmanship of their everyday work , as the subject for one of his films . Each of his works seems the labor of a lifetime : a painstaking assemblage of archival photographs , period documents , interviews and music , welded together by narration that can soar to near religious inspiration . <P> Burns is best known for his hugely successful mini-series The Civil War . But this season viewers are getting a chance to see the full breadth of his talent . His first new work since The Civil War debuted in September 1990 , Empire of the Air : The Men Who Made Radio , will be telecast on PBS this Wednesday . On the same night the public network will rerun his Oscar-nominated 1981 film @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be shown in July , and his entire oeuvre has been released on videocassette by Direct Cinema . <P> There 's more to come . Burns is working on a mini-series on the history of baseball , scheduled to air in 1994 . He is overseeing ( though not personally producing ) another major historical series , on the American West . He is also planning a series of 60- and 90-minute biographies of American historical figures , such as Thomas Jefferson and Lewis and Clark . <P> Burns has firmly established himself as the master film chronicler of America 's past . " We 've forgotten , " he says , " that history used to have a popular dimension , that it is in fact made up mostly of the word story . Professional historians have found it convenient to speak only to themselves and have rendered history rather dry or obtuse . And , of course , history is anything but that . " <P> Burns is a celebrator of America , but his work goes deeper than mere patriotism . What fascinates him most is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move civilization forward . In Brooklyn Bridge and The Statue of Liberty , Burns chronicled the building of great structures that came to symbolize far more than stone and steel . What stands out most in The Civil War is the men  --  Lee , Sherman , Lincoln  --  who shaped events by the force of their vision and eloquence . In Huey Long , his marvelous portrait of the Louisiana demagogue , Burns seems attracted as much as repelled by his subject : the amassing of power can be a creative act too . <P> Empire of the Air presents Burns with a tougher subject . The development of radio was a diffuse process that spanned many years and lacks the obvious emotional resonance of Burns ' other subjects . Visually , the documentary has neither the grandeur of The Civil War nor the serene grace of The Shakers : Hands to Work , Hearts to God . Burns ' chief stylistic device here is a periodic fade to black , an attempt to simulate the sightless charms of radio .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
