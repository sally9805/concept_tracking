ANYONE COULD TELL at a glance the two men were brothers . They entered the hospital waiting room speaking to each other in whispers , each holding his hand up to his mouth in precisely the same way . The family resemblance was unmistakable  --  in their features , in their gestures , even in the way middle age was beginning to tug at their under-chins . Yet their dress was so different , one 's was so roughly rural-looking , and the other 's so very elegantly urban ; their haircuts were so different , and even the trim of their fingernails , that they seemed in a sense hardly creatures of the same species . It was nine-thirty on a Saturday morning , and these two brothers were entering the seventh-floor waiting room of the Methodist Hospital . Outside the row of windows on the west side of the room was spread the city of Memphis . In the relatively near distance out there  --  some eight or nine blocks away  --  could be seen the brick and concrete towers of the Baptist Hospital and Campbell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or so beyond that were the half-dozen near-skyscrapers of downtown Memphis , stretched out along the Mississippi River . And beyond the River , as everyone in the waiting room that morning so well knew , lay Arkansas . <p> In the row of chairs by the windows sat a red-haired man and two women . The man , in plaid jacket and gray trousers , was seated between the women . On his left was his sister , also with red hair , not so coppery as the man 's and showing more signs of gray . The diminutive brown-haired woman on his right was his wife . All three figures were twisted halfway round in their chairs and were gazing silently out the windows . Against the north wall of the room sat a solitary young man . He was dark-haired , dark-eyed , dark-suited ; he even wore dark , pointed-toe shoes . But his socks were white , and he wore a white shirt , open at the collar . When the two whispering brothers entered the room , the threesome at the window turned around . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked formally : " How do you find Mrs. Schofield this morning ? Did she rest well ? " <p> " She 's resting nicely , " said the brother in khaki trousers  --  the brother , that is , in a home-knit-looking cardigan sweater and high , waterproof shoes . <p> The other brother smiled politely and shrugged . He clearly meant , by so doing , to qualify or even contradict his brother 's favorable report on the patient in question . This patient , Mrs. Schofield , was the two brothers ' aged mother , who at eighty-seven lay in a coma in a private room down the corridor . The old lady 's heart had begun weakening two days before , and in the time since her two sons were called to her bedside her condition had continued to worsen almost hourly . Except that he knew his brother so well , it would have been difficult for the brother in the navy-blue suit ( and neatly knotted houndstooth tie ) to understand how anyone could describe their mother as " resting nicely . " Only his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country way of wishing to answer all questions as briefly as possible , could account for the falsehood he uttered in reply . And when they had seated themselves on a vinyl couch against the south wall of the waiting room , the blue-suited brother , after carefully adjusting his tie and straightening his ribbed socks , returned the little , brown-haired woman 's courtesy , asking , " How is your father-in-law this morning ? " <p> Before the woman could answer , both her red-haired husband and her red-haired sister-in-law spoke for her , spoke almost in one voice and in identical words : " He is still a very sick man . " Then the two of them smiled at the rather comical coincidences of their expressions , as also did the two brothers . Apparently the coincidence struck the solitary young man across the room as being somewhat more than merely comical . He gave a sudden , loud guffaw . <p> Everyone 's attention was at once turned on him . But in the split second required for them to direct their eyes toward him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He gazed at them solemnly for a moment with his dark eyes . Then , casting his eyes downward and lifting one rather delicately formed hand , he pretended to brush imaginary crumbs from his shirtfront . Since he was the only decidedly young person in the room , the others were able to view his indiscretion with some degree of tolerance . Perhaps they felt especially indulgent toward him since , on the preceding two days , he had always appeared there in the company of an old woman , an old , country woman whom he had permitted to describe herself to the group  --  without any protest on his part  --  as his " grandma " and whom he had suffered to pat him on the knee or hand each time she did so . <p> The other occupants rested their eyes on the young man for a moment , and then they looked at each other . Regardless of this interruption , the brown-haired , little woman who had first spoken now seemed determined to give her own account of her father-in-law 's condition this morning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two little clicks to the latch of her handbag . " Dad Jones is still a very sick man , " she said in an almost challenging tone to her red-haired husband and sister-in-law . And in a politer tone to the two brothers on her right , she added : " But he is doing as well as could be expected after surgery  --  and at his age . We are quite hopeful that he may improve as the day goes on . " Her husband and her sister-in-law looked at her in open dismay . Her optimistic tone seemed almost to make them laugh . And presently they both seemed to be trying to get the attention of the brother in the houndstooth tie , to try to convey to him with a look the true state of their father 's health : that he most probably would not last the day . Yet they only looked ; they said nothing . <p> All of these people had made each other 's acquaintance during the previous two days . All  --  even the young man seated against the north @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning in the sick room with her husband  --  all were aware of a number of important factors in their lives which they had in common . Each of them , for instance , had originated either on a farm or in a small town in Arkansas ; the family of each had been generally dispersed and were for the most part living in Memphis , if not still farther afield ; and the old persons to whose bedsides all had now come were alike not only in being regarded as " terminal cases " but in having been brought to the Methodist Hospital after long sojourns in Memphis nursing homes . This body of information about the experience they shared had not been revealed or comprehended by them in any one dramatic moment or in any series of such moments , and no open acknowledgment of it had been made at all . But during the previous days the information had been gradually and quietly assimilated . A general knowledge had been repressed , most probably , because  --  until this morning  --  there had always been present some non-Arkansan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some visitor whose patient was not his eldest and nearest of kin  --  someone , that is , who could not have understood all they had in common . <p> Just when the two brothers and the threesome at the window had completed their exchanges  --  both spoken and silent  --  and the brothers had seated themselves across the room from the solitary young man , there appeared in the doorway an old country woman . Although she was wearing a different dress this morning and had combed her long , gray hair more carefully than yesterday , even having inserted additional combs where her hair was thickest above the temples , she was recognized by all as the young man 's grandma . She was a remarkably tall old woman with narrow shoulders and wide hips , and she wore an ankle-length dress made of a bright cotton print  --  orange splashes mixed with greens and blues . One could not fail to notice the dress before noticing the face of the woman , its colors were so bright and cheerful and the cut of the material so generous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a boat with a calico sail . Instantly upon seeing her , the dark young man turned his face away to the window . It was as though he were embarrassed by the sight . But the old woman , whose eyes were as bright a blue as any of the several blues in her dress , seemed momentarily unaware of her grandson , or at least no more aware of him than of the others present . " Well I declare , " she said , still hesitating in the doorway and looking about the room . " Well , I declare . It 's nobody but us this morning . " <p> Her declaration was made in a rather high-pitched drawl , and her voice revealed more astonishment than joy over the company she found . Her blue eyes , in their deep sockets , darted glances about the room as though she were made uncomfortable by her discovery , or even were frightened by it . Remaining just inside the doorway , it was almost as if she had stumbled into the wrong waiting room and might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glance did not once settle upon the figure of her grandson . Finally she repeated in a more composed and cheerful tone : " Nobody but us this morning . " <p> As if in response to this somehow , the brother in the sweater and khaki trousers came quickly to his feet . " Now , do n't go getting up for me , " the old woman protested . " There are plenty of chairs and to spare . " But the red-haired man by the window stood up also . And after him the brother in the houndstooth tie  --  he smiling , and somewhat shamefaced . Surely their getting up this way in a public room , for a woman whose very name they barely knew , was something none of them would have done if there had been anyone besides themselves present . <p> And now the wife of the red-haired man was about to inquire about the old woman 's husband . She had parted her lips to speak when the old woman herself interrupted . " I do declare , " she said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I never saw so many gentlemen in one room . " <p> At this , her grandson came also to his feet . As he did so he continued to gaze toward the window without having once looked at the old woman in the doorway . It was as if he could not bear to look at her , or perhaps did not dare to . Yet it was his rising that the old woman seemed to find altogether overwhelming . The moment he was on his feet , she rushed to his side and threw her great frame down in a chair beside him . " Now ! " she said . " Now you all sit down . Standing up that way you make me feel a-thousand-and-one years old . " She sounded positively silly , almost flirtatious . " I may have one foot in the grave , " she went on , " but I still do n't want everybody putting themselves out for me . " <p> When the men had sat down again , this old country woman bent forward in her chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the view from which her grandson had still not taken his eyes . " I declare it 's a beautiful day out there , despite everything , " she said . " And has n't this Memphis grown into a fine city . It do n't seem like the same place it used to be . Not the town I came to fifteen years ago when my own mamma was sick and I had brought her over here to Methodist . Nothing looks the same . It 's a lot prettier place now , though . Tall skyscrapers over yonder , so flat and white , like fence posts coming up so straight out of the green trees . Like so many tombstones , they are  --  like whitewashed tombstones in some nice , well-kept cemetery . " <p> The old woman 's burst of loquacity seemed to be amazing to everybody present . Even her grandson stole a glance at her . Yesterday and the day before  --  at moments when self-introductions were being made  --  she had rather grudgingly explained to the other visitors who she was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but for the most part she had remained grim-faced and silent  --  no less so than her grandson , himself . And now they all suddenly recognized in her a different type , recognized the garrulous old country woman whom you could not afford to encourage lest she bend your ear all day . <p> Except for the stolen glance from her grandson , there was no response whatsoever to her lyrical outburst about Memphis . After a moment or two of silence , during which she and the young man beside her continued to gaze out the window , she spoke again . " We had a right bad time with Mr. Glover last night , " she said , her eyes still on the skyline . " He took a notion he would leave the hospital ! " <p> The brother in the cardigan sweater exclaimed , " You do n't say ! " <p> The tiny , brown-haired woman sat forward in her chair , and her eyes widened noticeably . <p> The others looked at her with obvious interest . Who " Mr. Glover " was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not known the woman 's own name was Glover , her listeners could have told from her old-fashioned , wifely tone that it was her husband she referred to . " I was nodding in my chair beside his bed , " she went on , " when all of a sudden the poor patient in the other bed commenced shouting , He 's out of his head . You better watch him ! ' Or maybe he said , He 's out of his bed . ' That 's what woke me . And there was Mr. Glover leaning against the bed , so weak he could n't hardly stand , peeling off his night shirt . I hauled myself up out of my chair and asked him , And where do you think you 're going , Mr. Glover  --  naked as a bluejay ? ' . . . I want my clothes , ' he said , like some bad little old boy . " The old woman rolled her eyes around the room almost kittenishly . She put her hand to her mouth and seemed to laugh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old woman . " And how come you did n't send after me , " he asked , " if he was making trouble ? " <p> " Oh , you 've done your share of sitting with him , " she answered solemnly , and then she addressed the room : " He sat with his granddaddy many an hour of the night when he was a little fellow coming along . " <p> " Only to keep you from having to , I did , " the young man growled , turning back toward the window . <p> " Many 's the night he 'd rub his granddaddy 's legs and his back and hear his complaints about how he hurt . You see , he stayed home with us till he was near twenty , and then , of course , he went off to New York City where he 'd always said he was going to go when he got to be grown . " She had told all of this to the room only yesterday , but it had been something dragged out of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ourselves , " she continued with enthusiasm . " His daddy left his mamma and cleared out before the little fellow was a year old , and his mamma  --  she was mine and Mr. Glover 's only child  --  died on us , passed away not two years after her husband left . The boy stayed with us till he was near twenty , and after he left , it was n't long till Mr. Glover became more than I could handle . He was in such pain we did n't reckon he 'd last long , so we put him over here in Mrs. Hooker 's Nursing Home , all against his will , poor fellow . " <p> The young man crossed his legs , and recrossed them . " You mean I did , " he growled . And then he addressed the room : " The old guy was killing her , what with her having to wait on him hand and foot around the clock . He would have done her in , in no time . Besides which , he saw his end was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take her with him was what he wanted . It was me that put him in the nursing home . " <p> " Why , yes , indeed , " agreed the old woman . " This here boy has sent back the money for it every month that comes . And to begin with he came back to Memphis from New York City and rented a car and came over and carried Mr. Glover over here to Mrs. Hooker 's Nursing Home . " <p> The young man crossed his legs again , his white socks flashing . " Against his will , " he said with emphasis . " He has n't ever forgave me for it , either . Against her will , too . It 's a nice , clean place , though , where we put him , and they know how to look after him . He 's been there four years , and she 's still alive because of it . " <p> " Which home is that you 've had him in ? " asked the red-haired man . " Did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hooker 's , " supplied the blue-suited brother , who , like the others , had been following the young man 's words with interest . " It 's one of the better small , private homes here in Memphis . " He was a practical businessman and spoke with authority , as someone who had made his way in the Memphis world . Since they were touching on a subject he had made a study of for the benefit of his mother , he felt his information ought to be shared and perhaps made some use of . " I believe they have an excellent staff  --  mostly colored  --  and that the food is mighty good . Their rates are just above average . " <p> " Well , that 's one I do n't know about , " said the red-haired man . It was a subject on which he considered himself also somewhat of an expert . " We 've learned a good deal about them through trial and error , " he said , smiling meaningfully at his sister . " And we 've come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Yes , " said his sister . " Give a little here , take a little there , they 're all about the same . We should know . " She , too , felt that here was a subject she could speak on with some authority and therefore with some pleasure . " We 've had Father in five places , all told . Each one was a little more expensive than the one before , and , as for Dad , he 's liked each one we 've put him in a little bit less than the one before . But they 're all about the same . " <p> " Relatively speaking , yes , " said the blue-suited brother . He gave a depreciative laugh . " Anyway , however good they are , the old folks do n't seem to like them . It 's like sending a child to his first day of school . He does n't like it and does n't know it 's for his own good . " <p> The old woman shifted in her chair and cleared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some places , they tell me , are pretty bad . " <p> " Ah , listen to her , " said the young man , his eyes still on the window . <p> " Oh , yes , some of them are bad , " said the little wife by the window . " They treat the patients  --  the residents , that is  --  like animals , as Dad <p> Jones used to say of one place , like animals in a zoo . And I heard of another place where they regularly get the patients ' medicine mixed up . " <p> Her husband came in quickly : " That 's only hearsay . And , furthermore , Dad was ever one of the worst to complain . We knew that as children . Even Mamma used to say so . You 've just known him as an old man . " He looked at his sister out of the corner of his eye , and they smiled at each other rather sadly , shaking their heads . His wife was overly indulgent , they seemed to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cocked her head to one side , and as she spoke , it was hard to tell if she were addressing her husband and sister-in-law or the whole room . " I do n't care , " she began , " but if we had kept him at home out at Marianna , he would have been happier , he would n't have been so bored . Why , his mind  --  his memory  --  began to slip as soon as he left our house . " <p> Her husband looked at her sympathetically and said , " My father stayed with us , and she was working herself to the bone for my father . She was ruining her health . People ought not to do that , not even for their own kin . " <p> " We could have  --  , " his wife began again . <p> But the old woman interrupted . " I do n't mean to say that Mrs. Hooker 's Home is one of these bad ones . " She was clearly afraid she had offended her grandson , and wished to placate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folks there , and we were lucky to have gotten Mr. Glover in , and mighty lucky , I say , to have the money to keep him there . It 's only because the boy here worked so hard in New York City and sent the money back . But , still , I do hear some of the places are pretty bad . " <p> " They 're all fairly well regulated nowadays , " said the blue-suited brother reassuringly . " The quality of the meals may differ , and the beds , I suppose . I made a thorough investigation of them before we decided on one for Mother . " <p> The other brother , in his cardigan and waterproof shoes and khaki trousers , had sat with his eyes lowered during most of this talk . Even now he kept his eyes lowered to his hands , and he spoke in a gentle and rather cultivated voice that contrasted with his rough clothing . " There 's only this , " he said . " There 's only this : there are things that can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He lifted his eyes and let his gaze move from face to face around the room . All his timidity seemed gone suddenly . " We had an uncle , our mother 's brother  --  an old bachelor like me , he was , who farmed Mother 's home place near Jonesboro after our grandfather over there died . When he , our uncle , got too old to farm and to look after himself he went into a  --  a church-run rest home over near Pine Bluff . What they have to do in those church-run places , you know , is sign over all their property and savings to the church home , which agrees to care for them for the rest of their lives and even give them pocket money . Well , they put him in a nice private room and all that . It was fine for the first six months or so . But he came down with a chest cold . They transferred him to an infirmary , put him in an open ward . When he improved , he found he had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his private room back . He was a timid , country fellow and hated being in the ward with all the talkative retired preachers who were there . He got worse again , and he died before he could ever get his private room back . " <p> There was a general head-shaking around the room and a chorus of ohs . But the blue-suited brother , who was clearly distressed by being reminded of this family story , said , " They treated the old fellow badly , no doubt about that . But there are nearly always two sides to such a story . Uncle Ned never made a good trade in his life . Yet he was very independent ; he did n't consult any of the family about his agreement with that place . And Lord knows it was n't much he had to sign over to the Church . They did n't make any fortune off him , that 's certain . " <p> " Your Uncle Ned 's story , " said the red-haired man spiritedly , as though he were in an argument and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opposite of the way the story usually goes . Your uncle went into the home of his own volition and then regretted it . My father , for instance , did n't want to go , but it became a way of life with him . Much as he has complained and moved from one place to another , he has almost never talked about coming back to us or to my sister here . He 's made friends in each place and he keeps up with which ones are still around and which have passed on . " <p> " Well , as for our mother in there , " said the blue-suited brother , gesturing toward a door down the corridor , " she has made some awfully good friends and had some awfully gay times since she settled at Mount Holly , which is where she had been for three years until now . When my wife and I went by to see her on her last birthday , they were having a big birthday party for her . Why , those old ladies and old gentlemen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were all having the time of their lives . And it is n't just the social life Mother has liked at Mount Holly . There are charity patients  --  even there at Mount Holly . Mother likes giving them money and clothes . And there are even colored patients , and Mother has found it interesting working out relationships with them . In fact , it is a regular microcosm of life there  --  not at all a feeling of isolation . I do n't believe Mother has had an unhappy day since she settled at Mount Holly . " <p> " You mean , do n't you , " said the brother in khaki , " since we settled her there . " <p> " Yes , we had a time making her decide to go , " agreed his brother in blue . " They could n't keep her on the farm . Someone would have to be forever preparing special meals for her and driving her in town to the doctor . And here in Memphis  --  well , my teenage children would have driven her out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out  --  . " <p> " That night , " his brother interrupted , " when we went to her on the porch and told her we had made the arrangements at Mount Holly , she took her cane and got up and walked without help down into the yard . She would n't let us help her or go with her . She went by herself . And we had a hard time finding her , later . But when we did , she laughed at us and asked if we thought she was going to do harm to herself . She kept up her teasing ways with us and her good sense of humor through it all . I still think sometimes she might have got along all right there at the farm with me . " <p> His brother threw back his head and laughed . " Without another woman on the farm ? Why , you 'd have had to get married , Harry , so you 'd have a wife to look after her . " Now his laughter was hearty . " You know you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . <p> The little , brown-haired wife said quite earnestly , " Yes , a woman on the place might really have made it so you could . " <p> The bachelor brother smiled and shrugged . And the married brother said , " Anyway , she gave us quite a scare that night and , believe you me , she enjoyed it . She 's always been a great tease . " <p> " But that 's nothing , " said the red-haired man . " That 's nothing at all to what Dad put us through . You would n't have thought a man with his diabetic neuritis , a serious heart ailment , and nearly blind and deaf could put us through what he did . At home , he kept firing the nurses we got him , as if to prove he did n't need looking after . And he swore that the nurses beat him whenever all the rest of us were out of the house . If the nurses beat him in his own house , he meant for us to understand , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And then finally he proposed marriage to a neighbor woman who came in to see him , promising to leave her all his property but forgetting she already had one invalid husband to take care of . " <p> There was a general tittering in the room . Then the red-haired sister-in-law asked , " But what is one to do with old people ? " It was quite as though this woman and the others present did n't understand that the old woman sitting against the north wall was really an old person who might soon be facing the fate of those they were discussing . But even the old woman herself did n't seem to realize it . With the others , she nodded sympathetically to the rhetorical question . " What is one to do ? " the red-haired woman repeated . " We all wish they did n't have to end their days in those places . But I live in an apartment two blocks from here , with my husband and our two children . My husband and I both work downtown , and we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble is this : the old people 's young people are not really young people any longer . And in every case there are the problems of the home and children . Life has to go on even where there are old people and sick people . The problems become just too much . It 's not like the old days on an Arkansas farm where there was plenty of time and plenty of room , and plenty of hands , too , for taking care of the old folks . " <p> " Let me tell you , " the dark young man joined in abruptly , turning his eyes from the window to the room . " Yes , just let me tell you . The day when I came back home in the car I had rented in Memphis , I found my grandma here looking like a skeleton . She was worked to the bone and about fit for burying , herself . I ran up the stairs to my granddaddy 's room and told him to get out of that bed , told him I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all that pain in his legs and back , and told him I had the money to pay for it , which part was true . I do n't think I 'd ever told him a lie before in my life . And no matter how many lickings he had give me , I had n't ever hated him before either , because in his way he was good to me when I was coming along without any dad of my own  --  as good to me in his way as she was . I had n't ever hated him until I saw what skin and bones he had wore her down to . But I knew I had to hate him , that day , and lie to him till I got him over here to Mrs. Hooker 's Home , where I had already paid a hundred dollars down for him . He and I left Grandma crying in the hall there at home and I lied to him all the way over to Memphis and even after he was in his room at Mrs. Hooker 's . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doctor who came to see him was nothing special and that we were n't going to let him go home again . But it was too late then . He has n't ever forgave me , either . He has n't ever forgave me . Every time my grandmother would go to see him there at Mrs. Hooker 's , he would spend half the visit railing against me . But I had to do it , and I 'm not a bit sorry . You ca n't let them take the living with them ! " <p> " No , " said the blue-suited brother . <p> " No , you ca n't , " agreed the red-haired man . And his sister shook her head in agreement . <p> " But it 's hard , " said the little wife . <p> " I 've found it hard , " said the brother in the sweater , " to think of her ever here in Memphis when she might have been at home where she wanted to be . " <p> The old woman shifted her weight in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ openly to the whole company : " The worst part of it , though , you have n't come near touching on . And like as not , you have n't known it yet . When Mr. Glover climbed out of bed last night , and I asked , ' Where do you think you 're going , naked as a bluejay ? ' he answered me : ' Get me my clothes , woman . I 'm leaving out of here . It 's going home , I am . ' All right , ' I say to him , but not tonight . It 's some fifty miles to Mark Tree . We 'll have to wait till sunup . ' I could see he was half out of his head and only meant to humor him . But he said , It ai n't your home I want to go to , woman . I want to go back to Mrs. Hooker 's Home . That 's where the only friends I have are . That 's where they know how to give me some ease . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room to the doorway , began to shed silent tears . The young man looked up as if he had never before in his life seen her cry and so did n't know what to do . And it was just then that he and the others saw the nurse who had appeared in the doorway . Silently , the plump little nurse crossed the tile floor and stood before the old woman . " He 's gone , " the nurse said in a voice full of gentleness . <p> " What do y ' mean ? " asked the young man , coming to his feet . <p> " All right , ma'am , " said the old woman to the nurse . Then she said , " Sit down , son . " The nurse glanced at the young man , then turned and left the room without looking at anyone else . <p> " Does she mean  --  he 's dead ? " asked the young man , sitting down beside the old woman . <p> " No , son , he died somewhile earlier , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've taken his remains out and to the undertaker 's . " <p> " How come you did n't say so ? How come you sat here talking ? " <p> Now it was only the old woman who stared out the window . She raised her two hands to her head , lifted the combs that were just above her temples and replaced them more firmly in her thick hair . " You would n't have liked being in there , " she explained . " Now , you know you would n't , " she said , as if remonstrating with a child . " Not seeing him the way he was at the last . And I did n't want you to . " As she rose from her chair , her eyes seemed dry again . And as she turned from the window to leave the room , all the men stirred in their chairs . She motioned to them to remain seated . But her grandson came up beside her and placed his arm about her waist and walked beside her through the doorway . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then everyone watched the grandmother and grandson pass down the corridor toward the elevator , the old woman seeming to lean more of her weight on the young man with every step . Just as the doors slid closed , those in the waiting room saw the young man withdraw his arm from his grandmother 's waist , turn away from her in a sudden , spasmodic motion , and quickly throw both his hands up to his face . Then they saw the old woman turn her back to the young man and hide her own face in her hands . <p> The people left in the waiting room looked at each other in silence . When the elevator doors were closed , not a word was spoken among them , not between brother and sister , husband and wife , or brother and brother . What could their silence mean ? Perhaps until a moment before the elevator doors closed they had imagined that the death of the old man would draw his old wife and his grandson closer together , would draw them into closer understanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be of comfort to each other now . As they sat gazing down the corridor toward the closed elevator doors , they could only have been reflecting on how near the end was for their own old ones . And for them was there any other prospect than that view down the corridor and the image of the pair on the elevator , turning their backs to each other , burying their faces in their hands , each giving way to his own sobs and shedding his own tears for what he had not been able to do and all he had had to do ? <p> <p> By PETER TAYLOR <p>
