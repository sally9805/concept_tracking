<p> The shocking moment was reminiscent of 1991 , when Magic Johnson of the Los Angeles Lakers turned the world on its heels with the revelation he had contracted the virus that causes AIDS . <p> This time , it was the camp of boxer Tommy Morrison delivering a stunning right uppercut to the midsection of society , admitting that the handsome 27-year-old star of Rocky V had tested positive for HIV . <p> Of even greater shock value , however , were the utterances of former two-time world heavyweight champion Floyd Patterson , now the head of the New York State Athletic Commission , upon hearing Morrison 's admission . <p> Patterson announced that the state of New York would reverse itself , henceforth requiring all fighters to undergo HIV testing before boxing in the state . <p> Asked why it had taken so long to institute the policy , Patterson said , " " AIDS just came out . I go back to the ' 50s . I fought for 23 years . There was no AIDS . <p> " " I just heard of AIDS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> This from a boxing administrator whose job it is to ensure the utmost in safety and health care for a fighter . <p> Patterson 's statement reflects the widespread lack of education about HIV and AIDS that permeates the world . <p> But the bottom line is Patterson was moved enough by Morrison 's plight to put in place a policy that can only help clean up a sport long viewed as too barbaric and too animalistic . <p> Has Patterson started a trend ? Will the most humbling of experiences into which Morrison has fallen transform the entire face of boxing ? <p> New York is one of several states that - because of events surrounding Morrison - has done a turnabout or is considering a move to make mandatory prefight testing for HIV . <p> " " It could n't have come a moment too soon , " says one Houston boxing promoter who requested anonymity . " " We 're seeing this HIV come up too often . These are young peoples ' lives we 're talking about . <p> " " They 're not just statistics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , no fewer than six professional fighters have tested HIV-positive and subsequently had their licenses to fight suspended or revoked . None has occurred in Texas . <p> Three of the fighters are considered marquee names - Morrison , a heavyweight ; former world middleweight contender Lamar Parks ; and Ruben Palacio of Colombia , who briefly held the World Boxing Association junior featherweight title . <p> Like Morrison , Parks tested HIV-positive before a fight two years ago in Nevada , one of two states that employs the most stringent rules governing boxing . <p> Parks , who in 1993 challenged then-WBA middleweight champion Reggie Johnson of Houston at The Summit and lost , has not fought since his license was suspended by the Nevada State Athletic Commission ( NSAC ) two years ago . <p> Palacio , too , has not fought since discovering in 1993 he had the virus that causes AIDS . <p> But opinion as to whether infected fighters should be denied their livelihood is as varied as the number of people - experts and otherwise - to whom you talk . <p> The same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Dr. Adam Rios , who has spent most of the past decade working in a Houston-based organization that deals with the research and treatment of AIDS patients , views the practice as an intrusion into a fighter 's privacy . <p> But there could be a practical side to mandatory testing as well , he says . <p> " " Mandatory testing is a difficult subject . Is there any scientific reason for which you ( can ) justify mandatory testing ? " Rios says . " " If you take it to a really stringent discussion , probably no . However , is it bad ? <p> " " Well , not really . I think that in that regard Tommy Morrison will have a better life because he will be treated , get better drugs . But endorsing mandatory testing is difficult because it violates the privacy of individuals . <p> " " The weapon is not mandatory testing , the weapon is education . " Promoter Bob Arum , president of Top Rank , Inc. , believes the health , safety and protection of every fighter should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the permanent exclusion of a fighter who tests positive would work toward that end , Arum says . <p> However , medical evidence , according to Dr. Rios , is inconclusive that HIV can be transmitted by a means other than unprotected sexual contact or through intravenous drug use , i.e. , improperly sterilized implements . <p> He sites as further evidence the many health care workers in emergency rooms and doctors of obstetrics and gynecology who routinely work with patients , some of whom may have AIDS or be HIV-positive , and do n't contract the disease . <p> " " The way we get infected is not through contact sports , " Rios says . <p> Robert Karns , chairman of the physicians ' advisory committee of the California Athletic Commission , agrees . <p> " " In the history of the world , since the first cases were reported in 1979 , there has never been a single case proven to have been transmitted in an athletic event , " he says . " " Zero . " <p> Many fighters , though , remain unconvinced . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Morrison sparring partner , hastily began arranging to be tested after learning of Morrison 's condition . <p> " " Man , that 's a surprise . That bothers me a little bit , " Griffin says " " I 'm going to get tested as soon as possible . " George Foreman , who fought Morrison in the summer of 1993 and is a close friend of Dr.Rios , is n't scared by the current controversy . <p> " " If that kid decides he still wants to fight , " says Foreman , " " I 'd be the first one to step in the ring with him . <p> " " If he were to get cut , stop the fight , let him go to the corner and get the bleeding stopped . Then let the fight go on . " <p> When Johnson , defending the WBA middleweight title for the first time , fought Parks , the Illinois native suffered a small cut during the middle of the bout . <p> " " He got a little nick , but it was n't a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quite naturally , I reflected on that when I heard about Tommy . It 's just one of those things where we 're in a profession that when you get cut , they do n't stop it like in pro basketball . <p> " " Then , they have you pulled out of the game until the trainers can contain the blood flow . In boxing , we butt heads , we have a tendency to bleed on each other . I have some mixed emotions about it . " <p> Asked if an infected boxer should be banned for life , Johnson said , " " It 's the guy 's livelihood . <p> " " I 'm pretty sure the people who run boxing are going to come up with something to figure out how to make everybody happy in that situation . " Reaching a happy medium may be tough . <p> For the past eight years , Dr. Valiere Alcena of Montefiore Medical Center in New Rochelle , N.Y. , has warned that in boxing , perhaps more so than any other sport , the transmission of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is among those who think Morrison should never be allowed to fight again . <p> " " I admire Mr. Morrison . I have watched him fight many times , " Alcena says . <p> " " But barring him because of HIV is a very wise decision . <p> Certainly anyone who is HIV-infected should not be boxing , because you ca n't assure they wo n't be cut . Getting cut is part of the business . " <p> Tony Holden , Morrison 's manager , said Monday , " " I do n't ever see us fighting again , or want to . But right now , we 're not concerned about that . " <p> In his first news conference since being told he was HIV-positive last Saturday , Morrison on Thursday asked that he now be looked upon differently by boxing fans . <p> " " I hope I can serve as a warning that living this lifestyle can only lead to one thing , " he said , his voice cracking . " " And that 's misery . <p> " " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important . I honestly believed I had a better chance of winning the lottery than contracting this disease . I 've never been so wrong in my life . " <p> A frequent visitor to the state of Texas and the city of Houston , Morrison never fought in the Lone Star State . Had he done so , the resident of Jay , Okla. , would probably never have been discovered to be HIV-positive while fighting here . <p> During the summer of 1992 , Texas routinely tested for HIV . The practice was stopped in September of ' 92 . Currently , some referees and cornermen use latex gloves for protection , but it 's a voluntary procedure . <p> Ric Valdes , boxing coordinator for the Texas State Boxing Commission , says the Morrison issue has caused a stir within the organization and could force a change in the bylaws . <p> " " It 's an issue that has been very present in our agency during the last few days because of what has occurred , " Valdes says . <p> " " The ( commission ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " " ( HIV testing ) is a good idea in my opinion , " says Jack Garison , executive director of the Department of Licensing and Regulation , which governs boxing in Texas . <p> Six commissioners and an executive director comprise the state 's boxing commission . That body has no regularly scheduled meeting dates . <p> " " They set their own agenda , " Valdes says . But when the commission next convenes , the issue of mandatory prefight HIV testing will be discussed . It takes a majority vote of the commission to amend existing bylaws or ratify new ones . <p> Getting a rule re-instituting HIV testing could take as long as three months . <p> Although Texas is one of many states that frequently hosts boxing events , it is no maverick in terms of operating without HIV testing . California , Oklahoma , Missouri and Connecticut are other boxing hotbeds . None has mandatory tests . <p> That 's frustrating to Johnson , who has been a professional boxer for 12 years . <p> " " We 've got to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personally , I go and get a complete physical before and after each fight . <p> " " That comes out of my own pocket to have that done . Mandatory testing is the way it should be . But unlike the other sports , boxing is the only one where we have no union . The other guys have a players ' union to look out for them . We 're basically on our own . " <p> Johnson is vexed that the HIV issue - and others attendant to the health and safety of fighters during and after their careers - has not been more seriously addressed by the icons of the sport . <p> " " I love the sport , but I 'm beginning to get frustrated because of the business side of it , " says Johnson . <p> " " I just do n't understand why guys who have a big influence on the sport - George Foreman , Sugar Ray Leonard , Evander Holyfield , Pernell Whitaker , and the list goes on - do n't stand up for it . <p> " " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a fighter . ' It 's a continuing cycle . Until the fighters come together and realize that those promoters and the sport really work for us , we do n't work for the sport , this is going to continue . <p> " " It 's sort of like having that slave mentality . I 'm really frustrated with it . " <p> Arizona , Washington , Oregon , Nevada and New Jersey were the only states to test for HIV before Patterson brought New York into line . <p> Morrison , 27 , known more for womanizing and partying than for his ability in the ring , is undergoing a lifestyle metamorphosis . <p> The sport of boxing would do well to imitate . <p> NOTES : The Associated Press contributed to this report .
