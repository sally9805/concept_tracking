<p> As far as homicides go , June 12 , 1994 was " a pretty normal day " in this county . <p> That 's how Scott Carrier of the coroner 's office sees it : six people killed , slightly higher than the daily average of five . Three died by gunshot , the usual weapon . At least three knew their killers , also typical . <p> But two of the people killed a year ago Monday were Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman . And the trial of their alleged assailant , People vs . Orenthal James Simpson , is a story that still demands the nation 's attention . <p> For those close to Nicole Simpson and Goldman , grief is a painful , public spectacle . The families of the other four people killed that day have grieved in obscurity . <p> Dealing with a criminal justice system deluged by other priorities and a media machine that has given them scant attention , the families feel the people they loved and lost have been robbed of justice . <p> Those homicides drew no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By Simpson standards , the police investigations were fleeting . In one case , there was no suspect . In a second , the suspect was never found . <p> In two more cases , one killing was deemed justifiable and the other suspect pleaded guilty to manslaughter - decisions that torment both families . <p> In fact , if O.J. Simpson were to be found guilty in the slashing deaths of his ex-wife and her friend , he would be the only person convicted of murder in any of the six cases . <p> " I get so frustrated , " says Phyllis Abraham , 29 . Her husband , David , was killed in an unsolved robbery-homicide . She ca n't help comparing the details of that investigation to the resources applied to Simpson 's case . <p> " They spend all this money on the DNA tests , and all I want to know is what happened to the fingerprints on my husband 's car , " she says . <p> If there were any prints . Detectives say they dusted the car David Abraham was driving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assertion - in part , they say , because police never bothered telling them . <p> That 's one of the great frustrations for victims : Information comes in such meager doses . For those four families , the judicial system - and the crimes that transformed their lives - remains a mystery . And on top of that , they have their frustration fueled each day by the Simpson coverage . <p> Here are the " other " victims of June 12 , 1994 , based on interviews with family and friends , and on court records . <p> The biggest puzzle <p> David Abraham 's death was unique for that day . If police are right , he was the only one killed by a stranger . <p> A resident of Rialto , 40 miles east of Los Angeles , he worked with developmentally disabled children in the San Fernando valley community of Granada Hills . Yet his body was found face down in a rundown neighborhood of the city 's Crenshaw district - at least 20 miles south of the route between home and job . His car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twice and robbed of virtually everything , including his checkbook , keys and wallet . He was left with 68 cents , two gold hoops in one ear and the pager he had hidden . <p> The killer , or killers , left no clues , says homicide Det . Chuck Tizano . " We had no suspects or witnesses . . . . He just appeared to be . . . the victim of a carjacking or robbery . " <p> After Abraham 's death , stolen checks began arriving at the bank , eventually totaling about $ 5,000 . The family , led by an aunt , interviewed merchants , unearthed descriptions and license plate numbers . But that information went nowhere after being given to police . <p> Detective Tizano remembers one license plate number that yielded nothing . He says the checks were n't useful because Abraham 's wife had tossed out other checks . <p> Phyllis Abraham still struggles with theories . She thinks her husband 's business promoting rap groups might have taken him to Crenshaw . " They say he was killed there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , " she says . " If he stopped somewhere on his way home , he 'd call me . " <p> She agonizes over the shortage of information . In other murders , she says , " everybody else has somebody to point a finger at . I 'm not sure whether O.J. did it or not , but at least ( the families ) get a trial . I 'm just all up in the air . " <p> There 's been fear , too . Because the house keys were taken , she and her 3-year-old son , DeVon , moved out of her own home and close to the aunt 's home . <p> " It changed my whole world , the way I feel about people , " she says . DeVon clutches her sometimes , saying , " I do n't want mommy to be sad . I 'll take care of you . " <p> Death in the family <p> Jaime Moreno was 26 - like Ronald Goldman - when he died in the climax to a long-standing battle between in-laws . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> It started when his wife , Vickie , left a party to visit her sister , Paula . Vickie had n't seen Paula in months because her family had a bitter relationship with her sister 's husband , Lorenzo Fernandez . But she had been told he would n't be home . <p> Leaving Jaime at the party , Vickie drove to her sister 's house . When she knocked , Lorenzo Fernandez surprised her by answering the door . Ultimately , a fight broke out between Vickie , Fernandez and his sister . They punched , kicked and scratched while Paula tried to intervene . <p> Vickie raced back to the party and returned to the Fernandez home with a furious and unarmed Jaime . Investigators say Jaime was forcing his way in when Fernandez stabbed him to death . He left two children , ages 7 and 3 . <p> Investigators and the district attorney 's office labeled it justifiable homicide ; Fernandez was never charged with a crime . They blame Vickie Moreno . <p> " Her husband would be alive today if her temper had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigator Pamela Schrick . " She should have backed off . " <p> Vickie does live with that guilt . But Jaime 's parents say investigators have the story wrong , that an unarmed Jaime simply wanted a " fair fight " outside , that the use of a knife in a family quarrel was completely unnecessary . <p> They say Jaime was victimized by a snap decision from investigators , that at least six witnesses could contradict the official conclusion and that Paula is an abused wife who kept quiet out of fear of Fernandez . <p> " It 's outrageous , " says Jaime 's stepfather , Don Monroe , who owns a scrap metal yard . <p> " There was no investigation . They did what I call a 10-minute study ( and ) twisted it all around . . . . At least the system spent some resources on making the Browns and Goldmans feel better . They can put it to rest . " <p> Victim of a stray <p> By all accounts , Cynthia Siegfried died from a bullet that was not meant for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a friend , Shirley Knocke , through the South Coast community of Lomita at 1 : 30 a.m. that Sunday when Knocke stopped by the home of her estranged husband , Mike . <p> The Knockes began arguing on the front lawn while Siegfried sat in the car . Mike Knocke produced a rifle , and shots rang out . According to both Knockes , he was shooting in the air . When Shirley Knocke grabbed for the rifle , it sent a bullet into Siegfried 's chest . <p> She died the way police believe Goldman died - by being in the wrong place at the wrong time . <p> Authorities allowed Mike Knocke to plead guilty to manslaughter . Because of a previous robbery conviction , he drew a 17-year prison term . <p> But the victim 's mother , Martha Siegfried of Torrance , and sister , Donna Eastep , of Reno , Nev. , are n't satisfied . <p> " This should have been a murder case , " says Eastep . " He was intending to kill his wife and missed . " She thinks Shirley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had placed her children in foster care , was in a drug recovery program and had found religion . " My sister was on the road to recovery , building a new life , " says Eastep . <p> Siegfried was buried in an unmarked grave near a row of warehouses in a remote corner of Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City . The family still owes $ 540 for the burial . <p> The mother ca n't set aside the tragedy . " You never get over something like this . I do n't think I 'll ever recover . " <p> And the sister deals with a double tragedy . The state turned down her effort to adopt Siegfried 's children because she did n't make enough money . They 're still in foster care . <p> " It breaks my heart . . . . When Mike Knocke murdered my sister , he shot a hole through our family . " <p> Jealousy erupts <p> Trinidad Velasquez 's death is another sad tale . <p> A year earlier , Velasquez had met a man named Zenaido Gutierrez @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - he called him a drug user - Velasquez and Gutierrez began seeing each other . <p> She became pregnant in December , and they were married in April . There was trouble between them . They fought regularly . Gutierrez was jealous and beat her . <p> Then came the nightmare . A week before her death , when she was five months pregnant , Velasquez went into labor and delivered a baby girl , who died within hours . Velasquez could n't afford a funeral ; her daughter was cremated . <p> Velasquez 's sister , Catalina , lived across the street and the two of them spent most of the next week together there . Velasquez was there June 12 when she decided to go home for a change of clothes . Catalina 's roommate , Irene Aragon , tagged along . <p> Aragon says Gutierrez , angry that his wife wore revealing shorts , picked a fight with her . As Aragon watched , he beat Velasquez and slammed a door on her hand , severing a finger . He knocked her unconscious . Dragging her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her face . <p> Velasquez screamed for Aragon to find her brother . As Aragon left , she heard a shot followed by shrieks from Velasquez : " No mas ! No mas ! " Then two more shots , and silence . Gutierrez drove off as Aragon raced screaming for Catalina . <p> " When I got over there , " says Catalina , " she was lying face down and groaning . I lifted her up , and she had three bullet holes in her face . My breath stopped . She was trying to speak . " Moments later , Velasquez died in Catalina 's arms . <p> Police issued a bulletin on Gutierrez . His 1990 Firebird was found abandoned the next morning in nearby Azusa , but there 's been no sign of him since . <p> As in every other case , the family feels police have done little . " They took a report , and that 's it , " says Catalina . " They do n't care about Hispanic people . " <p> Sgt. Henry Reed of the sheriff 's department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house , he says . They took prints , interviewed every witness , distributed flyers . They 're working with Mexican authorities . <p> " This was no short investigation , " says Reed . <p> But Velasquez 's brother , Pedro , still shares Catalina 's sentiment . " They stopped looking , " says Pedro . " I would tell
