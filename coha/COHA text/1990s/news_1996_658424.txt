<p> The tractor-trailers , cranes , and forklifts have disappeared . And the three heavy-duty vinyl tents stretched over an aluminum frame stand in what once was a student parking lot . <p> In the next two weeks , this high-tech big top will become the world 's largest temporary dining hall for 10,070 athletes - the record-breaking number who will be arriving to compete in the 1996 Centennial Games , July 17 through Aug. 4 . <p> The 80,000-square-foot structure , the largest in a host city where tents are popping up like bubbles at a kid 's birthday party , is located on the Georgia Tech campus in the Olympic Village in downtown Atlanta . <p> The heart of this massive facility is the 25,000-square-foot modular kitchen , which will churn out 50,000 meals a day - including an average of 3,000 to 4,000 box lunches - to the 10,000 athletes and about 5,000 coaches and trainers . <p> The gleaming kitchen , designed by Philadelphia-based Aramark Corp. , the Games ' official food-service manager , seems to stretch from the village to the Olympic stadium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 80-gallon multipurpose kettles , 20 convection ovens , 30 72-cubic-foot refrigerators , and four walk-in refrigerators , each the size of a small house . <p> A fleet of tractor-trailers transported the 13 modular units , each weighing an average of 25,000 pounds , to the site . <p> Jerome Bill , Aramark 's Olympic Village director , says , " This is the biggest modular kitchen ever assembled , and we 'll use every inch of it during 33 days of continuous operation . " <p> Pressing to meet the deadline , a construction crew working seven days a week set the units in place with giant cranes . Mr. Bill says , " Everything fits together like a giant puzzle . " <p> But before construction could begin , crews had to remove curbing , light posts , and surrounding trees , and level out the slope . Larry Asher , Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games assistant program manager for the dining facility , notes , " This site is unique and a lot of things about the construction are new and untried . " <p> Other Olympic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new uses like a federal prison in Lake Placid , N.Y. , and a supermarket in Sarajevo , but this huge stretch of heavy-duty fabric will be used for a month and then torn down in a matter of days . And the site will be returned to a parking lot before Georgia Tech 's fall quarter begins . <p> The fully air-conditioned facility , scheduled to begin serving meals and preparing box lunches July 6 for athletes in training , will be stocked with more than 2.5 million pounds of food . The dining hall , which can seat 3,500 , will be open 24 hours a day so competitors can eat whenever they please . Some athletes , especially those in track and field , are known to start " carbo-loading " at 3 a.m . <p> During peak hours , there will be 14 hot lines and three self-serve islands with drinks , soups , salads , and pastas . But the hot lines can be doubled in a matter of minutes . Marc Bruno , associate Olympic director of Aramark , says , " The serving area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to wait longer than one minute . " <p> To meet the Herculean demands for food production , more than 1,100 workers will staff the kitchen and dining tent . The team of executive chefs and managers come from Aramark , but most of the other employees come from college campuses across the country . <p> For the athletes representing 197 countries , the workers will prepare delectable fare - a far cry from the typical institutional offerings . <p> Athletes at training sites and outlying venues can tote box lunches , each with 12 items ranging from delicacies , such as Pate Forestier , to " high energy " foods such as raisins and snack bars . The hefty lunches , packed and sealed in commemorative containers , include enough goodies for all-day nibbling . <p> The dining-room menu includes 550 dishes , with 75 new recipes for pasta and Southern specialties such as grits , barbecued chicken , and peach cobbler . Senior executive chef Louis Ferretti says , " Most athletes eat everything . " But smoked and dried fish , three kinds of meat , breads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fresh fruit , will be daily staples . <p> The executive chefs and corporate nutritionists selected popular recipes from previous Games , such as Spanish paella , shrimp creole , lasagna , and veal cutlets . They also asked the National Organizing Committee from each country for favorite recipes so athletes would have " a taste of home . " All recipes are tested in Aramark 's kitchen before they become part of the official menu . <p> Cynthia Dexter-Bowen , Aramark 's Olympic Village purchasing director , says , " This is the most traditional menu we 've ever had . We have 50 more recipes than we had in Barcelona . And the menu allows for religious and dietary restrictions . " <p> All food will be labeled in English , French , and Spanish with nutritional information , and pictograms will identify the four basic food groups . " Athletes , " says Ms. Dexter-Bowen , " may not be able to tell the difference between beef bourguignon or stroganoff , but they 'll be able to tell that it 's beef . " A dietician and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nutritional kiosk . <p> Dexter-Bowen says , " Some recipes that work well for six or eight people do n't work well for several thousand athletes . " To take some of the guesswork out of cooking for 15,000 , the staff uses a specially developed computerized system to " explode " the recipes for large groups , maintain quality , and reduce waste . But the final test of what works will take place when all the hungry athletes arrive . <p> * On July 11 , the Monitor will run a follow-up story featuring the Olympic Village 's executive chefs and more recipes . <p> Here are a few dishes athletes will try at the Olympic Village Dining Tent , courtesy of Aramark Corp. : <p> Red Snapper With Vidalia Onion Chutney <p> CHUTNEY : <p> 1/4 cup red wine vinegar <p> 2 tablespoons dark brown sugar <p> 2 tablespoons granulated sugar <p> 1 clove garlic , minced <p> 1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger root <p> 1/2 cup diced tomatoes in juice , drained <p> 1 small Vidalia onion , sliced 1/2-inch thick <p> 1/4 teaspoon salt <p> 1/8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 pounds red snapper , cut into 5-ounce fillets <p> Combine all chutney ingredients except raisins in a large pot .
