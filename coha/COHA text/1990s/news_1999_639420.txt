<p> The 1990s commercialism of public schools has run rampant , sparking concerns that this year prompted a new California law , a hearing in a major Senate committee and a bizarre pairing of conservative and liberal factions . <p> From Channel One to exclusive cola contracts to the ZapMe ! computer program , schools are being pummeled by offers from corporations that want to advertise to the nation 's largest population of spenders . <p> That group of 85 million children , through age 18 , includes 55 million in school . Their spending power and influence are at an all-time high , accounting for $ 24 billion in direct spending each year , plus $ 488 billion - nearly a half trillion - made under their influence , whereby youths nag adults to buy certain products and brand names . <p> Businesses have tremendous success advertising to a captive audience of such spenders . <p> But controversy is hotter than ever as to whether it benefits schoolchildren . <p> Under particular attack are cola contracts , whereby Pepsi-Cola or Coca-Cola promise a school district millions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if a quota in drink sales is met . <p> The corporations defend such practices as providing desperately needed dollars for schools that already sell soft drinks anyway . <p> Dan DeRose , marketing director of DD Marketing Inc. in Pueblo , says such contracts generated more than $ 300 million over the past four years for his company 's clients . <p> ' My basic philosophy : Schools have ( cola ) ; they 're offering it , ' DeRose says . ' If we can assist them in maximizing their revenue then I think we 're doing a great , great service . ' <p> Christine Smith , director of community partnerships and enterprise activity for Denver Public Schools , told the Denver Business Journal last year : ' I got tired of begging for money all the time . ' And DPS signed an exclusive contract with Pepsi-Cola . <p> But do cola contracts really solve a school district 's money woes ? Not in a million years , critics say . <p> A year after Colorado Springs District 11 entered an exclusive Coke contract in 1997 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principals a letter . <p> He urged them to make Coke machines more accessible to students all day , to let students drink vended products all day except during class , and to have teachers consider letting students consume the company 's non-cola beverages , such as juice , tea and water , in classrooms . <p> The district was under pressure to sell at least 70,000 cases of Coke in one of the contract 's first three years . But even if the goal is met , the revenue would equal only $ 32.59 per student - or 1 percent of the district 's budget . <p> Bushey later told The New York Times : ' Quite honestly , they ( Coke ) were smarter than us . ' <p> A cola contract is ' not as sweet as it appears , ' says Barbara Taylor , communications director for Boulder Valley Schools . <p> The schools ' food-service lines have to change their products to use the cola company 's - at the company 's prices . They have to increase the number of pop machines and hire a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boulder Valley turned down Coke and Pepsi , as well as the controversial Channel One commercial television program . <p> The prospect of foisting sugar- and caffeine-laden soft drinks on impressionable , captive children alarms many experts . <p> Childhood obesity has soared 100 percent over the past 20 years , and similarly rising soda-consumption rates - up from 22.4 gallons a year per capita to 56.1 gallons last year - may be to blame , says Richard Troiano , a National Cancer Institute senior scientist . <p> As soda pushes milk out of their diets , girls become more likely candidates for osteoporosis , reports the Center for Science in the Public Interest . <p> But soda contracts also can create credibility problems in schools , notes Andrew Hagelshaw , senior program director for the Oakland-based Center for Commercial-Free Public Education . <p> ' We 're creating a generation of cynics . Are they supposed to believe the teacher , who tells them one thing about good nutrition ? Or the advertiser , who tells them another ? Kids are smart enough to realize , in many cases , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' <p> Perhaps the heaviest artillery lodged now against school commercialism is aimed at Channel One , a 12-minute news program with two minutes of commercials . <p> The Jefferson County school district , Colorado 's largest , rejected Channel One as providing not the best use of educational time and imposing on a captive audience . ( The district since has entered into a contract with Pepsi and US West , however , to finance a sports stadium . ) <p> With 8 million kids tuning in , Channel One can survive without Jeffco . Whether it can survive national politics is another question . <p> On May 20 , the Senate 's Committee on Health , Education , Labor and Pensions held a hearing at the behest of Sen. Richard Shelby , R-Ala. , the Eagle Forum , Focus on the Family and the American Family Association , as well as Ralph Nader 's Commercial Alert and media critics such as Roy Fox of the University of Missouri and Mark Crispin Miller of New York University . <p> Conservatives attacked the broadcast 's <p> cultural content ; liberals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exploiting of public resources for private gain . <p> Channel One , surely stretching its point , responded : ' In the aftermath of senseless tragedies like Littleton , there has never been a time when children needed more to be taught the values of faith and family . That 's why Channel One is bringing hope and common sense into thousands of schools . ' <p> But Shelby now is drafting legislation that would examine the prevalence and effect of commercialism in schools and would prohibit the use of federal funds in allowing third parties to monitor , gather or obtain information from students for commercial purposes . <p> On June 16 , the Southern Baptist Convention adopted a resolution calling for schools to drop Channel One . <p> And in September , the second annual exhaustive study - ' Cashing in on Kids ' - was released by the Center for the Analysis of Commercialism in Education , based at the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee . <p> The researchers found that Channel One 's average annual cost per pupil is $ 229 - or about $ 1.8 billion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed legislation in September to ban any materials with ' unnecessary exposure ' to a commercial brand name , product or logo . <p> That move came in response to a new McGraw-Hill textbook , ' Mathematics : Applications and Connections , ' which is riddled with commercialism . <p> In one example , the book asks : ' Will is saving his allowance to buy a pair of Nike shoes that cost $ 68.25 . If Will earns $ 3.25 per week , how many weeks will Will need to save ? ' <p> Other problems use McDonald 's , M &Ms; or Oreo cookies as subjects . But McGraw-Hill insists it was only pursuing relevancy and received no payments from those companies . <p> The newest commercial offering is ZapMe ! , an Internet program with a rolling banner of advertising posted in the lower left-land corner of the computer screen . A kid can click on the icon to see more of the advertisement - or try to ignore it . <p> ZapMe ! gives high schools a computer lab with 15 terminals , a server and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program . It provides Internet educational tools but ' keeps kids out of the crap . ' <p> That all depends , of course , on how one defines ' crap . ' And such definitions vary widely , from Colorado Springs to Boulder and from coast to coast . <p> For many schools hungry for dollars , commercialism is tempting . But , says Hagelshaw , ' It 's a myth that commercialism might solve that financial problem . Commercialism in schools amounts to a drop in the bucket ; it 's like spitting in the ocean . ' <p> It is n't any droplet for advertisers , however . ' It does n't get any better , ' says James Twitchell , author of ADCULT USA . ' These people ( students ) have not bought cars . They have not chosen the kind of toothpaste they will use . This audience is Valhalla . ' <p> Thus advertisers generate not only vast immediate revenues , but also lifelong brand loyalty among the newest generation of consumers . <p> Yet some companies do n't enter into education for profit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has more than 50 sponsors and offers inner-city algebra tutoring in 22 school systems . None of the sponsors show logos ; they get a mere mention in the footnotes of the materials . <p> This is the type of contribution made in the good old days , when businesses wanted recognition as good corporate citizens . These days , critics lament , corporations are n't trying to solve the problem ; they 're taking advantage of it . <p> Colorado , which ranks 36th or 49th lowest in school financing , depending on whose statistics you believe , has a dire need for more money for schools . <p> Gov . Bill Owens recommends an extra $ 205 million be given to schools in next year 's $ 9.8 billion state budget . That 's an important first step . <p> Citizens often are loath to support bond issues and property-tax increases for schools that are signing what , at first blush , appear to be lucrative contracts with cola companies . <p> And businesses are reluctant to contribute huge sums to schools for similar reasons - and because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profiting off schools . <p> Until more money comes rolling in , the academic needs of students can not be adequately met . <p> But that does n't give school officials a green light to sign any contract waved in their faces . Very , very few administrators understand all the ramifications of such agreements . So it is crucial that , working in concert with parents , teachers and students , they draft policies that will prepare them for how to respond when the deal brokers approach . <p> What materials are acceptable , whether educators should help develop the product , whether the program is consistent with district values and goals , all of these issues should be hammered out by those who have the students ' best interests at heart . <p> ' The guiding things are to remember that kids are primarily in school to learn , not to become consumers . Businesses who approach schools to better the educational experience , looking for some kind of recognition , are very different from businesses who approach schools with the profit motive , ' says David Walsh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Selling Out America 's Children . ' <p> Hagelshaw asks , ' How are we going to treat our students ? As a precious resource to be educated at all costs ? Or as something that can be bought and sold ? ' <p> The taxpayers of America are paying for public schools , and the children of America are sent there to learn . The choices of what we are willing to let them learn will reflect on this society for decades to come . <p> Such choices must be made by those whose primary interest is the students , not the profits . <p> City draws corporate policy line <p> Editor 's note : The following is Milwaukee 's policy for corporate involvement in public schools . <p> This policy was drafted by educators meeting in 1990 at the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee . It has been endorsed by national education groups and 10 state education superintendents . <p> Corporate involvement shall not require students to observe , listen to or read commercial advertising . <p> Selling or providing access to a captive audience in the classroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public trust . <p> Since school property and time are publicly funded , selling or providing free access to advertising on school property outside the classroom involves ethical and legal issues that must be addressed . <p> Corporate involvement must support the goals and objectives of the schools . Curriculum and instruction are within the purview of educators . <p> Programs of corporate involvement must be structured to meet an identified education need , not a commercial motive , and must be evaluated for educational effectiveness by the school or district on an ongoing basis . <p> Schools and educators should hold sponsored and donated materials to the same standards used for the selection and purchase of curriculum materials . <p> Corporate involvement programs should not limit the discretion of schools and teachers in the use of sponsored materials . <p> Sponsor recognition and corporate logos should be for identification rather than commercial purposes . <p> Source : Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development @p#
