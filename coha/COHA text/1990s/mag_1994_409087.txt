In past generations , a person could expect to eat roughly the same foods , cooked the same way , as their parents had , and their parents before them . Today , that is no longer the case . As with the rest of our lives , the world of food is constantly changing . New technologies are enhancing food and quickening its distribution , while different cultures are continuing to bring their own unique tastes into the mainstream . Many changes are occurring in the world of food , and there are many still to come . From eating healthier to combining different styles of food , it is obvious that it 's not just hot dogs and apple pie any more . THE FOOD-HEALTH CONNECTION One of the most exciting topics concerning the future of food is the link being made between food and health in the minds of consumers . This is part of a larger paradigm shift from the old focus on curing the disease to the new focus on preventing disease . People are increasingly reforming ( or talking about reforming ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We saw this clearly illustrated by the oat-bran craze . Granted , some people drank oat-bran beer and ate butter-filled oat-bran muffins , thinking they 'd avoid a heart attack , but they had gotten the message nonetheless . Slowly , the public is getting the message . Food is being divided up into two camps : good and bad . Bread , beans , olive oil , and broccoli are good for us . Butter , beef , cheese , and dessert are bad for us . Generally , the focus is on avoidance of fat and cholesterol , although that may change as scientists learn more about how nutrients in certain foods actually act as cancer fighters and life extenders . But not everyone is equally interested in health . In fact , all this news and excitement about healthy eating has created a lot of confusion . As a result , consumers have varying levels of interest in healthy diets . While most people have accepted the idea that an excess of fat and cholesterol can shorten life , many people are still skeptical about the idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vitamin C , can actually prevent or heal disease and thus extend life . For believers , though , there are books like Prescription for Longevity and The Long Life Cookbook that tell consumers what foods to eat and avoid to enhance their life-spans . The food industry is starting to move into the " functional food " frontier . Products like calcium-fortified fruit juices , Heartwise breakfast cereal , and Total breakfast cereal with betacarotene are just the beginning in a long line of foods being formulated for special health results . Functional foods , consumed specifically to enhance bodily functions , will gain market share in the years ahead . Sometimes referred to as pharmafoodicals or nutraceuticals , functional foods are formulated to enhance thinking or athletic performance , prevent cancer , alter one 's mood , or even improve one 's sex drive . Japan , in fact , already has regulations for such foods , though the U.S. Food and Drug Administration does not yet recognize such claims in foods . Despite all the empirical , rational evidence about the benefits of avoiding fat and consuming fiber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the focus on healthy eating . Magazine and newspaper editors are now telling their readers to stop obsessing about health . Recently , a book called The Bad For You Cookbook was published as a reaction to all of the healthy-eating cookbooks that hit the marketplace , introducing consumers to " corpulent cuisine . " Because certain foods are so closely tied to our individual cultures , there will always be things we will eat despite the evidence against them . What we hope for in the future is to strike a balance between the two extremes : We will always eat the foods needed to be healthy but can still enjoy foods that are less nutritionally beneficial for our bodies . FOOD FRIGHT Consumers are concerned not just about the nutritional aspects of the foods they eat , but also about the safety of their food supply . Every month or so , the media serve up a new food scare for consumers to chew over . Furthermore , there are plenty of articles and books bashing new and unfamiliar technologies . In the past few years alone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions about irradiation and biotechnology , cases of food poisoning at fast-food chains like Jack-in-the-Box , and people finding syringes in cans of Pepsi  --  that have undermined the public 's faith in the people who bring food to them . It 's not just the media 's fault . A lack of communication from the food industry in these scares has left the stage wide open for food activists to present their own versions of the story . People naturally resist change , and when a lack of information is coupled with a lack of regulation , there 's bound to be a backlash . To some extent , food-safety scares are necessary and will probably continue to be the only way to spark efforts to improve conditions . The use of food-related technologies such as biotech and irradiation will come down to a matter of need . If these methods successfully fulfill a need for the consumer , they will be utilized and accepted . Even though such advances as food engineered through biotechnology may be an inevitable and vital part of the consumer 's life in the future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and application for years . Thousands of chefs have already announced that they will not use any biotech foods that enter the marketplace , even though they 've never tasted these foods or learned how they were developed . It 's going to take a lot of time to change people 's minds . CAUSE CUISINE Just as people are more concerned about what they put into their bodies , they are also more interested in the companies that are selling or preparing the foods they consume . Whereas we used to be concerned about quality , we now take quality as a given in an increasingly competitive and responsive marketplace . What we want now is to support companies with integrity and a human touch . No longer can a company dump waste or kill trees and expect to be successful in the long term . More and more consumers are now considering the source and production method used in the food they buy , asking whether the packaging is recyclable or composed of recycled material , whether the manufacturer tests on animals or exploits its workers , and whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , McDonald 's has made an attempt to clean up its environmental act by using recyclable wrappers and containers . Hundreds of restaurants now serve organic fruits and vegetables , return packaging materials to suppliers , or participate in charity functions like Share Our Strength , Meals on Wheels , and others . Packaged-goods companies have jumped on the bandwagon as well . The now-independent " 1% for Peace " program was begun by Ben &; Jerry 's Ice Cream and donated a portion of its profits to peace-oriented groups . Actor Paul Newman donates 100% of proceeds from the sale of his spaghetti sauce , lemonade , and other products to charities . There is a line of products in some markets called " Share , " which contributes to organizations that help the homeless . And finally , there are a lot of products that have sprung up that not only use fruits and nuts from tropical rain forests , but also donate profits to groups working toward preserving rain forests . This " cause cuisine " phenomenon was practically nonexistent just 10 years ago . In the future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the causes they support , but for the way they treat their workers , the environment , and the surrounding community . Businesses will still have to be wary of the bottom line and profitability , but causes will be an essential public-relations expense for most companies . EATING ON THE RUN The ultimate luxury for consumers today is not champagne and caviar , or even money . The one thing that no one can get enough of is time . Everyone is always looking for ways to save time with microwave ovens , home delivery , express lanes , automatic teller machines , supersonic jets , and so on . While some people actually have good reason to be in a hurry , many others have simply conditioned themselves to think that way . One result is that the traditional three-square-meals-a-day regimen is going by the wayside . Many people skip breakfast , or even lunch , catching snacks here and there to survive . One survey shows that 10% of people eat lunch in their cars on a regular basis . Fewer people are taking the time to sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are spreading their meals throughout the day , having a dough nut or bagel at midmorning and chips , fruit , or a candy bar in the afternoon to keep them going . Whether you call it grazing , mouth surfing , or refueling , it 's evolving as a result of our dual-income , fast-paced lifestyles . In the future , this grazing phenomenon will be formalized into a recognized pattern of five meals a day . Not only does " five a day " better fit our living habits , but scientific studies show that an increased number of smaller meals is actually healthier for people . Vending-machine companies , takeout services , and grocery stores will support this trend by making convenience foods healthier and healthy foods more convenient . ALTERNATIVE SHOPPING Another concept coming to the forefront is the purchasing of food at " alternative " locations . Decades ago , there were basically two places to purchase food : restaurants and grocery stores . Now , consumers have an increasing variety of options open to them for meeting their growing needs for convenience and value . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sam 's Wholesale Club or Price Club , have become popular places to buy food and other items in bulk at lower prices . And the traditional food outlets are restructuring themselves to attract consumers . Convenience stores have moved from offering just snacks like soda and cookies to full meals . Fast-food outlets are opening up in supermarkets . Supermarkets themselves have opened huge service and self-serve delis , offering fresh baked goods and prepared food items . Restaurants are offering more home delivery and takeout . Vending machines offer an increasingly varied menu of shelf-stable , refrigerated , and frozen foods . Some companies are even taking grocery orders from computers and delivering the goods to people 's homes . It probably wo n't be too many years before we can shop for groceries and dinners by using our television sets . People hate to shop for food , and studies show that they like it less every day . It 's boring , it 's routine , and it 's often inconvenient . That 's why so many alternatives are being sought . Theoretically , we could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar to the Jetsons . Few people now grow their own food ; in the future , fewer and fewer people will even want to prepare it . Yet , we still have a cultural tie to food and the preparation process . That 's why , despite the time crunch and availability of convenience foods , there is a resurgence of cooking classes and interest in weekend " hobby " cooking . So , while we may be raising a generation of cooking illiterates , our desire to prepare our own foods will not go away altogether . Therefore , the mix of buying prepared foods and staple goods will not go away . But in the future , the staple items that require no imagination  --  like milk , detergent , bread , and peanut butter  --  will be automatically delivered to our homes , thus minimizing the boredom and frustration of shopping . SHOP-O-TAINMENT When it comes to shopping for meals and less-routine items , the food industry will provide consumers with a pleasurable experience called " shop-o-tainment . " Fun is a growing phenomenon in retailing : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next to Caesar 's Palace in Las Vegas . Shoppers are taken into a whole new world where they are entertained while they spend . Now , supermarkets , such as Metro Food Markets in Maryland , are catching on to people 's desire for shopping to be more fun . Items are displayed creatively , and something new is always being featured . People do n't mind shopping when it 's fun , and they drive from miles around to do it . Restaurants like Lettuce Entertain You , Scoozi , Tucci Milan , Foodlife , Hat Dance , R.T . Grunts , and Papagus all provide a unique atmosphere reminiscent of other countries , times , or even complete fantasy places . Other restaurants offer entertainment by putting their kitchens on display and providing a bar around it where people can sit and watch the fun . CUISINE FUSION In much the same way that broccoli and cauliflower can be combined to make a new vegetable called brocolflower , so can different cuisines be combined . Cuisine fusion  --  also called cross-cultural cooking or culinary hybridization  --  involves the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are indigenous to particular countries . From this , you can get combinations such as Eurasian , Chinese-Cuban , Japanese-French , Mexitalian , and others . The primary factors driving this trend are increased travel abroad , which exposes people to new foods ; new immigrants , who often open restaurants in their new host country ; and the rise of celebrity chefs who know enough about different techniques to create new foods . Though many new food inventions originate from chefs in upscale restaurants , there are plenty of examples of cuisine fusion on a less-lofty level , including chicken fajita pitas , pizza-filled egg rolls , croissant sandwiches , and many others . Food is one of the easiest and least-threatening ways to learn about another culture . It requires no language training , religious practices , or other special skills to partake in , and it is a two-way sharing process .
