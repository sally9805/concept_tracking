If the gulf war spectacular had been a movie , the credits could have listed Jimmy Carter as a progenitor of the Tomahawk cruise missile and Ronald Reagan as merchant prince of the huge weapons inventory that crushed the evil foe . But the fellow who may actually have had more to do with authoring the success story is never mentioned : Jerry Ford . <P> Jerry Ford ? Correct . As might be expected , given his postpresidential flight paths , the former Commander in Chief hauled his golf clubs to the salubrious environs of Rancho Mirage , Calif. , during the crisis . But Ford , like other Americans , lingered in front of the TV screen as the war unfolded . He was also watching his boys perform back in Washington . " They did a terrific job , " boasted Ford . <P> Of the eight men in George Bush 's war council , four were brought in directly or shoved along in their journey by Ford . Two others arrived at the fringes of power during Ford 's brief tenure , and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helped nurture . <P> " I think I had a knack of picking good people , " said Ford last week . To start at the apex of what some are calling a " presidential culture " : Ford first spotted George Bush in 1966 . Ford , then House minority leader , recalls that Bush was a " bright star " running for Congress in Texas . He hurried down to campaign for him , then helped put Bush on the powerful Ways and Means Committee . As President , Ford made Bush U.S. representative to China and later named him to head the CIA . <P> When he was Vice President , Ford had got to know Lieut . General Brent Scowcroft , deputy head of the National Security Council . In those days Henry Kissinger was not only Secretary of State but also National Security Adviser . Ford did not like the double duty for Kissinger . He did like Scowcroft . As President , Ford in 1975 gave Scowcroft the NSC title and turned the self- effacing general into a recognized player in vital deliberations . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scowcroft back in the job Ford had given him 13 years earlier . <P> When Ford shuffled his Cabinet , he named a promising but largely unknown 34- year-old as the new White House chief of staff : Dick Cheney . After Ford lost the 1976 election , Cheney decided to run for Congress in his home state of Wyoming . Ford 's political instincts stirred again . " I went right out to campaign for him , " he says . Cheney won and became a respected and powerful Congressman  --  until Bush made him Secretary of Defense . <P> Ford 's White House antennas had picked up good signals in 1976 about the Commerce Department 's No. 2 man , James Baker . Ford tapped him to hunt delegates at the 1976 Republican Convention , then elevated him to national prominence as his campaign manager . Despite the Republican loss that year , Baker continued to rise , serving first in Reagan 's Cabinet and then as Secretary of State for his friend Bush . <P> Colin Powell , current Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly touched by Ford , but his special brotherhood took them in as they moved through the Reagan years . Of the six men named above , one is President , and three others  --  Baker , Cheney and Powell  --  are possible successors to Bush . If that does not quite constitute a presidential culture , it stands as an impressive legacy from a man we sometimes forget , Jerry Ford .
