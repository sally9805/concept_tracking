U.S. policymakers are betting that the latest saber rattling from Beijing , which includes veiled threats of military action against Taiwan delivered to U.S. think tanks and other outside China watchers , is an effort to pressure Washington to lean harder on Taiwan President LEE TENG-HUI . <P> Infuriated by Lee 's abandonment last month of the " one China " principle , China has been flooding pro-Beijing papers in Hong Kong with scare stories , as well as filling the skies over the Taiwan Strait with warplanes , in part to send a message to Taiwan 's voters who will choose Lee 's successor next year . The experts do n't discount the risk that this psychological warfare could by accident erupt into the real thing , but figure Beijing has too much at stake right now , including an upcoming Clinton-Jiang meeting and a long-sought deal to get into the World Trade Organization . Moreover , an international outcry over use of force would spoil the People 's Republic of China 's big 50th-birthday party on Oct. 1 . <P>  --  By Jay Branegan/Washington   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
