<p> Jan van Breda Kolff tried to go cold turkey once . He lived without basketball for six months . <p> He tried this despite being raised as the only son of a nomadic coach who guided some of the game 's greatest players . He tried it after a college career at Vanderbilt where he was 1974 player of the year in the Southeastern Conference . He tried it after playing 11 years professionally - nine in the ABA and NBA , two in Italy as player-coach . <p> When the glitter of the pro career faded in 1985 , van Breda Kolff got a normal 9-to-5 job at a bank . That ended soon after he decided to use his spare time as a volunteer assistant at Princeton under coach Pete Carril . <p> Princeton was where Jan became a gym rat when his father , Butch , was the coach . <p> " " At our first game of the season , I had that familiar nervousness sitting there on the bench and the adrenalin rush and the thrill of winning a close game , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the camaraderie , the competitive juices that flow . I realized this is what I 'd done all my life . It 's what I was comfortable with . After the game , I went home and told my wife Betty I wanted to coach . " <p> That night , a banker cashed in his chips . <p> Jan van Breda Kolff realized he was the last to know what others around him knew all along - he was a natural-born coach . <p> At 41 , he 's at Vanderbilt and the idea of coaching at his alma mater still seems deliciously incredible . He 's had a meteoric rise through the ranks - five seasons as an assistant to Carril , then two as head coach at Cornell . He had 23-29 record , including 16-10 last season against a schedule that included five top 20 teams . <p> The deal at Vanderbilt came quickly . One moment , van Breda Kolff was advising Cornell players about offseason training programs . The next moment , Eddie Fogler was resigning in a huff and going to South Carolina , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extension soon enough . <p> Soon , there was van Breda Kolff interviewing twice with Vandy , getting the job and shopping for a house . <p> He shakes his head . <p> He remembers when he was a gangly , long-haired 6-8 point guard-center summoned to the office of coach Roy Skinner . <p> " " It never hit me when I was 18 or 19 years old that I 'd be on this side of the desk talking to players , " said van Breda Kolff , the father of two teen-age basketball-loving sons . <p> " " Once I decided to go into coaching , I also hoped one day it would be back at Vanderbilt . It 's a great basketball atmosphere . <p> And the type of student-athletes we recruit here are the type I played with and the type I like to recruit . That 's why I chose to work at private universities like Princeton and Cornell . <p> Van Breda Kolff is still trying to catch up with old acquaintances . His years with Denver , Virginia and Kentucky of the ABA and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separated him from what was a close-knit group of college teammates . <p> His lone link to Vanderbilt while he played pro ball was Ron Bargatze , the coach who recruited him . <p> The recruiting process was a fluke , Bargatze had always wanted to see Disneyland , so he began subscribing to the Los Angeles Times to see if there were any area players he could recruit . He read that Palos Verdes High had top talent , so he made a recruiting trip . He was looking at others when he noticed van Breda Kolff . <p> " " I told Jan we 'd like to have him at Vanderbilt , " said Bargatze , now an analyst for Vandy basketball broadcasts . " " He told me that Bill Bradley , who played for Jan 's dad at Princeton , had also considered Vanderbilt . He said , " If Vandy was good enough for Bill Bradley , it 's good enough for me . ' " <p> Bargatze closed the deal by telling van Breda Kolff he could be part of one of the tallest backcourts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lee Fowler , a 6-6 guard from Columbia , Tenn. , now assistant athletic director at Memphis State . <p> It did n't take Fowler and the Commodores long to realize who was the leader and who were the followers . As Bargatze said , " " If someone told a joke , they would look at Jan first to see if he was laughing . If he did , they all did . The guy was like a Pied Piper . " <p> For basketball background , Jan hung around his dad 's teams . <p> He had watched Bradley and NBA legends Jerry West . Wilt Chamberlain and Elgin Baylor . That gave him instant credibility with his Vandy teammates . Even the coaches sometimes took his advice . <p> " " In a game at Ole Miss our senior year , we had a 12- to 14-point lead cut to a couple of points and we called a timeout , " Fowler said . " " We get to the huddle and Bargatze says , " Let 's run No. 5 . ' Another assistant , Wayne Dobbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Coach Skinner says , " Let 's decide what we 're going to do . ' " " Then Jan says " Let 's run No. 1 . ' We did what Jan recommended . We scored and we went on to win . It looked like a great strategical coaching move to people who did n't know , but it was Jan who knew what we needed to do . " Even then , van Breda Kolff seemed wise beyond his years . <p> Other players were drawn to him because of his unselfish play . When he won SEC honors on a 23-5 team that shared the league title , he averaged only 10.9 points - and 9.7 rebounds and five assists . <p> He was sensitive to his teammates ' needs . Before senior Tom Arnholt 's final home game in 1972 , van Breda Kolff , a sophomore , called a team meeting without Arnholt . He told the players they would give Arnholt the best game of his career . <p> " " Let 's get him the basketball - let 's give him something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fed Arnholt enough for a career-high 33 points in a 104-82 win over Mississippi State . <p> As a senior , van Breda Kolff almost organized a boycott when Fowler and Bill Ligon missed a curfew and were suspended for a trip to Kentucky and Tennessee . <p> " " We go to the dorm in the bus to pick up the players and no one walks out , " Bargatze said . " " Jan is standing there and he tells me he does n't think the suspensions are right . If there was any problem with the team , he thought he could take care of it . " He 's that way as a coach . Cornell athletic director Laing Kennedy characterized van Breda Kolff 's strength as a problem-solver . <p> " " After every game win or lose , he could tell you why we won or lost , " Kennedy said . <p> His first problem at Vanderbilt was soothing the shocked feelings of players who saw Fogler leave just six days after their loss to Temple in the NCAA West Regional semifinals . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to meet with everyone on the team individually , " said all-SEC guard Billy McCaffrey . <p> " " He wanted to know what we were feeling and that was very important to us . Through the whole coaching switch , the players did n't have any more information than the general public - sometimes we had less information . He gave us a comfort level and allowed us to move on and concentrate on next season . " <p> Van Breda Kolff put his new players at ease when he told them his philosophy . <p> " " I know I 'm more analytical as a coach than I was a player when I played on instincts and just created , " van Breda Kolff said . " " I like to give my players a framework , but also give them the flexibility and freedom of choice . I 'll make gradual changes . <p> What this team does n't need right now is drastic changes - they 've been very successful for the last two or three years . " <p> Carril , one of the basketball 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vanderbilt . <p> " " I knew when he was 11 years old that he was going to be a good coach because he was smart the way he played then , " Carril said . " " He was a great coach for us . The players liked him because he 's a very intimate teacher . " Since van Breda Kolff played professionally - a claim no other coach in the SEC can make - he believes he can attract blue-chip recruits to academically tough Vandy . <p> " " Kids always say they want to go to a place to get an education to have a chance to play professionally , " van Breda Kolff said . " " We have Will Perdue and Jeff Turner in the pros . But I can walk in a recruit 's living room and show I 'm living proof that it can be done from this school .
