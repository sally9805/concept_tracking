WHILE SHE WAS STANDING THERE talking to him she could see herself five minutes from then already down in the street below , taking a cab , riding away in the winter dusk and into the years that would make her forget she was telling her father , " You 're scum to me , " and watching the shock spread over his face . <p> The shock in his face spread over her own . It gave her pleasure to feel his shock , to know she had found the words for it . Like the right key that would throw the lock . She had taken his check and torn it across and dropped it onto the rug at her feet . She felt it drift through the floors she had climbed . Climbed instead of taking the lift because she had waited her life for this and still her anger needed time , a fragment more to be equal to it . <p> After the check had been torn for him , she had seen the white come into his face . It had given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't around when we needed you . My mother d : ed for lack of money to get her the care she should have had . You let her die .

" <p> Then it was finished and she could leave . <p> But the woman came from another room . A wife , had he said ? Another wife . . . with restless hands an . scarlet mouth . She now advanced , reflecting his pain . No , simply determined to reinforce it . It seemed the reason that she was there . " Your father was happy that you , would come . But this is n't coming . It 's worse than if you stayed away . ' <p> While the woman spoke , the girl was lost in seeing her father , a pale and slight , round-shouldered man , with thinning hair , with heavy lines from nose to mouth and eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was formally dressed . But then she too had dressed for him . Her best coat . She had kept it on . Her hair arran ed to show she was not , nor ever had been , something just to be thrown away . He was not at all , not remotely , like the man who had taught her how to salute and polish her shoes , march double time around the yard , who had fought in a war before she was born and caught a bullet in his chest and many years later left a note : " Try to think I never came back . I died over there and that was it . " Left it propped on the countertop between the sugar bowl and salt .... But how could she think he never came back when he had whistled her marching songs , lifted her over the wire fence , pulled her flying across the ditch , slipped a knife through the summer melon and held together the giant halves while she guessed if it would be ripe inside , red enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sweet enough to save the seeds for him to plant the following spring ? He had left her with a pocket of seeds . And after many years had passed , she threw them out with angry tears . <p> She was her mother confronting him . The two of them were confronting him . They had shared him like a common cup , the absent presence they drank each day . Her mother , in dying , bequeathed the dregs : mistrust ... mistrust of any man , and love cast down the lonely well . Inside the well was the cry of a child . Her own cry ? Or the cry of the child she would never have ? <p> A tremor was in the hand that groped for his handkerchief . He wiped his lips . <p> The scarlet mouth had charged again . " Why did you come if this is what you have to say ? " <p> " Because I have waited my lite to say it . " <p> " You can see your father is n't well " <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room to them . Inside the room and all the while she had climbed the stairs , four flights of them , ignoring the lift to give her time to face him with a heart as cold as the street below , she had not foreseen that once she was done , that once outside the room she would break . About her heart the chain was drawn , more tightly drawn than it ever had been . With the pain of it she caught her breath . She shuddered and leaned against the wall . <p> An aging porter with curious eyes passed her by with a luggage cart . His hair was her father 's thinning gray . His sallow cheek was deeply lined , as carefully shaved as her father 's cheek had been for her .... Her own cheek pressed to the wall , she wept . She had always dreamt he would come again and tell her why he had stayed away . She was swept into weakness , only beginning to understand how much she had counted on hearing him say that he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why he could n't . <p> Instead , he was waiting with his check . Things did n't work out was what he said . But now if she needed anything ... " Need ? " she had said , and cried to herself , I need nothing from you but never to see your face again . <p> Drunk with weeping , she plunged along the empty hall , its carpet patterned with crimson roses . She seemed to be wading through pools of roses caught in the lights along the wall , blurred with tears , till she saw them shattered . She did not want the stairs she passed . She wanted the lift that would take her away with all possible speed . His room had cornered the world for her , and there she had fought the abandoned child . But now in the hall , unable to shake herself free of the child , she was conscious of being far from the room she called her home , in a large hotel where she did n't belong . And here she was walking the hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she heard voices , turned into a passage , and lost her way but stumbled on . She turned again . At last at the end of a passage she found it . She pressed a button . Her coat had all but fallen off . She pulled it close about her throat . She wiped her eyes . <p> Almost at once the door flew open . She stepped inside . The cage was small and dimly lit . A heavy man , who stood by the panel , was staring at her tear-stained face . Abruptly he reached to press a button . She dropped her eyes and felt the descent . She tried to make her mind a blank . When she reached the street her life would begin . <p> They swayed to a stop . She waited for the door to open . And when it did not , she turned to the man . He was biting into the peel of an orange . The smell of it was pungent , strong . His teeth were white and small for his face . They dragged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall to his open palm . His eyes seemed never to have left her own . <p> " It 's not too late , " he said to her . He pressed the button . The door flew open . <p> She clutched her purse and stared at him , but she was too spent to feel surprise . She wanted only to leave it all . She stepped out . After the door had closed behind her , she grew aware that the place was wrong . She did not seem to have reached the lobby , or not the one she had seen before . She was standing alone in a narrow hall with rosy tiles beneath her feet . Some twenty feet or so away it fanned into an open space . She took a step . Her heels clicked on the rosy tiles . And still the feel of the place was wrong . <p> Before her was a Persian rug and elegant bleached-wood tables and lamps . Magazines on a center table . A long sofa and easy chairs . A large , bright room of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alcove with a marble bust . Through banks of fern a flash of gold and silver fish . Most strikingly , the far wall was hung with a giant tapestry that showed a unicorn in flight . <p> She came to a halt before the sight . Brilliantly lit were the snow-white wings . The single horn was overlong and tipped with cloud , the base of it bathed in a shaft of light that seemed to spring from the room itself .... <p> She drew her eyes once more to the room . It made her think of an empty stage when the curtain parts . But as she was turning to ring for the lift , as if on cue the players appeared , two shadows against the snow-white wings . They walked to her with measured steps . When they were close , she grew aware of their measured smiles . Smiles with a measured friendliness , ready to be withdrawn at once , but not surprised to find her there just as she was in her navy coat , the dark hair trapped inside the collar  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes still red from all her tears . She pressed the handkerchief to her eyes . They appeared at once to accept the gesture . It seemed in fact to reassure them . Their faces visibly relaxed . Incredibly she felt their welcome . She could not come to terms with it . <p> Except for their smiles they were not alike . One was the taller by a head . Dark and balding , pitch-black eyes that were velvet soft with a glint of cold . The skin of his face was lightly pocked . The shorter was olive , rapier lean , with a restless body and restless gaze . For just a moment she caught the gleam inside the jacket that swung unbuttoned . She knew with a shock he was wearing a gun . She sensed that the other wore one too . The smiles were suddenly gone from them . She was facing men with a secret answer . <p> She began to feel at their mercy then . She allowed herself to be propelled by the taller man , who had grasped her arm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of paintings on either side , of statuary here and there , of marble birds among the ferns , and at the edge of a table they passed a box of chocolates , open , fragrant . The smaller man , without losing step , caught one up and tossed it into his open mouth . He dropped behind , scooped up the box and quickened his pace to offer it . She glanced at it and shook her head . His face was rapt with the pleasure of chewing . It told her nothing . <p> She suddenly halted . " What is this place ? " <p> The one who was chewing waved the question aside . " Meetings , " he said . He seemed to think she would understand . <p> She was trying to mask her deep alarm . " I do n't know who you are , " she said . <p> The taller one relaxed his hold . " Family , " he said , while the other swallowed . <p> She did not move . It was clear she was someone else for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she began , but her voice failed . <p> He looked her over from head to foot . " That 's smart you did n't wear the usual thing . You want a cup of coffee brought ? How you like it , sugar , cream ? " <p> The man who was still chewing his sweet opened a door near the unicorn . The other gently thrust her in . She heard the door click shut behind . Music was playing , soft and live . A tenor voice surrounded her , beseeching her in tones of love . And then it was abruptly gone . <p> She found herself in another room as dimly lit as the one she had left was full of light . She sensed at once that the other room had been but an anteroom to this , that here was the core of whatever world she had stumbled upon . At first she could distinguish little . The room was ominously still except for the gentle tick of a clock . She did not move . She let the shapes emerge for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a little lake of faintest light . She could just make out a bed with covers in disarray . Waves of them that caught the shimmer were tidal pools of the lake of light . The little tick of the faceless clock seemed to surround and define the bed . <p> A man 's voice suddenly spoke a word . It seemed to her like the name " Maria . " The name was breathless but firm , with a question . The voice had in it an edge of age and resignation yet a flutter of stifled anticipation . <p> She was unable to move or speak . <p> After a pause , " Then it 's Leo , " he said in a hinter voice . " is it Leo come to finish me off ? " He coughed once . " You were always one for the dark , boy . Your father 's errands run in the dark . I was there with him when you were born . I did n't like the look of you then . Or later on ... It 's just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark . " <p> A light came on beside the bed , so unexpected it blinded her . Then she saw she was facing a man in bed , his head half-propped among the pillows , the shimmering covers drawn to his chin . Above the covers a gun was pointed straight at her . She saw its gleam in the yellow light . <p> He lifted his head to stare at her . " Marial " he cried . " Oh , God , you camel " His head fell back . He dropped the pistol among the covers . <p> And still she could not move or speak . She held her breath . He seemed to hold his own as well . Only the tick of the clock was live .... A hand was lifted to her and fell . " Come close , " he begged her . " Bedda rniaI " And in his voice was a note she could only describe as joy . " Bedda mia . " He whispered it . " Come close to me . It 's been so long . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she advanced a little into the room . <p> " You came , " he said . " It 's all I care about . You came . " She could see him clearly in the light . He was looking at her with eyes of love , a man who was well into middle age . The dark of his hair was touched with gray . The narrow beard surrounding a delicate pointed chin was wholly gray . The face it framed was small and lean . Pale , intent , a priestly face . " Come close and let me look at you . " <p> She forced herself to approach the bed so that he could see she was not whoever he thought she was , and then perhaps they would Jet her go . <p> " Maria , biddizza . Your mother 's hair . Her great dark eyes . And have they shed some tears for me ? " The voice was resonant , fairly deep , with the trace of an accent , it seemed to her . Each syllable like the tip of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plunged into the next . <p> " I 'm not Maria . " She made her voice sound sure of it . <p> " If you changed your name I can understand . You 're here is all I care about . The little daughter ... the daughter I lost . I lost you in a garden once . " <p> The urgency of it grew in her . " I 'm not your daughter . Look at me . I 'm not Maria . Tell them I 'm not so I can go . " <p> " Go ? " he said . " You want to go ? " " I 'm not your daughter . Look at me . " <p> She felt his eyes take in her face . The clock ticked . His hand groped for the table that held it . His fingers all but tipped the lamp . There was now another source of light . She turned to see on the wall a painting suffused with a richly golden glow . The portrait was of a woman somewhat younger than herself , seated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair and haunted , dark , impassioned eyes . Her shadow lay across a harp . " You see , " he said , " how alike you are . Your mother 's hair . Her beautiful eyes . " <p> The woman she saw was beautiful . Utterly strange and beautiful . Indeed the coloring was her own . More than her mother 's had ever been . " A madonna , " he sighed . " She watches over me when I 'm here . " <p> She heard him , at a loss for words . He said to her in a muffled voice , <p> " She took you away when you were a child . I saw you once come out of school . I made them stop the car and wait . They told me which you were , you know , but I had picked you out myself . You were too small for all those books . I wanted to help you carry them .... But that was a very long time ago .... Have it your way , " he said at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His head relaxed against the pillow . The resonance had left his voice . " I thought . . . but I deserve no less . I think your mother always loved me . In spite of all . She never married ... Why did you come ? " he said to her . <p> She was beginning , " I took the lift ... " <p> He shook his head to stop her words . Over the cover his hand moved down his side and paused . " Before you go ... There 's no one else . " <p> Impatience was conquering her dismay . " I 'm not your daughter . Listen to me . " <p> " Your mother wrote .... She let me pay for some of your things . The hood ... she let me buy the hood . They sent for you because they knew . Because they know you are a nurse . " He stopped and with a shaking hand he threw the covers from his side . The sheet , the bed were soaked with blood . She thought she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed to steady herself . <p> He looked at her with the trace of a smile , as if the blood did not interest him . " You see , " he said , " why you were brought . There was no one else .... These son-in-laws , they trust no one . The Holy Mother they would n't trust . Maria , they said , is one of us . " <p> I 'm not , I 'm not , she wanted to cry . <p> He seemed to hear . " Have it your way . But you have a skill . I need you now ... " His voice went dead . <p> She was staring into the mat of towels about his thigh . She saw him lying fully dressed . The leg of his pants had been cut away and cradled his thigh like a blood-soaked flag . The bed itself was a pool of blood , a purple plum and crimson red . She turned away . The room went dark . She was blind and deaf . She held the bedpost to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her ears . His voice came back from far away . " Stop the blood . It 's all I ask . " <p> Desperation was in her voice . " I do n't know how . I 'm not a nurse . I work in an office . I keep books . " <p> For the first time he seemed to hear . Perhaps the weakness had stilled his protest . The clock was ticking into his silence . She grew aware of something else . Not a sound but a distant pulse . In the mountains in winter when she was a child she had felt such a distant pulse . A gathering fury of plunging snow far away among the peaks . Her father , smiling into her eyes , had whispered to her , " The mountain shrugs when it 's had enough . " In the room upstairs she had wanted to say , You shrugged us off when you had enough . But here the fury was in the train . She had been taken underground where trains whip through the hollowed earth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a humming of strings , a faint and silvery jangle of sounds . She followed his eyes to the glow on the wall . It was as if the harp within the frame were touched She could not believe what she had heard . <p> He reached to shut the picture away , to thrust it back in the shadow again . He drew the covers to his throat and shut his blood away from her . " Who are you , then ? " he said at last . <p> The hum of the strings was in her throat . " Diana Pierce . " " Why are you here ? " <p> " I tried to tell you . I was lost . " <p> " And Dako brought you ? The elevator ? " <p> " Someone did . I lost my way . " <p> The faintest smile was on his lips . " He thought your tears were shed for me . " After a while he spoke again . " You see they were looking for someone else . For one who might be weeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had died away . " When she comes she will know what to do for you . " <p> Across the room the door was opened . A shaft of light was on the bed . In the doorway was a silhouette . " You found the stuff you need in here ? " <p> She made a move to speak to him . But the man on the bed , now starkly visible in the light , had signed her to silence with his lips . The other came forward into the room . He seemed to be the taller one . He smelled of tobacco . <p> " Leave us alone , " said the man in bed in a clear and cold , peremptory voice . <p> The other paused , then turned and left . <p> " You must n't tell them you 're not Maria . " <p> " But why ? " she cried . " If they knew they would find someone else to help . " <p> " They would n't , " he said , " but they would kill you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound of the harp had been to her . " But why ? " she asked . Her voice was stunned . <p> " Because you 've seen me . It is enough . They have big dreams , these son-in-laws with greedy eyes . Big deals to make . They want more time . " <p> At that he seemed to drift away . His eyes closed . His face went gray and fell abruptly to the side . Watching him , she scarcely breathed . She knew the seeping of his blood . <p> " Sir ? " she whispered , leaning to him You can see your father is n't well , the scarlet mouth had said to her . <p> The lamp had yoked them with yellow light . She laid her coat upon the bed and took the lamp-its marble base was a dolphin shape  --  and raised it till the cord was taut . The mirror held her bewildered eyes . It held the box on the dresser top . <p> In a daze she lugged the box to the bed . There were bandages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cotton wool and tape . Scissors , jars , a small basin . She was at a loss before them . <p> Biting her lip to keep from shrinking , gently she drew the covers to reveal again his blood . She forced herself to see that the pool of it had spread . She moved the table with the lamp as close as the cord allowed . There . glistened below her now a crimson lake . She closed her eyes to pray . Then tentatively she pulled at the towels about his thigh . She held her breath against their warm and secret smell . She slid them into the basin . The wound she saw was gorged . With a square of gauze and water from a drinking glass beside the lamp , she began to wash away the blood . Suddenly it surged beneath her hand . She dropped the gauze in panic . With shaking hands she fell to tearing open pack after pack of it to heap upon the wound . The man was still as death , his face now white above the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and circled his thigh , over and over winding it , afraid to stop . His flesh against her fingertips was burning hot . She heard her sobs . <p> He must have heard them too . She found his eyes upon her . " Bedda rnia , " he whispered to her . " I never dreamt it would be this way . I dreamt of finding you and begging a long forgiveness . " His eyes were burning into hers . " I ask it now . Forgive me , biddizza . " <p> She could not bring herself to speak until she covered his wound . " Are you in pain ? " <p> He shook his head . " Your hand has healing in it .... She let me buy your hood . Your mother let me buy your hood . I wish you 'd worn it here today . " He closed his eyes as if to sleep . " I ask it now . Forgive me . " <p> She shut herself against the echo . She turned her face away . " So hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " For what ? " she asked . <p> " For what ? " he echoed her . His voice was faint but touched with wonder . " You do n't remember ? Then I thank the Holy Mother ... " <p> She could not understand his words or why she wanted to weep . <p> " You remember a little , is it so ? " <p> " No , " she said with effort . " I do n't remember . I 'm not your daughter . " <p> " You are , " he said with passion , " and nothing can ever change itl Not even the scene in the garden can change it . She could n't forgive me that , your mother . She took you away . She took you from me the following day . " <p> His cheek was flushed as if with health . Gently again she raised the covers . Blood had pierced the layers of gauze . She stifled her cry . " You 're bleeding . Tell me what to do . " <p> He did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his chest . She saw him fully , finely dressed . She brought herself to loosen his tie , a figured silk , undo a button beneath the beard . The throat was corded , deeply hollowed . There were delicate lines about his eyes . The nose was aquiline and strong . A handsome , aging face , with muscles tight about the mouth , yet something generous in the lips . But force of habit turned her ace from that of any man and now from his . She began to tug at the jacket , but lest she make his bleeding worse she gave it up . She placed his hands beneath the covers . One bore a curious , glistening ring of green and gold . <p> She said to him , " What happened to you ? " <p> But he was caught up in the past . His eyes were burdened with memory . " The garden . It was early June . And morning . Was it morning ? " <p> She shook her head . <p> He closed his eyes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent his errand boy over the wall . He thought I was moving in on him .... " He stirred beneath the covers . " What does it matter now ? Can you remember Rico ? He would hold you on the pony , round and round the garden ... Rico was there and shot him from the end of the path . The spray of it went into the roses . " <p> He opened his eyes . They were bright with ever . " You remember that ? " <p> He drew her into something she had no strength for knowing . She shut herself away . <p> But he was saying , " You were only three . You never looked at the man on the path . You never looked at the dying there . You broke away from your mother 's hand and ran to the roses the gun had shattered . You tried to put them together again , " <p> The horror of it was in his face . <p> " You must n't talk . " Her voice broke , <p> " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your little hands on your dress ... and on your hair . " <p> She would not listen . She turned away . She said , " This has nothing to do with me . " <p> " And on your mother 's face and hair ... She took you away from me ... and from this life ... before you could know any more of it . I never meant it to happen , " he said . " I wanted you to be safe from it . I wanted beautiful things for you . " <p> She turned to him . <p> " Forgive , bedda mia . Say it to me . " <p> She could not speak . He raised his head , which she tried to lower . " You must lie still . " She was helpless against his fevered strength . Her tears had welled from her despair . " Say it to me . " " I do , " she said . <p> His head fell back . He seemed to sleep . <p> Her eyes were streaming . She could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than fear . They seemed to come from someone else . From a life that was not her own to live . Yet from a place where she had been . She turned and circled the shadowed room . She was stumbling down the hall upstairs , lost , unable to find the lift .... But now there was blood upon her hands . She could not live with the feel of it . She came upon the bathroom door . As her groping fingers found the switch , she shut her eyes to the burst of light and held them shut while she washed her hands with a soap that smelled of lavender . Her face in the glass , when she opened them , was staring back and marked with blood . She plunged it into the running water and reit the wet upon her throat and down her breast and in her hair . <p> She could not bear to return to him . Over and over she bathed her face . At last she straightened and dried herselL By the bathroom light the room was visible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room had seemed to her . A small piano . A wall of books . A Chinese screen with flowers and birds . Porcelain figures here and there , the largest one of a woman and child . A glint of strings from a golden harp . And yes , the girl who was not her mother just discernible on the walI . The girl who had posed with a golden harp , perhaps the one in the corner there . <p> Slipping into the shadowed room , she shut the door on all but a blade-sharp slice of light that escaped below . She began once more to pace the room , avoiding the bed and its circle of light . A scent of leather was in the air , and then a trace of sandalwood . The fold of a drapery brushed her hand . She drew it aside to reveal a window , which instantly she struggled to lift . A glow from a street lamp , perhaps the moon , was frosting bars with an eerie light . Beyond the bars she could see the wall . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was the little girl locked in her room to study her sins , afraid of tigers under the bed , begging her father to change her sentence to double time around the yard , as he had before ... <p> Instantly the door was opened . A darkened figure was in the light . " What is it ? " he said , advancing to her . She saw that he was the shorter one . He stopped and then approached the bed . His eyes slid over its occupant and came to rest on the blade of light at the bathroom door . " What was the noise ? " His voice was low . Alarm was in it . Suspicion of her . <p> " The window , " she said . " I tried to raise it . " Seeing his face , she added at once , " To freshen the air . " <p> He stared at her . " There 's not any need .

Your sister . You 're family , " he said . " Remember that . " She could not take her eyes from the gun . " You want some food ? " he said at last . " It comes from the dining room upstairs . Top notch . Anything you want I tell them to fix . You think he can eat ? " <p> She shook her head . <p> " I tell them to fix you something good . You like Italian ?

" You 're not someone I 'm supposed to know ? " <p> She shook her head . <p> He looked away . " Maria never came , " he said . <p> " I do n't know . " <p> " If she comes they will kill you . That is a fact . Never tell them you 're not Maria . " <p> She heard him with a distant shock , like the thud of the window against the sill . " Is she going to come ? " <p> He closed his eyes .

But after a while he said with an effort . " This is my cave ... I call it my cave . I am safe from the friends who want what I have . I listen to music and live in peace . The train comes and I hear her play . Did you hear it then , the harp sound when the train is here ? I am in the ground . It is like my tomb ... " He paused for a while . " It is my tomb . There is no love in my beautiful house . But here I am buried away from them . My wife with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who give me nothing at all but son-in-laws with greedy eyes . My wife serves time in the prison I made for her miles away , with arbors and waterfalls ... gardens with flowers but never a rose . A curse is on them ... " <p> The shorter man burst in with a tray . He laid it , clattering , on the dresser . She smelled the food , something rich with spice , a tomato smell . He approached the bed . " Papa ? Papa ? You wanta eat ? " <p> The older man faintly shook his head . <p> " You want something to drink ? " He studied the silent face below . " You let me know , Papa . I get what you want . " <p> The older man stirred . " The usual , " he said . <p> " Papa , not that . They would know you are here . Who gives the order for it but you ? Like signing your name . " <p> " Then get out , " said the other , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for your protection . " <p> " No , it 's for yours . " <p> When he was gone , she put the tray away in the bathroom and closed the door . She could not bear the smell of the food . Nor could she account for the anger that swept her . It came like a wind that shook her and died . And all she wanted to do was leave , go to sleep , forget this stranger beyond her help . She could see herself , as she had upstairs , walking the street , finding a taxi , riding away ... drinking the cold as she rode away . She put on her coat and stopped before him . " I do n't know how to help you , " she said , " but your daughter will come . Now I will tell them who I am and then I will leave . " <p> He looked at her . " You know nothing , " he said . " A beautiful young woman , a madonna like yourself , do you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man away like blowing a fly . It is hard with a woman , but make them afraid and they will kill you to stop their fear . Greed and fear . It is all they know . " <p> She broke before him . " You make me afraid . " <p> " Bene ! " he cried with a force that surprised her . " Bene ! Bene ! It is what I wish . Now you will wait . " <p> " Wait for what ? " she said in despair . <p> But his eyes had closed . He had spent himself . She was drained as well . Too exhausted to stand , she drew a chair beside the bed . She sat before him resting her head not far from his . She was all but asleep when she heard his voice . <p> " Get Tony . " It was all he said . <p> Dazed with sleep , she walked to the door and opened it . She shrank from the brilliance of the light . Beside her was the unicorn , unbearable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asleep . One stretched at length on the leather sofa . The other slouched inert in a chair . She went to the taller , the one in the chair . She touched his shoulder and saw him spring with a hand to his holster . But seeing her , he stretched and yawned . " Tony ? " she said . <p> He did not deny it . <p> " He wants you , " she said . <p> " How is he now ? " He yawned again . She did not answer . He followed her in and stood looking down at the man on the bed whose eyes were closed . " What is it , Papa ? Tony is here . " <p> " Get me the priest . I want the priest . " <p> Tony shifted . " Papa , what do you want with a priest ? Now is not the time . " <p> The older man stared into his face . His voice was hostile , imperious . " Get me the priest . " <p> " A priest you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's taking time . She says you are fine . " <p> The sick man raised his head from the pillow . " The sin of this is on your head . " <p> " I 'll do it , Papa . " He turned and left . For a moment his shadow pierced the room . Then he closed the door . <p> The old man , exhausted , lay as if dead . She touched his brow . The fever was gone , but in its place was a moist chill . She took his hand . It was dry and cold . She raised the covers . She drew the rest of the gauze from the box and wound his leg more tightly with it . He winced once . <p> " Water , please . " <p> She paused then . His eyes pled . She saw in them an alliance with her against the man who had left the room . She had emptied the glass to wash his wound . She filled it in the bathroom and brought it back . She cradled his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head of a child . He drank long with the trust of a child . There was peace in his drinking , as if his thirst had waited for her , gathering force until she came .... So close to him , she caught the lotion scent of his skin , the laundered scent of his crisp shirt , and over it all the scent of blood that escaped the covers .... Memory came unbidden to her . Her arm about her father 's neck , while he lifted each of her feet in turn to empty its shoe of sand and shell , their faces close as he brushed the foot . And then her delight to be given the world to walk in without the pain .... <p> She laid him gently down again . After a moment he spoke as if he were telling a tale . " Tony will not get the priest . How many days will I lie here dead while Tony says to the world I live ? Till he thinks the whip is in his hand ? " <p> The train throbbed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shivering . She took off her coat and spread it over his trembling form . " There 's something I ask you to do , " he said . " Something you may not want to do . " <p> " I will try , " she said . <p> He waited till the harp was still . " Tony will not send for the priest . I want you to hear my confession now . " <p> She drew away . " I do n't know how . " <p> " Listen , " he said . " There is no one else .... " His fingers slowly sought the table . A sudden glow was in the room . She turned to see the lighted niche . The form on the cross was lean and gray ; the eyes were closed . The blood glistened on hands and feet . Turning back , she saw he had drawn a hand from the cover , the hand that bore the curious ring . With infinite care he crossed his forehead , his lips , his breast . <p> She waited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And then forget " He crossed his lips . They moved with words she could not hear . Then she heard him speak . " I was born to this . I was born to it and what could I do ? But every crime I acknowledge now . God sees them all . I acknowledge them . Over and over blood was spilled . Not my own , until today . Not by me . There was someone else to spill the blood . With a word from me . Is it better or worse to give the word and keep your hand ... ? " He broke off . " I lost my way . I had a wife and a beautiful child . I loved them more than life itself .... I lost them too . I lost my soul . I have lost enough , This hour it is my life I lose , but it 's not enough .... I buy the beautiful , costly things . Paintings , art ... so everywhere I look is good . I fill my eyes with what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good . In my house I allow no words not fit for the Holy Mother to hear . No love is there , but the words are good Gifts for the poor ... It 's never enough . It comes from blood . " <p> His eyes were on the lighted niche . " When I was a boy my mother said I would be the priest . We need a priest in the family , she said , to take the curse from so much blood . She prayed for it . In the church I watched her kneel and pray . I knew her words . Before the Virgin heard I knew . I wanted it too .... But my father died , my brother with him , and I was next . It was almost dark when they came to me . The room was full of the shadows of men . ' You are next , ' they said . I was twenty-one . My mother knelt and wept for me . ' What can you want with a boy ? ' she cried . ' A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Turn on the lights and leave , ' they said . ' No , ' she said , ' what you have to say will be said in the dark . ' And in my heart I wept with her . <p> " But when I saw Maria 's mother , radiant , lovely as the moon , I was glad then I was not the priest . And when her daughter was born to me I was glad again I was not the priest . But when she left and took her from me , I wished my mother had had her way . The blood I poured would be God 's , not man 's . And that is life instead of death ... ' . " <p> She was hardly aware of the words he gave . She heard their sorrow . She took their pain . She watched him cross his lips again . <p> " I am that man of crime ... of sin . I wept for it in the dark of night , and in the daylight I sinned again . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost the priest . I am that man whose soul belonged to the purest of women and to her daughter , my beautiful child . I came to love them more than God . Because of that He took them away . Not for the killings ... I went to the priest with all of that . But because I loved them more than God and never told it to the priest .... How could I tell what I would not change ? I knew in my heart ... I knew it better than any priest ... without that love I was nothing more ... than a man of crime , who gave his money for beautiful things ... to hide the blood . " <p> He seemed to have drifted into sleep . She waited , watching over him . When he woke he was looking at her with joy . " I dreamt you came . Can you forgive me , bedda mia ? " <p> Moved by his joy , she wept for him . Or for herself . She could not tell . He touched her hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , " she said . <p> " For my whole life ? And the garden too ? " <p> " Yes , " she said . It gave her a strange delight to say it . <p> " Do n't cry , " he pled . " No need to cry ... We 'll go away . We 'll tell no one . We 'll ride the carousel , " he said . He brushed the tangled hair from her throat . " You remember that ? " <p> She covered her face . " Yes , " she said . Strangely , there was a memory of it . Was it Maria 's or her own ? The horses leaping with the song , the world gone still to watch her as she rose on wings of music . Like the unicorn . <p> " I need the music now . " She thought he meant the carousel . But he raised his hand with a backward thrust . Behind the lamp she found the switch . Live and sweet was the tenor 's cry . It came from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with passion , it besought her now to live and love . The words were strange , but not the voice . She had heard it in her dreams . Then very close she heard her own , so like it seemed to be her own . It answered , yielding , joining his . She could not bear the sweetness of it . Or the pain ... <p> He signed to her to halt the music . She pressed the switch . He spoke into the silence . There was singing in his voice . " There is a country in my heart . A place between a priest ... and what I became . " He gazed at her with longing . " We would be happy . " <p> She pressed his hand . <p> " It 's getting dark . I ca n't see you . " <p> She bent her head to him . Her dark hair swept his face and she brushed it away . But he whispered , " Do n't take away your mother 's hair . " <p> She felt his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till it was hers as well . She saw his lips were moving . " In my will you have the money I made when I was young . A boy . A boy 's wages . I worked after school . It is clean .... I never spent it in the world I was given . I saved it for you .... Take it , will you take it from me ? " The pleading in his voice was encircled with the question . <p> " I will , " she said . <p> " A ring of my mother 's . A girl 's . Before my father . I have written it is yours . You will wear it for me ? " <p> She dropped her head to his pillow . She felt that she was sleeping . She did not want to wake . <p> He turned his face into her hair . " Can you know how much I love you ... and your mother in you ? Can you feel it ? " She had never heard the note in any voice before . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . " <p> Her tears were on the pillow . <p> " Have you waited , too ? " <p> She felt his simple waiting , his blood racing out of him and filling her silence . " Yes , " she whispered . <p> At that he seemed to fall asleep . She rose and walked to the window and pulled aside the drapery . The bars were stark as bones in the early light . Through a drift of mist she saw the wall . Who am I ? she wondered . Daughter ... stranger , what he finds in me I am . I have waited my life ... She was dazed with his words . If she took the elevator she would find the very words still alive in the room where she had made them hers .... Like the beat of her blood , she knew the coming of the train . It burrowed in her body ; deep , insistent , closer , with the singing of the harp , until it died away . Then above , the swift percussion of a manhole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sped away . <p> She heard his voice from the bed . She went to him quickly , and she saw with mourning that now she was no longer his daughter but herself . He held her eyes with his . She sensed that he was gathering his forces for an effort . " What is it ? " she said . <p> His lips were forming words , then she heard them . " The time ? " <p> She glanced at the clock . " It is early morning . " <p> Again his lips were forming words that had no sound . She shook her head . " Leave here . Now . " <p> " I want to stay with you . " <p> He turned his face from side to side . " No ! They will kill you . " He was silent for a moment . " If my daughter comes ... or Chico . They sent him . If he comes ... Water , " he signaled . <p> She raised his head and brought the glass to touch his lips . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with each swallow . Once more she knew . his lightness , the child in her arms . She laid him down again . She sensed his desperation . It surrounded them like air . " Food , " he said , struggling . <p> The tray was in the bathroom . There was wine in an opened bottle . She poured him a little , red as blood , and held him while he wet his lips . He drank but a sip , then turned his face away . But it seemed to revive him . <p> An urgency was in his voice . " Listen to me now and do as I say . Tell them there is a drug you need for me . It takes a prescription , but the hospital has it . They keep it locked up but you can find the key . Tell them you must n't wait for Chico . They must give you taxi fare . " <p> " I 'm afraid of them , " she said . <p> " No ... no . If Maria comes you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask you why he is n't here ... where he went when he brought you .... " He shut his eyes and seemed to think . The effort was on his face . He beckoned her close . " Tell them you sent him for things you need and could n't wait to get yourself You sent him back for them . Tell them that . " <p> " What if they do n't believe me ? " She fought her fear . <p> His voice was failing . " Make them believe . " Then he drew his hands from beneath the covers and pulled from one the curious ring . " Wear this , " he said , " and let them see it . " <p> His fingers shook beneath the lamp . She took the ring from him . It was a serpent of green enamel , twisted , biting its own tail , the scales and eyes inlaid with gold . They flashed in the yellow light . " What does it mean ? " <p> She could feel that he summoned all his strength to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He seemed to swoon , but she touched him and he spoke again . " When they told me she was dead ... the wife I lost was lost again ... I knew the ring was endless evil . I had made a circle of it . And so it would be .... " <p> She held it out to him . He waved it away . " Wear it , " he whispered . " My power is in it . They took an oath on it and kissed it . They will believe you have my trust . " <p> She put it on , and he kissed her hand . " You have been a daughter to me this night . " <p> She would not take away her hand . She had lived for thirty years and none had kissed her hand before . <p> He said in a voice that she must strain to hear . " When you are gone from here you must throw it away . You wo n't be safe if it 's found with you . Promise me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> His hand was groping among the covers . " The gun ? " he whispered . She found it and put it into his hand . " No , " he said , " it is for you . " She shook her head . " I ca n't ... I ca n't . " <p> He nodded slightly and closed his eyes . He moved his lips and she bent to him . " I need the music , " he seemed to say . " Go ... go ... " <p> She pressed the switch for him and heard the soaring of the tenor . She put on her coat and found her purse . She shut the music inside the room . <p> In the outer room the two men , slouching , came to their feet . She began to tell them about the drug , how she would get it and return . They listened to her with expressionless eyes . Beside her the unicorn listened too . His single horn was in her breast . <p> " Well , is he better ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " What drug is it ? " said the shorter one , whose name now she would never hear . If they let her go . <p> She began to say , " It 's a chemical name ... " <p> But Tony broke in with " Jesus Christ , it do n't matter the name . " He advanced upon her . She grew afraid he would take her purse and open it , see who she was , who she was not . With terrible effort she stood her ground . " You have blood on your skirt , " he said at last . <p> She belted her coat . ' I 'll wash it later . There is n't time . " <p> He nodded . " Chico should be around . Where did he go ? " <p> She found she had forgotten her speech , where Chico was , why he was n't here . Instead she answered , " My father said ... he said to give me taxi fare . " She steadied the hand she held for it . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaching inside his coat , was drawing the money and not the gun . <p> She saw that she took it and walked away , with the voice of the tenor following though it was locked inside the room . She saw that Tony rang for the lift . She found herself inside the cage .... <p> Outside was the cold of early dawn . Into the mist the street lights bloomed . But as she walked they faded away , one by one , as morning came . The voice o the tenor was with her still , rising , falling , beseeching her , The ring she wore was cold and loose . She let it fall inside her coat . Her fingers traced its circle there . Evil turning , beginning again . The horses going round and round ... rising , falling like the song . Her fingers traced a circle of pain , the pain of the woman like herself for whom it was now too late to come with the word of pardon , late for that . <p> She turned a corner , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She stopped as well and held her breath . She felt the breath gone out of him , the circles stopped ... the blood stopped . The pigeon roaming the still street was the only thing in the world that moved . <p> <p> By HELEN NORRIS <p>
