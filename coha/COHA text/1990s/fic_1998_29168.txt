Settled on the Cranberry Coast This I know : our lives in these towns are slowly improving . When Rosie grew up in the old reservation houses , the roads were dirt and the crab factory still wheezed along , ugly and reeking , and in early summer the factory stayed open all night -- it was the only work you could get -- and the damp dirty smell of the crab cooking in its steel vats blew off the ocean , all the way to Aberdeen , even farther , for all I knew . I remember driving home from movies in high school , the windows open , the sweet pulp-mill smell of Aberdeen tinged with that distant damp cardboard of Tokeland 's cooking crab . some money , and almost at once Tokeland plumped with antique stores and curiosity shops , and the old clapboard hotel became a registered landmark and got a profile in Sunset . The Shoalwaters did all right , too -- three years ago they sold their fishing rights to the Willapa and voted to put the money into the market , mostly into technology stocks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dividends , and now they buy fishing licenses like the rest of us . Their trawlers are easily the nicest around , you 'll notice them moored under the bridge in Aberdeen , the big sleek powerful monsters with aluminum hulls , blue-striped , the new nets , new radar . Rosie never married , and neither did I. We went to high school together , but we did n't travel in the same crowd . She was half Indian , and she tended to hang with the tough guys , pretty mild by today 's standards , I guess -- the kids who wore leather jackets , who smoked and overdid the hair gel . Rosie was beautiful , with thick brown shiny hair that reached the middle of her back , but I did n't have a chance at her . She was out of reach entirely , in another world . Her friends , if they drove anything at all , drove pickups instead of cars , and on Friday afternoons they 'd motor out to the ocean , pitching and hurtling over the dunes and then speeding down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a way , but I did n't want to be them . Tokeland back then was not a good place to be from . It meant the clapboard shacks for the Indians , and outhouses , and pump wells instead of piped water , all of it on an open spit of land that caught the worst of the ocean winds . Winters , Rosie would say later , the wind would blow all day , all night , until it was part of your soul , an extra function of your body , like your heart , or your breath . lived in the East for a few years with a woman I thought I would marry , but things , to make a long story short , did n't work out , and I came home . I took a job teaching high school history in Ocosta and kept at it for twenty-seven years , fishing during the summers and doing some casual carpentry , building rooms onto my house until my back yard was just about gone . Occasionally in the hardware store I 'd see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them prosperous fishermen or at least on their way , the luckiest having inherited their fathers ' boats , walking now with the casual swagger of money , wearing designer blue jeans and monogrammed dress shirts . Some of these guys made two hundred thousand dollars in a good year , I knew , and they always had the newest trucks , skinny wives with tousled hair and high heels . They 'd recognize me from school , a lot of them , and I 'd listen to them worry about their kids sleeping on the beach , the girlfriends and boyfriends , getting into this or that drug , trouble at school , and sometimes they 'd ask me for advice . I 'd try to tell them their kids would grow out of childhood , just as they themselves had , and privately I wondered why they could n't see themselves in their children . throwing out the battered posters , handing in my teachers ' editions for the last time -- I found I was restless . Fishing was n't enough to hold my attention A year . My old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dogs in various ways , and a lot had just moved somewhere else . I had some good friends at the high school but I did n't want to linger there , afraid someone might call me a sad old man . On a whim I advertised myself as a carpenter and plumber , but for months my only phone calls were from friends ; they 'd recognized my name on my sign , they said , and had called to see if it was really me . Oh , it 's me , all right , I told them . Then Rosie called . " I just bought a new house , " she said , " and it 's a big fucking wreck . " " Surprise , " she said . paper . " principal and the superintendent , and in the picture my stomach hung out a long , long way in its striped shirt , like a balloon edging through a doorway . I had n't known I looked quite like that , and staring at the paper I 'd felt as though I were seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm on a diet now , " I said . " All that cafeteria food . " Twin Harbors State Park sits right on the main roads in and out of the area , hundreds of campsites on both sides of the highway , one side forested and filled with mosquitoes , the other side scrubby and dry , with patches of sand where you pitch your tent in the Scotch broom and shore pine . The campsites sit right alongside one another , children run through the campground , the pit toilets smell . Years ago a friend of mine from college came out to visit me and insisted on camping there , and when I picked him up the next morning the place was littered with beer cans and broken glass , and in the campsite next to his was a sort of blackened skeleton that had been a little pine tree , the soil around it burnt brown . This is where Rosie worked . least engaging places can grow on you . The high school , a one-story yellow brick budding set down in a dirt field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from watching the traffic going by on the highway ; the cinderblock hallways were dim and stony . It was an ugly place , institutional . The trees around the edges of the athletic fields had all died from a kind of beetle blight and stood there for years , brown and dry , waiting to fall on the soccer players . But I had my morning car and my thermos of coffee , and there was an easy sort of swinging progression through the years , from holiday to holiday , and the kids were often interested and articulate , and there were lots of good mornings when they were thinking and their hands were raised , or I 'd have a sweet kid in a certain period who always understood my jokes , or pretended to . At one point a math teacher named Jack Patani , a little Italian guy , married one of his students , Isabel or Isadora , I could never remember . People were very understanding , for the most part . She was one of the sweet ones who adored him , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him good conversation and a nice young body , and it 's hard to argue with that . Rosie 's house sat among rhododendrons right over a little bridge behind the post office , and her back yard ran along the edge of a cranberry bog . She was standing in the driveway , unloading lumber from her pickup . She 'd cut her hair short , like a boys . She wore a white tank top , and her square face held deep wrinkles , like the soft folds in a bag . She stood straight and peered into my car . We shook hands . strange we have n't run into each other . " crinkled at the corners . Her eyebrows were thick and black . " Got the water hooked up . " weightlifter 's . A little rain had started , but she ignored it , put a hand over her eyes . Around the back of the house we could see the beginning of the hills , lit here and there with sun . The alders were in full leaf , and the cranberry bog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Down at the end of the road another little house sat , abandoned , its door gaping open as though to breathe , a tree growing through the windows . Somewhere we could hear a tractor . The ocean was a mile away across the highway , invisible , but I could smell it , the salty air . of a plastic wading pool . She was wearing white underpants and no shirt , and her belly hung out like a trucker 's . She had Rosie 's thick grainy black hair , the same strange overmuscled arms . in mine -- wet and warm , like a little frog in my palm . mildew . The light fixtures were gone , maybe stolen for scrap , and the cupboards were bashed in ; the floor had rotten patches , and the ceiling was a wreck , sagging and stained . The tractor ran noisily along the fence , tending the bogs . " This is what a ranger gets ? " I asked . bedrooms . The nails pinged along the floor . " So , " she said . tucked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hat -- it was stiff , as though it had been in the freezer . " The hat looks good , " I said . they rode off , Rosie glancing behind her as she backed down the driveway . That afternoon I drove down to Raymond to have lunch with my sister Jodie . She 's the principal of the elementary school , but when I found her she was in the teacher 's lounge eating a banana and talking on the telephone . She is more or less plump , depending , and her blond hair is most often permed , though that depends on whim , I think : she has thin hair , which she 's always hated , and for a while she wore hats everywhere . " Got some news , " I said , whispering . worksheets were stapled to the bulletin boards , and I could smell pee from the bathroom . I looked through the window in a classroom door and saw a teacher , a woman , very young , sitting on the carpeted floor , saying the days of the week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her fingers together for Tuesday , settled her hands on her shoulders for Wednesday , folded them over her breasts for Thursday . The children 's baby faces were set in earnest , their hands moving in grave imitation from shoulder to breast to cheek . calves . should have homework . " started I 'd told her about Rosie . " Whose name was Carolyn . Who I think ran off somewhere . I want to say she went to California . I think she worked as an apple picker for a while . " laid two fingers on her temple . " I 've got too many people up here , they 're all starting to look like one another . " for a minute , then Jodie said , " Does Rosie ever hear from her ? " " You do n't have a problem with that ? " it with the grandmother . " about it . " From Rosie that night I learned this : that Carolyn had made it to California , barely , and that Rosie had tracked her down at a strawberry farm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hannah , two years old , slung on her back in a shirt . Rosie brought Hannah home for the summer , then for the winter as well , and Carolyn never came to claim her ; she wrote twice from Mexico a year later , but on Hannah 's fifth birthday her mother was present only in her two letters tacked to Rosie 's fridge , in one smiling photograph of her with Hannah on her back , and in Hannah herself , who when asked about her mother remembered nothing , really , just the heat and shady hats , the ghosts of a few songs , and maybe the months of sunshine , and the easy dip and rise of Carolyn picking beans and fruit beneath her . Since retiring I 've put thousands of miles on my car , just driving . It 's a way of feeling busy , I suppose . Down to Raymond , inland to Pe Ell and Menlo , down to Vader , sometimes all the way down to Naselle and Skamokawa on the river and the way things used to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the boathouses on stilts . I can catch Portland radio down there but on the way back up it fades quickly . It 's a harmless way to live , more or less , and at least I 'm out of the house . And I keep maps : some fairly good ones , with all the little horse trails and logging roads , and a satellite photo , too , which I have tacked to the wall over the bed . In it the sea is a strange dark gray , and the wash from the mouths of the various rivers turns out to be a lighter color , almost a tan , and the roads are laid down like hairs . Houses , too , you can see : the tiniest little white spots , but if you know the roads you can say what 's what . The cranberry bogs are square red patches sewn into the flatlands near Tokeland , and Rosie 's house is there , too , behind the new brick post office , which sits in the middle of its parking lot like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notice is the bogs , which stretch for miles , tangled and dense , following the curve of the coastline . Finns , recognizing something familiar in the landscape , built them at the turn of the century , and they 're still beautiful things , even from the air . One afternoon when I was putting up gutters Rosie got out our yearbook and found me in it , combed and chubby . I climbed down from the ladder to look , though actually I 'd got the thing out myself weeks ago . " God , " she said . " Look at us . " She touched the hornrims . " It 's a miracle we did n't die laughing at each other . " you 're wondering . " A tractor was churning around the edges of the bog . the glossy pages . " Your grandmother , Hannah , was not a very good girl . " important to be with my friends . " She glanced at me , then at the tractor , which was coming toward us through the mud . bathroom tiles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close friend , " I said . seat and waved , then sat down and gunned the engine . Hannah cringed in Rosie 's lap . " Christ , " Rosie said . gapped. the gate back . " Thank you very much , " said the driver , and halfway to the road he stopped the tractor , stood , dropped his baggy jeans , and peed in a long yellow arc , fifteen or twenty feet , into Rosie 's driveway . Then he sat down again and drove off . the driveway , where she kicked dust over the mark . " That 's the sort of thing I did in school , honey , " she called across the yard , and I thought she might have been talking to either of us . Two weeks later we drove up to Grayland to watch the kite festival . The highway was lined with parked RVs , and a couple hundred people had gathered on the beach . Hannah gave a little gasp when she saw the kites , big fancy ones this year : tandem boxes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long rainbow tube , huge and dignified , hanging in the breeze like a blimp. windshield . She 's not used to having a man around , Rosie 'd said ; she does n't know what you 're going to do . I do n't know what I 'm going to do , I 'd said . her . " The kid knows her kites , " I said , and she nodded seriously . barbecuing hot dogs , wearing an apron . He had mustard in his mustache. many . " working up at the park ? " Rosie , " but I think you 've got a big dog following you around . " at her and barked , his boozy eyes red and haggard . " Woof , " he said . feeding her and everything . " a paper napkin ; she took it boldly with both hands . I envied the easy way he talked to her , and her smiling for him . been here before . " and bushy . " Nice kite , " I said . reel , which pulled up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms around Hannah from behind . She was sweaty and smelled like sun and dirt and meat . The surf rolled over and over itself up the beach . We watched the tube hang majestically above us , spinning in place , like a dream animal . " Three thousand miles , " she sang , " miles , miles , miles . " Over the next couple weeks the house got sturdier . I found some old oak boards in my shed and used them to patch the floor . I gutted the kitchen and put in a new fridge , new cupboards , a window over the sink . I was proud of my work -- it was quick , cheap , and I did n't make any mistakes , no cuts too short , no crooked wallpaper . The new wall in the kitchen was solid , stronger than the original . Rosie and I worked into the night , the television on in the living room while we put up plasterboard . Sometimes , talking , we woke Hannah , who would come toddling out of Rosie 's room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hair shone a sort of steely gray . She wandered over , peered into the joint compound bucket , watched me spread the stuff back and forth . I took a fingerful and laid it in her palm . " Do n't eat that , " Jodie came up one night during that last week with a bottle of wine and a twelve-pack of Henry 's . We opened the gate to the cranberry bog and sat down on the grass . The cranberries were pale pink and small , hidden under the creeping leaves . " Here , " Rosie said , dropping a handful in my glass . " A touch of elegance . " around like ball bearings . school . " Hannah said nothing , just crouched at the edge of the bog , collecting the brightest berries she could find . from the ocean , squeezing through the pines and sliding past at eye level . Little tufts settled in the ditches , and scraps hung up in the trees like laundry . becoming drunk and was making generous gestures . " No . Actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teach her . What am I saying ? But I remember her . More or less . " opened another beer . " A very pretty girl . " time soon , " Rosie said . about the way she said our made us all look over at Hannah , who lay picking at the grass . I could imagine moving in with these two , sure , sleeping on the sofa at first -- an urge to lend a hand , I suppose , to take on this little family -- though they seemed whole there , at the edge of the bog , as if that our had sealed them off from us somehow . Rosie wore a strange expression , not of wonder , exactly , which you 'll see on new mothers , but something closer to acceptance , and regret . I was drunk but not drunk enough to say what I wanted , that we do n't live our lives so much as come to them , as different people and things collect mysteriously around us . I felt as though I were coming to Rosie and Hannah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even something I think about anymore . She 's gone , gone , gone . And now here 's Eddie . " She kissed me on the cheek . " Am I drunk ? " she asked . Her eyes were bright . about her , " she said . " No point anymore . " I sat , holding my beer . What was she imagining ? Pheasants in the migrants ' shacks , the mattresses that swelled with dew and rain between seasons ? " No point , " she said . Her lowered voice , the finality of it , and I imagined the orchards hanging full of fruit , a faceless Carolyn lost in the trees . I spent the night on Rosie 's sofa and woke up early , not sick exactly but with the feeling that a wind was blowing through my head , that I had created a few vacancies upstairs . I made coffee and sat on the front porch , facing the back of the post office . The flagpole was still empty ; it was Saturday . The yard was littered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gut on my lap , plaster dust all over my pants . " Good morning , " I said . another spoonful , sat down next to me. want to come along . " noticed the delicate point of her chin , like Rosie 's chin . out her seatbelt , but she grabbed the two ends and clicked them together . I could think of nothing to say . Her presence was palpable , her thick meaty smell . We were both a little tense . " We could get you an ice cream cone there , " I said , and then remembered it was only eight in the morning . " Or maybe some pancakes . " glove compartment . Patani said ? He 'd married Isabel , Isadora , to give himself a few more good times . Still happy together , those two , and he 'd had several nice years , was looking at many more . I admitted to myself , then -- I allowed myself to think , then , for the first time , about marrying Rosie . I still hardly knew her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her hands still clasped together . unbuckled her seatbelt , and lifted her against my shoulder . I carried her inside , the lopsided sack of her against me . Around us stretched miles of lumber and pipes , and somewhere I heard a saw whining , but she did n't wake up ; and as I walked through the aisles she spread her arms , her fat arms , to hold my neck , and I imagined that she remembered this strolling motion , and that more than any rocking could , or singing , it soothed her . I talked to the salesmen , and I handed over my wallet . Outside , it was raining , and I waited under a metal overhang . She slept as they loaded the radiators , clanking , into the trunk of my car , one after the other -- they angled out awkwardly , and I had a flag tied on -- and then I was alone with Hannah in the parking lot , waiting for the rain to stop , and I stood watching the rain come down over the river , over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I smoothed her hair with my hand , her head perfectly round against my shoulder , and I stood -- I was on the verge of something , I could feel it -- and I just waited there , listening to her easy , settled breathing .
