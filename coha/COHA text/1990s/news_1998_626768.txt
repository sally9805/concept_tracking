<p> SHE is unnaturally still for a 10-year-old , so you might think that she 's older . Or maybe this person sitting motionless in a small wheelchair is somehow mature beyond her years . <p> Then she asks the question . <p> " Mama , " she says , timing her words to the ventilator wheezing in the background , " can I have some bubble gum ? " <p> Reality check . Xzavia Baines is just a kid . <p> And no , there will be no bubble gum for Xzavia , not this afternoon or any other . The risk of swallowing it is too great for a child who depends upon a machine to breathe . <p> It is just one of the rites of childhood lost when her neck was broken in a car accident last year . <p> There have been other losses , too , many of them far greater . But with all of that , Xzavia - the girl who loved school and karate and had lived her short life on fast-forward - is still a child . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Still likes to play games only when she is winning and claims to be a teen-ager even if everyone else says she has three more years to go . <p> Still issues a warning as she thinks about the new wheelchair she is learning to control with puffs of her breath : " I 'm going to run over everybody . I 'll go wherever I want to go . " <p> No bubble gum does n't mean no future , just a very different today for Xzavia and the people who love her . <p> " We went from one life to another , " says Esternata Demby , who , as Xzavia 's mother , is there for the journey . " It 's like our whole life collapsed . " <p> The collapse began on April 27 , 1997 , a Sunday and Xzavia 's ninth birthday . Demby , a single mother , finished her overnight shift at Compaq Computer Corp . and picked up her children , Xzavia and 3-month-old Kendrick Spikes , who had spent the night with relatives . <p> It was raining , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the car slid into a ditch and struck a culvert . Demby , seriously injured and stunned by the air bag , heard Kendrick crying from the back seat . <p> Xzavia , who had been seated next to him , was ominously silent . <p> Not long afterward , Nick Baines Jr . received a telephone call from an ambulance driver : " Your daughter 's on the way to the hospital . She 's not breathing right now . " <p> Baines had spent the past six years in the Air Force , enjoying the travel and the financial security . But his only child was growing up too fast without him back home in Houston , and he had returned just a few months earlier to spend more time with Xzavia . <p> On that terrifying morning , everything crawled in slow motion as he concentrated on getting to Ben Taub General Hospital for the beginning of what would be a very long vigil . <p> Xzavia 's prognosis shifted over the next few weeks . She was unlikely to live ; she would have brain damage if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move anything below her nose . During weeks of waiting , Baines tried to stay focused on one thought : " Having her still here was more important than anything . Just letting her be here on Earth . " <p> Kendrick 's injuries were n't serious , but Demby was badly hurt and required surgery when her lungs collapsed . As Xzavia began to regain consciousness , everyone sensed her unspoken question : Where was her mother ? <p> Finally nurses rolled Demby , gingerly propped in a wheelchair , into Xzavia 's room . <p> " She had all these breathing tubes in her throat , " Demby says . " She did n't look like herself . She was swollen . <p> " Once she started coming to , she would cry and cry . " <p> Xzavia has seen the pictures of herself from that time , but her memories are hazy . When she thinks of the accident , mainly she thinks about the things she misses most : " Writing , playing my Nintendo , going to school . " <p> A third-grader at Clark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been schooled at home for the past year but will return to a regular classroom in August . <p> She 's scared . <p> A healthy chunk of the mischievous , outgoing child she once was still lurks beneath her immobile exterior , but her confidence is shaky , especially when she tries to predict how future classmates might greet her . <p> " They 're going to tease me and make fun of me . " <p> Xzavia 's neck was broken at the first cervical level , just below where the head connects to the spinal cord . At first she could n't move or feel anything below her neck ; she now can shrug her shoulders slightly , and nurses say she can move both thumbs a little . <p> Generally , the higher the break , the more permanent the damage . High breaks are more common in children than adults because children 's heads are bigger in proportion to their bodies and ligaments supporting the spinal column are n't as strong , says Dr. Kathryn Zidek , who runs the pediatric program at The Institute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TIRR after more than two months at Ben Taub . Therapists taught Demby and Baines to administer the breathing treatments their daughter requires every four hours , using a mist to break up the secretions in her chest , then tapping firmly to dislodge them . Her oxygen levels have to be monitored , her arms and legs guided through range-of-motion exercises , her meals prepared and fed to her . <p> In addition to her daunting physical needs , Xzavia 's parents began to fathom the financial implications of this new life . Money became a serious problem , with bills mounting so quickly that they soon lost track . <p> Demby and Baines , who never married , remember the first months after the accident as full of conflict , usually about money . Eventually , they reached a truce . " It does n't do us any good to not get along , because it 's not going to help Xzavia , " Baines says . <p> Demby had worked at Compaq since 1996 , leaving a retail job for the higher wage of $ 7.50 an hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time ; he recently joined the Houston Police Department . <p> Xzavia was covered by both parents ' insurance policies , but that did n't solve their financial problems . <p> " Most families are aware they have insurance , but until they get into a situation like this , that 's when they see the limitation of policies emerge , " says Mary Ellen Sherrill , a clinical social worker in TIRR 's pediatric program . <p> Not everything is covered , and with catastrophic injuries like Xzavia 's , policies are often exhausted within a few years . <p> Other challenges also loomed in the new life Demby had to assemble . Most pressing was the question of where they would live . <p> The third-floor apartment she and her children had shared would n't work for a child in a wheelchair ; her brother 's wife found them a three-bedroom , ground-floor apartment in north Houston before Xzavia was released from TIRR . <p> The small master bedroom became Xzavia 's , with Barbie sheets covering her hospital bed and an oxygen tank and banks of monitors crowding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reminds visitors to " Please Wash Hands Before Handling Xzavia . " <p> The other bedrooms hold boxes of medical supplies and more equipment , including a computer that Xzavia can work with one eyebrow . <p> A small bed is squeezed into one bedroom ; Demby sleeps wherever she can , whenever she can , and Kendrick , now almost 17 months old and unable to remember anything different , often stays with his father . <p> Home health nurse Mary K. Byars has cared for Xzavia since she came home from TIRR . <p> " She was a very scared little girl , " Byars says . " It was like , ' What 's going to happen to me ? ' " <p> There have been days filled with tears and others filled with video games and sassy talk about Hollywood star Will Smith . Byars has tried to show Xzavia that she has many reasons to live despite all the treatments , trips to the doctor and bouts of depression . <p> " She has not given up on herself , " Byars says . <p> But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requires 24-hour-a-day care , because her ventilator can malfunction without warning , making it impossible for her to breath . <p> Her bones are more prone to fractures . She has to be shifted at least once an hour to prevent skin ulcers , and she 's susceptible to pneumonia and other respiratory infections . She ca n't control her body temperature , making it risky to be outdoors long in Houston 's steamy summers . <p> All these health problems mean she probably wo n't live as long as she would have otherwise . <p> Adjusting to such drastically changed circumstances is made even harder by the modern trend toward shorter hospital stays , says Worth Whiteside , a TIRR social worker who handled Xzavia 's case . <p> Twenty years ago , patients as seriously injured as Xzavia might have spent six months or a year in rehab ; now it 's a couple of months . <p> " You ca n't speed up the process of adaptation , " Whiteside says . " It takes longer for the family to fathom what 's happened , to get prepared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kid is hospitalized . " <p> Most patients leave rehab expecting to see more improvement , he said . That seldom happens to any substantial degree . <p> But even now , more than a year after the accident , Xzavia 's family is n't so sure that she wo n't somehow defy the odds . <p> " I do n't believe it , " says her grandmother , Gloria Aniagboso . " She 's still a child . I believe she 's going to pull through this . " <p> Demby scraped by on savings and help from Baines and her family while Xzavia was hospitalized . But by the time she came home , money was running out . <p> Demby needed a paycheck . <p> She tried to return to Compaq in September but says she was told she 'd been fired because paperwork related to her disability leave was filed late . She sued in federal court , accusing the computer maker of firing her to drop Xzavia from its insurance rolls . The case could take several years to resolve . <p> A Compaq spokesman said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Xzavia is still covered by Baines ' insurance . Kendrick is insured through his father , too . Demby has n't had health insurance since she lost her job at Compaq . <p> That may change soon . She began work on the assembly line of a small computer company in early May . Recent changes in federal law will require the company to cover Xzavia , too , once Demby accumulates enough hours to qualify for coverage . <p> It will be a relief , although most days Demby may be too tired to care . At 32 , she is a thin , stylish woman , her perfectly coiffed hair and careful makeup hinting at glamour despite the shadows beneath her eyes , the sunken cheeks that speak of exhaustion . <p> Ask her to describe a typical day , and she is at a loss . Where does one day end and another begin ? How can she keep Kendrick - just at that stage of walking and talking and getting into everything - out of trouble while she 's giving Xzavia a breathing treatment ? How to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enrolled in a new school in time for officials there to plan for her special needs ? <p> How to balance her fears for Xzavia against her frustrations with the changes the accident has forced ? <p> Often , the family simply takes refuge inside its apartment , curtains drawn against the stares of neighborhood children whose curiosity has driven Xzavia 's dread about returning to school . <p> She spent the past school year in the Aldine Independent School District 's homebound program , where twice-weekly sessions with Nikki Fagan provided a more personal style of teaching . <p> Fagan occasionally even made cookies during class , giving Xzavia practice in reading directions and explaining them - a way she can participate in activities , even if she ca n't do things physically - as well as using math skills to double a recipe or cut it in half . <p> It was also fun , and that was important . <p> Being in a regular classroom is important , too , even though the prospect is daunting . <p> Academically , Xzavia is ready for fifth-grade work , Fagan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a reading list for the summer , and she 's taking away a memory of a little girl who has grown up during the past nine months . <p> " She has a lot more confidence in herself , " Fagan says . " She 's processed what has happened to her . . . . She realizes she can still have a life . That was the biggest thing I wanted for her , to plan to not give up . " <p> That has been the goal of the past few weeks , too , as Xzavia participates in an outpatient program at TIRR to prepare her for school . <p> When occupational therapist Todd Novak gently asked what she hoped to accomplish on that first day , Xzavia did n't answer for a moment . " So I can move , " she finally told him , her voice almost inaudible . <p> Novak made no promises , focusing instead on the fun she would have learning to use a mouthstick and driving her power wheelchair . <p> And she has , buying a taste of independence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any distance , she will still depend on the Metropolitan Transit Authority 's door-to-door van service . <p> Metrolift charges $ 1.15 per rider , a bargain compared to the $ 80 or more a day for a rented van equipped with a wheelchair lift . <p> Metrolift serves 4,000 people a day and requires 24-hour notice . Metro spokeswoman Raequel Roberts says that works fine for most people , although regular riders say it 's impossible to rule out delays , complicating even well-planned outings . <p> Transportation is just one of the issues families with disabled kids routinely face . <p> Others will continue to crop up with the challenges of long-term care . Xzavia 's insurance company , which initially covered around-the-clock nursing care and then cut back to 16 hours a day , agreed again to 24-hour care when Demby started back to work in May . But no one is sure how long that will last . <p> Social workers say , do n't count on it forever . <p> " The idea of any insurance company is to slowly train the family to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked by Xzavia 's insurance company to assess the family situation . <p> Even as a single parent , Demby will eventually be expected to fend without home health nurses paid by the insurance company , Fernandez says . <p> Baines has learned to do his daughter 's treatments , but he does n't live with her to perform them . And while Demby 's six siblings visit often and help financially , she says she ca n't expect them to take on Xzavia 's physical care - they have jobs and families and work crazy hours and juggle all the other responsibilities common to modern life . <p> " There are not anywhere near the types of community services that people probably imagine are out there , " says Whiteside . " Families draw upon inner strength and resources , their church family , neighborhood support . " <p> But support can come from strangers , too , through stories of their courage and success . <p> Actor Christopher Reeve suffered an injury similar to Xzavia 's when he fell from a horse in 1995 . He also requires around-the-clock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay , saying his wife could handle it . <p> He insisted on help , and he won . He since has championed the cause of raising lifetime limits on insurance benefits . <p> Now Xzavia 's family tapes television interviews with Reeve and point out similarities to her case . Look ! His son used to be afraid of him in his wheelchair , just as Xzavia 's young cousins sometimes shy away from her . They repeat his optimism that a way will be found to reverse some of the damage of spinal cord injuries . <p> A closer-to-home role model arrived in February , when Mayor Lee Brown named Kathleen DeSilva to Metro 's governing board . A lawyer for TIRR , DeSilva has been a quadriplegic since she was a teen-ager . <p> Novak , the occupational therapist , has promised to set up a meeting with DeSilva as part of Xzavia 's outpatient therapy this summer . <p> So Xzavia thinks that maybe she 'll be a lawyer when she grows up , or a nurse , or a teacher . <p> But for now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Fortune , with a nurse or relative working the controls , and listens to music . <p> She loves to eat . She loves to talk . <p> " Some days she surprises me with what all she can do , what she thinks , " Baines says , shaking his head . " She has her own opinion of things . "
