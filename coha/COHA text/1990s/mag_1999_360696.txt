Until last week , Steven Fox was just another gun-violence victim with a depressingly familiar story . He was a high school freshman hanging out on a New York City street corner when a friend 's pistol went off , sending a bullet into Fox 's head . What sets Fox apart is that he went on to testify  --  with the bullet still lodged in his brain  --  in a landmark lawsuit against gunmakers . Last week a Brooklyn jury handed Fox a $500,000 award that has hit the gun industry with the force of a TEC-9 assault weapon . In a decision that could put gunmakers in the same kind of legal jeopardy as Big Tobacco , the jury found 15 companies engaged in " negligent distribution " of guns and ordered three to pay Fox for his injuries . Critics say the suit will open the floodgates to similar suits across the U.S. <P> The Brooklyn case was built on an innovative theory . It argued that gunmakers should pay for injuries from illegally obtained guns because their distribution practices let guns fall into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gun trafficking , including the " straw buyers , " who resell guns to minors and convicted felons , and the " iron pipeline " of illegal guns that flows from states with lax gun laws , like Georgia , to states with tough ones , like New York . <P> But the industry was also declaring victory . Of the 25 gunmakers sued , 10 were cleared . And the jury awarded nothing to six other plaintiffs , all of them relatives of people killed by guns . " It 's a defense verdict , " insists Anne Kimball , a lawyer for three of the gunmakers . " For them to have labored for four years and to have no damages in six of the seven cases and only $500,000 in the seventh is not a plaintiffs ' win . " The defendants have asked the trial judge to set aside the verdict . Failing that , they say , they 'll win on appeal . The gun industry insists the jury got it wrong . " What we 're talking about here are criminal acts , illegal sales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Criminals bear the blame , she says , not gunmakers . <P> How much litigation is likely to result from the verdict ? Chicago , New Orleans , Atlanta and Miami have already filed suits against gunmakers , seeking compensation for medical and law-enforcement costs due to gun violence . And Philadelphia , Boston and Los Angeles are considering jumping in . But the gun lobby has begun fighting back . Georgia 's legislature passed a bill last week to block Atlanta 's lawsuit , and Louisiana Governor Mike Foster is backing a similar law to stop New Orleans ' . But the gun lobby may not have the muscle to get such laws passed in other states . In fact , states may also start to sue , as they did against the tobacco companies . And after the Brooklyn verdict , individual gun victims have more reason than ever to file claims . <P> Some legal experts say the case could push the industry into a collective settlement like the tobacco industry 's . Gunmakers could be forced to pay for past harm and alter their marketing practices to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major defeat for the industry . But if a few more courts follow the Brooklyn verdict , victims of gun violence may be going into court with all the firepower .
