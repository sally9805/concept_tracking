<p> Here 's a little-known fact for Black History Month . <p> The first U.S. record company to release a Beatles single was Vee-Jay , owned by African-Americans . And it was the same company that had one of rock 's biggest pre-Beatles groups , the Four Seasons . <p> Much of the postwar popular music that has shaped contemporary taste - blues , country , rhythm-and-blues , rock ' n ' roll - was released by small , entrepreneurial independent companies . And there was room for black businessmen and women to get involved in the golden years , pre-1970 . ( For marketing reasons , one company usually created several labels . ) <p> It was not an easy business . Independent companies fought with their distributors to get paid and stay solvent , cajoled and sometimes paid off disc jockeys to play their records and resisted their ( often-youthful ) artists ' attempts to get fair royalty payments . And as books like " Music Man " and " Hit Men " have shown , some of the owners were very tough and disagreeable characters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been long-lasting - monumental , even . And except for Motown 's Berry Gordy Jr. , who created his empire in the spotlight of the civil rights movement of the 1960s , the role of black-owned labels has been little publicized . <p> That 's changing , however . The catalyst has been the popularity of compact-disc boxed sets , especially those that collect " roots " songs originally released decades ago on 45 or 78 rpm vinyl . <p> And a subcategory has emerged - sets devoted to the history of influential independent record companies . These , which usually contain detailed historical booklets , have allowed us to finally start learning about long-vanished , black-owned labels . <p> A warning , however . Many of the key , independent labels in the development of post-war black music were not black-owned - Atlantic , Chess , King and Specialty , for example . Memphis ' influential Stax Records , while founded by two whites , was led by a black man during its later years . And those companies that were black-owned often were as interested in chasing the Top-40 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , Delta blues . <p> The Vee-Jay company , started in 1953 in Gary , Ind. , but closely associated with Chicago , certainly chased rock ' n ' roll hits . The owners were a husband-and-wife team , Jimmy Bracken and Vivian Carter , who owned a record store . Their ear for doo-wop , a kind of group-harmony singing popular with black ( and subsequently all ) teens , led to a big hit immediately - " Baby It 's You " by James " Pookie " Hudson and the Spaniels . They then started recording one of the most distinctive blues singers of the era , Jimmy Reed . <p> By 1962 , Vee-Jay was so powerful that it released the Four Seasons ' breakthrough hit singles , starting with " Sherry . " Since British pop was n't popular in the U.S. at the time , Capitol Records , owned by Great Britain 's EMI , did n't want to bother with its parent company 's artist roster . So it allowed Vee-Jay to release the first several Beatles singles . <p> Alas , Vee-Jay was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had left . The three-disc set " The Vee-Jay Story 1953-1993 " chronicles much of the label 's best music other than those two groups - Reed , the Spaniels , Jerry Butler and one of Little Richard 's finest vocals ever on the slow , gospel-derived " I Do n't Know What You Got . " <p> One of the earliest of the African-American labels also is one of the least known , because it only lasted from 1946-1952 . But Swingtime/Downbeat , owned by L.A. bandleader and record distributor Jack Lauderdale , was a comfortable home for artists developing bittersweet West Coast blues . <p> It featured subdued horns , jazzy guitar and mournful piano phrases . Among his artists ( some first were with other small companies that Lauderdale purchased ) were Ray Charles , Lowell Fulson , Jimmy McCracklin and Lloyd Glenn . <p> Lauderdale could n't maintain the business , though . Before closing down , he moved to Chicago and tried country-and-western records . Since Lauderdale basically did n't release albums , the two-disc " The Swingtime Records Story 1946-1952 " is an extremely valuable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the music business as " Juggy Murray , " was a New York businessman who became interested in youth-oriented black music through a deejay friend . He started Sue Records in Harlem in 1957 , but then moved to midtown Manhattan where his building had its own recording studio . As Gordy eventually would do in Detroit , Murray supervised every aspect of his company 's releases , from the production to the promotion . <p> His labels , Sue and Symbol , were known for their colorful trademark designs and for Murray 's ability to get a commercial , pop-oriented sound out of gospel-influenced artists . The new , four-disc " Sue Records Story : The Sound of Soul " covers his releases in surprising depth . <p> While Murray did n't have a lot of hits from 1957-1966 , when he sold his catalog to United Artists Records , those he had are memorable because of their forcefulness - Inez Foxx 's " Mockingbird , " Bobby Hendrick 's " Itchy Twitchy Feeling , " Baby Washington 's ethereal " That 's How Heartaches Are Made " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Murray was involved in starting one of the most interesting , if short-lived , of all African-American pop-music labels , New Orleans ' AFO ( All For One ) Records . He financed its startup in 1961 and agreed to distribute it . <p> Two jazz musicians , Harold Battiste and Melvin Lastie , had started AFO because they were tired of seeing outsiders sign up and make money off the Crescent City 's black talent . ( However , they were not reverse-racist . One of their artists was Dr. John , the white singer/pianist immersed in New Orleans ' black-music traditions . ) <p> But as soon as AFO scored a Top-40 hit with Barbara George 's tangy " I Know , " Murray scuttled the distribution deal and kept George for himself . AFO kept going as an obscure independent until 1963 , when Battiste moved to California . He ended up producing Sonny &; Cher 's " I Got You Babe , " and then helped Dr. John find fame as the Night Tripper . <p> A new and excellent single-disc collection of AFO 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Gumbo Stew : Original New Orleans R &B."; <p> Another important New Orleans R &B; label , Minit Records , was white-owned but owed its success to the **28;778;TOOLONG talents of Allen Toussaint , a black man . Its history - early-1960s hits like " Mother-In-Law , " " Ooh Poo Pah Doo " and " Lipstick Traces " - is celebrated on the new , two-disc " The Minit Records Story . " <p> No African-American record-label owner is more controversial than the late Don Robey . In the book " What Was the First Rock ' n ' Roll Record , " he 's characterized as " a Houston gangster a light-skinned Jewish-Negro who owned a nightclub , a booking agency and Peacock Records " and " a violent man who surrounded himself with bodyguards . " <p> He started Peacock Records in 1949 and nurtured the careers of Texas bluesman Clarence " Gatemouth " Brown and the incomparable Big Mama Thornton , who recorded the original " Hound Dog " for Robey . <p> And when he acquired Memphis ' Duke Records in 1953 , he won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all soul singers , Bobby " Blue " Bland . Balladeer Johnny Ace ( " Pledging My Love " ) was one of Robey 's artists when he killed himself playing Russian roulette . <p> Duke/Peacock lasted into the 1970s , when it was purchased by ABC Records . It always released good material but remained too rooted in hard-edged Southern music to be a steady Top 40 contender . <p> In recent years , MCA Records has been reissuing discs of Duke/Peacock material . There are multiartist " Greatest Hits " and " Greatest Blues Hits " collections , along with single retrospectives for Thornton , Little Junior Parker and O.V. Wright . And there are two fine two-disc sets of Bland 's work . <p> Sam Cooke was a contradictory figure in pop music . Trained as a gospel singer whose musical subject matter and ethereal voice were connected to community traditions , he traded that background for stardom with catchy , teen-oriented songs ( " Only Sixteen , " " Wonderful World " ) that often de-emphasized the beat . <p> Yet at the height of his stardom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help gospel-derived black music succeed at the marketplace . The label , which he ran with Roy Crain and J.W. Alexander , lasted from 1959 to shortly after his death in 1964 . <p> As chronicled on the new two-disc " Sam Cooke 's SAR Records Story , " SAR offered up plenty of music that was more rugged than his own material , such as the Valentinos ' singles . But there also were acts who sounded much like Cooke , and indeed recorded his compositions . Bobby Robinson has been active in the music business since 1946 , when he opened a Harlem record store . His glory years were from the late-1950s through the mid-1960s , when he maintained a fistful of boldly titled labels - Fire , Fury , Flame , Everlast and Enjoy . <p> He released tracks that were gritty , raucous and down-home , yet somehow catchy or novel enough for the mainstream Top-40 audience . It was quite an accomplishment . <p> In this regard , his company was like Sue Records . And the two-disc " The Fire/Fury Records Story " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Kansas City , " Buster Brown 's " Fannie Mae , " Lee Dorsey 's " Ya Ya , " and Bobby Marchan 's " There 's Something On Your Mind . " <p> But Robinson also had a fondness for giving seemingly washed-up blues veterans a second chance . This worked most spectacularly with Elmore James , the stingingly effective slide guitarist whose " Dust My Broom " is a classic . By the 1970s and the success of Motown , things had changed . With money from industry giant Columbia Records , the African-American producers Kenneth Gamble and Leon Huff started one of the Me Decade 's most important record companies , disco-oriented Philadelphia International . And now , it seems , everybody has his or her own label . <p> But that did n't just occur out of thin air . It happened because of the enduring influence of rhythmic post-war " roots " music . And those pioneering records were being created because some hardy entrepreneurs , including some important African-Americans , saw an opportunity .
