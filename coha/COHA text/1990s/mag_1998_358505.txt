NOW FOR THE REAL OSCAR WINNERS ... <P> The Babylonian backslapping fest that is the Academy Awards has passed again , and 43 people have fetching new doorstops . But after every Oscar ceremony there are folks who won whether or not they took a little gold guy home . People like Peter Fonda . His nomination coincided with the release of his memoir Do n't Tell Dad , neatly rescuing it from **40;6289;TOOLONG status . And HELEN HUNT 'S agent . Two Emmys and an Oscar really help in renegotiating your client 's sitcom contract . Then there 's CHER . Just when folks were thinking of her as the late Congressman 's ex , Bob Mackie and that hat reminded us why she 's famous . Mothers were also big winners this year . MATT DAMON and BEN AFFLECK brought theirs , as did Vanessa Redgrave , Robin Williams and Naomi Judd . And finally , Stanley Donen . His sweet , self-effacing song made a pointed contrast to Titanic director Jim Cameron 's " King of the World " shtick . There were losers too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , did n't recognize Rosa Parks , Tyra Banks or Mercedes McCambridge and asked five-time nominee , one-time winner Robert Duvall if he 'd ever been nominated before . Just plain E ! mbarrassing . <P> IT 'S THE FROCKSCARS ! <P> The rush to dress the stars was more frantic than ever , to the point where Escada made fabric especially to match nominee Gloria Stuart 's eyes . But most celebs played it safe , which made ROBIN WILLIAMS ' suit  --  he quipped that it came from " the Giorgio Armani Amish collection "  --  look all the more stylish . ROD STEIGER went for the minimalist T shirt and jewelry look , apparently unaware that this works only on people with near perfect bodies , like MINNIE DRIVER , who wore a " take that , Matt Damon " Halston . MADONNA mixed designers , but oops , they did n't match . <P> COME FLY WHO ? <P> Poor CRISTY ZERCHER . The most newly proclaimed Clinton harassee , whose story appears this week in the Star , did n't get nearly as much for telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who claims Clinton stroked her breast from the side for 40 minutes and fondled a suggestively shaped orange during campaign flights , was paid about $50,000 for her story . Gennifer Flowers made three times that . " It 's getting a little like Filene 's Basement out there , " says the Star 's editor in chief , Phil Bunton . When TIME spoke to Zercher , she was a little foggy on dates and details , but not enough for the story to be easily labeled a fiction . And Zercher claims she 's not in it for the money . She says , " I 'd like to tell my story and go back to my job . " Good luck . <P> LEO THE LIVID <P> Currently the subject of four best-selling paperback books , LEONARDO DICAPRIO does n't want to become the subject of a best-selling issue of Playgirl as well . According to a suit DiCaprio 's lawyers filed last week , the skin magazine is planning to publish pictures of the star of The Man in the Iron Mask without anything masking him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen the photos and does n't know whence they came , they are thought to be from the movie Total Eclipse , which has a gay sex scene . Brad Pitt fought a similar case last year and won , but only after the issue was out . DiCaprio was tipped off to the magazine 's plan when the editor resigned in shocked  --  shocked !  --  disbelief that Playgirl would run pictures of famous people nekkid . <P> Q &A;
