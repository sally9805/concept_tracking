 | " That 's not it . Or yes it is , but it 's not . You see , " he began , but then lost courage , deflating into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Scott ? " " Listen , Em , this is none of my business , but ? " His false starts were beginning to wear on my general lack of patience . " What is none of your business ? " I snapped . Scott 's eyes flashed anger at me . Or was it contempt ? Just be careful , damn it , " he muttered . " About what ? " I snapped . " Listen , enough with the veiled threats . Are we going to talk about Lost Coyote or are n't we ? " " Okay , the damned field . " " Right , the goddamned field . " I opened my mouth to say So talk , goddamn it , but curiosity got the better of me . Steadying the tone of my voice into neutrality , I repeated , " What is none of your business ? " Scott looked wretched . After several more false starts , he finally said , " Listen , Em , Pete Tutaraitis can be trouble . I do n't really want to go into it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of my personal business ! " Scott looked as if he 'd been slapped . He stared at his desk top . " I 'm sorry , Scott , " I mumbled , trying to put the best face on my temper . " Let 's just talk about the field . " Scott fiddled with his pencil . Finally he nodded . " Listen , this does n't have to involve you . Maybe it 's really best if you stay out of this . " " Except that it does involve me . I am the geologist for this field . " " Right , you are . Nominally , anyway . " " Right . " I bit back another outburst . " So tell me . " Scott looked at me rather miserably . " They 're supposed to call us on the weekends with the drilling report . I spoke with the field engineers right after committee last Wednesday and gave them both our home numbers . " So I had n't screwed up ! " Then who were they reporting to , if not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Should I call the field office or something , and give  | them hell ? You know , ask them why we were n't told what was happening . " " Maybe that would help . I do n't know . But that 's the least of it . " He clamped his teeth together so hard that his jaw muscles bunched , and he looked all about before he spoke . He even cast a little glance back over his shoulder , although the only thing behind him was a blank wall beyond which lay the elevator shaft and other building guts . Then he hissed , " Listen , you notice anything funny about this field ? " He clutched both ends of his mechanical pencil tightly , staring at me with intensity surprising even for Scott , as if he were about to initiate me into some arcane truth . Before I could open my mouth , Scott 's phone rang . He grabbed the receiver , said , " Dinsmoore here . " As he listened to the voice on the other end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He pulled open the lap drawer of his desk , extracted a red spiral-bound notebook , and began writing furiously in a tight little hand . Well , I could n't help but see a little of what was in that notebook ; he had opened it right in front of me , after all . And for all the speed with which he was writing , his handwriting was as obsessively tidy as the rest of him , and with my eyesight I could have read it from at least another ten inches away . It was a desk diary of some sort . The day 's date was neatly inscribed at the top of the page , followed by several lines that appeared to report in some detail what he 'd already done that morning ; who had phoned him ; that sort of stuff . He said , " Yes they are . Yes . I think so too . " In the book , he wrote : " Simon ph. 9/16 13:30 list gas tsts wet , cycing ? " I had only a vague notion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent in the oil patch , the engineers were still coming up with little goodies I did n't understand , and they were always abbreviated out of recognition . I knew what a wet gas was ; gas was rated as wet or dry depending on how much liquid hydrocarbon was dissolved in it . But what was " cycling " ? Scott was saying , " That tears it . Right , I am . Yes , right now . " He hung up , rose abruptly from his chair , and stood at attention beside his desk , as if waiting for me to move before he  | could pass . He said , " Ah , I 've got something I need to do . I was right in not wanting to involve you . " I felt moved to grab him by his tidy little lapels and yank him off the floor , in case that might persuade him to be a little more talkative , but I settled for , " Please , Scott . " An odd light of heroism , either real or imagined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , now quite calm . " It 's not right that you be hurt by this , too . " Smiling faintly , Scott left the room and turned toward Menken 's office . Hurt ? I followed , dawdling in the hallway for a minute , pretending to look at a Bama painting , in hope of at least seeing where he was going in such a hurry . He marched down the hall past the receptionist , right up to the door of Menken 's office , then caved in , stared at his feet , examined his hands . Unless I had just witnessed the final moments of a nervous breakdown , something very important was up . Going in to see Menken was a very bold move for Scott ; he was jumping his own rails , circumventing the chain of command . For a shy , fastidious and painstaking person like Scott , such a brash effort at communication was heroic . But he was a hero with the momentum of a slug . At length , the executive valkyrie that sat outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Menken , phoned ahead for permission , and bade him pass . Scott 's spine stiffened resolutely as he opened the door . I could n't find him later that day ; he had apparently left the office . Tuesday , I was told he was on leave . Meanwhile , I asked Elyria if she knew what Scott 's cryptic note had meant , and she said she did n't know , either , and why ? I said , oh , nothing , and she looked at me knowingly and said she 'd ask around . I told her not to trouble herself . She looked at me huffily . She knew all about keeping things under her hat , she said . I was nervous anyway . I was treading very close to the First Commandment of the oil patch : Thou shalt not discuss proprietary information outside thy company . Late Wednesday afternoon , Scott was back at work . I found him sitting in his barren office , hands folded neatly on his completely empty desk , apparently doing nothing at all . I stepped  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our conversation about Lost Coyote Field . " Yes , I guess so , " he answered , with all the affect of a slice of bread . He showed no signs of breaking out of his trance , save for the faintest twist to one corner of his mouth , as if I had just uttered the name of a vaguely remembered sweetheart who had worn a pleasant perfume . " Scott ? " I prompted , wondering if he were asleep with his eyes open . " Yeah . " " What 's cycling ' ? " He looked up at me , actually smiled . Then he leaned back in his chair and put his feet up on the desk . I was n't ready for his pants . They were a wide , crisp red tartan , quite surprising on a little twitch like Scott . I was floored . His phone rang . He lifted the receiver off the cradle with a light motion , held it delicately to his ear . " Scott Dinsmoore , " he said , his voice serene . When he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak , a smile sprung to his lips , and widened as he spun around in his swivel chair , putting his shoulder toward me . " Certainly , " he said into the phone . He glanced at me , blushing . " Will you excuse me please , Emily ? " Irritated , I left the room . I stood outside in the hall for a few moments , wondering what could have caused such a change in this nervous little man . I remember that it was dark . I was leaving work late , trying to make the big impression , and was shrugging my way into my coat as I crossed the lobby on my way out to Seventeenth Street . Something flicked past my peripheral vision , outside the plate glass windows that lined the lobby . Like something dropping past the windows . As I pushed the door open to the street , I heard a sharp intake of air , and then a full-throated scream .  | The scream went on and on and on . A woman was screaming , right near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She stood with her hands framing her contorted face , fingers stiff like claws . Cars were stopping in the middle of the street . People were converging near her , turning white , turning away , crouching down toward a strange heap of something on the sidewalk . One man moved to the curb and vomited . My eyes saw the heap but my brain would n't compute what it was . It tried several times . To this day I have trouble with it . What was on the sidewalk was , well , sort of like a person , only its parts were lying at funny angles , and it lay in a pool of darkness . It was dressed up like a person too , wearing a blue blazer , and bright red tartan pants . The next thing I remember , I was sitting on a bench in the lobby . I was n't alone on the bench . Peter Tutaraitis was sitting next to me . I felt so dizzy that I leaned forward and put my cheek on one knee . I felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , patiently . Gradually , the buzzing noise in my ears subsided , only to be replaced by the sound of a siren , almost human in its rising and falling complaint against the atrocity that had just occurred . Wa-wa-wa-wa , it shrieked , as it drew up in front of the building , finishing with a perfunctory whump . The spinning lights of a police cruiser swept through the lobby , chasing around its nooks and recesses like crazed swallows . From my sideways view of the world , the policeman who got out seemed to spill from the driver 's seat , hand by his side at the ready , head on a swivel . In three long strides he was out of my line of view , moving toward the body . Moments later , two other cruisers arrived . One quickly backed away from the curb and steered around toward the back of the building .  | An officer stepped into the lobby . " Everyone please hold your positions , " he barked . The words were polite , but the tone was far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find that there were other people in the lobby with us . The woman who had screamed sat at a nearby bench , staring into space . Someone was just stepping off an elevator , and others were milling nearby , trying to get the policeman 's attention . Ignoring their inquiries , he growled : " I 'll see your licenses , please . " He advanced on us , collecting our documents like a ticket taker , brusque yet businesslike . Another elevator dinged and two more people stepped out : J. C. Menken and Dave Smith , the chief engineer . Menken took the scene in at a glance . " What 's going on here , Officer ? " he inquired . The cop moved toward him slowly , concentrating on the dri-ver 's licenses in his hands , shuffling them around like fortune cards . " Your license , sir , " he said . " My what ? Look here , Officer , what 's going on ? " Dave Smith had already set his attache case on the floor and was reaching for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some identification , J.C. , " he said , soothingly . " Seems there 's been some kind of a little problem outside the building here , and the officer just needs to keep track of everybody . " He handed over his license , nodding to the cop as man to man . " I 'm sure there 'll just be a short delay , J.C. , and as soon as this good man gets things sorted out , why then we can just get along to dinner . " Menken affected regal annoyance . Setting his attache down , he produced his license , held it up for the cop to examine . " There . Now , we have reservations at the Broker Restaurant , and we 're late as it is . " The cop plucked the license from Menken 's hand with surprising delicacy for such a burly man . " You 'll have to wait with the others , sir . Sorry . " I was distracted from the rest of their exchange by more arrivals outside . A Fire Department pumper pulled up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out and made their way over the yellow tape barrier that now enclosed the sidewalk and the cars parked along it . When I returned my attention to  | the big cop , he was standing just a few feet away from us . Another officer came inside and reported to him . " Everything secured outside , Sergeant , sir , " she said , producing a pad of paper from her pocket . " The building 's got three routes of egress . " She whipped a pen out of her breast pocket , pointed to the features on her drawing . " This one here " ? she gestured to the front doors ? " a loading dock , and the parking garage . Garage has two doors into it , staircase and elevator . There 's a man on the vehicular exit at Welton , you know , taking parking fees . The vehicular entrance is right next to it , so like he sits between the two in his glass booth . Guy says two cars came out in the last ten minutes , both monthly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the specs here ; he had the tag numbers , so forth . There 's a couple pedestrian exits , one on Welton , one on Glenarm . The guy can see the one on Welton , says no customers . Glenarm he ca n't see ; no dice . The dock is locked with a dead bolt ; no witnesses to make sure no one left by key , but we got her covered now . Janitors say no one has a key but them . You can get to it from the staircase into the garage , up a flight , or you know , down from above and all , or from I guess that door . Yeah . " She pointed to a heavy steel fire door beyond the elevator bank . " Fairmont Hotel 's the other building to the northeast . They got their own entrances and all ; you know what it looks like . Harland 's back there questioning the doorman on duty now . " An ambulance pulled up in front of the building , lights flashing . The med techs from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who got out and wandered amiably toward them anyway . The sergeant laconically observed the new arrival before turning back to the reporting officer . " Homicide been called , right ? " " Yes , sir , and the M.E. " " Deceased 's name ? " " License in wallet says Harold Scott Dinsmoore , sir . Business card same name , Petroleum Engineer , Blackfeet Oil Company , this address , suite twelve hundred . So twelfth floor , but looks like he came out a few floors higher . "  | " Last week 's jumper came out of sixteen . " " Yes , sir . Looks like the same , window . Was n't repaired yet . There 's some plywood splinters caught in the back of his jacket . " " Jones , you do n't have to call me sir ' all the time . I 'm only a sergeant , after all . Relax . You sound like a rookie . Just ' cause you 're a rookie do n't mean you have to sound like a rookie . " " Certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yes . " She caught herself before she said " sir " again . " Okay , looks like we got everything buttoned up then . Soon as Homicide gets here , they 'll probably need you and a couple of the others for a search upstairs . " " Right , sir . " Another car pulled up in what now looked like a showcase for official vehicles . Two men in business suits got out . One was short and rather round , and the other tall , bony and muttfaced . As they moved toward the lump on the sidewalk , everyone stepped out of their way . The short one took a fairly quick look , spoke briefly with the uniformed officer who was standing by , and passed through the lobby to the elevators . Menken was pacing up and back in the center of the lobby . Smith stood characteristically still , watching him pace . Menken said , " We 're wasting time here . This is just another one of these damned suicide cases . " Smith 's face was impassive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perhaps , sir , but it 's one of your employees this time . " " What ? Who ? " Menken stopped pacing . Smith peered out the window . " I believe it 's Scott . Dinsmoore , J.C. , " he said , his voice the only animation in his motionless body . Menken drew back . His face stiffened into a mask . " Dins-moore ? " The two men stared at each other with no discernable emotion for perhaps ten seconds before Menken reorganized his features into an expression of dismay and said , " This is most shocking . We 'll have to make the proper gesture to the family . " " Of course . " Another pause . " Will we have to replace him ? "  | " I do n't think so . No , I 'm pretty sure the rest of the engineering staff can pick up the few chores he was performing . " Menken 's face fell into an expression of mild brooding . Presently he looked over at me , as if he expected me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my throat . How could they speak of the dead so casually ? I noticed then that Blackfeet 's receptionist was over by the elevator bank smoking a cigarette . She was a pale , pretty thing , with that rare , luminous , porcelain skin which at the moment seemed almost transparent . She stood staring toward Pete and me , pulled up against the wall as if claiming shelter from a high wind , her tiny little open-toed shoes drawn close together . She was frowning , the most emotion I 'd seen her display to date . This time , her stomach seemed plenty steady . There were other familiar faces now in the lobby : Fred Crick , my phantom boss ; Irma Triff , Menken 's executive secretary ; and Jon Hathaway , the financial manager . I was beginning to recover enough to wonder why so many people had stayed so late . Bursts of light came from outside . Someone was taking flash pictures of the scene on the sidewalk ; the tall bony plainclothes cop . A second was crouched down , tying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third was hauling gear out of a small van that had two red spotlights and a police antenna . Tall Bony put away the camera , blew his nose , got out a pad of paper and a pencil , and started sketching a picture of the scene . The Rembrandt of the macabre . Pete said , " I wonder how long this is going to take . Seems like a lot of fuss for a suicide . " The sergeant observed him askance . " How do you know it 's a suicide , Mr. ah ? " He shuffled through the licenses , looking for Pete 's . " Toot-o-ray ... " I watched for Pete to react to the mispronunciation of his name , like Maddie had suggested . But he did n't . He looked downright sociable , like the cop was some old boy just dropped around for a beer , and how are ya ? He cheerfully corrected the cop 's attempt . " Tutaraitis . Well , I do n't know it 's a suicide , of course . It 's just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He smiled . " You got me on that one . Here I 'm a scientist , and I 'm supposed to know better than to make assump-tions . " " Are you acquainted with the deceased ? " asked the sergeant . " I do n't know . Who is the deceased ? " Pete asked . " His name is Scott Dinsmoore . You know him , Mr. Toot aritis ? " Pete 's face fell . " It 's Scottie ? Shit , I did n't realize . Oh , that must sound very callous of me . I 'm sorry . " Pete looked at his hands , fluttering them about . " Good God . Scottie 's dead . You ca n't be serious . " I wondered whether it was his turn to be getting shocky or faint . " Then you did know him . How well ? " " Why , we worked together , right here at Blackfeet Oil . It 's up on the twelfth floor ; I was just coming from there . I just saw Scott a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd gone home . " " Exactly when did you last see him ? " " Oh , I do n't know , about four or five . Really , that 's Scott Dinsmoore out there ? " About then the little round detective returned from his visit upstairs , flagged his partner in from the sidewalk , and everything got real regimented and organized , real fast . As uniformed officers fanned out for a search of the building , the two detectives sorted out everyone in the lobby and questioned us , quickly and efficiently , sending each home in turn . Those of us from Blackfeet were questioned somewhat more extensively , each taken out of earshot of the others . My turn came with the little round detective . He walked me away from the dwindling group . " Hi there , " he said . " I 'm Sergeant Ortega . I 'll just be asking you a few questions here . First , your name please . " " Em Hansen . " " Spell that please ? " He smiled at me from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confusion , or curiosity perhaps . His voice was soft , slightly whispery , with just a trace of an Hispanic accent . It was something in the vowels , and in the way he pronounced each word very deliberately . " Hansen . H-A-N-S-E-N . " " No , I mean the M. ' "  | Outside , the ambulance and pumper departed , and a van arrived , marked " M &; M Removal Service . " " The M ? " " Miss Hansen ? Miss ? How do you spell that first name ? " " E-M . It 's short for Emily . " " Ohhh , I get it . Okay . " Sergeant Ortega smiled his warm round smile , then squinted up at me again . " I 'm sorry for staring , but you look familiar somehow . I 'm sorry . I do n't mean to be rude . " " It 's okay . " I guessed it was okay , anyway . I really did n't have any room to complain , under the circumstances , and he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starting to feel kind of woozy again . I stared helplessly out at the scene on the side-walk . " Okay . Okay . Now , Miss Hansen . I understand that you work at Blackfeet Oil , like ah , Mr. Dinsmoore . Is that right ? " The men from M &; M Removal were hauling a stretcher out of the back of their van . One was unfolding a big plastic bag . Sergeant Ortega touched me lightly on the shoulder , turning me so that I faced him , my back to the windows that looked onto the street . " That 's better . I 'll repeat my question , okay ? " " Yeah . No , it 's okay . Um , I just came to work here a week ago . " " Oh , okay , okay . Very sad for you , to come to work just now . Very upsetting . Where did you work before here ? " " I worked for a mudlogging contractor out of Casper , Wyoming . I was on drilling rigs , mostly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Very big sky . Now , are you a  --  what , mudlogger for Blackfeet ? " " No , now I 'm a geologist . " " I see . Now , where were you when the deceased ah  --  died ? " I felt a vein start pulsing in my forehead . " Right here , I guess . I was just coming out of the elevator when ... " " Right . Okay . So you were here inside the lobby . " " Yeah . " " And you saw Mr. Dinsmoore , ah  --  land . " " Yeah ? " " Oh , you did n't see it ? "  | " No , I saw something , but urn , I ... " My ears began to ring again . " What did you see ? " " It was kind of like something just came by the windows . " " What did it look like ? Can you describe it ? " " It was , well ? " I made a few gestures , trying to explain the inexplicable . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ortega nodded . " And then what ? " " Then . . . urn , I 'm not sure . Then , well , I 'm sitting on the bench here , and Pete  --  Mr. Tutaraitis  --  is with me , and there are other people here . " " Were they here when you came out of the elevator ? " " I do n't ? " The picture this questioning was painting began to dawn on me . He was asking me to report on other members of my company . I could just hear the whispering that would set off in the coffee room . I reflexively drew back , like a calf bolting from a cowboy 's hands as he tries to corner it against a fence to brand it . " I do n't remember . " " How long do you suppose it was between the time you saw what you saw and the time you were sitting on the bench ? " " I do n't know . " How long had it been ? A moment ? Several minutes ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sergeant Ortega scribbled little notes on a pad of paper . He smiled again . " Right ! So you were in here , and all that was out there . Got it ! " He sounded so cheerful , and his smile was so sweet , that I found myself concentrating very hard on what he was saying , waiting for each soft word to come out of his mouth . " And , um , when was the last time you saw Mr. Dinsmoore alive ? " " Early this afternoon . He was in his office . I stopped in to speak with him . " " Okay . And , how did he seem to you ? You know , mood . " " Weird . " He scribbled . " How so , weird ? " I fought the urge to start spilling the whole story . This guy was easy to talk to , and I sure needed to talk ; but I was n't going to do it here , with my boss and all my co-workers , not to men-  | tion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a long walk on a country road , so I could tell him . Sergeant Ortega smiled again , with a certain tenderness . I had to say something . " Well , sir , I did n't know him hardly at all , just a week , you see , or nine days , to be exact , but always before he was  --  well , a real tense sort of guy . He got tenser and tenser until today , and then he seemed all of a sudden real relaxed , almost like he was sleepwalking . Kind of cheerful . " I hurried the words out , hoping that would do . It did n't work . Sergeant Ortega seemed very interested in this , and questioned me further about what I 'd said , and what Scott had said . He was so sweet and solicitous that I felt like shit telling him I could n't really remember anything particular that was said . I did go so far as to give him my opinion , on prompting , about whether or not I thought Scott @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best ; I 've never known anyone who committed suicide , at least not all at once like that , and so who was Ito know ? But I went ahead and said my piece anyway , stating that I thought Scott was more angry than despairing . Hurray for Em Hansen , amateur shrink . I was embarrassed when I got to thinking about it later on , but at the time , it made me feel better to talk , it really did . About then the stairwell door whanged open and a very strange man stumbled out into the lobby , hunched over as if he were one hundred and eighty years old . It took me a moment to realize that this was not a feeble old drunk , it was a perfectly sober man being goose-walked by a cop , who came through the door behind him . I realized with a shock that the man was hardly any older than I was ; the effect of age was caused by his posture , and the grizzle of a three-day growth of beard . Wildly colored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army greatcoat . He was bending forward so far that the front hem of the coat swept the floor . " Look who I found in the parking garage , Sarge , " said the cop , his sloppy face spreading into a foolish grin . Sergeant Ortega nodded patiently . " Very nice , Stanlon . Now , you may release him . " The cop 's face sagged into a dull frown as he dropped the  | man 's arm . Shrugging , he stepped back . The man painfully straightened his arm around to his side and rubbed it . " Sar-geant ! " he sang , breaking into a lunatic smile . Ortega 's face brightened . " Archie Arch . My man . Long time ; I thought you must of left town . So . What were you doing in the garage this evening , my friend ? " Archie swayed gently from the knees and brought his shoulders coyly to his earlobes . " Okay . Okay , I 'll get to you later . Go visit Floyd , okay ? " Archie smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do n't get lost , " Ortega called after him . When he returned his attention to me , he said , " Nice guy . Makes nice poems . " Sergeant Ortega wrapped up the interview by asking me where I could be reached that evening . I gave him Elyria 's number . He paused after writing it down . " Where is this number lo-cated ? " " On West Thirtieth Avenue , near Oceola . " " Ohhh , okay . Now I know where I seen you before . You live with Elyria Kretzmer , right near my parents . " " The house by the corner ? I thought I 'd seen a police cruiser there . " " No , that 's my little brother , Norberto . He 's uniform . I 'm the detective . " Ortega smiled , merry and proud , then raised his eyebrows . " Yes , that Elyria , she 's one fine lady . And very pretty . " That 's an understatement , I thought haughtily . " Yeah . She 's nice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can reach you at Elyria 's then , this evening , if I have any more questions ? " " Yeah . " And that was it . Except that Pete Tutaraitis drove me home . I had thought Pete might come in , but when he pulled his Saab up in front of the house , he said , " Oh , you 're staying at Elyria 's ? "  | " Yeah . You know Elyria ? " " Sure . I used to see her at the company Christmas parties , when Bill was alive . Besides , everybody in the business knows Elyria . Bright lady . " He moved to put the car in first gear . " Can you come in ? " I asked . " No . Better get home . " He looked at his watch . " I had n't realized how late it was getting . " He flashed me a very nice smile , added , " Rain check , okay ? " and then , " You sure you 'll be all right ? " " Yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my head felt heavy again . I lowered it into my hands . Pete put his arms around me and held me against his chest , and I fell into warmth and masculine smells of tweed and dayold shirt . Tears burned my eyes . Without thinking about it , I slid my arms in between his shirt and his jacket . A shirt button pressed against my nose . The warm , firm muscle that lay so close beneath the fine white pinpoint cotton was deeply comforting , but at the same time , added to my confusion . He murmured , " It 's okay , Emily , it 's okay . " The awkwardness of stretching across the space between the seats soon brought me back to my senses . Finding myself so cozy with a near stranger , I shot upright . Abruptly , he leaned across me , opened my door , smiled , and said , " See you around the rodeo , Cisco . " I hopped out and stood shivering under the streetlights , even though I felt quite warm . " Sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workmates kept gravitating into the coffee room , where they stood around with their shoulders hunched over their cups , like so many cold , wet birds waiting for bad weather to pass . They sucked up their coffee slowly , hesitant to leave their fellows and return to their lonely offices . There were three classes of people in the place that day : Those Who Were There When It Happened ; Those Who Were n't ; and then me , The New One to Whom We Do n't Speak . Maddie took everything in with a straighter face than usual , and did n't comment . She had n't heard about Scott 's death un-  | til she arrived in the building that morning ; otherwise , just maybe , she would n't have worn red . Menken called us into the conference room in groups , and gave us the news we already knew . He informed us that we should cooperate fully with the police  --  who were for some reason beyond his powers of rational understanding not yet satisfied that Scott 's death was a suicide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff , just background information , do n't worry  --  but of course , the company policy regarding proprietary information was to be honored . The company would be holding a memorial service on Monday morning , at St. Andrew 's Episcopal down on Broadway , the receptionist would give details . Scott 's remains would be returned to Albany , New York , for interment in the family burial plot . An expression of sympathy for the family was being made on behalf of the company . Any questions , see Dave Smith . Sergeant Ortega poked his head in my door at about ten . " Good morning , " he said . " I have a few more questions for you , okay ? " " Urn ? " Maddie went on point . Ortega nodded to her in a pleasant , mannerly way . I was n't sure what to do . I wanted to do my civic duty , but perhaps the Eau de Police Informant would n't do much to improve my already questionable welcome at Blackfeet . I defaulted to good manners . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Madeline . " Maddie began to show some spirit , rolling her eyes at my introduction . Ortega bowed to Maddie with grave courtesy , then gave her one of his best smiles . He turned back to me . " Well , okay now , " he said , pulling the spare chair up across the desk from me . He pulled out his little pad and made a show of getting a pen from his inside jacket pocket , sweeping it out with a flourish . " Mr. Menken here says you and Mr. Dinsmoore were working on the same project . Can you tell me something about that ? " It was clear that the sergeant did n't know the first thing  | about the oil business , namely that special knowledge is invaluable . Work is simply not discussed with outsiders , unless there is something to be gained by leaking certain bits of information , and even then only selected details would be divulged . If I sat here and chirped away to the first outsider who came along ? someone whose notes might become a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hang up the hope of ever becoming an insider . I glanced over at Maddie . She was staring with her usual candor . Ortega beamed a smile at her , even went so far as to wave . She nodded back , held her pose . He cleared his throat , with gusto . She smiled , beatifically . Ortega crooned , " Perhaps we could use the conference room , Miss Hansen , so Madeline " ? he sang her name and bowed deeply toward her ? " can get some work done . " He smiled shyly , as if he were asking me down to the soda shop for a malt . Oh , perfect : I 'll just go behind closed doors with the guy . Now everyone can speculate on what was said , get fully paranoid . I gave Ortega a smile designed to look like my mouth was full of wet plaster . Ortega rose to his feet . I heaved a sigh and followed him down the hall , figuring I 'd strike a balance between cooperation and conservatism , so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be questioned again . As we trooped down that hard beige hallway , we passed through the scrutiny of several geologists and engineers , two secretaries , and a technician . They examined us with brooding eyes , silently marking our passage , staring darkly over their coffee mugs . I 'll admit that once we were in the conference room with that door shut , curiosity got the better of me , and I said , " This was suicide , right ? " " These are just some routine questions , " Ortega said , not answering my question . That sparked a pang of jealousy . Damn it , Iwanted to be asking the questions . Ortega took a seat at the big table and made a show of settling in , making it clear that he could and would outwait any at-  | tempt to withhold information . So what the hell : I stated in matter-of-fact tones that yes , I was working on the same field Scott had , and was having minor problems with it , mostly because I was so new . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And like you told me last night , you knew the deceased for only ten days ? " Ortega asked . " Nine . I can probably name each time I laid eyes on him . " I thought this would sound extremely earnest and get me off the hot seat . " Try me . " Ortega smiled and sat poised to drink up my words , like I was the Oracle herself snorting fumes at Delphi . So I told him what I knew of Scottie , short of speculation on the significance of his tartan pants . I described how Scottie had behaved each time I met him , without quite telling him how that reflected on company business . I described his nervousness at the committee meeting , his histrionics over the morning report , his secretiveness over the phone call he 'd gotten from the mysterious Simon , his march down to Menken 's office on Monday , and his odd behavior around the call on Wednesday afternoon . I slipped up a little by mentioning that Scott kept a desk diary in a red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it or that it would n't mean anything to them , any more than it had to me . When I got out of my chair at the end of the interview , I smiled confidently , relieved that this would be my last discussion with the good sergeant . And a tiny bit disappointed . " Okay , thanks , Emily , " he said . " See you around . " " Around , sir ? " " The neighborhood . " " The what ? " He laughed . " We 're sort of neighbors , remember ? On West Thirtieth . Welcome to the barrio . " At eleven , Pete phoned me at my desk : " Hi , Emily . Can your stomach handle lunch after your little chat with the Gold Dust twins ? " " Who ? "  | " Officers Mutt and Jeff . " " I got just the one ; how do you rate ? " " Perhaps because . . . , " he paused for greater significance , " I do n't have . . . an alibi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir . " " So ; lunch with a wanted man ? " " Just one moment , please , I must check with Mizz Hansen 's social calendar . " I thought I was joking , but my desk calendar announced , " Brown Palace 11:30 . " The dreaded Boston Brahmin Memorial Lunch . I had so happily forgotten . " Damn . Um , sorry , not today . Got a command performance with some old acquaintances from school . " " Curse the luck . Ah , well , if the old school tie binds , I shall dine alone . " Pete laughed deliciously as he hung up the phone . The thought of consuming a meal with Topsy Warren and friends gave me gas . I had sworn , upon graduating from prep school , that I would never trouble myself to see them again . But here I was , once again doing what my grandmother expected of me . What a wimp , I thought , as the elevator coughed me out at the street-level lobby . I stepped out into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of blue sky overhead . Deep shadows accentuated the canyonlike walls of the skyscrapers that had been tossed up along Seventeenth Street during the building boom of the early eighties , when Canadian investment money had flowed across the border in search of greener pastures . Scores of offices still lay empty , their blank windows hanging over the street like gaping maws , mute testimony to a recession in the global economy that reached far beyond commodities . I looked up Seventeenth Street toward the Platte River , wishing I were heading that way , instead of toward lunch with people I was sure , like me , would rather skip it . I could n't quite see Union Station , where the street begins . The street rises from the station like an architectural history lesson , passing between Victorian brick hotels , turn-of-the-century stone massifs , and fifties low-rises , to the **26;0;TOOLONG behemoths of  | the eighties . The Cattlemen 's Exchange Building loomed over my head , its copper-tinted windows reflecting the traffic and opposite buildings at street level and the sky high above . Oneway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a canyon , sluicing toward its confluence with Broadway , where a thirty-six-story steel obelisk of offices split the stream with its sharp-edged geometry . I turned toward the Brown Palace Hotel and urged myself to move . My feet dragged as if they were made of lead , much as I love that beautiful old hotel . It boggled my imagination that these classmates were here in Denver . This little cow town was n't half classy enough for then , even if they were still in the beginning of the big career climb . Why had n't their family connections bought them into Boston , or New York ? Topsy Warren . I cringed at the thought of listening to her nasal laugh while I tried to swallow lunch . Rachel Conant . She had always been too preoccupied with the boys at Phillips Academy to give me much trouble . Not the little social-climbing shit-stirrer that Topsy was . But very well connected , so why is she here ? And Libby Hopkins ? I was in fact glad Libby might be there . Libby was separate ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . I remembered her as one of the few girls at school who never felt the need to put me in my place . Why would Libby Hopkins take a job as far away from the social hub of the universe as Denver ? Certainly , she never had to take a job at all . Just then , I caught a glimpse of myself in the glass front of another building . All I saw was one more businessperson in a pack of businesspeople that stalked the Denver pavement like so many carnivores on the veldt . Who was this person who stared back at me ? This was n't a geologist , it was just a scared little girl in her grannie 's tweeds , the twisted result of an ill-planned breeding experiment , in which the offspring has neither the thoroughbred lines of the dam , nor the easy temperament of the sire . As I stared into my reflection in the glass , I saw something that scared me senseless : I was starting to look like my grand-  | mother . As this shock rang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the realization that the ghost of my inheritance had invaded my bones . It only strengthened the resem-blance . I spun around and stared across the street , hoping I could somehow escape , but there I was again , my reflection distorted in three different panes of glass . Mercifully , someone stepped between me and my reflections . Pete Tutaraitis . Sauntering down the sidewalk on the opposite side of the street . I matched his progress on my side of the street , watching him , wishing I were walking with him instead of dragging myself alone to lunch with the ghosts of prep school past . Pete turned the corner at Tremont Place . I stopped and watched , still in no hurry to reach the Brown Palace . About a block down , a man stepped out from a doorway and athletically matched Pete 's stride , moving up next to him . He was more broad-shouldered and taller than Pete , wore a similar sort of suit jacket and slacks , and had blond hair . Catching up with Pete , he grabbed him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips moving in earnest conversation . Pete turned and stopped , his body English shouting of anger . I was startled ; it had n't occurred to me until that moment that anything could move Pete to rage . The man pulled at Pete 's arm , trying to drag him along . Pete held his ground . The man raised his hands and started backing away down the sidewalk , and judging by his gestures , saying something derogatory . Then he turned and stalked angrily away . Pete followed , caught up and walked close to him , as if he did n't want passersby to hear what he was saying . The Brown Palace Hotel is a very special place , a Denver landmark , the grand gathering place of all the old silver kings  | and railroad barons . My father used to take me there for lunch , a special treat when we came south for the annual Stock Show . It was built in 1892 by Henry C. Brown , on a plot of land where he used to graze his cow . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it stands at that place where Denver 's streets make a forty-five-degree turn to accommodate the clash between two camps of founding developers , one of which thought Denver should align itself with the banks of the Platte River , and the other of which adhered to the north-south-east-west orthodoxy of the Great Plains . The hotel 's architecture is handsome and opulent , eight floors of red sandstone and granite Italian Renaissance splendor rising majestically from the very heart of Denver . Inside , the bright Colorado sunlight filters down through a stained-glass roof onto the seven floors of balconies , ornate cast-iron grillwork , and white onyx pillars that line the atrium lobby . How I used to tip back my head and stare . Today I was trying to look blase . Topsy was waiting in the lobby , her indelicate bulk cranked sideways a bit as she peered into one of the illuminated display boxes that advertised the fine shops housed around the street level of the hotel . " Emmy , " she said , straightening up to give me a tiny peck on the cheek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back in Boston . It 's so nice having a few people from the real world show up out here . I 'd lose my mind if Rachel and Libby were n't here . Really . I mean , Denver is trying to be a real city , but you know . Oh , here 's Rachel ; what timing . Raaaachel , " she cooed , rushing up and pressing an awkward hug onto Rachel 's uninterested body . Rachel disengaged from Topsy 's embrace and brushed back a lock of her perfect , chocolate-brown hair . She said , " Em . Nice to see you . Libby wo n't be joining us . She 's still away . " No smiles . Vintage Rachel . I felt gratified when she raised an eyebrow ever so slightly at my new appearance . We crossed the lobby to the Ship Tavern , and at Rachel 's command were seated at the center of the room , near the massive ship 's mast that holds up the timbered ceiling . I gazed longingly at the antique ship models ; my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch the one over the door . But to-  | day I was here on business , and trying to be an adult , whatever that was . While we examined the menu , Topsy chatted about how boring the Colorado autumn was , next to good old New England ; how she missed the marvelous reds and oranges of the sugar maples , how the locals here did go on about the aspen gold , when all she could see was plain , boring yellow . Rachel was n't listening , apparently preoccupied with some young buck at the bar . When the waiter materialized to take our orders , she said , " The trout . White wine , " without shifting her gaze . " Oh , yes , does n't that sound marvelous , " Topsy exulted . " Good idea . I 'll have that , too . " " Mmm , yes , I have n't had trout since last month , in Yellow-stone , " I said , feeling a little blasphemous for contorting my fishing trips with decent , straightforward Frank into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I added , as if they knew the difference . Then I glanced at the price of this trout . Fifteen dollars . I considered ordering a buffalo burger with Swiss cheese instead , but my pride could n't wait until I had a few paychecks under my belt . Somewhere over the salad course Topsy 's conspiratorial lament about the horrors of cow town living broadened to the surrounding territories , and she asked me , " Surely you understand , Emmy . You lived out west somewhere before school , did n't you ? Where was it , Minnesota ? Or was it Wisconsin or something ? " " Wyoming . The other W ' state . " " Oh , right . That 's north of here , right ? " " Yeah . " It 's the next state , dipshit , and if you hate cows . . . Struggling to keep my temper down , I changed the subject . " So , where are you guys working ? " Topsy answered for both . " I 'm a buyer for the Denver Dry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Bergdorf 's , or some other New York store . Soon . When I 'm ready . Rachel 's working for the governor at the state capitol until her husband " ? she said the word with an odd , perhaps jealous zest , pointedly mimicking Rachel 's steady gaze toward the bar ? " gets promoted  | back out of here . Her dad got her the job . You remember , he 's a senator . Connections ; right , Rachel ? " Rachel did n't reply . Her quarry at the bar war answering with a steady , loaded stare . She appeared not to notice as the waiter expertly set her entree down in front of her . " You like your work , Rachel ? " I asked : " Yes . " " What 's your husband do ? " " Merrill Lynch . " Topsy continued her dissertation : " Libby does n't work , of course . For money , I mean ; she does charity work for the art museum when she 's here . Like Rachel , she 's only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention veered back to Rachel . " So where 's Libby gotten herself to this time , Rachel ? Back east with Mum and Daddy again ? Getting tired of her husband ? " Topsy ripped off one of her nasal laughs and forked some trout into her mouth . " So Emmy , you 're doing something with the oil business ? I forget what Mother said . " As I opened my mouth to reply , Topsy suddenly grabbed Rachel 's shoulder . " Oh , Rachel ! The oil business ! I almost forgot to tell you ! Did you hear that Scott Dinsmoore died last night ? " Rachel 's brow furrowed . Slowly , her gaze shifted to the tablecloth , and then to the end of Topsy 's nose . When she finally spoke , her words came out small and wistful : " Scottie ? What happened ? " I said , " You guys knew ? " but Topsy cut across my words . " Marcie Jacobson phoned last night late from Virginia to tell me . She heard from Scottie 's sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set down my fork , my stomach sinking . Rachel looked irritated , disconsolate ; like she was being awakened from sleep with a hangover . " Scottie ? " she whispered . Topsy slapped a hand across her mouth in horror . " Rachel ! I forgot ! You used to date him , did n't you ? " A look of sulking irritation weighted Rachel 's flawless face . " I 'd hardly call it that . I tired of him rather quickly . " She glanced at me . My face must have shown my horror , because she quickly added , " The poor sap . I had n't seen him in months . "  | " You 'll never believe how he did it , " said Topsy . My trout came to life again , thrashing in my stomach like it had just been hooked . I said , " Hey listen , guys ? " " He went out that sixteenth-floor window of the building that Gerry what's-his-name went out last week . Oh ! " She slapped her hand over her mouth again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulder . " They knew each other , did n't they ? Do you suppose there 's a connection ? " Rachel 's reply was tart . " No . One fool committing suicide is happenstance , two is coincidence , three is perversion . " " Well . Anyway , he was dead on arrival at Denver General ? " " Topsy , I 'm eating ! " Rachel snapped . Even as my stomach turned on edge , my mind whirred with questions : how did they know Scott Dinsmoore , and Gerald Luftweiller , for that matter ? And just what was the connection between them ? Topsy stared morbidly at her trout , enraptured by the drama of the situation . " We have to tell Libby , do n't we . " It was a statement , not a question . Rachel signaled the waiter for the check , so forcefully that he all but slid up to the table like a runner making home plate . Rachel pulled a five and a ten out of her pocketbook , slapped it onto the check , rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one cool motion . She smoothed her skirt , staring levelly at Topsy . " I forgot . I have a meeting . Em , nice to see you . We 'll have lunch again sometime . " She left the restaurant , with the barest glance toward the bar . Two heartbeats later , Mr. Interesting glanced theatrically at his watch and excused himself from his companions , abandoning a full beer . Topsy hunched her head down between her meaty shoulders . " Do you think she 's upset about something ? " she asked . I chose not to dignify her question with an answer , instead concentrating on the check : forty-five dollars and change ; with tip , it would be something over fifty . Rachel had pulled the old preppie stunt of ordering the most and then dividing the tab in even thirds , this time not even accounting for the tip . Glowering , I pulled out a twenty . My dear classmates always did have a way of spending my money for me.  | On another channel , my mind was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the jigsaw puzzle . What Topsy had just said did n't jibe with a statement Scott had made in the coffee room chatter that first day : he had said he did not know the man who had jumped . On the way out to the street , I tried to pump Topsy for information about Scott and Gerald Luftweiller . She did n't say much , except that they had all known each other in college , " after we knew Scottie at school . " When I looked blank on that one , she screwed up her face and stared at me , appalled at my ignorance . " Come now ; you remember Scottie and Rachel . " She turned her gaze down Broadway , toward the Sixteenth Street Mall , where a shuttle bus was just squealing up to the stop . " Oh , damn it , there 's my shuttle . " " Was he at Phillips Academy ? " I asked . It was the obvious guess . " No , Holderness . " Her tone suggested dismissal . Digging down for my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , I do n't remember him . " " I 've got to go , Emmy ; we can catch up on social things another time . " Her tone was now decidedly condescending . Topsy never had been capable of sustained subtlety . As the light changed , she stepped off the curb , her square hips lurching as she lengthened her stride . I clenched my teeth together , trying not to say what I was thinking . Okay , so you got yourself snubbed ; must you pass it on to me ? Anger rising in my throat , I called , " Speak into the mike , Topsy ; when would I have met Scott ? " Topsy did n't break stride . As another bus hove into view , she accelerated into an ungainly trot I had n't seen since our last game of field hockey senior year . Over her shoulder she hollered , " The dances . You know . " The dances I did n't know . I had managed to miss most of those insufferable dances with the boys ' schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hiding in the stables . Having my horse with me at school had been the thing that made those years bearable . I stood in the mile-high Denver sunlight , remembering the A Sarah Andrews  | darkness of my prep school 's stables where I 'd hide , cuddling Gypsy 's wonderful arching neck , trying not to get my best dress smelling like horse . That had been long ago and far away . I tried to assure myself that I was a grown woman now , free to come and go as I wished . But deep inside , I was acutely aware that I was once again dressed up in pretty clothes that would bind me if I tried to run . The concrete sidewalk was hard under my feet as I stalked back up Seventeenth Street . I stopped short of the entrance to the Cattlemen 's Exchange Building and leaned back , tipping my head to search for the openness of the sky , but clouds slid by on an autumn wind , giving the weird impression that the building was falling forward , rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked , Why go back to this non job ? I did n't have a viable answer . Traffic ground by behind me , filling the air with its din . For a moment , I teetered on the brink of aiming my feet toward the bus station and heading home , wherever that was . My left hand floated west , a precursor to turning . One of Blackfeet 's engineers came into view , closing fast from uptown . I squinted at her , trying to remember her name . Angie ? A glint of recognition shot through her eyes , too , but she quickly looked away . As Angie swept past me in her musky perfume and silk , I followed her , hurrying through the doorway in an effort to stay close . Pride had once again overwhelmed fear : at least this day I would continue as planned . If I ever did back down , disappearing back into the prairie like a wounded coyote , I would do it without witnesses . Upstairs in the coffee room , I found a klatsch of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , they abruptly ended their conversation and just stared at me , un-  | smiling . Ignoring them as best I could , I poured a mug and headed to my desk , my grip so tight my knuckles turned white . How I 'd envied the geologists and engineers who had come out to the drill rigs to " slum it " and take a break from office routine . For nearly five years , I had existed in the lowest strata of the oil business , avoiding rejection , not daring to seek work as a geologist , never admitting even to myself how dearly I coveted the authority and self-confidence that seemed to come with the job . Even when Menken had thrown this job in my lap , I 'd put him off for months . But in the end , Frank had pressed me to give the job a try . " You got machinery you 've never used , " he 'd said . " You 'll always wonder what you missed . Maybe you 'll start feeling sorry you stayed . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your system , Em , then come back to me . " Just now " back " seemed painfully far away . After downing that cup of coffee , I phoned the field office at Lost Coyote to knock a few heads over the fact that I was still having to consult the daily reports to get any information on the drilling . No one answered . The rest of that day crawled by . Nothing I put my eyes to made sense . I tried to read some on the Mesozoic sandstones of Wyoming , the better to understand the vagaries of Lost Coyote Field , but over and again I found that I had read whole pages without absorbing a single word . The mind of a geologist does not think in a straight line . It 's a frustrating thing , given to long periods of anxiety-ridden data-gathering followed by the rare but breathtaking leap of intuition . If I could grasp the geometry of the sandstone  --  distance and thickness and quality and repetition of pattern  --  and embrace them all at once , I would know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production of oil and gas . Then I would have something . Then I could march into the committee room and say Pay attention , boys and girls , I have the answer . But no such understanding came . I kept staring at a drawing in one article that illustrated the sequence of rock layers in the neighborhood of the field , from surface down to the bottom of  | the Mesozoic-aged strata . It was drawn like a column , showing alternating layers of sandstone , shale , sandstone , shale , sandstone , and shale , ad nauseam . An uneven layer cake made of grit . Even less enlightening was the electrical log printed next to the rock column . As a petroleum geologist , I was supposed to be able to glance at an E-log and " see " the rock column that had produced it ; but much as I stared , the E-log was still just a wiggly line to me . I tried to imagine myself in the oil field , standing by the wellhead on the drilling rig as the boys from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cable down thousands of feet of bore hole , their massive winch humming with the effort . The boys always cursed and worried and ate too many doughnuts , afraid the sensor would snag on a rough spot in the hole . They 'd get the gadget on bottom and then climb into the air-conditioned electronics parlor in the back of their truck and tune their recording instruments , like so many wizards making sure their magic toad 's foot was working . Then they 'd reverse the winch and slowly draw the sensor back up the hole , data flowing up the cable and into their computer by the megabyte . Many a time I had hung out and mooched their coffee , watching the pen sway left and right on the CRT monitor as the enormous winch slowly wound the cable back up into daylight . Or starlight , as the case may be . A rig runs around the clock . I knew that if I could get good at working with the E-logs , I could recognize one rock formation from another at a glance , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to correlate a single sandstone layer from one well to the next clear across a field . I could lay the logs out next to each other and say Ah , yes , this well is good , but see here ? The sand pinches out before we get to this well , over here . But today I threw down my pen in frustration . One wiggle still looked just like another to me . For all I knew , I would be correlating a sandstone to a limestone . I left at four-thirty sharp , the earliest instant I could leave with dignity . The bus ride home was the usual exercise in culture shock . I tripped on a crack in the sidewalk as I approached the house . When I found a note from Elyria on the kitchen  | counter saying she had been called away to New Orleans , my day was complete . Feeling supremely sorry for myself , I pulled a tortilla out of the refrigerator and tossed it onto a burner on the stove to heat while I chased into the bathroom for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in flames . I flipped it into the sink with a pair of tongs , switched off the gas , and stomped into my bedroom , where I tore off my fancy duds , heaving the tweeds onto the floor . The sleeves of the suit jacket seemed to reach menacingly for my ankles . I snarled at it . I sprinted down the basement stairs in my underwear , in search of the blue jeans I 'd dropped through the laundry chute the night before . I wrestled my way into the least filthy pair of denims and a flannel cowboy shirt , yanked an abandoned load from the washer into the dryer , thrashed the rest of my jeans into the washing machine , tossed in some soap , punched the machine onto the heavy-duty , extra-hot , no-holds-barred cycle , and whipped my hands into the air . The crowd cheers ! Once again , folks , the remarkable Em Hansen of Chugwater , Wyoming , has ridden the barrels perfectly , and at record speed ! Let 's give the little lady a hand , how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big white appliances as they whooshed and growled into life . There was something nice about being down there , in the far dark corner of Elyria 's basement , dealing with known quantities like a washer and dryer . I leaned against the washer . Its warmth and gurgling reminded me of naps I used to take when I was a little girl , curled up on top of my mother 's mammoth old machine . As it settled into an agitation cycle , the rhythms of memory gently carried me far away from new jobs , old enemies , falling bodies , and the surety that I was in way over my head . The dryer ticked and whocked happily as the zipper on something heavy went round and round . The machines grew warm to the touch . I crawled up and stretched out on top of them and in no time at all fell asleep . Having had that nap on top of the washing machines , I could n't fall asleep when I went to bed . Night city noises  | moaned and crashed all around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't in Wyoming . I lay awake , my mind caught up in Blackfeet 's unsolved puzzles and my body roused by the image of Pete Tutaraitis 's smile . My mind kept gnawing at the inconsistencies in Lost Coyote Field , at the mystery of Scott 's death , and at Pete 's odd lack of information about the field . Pete again . Pete seemed to think there was nothing wrong with the field . Perhaps I was making a mountain out of a molehill , and Lost Coyote had no hidden story . Perhaps . But as geologist assigned to the field , it was my job to prove that , was n't it ? Either way , there was nothing I could do about it until morning , so why not sleep ? What , sleep when your coworker has thrown himself out of a sixteenth-floor window ? At eleven-thirty , I tried to phone Frank , but got no answer . It felt weird to be so out of touch with him . I tried to bring his face to mind , but was discomfitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from my memory . Along about midnight , I gave up on the game of lying rigid with my eyes squeezed shut , and went into the living room to watch the Tonight Show and most of a very dreary movie that followed . It must have been two or three when I finally dozed off on the couch . The ensuing neck crick awoke me at five , at which time I staggered back to my bed and slept fitfully . As the sky grew light , I finally fell into a deep sleep and snoozed through the radio alarm as it croaked out all sorts of National Public Radio death , doom , intellectual analysis , and disaster . The phone woke me at seven-twenty , minutes before I should have been hustling out the door to the bus stop . I ca n't handle this job , I thought , as I fumbled the phone off its cradle . It was Elyria , calling from New Orleans to ask if I would please cram an antibiotic tablet down the dog 's muzzle . " Sure , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : take my mood out on the aging , flatulent doggie . " Em , is everything okay ? " " What can I say ? " " Ah . Well , I hate to ask , then , but can you take care of the dog until Sunday ? I 've run into some friends , and we were thinking of taking in some music and crawfish etouffee.  | " No problem , " I said , my heart sinking at the thought of a weekend alone in Greater Metropolitan Denver . I rang off . I ca n't handle this job . Why did I come here ? Dog and I eyed each other across the kitchen with treachery in our hearts . Cornering his ancient , malodorous frame next to the refrigerator , I pinned him between my knees , pried open his fetid mouth , crammed the monster pill past his horrible yellow fangs , and jumped up with my hands in the air , signaling to the rodeo judges that the calf was tied . The crowd roars . The smell of the steers and bucking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onto the linoleum . I ca n't handle this job . It became a mantra . After wrestling pooch-o down again , banging my knee against the stove in the process , I dumped some kibbles in his dish and some star-shaped doodads in the cat 's , stuffed a doughnut in my mouth , and hastily took stock of what morning rituals I could skip in hopes of making the 7:42 bus . I ca n't handle this job . " I can skip everything but clothes , " I muttered to the dog , as I stumbled back into my bedroom , leaving a trail of doughnut crumbs . " I do n't need a shower , do I ? You and your friends wo n't follow me down the block , will you ? " The dog sighed and crunched his kibbles . I guess nobody with any class does notice . I gassed myself with deodorant , jumped back into yesterday 's pantyhose and the least wrinkled blouse out of the dryer , kicked the dog outside , and ran for the bus . The 7:42 was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I could just see the metal leviathan fading toward town in a haze of diesel fumes . When I finally did get to work , half an hour late , I wondered what my hurry had been . I was depressed and angry and scared and slightly giddy , all at once . Two weeks on the job , I mused , I do n't know shit , my coffee 's cold , and I hate these shoes . Maybe the world will end today , and make life a little simpler . Fritz , as sniveling and snakelike as ever , brought me the morning report at nine o'clock . This time , he did n't even grunt . Maddie made big eyes at him and crooned , " I hear jack-  | alopes ride by the full moon , sweetie pea . " Her fashion statement for the day featured a very large scale black-and-yellow hound's-tooth check on linen with a Peter Pan collar . Somehow it reminded me of Elyria 's dog . She squeezed her shoulders forward voluptuously , eclipsing two columns of teeth . Fritz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so high it had pureed whatever it was he had for a brain . Ten seconds later he returned and tossed a box onto my desk . " Forgot , " he said , as he sloped back out of the room . As I watched Fritz 's narrow behind retreat , I asked Maddie , " Who 's in charge of drilling at Lost Coyote now ? " " Same as always . " That did n't tally . Scott was supposed to have been in charge , and he sure was n't calling the shots now . " To whom do you refer , Mizz McNutt ? " I said , trying to mix haughty grammar with a Texan drawl . " El Smith-o , whom else ? " she drawled in reply . " But did n't Scott ? " " Smith makes his own rules . " " Of course . " " Knew y'all 'd understand , " Maddie said , giving me her best Shirley Temple golly-gee smile , complete with the dimples . Dead end . I could n't understand Lost Coyote Field from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the well was completed and logged and new information would be available . I sure was n't going to trot into Dave Smith 's office and ask him what was going on . I clamped my teeth together and concentrated , trying to fight back the fog of irritation that was obscuring my thought . I contemplated the drill bit , grinding away thousands of feet below the surface , and willed it to chew faster . No luck . When I opened my eyes , I was still stuck in that unnatural box called an office . I opened the box Fritz had left . It was full of business cards . My business cards . Real , live Blackfeet Oil Company business cards , with my name on them and everything , and right under my name they said " Geologist . " I pulled one card out of the box and laid it on my desk . I ran my fingers over it . The ink was even raised , as if it were en-  | graved , not printed . I could n't help but grin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that I was just sitting there doing nothing , but I felt I had finally arrived . I was downright fondling the thing when Maddie took notice , so I stuffed it into one of the pockets of my suit jacket and forced my attention on the morning report . The morning report held no surprises . Drilling away at so many thousand feet below surface . Just for the hell of it , I pulled out the Lost Coyote file to see if the earlier wells had been drilled in about the same way . Maybe it would show me something I 'd been missing . The drilling information was not in the file . " Hey Maddie , " I said , " where do they file the dailies for the older wells ? " " In the vault . " " The what ? " " The vault . Ever since someone just walked in here one day and ripped off a whole bunch of files for Bar Diamond Field . Big room down on the tenth floor . You got to sign things out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fit of frustration over my ignorance when I remembered : that 's where Pete got onto the elevator the day I met him . And he 'd been carrying a file . Probably one from some field he was working on in California . " So I just go down there and tell them what I want ? What all 's down there ? " Maddie held up one lovely little hand and enumerated the treasures . " Field files , well files , maps , cross sections , well logs , field reports . You name it . They 's getting real particular these days what gets left lying around . " " Field reports ? Like on this field ? " Maddie snapped her gum . " Doubt it . " She went back to work . ( Why ? " " No reason . " " Maddie ! " She looked up . " Aw , loosen up , Emmy , it 's a new field . You do a field study on an old field , to figure out how to jazz up pro-duction . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vault .  | It was n't hard to figure out where it was . The elevator disgorged me in a rather plain expanse of hallway , not pretentiously gussied up like the lobby that gave way to the main entrance to Blackfeet Oil , or the one where Gerald Luftweiller had sallied forth from the offices of Love and Christiansen to end whatever pain confounded him . There was only one door . When I stepped through it , I found myself confronted by another hallway leading down toward what looked like a set of bull pens , but close by was a large window with a counter over the lower half of a Dutch door that had a mean-looking dead bolt in it . On the counter was a silver bell like the ones that sit on hotel managers ' desks in old movies . Beyond the counter , there was rank upon rank of metal shelving , specially sized to hold Blackfeet 's files . I rang the bell . Deep within the confines of the vault room , I heard a cough . A juicy cough , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes nowhere . At length , I heard a chair scrape . Plodding footfalls labored toward the window . The creature that emerged was a short , pallid woman in her fifties . Her pillowy flesh was loose and unevenly arranged , pushing her shoulders up under her ears , her belly bulging and her buttocks were almost nonexistent . She drinks , too , I speculated , gauging the imbalanced nutrients and lack of exercise that created that kind of effect . I forced myself to smile . And wished I had n't . The woman smiled back through thin lips that were painted too widely with a bad shade of lipstick . The smile gave way to an unsuccessful attempt to muffle another sodden cough . " May I have the well files for Lost Coyote Field ? " I asked , and as an afterthought added , " And the well logs ? " She coughed again , apparently kick-starting her voice , which wheezed out with overtones of oiled gravel : " And whom might you be ? " Points for trying with the grammar , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ geologist for Wyoming . "  | " Hansen , Hansen , " she said , thumbing through a sheaf of well-worn pages on a clipboard . " Not here . " My face fell . Was I really this much of a nonperson ? Catching my expression , she said , " Hold on , let me call Per-sonnel . " She stepped to a wall phone and dialed , said , " I 've got a girl here named Hansen , says she works for us . Uh-huh , uhhuh . Okay , thanks . " After hanging up , she shuffled off down between the stacks and started pulling files . I stared down the shelves full of files . Whole shelves had yellow tabs , others had green . The ones she brought me were orange . " What do the colors on the tabs mean ? " I asked , leaning over the counter so she could hear me . Her voice hacked out from behind a shelf ten feet away . " Orange is Wyoming . Green , California ; yellow , Texas ; so on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make way for a cough . Something niggled at the back of my mind . Something funny about the colored tabs . Then I remembered the file Pete had been carrying , the day I met him on the elevator . It was orange for Wyoming , not green for California . He had gotten on the elevator on ten . He had been coming from here . What had he been doing with a Wyoming file ? " You got to sign for these , honey , " the woman rasped , from the depths of the vault . " Notebook on the counter . " The notebook was lying open , with a ballpoint pen attached to it by a white string . The page had a column for the date , one for my name , and one for the files I was taking . Mine was the first entry under October third . There was a heavy line drawn under the last entry for October second . I quickly flipped backward , trying to calculate the date for the previous Friday , when I 'd met Pete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hath September . . . that makes last Friday the twenty-sixth . Pete 's name was not on the list for Friday , September twentysixth . I looked backward three days and forward two , but no Pete Tutaraitis . As the woman brought the first load toward the counter , she said , " Do you want me to have Fritz take these up for you ? " " No . " Maybe paranoia was setting in , but it occurred to me  | that if it got out that I was actually looking at real data , someone might come take it away from me . Instead , I had , her load the fan-folded well logs and the stacks of manila folders into a cardboard box , but I wound up making two trips , anyway . Back in my office , I stuffed the booty into an available shelf on my bookcase ( they were all available , in fact , except for the top rack , which held my company policy manual ) , and started to read the files . Sorry to say , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I really did n't know what I was looking at . Broken record , I know . What I was looking at were drawings of well completion diagrams , showing details of casing pipe and sucker rods . Then there were the dailies , listing details of the drilling and also how long the field crew had to swab the well to get the flow started when they had completed drilling and casing the well . Like milking a cow , it 's sometimes hard to get her to let down her milk . Now , I 've been on dozens of rigs as a mudlogger , and know a lot about what goes into drilling a well , but my job was always over when the drill bit hit TD , or total depth . I 'd have my trailer packed up and I 'd be towing it out of the yard as the semi tractors pulled in hauling the casing pipe . The tender mysteries of well completion and stimulation I had never witnessed . I knew that there was lots of pumping and testing that was done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rates and the most economical way to produce the field . I began to sink into a mire of despair , brought on by my own ignorance . Yawn . They test the pressure , they test the production rates .. . Latest gas tests wet . Scott 's little notebook . Of course ! I jumped up from my chair and hurried down the hall toward Scott 's office , to see if it was still there . It was n't there . The lap drawer of Scott 's desk held no red spiral-bound notebook . I leaned at an awkward angle over Scott 's desk , my heart surging with excitement , digging through the drawer beyond the lap drawer . I was on the edge of  | discovery , I knew it . I was going to figure out something important , something that would show these people that I had talent , if not knowledge . I 'd show these jumped-up baboons in business clothes , I 'd show Topsy and Rachel , I 'd show Maddie , I 'd show . . . I leaned farther @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I could n't find it either . " I about jumped out of my skin . I had been so intent on my quarry that I had n't heard Sergeant Ortega enter the room . When I whirled around to face him , he was smiling his little happy smile , his dark eyes warm and friendly . " Are you sure he kept it in that drawer ? " Ortega continued . I recovered as best I could , hoping I was not about to get arrested for tampering with evidence . " Well , I only saw it the once . Do you suppose he had it with him when he fell ? " Maybe it was time the nice man told me a few things . " No , not much but his wallet . He left his attache case here , by his desk . " Ortega indicated the space between the end of the desk and the wall . " Not much in it but a calculator and the Denver Post . " He shrugged his shoulders , like the joke was on him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " His eyes danced appreciatively . " Okay , we checked there . His house was tidy as this place . I do n't think we missed anything . " Of course , you 've been through everything , have n't you . I said , " How about his car ? " " Okay , we looked through his car , too . Nothing but a little service record book and a bunch of gas credit card receipts . " He smiled , rolling his eyes skyward . " And evidence that he had a dog . " " A dog ? What kind , a Scottie ? " Ortega laughed . " No , an Irish setter , I think . There were stiff red hairs in his car , not like human . Funny thing , though , there was no dog at his house . " " Maybe it was just a buddy hitching a ride . " Ortega laughed again , a kind of a charming little snort . As he patted his knee to magnify his appreciation of my wit , he ever so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notebook for ? "  | I glanced reflexively at the door , to make sure no one was listening . Ortega smiled his little smile and shrugged his shoulders , as if to say , Well , you ca n't fault me for trying . At which juncture I realized that I was having more fun than I 'd had since I 'd arrived in Denver . So I smiled . Ortega grinned . Then he bowed , a quick dip forward with his head and shoulders . How 's a dame supposed to resist such charm ? " You were saying , " he said . I sat down in Scott 's chair . To hell with the office mafia . The police have permission to be here , and I 'm going to have a little fun with this guy . " I was saying . I was saying that I was looking for the red notebook in the hope that I could figure out what Scott was about to tell me . So you were saying , maybe , why Scott went to talk to Menken instead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , okay . Okay , fair enough . " Ortega sat down in the chair across the desk , as if now I was Scott and Ortega was me . " They talked about his promotion . " " His what ? " Ortega turned his palms toward the ceiling . " That 's what the man said . He says Mr. Dinsmoore wanted to know what his future was with the company , and whether he was going to get a promotion . " " That does n't fit . " Ortega shrugged . I got an inspiration . " Did you go through the newspaper in his attache ? Was there anything marked up ? " Ortega rolled his eyes heavenward , emitted a faint whistle . " Smart woman . Yes , he had circled several houses to rent in the classifieds . He ever talk to you about moving ? " Ortega peered at me so intently that the seriousness of the game came back to me . " Why are you telling me this , Sergeant ? Is n't it your usual procedure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's solved ? " Ortega gazed at the ceiling , as if considering his answer . " Oh , I do n't know . Let 's just say it seems okay to tell you . Who knows ? Maybe you 'll help me figure things out . " He made a  | gesture with both hands , wiggling his fingers toward each other as if they were sparring partners , and smiled . " Then tell me why this case ' has n't been put to rest as a suicide yet . " Ortega nodded , and proceeded with utter seriousness : " Yes , okay  --  here 's how it is . A person dies . No one saw this person die , or should I say , we have no known witness to tell us why or how this person died . Okay , so that is what we call an unexplained death . Okay . So the law says the police must investigate and make a case for the mode of death : is this death homicide , suicide , or accident ? " " He did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sadness . " That 's not always easy to know . Miss Emily , you are a funny mixture . In some ways you are old , very old , a true sabio . In others , you are so , so candida , sin afectacion . . . pardon me , please ; at times ivies does not provide the word that has the feeling . I mean no offense . Inglis is my language as much as castellano , but it 's such a cold language sometimes . " Embarrassed at this sudden intimacy , I changed the subject : " So what you 're telling me is that you have n't been able to establish which category Scott 's death belongs in . Your evidence is inconclusive . " " At this time , let 's say inconclusive , yes . So tell me more about this Lost Coyote Field . " He pronounced Coyote as three syllables , with the accent on the second . It made the word sound much more vital , even romantic . " Well , I do n't know that much , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Perhaps you can tell me what Mr. Dinsmoore wrote in his red notebook that day . " " Oh , that the gas was testing wet . " I shrugged , making it seem unimportant . I began to fiddle nervously with a button on my jacket . " Anything else ? " I stuck my hands in my suit jacket pockets , trying to bring them and my mouth under control . Inside the pocket , my right hand closed over my brand-new business card , and I ran my fingertips over its raised letters as I considered my next move .  | Ortega watched me patiently . It reminded me of a look I 'd seen in my Uncle Skinny 's eyes , when he was observing a new colt he was about to bridle for the first time : a look of deeply centered patience , as if he was taking time to plan his approach . " I talked to Elyria yesterday afternoon , " he said . " Oh ? " Why is he bringing her up all of a sudden ? " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So pretty , in a suit the color of the sky . " He panned his left hand up in an arc and looked skyward , as if he could see the heavens through the stories of steel and plaster that hung over his head . God , he was good . He smiled his smile . " My heart always lifts at the sight of her . I say , Okay , Elyria , where you off to this time ? ' and she says New Orleans . Always running off somewhere . You need my baby brother Salvador to feed the dog ? ' I ask , but she says no , she 's got Em Hansen staying there , and how happy she is to have you . She 's been so alone without Bill . I say , Of course , I 've met that Em , I questioned her about this case I 'm on , ' and she says stick close to that Em Hansen , she 's the one who figured out who killed Bill . Yes , we had quite a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side expectantly , softening the gravity of his unspoken request . How dearly I would have preferred that Elyria had kept her mouth shut . Now I would be hearing from this cop until the case was solved . My choice seemed clear : I could cooperate , tell the nice policeman everything I learned and risk losing my job , or I could be faithful to the hand that fed me  --  that big , insensate hand that gave me a cushy office and a fat salary . I pulled the business card out of my pocket and looked at it . As I studied that card , I noticed that the hand that held it was beginning to heal from the rigors of drill rig life . The cuticles were no longer cracked , and the once-omnipresent cuts and calluses were fading . I thought of how my mother chided me each time she saw my hands . " Have some pride , Emily , " she 'd say , " wear gloves , or at least rub those miserable hands of yours with lotion . " How I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which seldom did more work than lighting another cigarette . My hands had been like my father 's , short-  | fingered and rough . My father 's hands were working hands , like Frank 's . Frank . His calluses used to catch in my hair . I thought of Peter Tutaraitis , with warm , smooth muscle beneath his pinpoint shirts and flannel slacks . His hands were not chapped or calloused . His hand against my back had been a new sensation , warm and fine . I sighed . " That was a fluke , Sergeant , " I said , in tones measured to sound sincere . " I 'm a geologist , not a detective . " I returned to my office and sat , waiting for the morning to melt away . If the job was just to sit , then fine , I 'd just sit . Maybe Pete would call , asking me to lunch . I managed to sit for twenty minutes , after which I decided that Pete must be out of town , and I was ready for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hallway and installed myself in a stall . I was just realizing that if I stayed in the women 's room long enough I would n't have to worry about whether Pete called me or not , when I heard the outer door groan open . Two of the engineering staff came in , in mid-conversation : " ... this weekend ? You and Gary heading up to Vail again ? " " Yeah , sigh you know the drill : champagne breakfast , fuck , fuck , fuck , and then he 's out on the links ' til dark . I ca n't wait until it snows . " " God , woman ; you 're complaining ? I have n't been laid since ... hey , speaking of laid , maybe that 's what Pete Tutaraitis 's problem is . He sure was a bastard in committee this morning . " " Naw , it 's like McNutt says : his Jockey shorts are too tight . " " Rumor has it he wears boxers . " " Yeah , well , all the same , I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bakersfield because of his wife . You know how he gets . " " Yeah . Men . "  | " I hear that woman ? " I flushed the toilet , literally drowning the conversation . He 's married ? I thought ? I hurried out of the women 's room , not meeting the engineers ' eyes , pretending that my cuff button completely consumed my attention . As I made an ass of myself trying to hurl shut the pneumatically controlled outer door behind me , I heard one of them say , " What do you suppose her problem is ? " " Du n no , " came the reply , as the door hissed slowly shut . " Maybe her Jockey shorts are too tight . " I felt like throwing a fair-sized filing cabinet through a wall . I looked at my watch . Eleven forty-five . He still might call , I thought frantically . I ca n't see him . What a goddamn idiot I am ; he was never interested in me , it was the damned oil field ! Maddie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stared at me . I got up and left . I hid in the coffee room , numbly watching someone 's brick of frozen lasagne undergo a phase change in the microwave oven . As its digital timer flicked slowly down past five minutes , the aroma of marinara sauce permeated the air . It turned my stomach . My hands trembled . Someone approached from the hallway . I lurched toward the sink and hastened to justify my presence with the ritual of making a pot of coffee . It was Menken . " Aha , Emily ! Is n't that a fine coffeemaker ? Makes the best coffee in town . I tell you , the way the grounds come prepackaged just right for one pot  --  it 's great . What American industry wo n't think up next . And these microwave meals ; truly great . Ever had one of these ? " Vague dimples sprang up in his cheeks as he grinned into my face . " No , sir . " My voice came out as a ghost . The pot shook in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it onto the countertop . " Here , Emily , let me help . " Menken smiled at his prowess as he steadied my hand . " Relax , everyone goes through this when they start a new job . " He laughed , putting his other hand on my shoulder and giving it a little squeeze . " Even I did , once , " he added , in an incredulous tone . " Thank you , sir . I 'll be all right . "  | " That 's the spirit . Now , has n't anyone given you a tour of the freezer ? Here . " He opened the upper compartment of the refrigerator , displaying a tightly stacked assortment of Stouffer 's frozen goombah . " I have these stocked so that we do n't have to go out for lunch . Saves time , my dear . Really , you should try otle . The Salisbury steak 's pretty good , but this lasagne is tremendous ' , He pulled one out and tossed it onto the counter . I observed it with about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to imagine what would be left of my sanity if I stayed in this building all day without a midday break , and distractedly weighing this idea against my dislike of the two extra elevator rides the lunch break generated . " Looks great , " I said , in a flat monotone , remembering that I could always take the stairs . Better yet , I could hide in the stairwell until Christmas or so . The timer flicked down to zero and beeped . " Ah , now here 's mine , all ready to eat . " He pulled it out . " Care to join me " " Huh ? " " Here , I 'll show you . They 're stocked at cost ; you just put your money in the sugar bowl here . But for you , my dear the first one 's free . " Laughing at his unparalleled wit , he tipped open the package on the counter , dumped the frozen chunk out onto a plate , and shoved it into the microwave . " Eight minutes . Could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along . " He picked up his cooked lasagne and headed for his office . " Irma , my dear , " he called to his secretary , as we noved down the hall , " bring Miss Hansen 's lasagne in when it 's done , wo n't you ? " I did n't open my mouth much , except to gag down the lasagne when Irma Triff brought it in , and listened with only half an ear as Menken discussed ranching practices , as if he 'd ever had his round rump any closer to a real working spread than a hot-tub-and-hayride dude ranch . After a while I onsidered asking him some questions about Lost Coyote , if he ever paused for breath . But the more he talked , the more it seemed Maddie was right : Menken was a lightweight , the last person to approach for an understanding of Lost Coyote Field . The ignorant way  | he prattled on about beef futures and sugar beet farming in southeast Wyoming , I began to wonder if someone else was making the decisions around Blackfeet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The beef and sugar beet industries have been dying slow deaths ever since Americans realized they could choose which disease of overindulgence they were going to die of . This raised an obvious question : if Menken was n't shrewd enough to run Blackfeet , then who was running it ? A few hazy notions about ways Dave Smith might be driving Blackfeet Oil from the back seat flitted around in my head . If Menken was Smith 's puppet , where were the strings attached ? Then all of a sudden , Menken himself steered the conversation around to Lost Coyote Field : " So , Emily , what have you learned about our little oil field ? " " It 's quite a field , " I replied , trying to making the observation sound like praise for his keen business acumen . " I have a few questions about it ? " " I 'm sure you do . And I expect you to dig in and find the answers for me . " Something in his tone began to make me feel uncomfortable . It seemed suggestive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How did you acquire the acreage ? " I asked . If he was n't going to give me any technical information  --  whether he had any to give or not  --  then at least I could learn a little more about the political climate around the field . " That 's a wonderful story . " Menken leaned back in his chair and admired the ceiling . " Pete Tutaraitis made the contact . Bright boy . I remember the day we laid the lease map out on the conference room table and decided where to drill . Just Pete and I. We did n't tell the engineers what we were doing . I trained in geology , you know . " He laughed , as my eyes involuntarily widened . " Yes , I 've put in my time in the ranks . Worked as a roughneck two summers during college . Good , honest work . " My evaluation of Menken inched up a notch . " Yes , Pete and I had the explorationist 's blood rushing in our veins that afternoon . I had Irma send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pete 's ethnic heritage . "  | My evaluation of the man sank again . Menken continued . " The entire lease looked good , so we each had another beer and flipped a coin . " " Flipped a coin , sir ? You mean , between two possible drilling locations ? " " No , I mean flipped one onto the map . " I was appalled . My mouth hung open . Menken grinned . " Had you going there for a moment , did n't I ? Now tell me , Emily , what have you learned about Lost Coyote ? I notice that you 're hard at work . " He eyed me closely . " Did Scott teach you what he knew about it before he left ? " Left ? " Ah , no , sir . Was there something in particular he was supposed to teach me ? " Menken smiled and seemed to relax . " No , no , no . I like to leave the details to you folks . That 's what I pay you for . Come now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time when he watched me , I watched him back , and I thought I glimpsed real intelligence peering out at me from that face . The back of my neck tightened . Something about this meeting was all wrong . I stalled , chatting about inconsequential details . Why was Menken coming to me for answers ? I was the newest member of his staff . Why not go to Pete , or Dave Smith ? Or was he trying to find out what I knew for some other , more ominous reason ? Was he concerned that I 'd been spilling the beans to the police ? By and by the phone rang , and I was dismissed . Somewhat shaken , not to mention burdened by the load of lasagne that still sat , unmoving , in my stomach , I wandered back to my office and sat down . When Maddie came back from lunch , I was glad to see her . Of Maddie 's grip on reality , I had no doubt . As she settled back to coloring the map in front of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she declared . " Do what ? " I offered . " Slant Hole . " " Huh ? " " That sounds more like you . " She started humming . Fritz walked in with some well logs for Maddie . " Hey , Fritz , " I asked , " what 's a slant hole ? " He looked arrows at Maddie . " You mean the Slant Hole . It 's a  | dive over by Broadway . Texas barbecue beans and strippers . Ecch . " He left . I picked up one of the papers on my desk and pretended to read it . Somehow , I promised myself , I 'm not sure just exactly how , but I am going to get through this with my sanity . I could n't find a position in that damned chair that was comfortable . After an hour or so , my resolution to hold still and occupy a swivel chair for a living once again began to sag , this time under the weight of simple boredom . Days had passed , enough days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been able to uncover the pattern of suicide in Scott 's death , if it were there . It followed , therefore , that someone who had been in the building that night was involved in that death . Throwing my lot in with these people took on a new dimension : would my naivete buy me a ticket for a sixteen-story lesson on corporate politics ? Even Maddie looked like One of Them . With that paranoid thought , I could keep my bottom planted in my swivel chair no longer . I headed out for the sixteenth floor , thwacking my hand on the metal handrail in the staircase to hear the sound echo against the dank cement , whistling in the dark to keep my courage up , as it were . No harm in this , I told myself . If I find anything out , I 'll just keep it to myself . It will be an exercise in curiosity , nothing more . On sixteen , I hung out in the women 's room for a while , on the off chance that someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but when that did n't happen , I ventured farther down the hall , to The Window . It was boarded up again , but this time it was also barricaded . It was festooned with yellow police tape , but more imposingly , there was a large folding table jammed across the access to it . I thought about the poor janitor , wrestling that table into place , cussing at the Fates and the Furies . Without quite wanting to I moved closer to the window , and soon found myself leaning across the tape to touch the barricade . The wood felt cold and rough against my hand . For a  | flickering moment , I felt myself both there and in the lobby , with massive death on the sidewalk beyond , and I thought , This is one way to leave . The building seemed to sway . I felt myself hurling through space , the barricade rotating upward to grab me . " Lady ! " the janitor screamed , as he grabbed me from behind , hauling me back into the depths of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ okay , lady ? " I spun around in his grasp , and found myself close enough to smell the oil on his hair , close enough to see his pulse throb in his throat . His eyes were great dark disks in a sea of yellow , alarmed and deep with concern . " I cai n't lose another , " he said . " Please do n't . I jus ' cai n't . " I tried to find my voice , but it was caught in my throat . What had happened ? Had I fainted ? The janitor was trembling . He shifted his grasp from my person to great handfuls of my tweed jacket . " I 'm sorry , I do n't mean to handle you . You jus ' settle down , okay ? " " Okay , " I managed . " I do n't know what happened . I just got dizzy . I was there that night , in the lobby ; I 've seen things falling ever since . I keep trying to fit into this job , and . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a total stranger . He steered me ponderously over to the middle of the hallway and settled me on a leather-padded bench , all the while speaking softly , whispering to me as if I were a doll . " I know , I know . My sister Lizzie had a scare like that once . She saw a man die in a crash . He called to her , but she could n't reach him . She could n't sleep sound for days and months , kept seeing him again in her dreams . " " What did she do to get over it ? " " One day she upped and went out to the street where it happened . She took flowers and said the words you say for the dead . She had to honor his passing , she said . Everybody stopped and stared at her , and the police tried to make her leave , said she was obstructing traffic , but she stayed and said her bit . She said it got better after that . " This was n't what I wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or should I say , he shepherded me to the elevator and stood guard until the doors closed and the car dropped me to the floor where I belonged . But I was n't done with the sixteenth floor yet . I returned to my desk for a while and tried to talk myself out of going back up there , but in the end reason lost out over compulsion , and I headed back upstairs . Via the elevator this time . I looked both ways before getting off the car , not wanting to rob the janitor of what peace he had left . Then I hurried across the hallway into the main office of Love and Christiansen . I was confronted with a wide mahogany reception desk , but no receptionist . So I kept going , down a short hall and around a corner , until I was confronted with a secretary . That 's putting it mildly . That 's like calling the devil a little imp ; this woman was to " secretary " what Mussolini was to " despot . " " What do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes at me . Well , I could have said something mild , like " Nothing , " or diverted her and played on her sympathies with an innocent diversion , such as " I 'm lost , " but no , I always have to justify my existence . I said , " I 'm looking for Simon . " Hey , it 's just the first name that popped into my head . The only time I 've ever even known anyone who knew anyone by that name was the previous Monday , when Scott had answered the phone and scribbled down the caller 's name . I figured Attila the Secretary would give me a scorching There 's no one here by that name and send me packing . What she said was , " He 's out . " So then I had to say , " When will he be back ? " And she said , " Next week , maybe . " And I said , " Where is he ? " The answer was a growly " Whom shall I say was looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So I got real wise and said , " Libby Hopkins . " And left quickly , before she could refuel her flamethrower . I do n't know why I told her Libby Hopkins , either ; all the way back down to my office , I wished ardently I were someone else , like maybe some-  | one who has the cool and refinement not to mix it up with asshole secretaries . Blabbing a real person 's name had undoubtedly been a mistake . The possibility this Simon and Libby Hopkins knew each other was real , considering that Rachel and Topsy had known Scott , and Scott had known Gerald Luftweiller , who had worked for Love and Christiansen , and Scott had also known at least one dude named Simon . The threads of connection around Denver were beginning to pull into a big ugly knot . Trying not to give a damn about the world when the world is n't done with you has serious side effects . By the end of the afternoon , I had settled down somewhat , having perfected the fine art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scribbling a letter to Frank on a tablet next to it . I had thrown out three tries at a newsy letter , and stalled out in the middle of the fourth . There was certainly a lot to tell him , but I somehow could n't find the right words . Frank had been friend , lover , and father confessor to me all summer , but now as I tried to decide what to say in the letter , he seemed too far away to hear me , and everything I wrote seemed obnoxiously flippant or embarrassingly self-obsessed . At four-thirty , I gave up on the try at correspondence and put the letter in a drawer . I told myself that as soon as I got home I 'd take a nice hot shower with emphasis on the soap , and then give him a call . At five o'clock sharp , Maddie rose from her chair , arched her back in a combined stretch and Richard Nixon victory pose , let out a howling yawn , and scratched her belly . I wondered whether her lime-green sheath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear it for poet 's day , " she drawled , dragging her pocketbook out of a desk drawer . " What 's poet 's day ? " I asked . " Stands for Piss on Everything , Tomorrow 's Saturday , ' " she replied , as she sauntered out the door . I reached for my own gear , figuring I could share an elevator with her , then remembered how late I 'd been that morning . Best to occupy my chair for a full eight hours , whether there 's anything  | to do or not . I leaned back in my swivel chair , my arms dangling like they were made of lead . Before long , my eyes closed . I 'm not sure just how I became aware that Pete had come into the room . Perhaps my nose had become sensitized to the scent of expensive leather and subtle aftershave , or maybe my entire skin is an infrared heat sensor tuned to warm muscle under grey flannel . Anyway , I 'm sure I did n't hear those loafers cross the carpet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened my eyes , he was standing barely five feet away , his weight slung provocatively onto one leg , smiling a smile that ought to be outlawed . " You look comfortable , " he purred . I crashed my chair back into an upright position , bouncing it a little on the casters . " Oh , " I said . " It 's you . " His smile faded . " What 's wrong ? " he asked . " What do you mean ? " I replied , trying the patented World 's Worst Line for Evading Scrutiny . Pete took a seat on the corner of my desk , swinging one of his fantastic , muscular legs very close to mine . " All the light 's gone out of your eyes , " he said , in a voice hushed with concern . He looked down at my near hand and shyly touched my smallest finger with his . " You look very much like you 're angry with me . " All of my attention became intensely focused on the tiny area of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tired , " I croaked , Pete took my hand up in both of his . " I do n't think that 's all it is . " I looked away , withdrawing my hand . " That 's not appropri-ate , " I said , quite proud of myself for managing to say anything , even if it did sound priggishly judgmental . " I do n't understand , " Pete said . " You 're married . " I cringed at how petulant I sounded . Pete 's face lit with a cheerful smile . " Oh , is that all it is , " he said , raising his left hand and examining his wedding ring . " I wonder why I do n't take this thing off . " He observed it a moment longer , a trace of pain now troubling the impossibly handsome sweep of his dark brows . His next words were barely audible : " It does n't mean much anymore . "  | " It does n't ? " Why had n't I noticed the ring before ? Where had I been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lap . " You 're right . You 're a decent woman , a fine woman ; you deserve a man who 's free to treat you as you deserve . I can only ' hope you 'll be around at such a time as I can offer you that . I 'm sorry . It 's just , well , that it 's been so long already since Elizabeth left , that I 've begun to think of myself as already , well , free to go on with my life . " I felt like a bully . I overhear a stray comment in the women 's room , and ? " I 'm sorry , " I whispered . " I jumped to conclusions . " He squeezed his eyes shut , forcing back emotion , and subconsciously fiddled with his ring . " No , I 'm the one who 's sorry . My behavior must look awful to you . You must think I 'm a ? well , there are names for it . " " No , " I said , and impulsively touched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he might think me too forward . " Hey , Emily , " he said , singing my name the way he did . He smiled his million-dollar smile again , its warmth pouring over me like warm chocolate . " Forgive a guy for getting his cart a little bit in front of his horse , okay ? " I grinned . " Sure . " Hey , can he help it if he oozes charm , good looks , and sexuality ? Jesus , Em , he was born that way ; give him a break . He smiled shyly . " What I came in here for was to see if you could join me for a drink after work . But maybe I should come back and ask you again  --  ah , later . " He glanced pointedly at his wedding ring . I sneaked a look at his thighs , where they rested against the edge of the desk . Little muscles tightened in my abdomen . I quickly raised my eyes higher in an attempt to stay out of trouble , but that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warmth underneath his suit coat was still too fresh . " I could use a drink , " I said , tentatively , but quickly added , " You know , like between friends ? " " Friends it is . " He gestured toward the door . Well , I walked out of that office with my hips rolling like they 'd just been lubed . The elevator ride was a pleasure . The lobby never looked so grand and spacious , and the air of Denver never tasted so sweet . Pete strode along beside me , chatting  | about the coming autumn , his long , catlike strides transforming the mundane sidewalk into a plaza for the gods . We headed down Seventeenth to Broadway and called in at Duffy 's Bar . It was strange : I 've always tried to be moderate in drink , but after one beer , I quit worrying so much about who saw us . After two , I was amazed at what a wit I was . After three , I noticed we were eating Duffy 's boiled dinner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ count . Before I knew it , we were walking around the Civic Center park , walking off Irish beer so Pete could drive me home . Pete strolled along the narrow stonework around a dry fountain , putting one foot in front of the other like a tightrope walker , laughing at something I 'd said . " You like the shape of the Heritage Center ? " He gestured across the park at the wedge of architecture . " You do n't think it 's a takeoff ramp for visiting extraterrestrials ? Okay , then how about that building they put the art museum in ? " " Looks like a computer punch card , does n't it ? " I answered . " But hey , who 's this cowgirl to judge it ? " Pete laughed again . I liked the way his laughter sounded , slightly wild in the night air . " You 're no cowgirl , " he said . " Born and bred in Chugwater , Wyoming . Raced the barrels with my Four-H team . Just moved here from the far-flung wilds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Then where 'd you learn to dress like something out of the business section of Women 's Wear Daily ? " I was just drunk enough on Pete and Guinness Stout that I said , " That 's my grannie 's doing . She lives in Boston . " " Blood breeds true . That 's why I 'm so attracted to you . Like the moth to the flame . " He stopped walking and turned toward me , the streetlights playing around the planes of his face like a lover 's hands . " You 're just saying that . " " No , it 's true . I 've never been able to resist an eastern blue blood , but you , Emily , you 're fantastic . There 's something about you those women never even see in their dreams . " I felt giddy . I struggled to bring the subject onto safe ground . " I 'll bet your wife is special in her own way . " Pete laughed mirthlessly . " Sure . She 's special . She ca n't even  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the bottom of her closet . She ca n't leave the house unless every dish is clean and in its place on the shelf . She ca n't ? " " Maybe I should n't be hearing this . " Pete nodded and fell silent . There I was saying the right thing , but the Guinness Stout and my heart ran away with me , and I dreamt of ways I could make it up to him . We walked back down Seventeenth Street and crossed into the parking garage beneath our building , where we descended two flights into its grey concrete depths , our footfalls echoing loudly in the abandoned night . High as I was , stray thoughts of the young rookie sealing off the exits from this same garage the night Scott died leaked into my happy pink haze . I was relieved when Pete unlocked the door of his Saab , letting me into the security of its fine upholstery and lavish appointments . A little red light blinked on the dashboard . Burglar alarm , my brain informed my semicomatose self . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Pete strolled around the car at his leisure , even took time to fold the back seat up into place and fiddle with the latch that held it before he laid his coat across the seat and got in . " Is n't this sucker going to start to hoot ? " I asked , pointing at the blinker . " Hoot ? You 're an original , Emily . No , it 's just a little blinking light , doing just what it 's supposed to do  --  look like a burglar alarm . " He flashed me his smile and fired the ignition . The car moved smoothly up the ramps and out onto the street , accelerating down the lighted avenue like a bullet , the streetlights making lovely patterns on the wide , curved sweep of the wind-shield . Lightning flashed in the western sky , the clear night giving way to black storm clouds . One massive thunderhead rose like a fist along the foothills , occluding the moonlight . The Saab rolled across the viaduct over the Platte River to the northwest side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past us like silk . All too soon , the car slowed to a stop in front of Elyria 's house . Pete left the engine idling.  | " Thanks , Pete , " I said . " No , thank you , Emily . You 're wonderful company . " " Um , want to come in for some coffee ? " Pete smiled a loaded smile . " No . " He kissed me deftly on my nose . " I 'm behaving myself , remember ? " I climbed out , suddenly awkward as I negotiated the curb . This was what I wanted , was n't it , that I could just enjoy his company as  --  well , a friend ? But now it seemed so silly . Even wasteful . I gave him one more look of invitation , as I reluctantly closed the door and stood back , but Pete just flashed the headlights and drove off into the night . Alcohol and I have never the best of friends . Now it had gotten its way with me once again , seducing me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embarrassment and an early hangover . A querulous little voice in my head offered the opinion that a man like Pete could never really take an interest in me anyway , that he 'd only been staving off the loneliness of impending divorce . I got a beer out of the refrigerator in the vain hope that another hair of the dog would finish me off so I could pass out , if not sleep , and sat in the dark for a good half hour , unbearably lonesome and damned sorry for myself . Through an open window I could hear the risings and fallings of a conversation being held on a porch near the corner . Ortega 's family lived there , and everyone from Mama and Papa down to the smallest of the kids and their dog and half their close friends could be heard chatting and yapping and playing and shrieking until at least eleven P.M. any night of the week . A car passed by on the street . The cool breeze from the thunderstorm sighed in through the casement windows above the couch , carrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city air and the dying  | perfume of Indian summer . This would be one of the last thunderstorms of the year . Soon , the mountain air that drained into Denver during the night would carry the first crisp breath of Colorado 's short autumn . The aspen would already be showing gold on the higher slopes , and any morning now I would stumble out toward the bus stop and see a powdering of snow along the continental divide . But for now , my neighbors still lived their evenings on the porch . Theirs was a pleasant hubbub , a background patter occasionally punctuated with a child 's cry of rage or pain , followed by a hot string of Spanish if adult , or a falling chorus of wails if a child . Another car approached . I peeked over the back of the couch and looked out , longing for the nerve to join the gathering . A police cruiser was just pulling up . Two men climbed out , one in uniform , the other not . I crouched low at the recognition of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mama and took seats on the porch , joining Papa in a cool cerveza . I fought between the instinct to avoid this man and the desire to stroll down the sidewalk toward his gentle smile . Who knows , maybe the Ortegas would invite me onto the porch for a beer . Surely the sergeant would n't talk shop in his off-hours , with his family around . No . I was on a nodding-hello basis with the family already , but I was just a gringa , some cracker who happened to live nearby . I imagined that " Hello " and " Nice day " was precisely as intimate as we could ever be . The antique clock on the mantelpiece ticked disconsolately . Another car passed by . My beer went flat . Elyria 's dog yawned deeply in his spot by the fireplace , rose , and pattered out of the room in search of greater privacy . I reached for my very ordinary gringo beer again , knowing it would taste sour . I took a swig and held it in my mouth , wincing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bottle . I considered turning on the TV , and immediately hated myself more . What am I , a city bum already ? No walks in the moonlight when I 'm feeling shitty ?  | The telephone in Bill 's disused study began to loom in my consciousness , luring me . I 'm here and you know it , Em . You can be alone with me , get away from that hole in your chest . Just come to me and press my little buttons , and I 'll get Frank on the line for you . He 'll say , " There there , " and , " Aw now Em honey , " and all those other things you like to hear . So what if you left him back there in Wyoming ? So what if he was kind of hurt to see you go ? He 'll understand , remember ? He said so . He even said that if you stayed right now things would probably never work out between you , that you 'd be off before spring came . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But it was a Friday night . Frank would probably be out at the bar with his chums , if he was n't at work . No point in calling . And how could I run to him for comfort when I felt such loneliness for another man ? I awoke Saturday morning with a fine case of cotton mouth , and spent what was left of the morning feeling exquisitely sorry for myself . I worked some of my self-pity out on another canine rodeo in the kitchen , then pumped two glasses of o j. and a handful of B vitamins into my shattered stomach , and sulked in a hot bath for over an hour . By one o'clock , I was enough recovered that I could focus my eyes on the rental ads in the Rocky Mountain News . If I was going to be the model oil company employee , I had to have a model oil company employee place to live . Which got me thinking about Scott Dinsmoore . He had spent his last morning on earth reading this same section of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be interpreted as either the final peace of a man who 's chosen to die , or of a man who had found a solution in living . Somehow , I could n't feature a man on the brink of suicide perusing the house-to-rent section of the Rocky Mountain News . Maybe that was how Ortega had it figured , too : one does n't simultaneously plan for life and death . What had been  | his living situation ? I ran my eye down the page . Was it an **29;28;TOOLONG cluster home in southeast Denver , or was it urban homestead Victorian chic on Capitol Hill ? I closed the paper in disgust , my hangover doubling back on me with a vengeance . Every single listing looked to me like an invitation to live in hell . The truth was , I wanted to live in a city like I wanted a hole drilled in my head with a rusty bit . To be fair , part of the problem was that I had never rented an apartment before ; since leaving home I had lived in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in between times , I had stayed in the converted tack room of my Uncle Skinny 's barn north of Casper . Oh , and then of course I 'd just spent the summer with Frank , in his little house outside Meeteetse . Frank . Shit , what was I going to do about Frank ? He was a quiet , very perceptive man ; if I phoned him , would he detect my straying affections ? Maybe a little later on I 'd go get the letter I 'd been writing to him , maybe even mail it . The day wore on . It was another spectacular Colorado day , suitable for brisk walks in the foothills or at least hours lolling on the lawn , but all I could think of was my frustration over Pete Tutaraitis . I sat slumped at the kitchen table , wishing Elyria was home to talk some sense into me . At two-thirty , the phone rang . When I answered it , Rachel Conant 's contralto commanded the line , with her usual barebones conversation . " Em , can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she 'd like to see you . " " Sure , why not , " I said , matching her blase tone . At times like this , Rachel Conant sounded like a stand-up comic doing an impression of someone like Rachel Conant . " Eleven-thirty . We 're on Washington Park , nine-eighty South Franklin , at Tennessee . " " Can I bring anything ? " My manners crunched into gear as I scribbled the address on a supermarket receipt . " Just yourself . " The receiver clicked before I could give her my reflexively polite sign-off . After indulging myself in a bit of virtuoso tooth-gnashing , I decided that exercise would improve my mood , such as a walk down to Sloan 's Lake . I decided to take the pooch.  | I regarded him with an attempt at friendliness . " So by the way , flea bag , what 's your name ? " I murmured , staring into his rheumy eyes . Flea Bag moaned . He came along willingly enough , if a little slowly , and we managed an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped frequently to sniff bits of real estate with extreme suspicion . Fat men mowed their lawns . Several Flight-for-Life helicopters churned overhead on their way to and from St. Anthony 's Hospital , and on one street , some kids were playing kickball . Normalcy incarnate . I 'd say the whole tour was a howling success , if it were n't for the fact that at each new block I caught myself wondering if this one might be where Pete lived . As we returned to Elyria 's house , we passed the Ortega family , arrayed on the front porch of their bucolic brick Victorian . I nodded to them . Mrs. Ortega smiled broadly . Mr. Ortega bobbed his stout round head slightly and saluted me with a beer . Their dog barked at mine . The kids shrieked . Back in the house , I found the message light blinking on Elyria 's answering machine . Through trial and error , I figured out the correct button to push to get the message to play back . Pete 's voice warmed the speaker : " Hi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was just wondering if you were free to join a friend for a cup of coffee , but I 'll see you on Monday . Ciao . " A little electronic voice squawked the time the message had come in . I 'd missed him by five minutes . I bent right over onto the rug and started beating it with my fists . Then I pulled myself together enough to turn angst into action and pull out the phone book . No Tutaraitis , Peter listed . I tried Information . They had a Tutaraitis in Wheat Ridge , wrong first name , and a Peter in Boulder . I dialed it and heard a very pleasant announcement from another answering machine , but the male voice that answered certainly was n't the Peter I knew . Hell , I figured , he has to have a phone . I dimly remembered a confidential employee home phone list among the stack of papers good old Personnel had given me the day I signed on . Was  | I crazy enough to go in to work on a Saturday just to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , maybe . Nah , said another part of me . You have more cool than that . You have a perfectly good boyfriend in Wyoming , and he is n't even married to someone else . I mean , get serious : if you want a husband , why not get one of your own ? I sat there chuckling dryly at my own wit , until I remembered the letter to Frank that was moldering in my desk drawer . Well , see ? I got ta go mail that letter anyway . Like hell . No , really , it 's no imposition ; I was n't doing anything , anyway . Sucker . Fine . But I 'm going to the office . After brief consideration of the bus lines , I grabbed a set of keys from the kitchen and headed for the garage . Hey , Elyria 's note had said I should feel free to use Bill 's truck if I needed to go for groceries or something . Why suffer the bus on a Saturday ? You 're just afraid Mr. Wonderful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Shut up . I could n't get the truck started . See ? The Fates do n't want you finding this guy . Get lost . There was a perfectly good bicycle in the garage , and the tires were even pretty well inflated . I wheeled it toward the street . The Ortegas waved . I waved back and aimed the bicycle downtown , a foolish grin spreading across my face . Now I know why people do n't ride their bikes to work in Denver . From Thirtieth I turned onto Speer Boulevard , where I had a near miss with a low-rider . Two different trucks swerved , horns blaring , as I crossed the long viaduct over the Platte River , Interstate 25 , and the Union Pacific freight yards , and as I came down the other side , I almost lost the front wheel in a chuckhole . I cut onto Market Street as soon as I could , bouncing around over some patched-up pavement and old trolley tracks , then cut down the Sixteenth Street Mall , dodging pedestrians left and right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foot traffic let up a little , but I had to run a slalom with the mall buses and their eardrum-shattering brakes all the way to Welton . As I bumped up over the curb at Seventeenth and wheeled the bike into the lobby of the Cattlemen 's Exchange Building , the poisons from the previous night 's alcoholic largess finally burst through my skin . I did n't have a lock for the bike , so I muscled it onto the elevator , punched twelve , and waited . The car trembled heavenward . When the door opened at the twelfth floor , I found myself face-to-face with Peter Tutaraitis . " Good afternoon , lady friend , " he said , his smile widening into a grin . I mentally took stock of my windblown , exhaust-shrouded hair , my worn blue jeans , and my faded flannel shirt soaked with sweat , and about sank to my knees in embarrassment . " Hi , Pete , " I managed , in an asthmatic rasp . " You 're a sight for sore eyes , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and kissing the top of my head . " Better and better . I love a woman who can look classy all week , and then let her hair down on the weekends . " The elevator door tried to close against his shoulder and bounced back into its scabbards . I grabbed it to keep it from closing again , dropping the bicycle on Pete 's feet . He laughed and took the bicycle from me , drawing it out into the hallway . " So ; ca n't get enough of dear old Blackfeet ? " he asked . " No , I just came down to pick up a letter I left here yester-day . " " Do you have a key ? " " A key ? " " Yes , the door 's locked . No one 's here . " " Oh , " I said . " Right . " Pete produced his own key , and let me in through the back door , saying , " I 'm glad I ran into you . I was just thinking about you . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but you were out . " " Oh , did you ? " " Are you in a hurry to get somewhere ? "  | " No , a cup of coffee would be great . I mean , how about a cup of coffee ? " " Like you were reading my mind . " Pete followed me into my office . I pretended I could n't find the letter , but Pete pulled out the one desk drawer I avoided , and there lay the letter to Frank , right on top . " Is this it ? " he said . " The one that starts out , Dear Frank ' ? " " Right . " Taking the letter from him as casually as I could , I crammed it into my back pocket and put a cheery smile on my face . Pete returned my smile ; a long , leisurely look , rich in ap-praisal . I was suddenly uneasy . In the lapse between our words , the dead stillness of the building had crowded in . It was so quiet that I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual rush and hum of the building was missing , the pulse and respiration of all systems shut down for the weekend . During the week , when the building had been full of bustling activity , it had been easier to forget that this was a place where death had occurred . Two deaths , of men who knew each other . Now that the offices were empty , death moved through them like a vapor . I quit smiling . Pete saw that look in my eyes and stepped toward me . " What is it ? " he whispered . He grasped my shoulders . I flinched , thinking , Who is this guy really ? He let go of me , but held his hands a few inches away , tipped his head closer . " Hey , what is it ? " he repeated . I squeezed my eyes shut . Get a grip , Em . When I opened my eyes again , Pete had straightened up and was stepping back , his mouth set in a line of pain . I was immediately anxious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repelling the one person  | in this office who was trying to be friendly . This sensitive , powerfully attractive . . . " I 'm sorry , " I said . He stopped , put his hands in his pockets . " Someone had a hard week ? " I sighed . " A hard couple of weeks . " " Coffee , " he said . We locked the office and rode the elevator down to the street , where the long , golden light of late afternoon reached its fingers between the buildings . Pete wheeled the bike along , steering it by the seat with subtle , sure movements of his wrist . " I have an idea . Why not make this something more than coffee ? Do you have anywhere you need to be ? We could drive out to the foothills and catch the sunset . " " Sure . " " My car 's over here ; we can just throw your bicycle in back . " He turned the corner at Welton Street and headed for the Saab , which was parked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he paused by the back end , fished the keys out of his pocket , and started to unlock the trunk . " Do n't you need to fold the seats down from the inside ? " I asked , peering in a side window of the sedan . " No , this car 's five years old . The catch is n't what it once was . The dog chewed it up . Watch . " He hoisted the bike up and fed it straight into the trunk , knocking the seat forward with the front tire . The bicycle fit in easily between the taillights and the back of the front seat . " I 've slept in this thing before , car-camping , " he added . I tried to imagine all of Peter Tutaraitis laid out in that space . He 'd have to sleep diagonally . Then I remembered that his wife would have been in there with him , and I suffered a pang of jealousy , and found myself wondering how she could dream of leaving such a man . The next hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the rise of suburbs that lies between Denver and the foothills to the Alameda hogback , a great fin of upended rock and dry chaparral that every geology student in the surrounding five states has seen . It has footprints left by dinosaurs and ripple marks formed by waters that flowed past tens of millions  | of years ago . We parked the car and climbed a trail that ran along the crest of the hogback through the mountain mahogany , gaining a great view of the sun setting over the massive monoliths of Red Rocks Park , then wandered into the tiny town of Morrison for buffalo steaks . The cerveza slid down smoothly . After dinner we looked out over the lights of Denver for a while before climbing back into the Saab to return home . As the car sped northward between the hogback and the foothills and the time approached to say good-night , my anxiety that I 'd offended him in any way at the office that afternoon came back . " Bad weeks drag , and good times end too soon , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another little tour , shall we ? " He veered suddenly onto an entrance ramp for Interstate 70 , which led westward up Mount Vernon Canyon and into the foothills , the route Elyria and I had taken to Georgetown . Had that only been a week ago ? " Where exactly are we going ? " I asked , as he turned right onto a winding road that led northward , away from the high-way . " Have you ever seen the M ? " he asked , mischief leaking out of every pore . " The M ? " " Yes , the M for Em . It 's a big letter M on the side of Mount Zion above Golden , above the School of Mines campus . You can see it for miles . And it 's lit up at night . " " I 've only seen it by daytime , and from a distance . It 's just painted on the rocks , is n't it ? " " Whitewashed . Each rock is painted separately . They have each freshman at Mines carry one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 're in for the thrill of a lifetime , " he said , gearing down to take the turns even faster . " I 've always wanted to do this . " " Do what ? " Pete just laughed . The twisting road crested the top of a wooded mesa and began to descend steeply . I caught glimpses of the lights of Denver . " This is where all the townies come to neck . " He gestured to a row of cars parked in a narrow turnout ,  | noses to the city lights . " Down there , you can see the Coors Brewery between North and South Table Mountain . " He pointed to a bee 's nest of lights and buildings between two pools of darkness . Several long switchbacks down from the summit of Mount Zion , Pete parked the car on a stretch of shoulder barely wide enough to pull off the road . " Follow me , " he ordered , heading for the high side of the road , where he disappeared into the darkness . I looked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enormous white letter on the hillside , grotesquely foreshortened . As I scrambled up the path , I could see the whitewashed rocks , and hanging just above the rocks , arrayed on long strands of wire , were myriad little light bulbs , casting the chauvinistic initial of the School of Mines out into the night , that all its acolytes might feel their hearts pound proudly in their chests . There was a ragged chain-link fence around the M. When I got to it , I saw that Pete had scaled it and was moving quickly down the line of lights , unscrewing them . " What are you doing ? " I asked . " I 'm sending School of Mines a message , " he laughed . " The lights have never been out all night . " " Never ? " Pete 's grin flashed . " There 's a bunch of Neanderthals called the Blue Key Club who keep watch over the thing . They 'll be up this hill in a flash . Come on , help me ! " I thought , What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and scaled the fence . Reaching the line of bulbs , I touched one gingerly . They were only twenty-five watts , barely warm to the touch . With a quarter turn , it was out . Then I noticed a tremendous litter of broken glass , testimony to less gentle techniques of dousing the M that had been used in the past . I hurried down the far line of bulbs , scrabbling over the whitewashed stones , and met Pete in the middle . Grinning wildly with the thrill of the game , he threw an arm around me , tugged me close , and kissed me on the neck , in that tender place by the corner of the jaw . He pulled just as quickly away , but the scent of his body clung to me like a narcotic .  | As I followed him back down the slope through the mountain mahogany to his car , I felt I was capable of anything , a woman in charge of her fate . The Blue Key Club , two Jeeps full of beefy engineering students , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we were only two switchbacks down the mountain . We hardly spoke as we drove back , taking the slow way , circling around behind the brewery and following Thirty-second Avenue all the way back through the suburbs . " Surely you need a cup of coffee , to warm you up , " I said , as Pete turned down the block toward Elyria 's . " Thanks , but it 's late , and I would n't want to disturb your roommate . " I grinned . " She 's out of town . " Pete agreed to come in for one quick cup of coffee , which he drank sitting in a wooden chair in the kitchen . The moment he finished his cup , he rose to go . At the door , he gave me a friendly smile and hugged me chastely . I hugged him back , pulling him closer . " Hey , " he said , putting his hands on my shoulders , pushing me away to arm 's length . " What 's this ? " " I 'm sorry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because I was n't . What I was feeling was , well , aggressive . I ca n't remember what I was thinking . " We agreed , " he said , sliding his hands from my shoulders to my back in a slow massage . " I 'm sorry , " I said again , smiling now . " Do n't do this to me , " he said , his voice soft and thick . Pete drew me against his body , one hand searching through my hair for my face . After a moment , he kissed my throat , my ear , and then my lips , grasping my arms rhythmically like a giant cat purring over a treat . Time passed , punctuated only by the moisture of his mouth and the hypnotic caress of his hands . Then he turned off the lights , and like someone speaking from a dream , he said , " Where 's your bedroom ? "  | " Over there . " I pointed . Night air touched my breasts . I realized my shirt was already open . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , streetlights played across his face . He was grinning . I awoke in the darkness . Someone was moving around in the room . Where was I ? What was happening ? Then I woke up far enough to remember that Pete was with me . I reached to the place next to me where I had felt him through the night and found nothing . " Pete ? " " Over here . " His voice came from the middle of the room . " What are you doing ? " " Getting dressed . " " Why ? " I peered at the clock . " It 's only five o'clock . The sun is n't even up yet . " " I have to get home . " " Why ? There 's nobody there . " I laughed , but it came out kind of squeaky , a telltale nervousness magnified by the dark-ness . " Ah , no ... but there 's a neighbor coming over at eight , for breakfast . We 're going to head up into the mountains for a drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look good if I was n't there . " " That 's not for three hours . " " I know , but I was awake anyway . " " Well , what ? Were you going to leave without waking me ? " He sat down on the edge of the bed and kissed me , a quick smooch . " No , no ; I was just about to wake you . " He stood up again to tuck in his shirt . " Pete ? " " Yes ? " " Is something wrong ? " " No , nothing 's wrong . Well , listen , Em , things are a bit of a  | mess between me and Elizabeth . We have n't gotten along for years , to be honest , and there are a lot of hurt feelings . On both sides . I do n't want it to get any worse . " His voice held a mixture of irritation and sadness . I felt a weird urge to apologize , even though I did n't think I 'd done anything wrong . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong ? " " What do you mean ? " " With your wife . " Pete did n't say anything , but I could hear his breath ease out in a long , frustrated sigh . I said , " I 'm sorry , I guess it 's none of my business . " " It 's all right . I guess I do n't really know what went wrong . It 's just , well , she ca n't seem to be happy here in Denver . It 's sad , because back when we first knew each other back east , things were different . Well , maybe not perfect , but I thought her unhappiness with me was because we were n't married yet . I was pretty naive . " " What do you mean ? " " Oh , I thought she 'd come to love me more . " His voice trailed off . " She does n't love you ? " His voice got very small . " I mean physically . " " What ? " " Listen , things may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owe it to her to maintain appearances until we get things settled . It 'll save trouble later on . Okay ? " I stared past him at the ceiling . It was n't okay , but I did n't know what I could say or do to make it any different . All I knew was that I did n't want him to leave . " Go back to sleep , " he said , bending to kiss my eyes closed . I heard his footsteps in the hallway , and the front door closing , and his car starting away from the curb . I lay awake , watching through the gap in the curtains as the day arrived . Coffee is the great cure . As the bitter brew woke me up , I felt more sure of myself , and by the time I 'd emptied the second  | cup on the back deck , the sun was growing warm on my face and I was enjoying its red flush through my closed eyelids . On this suitably hot screen , I replayed scenes from the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turning out the lights ; Em the wit ; Em the bold lover ; Pete the enigmatic , sensual hunk . I took a long bath with bubbles , admiring the shape of my shell-pink feet at the far end of the tub , wondering how I had lived with them all these years without noticing how lovely they were . The thought of Pete 's touch unleashed wonderful hollow sensations in my solar plexus . It was like a certain physical gravity had entered me , pulling me closer to the earthly pleasures of life . A stray thought of Frank flitted across my mind , but I pushed it aside . Frank was brooding and rough-edged , like weathered wood . Pete was dazzling and smooth . It 's amazing what good sex can do for one 's sense of wellbeing . The day had a special glow , every drop of dew in the garden a precious gem . Even Elyria 's dog seemed an old friend , hardly cowering as I approached him after the bath . He only spit his pill out once . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the door . Okay , the first thought through my head was It 's Pete , but I managed to control myself on the way to the door , even taking time to walk around the coffee table instead of jumping over it . It was Sergeant Ortega . " Hi , neighbor , I just dropped my mother off after church and thought I 'd stop in , see if you have some coffee for the nice policeman . " I stiffened . Was this going to be more pressure for me to discuss Blackfeet 's business ? Ortega 's face fell . " I 'm sorry , is this a bad time ? You seemed uncomfortable being questioned at work , so I thought it might be better here . " He waited , his head cocked to one side , eyeing me with polite curiosity , and , as time stretched without a reply , confusion . Curiosity got the better of me . Besides , he was a neighbor . I stepped back and pointed the way to the kitchen . " Cream or sugar ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Aqui esta . " I set the sugar bowl on the table , hoping my accent was n't as atrocious as I feared . " a Se habla castellano ? " I dredged my memory for a little more of my high school Spanish , intimidated by his elegant , rich pronunciation . " Ah , si , pero solamente un poquito . " " Que linda , senorita ; es muy bueno . " " No , es muy malo . " " Bueno . " He made a grand gesture , appropriate for the bull ring . " Usted es loco , senor policia . " He laughed , patting his round knee . " That 's very good . " " No es verdad . " Ortega 's whole body bounced with his quiet laughter . " Is English your second language ? You speak it with a trace of an accent . " " No , I learned both languages together , when I was un nitro . The accent is that of the Mexicans of el valle , where we lived back then . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No . The San Luis Valley , down by Alamosa . " " But you call yourself a Mexican , and not a Chicano or Latino ? " " Si . We were Mexicans before Colorado was part of the United States ; we are Mexicans now , " he explained . He squared his shoulders with exaggerated dignity . " I am the proud Mexi-can . " He winked , and smiled . " Then what 's a Latino ? " " A more general term , like Hispanic . " " And Chicano ? " " A more political person . " " Oh , I see . " I was lying ; his logic sounded pretty political to me . So I said , " A matter of , urn , the coravin . " His smile spread into a grin . " Si , del corazon , " he said , patting his heart . Then tapped his head . " Tii eyes muy inteligente . " His switch from the formal to the familiar you was n't lost on me . " You 're a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information very badly . "  | He shrugged . " Well , okay . Yes , you 're right ; information , always information . Just a few more questions , so we can wrap things up . " He opened his palms apologetically . " So sorry to interrupt your Sunday . " He smiled merrily and added three spoonfuls of sugar to his coffee . " I would have come last evening , but you had company . " I felt the blood rush to my face . " Uh , yeah , a friend kind of dropped over . " Ortega 's eyes danced . Now I was irritated . It was n't any of his damned business if a guy came to see me and did n't leave until late . Or was it ? Had he seen who it was ? Shit ! As if he 'd read my mind , Ortega dropped his gaze . He tasted his coffee and added more sugar . I 'm not sure whether I was more worried that Pete 's indiscretion might be uncovered or that Ortega might draw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scott 's death meeting on the sly . Without even trying to hide my irritation , I muttered , " So what did you want to ask me ? " Ortega bowed his head , making a detailed study of the inside of his coffee cup . I could almost see the little gears in his head working . He was here because he needed information from inside , and he was out . He was out not just because he was the cop threatening to invade the sanctity of oil company secrets , but because in that white Anglo-Saxon kingdom he lacked social connections , or perhaps just the right color skin . It was irony of the deepest kind that he would come to Em Hansen , rookie girl geologist from Chugwater , Wyoming , for entree anywhere . No one knew better than I how tough it was to get information out of that place . " What did you want to ask me ? " I repeated , in a kinder tone . Ortega 's face brightened . " Okay , well , I 'm trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dinsmoore have chapped lips ? " " Chapped lips ? I do n't know . " What kind of a question was that ? Was that going to the mode of death ? " Okay , and I 'm still trying to track down this red notebook . " As if to emphasize his statement , Ortega flipped open his own notebook .  | " Wait , what about chapped lips ? " " It 's nothing . " " But ? " Ortega bowed his head over his work and lifted one hand in a self-deprecating wave . " Really . I run down a lot of dead ends in this job . " " All right , what about the rental ads ? Did you call any of the numbers he 'd circled ? " " More dead ends . I 'm trying to understand what Mr. Dins-moore 's notes about his conversation with this Simon fellow meant . " He riffled through the pages , but I remembered the words as if I 'd just read them : " LC  --  told Simon latest gas tests wet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an engineer , " I said , hoping to end his line of inquiry before it really got started . " Geologists do n't know these things ? " That nettled . I wanted to tell him that geologists know almost everything there is to know in the universe , but I said , " Well , you see , geologists are sort of more interested in the rock that the oil and gas is in than the oil and gas itself . That 's how they do their bit , sort of like looking for a rabbit by looking for a likely place for a rabbit to make his home , rather than for the rabbit himself . Engineers take it from the opposite perspective ; they 're more interested in the oil and gas , and do n't care much about the rock . Did you ask Dave Smith about this ? " " Yes , he said he did n't know what the note meant . " " That sounds like a load of road apples to me . " " Okay , let 's see what a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does it mean when a gas is wet ? " He was n't going to let up . I smiled in spite of myself . He reminded me of a small South American animal called a kinkajou . My fifth-grade teacher had one as a pet . It was so soft and furry that I was pleased when it curled up in my lap and I thought it was being sweet when it put its little mouth around one of the small bones of my hand and began to gnaw gently . What I did n't understand until the teacher hastened to pull it away was that it had tremendously strong jaw muscles , and was reputed to keep chewing until it heard bones crack .  | Well , it could n't hurt to explain something that was in every textbook . " The gist of it is that , urn , the oil and gas in the reser-voir  --  you know , way underground  --  are at a much higher temperature and pressure than up at the surface . So when you raise the stuff up to the surface , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yeah , water is in the solid phase when it 's ice , in the liquid phase when it 's water , and in the gaseous phase when it 's steam . See ? So , hydrocarbons have the same sort of thing , only it 's a little more complicated , because water is just water  --  you know , H-two-O , always the same . Well , you see , hydrocarbons can be lots of things , the atoms arranged in chains , or rings , or  --  well , the point is we 're talking about zillions of different possible molecules , as long as the basic ingredients are hydrogen and carbon atoms . So gas ' can mean either the gas phase , or probably in this case he meant the short-chain hydrocarbons  --  like methane through butane . " " Like gas that comes out of the stove . " " Right . So if the hydrocarbon is in the gas phase at surface conditions , it 's called a gas ; if it 's a liquid , it 's called oil . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You drive around on it . " Ortega 's eyes danced . " I did n't know I 'd have a chemistry lesson today . But what I wanted to know is , what does it mean when a gas is wet ' ? " " Oh . Well , it sort of means that when you draw it to the surface , some liquid condenses out because you 've dropped the temperature and pressure . " " And some gasses are dry , meaning nothing condenses out . " " Right . " " Okay , what 's the gas like at Lost Coyote ? " That question caught in my craw . Here I was lecturing a police detective on organic chemistry , and I had n't had the brains to find out what kind of gas was coming out of the ground at Lost Coyote . I muttered , " I do n't know . " " Okay , maybe you 'll find out . " " Maybe . " " Thank you . "  | Mercifully , we were interrupted by another knock at the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partner on the doorstep . " Hi , remember me ? Lieutenant Flint . I 'm told my wandering partner is here . " He smiled and kind of bent the lower half of his face around , showing some astonishingly long teeth , but although his eyes looked friendly enough , the balance of his face looked paralyzed . In general , he would have been better off to settle for looking glum and ugly , rather than jovial and warped . " This way , Lieutenant . How do you take your coffee ? " " Oh , God . Is Ortega fraternizing with the civilians again ? I take cream . " " Will milk do ? " I muttered , leading him to the kitchen . Flint cuffed Ortega on the arm and said , " Morning , boss , you dumb spic . " Ortega beamed a friendly welcome . " Flint , you ugly thing , que pasa ? " " Nada mucho , " Flint said , in the lousiest attempt at Spanish I 've heard this side of Boston . I busied myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the two spoke quietly , but I could still make out their words : " So what you finding out , bro ? " " Miss Hansen here has been teaching me about hydrocarbons . It 's very interesting . " " Hah ? Who cares ? Let 's play a little good cop bad cop , get this case settled and the poor fellah buried , maybe even take the afternoon off . I 'm itching for nine holes of golf , nice day like this . " " You 'll play golf when I take up needlepoint , you old lounge lizard . " " Hah ? Nah , I 'm gon na take up bullfighting , show your lazy Mexican ass a few things . So what 's the skinny ? You over here telling the witness everything you know ? You gon na get thrown off the force yet , you keep this up . " " Still wondering about this red notebook thing . " " Nnnh . This kid 's straight , hah ? " " Miss Hansen ? Like new snow , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low for a moment , but I caught bits of it : " So what about this ... Tutar . . . car . . . all night ? " " Okay , well , but that 's . . . business . I just hope ... does n't get in trouble . " I went nuts trying to make out their words . It was obvious that not only had Ortega seen that I had a visitor , but he knew full well who that visitor was , and approximately when he left . " You guys always work on Sundays , or is this treatment special for me ? " I marched over to the table and set Flint 's coffee down . Hard . Some of the brew slopped onto his lap , and after he flinched , he smiled admiringly . Which totally blew my indignation . It 's hard for me to stay mad at someone who approves of me . Flint picked up his coffee , sucked at it noisily , and answered my question . " Nah , we do n't work Sundays unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days until we get it wrapped . " " You push this hard over a suicide ? " Flint and Ortega exchanged looks . Flint said , " We really ca n't talk about the case , ma'am . Ortega here has a big mouth . A real maverick . It gets him in lots of trouble . Right , gordo ? " Ortega rolled his eyes . " You were just about to tell me more about the gas at Lost Coyote , Miss Hansen . " " I do n't know anything more about it . You can call me Em . Flint here can call me Miss Hansen . " Flint warped his face into an appreciative grimace of a smile . " Okay , then , " said Ortega , carefully entering notes in his little book . " You have any other ideas for us ? " " No , " I said . " Right , " Flint said . " We best get on with it then , Carlos . Thanks for the coffee , Miss Hansen . " Rachel 's house was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that made up the bulk of the houses near Washing-  | ton Park . I 'd been told that Washington Park was the " in " place for the up-and-coming to live , and judging by the flashy duds on the joggers and bicyclists who huffed purposefully by , this was so . After spraying half a can of ether into the carburetor to get it started , I had n't had time to run Bill 's truck through a car wash , so I parked it a block away from Rachel 's house . Rachel came to the door wearing elegant gabardine slacks and a sweater the color of oatmeal . She gestured me in with her drink . " Em ; glad you could make it on such short notice . Libby 's on the verandah . This way . " I crossed a hardwood floor onto a thick Persian rug , passing mahogany and cherrywood antiques the likes of which I had n't seen this side of the Appalachians . On beyond the dining room , a pair of French doors stood wide , opening out onto a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threshold , I could see an arbor , heavy with clematis and flanked with a wild spray of late anemones . There , under the protective arch of the arbor , stood Libby Hopkins , as frail and beautiful as ever , her translucent alabaster skin flushed with the last dying heat of summer . As she saw me , she smiled , and came toward me with her arms extended for an embrace , the sun playing across the reddish lights in her crown of golden hair . She presented her greeting with great delicacy , like a butterfly lighting for one fragile moment on a tender flower . I smiled . The princess remembered me . Why had I never noticed her friendliness be-fore ? " Emmy , I 'm so glad you 're here , " she said . Her voice had n't changed in the years since I 'd seen her , either . It still held a strange , unexpected fullness , like a fruit that holds more flavor than its scent suggests . " Hi , Libby . It 's nice to see you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dining on eggs Florentine , hot crusty bread and imported marmalade . The coffee was strong and rich . It was a pleasant , easy meal , and for once I did n't even worry whether I was dropping an inordinate amount of crumbs around my plate . Rachel leaned back with a cigarette , abstractedly tipping the  | ash onto the wreckage of the half-eaten meal on her Wedgwood plate . She seemed lost in thought , presiding over the occasion with the patient disinterest of a runner jogging in place . By contrast , Libby 's attention seldom wandered . She had gazed straight at me throughout the meal . " Remember the weekends you came to stay with me from school ? " she was asking . " Yes , " I answered , partially lying . She had , in fact , only invited me once . Usually she took Rachel , or some other member of her tight coterie of friends . Even though I had presumed the invitation a perfunctory act of social obligation , set in motion by the social machinery my grandmother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me to bring my horse , and had stabled her next to hers in the barn . Her family 's estate outside Boston sprawled across a hillside , its crouching architecture glowering down an immense lawn toward a wonderful lake . We had rowed around and around the lake  --  I had rowed ; she was not as strong  --  and had then taken the horses out riding through the surrounding woodlands . " Remember that picnic we took to the big rock in the woods ? " she asked . She really does remember , I thought , amazed . " Yes . Your cook made great ham sandwiches . " " Yes , and Popsicles for dessert , but they had half melted , even though we wrapped them in towels next to a bag of ice . You showed me how to rig a saddlebag out of our rucksacks . " " Yes . " I began to smile at the memory . Yes , I remember that day . The leaves were turning . " How odd , to feel nostalgic for New England . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they 're turning now . They 're beautiful this year . " A hollow look passed across her face , but she chased it away with her fragile smile . " I went up into the mountains this morning , to see the aspens turning . But they 're not the same . " Her eyes focused on me again , with a sudden haunting depth . " Then later that day , remember , we set up bales of hay , and you showed me how to ride the barrels , and later how to rope the fence post . You were always so clever , Em . " Her smile was warm , her gaze intense .  | I felt elevated , almost drunk , first by the satisfactions of the evening before , and now by finding some kind of acceptance at last among my schoolmates . The snubbing I 'd received at work began to fade in importance , and bitter memories of being the girl who did n't fit in took on a sweeter quality , as if that were some other girl , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong and forgiven . In this sentimental glow , I tried on the notion that we were all mature now , that old slights and prejudices could be set aside . On both sides , I thought , realizing that I had n't exactly broken my neck to please these people . Had that been my sin ? How odd , to find out Libby has always liked me . Why have I never noticed ? Was she more shy than I realized , afraid to declare herself until now ? Have I failed her somehow , never giving her the friendship she wanted ? I moved to meet her kindness . I said , " Then after dinner , we sat up telling stories . Remember that ? We told scarier and scarier stories , and got more and more afraid to go to sleep , and it got later and later , and your dad came in and he told us more stories . " Rachel shifted suddenly in her chair , as if she had a cramp . She stared fixedly at something visible only to her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes , the stories , " said Libby . She took Rachel 's hand , and held it to her cheek . " Remember Daddy 's stories , Rachel ? " Rachel pulled her hand away . " Right . Let 's move inside , shall we ? We can have our sherbert where the sun wo n't strike it . " Abruptly , she rose and headed for the kitchen . Libby rose more slowly , picking her dishes up with great care , the action apparently absorbing every gram of her atten-tion . I was left alone in the garden , staring at the way crumbs stuck to the streaks of egg yolk on my plate , the smear and chaos coating the delicate design . Over tea and sherbert , the conversation began anew . " I hear you 're working at Blackfeet , " Libby said . " How do you like it ? " " Fine , " I replied . " How did you know where I work ? " Libby leaned against me and grasped my arm . She said , " Is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , " I said , trying to get my bearings in this new turn in the conversation . " Is n't it strange that Scott and Gerry should both die like that , so close together ? " Libby continued . " Do n't you think so , Rachel ? " Rachel did n't answer . At least not verbally ; she did get up and pour herself a shot of bourbon . Libby followed her with her eyes . I pounced on the topic . " I think it 's strange , all right . Just how did they know each other ? " " At college , " said Libby . " They were roommates for a year at Haverford , before Scott moved into the fraternity house . You know , when I was at Bryn Mawr . " The next town , I thought . At last , here was a chance to ask someone about Gerald Luftweiller . Someone who actually knew him . " Did you know him well ? I mean Gerald . Did he study accounting at Haverford ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew him through Scott . Scott and I dated a bit . Just out to a movie now and then . " Rachel began to pace . " What was Gerald like ? " I persisted . " Nervous . " " What do you mean , nervous ? " " Well ? " Libby began , but Rachel broke in . " He was n't very stable , Em . " Her tone warned me to stop asking questions . What 's the connection ? Is there a connection ? I scanned all I knew about Gerald Luftweiller , which was precious little . My mind ricocheted around the events of the last few days , eventually climbing the stairs to the sixteenth floor from my office in the Cattlemen 's Exchange Building , where it dithered over the broken window before heading into the offices of Love and Chris-tiansen . And remembered Simon , the mysterious phone caller , who maybe worked at Love and Christiansen . " Do you guys know Simon , too ? " I asked , hoping that Libby did not . If she did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up his messages from his secretary .  | " Oh my God , Simon , " Rachel muttered , and poured herself another drink . " Do you mean Simon Bunting ? " asked Libby . " Ah  --  the Simon at Love and Christiansen . " " That 's him . " I almost spat out my tea . " What does Simon do for Love and Christiansen ? " " He 's an engineer , " Libby answered . " He majored in engineering , just like Scott . I think they were even fraternity brothers . They roomed together senior year , then Simon came out here and took a master 's at Colorado School of Mines . " " And Gerald Luftweiller ? " Libby smiled coyly , as if I 'd asked her a slightly naughty question . " Gerry was a year behind them at Haverford . He tried to pledge their fraternity , but he was n't chosen . " For some reason , Rachel again dropped the headsman 's axe on the conversation . " Let 's talk about something else , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than usual . Libby cast a quick , measuring glance her way and rose to her feet . " I had n't noticed the time , " she said sweetly . " I must run along . Rachel , thank you for a lovely meal , dear . " She gave her a tiny kiss on the cheek . " Emmy , we must get together again , now that I know you 're here . How can I reach you ? " " I 'm staying with ? " " Oh , but of course , I can phone you at work . How silly of me . I look forward . " She wrapped her slender arms around my neck and squeezed , surprising me again with the warmth of her farewell . Grabbing her pocketbook , she headed quickly out the door . I moved to follow , offering hurried thanks , but Rachel cut me off , gripping my arm at the biceps . " Watch out , " she said , glaring at me . I recoiled . " Watch out for what ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fury disappearing as quickly as it had appeared . Her eyes sank back toward the bottle of bourbon . I was dismissed . I again tried to thank her , but when she did n't respond , I closed the door behind myself and headed down the block to Bill 's truck .  | I was just firing up its hefty V-8 engine when a car pulled up next to me . It was a blue Saab , and my heart quickened as I thought for a moment that it might be Pete . The window slid smoothly down into the door , eliminating the glare that divided me from a view of the driver . It was Libby . " How about lunch some day this week ? " she caroled . " I wanted to invite you in there , but Rachel was getting into such an ugly mood . " " What got her going ? " " I do n't know . Rachel 's my closest friend , but I ca n't say I understand her . Now , about lunch ... " " Sure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I 'll come get you at your office . " " You do n't need to do that . I can meet you somewhere . My office is way up on the twelfth floor , and it costs a mint to park ? " She smiled . " I know exactly where it is , and besides ? " " Libby , how is it you know where I 'm working ? I do n't remember telling you , or Rachel , for that matter . " " My husband told me . He works at Blackfeet , too . I can just zip into the garage and park the car " ? she wiggled the monthly pass ticket that hung from the rearview mirror ? " and leave it there while we eat . It 's where I always park when I come downtown on a weekday . See you then . " The window slid back up into place and the Saab pulled away . As it rolled past , I saw that its back seat was folded down . A bright branch of yellow aspen leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Libby . Elizabeth . Libby ; of course , a nickname for Elizabeth . So many of us were letting go of girlhood nicknames , now that we were grown . Elizabeth Tutaraitis ? No , Elizabeth Hopkins ; why take a surname one could n't spell , especially in this day and age ? A pair of earnest joggers panted past the truck , a miscellaneous flash of fluorescent spandex lodging somewhere in my memory . Stunned , I sat staring through the windshield at noth-  | ing , as the great truck engine mindlessly idled , pumping blue exhaust into the rarified Denver air . I considered packing up and heading home to the ranch . Even my mother seemed tame after what I had run into in those first two weeks in Denver . Winter was coming ; surely Dad needed help with the cattle . Hey , he was getting older , right ? Did n't he need me more than ever ? Perhaps Mother would n't even ask why the little geologist was showing up so soon , calling up without warning from the bus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suits . " Get a grip on yourself , " I muttered aloud , as I muscled the big old truck into Elyria 's driveway . " You ca n't quit after only two weeks . So what if ? " If what ? If it takes you twelve years to figure out Libby likes you , and now you find you 've just slept with her husband ? I hurried out of the truck and stumbled through the house , into the living room , where I flopped onto the living room couch and squeezed my eyes shut . I could n't get it together to cry it out , and if I had , I was n't sure what I would have cried about , as the selection of humiliations seemed limitless . My mind trotted out one unkind image after another : me , laughable in business clothing ; me in the committee room , pretending to be a geologist ; me at lunch with Pete , making an ass of myself , sucking up Udon noodles like a sow , not even smart enough to check his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could he lie to me like that ? She had n't left him ; she was there , waiting for him at home . Or did he know that ? Did n't Rachel say Libby had just come back ? Yes , that must be it . I switched on the message playback on the answering machine , hoping it was Pete with some wild explanation of events , but another voice broke the silence of the room , deep and  | rough and uncertain : " Urn  --  hi , Em . Ah , this is Frank . Yeah , I guess you know that . I 'm , ah  --  not used to these answering things . Give me a call , okay ? " Frank , oh no . . . . I tried to comfort myself that at least I still had good , kind , dependable , moody old Frank . But my body wanted Pete . I felt too guilty to even think of calling Frank back . As I sat there trying to figure out what to do about him , the phone rang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was dear old Grannie phoning from Boston . " Emily , have you gotten together with your classmates as I suggested ? " Yeah , and with their husbands . " Yes , Grandmother , I have . " " With Rachel Conant , and the Warren girl ? " At least I had this one frail accomplishment to report , but my tone sounded dead even to me . " Yeah , and I just saw Rachel again . She had me to brunch with Libby Hopkins . " " The Hopkins girl ? How lovely . She 's in Denver ? Why , she just came to tea on Friday . Heavens , that was only two days ago . You 'll remember her grandmother , Anne Kilbourne ; she 's one of my oldest friends . Libby is her only grandchild . Anne usually comes on Wednesday , but Libby was n't available . " As my grand-mother 's voice took on a harsh note of complaint , I quit listening . What had she said ? They had tea on Friday ? Then Libby only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was coming , did n't expect her to return . I said , " Really ? Friday ? The day before yester-day ? " " Yes , Emily ; I 'm not senile . In my day , it was two days by train to Denver , and the track was uneven west of Chicago . " My grandmother had no use for the West , other than as a compass direction to disregard . She spoke of it very seldom , as if my mother 's elopement to Wyoming was caught in the emotional amber of the railroad age . " It 's just a four-hour flight now , Grandmother , " I said , struggling to keep my voice level . " And from the airport , it 's barely two hours ' drive north to Chugwater , " I added , daring to remind her that she had never visited us on the ranch . After a pause , my grandmother 's voice came back over the line , placing the subject firmly back where she wanted it . " Libby  | seemed so terribly interested in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Libby only knew . " How nice . " " Yes , such a pleasant girl . You 'd do well to cultivate her friendship , you know . She 's very well connected . I always thought her father beneath Anne Kilbourne 's family , but perhaps he has some redeeming qualities after all ; he set those children up quite well . It all but broke Anne 's heart to have Libby gone so far away , but the dear girl does get back to visit quite often . " Had Libby 's " desertion " been one of her frequent visits to see her grandmother ? " How nice , " I muttered . " Really , Emily , you 're such a sullen girl . Now , the reason for my call : I hear that Barbara Dinsmoore 's nephew Scott died this week . You might have known him at school . He was living out west somewhere . Do send her a note , wo n't you ? It 's important to make the right gesture . It will help her in her grief . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was n't just out here somewhere . He was living right here , in Denver . He was working at Blackfeet , with me . " My grandmother 's voice dropped in volume , its martial fire diminishing in a hush of discomfort . " Oh , my poor dear , I did n't know . " " Right . " There was silence on the other end of the line . I waited a moment , listening to my breath on the receiver , then told her that I had to get off the phone . " Good-bye , Emily , " she said . For the first time in my knowledge of her , she sounded old and frail . I took the bicycle west along Thirty-second Avenue , riding high up a rise to a place where I could see the mountains of the Front Range and the clouds above them , and finally had my cry . Monday morning , the dog and I were both so disconsolate that I almost ate his pill for him . Late for the bus again , I staggered in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went straight for the coffee room . I then retreated to my office  | and pretended to read the Lost Coyote well files for the better part of an hour , at which time the entire office headed down Broadway for Scott 's memorial service . I dawdled behind the crowd , putting off my next meeting with Pete as long as I could . I was most of a block behind him , trailing along with the secretaries in spike heels , when I realized that Pete was making this very easy for me . He never glanced around . My heart weighted my chest like a rock . St. Andrew 's Episcopal was a somber grey stone affair with the usual stained-glass saints rolling their humble eyes heavenward . After several minutes of fairly nice organ music , the priest made his entrance . He could n't have been much past thirty , judging by his full head of limp brown hair and flawless skin , but his jaw was locked in pompous irritability , and he moved up the aisle as rigidly as a man of ninety . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his voice swelled and swooped weirdly out of synchronization with his words , and it was obvious from what he chose to say that he had never met Scott . As the hymns and testimonies rumbled on , I scanned through the dim atmosphere of the church , trying to place all the mourners . Libby sat with Rachel and Topsy on the right side of the aisle , serenely heading the group of social acquain-tances . J. C. Menken and Dave Smith sat at the front of the Blackfeet group , looking noble . They had established their importance by arriving at the last minute , sliding up to the curb in Menken 's Mercedes-Benz instead of walking with the rest of us . Smith was as unreadable as ever , but nonetheless clearly commanded the surviving engineers , who huddled in a silent knot right behind him . The rest of Blackfeet 's personnel sat in clots along the left side of the aisle . Clots . My mind moved spasmodically to the image of that strange something  --  Scottie  --  dropping past the glass in the Cattlemen 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye like a small dim window flickering open in a velvet darkness . I rubbed my hand over my eyes , trying to squeeze that window shut , but it flicked open again and again .  | When I opened my eyes , I was staring at the back of Pete 's neck . He had seated himself on the left side of the aisle with the Blackfeet crew , next to Maddie . He leaned toward her and whispered something . She rotated her head toward him and screwed her nose up like he stank , and chewed her gum . My attention drifted to a fellow who sat immediately behind the last of the Blackfeet engineers , crammed up against the aisle as if he was n't sure whether he was a friend or a colleague , his broad shoulders looming high above the back of the pew . He had a turret shaped head crowned with thick , closely cropped blond curls . Had I seen him somewhere before ? There was something familiar about him . No , I figured , second-guessing myself , he 's just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozen guys just like him at prep school . But something about him kept catching my eye : each time he turned profile to glance at my old classmates , I found myself watching him . Preppius americanus var. boyjockus , I mused . Common name , pinhead locker room stud . Thinks he 's God 's gift ; a dime a dozen . In my mind 's eye , I rigged him up in lacrosse gear with vicious stick and heavy gloves , tiny pig eyes peering out through the wire face cage of the helmet . The service began to wind toward its merciful end . At the first moment that could remotely be construed as polite , I made my move toward the door and the bright air of outdoors where I could breathe and make a run for my office , but as I passed through the vestibule , I spied two familiar forms ahead of me in the doorway . Lieutenant Flint creased the lower half of his face in his **30;59;TOOLONG grin as he moved calmly toward a new post outside the entrance of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presumed , he could breathe down each mourner 's neck . Sergeant Ortega moved more quickly , positioning himself farther out on the sidewalk where he could observe the gathering with strategic ease . When he saw me , he bowed gravely from the waist . I decided to stick around , but moved over to an inconspicuous position at one side of the entrance where I would n't have to cross paths with either Pete or Libby .  | Abruptly , the mourners disgorged from the church , but upon reaching the sidewalk , they milled about in confusion . They had no central mourner to file past , no script indicating how to behave next . I watched as the tall blond jock type tried to figure out what to do with himself , and the longer I watched him , the more certain I was that I 'd seen him before . Suddenly , he leaned forward and grabbed the arm of the person next to him to mutter something I could n't hear . Bingo . I 'd seen that gesture before . Recently . This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day I had lunch with Rachel and Topsy . The day after Scott died . Who was he ? As I pondered that , mourners continued to ooze from the church . As they idled on the sidewalk , I could have sworn I saw a chain reaction of pregnant glances , precipitated as Libby alighted on the sidewalk , flanked by Rachel and Topsy . The tur-ret-headed blond man straightened up and stared nastily at Libby , who averted her eyes sadly toward Rachel . Rachel scorched the guy with a single , telegraphic glare . The guy wheeled on Pete , who was just wandering out with his hands in his pockets . Pete gave him a Who , me ? kind of shrug and glanced at Fred Crick . Crick stared helplessly at Smith . Smith fixed his stare hard on Pete , who gave him the same amount of notice he would if he were waiting for a bus in a crowd of strangers . Then the receptionist joined the scene . She tripped daintily as she crossed the threshold of the church and froze her delicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pete , Libby , Rachel , and me in turn . As I was trying to sort out this sequence of nonverbal communications , Menken strode out into the sun and squinted , thrust a hand inside his suit jacket for his sunglasses , and occupied himself with applying them to his face . All eyes turned to him , waiting for him to climb into his Mercedes , so they could politely leave . Ortega and Flint nodded genteelly to each mourner in turn . The other members of the office wandered around , muttering things that sounded appropriate while they waited for Menken to make a move .  | The tension finally got the better of me . The whole revolting mess , and every person involved with it , had my stomach churning . I moved to the edge of the crowd and turned away . And spotted one more person who was casting pregnant stares upon the multitude . There by the end of the building , in all his wild sartorial splendor , stood the strange man the police had spirited out of the parking garage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up against the stone as if for warmth , taking in the spectacle like it was some of his own brand of street theater . What was his name ? Archie Arch , that was what Ortega had called him . I turned , caught Ortega 's eye , and tipped my head toward Archie . Ortega lowered his eyelids slowly and raised them again , an unmistakable signal that he had the guy well fixed on his radar screen . The crowd milled , more and more ill at ease , but still no one broke loose and started the flow back north to the office . It seemed they were waiting for some signal from Menken , who stood smiling in the midst of the miasma , apparently thriving on the high energy of emotional chaos . The muscles at the back of my neck tightened . I was just contemplating hurling a parking meter into the throng when Topsy broke the tension for me : releasing her grip on Libby , she threw herself at the man with the turret-shaped head and the Aryan curls , hugged him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Simon , what 's it like to lose your best friend in the whole world ? " So this obstruction is Simon Bunting , eh ? I thought , as I squeezed past well-clothed elbows . I want to talk to you , Bubba . I was two strides from the wrestling match between Simon and Topsy when a hand closed on my elbow . Firmly . I spun around , and was surprised to find that the strong grip belonged to J. C. Menken . He drew me backward , extracting me from the crowd . He said , " Emily , let me give you a ride . "  | At the curb , Dave Smith was waiting for Menken to unlock the car door for him . At the sight of me , his gaze turned hard as stone . Menken opened the door to the Mercedes and helped me in . Smith waited , expecting Menken to at least unlock a back door for him , but Menken climbed into the driver 's seat , pressed a button to open the sunroof , gunned the motor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smith 's eyes boring into me just as if he were pressing at my skull with a thumb . Menken spoke in a confidential tone : " I 'm sure this is very difficult for you , coming to work for us , and then losing one of your colleagues so suddenly . You 've hardly had a chance to get used to us , and here you are in the midst of our grief . " Menken sounded positively lucid . It gave me the crawly sensation an antelope must experience when a coyote shifts a little closer to it , approaching from downwind . " Thank you , sir , " I mumbled . " Who were all those people in the church ? You seemed to know some of them . " " Friends of Scott 's from school . " " Tell me about them , " he said . " I do n't really know them , " I lied . The last thing I wanted was to be Menken 's ambassador to this mare 's nest of intertwined relationships . The Mercedes boomed into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concrete until Menken closed the sunroof . He pulled smoothly into a space right next to the door on the main level . No subbasement for this man . I suffered two more minutes of his prying as the elevator swallowed us and raised us to the twelfth floor , but as soon as we hit Blackfeet 's lobby , Irma Triff mercifully cut off the conversation with a pile of pink While You Were Out phone message slips . I ducked into the women 's room and took a roost , hoping to evade detection until everyone was back at their desks and settled down . Wrong strategy . A few minutes later , the receptionist came in . I watched her delicate ankles under the divider as she pointed her little toes toward the neighboring porcelain god ,  | genuflected , and offered up her breakfast . As she retreated to the sink and rinsed her mouth , the outside door opened again and in they came , the whole raucous Greek chorus of gossiping girl engineers and geologists . " ... see Menken move on Hansen ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his new toy ? " Peals of laughter . " Maybe that 's how she got the job . " I pulled my feet up onto the seat , but it was too late : I heard a swat and more laughter , as one of them lowered her voice and said , " What if that 's her in that stall ? " The door groaned open and their giggles moved into the hall . I counted to sixty and stormed back to my office . So that 's what they think , huh ? They think the little twit without the master 's degree is such a retard she has to fuck for a living , huh ? I 'll show them a thing or two . Watch this . Plopping into my chair , I gave Maddie a nasty look and grabbed a stack of well logs . Maddie popped her eyes at me and stuck a finger into her cheek . " Something y'all et ? " she drawled . " Yeah : shit . " I flipped open the first fan-folded log . The long squiggly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but by God , I was going to stare at it until it sang a full octave . " Sure , sweetums , " I heard Maddie say , as I screwed my mind to the log , " but was it good shit ? " The first log meant nothing to me . In exasperation , I folded it back up and arranged the logs on top of my desk and stared at them , daring them to spill the beans about the field . The swine just lay there , each little fan-folded stack baring only its header , which primly listed well name , location , and other statistics of no earth-shattering importance . I contemplated threatening them with a match . But wait , one was subtly different . I smiled at my old trick of noticing the one that did n't quite conform to pattern : the information on its header was filled in by hand , in contrast to the sterile sans-serif typeface the others presented to the world . Scrawled across the top of the header were the words field print . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preliminary copies of the logs printed right in the logging trailer in the field . I flipped it open , and found nirvana : some marvelous log-  | ging engineer had marked the tops and bottoms of all the rock formations from surface down through the sandstone I had been trying to recognize . With this information , I at last had a handle with which to open the door to understanding Lost Coyote Field . About then , Fritz tossed the morning report onto my desk . It slid across my logs and into my lap , scattering paper and pencils onto the floor . I sat up for a moment and blinked . Maddie smiled at him and made kissy lips . All the morning report had to say about Lost Coyote Field was that the rig was drilling merrily away , engineer or no . I made a note of the progress in the well file . Then I jittered for about five minutes , wondering what I was going to do with the well logs now that I had the Rosetta Stone . It was like pulling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to read : knowing which wiggle was the " pay " interval was great , but to make sense of the correlation , I still had to know something about the geometry of the sandstone . I needed a conceptual model to start with , a template to compare with what I saw on the logs . That was where the papers I 'd been reading were supposed to come in . I opened one that showed a map of the geography of Wyoming as it hypothetically appeared ninety million years ago , and dove in . I mean literally . Eastern Wyoming was under water at the time . The middle of the continent had warped downward during that epoch , inundating the Great Plains with a shallow sea . Seas have waves . Waves move sand along the shoreline , forming beaches . Beach sand makes highly permeable sandstones , which make wonderful petroleum reservoirs if they happen to wind up buried under , say , a shale or a limestone , and a few thousand feet of other sediments . " Maddie , " I said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a beach sand ? " " Naw , I think that far west you 're in the fluvial facies . " That brought me up short . Maddie had just spoken genuine geologese , cluing me in that this sandstone had been deposited by the river that flowed from the highlands to the sea , not by  | the waves that swept along the shore . The beach sands would be farther east . And then I could see it : the log showed me thick lenses of sandstone laid down in the changeable channels of a river , encased in shales deposited as part of the adjacent floodplain . Sandstone , shale , sandstone , shale . Channel , bank , channel , bank . It was like opening my eyes and really seeing for the first time . In my excitement , I forgot to be blase . " Maddie ! This is great ! Show me how to correlate this stuff . " Maddie hopped up from her chair and came over to my desk . " The only trick 's in figuring out where one channel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is somewhat erratic , geometrically speaking , kind of like lace . Look : the sandstone signature in these two wells  --  this big blocky-looking hummer  --  match up pretty well . That 's your gravy boat . " She fished through the stack of logs for the next well to the west . " Here it is in the next hole . " She traced the curve of the log signature with her finger . " See ? It 's got a nose on it like Jimmy Durante , real distinctive . " The curve swung to the right , then the left . " Then over here it 's getting thinner , just like you 'd expect at the edge of the channel . " Maddie then showed me how to slide the logs up and down to make a correlation , using idiosyncrasies in the shale signatures above and below to confirm the match in the sandstones . " Y'all got it . You 're a natural , " she declared , punching me in the shoulder . She went back to her desk and sat down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at clean sand forty feet thick , permeable as hell and chock-full of oil and gas . It 's a barn-burner . " Pulling a new stick of gum out of the lap drawer of her desk , she mugged at me briefly and went back to work . Using Maddie 's techniques , I tacked the well logs up on the wall , where I could see them better . Then I rearranged them this way and that , stepping back to check my work . Suddenly I saw something very interesting . The biggest river channel sandstone in the field , the one that was producing most of the gas , was really thick right in the middle of the field , and then in the next well to the west it was a bit thinner but just as good a producer , then there was the well that was drilling , and then  | Then the edge of the field . Or was it the edge ? I glanced back at the map . There was another well I could patch in to the correlation , a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Where was the log for that one ? I dug through the remaining logs . It was n't there . I looked for its well file . Ditto . The fifty-million-dollar question was , how far did the sandstone go ? Did it peter out between the existing well and our new well ? The wells farther north and south were okay , but no barn-burners , as Maddie said . Had the existing wells already defined the edge of the field ? Or was the sandstone as thick to the west ? We 'd want to find out , right ? And the way to find out was to drill a new well , right ? If we hit the sandstone in the new well , it was likely to be the best producer in the field . So why the debate about drilling the new well ? And where the hell was that log ? I left my work spread out on my desk and headed for the elevator . The vault madam was in residence . I gave her a big smile . " When I came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had for Lost Coyote ? " I asked . She coughed and nodded her head . " Could you double-check ? " Her face pursed up like she was trying to swap her mouth for her nose . " Please ? " I smiled as sweetly as I knew how , loading on the charm with a trowel . She lurched off of her stool and shuffled slowly toward the back of the file room . While she searched , I riffled back through her sign-out book again , this time reading the column that listed what was signed out . Nothing . Nada . I was the only one other than Scott who had checked anything out from Lost Coyote in months . The woman returned , shaking her head . I thanked her profusely , and headed upstairs . As the elevator yanked me upward through the bowels of the building , I wracked my memory for the second time , trying to remember the color of the tab on the  | file Pete had been carrying . Well , even if it was orange , it could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then why did he have a Wyoming file at all , if he was California ? I wondered if I had the nerve to go ask him . It occurred to me that Scott might have had the files . I tried to remember if there were any logs on his desk when I was looking for the red notebook . Maybe it was the well he 'd been testing , I thought , as I got out of the elevator and hurried down the hall . Maybe he just forgot to sign it out . The hallway seemed to have grown in length , dangerously long , and I wanted to duck into Scott 's office before anyone saw me . I broke into a run , and grabbed the door frame as I banked the curve into his office . There was someone sitting behind Scott 's desk : my old pal Sergeant Ortega . " I 'm the bad penny , huh ? " he said , smiling merrily . I had evidently interrupted him while he was going through the lap drawer with a pair of tweezers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ortega bowed his head sadly and looked at his hands . " I do n't want to get you in trou-ble , " he said , in his soft song of a voice . I stopped . What was he looking for ? He gestured at the open drawer . " Just grasping for straws , " he explained . " You never know what you 're going to find . " I stepped back into the room , dodging to one side of the doorway where I could n't be seen from the hall , and craned my neck , trying to get a look inside the drawer . Ortega straightened up in Scott 's chair and grinned at me . He was clearly enjoying himself . This was one detective who would chase a dead man 's ghost forever if he had to , just to learn the cause of death . I was beginning to find his onepointed focus almost soothing , as simple as the appeal of drawing close to a warm , well-tended hearth on a cold night . " What were you looking for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now beaming . " I was looking for a well log , " I said , drawing closer to the desk . " And the well file that went with it . "  | Ortega shook his head . " I do n't think it 's here . What do they look like ? " I tried to explain , gesturing with my hands as to size , and describing the manila file with its orange tab . " No , definitely no file with an orange tab , and no log . Why do you want them ? " I was just trying to decide whether it was okay to tell him , when I heard a loud clearing of throat from behind me . I spun around . And found Dave Smith , an inch and a half away . Smith 's eyes were narrow , opaque , but his voice was smooth . " Say , Em , could you come to my office for just a moment ? " he asked . He rotated toward Ortega . " Sorry to interrupt , Sergeant , but I must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affably . My stomach contracting into a knot , I turned and followed Smith down the hall , marveling once again at the lack of animation in his carriage . Once we were inside his office , Smith closed the door and indicated a seat for me across the desk from him . He sat down and gazed steadily at me . " What did you want to see me about , sir ? " I asked , unconsciously slipping into prep school manners . Smith continued his unblinking stare , a cobra frightening its prey into paralysis . I waited for him to speak . And waited . As the seconds ticked past with no reply , it became clearer and clearer that this was a conscious attempt to intimidate me . And a successful one . When every last muscle in my body had stiffened , he finally said , " You 're new here , Em , and I 'm concerned that no one has spent enough time orienting you to company policies . " The words were solicitous , but the tone was icy . " Has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hmm ? "  | No one needed to , damn it . " It 's vitally important that we keep company matters within the company . " " Yes , I know that , " I snapped . He continued as if I had n't said anything . " We must maintain Blackfeet 's edge over the competition . Y'see , Em , a casual comment here or there could cause us considerable damage if overheard by the wrong party . Even mentioning your work to someone else in this company , say , over lunch down the street ; why , it could be overheard by a competitor . " His eyes had not left mine since we 'd sat down . I tried to return his stare , wondering what there was in the presence of the police that worried him so . Certainly not just the idea that a freshman geologist might be indiscreet with proprietary infor-mation ? " Take Lost Coyote Field , as an example . You may think , why , this is a development project , what 's the danger ? Well , Em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy regarding their operation and our interpretation of the geology of the field are not . " He paused for emphasis . " Now , Em , we understand that you want to come up to speed as a geologist , being new in from mudlogging " ? he paused again , rubbing this in ? " and of course , you want to know the field . But you also want to keep an eye toward maximizing your efficiency . This is really a very simple field , fully contained stratigraphically , and it 's given us no real problems . One of our best producers , as a matter of fact . The engineering staff have it well in hand . " He turned a great flat palm upward on his desk top as he delivered his final blow . " So you 'll spend no further time on it at present . " " But ? " " But what , Em ? " But there 's nothing else for me to do around here . And what the hell do you mean , the engineers have it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And if it 's such a simple little field , why do you care who knows it ? He had n't blinked or looked away from me since he 'd sat  | down . I tried to stare back at him in defiance , but could not . I began to squirm in my chair . What a filthy trick , I thought furiously . Do n't his eyes dry out ? " Good , " he said , his tone now fully glacial . " You 're a smart girl ; I knew you 'd understand . I 've had Fritz collect the files for Lost Coyote from your office . " I was wasting time thinking , I 'm not a girl , you sorry piece of shit , I am a full-grown and very angry woman , when it hit me : this monster had just taken my work away from me , had stolen it right off of my desk . " You what ? " I shouted . I stared straight into his nasty eyes . " Listen , I was in the middle of ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this investigation is closed , Miss Hansen . " His voice darkened to a low rumble as he delivered his final words : " Let this stand as a warning to you . That is all . " He flicked his fingertips at me , imbedding his threat with the insult of dismissal . I stood , suddenly aware of what little armor business clothes afford the flesh . I backed toward the door . His words had done their damage : I had no idea what the company policy was on these things , and his tactics had rocked me hard enough that I was already scrutinizing myself for error . I turned and left his office . I headed straight for Fred Crick 's office . I would demand my right to do my job . His door was closed . I knocked ; no answer . The geology secretary advised me that Crick would be gone until the middle of next week . " Where is he ? " I asked . " Tulsa . " " Can I reach him there ? " " Well , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She eyed me ner-vously . Could n't these people see that I was just a normal honest person trying to make a living ? Or was honesty not normal in the oil business ? All at once I realized that I was n't even sure what I was going to say or ask if I had found Fred Crick , considering his management style . Or lack of . " No , I guess it can wait . "  | Deflated , I dragged myself down the hall to my office . But when I got there and saw empty space where my only decent work had been , rage swelled within me all over again . I spun on my heel and stared at Maddie . " Is this really standard operating procedure , to take someone 's work away just like that ? " I demanded , pointing at the wall . " Do what , honey ? " I could have smacked her . " This business of taking my work down without asking me is do what . This business of telling me to work on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This business of telling me that my opinion does n't count for shit , that the engineers can do ' the geology for me is goddamn do what . Honey . " " Do n't look at me , sweetie pea . " She widened her eyes like she did n't know what I was talking about . " I jus ' works here , massuh . I be a good geol'gis ' , massuh ; I do n't make no trouble . " " Oh come on , McNutt , engineers are just number crunchers . The data have to get in a straight line and salute before those guys get the picture . They ca n't do geology ; maybe they can spot crude oil five falls out of ten when they find it in a stock tank , but they do n't know sandstone from Shinola . Shit . They could n't find their asses with both hands and a road map . " It was quite a speech . It impressed even me . Maddie draped herself across her desk top and batted her eyelashes at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Great . So where the fuck were you when they were taking my work down ? Get serious , Maddie . " Maddie straightened up very slowly , flipping her long-suffering eraser up and down in one hand . I lasted a whole ten seconds in that staring match , too . I sat down , completely out of steam . Confrontation is n't my long suit , and Maddie was n't even the person I needed to confront . In a very small voice , I asked , " What 's going on here , Maddie ? " Maddie folded her arms tightly across her chest and stared out the window for a moment . In a soft little drawl , she said , " A girl needs to watch her ass around this man 's oil patch , honey pie . "  | " But Maddie , they took my only assignment away from me . If they do n't want me to do the work , then why did they hire me ? " " Got me , buck-o . " " I was starting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maddie shrugged . " Crick 's out of the office . Should I go to Menken ? " " Aw , c'm on , Emmy , do n't do that . Y'all might interrupt one of his real estate deals . " " His what ? " She tossed up her hands . " He 's on the phone most of the time , wheeling and dealing in real estate . " Her voice trailed off . She leaned back and closed her eyes in meditation . " Real estate ? " I asked . I watched her a while , fascinated at this new person emerging from within the bouncy , bombproof exterior . By and by she sat up , blinked her eyes , and yawned , as if she were just waking up from a heavy sleep . " Menken 's on company business for state occasions like hirings and firings and committee meetings only , " she said , her tone crisply matter-of-fact . " Then maybe I should call a committee meeting . " " See ? Now , that 's exactly what I mean . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She laughed dryly , shaking her head . " Em , honey , y'all 's got it wrong . Y'all think a committee meeting 's a place where Menken and the boys listens to folks and makes decisions . Y'all been living out there in the oil fields with the boys so long that you think you 're one of the boys . Worse yet , you think they think like you think , all straightforward and reasonable like . Wake up , honey bun . The fact of life is , they do most of their serious business in the Gents ' . " " In the what ? " " The latrines . They aims their whizzers at the porcelain and talks turkey . " " Shit , " I said . Maddie smiled . " No , mostly just shakin ' the dew off the lily , standing there straight up for ease of comparing lengths . " She held her hands up about three inches apart and pondered this image a moment , snapping her gum thoughtfully . " They pro'ly  | save the full squat for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sweet peach , at least you got a job ! " With that benediction , she hunkered down over her desk and went back to work , whistling a little Hank Williams riff . I stared at the top of her head , wishing things were as clear to me , or that I could manage life as easily as she . My eyes sagged shut with a fatigue that was painful . In the darkness behind my eyelids , I saw Scott flailing past me in his last instant of life , but this time there were threads connected to his hands and feet , like a ghastly marionette . The image played again and again , demanding that I put him to rest in the cold , damp body of the earth . In panic I opened my eyes . The room seemed stark , too brightly lit . All at once , I could see the price of playing it safe to keep this job , and that price was entirely too dear . Where in hell had I gotten the idea I could cooperate with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And by God , I would n't . A strange calm settled over me . I knew that Maddie , in her dependable way , would rise from her desk shortly after five , toss down her eraser , scratch her stomach , and head for home . I waited quietly , my hand resting palms-upward in my lap . When she had left , I pulled the phone book off the bookshelf , looked up the number I needed , and dialed . A brisk , martial voice answered : " Denver Police . " " Homicide , " I said . " Sergeant Ortega , please . " Ortega presented himself at Elyria 's at eight P.M. sharp . He smiled kindly as he stepped through the front door , and nodded hopefully toward the kitchen . " Sure , " I said . " Coffee 's just the thing . Or would you prefer something stronger ? " Ortega sighed . " Coffee . I 'm on du-ty , " he sang . He passed  | through the living room and stepped politely over the dog , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the kitchen . Ortega sat down at the round wooden table by the stove and pulled out his battered notebook . I appreciated his getting right down to business . It gave me room to be just as direct , and not waste mental energy on some attempt at social niceties . I put the kettle on to boil and sat down across from him . " So , Sergeant , this is murder , not suicide , right ? " Ortega nodded . " Will you tell me how you know ? " He smiled wanly . " Okay . Okay , if you 'll tell me how you know . " I studied Ortega carefully , trying to decide what I could tell him . I was no longer a child , who could look at a problem as if it were all black or white : Scottie might be dead , but everyone else at Blackfeet was still alive and trying to make a living in an increasingly difficult world . Who was I to open up company business , risking putting even one of them out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the workings of Lost Coyote Field until I truly understood them , and make my best judgment from there . " Listen , I 'm in a bad position . There are things that have me wondering , but I do n't even know if they have anything to do with Scottie 's death . " Ortega smiled . " Try me . " " No , they would n't mean anything to you anyway . They 're technical matters . I know you can subpoena me , or whatever it is you do , but that still wo n't get you anywhere , because I do n't understand these things myself , and anyone else at Blackfeet will just tell you I 'm imagining things , or too new at my job . But I will promise you this : I 'm working as fast as I can , and when I do understand them , I 'll tell you everything that has a bearing on Scott 's death . " Ortega considered this . " That 's fair . But at least tell me in a general way why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are too many connections between Scott 's death and everyone that knew him . " Ortega nodded .  | I hung my head , staring at my hands . " I hate this . There are people involved in this that I know from a long time ago , and from back east , and others I 've just met here . Somehow , they all know each other , and they 're all connected one way or another to my work . It 's like a maze that keeps bringing me back to the same point . I did n't want to be mixed up in this . " I stopped , afraid that Ortega might think I was whining , but when I looked up , he was listening intently , his pencil put away , his hands folded on the table in front of him . There was nothing indifferent or impersonal in the look in his eyes . Sergeant Ortega probably was n't more than eight or ten years older than I , but he had in his serene gaze the wisdom of someone who had walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many ways the paths cross near Scottie 's death , " I concluded quickly , wondering if I were making any sense at all . " Yes . Our man was at the center of everything . " " So that 's why you think it 's murder too , and not suicide ? " Ortega shook his head . " No . Most murders , they 're simpler than this . The murderer stands out like a scar , catching your notice like the pain that caused it . But this one , the pain of the killing is obscured . Everyone around it is angry , defensive , cove ering the pain . " He made a fluttering gesture with his hands , like bats chasing about in the dark , and stared blankly at the table top . " I ca n't get to this one . " The kettle screamed , and I got up to make the coffee . Ortega was being more philosophical than informative , again deflecting my question . I tried a different tack . " Okay , I thought about it a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five people who might have a motive to kill Scott , but none of their motives seem quite strong enough . Perhaps you 'd say no one has quite enough pain , or is quite angry enough to have done this . " I shuddered at the thought of Dave Smith 's coldness . " Unless we think of the people who might be doing it for sheer profit . " Ortega smiled sadly . " People seldom kill for money . More often they kill for the power they think comes with it . " " Power ? Okay , Dave Smith wants power . And Menken has power and probably does n't want to lose it . " Was Smith setting Menken up for a fall ? Perhaps . Certainly , money was the corn-  | mon denominator among all these people who were connected with the murder . Blackfeet was in business to find oil , but it takes money  --  investment capital  --  to find that oil . Without that capital and cash flow , Menken would fall from power . If Smith could grasp control of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and eliminate Fred Crick while he was at it . As financial manager , Jon Hathaway was frantic about money and probably did n't care exactly where it came from . Pete , of course , stood to gain directly through overriding royalties on all oil produced from Lost Coyote . Good old Pete . As I set the coffee to drip through the grounds into the pot on the stove , I ran down my mental list of suspects . Who else had been in the building that night ? The receptionist ? I did n't know enough about her to know how she might stand to gain from Scott 's death . Simon Bunting : had he been there ? His interest in Lost Coyote Field would be at a professional level , rather than financial , or would it ? And was the suicide of Love and Christiansen 's accountant connected to all of this ? Ortega sat quietly , saying nothing further . I did the same , hoping the weight of silence might persuade him to talk . I 'd met my part in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished dripping . I poured Ortega a cup but let it sit conspicuously on the counter . Ortega smiled at me and picked up his pencil . " I 'll just catch up on my notes , " he said . That did it . I slapped the countertop , hard , surprising even myself . " Are you going to tell me or not ? " Ortega stared at the table in front of him , his cheeks turning a deep mahogany red . " I 'm sorry . If I tell you any more , it would involve you ? " " I 'm already involved . " " You can still get out . You 're young . You 'll heal . " Heal ? I see falling bodies on the backs of my eyelids , and I 'll heal ? " Listen , Sergeant , if you wo n't let me work with you , I 'll work without you . " Ortega 's dark eyes went coal black . He leaned across the table and tapped it with one short finger . " And maybe get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this murder so well  | that no one in a building full of people saw it done . My job is not just solving murders ; I 'm supposed to keep people from getting killed . " " Fine . You 've said your piece . " Ortega squeezed his eyes shut . He balled his hands into fists and muttered something I could n't understand in Spanish . I believe he would have spat if his culture had not forbade such gestures in front of women . Opening his eyes and looking at his hands , he said , " There are things I can tell you directly , and things I can not . It 's a matter of evidence , particular things I have to keep quiet about . Then , if you or anyone else were to confess , I could say , How did you do it ? ' and you 'd say how , and then I 'd know if you did it or not by what you knew . " So we were both concealing proprietary information . At least that put us on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he offered . " Did you find a witness who saw someone leaving the parking garage that night ? " Ortega opened his eyes in surprise . " No . Why do you ask ? " " Before you got there , a couple of cops were talking about possible routes people could have taken out of the building . There was one route out of the parking garage that was n't covered , and then the question of the dock door . " " We got it covered . They both let out onto Glenarm . The doorman at the Fairmont had a good view down there the whole time . He remembers , because all the traffic started going funny on Seventeenth , and he came out to the corner to find out why . " " Oh . " That meant it was one of the people in the lobby that night . Or did it ? " Did you and your men find anyone upstairs when you searched the building ? " " Just a couple janitors , on the eighth floor . " He shook his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And Archie was the only one in the garage ? " " Yes . " " And the guy who takes the money in the parking garage was clean ? " " Okay , yes ; he 's disabled , gets around on crutches . And his  | machine records the- time of each transaction . There was n't time for him to make it to the sixteenth floor and back , even if he could walk at a normal rate . We timed it . " Then it was true : the killer was someone who 'd been standing in that lobby . I looked away , surprised to find how much I 'd hoped it was n't one of the people I worked with . Especially Pete . I sighed in exasperation . Was that the real issue here , to prove to myself that I had n't slept with a murderer ? Was I that vain ? I said , " Let me ask my question another way : why did you have to consider suicide , and not just accident and murder ? " Ortega dug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoonful went into that half cup of coffee . Two . Three . He stared into the cup and stirred , a man transfixed by a demon . " Because it is good form to consider every possibility , and because the pattern of Mr. Dinsmoore 's behavior was , as we say , consistent with suicide . " " But he was circling ads for houses to rent . " " He could have borrowed the paper from somebody else , already marked . " " He seemed so happy and serene that last day . " " Okay , yes , but gloomy and agitated just before . This is the pattern of a man chased by a thousand devils , who is despairing , and finally makes his peace . Unfortunately for such people , they only see one way to grasp their peace . Very common in suicides . " Menken 's words floated up : These people , they ca n't seem to think up a better option than killing themselves . Was he right ? " No , the whole picture does n't fit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end his life wearing something as , well , laughable as tartan pants . No , your forensics lab must have given you physical evidence that confirmed that Scott was murdered . Let me guess : you found plywood splinters in the back of his jacket , proving he was pushed . " Ortega closed his eyes and whispered , " Hijo de Dios . I will never make lieutenant . " Opening his eyes again , he said : " No , a pocketknife was used to cut through the duct tape that was holding the plywood in place over the window on the sixteenth  | floor . The plywood was neatly set aside . " He pantomimed the removal of the barrier . " You ca n't find the knife ? " " Oh , we have the knife , all right , that 's how we know a knife was used : it has the adhesive on it from the duct tape . The knife was in the deceased 's pocket . But the fingerprints on the knife were wrong . " I leaned forward , thinking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They were someone else 's fingerprints ? " " Oh , no , they were his , but the grip was wrong . " He demonstrated on his pencil . " To hold the grip right for cutting , you 'd do this . " He wrapped his fingers around the pencil in a good grip , then shifted it to an awkward , loose grip . " This would n't work at all . " He pressed down on the table top with the pencil , and it slid out of his hand . " Besides " ? and here he smiled ? " our boy 's a lefty . The prints were from his right . " He shook his head , smiling at the joke . " These foolish murderers . They always screw up . " After Sergeant Ortega left , I sat up late outlining my ideas about who might have murdered Scott , and why . For the solution to this little puzzle to make sense , I reasoned , there must be some connection to Lost Coyote Field . It follows from there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gerald Luftweiller , and from him to my old schoolmates , and from them .. . There my logic bogged down . I needed some way to sort out the pieces that fit from the extraneous ones that did n't . Think like a geologist , Em , my critical conscience said , helpful for once . Remember what your geology professor used to say ? That the simpler explanation for a complex pattern was usually the correct one ? Why not just look for the obvious stuff and add in the flourishes only if they prove to be part of the whole ? That seemed to make sense , so I went with it , outlining  | things on a piece of yellow legal paper in Bill 's study . The dog wandered in and napped on the area rug , perhaps companionably . Or perhaps , that was just his spot . I wrote : Fact : Scott dies of a fall from 16th floor window . Fact : Persons present in building at time include Here I trailed off , because the first person who popped into my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind tightened up into a knot . For the umpteenth time that day , I flailed myself with , How could you do that , Em ? In penance , I wrote PETER TUTARAITIS in letters about an inch high . Then I added several other names : Menken , Dave Smith , Crick . Moving to the right , I added a second column , entitled MOTIVE . Well , for Pete I was n't sure what to write under MOTIVE . His marriage could be part of another puzzle , not this one . I finally settled for writing " Financial interest in oil field , " and stared at that for a while , trying to figure out how it might be a motive for murder . Could Scott have known something that would hurt Pete 's interest in the field ? The production rates were high . If someone was going to monkey with them to rip someone off , it would make more sense to underreport them and sell the overage on the black market without paying royalties . And in that case , Pete would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from an overriding royalty , paid out of gross profits . And finally , if Pete were doing something illegal , it would be more to his interest if the drilling moved forward without publicity , so why kill someone and draw attention to the field ? And all of this presumed that there was indeed something nonkosher about this field . Which brought it back to my desk . What the hell was going on at Lost Coyote ? I went on to Menken , the next name on the list . His possible motivation did n't seem any clearer , but it was true that Scott had pulled a full court press on him shortly before his death . Had they really discussed a raise or promotion ? If so , did that spell blackmail ? Menken might be callous enough to commit murder , or perhaps just enough abstracted from the normal  | ebb and flow of human emotion . But I had been dismissing him as a lightweight , too involved in his manicured fingernails and real estate deals to get excited enough to kill anyone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd seen so far , Smith was driving Menken like a car , steering the committee meetings and Menken 's interaction with the police as if Menken were a half-wit . But then , there was Menken 's splitsecond evaluation of the motivation for suicide , which had been right on the money . Was he really that dim , or did he just let people think he was ? I moved along to Dave Smith , who was so anxious to keep Lost Coyote Field 's mystery a mystery that he 'd taken my work away from me . Why did I always think of him by both names , instead of as just Smith ? Menken was Menken , why was n't Smith Smith ? Was it because Smith was such a common name ? No , it 's because it 's such an opaque name . It 's like camouflage ; it disguises him as ordinary . And ' Dave " is n't any more distinctive : I need both names just to keep track of him in my mind . For Smith 's possible motives , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Morality . " I looked back at my list . Oh , yeah , Fred Crick , my phantom boss . He was a complete mystery to me . It was clear that he was in competition with Dave Smith , although their jurisdictions did n't really overlap . Crick was in charge of geology , and Smith was engineering . Was Smith trying to run Crick clear out of the company ? And if so , how ? I sighed . I was just going to have to get onto the grapevine and swing . Who else was there ? The receptionist with the open-toed shoes and the weak stomach had been present that night , glaring at me . It was hard imagining someone who could n't even keep her breakfast down committing violent murder , but I wrote " receptionist " on the list anyway . I leaned back in Bill 's swivel chair , trying to sort through this maze of inconclusive information . The squeak the chair made as it gave way on its springs awakened the dog , who looked at me indignantly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Well , I sure could n't come up with a motive for the receptionist . Who else was there ? Jon Hathaway . Irma Triff . Were  | they involved ? I wrote their names down just in case . Maddie ? No ; probably down at the Slant Hole , frying her innards with hot links . At least I was n't sharing an office with a murderess . Or was I ? The murderer had n't necessarily appeared in the lobby . Naw , Maddie left hours earlier . Inconclusive . But surely not Maddie .. . Next , I tried to list what I could eliminate as being coincidental . I wanted fervently to remove my classmates from the picture , not because I felt any great loyalty to them , but because the thought that the roots of murder might reach back to those horrible prep school days turned my stomach . I 'd spent the ten years since graduation trying to disassociate myself from these people , and now they were back with a vengeance . Vengeance , now there 's a motive .. . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind would n't rest . I lay rigid late into the night , my mind reaching into the darkness to divine where coincidence stopped and murder began . I 'll see Libby tomorrow for lunch ; maybe she 'll tell me more without Rachel there to silence her . Yes , I shall ask the princess for the boon of information , I decided , as my mind finally descended into an uneasy sleep . As the first ripples of dreamscape bent the logic of my thoughts , Libby swam past me in robes laced with silver threads , her golden hair woven rich with ribbons and precious stones . I stared up at her from the bottom of the moat below her castle , watching her elegance unfold above me , now banners uncurling in the wind above the castle walls . Tuesday began with the humble sound of Elyria 's cat hacking up hair balls on the foot of my bed . I opened one eye and stared at her . " Save it for your boyfriends , fuzz wad , " I growled , jumping out of bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | but I silenced the news , figuring I had enough to contend with in my personal corner of the world . I showered briskly , ironed a shirt , and buffed my shoes , singing a Hank Williams tune the while , a precontest ritual reminiscent of my barrel-racing days . By the time the kettle screamed on the stove I had fully armored myself in tweed , had given the dog his pill , and was pulling the raw materials for a proper breakfast out of the fridge . Em Hansen , champion investigator and peerless professional of the western world , eats a wholesome breakfast . Eschewing Pop-Tarts in favor of a more balanced menu , our heroine The phone rang . It was Elyria . " I 'll be home tonight , " she said , with a sigh . " I 'll be glad to see you , " I said , with feeling . I 'll have your horse saddled , compaiiera . We have miles to ride . I could think of no one better than Elyria to bounce ideas off of as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downtown . I said good-morning to drooling Howie and watched a blind man seated across from us read Playboy in braille as I made a mental list of people I 'd need to see that day and questions I wanted to ask . I 'd pump Maddie , and there was of course Libby , and Topsy and Rachel for that matter . And who was that who phoned Topsy to spread the news of Scott 's death ? Marcie Jacobson . I remembered her from prep school . She was n't a bad egg , but a gossip of the first water . And Simon Bunting : I 'd take another stab at finding him . I added Menken to the list : perhaps he was good for another round of cuisine de lasagne , with a what's-your-act chaser . Smith ? Save your breath . Crick ? Hard to interview a disappearing act . Hathaway ? That would be coy : you 've never even been introduced , and you 're going to drop in and casually ask him a few questions about a murder ? Tutaraitis ? Tutaraitis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slipped past my defenses . I squeezed my eyes shut , trying not to think about him , but my desire for him was not a thing of the mind alone . Maybe Libby was the one who was untruthful , and Pete had really  | thought she was n't coming back . Besides , he said he had to keep up appearances , right ? Maybe " Hurt ? " The voice came from right next to my ear . It was Howie , his ever-cheerful face soft with worry . I smiled at him and shook my head , then realized what had prompted his question : I was clutching my stomach so hard that I was bent forward . I must have looked like I was on my way to the hospital with an attack of appendicitis . Howie tipped his torso side to side , all concerned . " Yes , hurt , " I replied , admitting it to myself as well . Howie lifted a hand and patted me on the shoulder : pat , pat , pat . I almost bawled . The bus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the shuttle that ran down the Sixteenth Street Mall . After three slow blocks , impatience levitated me out of the shuttle . I slapped the buzzer , descended to the curb , and marched down the granite flagstones , outstripping the arrival of the shuttle by five minutes or more . By God , I had fire in the belly to get to work at last . One block up from Sixteenth Street and around the corner stood the Cattlemen 's Exchange Building , jutting from the earth into a cobalt-blue sky . As I approached its base , where the steel and glass sheathing gripped the sidewalk , the reflection of a red car passing in the street flashed past the corner of my eye like a splash of blood . I stopped and closed my eyes , struggling to dispel the image . I need to get more sleep , I told myself firmly . That 's all it is ; fatigue . I hesitated , summoning strength of will . I leaned my head back and searched sixteen floors above me for the one chink in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dull blip impossibly far overhead , in a mirror of the sky . The sky was so beautiful . On a clear day like this , it was the same sky which slid on over my prairie . With the comfort of this thought , I drew myself up and went inside . Then everything ground to a halt . Maddie was n't there . Crick was n't there . Menken was on an important conference call . And as I said , I was too much of a wimp to march into Dave  | Smith 's office under any circumstances , let alone on some trumped-up pretense designed to get him to talk . I sat in my office , uncertain whether to chance a trip to the coffee room . Could the engineers and geologists who congregated there smell the subtle scent of traitor over the thin chemical reek of paint and carpeting ? Probably not . Suck it up , Em , you 're getting paranoid , not to mention a touch grandiose . The assholes probably do n't even know you exist . Thanks for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frustration , I scrawled a note that said " I need to talk to you . Please contact me as soon as you return , " signed it , folded it in three , and carried it down the hall to Fred Crick 's desk . I set his coffee cup on top of it , not so much to hold it down in the event of high wind as to hide it from the view of anyone who looked into Crick 's office through the glass panel by the door . I managed to get in and out without being seen . After that , I got out the phone book and dialed the number for Love and Christiansen . A hushed and confidential-sounding voice informed me that Simon Bunting was still out , could she take a message ? " Do you know when he 'll be back ? It 's important . " " No , I do n't . I expected him back on Thursday . I believe he might be ill . " Ill ? Scott had been murdered the day before that  --  Wednes-day  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the memorial service Monday , not twenty-four hours ago . AWOL , more likely . Well , maybe if he was a close friend of Scott 's , he was just taking time off to grieve . " Do you have his home number ? " I asked . " Oh , no , I ca n't give you that , " the voice said , scandalized . " That 's strictly against policy . " " Thanks anyway . " I pressed down the button on the phone before she could ask my name again , and pawed back to the B 's in the phone book . Bunting , Bunting , Bunting . . . ' bye baby bunting , pappy 's gone a-hunting . . . I found a Simon Bunting on South Gilpin Street and dialed . If memory served , Gilpin Street was near Washington Park , right near Rachel 's house .  | A recorded message clicked on after the second ring . The voice was Scott 's . " You have reached the home of Simon Bunting and Scott Dinsmoore . No one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blah , blah , blah ... What ? They were housemates here in Denver ? Nobody told me that . Quickly , I checked the number for Dinsmoore , Scott . Same number . I was still sitting there with my mouth hanging open when the message beep attempted to shatter my eardrum . I listened to dead air for a moment , unable to figure out what to say to an answering machine . Coming from rural Wyoming rig life , I was n't exactly used to the goddamned things . The machine shut off . It was voice-actuated , and I was n't making any voice . That meant I had to dial the number and listen to the beyond-the-grave voice of Scott Dinsmoore all over again , but when the squeal came this time , I was a little more prepared . " Ah , er . . . this is Em Hansen , calling from Blackfeet Oil Company . I 'd like to talk to , ah . . . Simon Bunting . Please call me at . . . ah ... " I dug one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the phone number , threw in Elyria 's number for good measure , and hung up . After that little shock , I felt the need to get up and walk around a bit . I made a cursory attempt at checking the logs and files for Lost Coyote back out of the vault , but when I told the old mastodon with the juicy cough what I wanted , she waved her hand no between hacks and tottered back to her desk . " Damn Dave Smith , " I muttered to myself , as I headed back for the elevator . Back in my office , I drank too much coffee and spun vivid fantasies about how to get around Dave Smith . Making a mint in the stock market so I could buy the company and fire him might take too long , and a letter bomb seemed a bit coarse . I decided instead to phone Wanda McCandless , who subcontracted as a files researcher at the Wyoming State Oil and Gas Commission in Casper . It might take a few days , but Wanda could get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'd used her services once before , when I was still a mudlogger . Just then , Maddie arrived . She had on the dress with the big 162  | polka dots again , and this time had added an enormous bow in the hair to match . I did n't dare phone Wanda with Maddie in earshot . Instead , I tried to pump Maddie , but she could n't talk ; she was getting something ready for an early-afternoon committee meeting . Maybe that was the occasion for the bow in her hair . I lounged at my desk , trying to figure out how I could get a call through to Wanda . Call from Scott 's office ? Too noticeable . Leave the office and call her from a pay phone ? No , she had a beeper system , and frequently had to return the calls later , ringing through from the pay phone in the lobby of the Oil and Gas Commission . It might be a while before she could call back . It was an hour before Maddie 's bladder filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cup of coffee . She proved in fact to be the Amoco Cadiz supertanker among coffee drinkers , but at long last she got up and wandered down the hall toward the women 's room . I dove for the phone , dialed information for Wyoming , and got through to Wanda . It was nice to hear a Wyoming accent . I said , " This is Em Hansen , calling from Denver . I need some information for Lost Coyote Field . " Wanda quoted her hourly rate and charge per photocopy . She was , as I remembered , wonderfully cheap for the bounty of information she could provide . " What do you need ? " she wanted to know . " The pay sections of the logs , the production reports , basic filings , and any maps . How long will this take ? " " Well , not so long as all that . I 'd normally charge you for a rush job , but to be truthful , I do n't have anything else going on just now . I can probably even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomorrow . This is Tuesday ? You 'll have it Friday or so , maybe Saturday if you take your mail on the weekend . " " Any way to get it faster ? " " FedEx , but that would cost ten or fifteen dollars extra . " " Go for it . " " Who did you say you worked for ? " " I did n't say . I 'm , ah  --  independent . " " Well , Miss Hansen , I only offer that service to my estab-  | lished customers , because of the financial risk , " she said , trailing off suggestively . It was clear that I was sounding too fly-by-night for her tastes . " We did business once before , last April . " " Ca n't see as I remember , " she said , her voice icing up . " I 'd just have to have something in advance , and I do n't take credit cards . They charge me a percentage . " My mind went into high gear , tossing out strategies such as wiring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed logistically nightmarish . In desperation , I wailed , " I grew up in Chug-water . " Her voice thawed . " Well , why did n't you say so . I have an aunt in Horse Creek . Do you know Thelma McCandless ? " " Thelma McCandless ! I knew that name sounded familiar , " I lied heartily . " What 's your address in Denver ? " I gave her Elyria 's address on West Thirtieth , smiling . Wyoming had its own little version of the old school tie , or the old girl network , at least . " One other thing , " Wanda said . " You know , do n't you , that a lot of the records filed here have a way of disappearing ? " " Meaning ? " " Oh , those boys do like to walk in here with their attache cases and they do just forget to put the files they copy back into the cabinets and not into their attaches . There 's a lot missing for some fields . " " Accidents do happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got myself another cup of coffee and swilled it down . When the phone rang at eleven , the caffeine had me so wired that I jumped . It was Libby . In my excitement over reaching Wanda , I 'd forgotten about our lunch . " Hi , " she said . " I 've made reservations for noon at Little Pepina 's . Do you like Sicilian food ? " " Perfect . " Sure , Em ; red sauce on top of a stomach full of coffee ; just the ticket . " Listen , Pete took the Saab today . I have the Volvo , which  | does n't have a parking tag for your garage , so wait for me by the entrance to the Fairmont , okay ? I 'd pick you up in front of your building , but I 'll be coming from the art museum , and the streets are so complicated with all those one-ways . " " I 'll be there . " At five past twelve , Libby arrived in a green round-nosed Volvo , circa 1965 . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until the last lug nut spins off into the great highway in the sky . She reached over and unlocked my side , and I lowered myself into the seat , demurely doing it just as my grandmother had taught me : sit first , swivel , then bring both feet in together , rather than lurch in one leg at a time , as I automatically would have done in any other circumstances . Libby always did raise the level of the game . Little Pepina 's was across the Platte River from downtown , snuggled into a small Italian neighborhood along the west bank . Humble as the neighborhood appeared , the restaurant was quiet and genteel , with a spacious feeling and deep linen tablecloths . The waiter 's eyes went soft with devotion the instant he spotted Libby . He fawned over her , hurrying past other people 's upraised index fingers to rush her order to the kitchen , and hovering by her side to refill her water glass each time she took the tiniest sip . I wondered how she did it . Perhaps she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holographic projection on the pleasure center of the brain , I mused . I wrapped my tongue around a succulent bit of veal while Libby dawdled over her pasta e fagioli and picked at a green salad . We played Do You Remember So-and-So and So-and-SoElse for a while , but as soon as I found a favorable opening I asked her how long she had known Scott . " Since seventh grade . He was always there , sweet little Scottie with his freckles and his blushes . " She went on to tell me some tender stories about his humorless attention , standing by like the most unlikely knight attending the lady fair . " I was glad to see him again when he came out here to work . We were really very dear friends . " She stared mournfully at the tablecloth . " What 's being done to find out who killed him ? " she asked .  | I stopped with a forkful of veal halfway to my mouth . Maybe Libby had a way of being disarming , but I was n't ready for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't ruled on it yet , " I said carefully . " Why do you suppose it 's murder ? " Libby laid down her fork , placing it carefully across the right side of her plate , aligned with her knife . She closed her eyes and sat very straight and still . I was afraid she might cry . " The police do n't know Scottie , " she said , in a very small voice . " He would never kill himself . " The waiter appeared from nowhere to whisk her plate from the table , and as he bent far enough to see her expression , he cringed slightly , in anguish to find her unhappy . He shot me a look that said How dare you upset her ? I rewarded him with my best Suck pasta look . " I agree , " I said . " I do n't think he killed himself , either . " Libby opened her eyes . I had expected to see sadness , even tears in them , but what I saw instead was the light of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? It 's not right . Whoever killed him should be put away . Forever . " Perversely I asked , " Was he sad when he lost you to Pete ? " I was beginning to get like Cousin Lester again , just rubbing my nose in my own irritants . Libby looked startled . Then she collected herself , shook her head and smiled with pursed lips , indicating that I was being rather rude . " So how did you meet Pete ? " I persisted stubbornly . I suppose I was hoping to get a similar reaction , or even a direct confidence that they were splitting up . And when . " I think it was at a dance . " She shrugged her shoulders , as if the exact occasion of their first meeting had not really stayed in her memory . A little hard to believe , but then , Pete had said that she had n't loved him  --  how did he put it ? ? physically . Perhaps she was for some reason immune or oblivious to sexual heat . What a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of escarole to another position on her plate . The light from the tall windows bounced diffusely off the white tablecloth , illuminating her face like one of Fra An-  | gelico 's angels . " Pete studied geology at City College . Is n't it funny that you 're both geologists , " she said . " Why funny ? " It piqued my curiosity that she would offer the information that he had attended some school less socially elite than the Ivy League . And what kind of a geology department did City College have ? Did they run field trips via subway to study building stones of Manhattan ? " You and Pete are so different , from such opposite ends of the universe , but yet you work at the same task . He 's a city boy , you know , from New Jersey ; Newark to be exact . There 's quite a large Lithuanian community there . " Lithuanian . That explained the fantastic Baltic angles to his face . Sigh . " Of course , his mother is Polish . He 's really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Her gaze lifted from her plate and held me , her pale eyes trained on me like the twin lenses of an antique view camera about to freeze my image for posterity . My stomach began to tremble . Why was she telling me this ? Why would she choose to tell me those few particular things about Pete that anyone from her social set would normally take pains to obscure ? He had not gone to the right school . He was not from the right town . He was not of preferred lineage . I thought of saying something self-righteously defensive , but then it hit me : perhaps she knows . Perhaps this was how ladies tell other ladies that the game is not in season . I watched her from the corner of my eye as I took my last bite of veal , trying to divine from the tilt of her head if she was aware that she was looking at her rival , or if I was just being paranoid . " Has n't he done well , " I commented , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , yes , has n't he , " Libby said , as she called for the check. % On the drive back from lunch , I tried repeatedly to take control of our conversation , but Libby seemed lost in a trance . When a truck suddenly pulled out from the curb , she did n't react to swerve away , and I was grabbing for the Volvo 's wheel by the time the truck driver found his brakes .  | It was a relief to return to the office , where I could count on Maddie to notice everything larger than a dust mote and leave me with no doubt about anything that crossed her mind , however draped in Texan idiom it might be . I found her sitting at her desk with her feet up on an open drawer , eating a choco-late-nut bar and reading a fat paperback . She grinned , munching happily away . " Committee over ? " I asked . " Yessiree Bob , and I sold my prospect . " She waved her candy bar and book in the air . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . " " Do what ? Aw , it war n't nothing . I just threatened to take a bullwhip to ' em if they all did n't go along with it . Makes ' em shit their britches every time . " As I said , one always knows what 's what with Maddie . I cleared my throat . " Maddie , " I began , launching straight into what was on my mind , " you seem to have a handle on what makes the world turn here at Blackfeet . Tell me more about the power struggles . Where 's your money , on Dave Smith or Fred Crick ? " " Smith , damn his viperous eyes . " " Why so ? " " Well , something 's got to give , is all . This kennel 's shrinking just like everybody else 's , what with the recession and the oil slump and all , so 's they got too many alpha pooches hanging about . " " You mean management 's top-heavy . " I was getting pretty good at translating from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , someone 's going to get his balls chomped off any minute , and I 'll bet it 's Crick as winds up the soprano . Poor fucker has n't got the moves . A good geologist , but no kind of politician . " " So you think Smith is going to cull him from- the herd ? " " Like I said . " " Well , what if there was something funny about one of the oil fields ? Who would stand to lose ? " Maddie looked up with a nasty **33;91;TOOLONG glint in her eyes . " Smith , if you 're talking about Lost Coyote . "  | The twangy cadence and jargon to her voice had suddenly dis-appeared . " How do you figure ? " I asked , likewise lowering my voice . Maddie put down her book and came over to lean on my desk so she could whisper . " Hell , I do n't know , " she said , studiously consuming another mouthful of chocolate . " Crick 's been fighting development of that field right along , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new wells can be properly tested . Why ? You find something out ' at 's going to embarrass someone ? " " Maybe . " Maddie smacked her lips thoughtfully over the candy and straightened up . " I do n't know , Em . This ai n't my cup of tea . I tell ya , those boys play kind of rough . " She raised her eyes overhead , then dropped them rapidly to the floor , letting out a long whistle that culminated in a splattering sound . Maddie left early . The walls of my office took on a menace , as if the hostility I felt all around was pressing them slowly toward me . I wanted out of that building . I became unavoidably aware of the distance my soft , fragile body hung above the street , saved from fatal descent only by the temporary cooperation of man-made materials . I decided to pay a call on Rachel Conant . I knew Rachel worked for the governor , but there was n't any listing in the phone book for " Rachel at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out which of the numbers listed under the state pages in the government section applied . I decided to take a walk over to the capitol and see what I could see . The capitol was only a few blocks away . On the way , I was panhandled once and informed of the sexual fantasies of total strangers twice . When a guy with a three-days ' growth of beard sidled up to me as I waited for a Walk light at Colfax Avenue , I almost slugged him ; as it turned out , he was merely lost , some rangy student looking for the art museum . I mutely pointed across the Civic Center and crossed against traffic , not slacken-  | ing my pace again until I was climbing the wide stone steps that lead to the main entrance of the Capitol Building . The Capitol Building is a classical sweep of grey stone surmounted by a guilded dome . It has all the features that impress a child on a school visit : echoing rotunda , immense raked chambers for the houses of government , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifteen minutes of searching directory boards and asking around , I was shown through a labyrinth of offices and anterooms into a room that must have been on the other side of the wall from where I 'd started . It was pretty nice . It had a high ceiling and monumental amounts of fine wood paneling . Rachel sat behind a heavy mahogany desk . I had caught her off guard , her lap full of halfsorted correspondence . She stared at me with her customary frankness . " Hi , " I said . " Hi , " she said quietly . " Urn , I just wanted to pay you a visit . " I pointed toward Seventeenth Street . " I just work over there a few blocks . I was kind of taking a break , and ? " " Could you lower your voice , please ? The governor 's right through that door . " She pointed toward an innermost chamber . " Oh . " Some glint of shrewd curiosity lit Rachel 's eyes . She held up a finger . " Hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take a break . " Bowing her head back over the letters , she pointed at a chair for me to sit on . An older woman in one of those suits that never goes out of style because it was never in stalked into the room on heels so spindly that I wondered if her Achilles tendon might be permanently shortened . She chirped , " Rachel , dear , what 's left on the docket for today ? " Rachel glanced at a page on her desk . " Police awards at three-thirty , Cub Scout Pack Twenty-three at three thirty-five , Save the Planet Week at three-forty , then that bicycle race promotion at three forty-five . Looks like we 'll be done early today . Can you handle these without me , Louise ? I have a visitor . " She gestured toward me . " Em Hansen , from school . "  | Louise shined a well-oiled smile on me . " How nice to meet you , Miss Hansen . Certainly , Rachel . " A tall young man in a suit came in and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The boys in blue are here , ladies , " he said , in a nasal tone . " Heads up . " A dozen or more policemen shuffled quietly in , their hats in their hands , their hair slicked down , and their shoes polished to a high gloss . Louise extended one arm toward the inner chamber door . " Just wait here until the signal . " Rachel put down a letter and pushed a button on her desk . After a moment , the inner chamber door was opened from inside by another young man , revealing a much larger wood-paneled room with a much larger desk , behind which sat a man with an even larger smile occupying the lower half of his face . He was dwarfed by the enormous flags that hung beside his desk ; a Colorado tricolor on one side , and a drape of stars and stripes on the other . The policemen shuffled meekly into the governor 's office and the door swung shut . The outer door swung open again , and a group of cub scouts trooped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear blue eyes registering nothing more than the rapture of the moment . Rachel put the last of the letters down and rose to her feet . " Come on , " she whispered , " before one of these little monsters puts a finger up his nose . " I followed her out into the rotunda . We crossed the echoing stone floor and climbed into a slow-moving elevator that labored asthmatically skyward and put us out several levels up near a doorway that opened to a balcony overlooking the Civic Center . Rachel walked directly over to the thick stone railing and leaned on it . " God , I hate the Boy Scouts , " she said . " I think they were cub scouts , " I offered . " Cub scouts , boy scouts , they 're all the same . " " I take it this job bores you . " Rachel rubbed her sinuses with one hand . " To tears , " she said . " What was that bit with the groups ? Is it Meet the Governor Day , or something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They run them  | through like that at five-minute intervals most afternoons . One benevolent society after another , all getting their picture taken with The Man for politics and glory . They queue them up like that , staging them through the outer office , then my office , then into the governor 's chamber , then out a door that flushes them right back into the rotunda . The adults are okay ; they 're all so cowed that they 're going to meet someone important that they do n't say much . Just stand there and jitter ; I 've gotten used to it . But the kids , they 're awful . You ca n't get a kid to hold still for five minutes like that , and by the time they get into my office , they 've already been on a bus for who knows how long and then caged up in the outer office . They 're animals . They get into everything . And today I have such cramps . " This was a view of Rachel I 'd never seen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that all the advantages landed in her lap . It never occurred to me that she knew a moment 's discomfort , let alone enduring menstrual cramps and ricocheting cub scouts while trying to pick through someone else 's mail . " I 'm sorry to have interrupted . " " I welcome the interruption . " Rachel ? Welcome me ? I 'd come here to pry information from a hostile subject , and now that subject was turning the tables , making it a social event . That would n't do . Being treated with kindness by Libby made my job hard enough ; what if I found out Rachel was a human being , too ? I looked out over the murk of Denver 's atmosphere toward the mountains , trying to get my bearings . I felt like someone waking from a coma after ten years of oblivion , trying to grasp all at once how much the world had changed . I was definitely going to have to rethink a few things . And yet , something in my internal gyroscopes kept telling me I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to come from outside ; I remember hearing it . Was it only coming from inside now ? I felt moved to make a gesture , to do my part in closing the gap between us . I said , " Do you want some aspirin ? " I started to rummage through my purse , although I knew there was nothing in there but a tube of lip balm , a key to Elyria 's house , and  | my wallet . I would n't have even owned the purse if my grandmother had n't bought it to go with the suit . " No , I 'm half gone on Motrin already . " She looked at me out of the corner of her eye , the set of her lips finally betraying distrust . " So what did you want , anyway ? " Good question . What was I going to ask her ? Listen up , Rachel , I 'm investigating the murder of Scott Dinsmoore , and you 're on my list ? Fat chance . That would win a terse command to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Worse yet , if she were somehow involved in his death , we were too damned close to a very long drop . I looked back over my shoulder to gauge my exit , should I need to make it a quick one . " I 'm trying to find out more about Scott , " I said bluntly . " The police keep hanging around . It 's got me wondering , so I thought I 'd ask . " Rachel 's eyes turned opaque . " Ask what ? " Another good question . " Well , you know . . . , " I said , buying time . Rachel sighed with exasperation . " I hear you had lunch with Libby today . Is that what 's on your mind ? " I said , " Kind of . " Sure , let 's see where that takes us . " Well , I do n't know , she seemed to be in kind of a weird mood . Distracted , kind of . " A weak little part of my brain wanted to ask , Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid the answer might be yes . Rachel was no dummy ; knowing her orientation on the universe , it would take no hints at all for her to guess how I 'd spent Saturday night . Rachel 's eyes suddenly turned to ice . " I 'm not in the mood , Em . Come to the point . " This was n't going well . What was so offensive about my questions ? " I did n't know I was hitting a sore point . " " This is n't a sore point , " Rachel said , her eyes narrowing further . She turned abruptly and started past me to the exit , her body stiff with repressed emotion . I followed her into the echoing upper story of the rotunda , keeping well away from the railing . " I 'm sorry , Rachel , I was just trying to understand . I mean , my God , what are you all doing out here ? It just seems so strange that you 'd all wind up in the  | same town . " I followed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nerve had I struck ? Rachel studied me in calculating appraisal , then smiled dryly . As the car descended toward the main floor , she spoke in a formal tone , as if to a total stranger , perhaps a reporter from the society page of the Rocky Mountain News ; so polite and formal that there had to be some irony imbedded in it : " My husband and I came first , two years after college . He has a good job , the transfer was a promotion , and the skiing is better here than in the East . My father got me this job . It 's boring , but I really ca n't complain , and it helps us have money for extras . Topsy found her way out here a year or so later . Libby and her husband " ? her voice faltered for some reason over this reference to Pete ? " came out two years ago . Libby does not like it here . She visits her family back east regularly . Scott came out about two years ago , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gerald probably followed Scott , knowing him , or perhaps it was Simon he had in mind . What else would you like to know ? " I returned Rachel 's calculating look , no longer bothering to pretend this was an idle social visit , and silently vowed to turn this particular wildcat over to the talents of Sergeant Ortega and Lieutenant Flint . I knew that overpolite tone of voice she was using : it meant I was out , wasting my time . As I trudged slowly down the steps that descended the slope in front of the Capitol Building , I wondered how many times at school I 'd heard that kind of recitation . It was the fine art of hiding a deadly secret behind a pretty veneer of truth . Elyria met me at the door as I stumbled in from the bus stop that evening . " I see that you 're in deep with this murder investi-gation , " she said . " How did you know ? " " You 're walking straighter , for one . And you left notes all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And Carlos called to say he will be here in fifteen minutes to take us out to Chubby 's and debrief you . " " Carlos ? " " Sergeant Ortega to you , no doubt . He 's serious about his professionalism , or at least as he defines it . " Somehow the obvious fact that Sergeant Ortega had a first name startled me . I liked the private , mannerly little world we had been constructing , and I did n't want it to change . " Yes , " I said doubtfully , " Sergeant Ortega to me . " I went into my bedroom and skinned out of my suit . As I hung it up , I smoothed it carefully , making sure it would n't crease as it hung against the other clothes in the closet . There was something stuck to the seat of the skirt . I looked closer . It was a thick hair , about four inches long . " Elyria , " I called . " Come look at this . " I was wiggling into my jeans as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look more normal to me now . Is that what I was supposed to see ? " " No . " I picked the hair up off the top of the dresser , where I had carefully laid it . " This . Does it look familiar ? " " It looks like a red hair . " She was definitely in a droll mood . " But what kind of a red hair ? " " This is a game , right ? Where do I start ? Animal , vegetable , mineral ? " " Animal . It 's important . " Elyria sobered up and scrutinized the hair , holding it up to the light . " It looks like it came from an Irish setter . " " It came off the seat of my skirt . " She studied me , waiting for me to fill her in on the significance of this earth-shattering bit of information , but before I could speak , the doorbell sounded . Elyria hurried toward the door , carrying the hair . I heard her open the bolt . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurried to tuck in my shirt , " do come in . Em was just teasing me with dog hairs . " There was a pause , and then Ortega 's voice , triumphant : " You see ? I tell her we 've got dog hairs in the victim 's car , and she finds me another . Em ! Where did you get this ? "  | I hurried out into the living room , expecting to be greeted by Ortega 's jubilant smile , focused on me and me only . Wrong . He was smiling at Elyria , basking in her lovely presence as one might take in the Pieti  --  humbly , peacefully , engrossed in spiritual experience . He glanced at me and winked . On the way to dinner , I gave him an innocuous sampling of my day ; about the source of the dog hair , and my chat with Rachel . I did n't tell him that I had ordered the well logs from Casper . That was my department . " Okay , this is really good , " Ortega @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'll see what Flint and I can do with this Simon guy , and you can leave Miss Conant to us . What 's her voice like ? " " Her voice ? " " Is it high-pitched ? Like a little girl ? " " No , I 'd say an alto . Why ? " Ortega did n't answer . I thought about this , as we wound through the brick neighborhood toward Federal Boulevard . Ortega asked his questions casually , as if he were just making small talk . I had promised myself that the next time I heard that tone in his voice , I 'd pin him to the wall , and find out what essential bit of information he was hiding in plain sight . " Why ? " I repeated . Ortega 's face lit up , but he did n't say anything . Elyria took in his expression and said , " I know this grin , Em . Whatever it is , you 'll never get it out of him now . " " Maybe he just wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ortega blushed , but grinned even wider and said , " We 'll send the dog hair to the lab , see if it matches the ones we found in Mr. Dinsmoore 's vehicle . " " And that 's another one , " I said , starting to smile in spite of my attempts to display exasperation . " You did n't tell me Scott was roommates with Simon Bunting . " Ortega beamed at me in approval . " I did n't know it mattered , until now . His office kept telling us he was out of town . We thought it was very interesting that we could n't find this Mr. Bunting , but we 'll look harder now . " As Ortega drove , I took in the sights of northwest Denver  | old commercial buildings and a mixture of two-story Victorian houses and one-story bungalows . He turned right on Thirtyeighth and headed downhill toward one of the viaducts that spanned the railroad yards and the Platte River Valley . The neighborhood grew darker and poorer . At Lipan Street , he dodged in behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " All out for Chubby 's , home of the best burrito in Denver , " he said , leading the way around to the front of the building . I heard the squeal of tires before I saw the car . It was an old Chevy , chopped and riding low to the pavement . The driver had swerved , and was accelerating straight toward Sergeant Ortega . Ortega threw himself away from us , selflessly using his body as a decoy . I saw his round eyes widen , and as time telescoped , he seemed to drift away from us as if floating on a river of air . The Chevy bounced against the curb with a horrific clashing of metal . I heard the driver shout : " Chingaso ! You hurt my car , man ! Next time I kill you ! " With a hand held high in insult from the driver 's side window , the Chevy careened up Thirtyeighth Street and disappeared over the rise . As Ortega regained his footing and brushed himself off , I saw Elyria 's eyes flare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , teeth bared , " he could have hurt someone . " Ortega blushed deeply at Elyria 's language , a rich rose-red beneath his brown skin . I tried to recover my wits . " That man threatened to kill you ! " I said , trying to steady my voice . Ortega shook his head with frustration . " Hipolito 's a problem " was all he 'd say . I looked pleadingly at Elyria . What kind of a place was this I had come to live in ? " Welcome to the barrio , " she said haughtily . " Home of great burritos and even greater machismo . " " Just a little occupational hazard , " Ortega said . " They get offended when they think you break away from the culture . Something about my job . I do n't know . " Elyria stormed ahead into Chubby 's and slammed the door .  | Ortega watched her go , smiling in admiration . " She says we have tempers , " he said , a chuckle arising from his belly . Chubby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall with a small order window and two minute Formica tables . Ortega leaned through the window and ordered , joking in his musical Spanish with the cook and a teenaged girl who was delivering fresh tortillas from the factory up the street . When we got our burritos , we sat in the car , savoring their fragrant , spicy fillings . I felt something strange in my chest , perhaps just my heart growing larger . It was a relief to sit in a plain sedan having a simple dinner with two people who were treating me with uncomplicated regard . I realized that for the first time since leaving Wyoming , I was happy ; not excited and overwhelmed , as I had been with Pete , but quietly and comfortably happy . The feeling lasted until we had returned to Elyria 's and had a cup of hot chocolate , which Sergeant Ortega cooked up on Elyria 's stove from a stash of Mexican Imbaburra he kept in his car . Before he left , he turned to me . " We ca n't find Archie Arch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the street person you hauled out of the parking garage the night of the murder . " " Right . " " He was on the sidewalk yesterday morning after the memorial service , too , was n't he ? " " Right . You seen him since then ? " " No . Why do you ask ? " Ortega shrugged . Here we go again . I prepared myself to pry information out of Ortega . Or barring that , to get as many stray clues as I could from him . " Is he homeless ? " " Okay , you could say Archie is homeless , because he does n't have a home . But Archie is different : he does n't want a home . " I found this hard to imagine . In Denver , temperatures get down to twenty below most winters , and the mercury drops close to freezing even during summer nights . " How does he survive ? I mean , why would anyone choose to live on the streets ? "  | " Oh , Archie 's different . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an artist ? " " A poet . He performs on the street . Performance art , I think they call it . " Ortega smiled at some inside joke and shook his head . " He told me once that having a regular home would upset his creative process . ' On the street , he gets inspired . We wanted to talk to him after the memorial service , but he , urn ? went away before we could get through that crowd . " " You think he knows something ? " Ortega smiled his Who , me ? smile . " I have to wonder why he came to the service . " " How could I find him if you and the whole Denver Police Department ca n't ? " Ortega 's smile grew very broad as he rose to go . " You have your ways , Em . I know this about you . Besides , the last place we know he 's been staying was the parking garage in your building . We found him in level B , sleeping on an I-beam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ortega to the door . " I 'll get it , " I said , scheming to leave him alone with her for a moment . " Maybe that 's Frank , " Elyria said . " I forgot to tell you . He called just before you got home . He 'd like you to call him , Em . He 's worried . " I ran back to the kitchen . The thought of speaking with Frank brought mixed feelings of relief and guilt . Well , I can tell him I at least wrote him a letter , I reasoned . Maybe that would make it okay that I have n't called . But when I picked it up and spoke to it , I did n't find Frank 's voice on the other end of the line . It was Pete . " Emily , " he crooned through the earpiece . " How are you ? " I was n't at all sure . What was I supposed to say to him ?  | " Emily ? Well , hey , I 'm heading out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store over on Gaylord , about five blocks east of Washington Park ; I was wondering if you wanted to join me . " " Well ... " " I thought we could talk . " Yes , I wanted to tell him a few things , but the thought of meeting clandestinely now filled me with shame . " No , " I said , " I ca n't . Ca n't make it , sorry . " " Hey , lady . Is there something wrong ? " I stared into the mouthpiece of the telephone . " Emily ? " He sounded worried . My heart had turned into a hundred-pound weight . " Well , maybe next time , " he said , sounding hurt . He said good-bye and hung up . I stood holding the phone for a while , mouth gaping , then hung it up and walked numbly into the living room . Elyria and Sergeant Ortega were still talking on the front stoop . " Who was it ? " she asked . " Pete Tutaraitis , " I answered , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Just wanted to know if I could help him walk his dog . " " His dog ? " said Sergeant Ortega . " Where was he going ? " " Some ice cream shop on Gaylord , " I mumbled . I looked at the floor in confusion . He nodded and politely took his leave . " Okay , out with it , " Elyria demanded , after she closed the door behind him . " You look like your best friend just died . " I could n't tell her . There was no way to explain . Elyria 's eyes grew dark . " Let me guess , " she said quietly . " Pete seduced you . " I started to cry ; big , burning tears of humiliation . " No , it 's worse than that ! I seduced him ! " Elyria came and put an arm around me . " Listen here , friend . It 's not so bad . " " Yes it is . I let myself believe  --  but he 's married . And to Libby Hopkins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here I 've gone and slept with her husband . " The tears coursed from my eyes , and my lips began to swell as blood rushed to my face . In a  | moment , my nose would run . How I hated to cry when anyone could see me . " I was such a stupid shit ! " Elyria steered me to the couch and sat me down . " Shh , shh . Now really , Em , was he honest with you ? Did he tell you he was married ? " " Yes . He said she 'd left him . He said he wanted to wait . " " Em , dear , do n't be so damned hard on yourself . He broke a vow , not you . And I do know he 's a handsome man , who is well acquainted with the effect he has on women . In retrospect , you made a mistake . But you 've learned from it , eh ? " " Yes . " I was n't convinced . " Of course you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chin up . " I could n't look Elyria in the eye . There were things I had n't told her . Like that Pete was the man I 'd always dreamed of , back in those long , sad days in prep school , and that the dream was not yet dead . Perhaps a more grievous omission , I had n't told her that Pete might have stolen critical data from Lost Coyote Field . And that his response had seemed insincere , even giddy , when the police told him that a close colleague had just suffered a violent death . And that he was right now walking a dog that I would bet any money had long , red hair , identical to the hair unaccountably found in a car that belonged to that dead colleague , who for some reason hated Pete . If you ever hear me claim to be a wise woman , fully in control of her faculties , lock me up . I thanked Elyria for her sympathy and told her I was going for a drive to calm down . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she handed me the keys to Bill 's truck . I never could hide a damned thing from her . I pulled the truck over by the unlit sidewalk a half block short of the ice cream shop , suddenly uncertain what I was going to say when I saw Pete . Now that I was here , I hesitated , unready to climb out of the shadows that filled the cab of the truck . I decided to wait outside and talk to him in private .  | A dog was chained to a signpost at the curb , waiting in the bright light that spilled from the shop 's windows . His long , russet Irish setter hair fell in elegant waves down his back . Five minutes passed . Pete stepped out of the store , licking a long plastic spoon . Pausing in the door frame , he lowered the spoon into the tall cup he held in the other hand , retrieving another dollop of chocolate . It disappeared slowly between his lips . I sank back against my seat , trying to collect my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parked two lengths in front of me opened , and a woman stepped out . I was immediately glad I 'd waited : Rachel 's aristocratic stride was unmistakably familiar . She strode around the back of her car and stopped in the shadows at the edge of the sidewalk , a slim , square-shouldered figure in wool jacket and corduroy slacks . Pete turned toward her and smiled . It was n't a hey-hi-there smile , or an **26;126;TOOLONG , but a slow , sensual ahhhh . His spine and pelvis moving with the slow rhythms of a cat , Pete strolled toward her , and as he advanced , Rachel receded from him , drawing him down the sidewalk toward my truck . I oozed into the heaviest shadow in the cab of the truck and held my breath , my jaws clamped tightly . I cursed the fact that the side window of the truck was open , fearful that they might hear my breath . I did n't even dare slide the rest of the way down below the dashboard of the truck , for fear I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort not to be seen , I closed my eyes . I heard Pete 's warm voice . " Rachel , " he purred . " Thanks for coming . " The truck let out a ping as its sheet metal began to cool . My eyes snapped open . I tensed , fearful that they would turn and see me in the shadows . They were so close to me that even in the darkness I could see the soft curve of Rachel 's throat against the crisp open collar of her shirt . " Listen , Pete , " she hissed , " George will be home soon . This is n't the time . " Pete moved on her , backing her up against the truck . " Rachel , my sweet , you seem agitated . Whatever could be the problem ? " Rachel leaned back against the fender of the truck and arched her neck , tipping her head away from him . Her voice  | was low and thick with anger . " Cut it out , Pete . We have business to look after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was deep , sassing : " What business ? " " The police have n't closed the book on Scottie yet . You said they 'd call it suicide and that would be an end to it . Well , they have n't , and now Em Hansen 's coming around asking her stupid little questions . You have to watch out for her , Pete ; she 's not the ignorant little hick she appears . " Pete pressed his hips against hers . The truck trembled with the movement . He ran his spoon between his lips again , as if to absorb every last molecule of sweetness , then turned it toward Rachel , waving it close in front of her eyes . " What 's your worry , little Rachel ? " he teased . " You think I ca n't handle her ? " " Stop it . " With a barely audible growl , he lowered the spoon down between the starched wings of her collar , probing deeper and deeper . Rachel moaned softly , whispered , " Please , Pete , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You know I ca n't stay with Libby without you , " he murmured . He pulled the spoon out of her blouse . He kissed her neck , set the cup on the hood of the truck . His arms slid around her . She whispered , " Things are different now , and you know it . " The truck swayed . I slid the rest of the way down onto the seat . I no longer feared that they would notice me . I wanted only to become tiny , and fly away . An engine coughed into activity behind me . It whined and caught , and headlights suddenly erased the night . The motion at the front of my truck stopped . I heard Pete laugh . The car that had started pulled away from the curb and rolled past the truck . A horn sounded briefly , and then a familiar voice joined the night sounds of Denver . " Is that your dog , Mr. Tutaraitis ? " said Sergeant Ortega . Rachel 's steps receded quickly down the sidewalk . She opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and  | squealed away from the curb . The next I heard Pete 's voice , it was near the dog : " Yes , Detective , he 's mine . " " Get in , I 'll give you a ride . " " That 's okay , I can walk . " Ortega 's tone became firmer . " Do me the honor , sir . " I heard the door on the right side of the sergeant 's car open and close before the sound of its engine melted into the night . I lay on my back on the seat , tears painting my cheeks with warmth , uncertain which was more painful : the loss of hope , or the sweetness of knowing that a man named Ortega held me in such regard that he would blow a stakeout to spare my feelings . Wednesday morning , long before the alarm went off , I was jolted from twisting dreams by the telephone . Elyria appeared at my doorway , eyes almost closed with sleep . " It 's for you . Would n't say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I moved along the walls to the phone in the kitchen , groping in the predawn darkness . Fumbling with the mouthpiece , I croaked , " Hello ? " A baby-doll woman 's voice came onto the line , childish and high . " Is this Em Hansen ? " " Yeah . Who 's this ? " " You called for Simon . What did you want ? " " Who is this ? " I demanded . Whoever she was , she was someone with access to Simon 's answering machine , someone perhaps who could come and go from his house at will . The voice took on a nasty edge . " A friend . " It was a phony voice , as if a woman with a normal voice was speaking in a falsetto . " Do n't give me that shit . Anybody gets me out of bed at this hour is no friend of mine . " " Simon knows why Scottie died . " " And why 's that ? "  | Silence . I waited . I was waking up fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I figured that if I did n't say anything , someone twisted enough to phone in the middle of the night might get nervous or impatient enough to just spit it out , instead of playing games . The line went dead . Dial tone . " Who was it ? " Elyria asked , now swathed in a silk dressing gown and slippers . I sat down on a kitchen chair and pulled my knees up under my flannel nightgown , feeling like a little girl . " A real sick-o , jerking my chain about Scott . Should I call the sergeant ? " " Let him sleep . " " What time is it ? " " I do n't know . We had a power outage during the night . " The digital clock on the microwave oven was flashing " RESET . " She disappeared for a moment and reappeared with a wristwatch . " Four fifty-three . Lovely manners your caller has . " " Right . I 'm wide awake now . " Too many years on drill rigs , having to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emergency . Only I never learned the skill that 's supposed to go with it , the one where you go back to sleep on a moment 's notice , too . Elyria yawned , running a hand through her glossy hair . How I longed to be more like her ; graceful and lovely even when completely disheveled . Some bit of early-morning wisdom wandered into my head : You get to be like whomever you 'd like . Elyria smiled and said , " Let 's go out to breakfast . " By five-thirty , I was showered , dressed , and ready to leave . Elyria was still in the shower , luxuriating in steam and hot water , singing a Bulgarian love song her mother taught her . Its eerily beautiful minor keys and microtones reverberated off the bathroom tile and laced through the house . I sat in the darkness of the living room , unable to avoid thinking about the clandestine meeting I had witnessed the night before . Slightly delirious with lost sleep , my mind alternated between fond delusions that I had dreamt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shop , and a self-hating  | certainty that it had been quite real . The implications of the meeting were inescapable . Aside from the unwelcome knowledge that they were ( a ) intimate , and ( b ) given to discussing me as some hick bloodhound who asked stupid questions , Rachel and Pete were deeply involved with Scott 's death . My job was getting uglier by the minute . I itched for something to do , some action to take . It was too early to phone anyone here in Denver . But aha ! It was after eight on the East Coast . I picked up the phone and called Virginia Information , in hopes of a number for Marcie Jacobson , the classmate who had known of Scott 's death almost as soon as I had . No luck . I did n't even know what town she lived in . With some misgivings , I phoned my grandmother to see if she had a lead on Marcie . Her housekeeper answered , and got the old barracuda on the line . My grandmother 's voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good morning , Emily . To what do I owe the honor of this call ? " Unlestroi deceive myself , she was truly pleased to hear from me . I 'm not heartless . I made small talk for a while , even told her how many compliments I was getting on the clothes she had bought me . I let her steer the conversation for a while . " Have you been getting together with your classmates ? " she asked . " Yes , Grandmother . " " How lovely . You know how pleased I am . " Inspiration struck . " Yes , but I 'm worried about them , Grandmother . This business of Scott Dinsmoore dying . Everyone 's terribly upset . " " How sad , dear . " I weighed my next words carefully . I knew that anything I said would hit the Brahmin broadcast system , so I had to decide what news I wanted out there . " Yes , it 's shocking . The police ? " " Police ! " my grandmother cried . " This does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the police : a fate worse than taxes . Grannie had n't heard . This meant that the old girl network was saving face : Scott 's family was imposing a news blackout , horrified at implications of which they had to be aware . " Gram-  | mie , " I said , unconsciously using my childhood pet name for her , " can you help ? Please understand , I know the police detectives personally . One lives right here in my neighborhood , " I added , knowing that my grandmother would conjure the image of a gentleman police detective living in a fine neighborhood before she would imagine her granddaughter living on the edge of the barrio . For good measure , I threw in , " They 're friends of mine and Elyria 's . You 'd like Elyria so much . " That should cover the confidentiality problem , I thought . Personal alliances buy generations-long group silences in New England . I began to feel bad at how thoroughly I was misleading the old dame ; for once , I did n't feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I repeated , not lying . " Certainly , dear . You know you may rely on me . " " Thank you . " " Now , Emily , just what is going on there ? " In the end , I told her only that there was some uncertainty about how Scott died , and  --  here I led her astray again , maybe  --  that it was of utmost importance to me to prove that my old friends from school had no connection whatsoever to the " situation , " as I called it . I never did get around to asking her for Marcie Jacobson 's whereabouts . It was n't necessary . I knew that by lunchtime , my grandmother would have her entire generation canvassed , and would be starting on the next . Breakfast was sausage and eggs , a comforting old favorite , but daylight was a greater tonic , diluting my sense of humiliation and loss with the ordinary details of life . As my mind focused more fully , new directions of inquiry opened within it . I headed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day of reconnaissance in the glass-and-steel jungle . I looked down at my hands where they lay , so soft and vulnerable , in my lap . I imagined my fine tweeds soaked in blood , my grand-mother 's horror at my demise , her hope that the family genes would be passed to yet one more generation shattered . I need more sleep , I told myself , as I shambled to my feet and gingerly  | descended from the shuttle at Welton Street . My imagination 's running away with me . In the twelfth-floor lobby , the receptionist flared her delicate nostrils at the sight of me . Irma Triff lowered her mascara-heavy eyelashes in clear contempt . And to add continuing insult to this injury , Pete looked past me as if I were a stranger as he strolled by me in the hall with his hands in his grey flannel pockets . I huddled at my desk , warming my hands around my coffee cup , wishing Maddie would appear . I glanced at my watch . Eight exactly . It was only because I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That was it , I was just tired  --  no , exhausted . An engineer  --  what was her name : Angie ? ? walked past in the hallway , staring in at me as if I were some ugly , contemptible bottom-feeding fish in a public aquarium . I cast an eye about my desk top for something to train my attention on . Thanks to Dave Smith , there was nothing there . With hands that were beginning to tremble , I pulled open a drawer on my desk to get out a pad of paper , then yanked open the lap drawer in search of a pen . I was greeted by a piece of white paper , folded in three , addressed in my own handwriting . It was the note I had left on Fred Crick 's desk . The eggs and sausage I had consumed with such pleasure started to rise from my stomach . I forced my breathing deep into my abdomen and counted to ten . When I was certain my stomach had stabilized , I picked up two pens and used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note , all right : " I need to talk to you . Please contact me as soon as you return . " But something had been added . One line of type  --  Courier 12 , just like nineteen out of twenty office electronic typewriters : " Good girls mind their own business . " I picked up the phone and made an inside call . After two rings , the receptionist picked up the line . " Yes ? " Her voice was brisk , icy .  | " Is Fred Crick back from Tulsa yet ? " " No . " I waited . When no further sound came over the line , I placed the receiver back in its cradle . I closed my eyes . " Stomach cancer ? " I jumped at the sound of Maddie 's voice , and realized that I 'd been clutching my stomach . Maddie looked genuinely concerned . I said , " It 's nothing , " before I even thought , and tried to push the drawer closed . Maddie was too fast for me . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The note was still open . " What 's this ? " Before I could stop her , she flipped the note over , and saw to whom it was addressed . " Uh-oh , so that 's what 's going on . You got your tit in the wringer now , sister . " " Says who ! " Maddie shook her head at me , a long , leisurely message that I was n't fooling any babe from Texas . " It 's on the wind in the coffee room . I heard those jackals yammering about your inappropriate behavior as I came down the hall just now . From the sound of it , I thought you 'd gone to bed with Menken , or something . But this is worse . I take it you left Freddie a little note , and someone short-stopped it . " " Who ? " Maddie looked at me like I was nuts . " Who knows ? We 're not talking about a spat you have going with some bully at the school yard . Whoever did this knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you said they were talking about it ? " " I said they were talking about you . They probably do n't know about your note . From the looks of it , whoever put this here started a little whispering campaign against you to make sure no one 'd talk to you . " " Then who ? " " Take your pick . Keep in mind that these folks are trained observers , who make their living analyzing the data that get set ; before them . They just look like morons . It ai n't escaped their notice that you got your little puppy fangs sunk into a bone they hold dear . "  | I squinted at her . " But do you at least have an idea who did this , Maddie ? " Maddie glanced at the doorway . No one was there . In a whisper , she said , " Smith . The jerk 's been sending his goons out bad-mouthing you . " Without waiting for a reply , she moved quickly to her desk , picked up her eraser , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ descended to the street and *ft the building , stretching my legs out into long , fast strides , hurrying to get as far from the building as I could . I moved over to the mall and beat out a tattoo on the granite pavers , threading my way through meandering pairs of midday shoppers with baby strollers and white-collar workers who promenaded aimlessly , sunning themselves in the midday glare . By the time I reached Larimer Street , I felt better , and as I slowed my pace on the Fifteenth Street viaduct , Dave Smith had shrunk in my mind from a monster to the more manageable size of a petty bully who had to rely on whispering campaigns and other cheap forms of intimidation . I stopped and leaned on the bridge rail , staring into the murky waters of the Platte . Protruding from the thin flow I saw broken bricks , a mutilated shopping cart , somebody 's shoe . Farther down its course , an old man walked his pit bull along an elegant , winding path , some civic leader 's bid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stale air that hung in the valley and started back toward Blackfeet , my feet moving much more slowly . At Larimer , I headed northeast back to Sixteenth , and at Lawrence , I pumped up my courage for Seventeenth Street . A block or so down Seventeenth , I spotted Maddie . She was moving casually along the sidewalk in her fuchsia dress , her black curls bouncing and shining in the sun , her muscular hips swaying with the pleasure of her stride . She carried her shoulders proudly , her neck as straight as any queen 's . Heads swiveled with interest as she passed . I lengthened my own stride to catch up with her . I was about in hailing distance when the damnedest thing happened .  | Around the corner came a troupe of what ? Dancers , I guess . They were dancing , at least ; sort of shuffling along in a stamping rhythm , shaking rattles and beating skin drums . It was a bit hard to focus my attention on that detail , you see , because these , ah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that their skins were completely covered . Let me start over . Around the corner came half a dozen men clothed in loincloths and mud , with large earthen pots covering their heads . Some were fat and some were skinny , and they were completely brown from their necks to their bare toes , as if they were spawned of the same clay that formed their jug heads . These heads were mute and imposing , ornamented only with vacuous dark holes in the eye positions , small semicircular slots by their ears , and tubular spouts for mouths . They wore necklaces and anklets of crude beads , and feathers strung on gut . Best yet , their leader wore a fedora atop his jug , and marched along in the tight-assed swagger of an eighteenthcentury fop , carrying an attache case , an umbrella , and a rolled-up newspaper . Maddie stopped perhaps fifteen feet from the dancers , grin-ning . The lead mud man 's troubadours gathered around him . He set down his attache . He opened the paper . He read , howling through his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wah , wah , wah ! Angry Woman Bites Dog ! Beauty Queen Transvestite Hog ! Middle East Detests the West , whaddawegonna DO ? " " RAH ! " shouted the mud man chorus , taking a short hop toward the crowd . Men in tailored suits stepped back nervously , forcing smiles to show that they had n't really been startled . Women stared . Maddie grinned and puffed out her chest , holding her ground . The mud man with the fedora turned the page and read on : " Woo , woo , woo , woo ! Cancer Caused by Carrot Sticks ! White House Sale on Dirty Tricks ! Hollywood Is Turning Tricks ! Haddiwegetso SCREWED ? " " HAH ! " shouted the chorus , charging into the crowd , which immediately scattered .  | Except for Maddie . Maddie stepped right toward the chief , swung a hand around in a wide arc that ended with a loud smack on the chief 's left buttock . The chief dropped his paper and pranced with delight , then stopped and wrestled open his attache @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maddie 's hand . She clutched his offering to her ample bosom and stood on tiptoes to kiss him on the jug . He shimmied in ecstasy , then aimed his mouth tube at her ear and whispered something , tipped his hat to an older woman who seemed frozen to the sidewalk in catatonic shock , and strolled out of sight back around the corner . Maddie resumed her progress down the sidewalk as if it were all in an afternoon 's stroll . " Friend of yours ? " I shouted , jogging to catch up . She looked over her shoulder and smiled . " Old Archie ? Shit , yes ; he 's a pistol . Do n't make ' em like that back in Texas . " Archie . Of course . Street performer . Poetry . That had been Archie Arch under all that mud . I spun around . No sign of Archie or any of his henchmen ; the whole scene might not ever have happened . I sprinted back to the corner , but Archie had once again melted into the stone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where I left her . " Ain'ch y'all never seen a mud man before ? " she drawled , savoring the juiciness of her chewing gum . " You know Archie ? " I asked , trying to sound cool . I was so close ! " Sure . Do n't everybody ? " We started walking again . " I mean , know him personally . " " Well , I ai n't certain anybody knows Archie personal like . He 's a little unusual , as you might have noticed . Why you so inter-ested ? " she asked , cocking her head to one side . There was no toying with Maddie McNutt . I tried to divert her with another question , kind of like diverting the Mississippi with a spatula . " What did he give you back there , anyway ? " Maddie opened her hand , revealing a square plastic packet  | with an unmistakable circular shape bumping up inside it . " SAFE SEX , " it said , in crudely applied ink . He 'd given her a condom . " Guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said , breaking into a maniacal cackle . " Ai n't he a pistol . So thoughtful . " She trained her canny eyes on me . " But y'all were about to explain your interest in the man , now were n't you ? " " Me ? " I looked all about . " Hey , I just do n't see that kind of stuff every day . Why , back in Chugwater ? " Maddie tipped her head back and laughed . " Y'all ' bout as subtle as a pig with wings . What is this , some more of this detective work I hai n't noticed ? Y'all Em ace superstar go-it-alone do n't need no help off no-body Hansen ? Your prollem , honey bun , is y'all 's got ta figger out who yer friends is . " I sighed . " I want to meet Archie , " I muttered . " Well why did n't y'all say so ? " she shouted . " Just stick with me , slick . I 'm meeting his ass later on , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " A block short of Blackfeet , Maddie suddenly remembered an errand she had to run . I could n't blame her if she did n't want to be seen walking into the building with me . Her absence left me walking into the belly of that building solo , without a buddy to watch my back . My neck and shoulders tightened into a cramp , and my feet grew strangely heavy . Keep moving . This is silly . I pushed open the heavy doors , pressed myself into the cool air of the street-level lobby . See ? So far , so good . Two husky overgrown bully-boy engineers from Blackfeet hurried past me , the sound of their heavy footfalls swallowed by the carpeting . I slowed my stride , hoping I would n't be noticed . They reached the elevator and pressed the button to call the car , then turned and watched me , their mouths moving with  | words they kept too quiet for me to hear . As the elevator doors opened , one of them braced them with his hand to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chivalry of his gesture . No way . I was n't getting on that car . I cut to the left , heading into the staircase . Inside , I sucked concrete-flavored air in great lungfuls , gripping the handrail . Come on , Em . You got what , three hours sleep ? You skipped lunch . You 're getting paranoid . Where do you get the idea anyone around here even gives a shit what you know ? That overgrown sandlot hero probably got stiffed by his girlfriend at lunch or something . You think every-thing 's about you ? I sat down on the cold step and hung my head , trying to control a deep , slow trembling that had invaded my bones , but no amount of self-scolding could control it . I needed rest . I needed a place to exist , to be welcome , to not be Other . Twenty minutes later , I was still sitting there . My nerves had quieted , but it was occurring to me by degrees that I was going to have to leave the staircase eventually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleeping on a girder in the parking garage . I stood up , my legs aching with fatigue . Taking a deep breath , I pushed open the fire door and stepped back out into the lobby . No one was there . I approached the elevator call buttons , disgusted at my cowardice . What did I think was waiting for me up there , a last cigarette and a firing squad ? You 're as mad as Archie . As I stood there screwing up the courage to walk back into the fray , the red down light dinged on over the doors , and the sheaves slid open . An elderly businessman was standing inside , holding the doors open for me with one arthritic hand . " Going down ? " he rasped . " Why not ? " I got onto the dreaded elevator and journeyed downward with him . He got off at basement level A. I stayed on to the bottom , to basement level B. The elevator door hissed open , letting in stale air . As I stepped out of the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neck . It was a crawly feeling , as if someone , or perhaps some-  | thing , was watching me . Psst , hey Em , the sensation said . Over here . For a moment , I considered heading back upstairs , but the car had already left again , and here , at least , no one was staring at me like I was the lowest form of life . It did n't take long to figure out where Archie had been hiding , or living if you prefer . The only I-beam I could find that was exposed was not far from the elevator bank . It formed a lintel over the steel fire door that opened onto the inner staircase . On first glance , there was no sign of Archie 's habitation , so I pushed at the fire door to see if he had left any clues in the stairwell . The door swung open stiffly at first , but then swung loose all at once and banged against a hip-level steel post that jutted out of the floor to one side of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside when it was opened from the inside . Smudged concrete walls greeted me on the other side of the door . Back out in the garage , I tried to figure out how Archie had gotten up onto the I-beam . I could barely reach the bottom fin of the beam at full stretch , and I did n't remember Archie as a very tall man . After a few minutes ' study , I saw how he had done it . I hitched up my skirt . Reaching again for the bottom of the beam with my hands , I put one foot up on the steel doorstop and lurched upward . Once balanced on the top of the post , I could get my other foot on the doorknob , and pull myself up to a good view of the accommodations on top of the beam . It formed a shelf about two feet deep and maybe six feet long , with excess head space of a spare twelve inches . Not the Brown Palace exactly , but definitely out of the weather , and guaranteed to please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the alcove were verses , metered out in a squirrelly little hand in blurry felt-tip pen . I strained my eyes in the gloom , but could n't quite read what the odd little man had written . My feet started to ache from the pressure of their precarious points of balance . My calf muscles trembled . In a moment , my feet would slip ; it was either up or down , and no amount of squinting was going to bring those words any closer . Pulling  | with all my strength , I hauled myself up on the lintel , scrambling to catch traction on the cold , dirty steel . A button on my jacket caught on the edge of the beam , nearly pitching me off into an awkward fall , but as my skirt worked its way up my thigh , I finally gained enough skin-to-steel friction to haul myself onto the beam . I rolled onto my back , and pushed my skirt back down toward my knees . The concrete above my face was cloyingly close . In that claustrophobic space , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight and crush me , but as I lay there , I suddenly experienced a feeling that Archie must have felt , as he lay there through the long night hours , wrapped in darkness . Privacy . Absolute unmolested removal from all that was going on around me . As my eyes adjusted to the shadow , I could just make out a verse directly above my face : The ardent monk of darkness dwells Within a steel and concrete hell To earn his keep he watches while The goblins dance in city style With life and death the same to them His penance lasts at others whim . Not much for punctuation , but it evoked an image . I contemplated it a while , savoring the strange perspective it evoked . Farther down toward my stomach , I found something a little lighter : jungle cat same as that likes to chat wears no hat drives drives runs along mating song A work in progress ? There was another that was probably a tone poem , as it just seemed a string of nonsense words that sounded nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rehearsal for the Mud Man Stomp I 'd heard at noon . That was pretty much it , other than a few groups of four vertical scratches crossed by a fifth , as if he 'd been counting the days in a prison cell . At least the guy had a sense of humor . I was just surveying possible routes back down when I heard someone coming down the staircase . I pressed myself farther into the shadow , certain that this was no place to be discovered . If I have to , I can lead with my feet , and kick like hell . The door swung open . Once again , when I was least ready to deal with him , it was Pete . I forced my lungs to take very shallow , quiet breaths so he would n't hear me . He crossed the space between the door and the first line of parked cars . Halfway across that short distance , he stopped , tensing as if at an unexpected sound . Had he sensed my presence ? I held my breath and did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the shadow and see me . Unsatisfied , he turned slowly , peering left and right , but mercifully he did not think to look near the ceiling . Still frowning , he fished his car keys out of one pocket and moved between the cars . He moved quickly to the old green Volvo and unlocked the door , and curved his indecently handsome body into the seat . As I looked down on the Volvo , the crawly feeling that had plagued me since I first entered the garage returned , intensified . What is it ? I asked , myself , as the Volvo 's engine fired . The car rolled backward out of the space and stopped . Pete rolled down the window and looked around the garage . Once again , he did n't see me . I closed my eyes , listening to the rhythmic sounds of the Volvo as Pete pulled away and wound it up through its gears , gunning the car up the concrete ramp toward the street . " He 's not worth it , " I whispered . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " My mind interrupted . There 's something really important here , it insisted . Pay attention . I breathed deeply and fought to slow my pulse , so that the knowledge could rise to the surface . What was  | trying to get through to me ? Had Archie watched Pete from this ledge ? No , Archie had been flushed from the garage before Pete drove me home . Perhaps some other evening , Archie had watched . I lay a while longer on the beam , bathed in foul air and the echoes of Archie 's strange existence , trying to peer through time and space . How interesting , to lie cocooned in the taproot of this building . I felt like an insect about to hatch , confused and vulnerable after painful metamorphosis . I wondered idly if my insect 's brain was really large enough to deal with what was happening . At length , I decided I was losing my mind . I managed to get down off the beam without ripping my clothes , but they were destined for the cleaner 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ran all down my jacket , and I found that the skirt was a different color than it had been an hour before . I took the jacket off and brushed it , shaking my head at little Em who still could n't keep herself clean . Never fear , Mother , you need not scold me anymore . I 've taken over the job . I whacked at my skirt next , carefully using the back of my hand , and then dusted my shoes with my cuff . After straightening my skirt and making a rudimentary attempt at tucking in my blouse , I turned and headed through the fire door , resolving to hike the fourteen stories up to my office in penance . As the door closed behind me , I turned and peeked through the small pane of wire-reinforced glass that was set in the door , trying once again to dispel the uneasy sense that something was watching me . With a twinge , I realized that Pete had felt it , too ; that it had n't necessarily been me he had sensed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unwelcome intimacy of shared experience , a primal us united against the unseen foe . I leaned my forehead against the cool glass . It was a perfect view back toward the parking space where the Volvo had been parked . " Fuck you , Pete , " I muttered . And then my eyes came to rest on a faint bit of scrawling just below the glass . It was Archie 's handwriting again , but this time carefully inscribed in pencil , so as to be almost invisible . It was not his own verse , though , but part of an old nursery rhyme . What it said was : " Ashes , Ashes , All Fall Down . "  | It was a long trudge up fourteen flights of stairs . With every step , my resolve strengthened . I was going to crack this case . I was going to find out which of Archie 's " goblins " had pushed Scott from that window . And I was going to free more than one " monk " from a steel-and-concrete hell , damn it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the twelfth floor , I turned immediately toward the women 's room . There I cleaned myself up as best I could . Then I skulked to Menken 's office , waiting for him to return from what proved to be a very long lunch . It was time to hold the old boy 's feet to the fire , find out what he really knew about Lost Coyote Field . Irma Triff was soon sick of me . " He 's a very busy man , " she growled . " I 'll let him know you want to see him , but the likelihood that he can fit you in this afternoon is nil . " Maddie overheard this last , as she strolled by on her way in from the elevator . I could hear her whistling " The Yellow Rose of Texas " as she gyrated down the hallway , and when I followed her into our office a half minute later , she was just hanging up the phone . She grinned at me , a kind of **29;154;TOOLONG provocation number . I wondered what she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting around working off a little angst shooting rubber bands at each other when our phone rang . Maddie picked it up . " McNutt , " she drawled into the mouthpiece . " Un-huh , un-huh . " She even drawled her uh-huh 's . Putting down the receiver , she turned to me . " Menken 's back , but he 's got company  --  someone who came off the elevator with him . Simca says give him ten minutes and charge . " " Simca ? " " The receptionist . She 's got a name , baby cakes . Y'all seemed to want to visit with Menken , so I told her to call me when his nibs dragged his butt back from wherever . Old Irma can be a mite unhelpful , when she 's a mind to . " " Thanks . "  | " Think nothing of it . " I clocked ten minutes and started down the hall . As I closed the distance , Irma drew a bead on me from her lair by her mas-ter 's door . I looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in nonverbal communication : ? Yes , I 'm coming to your desk . ? Oh , you are , are you ? ? Yes , and you 're going to ring through to your boss . ? Oh , I am , am P. ? Yes , you are ; and yes , he will see me . Irma visibly braced herself against my advance . She was just arranging her mouth for the formality of asking me what I wanted when Menken 's door swung open and Simon Bunting backed out into the hall . I could n't see his face , but his wide shoulders and turret-shaped head were now engraved in my memory , unmistakable from any angle . He closed the door with deliberate care . I swerved toward Simon , changing plans . I could corner him . Easy pickings . And what in hell 's name is Scott 's ex-roommate doing in Menken 's office , if he is n't showing up in his own ? Reading my intent like a billboard , Irma yanked her phone off its cradle and punched a button @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Menken , " she croaked , her eyes betraying ever so subtle a shine of anxiety . Simon turned around . The expression on his dull face was an unself-conscious mixture of disgust and pleasure , as if he were showing off a painful rash on his private parts and enjoying the horror it stimulated in others . I tried to lengthen my stride , but the cut of my skirt was too narrow . Irma quickly recradled the phone . " Mr. Menken will see you now , " she barked . Simon glanced at me . No interest ; to him , I was just another face in the multitude . I wanted to leap at him . Simon moved across the reception area toward the elevator with the peculiar speed of the long-legged . Discarding any attempt to look casual about what I was doing , I hiked up one side of my skirt for an all-out dash . I had narrowed the distance  | between us to less than ten feet when Menken 's door opened . " Why Emily ! Come in ! " Menken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elevator door opened and swallowed Simon . As I looked back toward Menken 's door , my eyes swept past the receptionist , Simca , who recoiled from me as if I were threatening her with a handful of shit . Why ? My train of thought careened down a sidetrack , squealing , Jesus , lady , what 's biting you ? Irma 's already arid face tightened further , as if to repress a smile . Avoiding her gaze , I turned on one high heel , lost my balance on its unfamiliar foundation , and stumbled . Catching myself just short of a full-length fall , I followed Menken into his office . What had started out as a storming of the Bastille had degenerated into the ragtag shuffle of the prisoner of war . " Emily , sit down , sit down ! " he said , in a slightly diminished variant of his usual good cheer . I sat , preparing my questions . Oblivious to my silence , Menken chatted along with his usual garrulous drivel , yammering about a Wall Street Journal article he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of the big windows that looked out over Seventeenth Street , his hands clasped behind his back and his eyes on the carpet . Stopping abruptly , he stared down at the street , rocking back and forth on his heels . As he ran low on pearls of wisdom , he turned to me . " So , Emily : how are you liking Blackfeet , now that you 've been here a while ? " " Uh , fine , sir . " I thought , What just happened in here ? If he squeezes his buttocks any tighter together , they 'll squeak . " Lovely fall weather we 're having , " he said . " I like the autumn best of any season , here in Colorado . " He 's talking about the weather ? This is serious . " Back in Connecticut , where I grew up , autumn was a longer season , full of different colors , but here , it 's short and brisk . Colorado really comes to the point , do n't you think ? " I searched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the point ?  | " Certainly , sir . " Yes , come to the point . Why was Simon here ? Get a grip , Em ; you 're in here to hold this mutant 's feet to the fire , not exchange pleasantries . I cleared my throat , trying to think up some catchy phrase or manipulative question to get him to talk about what he and Simon had just discussed . Menken stopped rocking , but continued to stare out the window , his eyes glazed with preoccupation . Just as I decided he must have gone into catatonic shock , he said , " Please do n't call me sir . ' " His tone surprised me : it was soft , and rather sad . " Okay , ah , Mr. Menken . " He turned toward me and smiled weakly . " Please call me J.C . What a day it 's been , Emily . " " A day , sir ? I mean , ah J.C. ? " The name caught on my tongue like dry cracker crumbs . He shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something like , " Why did you come to see me ? " " A day , J.C. ? " I asked again , more forcibly this time . " Yes . What do you make of a woman who sounds like a little girl who calls me up in the middle of the night to tell me she knows why one of my employees has died ? " I felt like the room had just been jerked sideways a foot . Menken had heard from the baby-doll voice too , the mystery midnight caller who was so intent on stirring the pot . I opened my mouth to make some reply , but Menken threw me another curve . He said : " Emily , let 's go for a drive . " I said , " Let me get my coat , " and hurried down the hall . If Menken wanted to drop bombs like that one and pretend he was just being chatty , that was fine . Hey , he can spill his guts in semaphores , if he wants . He wants to go for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive . He 's the boss . Back in our office , Maddie was just starting to straighten her desk up for the night . " Small change of plans , " I said . " Duty calls . When and where are you meeting Archie ? " Maddie cocked an eyebrow at me . " Duty , huh ? " " Yeah , duty . So where can I find you ? " " I 'm having dinner at the Slant Hole with Billy Bob and Bubba , a couple of those cretinous stereotypes from Texas y'all hear about . Join us there any time until around eight . " Maddie  | smiled slyly . " I 'll leave from there to meet Archie , " she added , not answering my question . I squinched up my face . " Jus ' love that Texas barbecue , " I drawled . " Put hair on your chest , " she sang , as I hurried out the door . Halfway down the hall , I dodged into Scott 's empty office to phwe Elyria . She was n't home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying that I was going driving with Menken to find out what Simon Bunting had been doing in his office , and to watch out for a low-flying grey Mercedes . Menken was waiting by Irma Trill 's desk with his attache case in hand , giving her a few final instructions for the day . " Ah , there you are , " he said . " Time 's a-wasting . We do n't want to get stuck in rush hour traffic . " We strode toward the lobby . I locked eyes with the receptionist as I passed her desk , perversely documenting the increments by which she was indicating that she despised me . This time , her expression was almost unreadable , but the air around her perfect coif fairly crackled with repressed emotion . I glared at her , squaring my shoulders in challenge : Yes , I 'm leaving with Menken , Simca . Stuff that up your grapevine , why do n't you ? Menken 's toy , my ass : this is surveillance , and you all are in a peck of trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summons . I tapped my foot impatiently , praying that it would arrive before any of my dear colleagues saw us , or worse , joined us for the ride down . I might be tough enough to stare down the receptionist , but now put to the test , I did n't want to deal with any more crap from the engineers and geologists . When I heard the muted ding and saw the light go on over the elevator doors , I realized that I had n't been breathing . The doors opened . Menken and I stepped into the car . I started a lunge for the Close Door button , but Menken blocked me . " No , no , my dear , let me get it , " he said , as he slowly picked out the button for the main level of the parking garage . I clenched my teeth . Come on , two seconds , one .. . Maddie rounded the corner from the hallway and whooped . Menken smiled and caught the doors just as they started to  | close . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a lovely lady from the Lone Star State . " Maddie 's eyes widened and began to dance as she saw me with the boss . Worse yet , she took so much time wriggling into her coat as she crossed the lobby that another geologist came into view , and then an accountant , and then Pete . Pete . If I 'd clamped my teeth together any tighter , my molars would have cracked . Everyone loaded onto the elevator car , assuming the position ; hands folded in front , eyes forward . Maddie leaned back against the back wall of the car , humming a tune . Pete positioned himself right next to me and looked to the front of the car . I stared at my feet , waiting miserably for everyone to call out their floors to the accountant , who was now closest to the buttons . Maddie 's tune bounced around inside my head like a drunken bumblebee . It was strangely familiar , out of context yet right on the edge of memory . I concentrated on it , the better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Maddie 's tune came into register . Of course it had been hard to place : it was Gilbert and Sullivan with a Texas drawl . But which operetta ? When the refrain circled by for the second time , I placed it : Ruddigore , or the Witch 's Curse , act two , the ghost scene : " For duty , duty must be done , this rule applies to everyone .... " " Maddie , " I said , " I did n't know you were so cultured . " She grinned . " Honey pie , I 'm as cultured as a pearl . " The car stopped at the Seventeenth Street level . " Knockers up , toots , " she added with a stage wink , and strolled out into the lobby . I burst into a graceless fit of laughter . Pete stepped out of the car . He stopped just outside the car and hesitated , staring at me , his face completely blank . Still grinning uncontrollably , I reached across Menken and punched the Close Door button . Pete stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As the door closed between us , I had for that one shining moment the plea-  | sure of knowing just how the Cheshire cat must have felt as he disappeared , leaving nothing behind but his grin . Menken 's big grey Mercedes rolled out of the parking structuronto Welton Street . I glanced at him . His mind was anywhere but on his driving . I wondered if I was going to have to grab the steering wheel , as I had with Libby . " Where to ? " I asked , trying to sound casual . Menken 's lips crimped into a smug smile . " There 's a little something I want to show you . " " What kind of something ? " " Now Emily , you must restrain that curiosity of yours . " " How many guesses do I get ? " As the car paused for a few seconds at the traffic light at Colfax Avenue , I wondered if I might be better served to get out . I gripped the door handle , trying to decide . Maybe this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ortega . Except he would n't necessarily tell me what he found out . Menken looked at me abstractly , as an entomologist might study an interesting species . He shook his head . " Really , Emily , I thought you were more adventuresome than this . I 'm just taking you to see a horse . It 's a wonderful quarter horse , a chestnut mare . I was pleased to acquire such a fine ? " Was I just his next round of applause ? I exhaled slowly , wondering if this trip was going to be a waste of time . I interrupted Menken 's self-congratulatory dissertation with a hopeful conversation opener : " Say , who was that guy in your office before I came in ? " " Let 's not talk about the office , " he said , abruptly . " After a long day , I like to relax . " I glanced at the clock on the dash . It was almost five . I had to be back by eight . Seeing Archie was certainly important . As Menken blathered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mercedes was traveling , in case my boss forgot which planet he was on and I needed to find my own way home . We flowed south with one-way traffic on Broadway , and then turned west on Eighth , spinning around Denver
