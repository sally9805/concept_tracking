AS THE PRESIDENTIAL-CAMPAIGN BATTLEGROUND SHIFTS TO Washington , Tom Daschle seems an odd candidate for the role he is about to play as President Clinton 's first line of defense on Capitol Hill . A slight and boyish-looking man of 48 , he had never managed a major bill before becoming Senate Democratic leader last year . Almost incapable of eye-to-eye engagement with the television camera , he prefers to read his speeches , softly and deliberately , from behind a pair of glasses . " He looks like a choirboy , " sighs veteran South Carolina Democrat Fritz Hollings , a fire breather . <P> But to the surprise of his allies and his foes , the South Dakota Democrat has proved remarkably skillful at marshaling his outnumbered Senate forces into an almost insurmountable obstacle to the G.O.P. agenda . One by one , they have buried almost every item in the Contract with America . And where the G.O.P. has managed to get critical bills passed in the Senate  --  on welfare reform , for instance  --  the Democrats have generally reshaped them , sanding off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many Republicans . <P> In his early , often rocky months as minority leader , Daschle 's most delicate task was to distance Senate Democrats from Clinton and what the Senator 's own advisers called an " aura of failure surrounding the Democratic Party . " Now he faces an almost opposite challenge . " I have to be certain that the Senate floor does n't become the presidential-campaign megaphone for Bob Dole , and to a certain extent , we can do that by keeping the Republican majority in check , " Daschle says . " I also have to be sure that any legislation out of the Senate has as much a Democratic stamp as a Republican one , so the President can claim as much credit as Bob Dole . " <P> So far it seems to be working . Last week , under pressure from Daschle 's troops , Senate Republicans dismayed their counterparts in the House when they added $2.7 billion for education demanded by Clinton to a spending bill that would keep the government operating for the rest of the year . In scoring these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one that Dole put to good use in the past  --  the filibuster . With enough party discipline , it makes the minority leader unstoppable . Whereas House Democrats have regularly fractured , Senate Democrats have yet to lose the seven defectors it would take to break a Daschle-backed filibuster . <P> When Daschle was elected to the job by a one-vote margin 15 months ago , virtually every Senate Democrat of stature lined up against him . The barons who lost their chairmanships in the wake of the 1994 Democratic rout quietly recruited Connecticut 's Chris Dodd to run against him , arguing that someone with Daschle 's inexperience would be no match for Gingrich 's gale-force approach to legislating or Dole 's awesome mastery of the game .
