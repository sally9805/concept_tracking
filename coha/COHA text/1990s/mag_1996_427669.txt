Section : Focus on Money The market shrugged him off , but Alan Greenspan was right : stocks need to cool off sooner than later  --  by Allan Sloan <p> ONCE AGAIN , FOR THE umpteenth time this year , we have to talk about the stock market . If you own stocks and have any common sense at all , you wonder about whether to get out before the market crashes . Yes , stocks roared back Friday from what at first looked like a death dive , caused by Federal Reserve Board chairman Alan Greenspan 's attempt to jawbone the market into moderation . But that should make you more worried , not less . Why ? Because if prices do n't fall soon , you can bet Greenspan will try again , when prices might be even higher . And maybe this time he 'll succeed . <p> But maybe you 're a glutton for punishment . Or perhaps you 've missed all the risky fun of the 1995-96 bull market , as many people have , and you 're wondering whether it 's too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brimming with the usual questions . Will the Dow Jones industrial average soar like an eagle to 7000 , or will it sink like a submarine to 4500 ? Is the play in big blue chips or little " small cap " stocks ? There 's no shortage of " experts " who , having failed to predict today 's market , are eager to tell you what will happen tomorrow . But remember : no one knows which way the market will move . Do n't believe anyone who claims to know . <p> All that said , let 's talk a bit about Alan Greenspan , who , with the November elections safely past , finally decided to say a little louder what he 's long been thinking . To wit : the market has gotten out of hand . There he was last month , quietly trying to talk the market down by discreetly letting it be known ( via the Nov. 25 issue of The Wall Street Journal ) that the Fed was worried about stock prices ' becoming a sort of financial " bubble " that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept rising . So on Thursday Greenspan dropped his bombshell into an otherwise boring speech at a black-tie dinner in Washington . " But how do we know , " he asked , " when irrational exuberance has unduly escalated asset values , which then become subject to unexpected and prolonged contractions , as they have in Japan , over the past decade ? " Translated from snorifying Fedspeak , that means : " Stock prices are too high . " <p> It woke up his dinner listeners , all right  --  not to mention foreign stock markets . " It was startling , " said speech attendee Herbert Stein , former economic adviser to the late President Nixon , " a clear warning . " U.S. financial markets had closed hours before the speech , of course , but Tokyo was just opening . The shock waves hit there like a tsunami . The Nikkei 225 , Japan 's version of the Dow , promptly posted its biggest one-day loss of the year , shedding about 3 percent of its total worth . Hong Kong opened an hour later . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ west with the sun . In London , stocks lost 4 percent in early trading , recouping half later in the day . Bourses in Germany and France were also hammered , and then it was New York 's turn . The Dow dropped at the opening bell , losing some 145 points ( about 2.3 percent ) before beginning a long , slow climb to close down by only 55 . It gave lots of people the willies , including me . And Greenspan helped to calm jangled nerves only slightly , when he appeared Friday afternoon to give a speech in Philadelphia . . . and declined to say anything about the market . <p> Pricking pimples : There 's method to Greenspan 's seeming madness . It 's clear that Greenspan wants to talk the market down without raising interest rates or doing anything to upset the economy , which may be weakening . " He wants to prick the pimple before it becomes a boil , " said Fed watcher David Jones , chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston &; Co. in New York . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worried that will limit his freedom to act if the economy weakens next year and he wants to lower interest rates . " In other words , to avoid a bigger crash later on , Greenspan would prefer a little " soft " one now . <p> He 's probably right , too . We have plenty of reasons to be cautious with our money these days . There 's euphoria in the air . Lots of people have bought the idea that stocks will always , always , always out- perform other investments . Smart people who should know better talk as if the business cycle has been repealed . Among investors , a pernicious myth has arisen that something called " indexing " is a foolproof way to play the market . Ahhh , would that these things were true . <p> Yes , stocks have historically produced better returns over the long haul than other investments : 10.8 percent a year , compounded since 1926 , according to Ibbotson Associates , compared with 5.7 percent for corporate bonds and 3.7 percent for Treasury bills . But the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stomachs always strong enough to survive the lurching ups and downs of the long run . Remember the 1973-74 market crash , when prices fell more than 40 percent ? If you bought at 1973 highs , it took you almost 10 years to recover . And those who gutted it out had to endure a period in which many " experts " opined that the stock market was dead . <p> Today we ca n't imagine the market as being any less frisky than a newborn bull . Shares have been buoyed by tons of money flowing into mutual funds . Much of this cash  --  no one knows how much  --  comes from those 401(k) retirement funds that 20 million to 30 million of us now call nest eggs . According to Access Research , we have three times as many 401(k)ers as we had 10 years ago , and their accounts hold a staggering $800 billion or so . Only about half that money is in stocks  --  but 75 percent of all current contributions are going into them . <p> We 'll advise you about investing for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now let 's explore why we should worry about stock prices ' being so high . The answer is easy : because reality always reasserts itself . If stock or real-estate prices get way above the value of underlying assets , they sooner or later come down to earth with a thud . Take Japan , which Greenspan invoked . It was supposed to be a New Age market , immune to a fall . Right . Japanese regulators pricked the " bubble economy " in 1989 ; Japanese stock prices are now more than 40 percent ( in yen ) below that year 's high , and Tokyo land prices are down about 75 percent . That 's the very thing Greenspan wants to avoid . <p> Now let 's get down to brass tacks . What bothers a lot of us skeptic types is precisely one of the things driving this market  --  a crazy idea that you can buy stocks without regard for what they cost . As practiced by people who are buying stocks as commodities , this approach , called " indexing , " lets you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " fundamentals . " Who cares about profits and cash flow and dividends at a few carefully chosen companies when you can own a piece of everything ? Who cares what it costs ? Just buy a piece of everything ; it will do fine . Even I 'm indexing , through NEWSWEEK 's 401(k) plan . <p> Market mirrors : Let me explain a bit more how this works  --  and outline some of the dangers . In the stock market , indexing does n't mean making out three-by-five cards and filing them in order . Rather , it means putting your money into investments , such as mutual funds , that mirror a market index , or maybe even a whole market . The prime example : the Standard &; Poor 's 500 , the best broad-market measure . <p> Take the Vanguard Index Trust-500 Portfolio , the nation 's second largest public stock fund , with $30 billion in assets . Unlike the No. 1 fund , Fidelity Magellan , Vanguard 500 does n't pick specific stocks . It just buys all 500 stocks in the S &P; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this year , according to Vanguard . You can see why . Through Nov. 30 , say the number crunchers at Morningstar Inc. , a fund-analysis company , the Vanguard 500 outperformed more than 80 percent of all stock funds . For the five years ended Nov. 30 , it outperformed more than 70 percent of them . Funds like this one are doing so well this year that many managers are said to be loading up on big , rapidly rising stocks like IBM , Intel and Microsoft , just to catch up to the indexers . This has driven up those stocks even more . <p> The best thing about indexing instead of stock picking is simple : costs . The average stock fund spends about 2 percent of its assets a year on management fees , brokerage commissions and such . The Vanguard 500 fund , by contrast , spends only three tenths of 1 percent of assets on such things . That 1.7 percent annual advantage mounts up over time . What 's more , indexing is easier on your nerves than chasing the financial fad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard work of trying to pick your own stocks . If you heeded all the advice dispensed through newspapers , magazines , TV , radio and the Internet , you 'd go out of your mind . <p> So what 's my problem ? That when everyone starts doing something , it does n't work as well as it used to . S &P; guesstimates that $500 billion of the S &P; 500 's $5.6 trillion worth of stocks is in index investments . That does n't necessarily mean the indexing tail is wagging the market dog . But having 9 percent of 500 big companies ' stock owned by folks who buy it without regard to price means , purely and simply , that shares have been bid higher they would have been otherwise . <p> OK , so what should you do with your money ? Sorry , that 's up to you . As for me , I worry about Greenspan 's warning  --  and the market 's seeming shrug . Better the market should fall from its current level than from , say , 8000 next year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem , about the proposal to let Uncle Sam put our Social Security money into stocks . This is n't about ideology ; it 's about governments buying high and selling low . <p> Maybe today I 'll sell everything , but I doubt it . I 'm only 52 , with endless years until I retire , and I 've got a strong stomach . The day before Thanksgiving I plunked a big piece of the retirement money I recently received from a previous employer into stock funds . There it will stay , doubtless signaling a market peak .
