Section : SPECIAL REPORT : mind/body If someone in your family tried to commit suicide , you may be up to six times as likely to try it yourself . A new look at a frighteningly male phenomenon <p> TO MOST WHO knew him , J. Anthony Lukas had it all . A celebrated journalist , he 'd won the Triple Crown of the literary world  --  the Pulitzer Prize , the National Book Award , and the National Book Critics Circle Award  --  for his 1985 book about race , Common Ground . He had a new book coming out in the fall of 1997 , too : Big Trouble , an account of a class war in Idaho . Yet one day , with almost-assured success ahead of him , Lukas wrapped a cord around his neck and strangled himself . Some obituaries casually mentioned an irony : Years before , his mother had also died by her own hand . <p> This death echoes uneasily for Eric Haseltine . The successful 46-year-old is now a senior vice president of a major entertainment conglomerate in Los @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a depressive cycle , Haseltine 's mother downed a lethal cocktail of sleeping pills and alcohol , placed a plastic bag over her head , and went to sleep . And as Haseltine wrestles with his own periodic depressions , he has been left to ponder exactly what it is that keeps him from following in her footsteps . <p> PARENTS WHO KILL themselves . Offspring who choose the same path . The roads of life are strewn with these casualties , and a disproportionate number are men . In recent years , science has pointed to a genetic link for other maladies , such as depression and alcoholism . Might some people be wired for suicide ? <p> If so , then men must beware : According to the National Institute of Mental Health , suicide afflicts more than four times as many men as women every year , claiming upward of 24,000 men 's lives . And suicide is an option that , for men , climbs only more steeply with age . By age 25 , men are six times as liable to take their own lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 13 times more likely to kill themselves . <p> We can probably chalk up some of these grim facts to the strange , bottled-up emotional life of the American male . In dozens of requests to suicide survivors and family members , only four people who 've endured a suicide in the family would speak for attribution  --  an indication of how off-limits the subject remains . Yet the men who are afraid to talk about a family history of suicide are the men most at risk . <p> " We know pretty conclusively that there 's a familial or genetic propensity toward suicide , " says John Mann , M.D. , a professor of psychiatry and chief of the department of neuroscience at the New York State Psychiatric Institute . Dr. Mann speaks of a Danish study that followed 114 adopted boys  --  57 with a biological-family history of suicide , and 57 without . All the boys were raised by families with no history of suicide . Amazingly , the boys who later committed suicide had six times more biological relatives who had killed themselves than the boys who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that some people do seem genetically inclined that way , " says Dr. Mann . <p> But then , why do n't all people wired like this attempt suicide ? <p> Dr. Mann points out that most younger and middle-aged men who attempt suicide have a personality trait in common . " They show evidence of impulsivity , " he says . " They 're aggressive in most corners of their lives  --  sexually , financially , interpersonally . They show a propensity to act on their feelings . " <p> " SUICIDE IS WHAT men in my family do : They off themselves . Well , on my mom 's side of the family , they drink and smoke . " <p> Shane DuBow , a Chicago writer , is talking about his family 's penchant for ending their own lives . His father , Fred , and an uncle both killed themselves . <p> As DuBow , 29 , recounts life growing up with his father , it 's remarkable how normal it seemed . " He was always there for me ; he was an ideal dad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be counted on to show up . If my sister or I had a paper due in school , he 'd help us research it . And he was a marathon runner . He ran double marathons and ultramarathons , like the 100-mile Western States . What 's more , he was pretty much a single parent , since my mom worked out of town . " <p> What DuBow did n't know until he was older , though , was that every year or two his father would try to take his own life . " He was suicidal for most of my life , " DuBow says . " And I do n't think that his being suicidal was ever about any single thing . It was more free-floating . " <p> Though the elder DuBow saw a psychiatrist periodically , he was never diagnosed with a particular emotional or personality disorder . Yet one spring day in 1987 , while DuBow was away at Oberlin College , his father downed an overdose of sleeping pills , sequestered himself inside the family garage , and hooked up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's mother arrived home and found her husband dead , sitting in a comfortable chair beneath a clear-plastic tarp and holding the free end of the hose . The car had run out of gas . <p> " There was no note , no will , " DuBow says . In previous suicide attempts , his father had left behind letters and instructions . This time , however , the family found only oblique and poignantly haunting clues : Vivaldi 's The Four Seasons was cued on the stereo , family photos had been arranged on the mantel , and his father had dripped green candle wax in " waltzing arcs " on the living-room carpet . <p> DuBow says today that , while he 's never seriously considered suicide , the act re mains something that may well have been handed down to him along with the rest of his genetic code . And he struggles to understand the implications of that . " I have no way to be sure of this , " he says , " but I assume that once you feel the desire to commit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Those of us who do n't feel it , we ca n't really understand the need . My father ? Somehow , I think he did n't have a choice . " <p> IT 'S A COMPLEX ISSUE , this notion of suicide handed down from father to son . Is it simply a genetic predisposition ? Or does having a relative who committed suicide simply make killing oneself seem like more of a legitimate option ? <p> " It 's probably a combination of both factors , " says Yeates Conwell , M.D. , a psychiatrist at the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York . " Neither nature nor nurture works in a vacuum . So although a person may carry around an inherited predisposition , he also operates in a social sphere . Having a family history of suicide is n't enough , obviously , since not everyone with a family history of suicide kills himself . " <p> Instead , Dr. Conwell says that " suicide does n't happen out of the blue . It 's a coming-together of events and predispositions at a certain time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occur in all of us . " Feeling suicidal is an expression of extreme psychological stress ; it 's a coping mechanism , " he says . " Who has n't at least considered it , even from a healthy distance ? The question is , why do some people act on the impulse while most do n't ? The answer , unfortunately , is different for everyone  --  and different at different stages of life . " <p> IN OCTOBER OF 1982 , Eric Haseltine 's mother did n't show up for a concert date the two had made . Haseltine grew suspicious . He , his brother , and his two sisters knew that their mother saw a psychiatrist once a month and took prescription antidepressants  --  and that she had made an attempt on her life when they were children . She had gotten her life back together but , after she endured a marital separation and illness , Haseltine says , " her thinking began to shift in increments . " <p> " The day after the concert , I called my father and asked if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice going fiat . " He said , No , she 's disappeared somewhere . ' And I thought , she 's killed herself . So I went to her home . As I drove up , there were police cars . She had taken pills , washed them down with alcohol , then put a plastic bag over her head  --  so even if the pills failed , she 'd suffocate . She had left a note : If you find me , please do n't try to revive me . ' " <p> As the loss sunk in , Haseltine felt " profound sadness , " but also relief-for his mother and also for himself and the rest of the family . " My mother was in a great deal of emotional pain , and she had a lot of rage inside her , " he says . His sister Florence agrees . " After her death , there was a sense of relief that her pain was over , " she says . " We had been expecting it for so long , we had educated ourselves about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both Haseltine and his sister have been medically treated for cycles of depression , neither has ever attempted suicide . " I 've never really considered it , " he says . " I often just think , Well , I 'll go off by myself and nurse my misery for a while . ' " His sister Florence , a wife , mother , M.D. and Ph.D . who works at the National Institutes of Health , claims to have " gotten close " once  --  years ago  --  as a graduate student . These days , both siblings wage an ongoing war against depression . Haseltine takes maintenance doses of the prescription antidepressant Zoloft , and regularly monitors himself for signs of oncoming depressive bouts . <p> " When I start fearing a normal conversation , I know I 'm getting depressed , " he says . He informs his wife and doctor ; that occasionally merits a lift in his Zoloft dosages . Florence goes on antidepressants when she feels a bout coming on . " I 've taken lithium , Prozac , Zoloft , and they 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about monitoring depressive slides . " If I see even the first flashes of it , I get help , " she says . " I have this disease . I live with it every clay . I watch it very closely . I 'm very , very honest about it , because nothing is going to change until people can talk completely openly and honestly about it . " <p> FOR 10 YEARS , Dennis Klass , Ph.D. , a psychologist and professor of religious studies at Webster University in St. Louis , has counseled grieving and suicidal people . It 's a task that has given him some interesting perspectives . <p> " My own father committed suicide , " Klass says . " And I think what he did was rational . It was n't an impulsive decision , so it 's not something I worry about being banded on to me genetically . He had terminal cancer , and the doctors could n't control his pain . As the situation became unbearable and he saw no upside to living , he killed himself . And my response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . ' " <p> In Klass 's view , even the consideration of suicide can carry with it a form of relief . " In my clinical work , " he says , " I 've found that once a person considers that course-you know , realizes he can commit suicide if he wants to  --  he does n't want it . If you tell him , Okay ; there 's a gun in that drawer , ' he 'll decide against it . About 99.9 times out of 100 , he wants to live . He just did n't realize he had a choice . That 's all most of us really want options . Again , that 's applying a rational set of facts to the question . " <p> In psychologist-speak , the process is called rumination . Defined as a period of methodical and rational stock-taking , it 's where life 's big-picture pros and cons are compared until an answer is reached . " It 's a problem-solving process that men use quite a lot , " Klass says . " While women generally look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type of rational thinking by themselves . " This distinctly male method of thinking may partly explain why men are so much more prone to suicide than women . Klass says that , in their suicidal ruminations , men often forget a crucial consideration : " The best argument I know against taking your own life , " he says , " is that it passes along the pain . Especially if you 're an adult still caring for children . There are times and responsibilities in our lives that we do n't have the right to escape . We all know what they are , and we all should honor them . <p> " Which is very different from what my father did , " says Klass . " He had a grown family and no one to hurt but himself . For him , suicide was a rational choice , and one not linked to heredity . For the father of three young kids to commit suicide on impulse ? No . That 's unacceptable . " <p> SHANE DUBOW IS STILL puzzling over the effects heredity and environment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who kill themselves have a lot going on beyond what other people can see . It 's hard to stand on the outside and make any real sense of it . As for me , I have a sort of dark view of the world and of life , but it 's not one that includes my own suicide . " <p> Eric Haseltine sees it a little differently , but he also believes it all comes back to one thing : an underlying stressor . " Suicide is an angry act in some ways , " he says . " Many people say you commit suicide at someone or something . And I think that 's sometimes true . I think it was true in my mother 's case . " He pauses . " You know in the Star Wars trilogy , when they 're talking about the power of the dark side ? " he asks . " It 's true . It exists : the power and release that depression and suicide provide . If you give in to the acid of rage , it eventually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the result . I would say that all the stuff about this running in families is true . If you have depression or suicide in your family , you have to acknowledge it and respect it  --  that 's how you deprive it of its power . But you do n't have to give in . " STAYING AHEAD OF SUICIDE <p> If someone in your family has attempted or committed suicide , you may have a higher-than-normal risk of attempting it yourself . Although not everyone develops acute problems , there are steps you can take to keep suicidal thoughts from catching up with you : <p> Know your prescriptions , know yourself . Some drugs , especially antidepressants such as Paxil and Zoloft or antipsychotics like Risperdal , can increase suicide risk . Before you accept a prescription for these drugs , question your doctor about how you 'll be monitored . <p> But do n't play doctor . " The most common mistake depressed or suicidal people make is to stop taking their antidepressant medication , " says John Mann , MD. , a psychiatrist and neurologist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been given a prescription , use it . Or , if you feel you want to stop using it , check with your doctor before stopping . " <p> Stay off the bottle . You already know that drinking can intensify feelings of depression that may lead to suicide . But a recent study suggests that a specific gene may influence both suicide and alcoholism . Researchers at the National Institutes of Health found that subjects with variations in a specific gene ( called TPH ) were significantly more likely to be alcoholics , to have problems controlling their impulses , and to have a history of suicide attempts . <p> Stay involved in the world . " Isolation is a factor in many suicides , " says Yeates Conwell , M.D. , a psychiatrist at the University of Rochester Medical Center . " You need people to lean on in times of stress . Try to develop a network of people who you can really talk to , and who 'll point out to you when you 're in some sort of emotional trouble . " <p> Keep guns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mental Health , 61 percent of all suicides come from the end of a gun barrel , making firearms by far the most common toot in suicides . <p> Know the additional risk factors . It 's a recognized fact that epileptics have a 20- to 30-times-greater chance of committing suicide than the general population . People who have had strokes or frontal head injuries , or who have lost consciousness , also have higher rates of clinical depression and suicide than the population at large , says Dr. Mann . <p> Check your shoes . Most people miss the first symptoms of depression  --  mainly , the tendency to let things slide . If your place is suddenly a mess , you have n't been to the gym in weeks , and your shoes look scuffed and neglected , you might be entering a depressive episode . <p> Remember that you do n't have to feel this way . " Suicide is a very complex behavior , but it 's usually set off by a particular stressor , " says Dr. Mann . " If you remove the stressor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  his suicidal tendencies often disappear , " Dr. Mann says . " Our patient files are full of people who , after you treat the underlying disorder , ask themselves : Commit suicide ? What was I thinking ? ' "  --  D.
