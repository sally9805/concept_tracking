The elements are almost the stuff of comedy . Federal agents get wind of a surreptitious arms hoard . They then set up surveillance of a compound using 40-year-old agents passing as college students . Suddenly a raid on the compound is imminent  --  without a detailed plan on how to carry it out . A sketchy plan is then drawn up  --  and ignored . Meanwhile , the targets of the raid know something is up , and their watchers know that the targets know but still think surprise is a possibility . That 's where the comedy turns to tragedy . <P> " The decision to proceed was tragically wrong , not just in retrospect , but because of what the decision makers knew at the time . " Thus concluded a devastating 220-page critique of the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms issued by the Treasury Department last week . The Feb. 28 raid on David Koresh 's compound in Waco , Texas , resulted in the death of four ATF agents and six cult members and led to a 51-day siege and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including at least 17 children . The bureau , the report said , not only handled a sensitive situation ineptly but tried to cover up its bumbling with lies and obfuscations . As the study coldly noted , " There may be occasions when pressing operational considerations  --  or legal constraints  --  prevent law-enforcement officials from being . . . completely candid in their public utterances . This was not one of them . " <P> After the report was released , Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen , whose department is in charge of ATF , announced the replacement of the agency 's entire top management . Its boss , Stephen Higgins , who knew the report was going to be harsh , announced his retirement three days before . " It is now clear that those in charge in Texas realized they had lost the element of surprise before the raid began , " Bentsen said . The field commanders made " inaccurate and disingenuous statements " to cover up their missteps , putting the blame on agents . <P> ATF has had a tradition of going in with guns blazing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his Prohibition-era " Untouchables " were not FBI men , but rather direct predecessors of today 's ATF agents . ) The Branch Davidian saga was true to tradition . Little consideration was given to arresting David Koresh outside his Mount Carmel compound . Indeed , after its preliminary investigations , the ATF began preparing for what would be the biggest raid in its history . All it lacked was a plan  --  and the element of surprise . Even though a raid had been set for March 1 , the mandatory documents for such a plan were not ready by Feb. 23 . When acting Special Agent in Charge Darrell Dyer arrived from Kansas City and asked to see the paperwork , he found that none existed . In the next four days , Dyer and fellow agent William Krone drew up a plan  --  but it was never distributed . Meanwhile , Koresh was already suspicious , having noticed that the " college students " who had moved into a house near his 77-acre compound looked like people only a few years shy of their 25th reunion .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
