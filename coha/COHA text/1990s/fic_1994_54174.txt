JAMESON HATED Mr. Lang 's dogs . There were two of them . A dark , wiry little terrier , and a large mixed breed with long , shaggy ears . Mr. Lang left them in the yard all day and they yelped at the fence , standing side by side as if they were determined to outbark one another . <p> Jameson and his wife Mary were alone now , though they were happy with one another , and glad for the infrequent visits of their three children . Although Jameson was tired , and he sometimes worried about his heart , he gave the impression of youthful good health for a man in his mid-fifties . <p> Lang moved into the house across the street in late August , the two dogs jumping in the yard and tumbling at his feet while he walked around with a clipboard in his hand supervising the movers . He seemed much older than Jameson  --  perhaps already close to seventy . He had gray hair , and he was slightly stooped at the shoulders . He was very lean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved in Jameson sipped coffee and watched from his dining-room window . " It looks like our new neighbor lives alone , " he said . <p> Mary came up behind him and looked over his shoulder . " There 's no lady present ? " <p> " Not yet . " <p> " Well , we 'll go on over and say hello in a few days . After they 're settled . " <p> " I think it 's just him and the dogs . " <p> <p> By December , it was just the two dogs . That was all Jameson could think about . They barked all night . He 'd come home from work , exhausted , feeling as though he 'd been beaten , and as he got out of his car he 'd see the shadows by the fence , watching him , barking in the moonlight . <p> Long before the dogs got to be a problem  --  that is , before Jameson noticed that he was n't getting any sleep  --  he and Mary tried to welcome Mr. Lang . It could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished moving in when they walked over and knocked on his door . <p> They waited there , knocked again , louder . After a long pause , they turned to leave and the door opened . <p> " Yes ? " <p> " Oh , hello , " Mary said . <p> Lang did n't say anything . <p> Mary did all the talking . She told him who she was , then she introduced her husband . " We just came over to welcome you , Mr. - " She waited for him to fill in the blank . <p> Then she looked past him , seemed to be searching for something in the house . <p> He closed the door until it was only a dark slot . His face was barely visible in the poor light under the shade of the porch . <p> " I hope you 're getting yourself settled in , " Mary said . " We live right across the street there , if you need anything . " <p> " I 'm fine , " Lang said . There was an awkward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " And you 're  --  " Mary said . <p> But he was closing the door . He stopped , seemed to consider something , then he said , " I 'm Mr. Lang . " He might have smiled slightly . Jameson could n't tell . <p> Throughout September and October and even into November the dogs barked . It did n't seem to bother Mary at all . She only worked half of each day at the public library . When she got home , she 'd change into a comfortable pair of slacks , put on her tennis shoes , and go about cleaning the house or making bread or baking cookies and sweet cakes for Christimas . Jameson would come home in the late evening , tie loosened , the collar of his shirt open , his coat over his arm , and stagger toward the front door as though it were an escape hatch . His eyes always hurt him , felt wooden and dry . <p> He managed the home appliance department at J. C. Penney . He could not remember working anywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house and all that time he counted money , wrote sales tickets , and arranged shelves and displays of everything from toaster ovens to washers and dryers . <p> But now he was nearing sixty . He was worried about his heart . The year before Lang moved in with his dogs , there had been an episode of extraordinary pain in his chest and a brief , terribIe struggle for air . His hands were white and soaked . He told himself it was only an esophageal spasm . He 'd had one before  --  years ago . This last episode felt like that . It finally subsided , and though he was exhausted for days afterward , he did not truly believe he had had a heart attack . He did n't bother to tell Mary about it . She might worry or , worse , come to see a weakness in him that would alter how they lived ; would create a sort of initiation into old age . <p> Every day he got up in the morning hoping for energy . He felt as though he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When he did sleep , he dreamed of dogs ; of purple , slack lips and pointed teeth and long , pink tongues . <p> On some weekends in the late fall , he 'd see Lang out in his yard , raking leaves , or clipping his bushes , or washing his car . The dogs would be there , howling and yawping at him . <p> " Jesus Christ , " Jameson said one Sunday , " how does he stand it ? " <p> " Stand what ? " Mary said . She slouched in a blue lounge chair , watching television . <p> " That racket . You do n't hear that ? " <p> She had not put on much weight over the years , but the way she was sitting , her silver-rimmed glasses on the tip of her nose , her bulky sweater bunched at her waist , she looked fat and old . Without looking away from the television she said , " Why do n't you just forget about it ? " <p> " It 's driving me nuts . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One afternoon Jameson noticed the old man sweeping his walk . It was a breezy Saturday in November . The sun had begun to pale before a high mist . Mary said , " Well there he is . You wo n't even have to knock on his door . Go tell him . " <p> " Listen to them , " Jameson said . <p> Lang was where the dogs could see him , so they were crazy to get out . They jumped at the fence , made sounds that were almost human . It was hard for Jameson to believe that anything that was not suffering could make such a noise . <p> " Go on , " Mary said . <p> " I will , damn it . I will . " He went out the door and walked across the street . <p> Lang continued to sweep . <p> " Those dogs are sure anxious to get out , " Jameson said . <p> The old man looked over at them , nodded his head . His hair was tousled , stood almost straight up off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the veins in each arm seemed to spring from his elbow and grip him all along the forearm . He wore a gold watch with a thick band that was too big for him and slipped up and down his wrist as he moved the broom . <p> " So you 're all settled in then ? " <p> " Everything 's fine . " <p> " I 'm glad . " Jameson stood there . A cool breeze swirled around them , made a mess behind the broom . <p> Finally Lang looked at him . " You lived here long ? " <p> " Oh , it does n't seem like it , but I guess it 's been almost twenty years . " time . <p> The old man did n't say anything . <p> " I remember when that tree in your backyard was a sapling , " Jameson said . He was starting to feel at ease . " It does n't seem like twenty years at all . It 's like we moved in last month or something . Time moves so fast now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off his head . He stopped sweeping , leaned on the broom handle . He had cave-like gray eyes , dark shadows under them . The face was weathered and too long , as though it had been dried in the sun and stretched . " You know , " he said , " your soul does n't know a damn thing about time . Time 's only an invention . " <p> " Well , " Jameson said . He had not thought of his soul for a long <p> " The clock was invented in the twelfth century , " Lang said . He started sweeping again , a slight professorial wave of his left hand seeming to dismiss Jameson . " People got used to them . But inside . . . " he made a big sweep with the broom . . . " hell , in your head there ai n't no clock . Your memory do n't know between now or then . " <p> " I guess not . " Jameson wanted to say something about the dogs who had been barking , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . <p> " Huh ? " Lang looked at him again , apparently disappointed . <p> " The dogs . " <p> " What about them ? " The old man 's head shook slightly . Then he sniffed , wiped the back of his hand across his face . <p> " I wondered if you could do anything about their barking . " <p> " Well they 're dogs , are n't they ? " <p> " I ca n't sleep at night . " Jameson 's self-possession faltered . He was almost afraid , as though he were talking out of turn to his father . <p> Lang nodded , leaning on the broom . He looked as though he were being fed and he was waiting for the next spoonful . <p> " Is n't there something you can do ? " Jameson said . " I mean it 's really too much . " <p> " It is . " <p> " There are probably laws . . . " <p> " Yes . " <p> " Not that . . . I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Would you do something for me ? " Lang said . <p> " I 'd be glad to . You name it . " <p> " How would you like to bite my ass ? " <p> There was a pause , and then the old man resumed sweeping . For a moment Jameson thought of jumping him . But he only backed a few steps away , then turned and went home . <p> The walk back across the street was humiliating . It vexed Jameson terribly that he did not have the presence of mind , or perhaps the nerve , to take the old man 's broom and knock him down . He did not want to tell Mary what had happened . When she asked him what the old man said , Jameson told her he seemed very agreeable . <p> " See ? " she said . <p> " It 's one thing to say you 're going to do something , and quite another to actually do it . " <p> " He 'll take care of it . " <p> " We 'll see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jameson to describe himself , he might have given them a much more accurate picture than he would at first want to . There was nothing very ugly in him , and what he might try to hide about himself would be eventually overcome by the strongest attribute of his nature : a powerful desire that the truth of things be known . This was not just a simple wish to be honest . It was , rather , an infinite need for the earth 's termless register to have everything straight . In his job he kept accounts  --  there was a ledger for every transaction . He approached his life in a similar fashion . He kept track of all his gains , and of all he had lost to eternity . When he was a younger man it seemed that his losses were sometimes tremendous . If he was concentrating on something , reading the newspaper or trying to untangle the Christmas lights , and he came to realize that his daughter was talking to him , it did n't matter if he stopped himself finally and asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing the child said , that original voice , impatient perhaps , or laden with innocent joy , or fear , or new pride , was lost to him forever . <p> So on that day when Lang had cursed him , he went to bed a little later than Mary . He fixed himself a drink in the kitchen , sat there listening to her upstairs brushing her teeth . He went over all the eloquent , loud , and final things he wished he had said to Mr. Lang . When he finally went upstairs , Mary was already in bed , turned toward the window and the loud barking of the dogs . <p> " You know what really happened today ? " <p> She turned to him . " No . What ? " <p> He told her . He even told her what Lang said about time . <p> " Well , then maybe we should call the police . " <p> " I suppose . " <p> " He really told you to bite his ass ? " <p> " Yes . " He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back over and seemed to stare out the bedroom window . <p> For a while they were both silent . Then Mary said , " Why did you lie to me about it ? " <p> He sat down on the bed . He did n't know what to say to her . He hated to admit that he was ashamed of what happened . <p> " What we ought to do , " she said , beginning to drift toward sleep , " is go over there and kill those dogs . " <p> " All I know is , I need to sleep tonight . I really do . " <p> At three o'clock that morning he was still awake . Mary breathed silently next to him . The moon shone through the window frames and made things in the room look eerie and spiteful . Outside , in the breezeless cold , Lang 's dogs barked . <p> All night Jameson had rubbed his eyes and turned and snarled against the pillows . Every wrinkle in the sheets seemed to have substance , and he could not stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barking and giving it back to him as though it were an old song . Then he felt something very slight stir in his heart . <p> It was a very definite physical sensation  --  as though a penny had dropped through a valve into one of the dark chambers of his heart . He waited for something to happen . He did not want to move at first , although the night horrified him . The barking dogs made him think of " hounds , " and when that word came into his mind it charged him with fear . <p> And then he realized he could not take it anymore . <p> His eyes open wide , feeling like a crazy ghost  --  as though he were truly out of his own body and therefore away from reason and any demands of decorum or restraint  --  he rose from the bed . Mary did not stir . <p> He moved to the door , conscious only of his fear  --  waiting for his heart to stutter and collapse . He believed his next sleep would be death . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moon flooded the front hallway . Shadows of the trees and windowpanes cut the soft light into sharp fragments . Jameson opened the hall closet , retrieved his boots and a long coat . Then he went into the dark kitchen , opened the silverware drawer , and picked out an eight-inch chef 's knife . <p> The front door groaned when he opened it . The dogs seemed to know he was coming , their howls increasing . He waited for a sound from upstairs . There was nothing . No one to stop him . <p> In the street he felt his heart flutter again . It seemed to shrink and grow cold in his chest as though it were touched by ice . He was afraid his heart would stop and he would fall on the knife . He saw the two dogs , both on their hind legs , jumping at the fence now , barking furiously . <p> Lang 's house was dark . Jameson moved to a patch of black grass under a tree in the front yard . He was suddenly very cold . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was close enough now to see the steam from the open mouths of the dogs . They watched him , paused in their barking as though waiting to see what he would do . <p> Then he heard a phone ringing somewhere . The smaller dog seemed to hear it too . It turned its head and yelped , did not seem to know what to bark at . Jameson held the knife at his side , witnessed the confusion of the smaller dog , saw it regain its purpose and bark with conviction at him , only a shadow in the shadow of the tree . And a light came on in the rear of Lang 's house . It made a yellow square on the white grass in the darkness behind the dogs . The ringing stopped , and then Jameson seemed to awaken . The cold air encircled him , swallowed his eyes . In the noise of the dogs , with the knife in his frozen hand , he felt as though he had climbed down out of one of his own nightmares . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an odd sort of awed curiosity that here he was , in the middle of the night , coming back to life under his neighbor 's sycamore tree . <p> As he turned back to his own house , the dogs paused again , and he thought he heard once again a ringing phone . <p> The next day it snowed . The whole world was bright and silent . Jameson called in sick and slept most of the day . When Mary came home she noticed that the dogs were no longer in the yard . <p> " He must have taken them in the house , " Jameson said . <p> " Well , in this weather I should hope so . " <p> Jameson coughed . <p> " You 're not coming down with a cold , " Mary said . <p> " I slept all day . I feel rested . " <p> " Good . " Mary smiled and touched his cheek , then went upstairs to change her clothes . <p> Jameson went into the family room and took his pulse . It seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure . During the long afternoon of uncertain sleep a heavy , almost hot pressure seemed to swell in his ribcage . He could not be sure if it was a dream , or something that truly happened to his heart . Because he had slept so long , the panic that attended him when he first waked late that afternoon had now left him . The snow and the sun-warmed windows of the family room calmed him . He was very happy that Mary was home . <p> Presently he heard a clatter outside and went to the window . Mr. Lang was in his front yard , opening and closing the gate on his chain-link fence . He wore a black ski cap , orange sweatpants , and an oversized gray parka . Dense white steam puffed from his mouth . Something about the gate would not work . He slammed it , caught it as it bounced back open and slammed it again . The dogs were nowhere to be seen . <p> When Mary came down , Jameson called her to the window . " Look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " I do n't know . " <p> Lang slammed the gate again . Then he stood back and looked at it . With exaggerated politeness he bowed , then he took the latch of the gate in his black gloved fingers as though he were taking a dainty hand to kiss , and he leaned over and very carefully placed the latch in the slot . The gate closed firmly now , he stepped back , and bowed again . <p> " I do n't like him , " Mary said . <p> Jameson watched him move back through the deep snow on his front walk . Lang stepped up onto his porch , holding the rail and taking it one step at a time . <p> " I wonder  --  " Jameson said , thinking of the old man 's heart . <p> " What ? " <p> " Nothing . " <p> Later in the afternoon Jameson went outside to shovel the snow from his driveway and the front walk . The dogs were back outside , lunging back and forth in the snow along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silence of the snow . <p> Jameson worked steadily , trying to avoid strain . He did not want to be out of breath . It was still very cold . The snow was a light powder , and the shovel moved under it cleanly . <p> When he had finished the walk and moved to the driveway , Mary came out . She walked down the cleared walk to where he was standing . " Want some hot chocolate ? " <p> " When I 'm done . " <p> " You sure are taking your time . Are you OK ? " <p> He stopped , took a deep breath . " I do n't want to strain my back . " <p> The dogs yelped across the street . Mary looked over there . " I feel sorry for them . " <p> " Yeah . " <p> " You want me to call the police ? " <p> " It would n't do any good . " <p> Sometime in the middle of that night Jameson called information and got Lang 's phone number . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He dialed the number as though it were a responsibility . It rang many times . When the old man answered in a voice groggy and stifled by interrupted sleep , Jameson quietly put down the receiver . He waited for an hour and then dialed the number again . This time it did not ring so many times . <p> " Please , " Lang said . <p> Jameson hung up . Then he went to the sink and got a drink of water . He felt wonderful , even youthful . Although he had slept fitfully most of that day , he could not remember the last time he was unconscious  --  truly unconscious . It seemed as though he had been awake for months . But the call gave him tremendous energy . He sat by the phone and dialed Lang 's number several times . He let it ring and ring . Each time he called , the old man would finally answer  --  as though he were driven by animal sleep to respond to the stimulus of the ringing bells . <p> Again the following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a very long time . Jameson took a seat at the kitchen table and set the phone down in front of him . He fixed himself a Manhattan , sat back and sipped his drink , watching the receiver . It purred like a living thing . Then he heard the old man 's voice . <p> As he picked up the phone to place it back in its cradle he heard Mr. Lang say again , " Please . " <p> He put the receiver to his ear . <p> " Please , son , " Lang said . " Please do n't do this anymore . ' <p> Jameson waited . <p> Lang said , " My boy . " His voice was barely a whisper . He was apparently making a tremendous effort to hold back emotion . " I know it 's you , son . " There was a long pause while Jameson listened to hurried breathing . Then , in a stronger voice , the old man went on . " I ca n't do anything but say I 'm sorry . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He paused again , and Jameson thought he was going to hang up , but then he said , " Bobby ? Talk to me . OK ? Just say hello . " Now he was loud . " Say anything . Will you ? I know you 're listening to me . Would your mother want this ? You want me to go all over it again ? You want me to say it again ? Bobby ? " There was an odd sound  --  the old man 's voice seemed to give out . He whispered something Jameson did n't understand , then broke the connection . <p> Jameson did not finish his drink . He crept upstairs to his bed and settled himself there as if he were pursued by something . He felt nothing for the old man , yet he was gripped by a sensation very much like panic . He curled up next to Mary and shivered against her , trying to calm himself . <p> Then he was gone for a time , drifting in troubled sleep . He dreamed of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window in darkness ; of winter and bare trees and peace . Somewhere in the lightless space of his dreams , he heard his father call out to him . There was a field , with tall grass , and a wooden fence leaning slightly under a dull sun , and he was running with other children , wind blowing his hair . His father 's voice called him home , and he stopped , feeling the wind grow cold , the sun gulped by clouds . This was the beginning of so many violent storms of his youth : a swift race across familiar ground to warmth and safety , to his father 's front porch and the warm parlor of his home . In the dream , he could not get there at first , the house receding farther and farther into the gray distances of the field . Something far down in his memory began to weep . And then he was warm again , in the light of his own house , being admired by his mother and father as he always had been . <p> He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the window and looked out . It was still very dark , and the streetlights were blurred by swirling new snow . <p> " What 's the matter ? " Mary said . <p> " Nothing . " <p> " The dogs ? " <p> " I do n't hear them . It 's quiet over there . " <p> " Come back to bed . " <p> " I will . " He waited by the window , listening to the rhythm of her breathing as she returned to sleep . He remembered his solitary visit to the shadows in Lang 's front yard . The sound of the phone and the sudden light on the white grass seemed completely imaginary , like something he only thought of briefly while shoveling snow . <p> " Mary , " he whispered . The sound of her breathing told him she was sleeping . " It 's snowing again . " <p> " Hmmmmm ? " She did not hear him . <p> The new snow saddened him . It came down like memory , softly and in silence under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into words what he was feeling . This night seemed the very start of the end of something . And yet , in the midst of his profound sadness  --  a sadness very much like grief  --  he felt both cruel and divine . The sights and sounds , the feelings and impressions of all his days came back to him now as though only a vague memory of a lost dream . He remembered his own absent children , who were other people now and rarely called ; he remembered their small hands , their fragrant , freshly-washed hair , their laughter , their tears . He remembered his wife 's bright eyes , a whole life of kindness . And time . The strange passage of time . <p> He remained there in the darkness at the window , watching Lang 's house , the streetlight and its eerie shadows , the branches of the black trees turning white in the gathering snow , as though it were a restful sight ; as though he were a man who did not need sleep . <p> <p> By ROBERT BAUSCH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
