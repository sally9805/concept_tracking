Section : success stories <p> A professional scenic painter for the Metropolitan Opera , New York City artist fill Biskin also makes egg tempera paintings that evoke the drama of the stage at an astonishingly small size . <p> Jill Biskin 's egg tempera paintings are small and mysterious , presenting scenes from an illogical world filled with vivid and enigmatic detail . Some appear to be performances and take place on stage or at the circus ; others are less overtly theatrical yet still have a dramatic and dreamlike feeling . Most contain tiny human figures acting out unknown dramas , and many are decorated with bits of a script . <p> Her paintings are at once a reaction against and a complement to her other artistic projects : Biskin works full time as a scenic painter for the Metropolitan Opera in New York City . There , in direct contrast to her precise , miniature egg temperas , she creates backdrops so enormous that they are completed on the floor using paintbrushes the size of brooms . While these two types of work differ greatly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , in terms of both their subject matter and the artist 's interest in surfaces . <p> Biskin says her small paintings begin with a specific compelling image , sometimes observed and sometimes remembered . She keeps a bank of these " idea-visions " in the form of sketches and written notes and finds that as she develops one into a painting , other images " begin to creep in , " she explains , so that the final work is usually a composite of the real and the imagined . Many of her paintings begin with objects that have a surreal appearance . These works take on what she calls " an unexpected visual pageantry , " as when an apparently banal scene suddenly becomes interesting because of an accident of lighting or a convergence of figures . Other images come directly from dreams . <p> Biskin paints in egg tempera on wood panels less than twelve inches square , which she prepares with traditional glue gesso . Executed in miniature , these paintings capture the distance and smallness of a scene viewed through a telescope or of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a powerful sense of attraction and closely engages the viewer . Delicate , varied surfaces containing areas of gold leaf , oil glazing , and a range of treatments , including brushwork , sponging , scraping , burnishing , and even airbrushing , reinforce this sense of attraction . In part , Biskin uses egg tempera because of its versatility ; another reason is its affinity to water-color , a medium she has worked with since her childhood . <p> Although Biskin grew up in Texas , her summers were always spent at Chautauqua in western New York , where she sketched in water-color constantly . Later , she earned a B.F.A . degree at the Rhode Island School of Design in Providence and then , in 1976 , went on to study academic realism at the Studio of Nerina Simi in Florence , Italy . She credits this academic training with honing her discipline and drawing skills . On the basis of the work Biskin completed there , she received an Elizabeth T. Green shields grant to continue painting in Italy for another year . She moved to Rome and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piazzas . These spaces fascinated her because of their architecture and also because of the visual tension created by the figures moving through them . Her current work relates strongly to these earlier water-colors , although her settings are now often imagined rather than real . <p> Upon her return to New York from Italy in 1979 , Biskin began to study scenic painting and almost immediately began to free-lance on a variety of theatrical productions . She earned her union card in 1982 and has worked for the Metropolitan Opera since 1984 . Many of the theatrical elements in her paintings reflect this unusual and extraordinary world . <p> The Cyrillic characters that appear on banners and billboards in many of her works derive from her behind-the-scenes experience at the Opera , where many of her coworkers are Soviet emigres who read Russian-language newspapers during their breaks . Attracted to the look and shapes of the characters , Biskin began to learn the Russian alphabet and now uses these letters to form nonsense words that function in her paintings as both mysterious messages and beautiful , abstract designs . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because they are too impermanent . However , her small pictures reflect an ongoing interest in experimenting with mediums and methods that clearly relates to her theatrical work . Scenic painters are responsible for surface treatments on stage sets , backdrops , and some props , and they learn to create an astonishing range of effects and images , from architectural details to copies of master paintings . <p> For an upcoming production , for instance , Biskin was assigned the task of copying Van Gogh 's Cornfield With Crows . To recreate the look of Van Gogh 's brushwork at an enormous size , she mixed thick laundry starch into casein paint , creating a heavy texture , and then dragged a rake over the painted surface to simulate his impastoed brushstrokes . After this mixture had dried , she accentuated the marks with shadows and highlights . The challenge of creating such unusual effects keeps her constantly researching new ways of working and has made her especially sensitive to nuances of surface in her own paintings . <p> Productions at the Metropolitan Opera are especially lavish . Although backdrops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; productions are filmed for television , and television close-ups reveal details that are not apparent to a theater audience . The backdrops are particularly overwhelming in size : Biskin recently painted one measuring about thirty-five by forty-five feet . The piece started out as a small sketch prepared by the set designer , which Biskin then enlarged and transferred by means of a grid to a backdrop ( in this case , a cotton mesh fabric known as scrim ) . While painting the scrim , which was suspended vertically , Biskin worked in a standing position on walkaways that serve as scaffolding . Two walkaways in the theater are located above one another on adjacent floors of the building , and scenic painters move upstairs and downstairs from one walkaway to the next as they work . They apply paint with a variety of methods , raising and lowering the canvas in order to reach all of the sections . <p> Obviously , the contrast in scale between such gigantic paintings done backstage at the Metropolitan Opera and the small panels completed at a table in her studio is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have more in common with each other than with the middle ; the miniature and the gigantic share a quality of separateness from the everyday and life-size . <p> The vivid light and imagery of Biskin 's settings are the elements of her small paintings that most clearly evoke the theater . Like stage scenery , these settings establish the emotional tone of the piece as well as set the scene physically . Her backgrounds also have the flat feel of painted backdrops ; buildings function more as facades of elaborate decoration than as cubic volumes of space . In this way , the paintings resemble icons and can be linked stylistically to early Christian panel paintings . <p> The communalities between Biskin 's own paintings and her backstage work are obvious . However , the artist says it is difficult for her to determine how one influences the other . In some ways , she paints the way she does because she is a scenic painter for the theater ; in other ways , she was drawn to her profession because of the way she paints . <p> Biskin has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her most recent solo show was at the Kurts gingham Gallery in Memphis , Tennessee , in September . <p> PHOTO(COLOR):Opposite page : The Pawnbroker 's Dilemma , 1989-90 , egg tempera on wood with gold leaf , 11 x 19 .
