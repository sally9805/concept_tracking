Section : Kids And Money Survey Credit . Interest . Saving . Many children do n't understand these concepts . What you can do . <p> Stephanie Carlson is barely out of high school , and already she 's a credit risk . It took the 19-year-old from Salt Lake City only five months of buying clothes , jewelry , makeup , groceries , and gasoline to run up $7000 in credit-card debt and unpaid tuition . She 's now in credit counseling and learning to live plastic-free . But she wishes she 'd learned more about credit cards before the binge began . <p> " I know people just like me , " she says . " I 'm telling them not to get started . Once you get started , you ca n't stop . " <p> A new generation of young people is starting out life unprepared for temptations like easy credit . New research , including a national survey for Consumer Reports of 689 12-year-olds from various economic back-grounds , shows significant gaps in children 's personal-finance knowledge . This reason of " buying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only 72 percent knew that credit cards are a form of borrowing . Four in 10 did n't know that banks charge interest on loans . Guess who 's providing schools with free personal-finance curricula ? Visa , MasterCard and other financial institutions , whose messages often promote bad money habits . High-school seniors are particularly uninformed about savings and investment , according to a survey last spring by the Jumpstart Coalition , a partnership of business , government , and nonprofit groups based in Washington , D.C. <p> " We have a real problem , " says Elizabeth Schiever , director of high-school financial planning for the nonprofit National Endowment for Financial Education in Denver . " We need to educate kids before they get into bad habits . " A future in jeopardy <p> Compounding the problem is the fact that kids will make more consumer decisions than previous generations . By the time today 's kids turn 20 , they will have seen or heard 360,000 30-second TV commercials , says the nonprofit TV-Free America . And they will have received more than $33,000 in income and money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poll and James U. McNeal , professor of marketing at Texas A &M; University . <p> That 's not lost on advertisers salivating over a market that grows at 20 percent a year , McNeal says . Kids ages 5 to 14 spent $24.4 billion in 1996 , and directly influenced another $117 billion spent on their behalf , according to Packaged Facts , a New York-based research firm . <p> Moreover , credit is easier to come by than ever . Sixty-four percent of college students have a credit card in their name , and 20 percent have four or more cards , says the Roper College Track Financial Services Survey . Since employers are increasingly checking job applicants ' credit record , kids with a bad record may find it hard to obtain work to pay back their debts . At the Consumer Credit Counseling Service of Los Angeles , college students make up 10 to 15 percent of those seeking money-management help , says executive director Gary Stroth . <p> Later in life , this generation may need to be more financially disciplined and self-reliant than their baby-boomer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fill in the gaps . Traditional pensions have yielded to self-managed plans , such as the 401(k) , that require investment knowledge . <p> So it 's alarming that only 14 percent of high-school seniors surveyed by Jumpstart knew that stocks were a higher-growth investment in the long term than savings bonds , savings accounts , and checking accounts . <p> " Kids are coming out of school , and they do n't have a clue , " says Jane Schuchardt , family-economics program leader at the U.S. Department of Agriculture 's Cooperative State Research Education and Extension Service . <p> Our survey of 12-year-olds polled a slightly higher socioeconomic sample in a different test situation , and questions were geared to a younger grade level , so results are n't entirely comparable . On the bright side , nearly all kids knew that a bank loan is a form of borrowing . But one-third could n't calculate simple interest . When asked what advice they 'd give about buying a bike , only 62 percent recommended reading a lot about different brands . Just 72 percent recommended asking a parent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are so uninformed is that personal finance is n't taught systematically in schools . Unlike in Japan , where such a curriculum is mandatory , the subject is approached in the U.S. through a patchwork of public and private initiatives . <p> Twenty-six states mandate consumer education , and only 14 require a personal-finance component . Most mandates were created in the 1970s , riding the crest of the consumer movement . Since the first half of the 1980s , only a few states have added initiatives ; several have withdrawn theirs . <p> Ironically , as interest in such requirement has flattened , signs of their success are emerging . Adults who grew up in state where personal-finance education was mandated in high school are saving nearly 5 percent more money than their peers , says a July study by the nonprofit National Bureau for Economic Research , a Cambridge , Mass. , group that analyzes the American economy . Their net worth is higher by roughly a year 's worth of earnings . <p> Notably , the mandates seems to have had a greater influence on adults whose own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " These results contribute to the growing body of evidence that education may be a powerful tool for stimulating personal saving , " the report concludes . <p> A model for state mandates may be Illinois . Every high-school senior must complete a one-semester course to graduate . At Oak Park and River Forest High School , in an upper-middle-class suburb of Chicago , students learn about comparison-shopping , advertising , consumer fraud , how to complain , earning and managing income , saving and investing , credit management , and how to pick professionals such as lawyers . <p> In 1986 , Illinois began allowing students to bypass the course if they passed a proficiency exam . Just a few kids at Oak Park and River Forest pass each year . " It established for us that kids are not acquiring this through living and working and shopping and buying , " says Hayden Green , chairman of the school 's applied-arts division . " It does n't just come automatically from growing up . " The private sector <p> In most states , whether to teach consumer and personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teachers . The results range from entire courses to just a few hours in an economics or math class . Middle-schoolers in particular get short-changed ; when Zillions , our magazine for young people 8 and up , asked readers in 1996 how much time they 'd spent during the past year learning about managing money , more than two-thirds said " none . " <p> It 's crucial to teach children how to manage money and be smart consumers . And the materials used to teach them should be objective . <p> But the reality for many school districts is that there 's no money for personal-finance materials . Instead , many are using free handouts provided by credit-card issuers , banks , investment houses , publishers , and insurance companies . The materials are rarely objective , and many we saw give bad advice to students . <p> One program that needs overhauling is Visa 's Choices &; Decisions curriculum . A workbook section called " How Deep Can They Go ? " tells kids it 's reasonable to spend up to 20 percent of their net income , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credit-card bills . <p> It 's wrong to encourage kids to ring up that kind of debt , says April Lewis , director of educational services for the nonprofit Consolidated Credit Counseling Services in Fort Lauderdale , Fla . " When they 're out of school and heavy consumers it will just make the problems worse . " <p> Visa encourages kids to pay more than the monthly minimum payment due . But in its booklet , " Kids , Cash , Plastic and You , " distributed to the public , MasterCard International says only to pay your monthly installment on time . It does n't mention the best strategy : Carry no monthly balance at all . An added outrage is that the U.S. Office of Consumer Affairs helped sponsor both programs . <p> The Stock Market Game is a popular 10-week contest for some 650,000 students , who buy and sell individual stock to get the highest return . But the sponsor , the Securities Industry Foundation for Economic Education , allows kids to trade on a whim and buy on margin - practices that would make average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American Bankers Association Education Foundation makes no mention of alternative , possibly less expensive options to banks , namely credit unions . <p> Schools should be ad-free zones , where students can learn without commercial pressures , educational experts say . We agree . In 1995 , we exposed commercialism in schools in our report " Captive Kids . " The days , Connecticut is the latest state to confront creeping commercialism . <p> Last summer , the state legislature passed a bill encouraging , but not requiring , consumer education in schools . The state Department of Education is experiencing the aftermath of those good intentions : A deluge of proposals from companies anxious to get their materials in the classroom . <p> " What we need to do is sift through this and . . . cull from it information that will help students , " says Tom Murphy , a department spokesman . <p> We contend that there is a better solution - making noncommercial programs on personal finance and consumer education available to all students . Ironically , a funding mechanism exists . In 1994 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money to " promote consumer , economic , and personal finance education . " But no money has been appropriated , says Rosella Bannister , executive director of the nonprofit National Institute for Consumer Education . " The last time I tried to push anyone in Congress , the reaction was , ' Hey , this is not a priority , ' " she says . Tips : What parents can do . . . <p> Given the spotty school curriculum , it 's more important than ever that parents teach about personal finance . <p> They can go a long way toward helping their children fight the " gimmes " and develop into smart consumers and good citizens by focusing on three key areas : <p> Family finances . Children learn by example . Make a point of talking through the financial decisions you make each day , so your kids learn that even adults make trade-offs and do n't always buy . The effort can be a springboard for teaching about broader concepts such as self-discipline , sharing , and decision-making . <p> Advertising . For most children , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their strongest desires often stem from TV ads . Talk to your children about ads , and help them decode commercials . Do they expect the doll to come to life , as the ad suggests ? Do they need an other action figure , or would they rather spend their money on something they do n't already have ? When parents help kids dissect ads , the power of these commercials is deflated . <p> Your child 's finances . Kids who have a say in how they spend and save their money make for more informed consumers , our research has found . Guide your children , but let them choose what they want to buy with their allowance . Let them help decide how to best invest their savings - in a bank account , stock , or other vehicle . Compare interest rates and fees ; let children fill out deposit slips . <p> The following tips come from our experts at Zillions and from the work of Sharon M. Danes , associate professor at the University of Minnesota , who has studied how children 's money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For young children <p> Even the youngest kids begin to learn about money management when concrete objects are used to illustrate concepts . They also begin to understand the consequences of their choices . * Let children pay for an item and receive change when you go grocery-shopping. * Pay 10 percent interest on savings , and have the children hold the interest in their hands . * Play " store " with fake money . * Borrow or rent a video , and have children return it . * Read books that allow kids to reflect on their own behavior , such as " The Berenstain Bears Get the Gimmes , " by Jan and Stan Berenstain. * Give kids an allowance . * Consider using jars or envelopes for money for savings , spending , and other things . <p> Encourage children to copy your charity giving . Seven-year-old Bobby Hays of Snohomish , Wash. , gives 10 percent of his $1-a-week allowance to his Mormon church ; his parents also tithe . " They told me to try it , " he says , " and it became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kids can comprehend long-term savings and goals . As kids get older , they also become more aware of status objects for peer approval ; parents can help them deal with this . * Compare prices of " status " products children may want with cheaper alternatives . Help them explore whether " in " is worth the price . * Brainstorm homemade gifts kids can make for the holidays , so kids do n't equate value with price paid . * Help your child compose a complaint leter about a faulty item , or accompany them to return it . * Establish rules for borrowing money . Charge interest . * Identify tasks for extra money ; yard work and cleaning were among such jobs kids mentioned in a 1996 job survey by Zillions . <p> Establish what you 'll pay for and what your kids should pay for . Elfie Schneider of Grafton , Wisc. , makes clear her dollar limit on clothing . Sons Matthew , 11 , and Michael , 13 , pay the difference on costlier clothes . " They check the clearance racks , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need or a want , and how bad do I really need or want this ? ' " she reports . . . . for teens <p> Continue the focus on long-term goals . * Involve children in planning the budget for a family event or vacation . * Let your teen-ager shop for groceries . * Discuss how auto insurance works . Investigate auto-financing and college-financing options together . * Compute miles per gallon on the family car ; compare it with alternative transportation . * Discuss the positives and negatives of credit-card use . <p> Increase opportunities to budget . Janice Hayhoe , 16 , of Lexington , Ky. , helps with the family finances . She says she has learned how to save . Now , when she goes to camp or on trips with her friends , she says she 's " normally the one who ends up coming home with money . " <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : By the time kids turn 20 , they will have received more than $33,000 in income and gifts of money . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school are saving 5 percent more than their peers . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Kids who got an allowance for a long time , and who controlled some of their money , did the best on our survey . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Visa says it 's OK to spend 20 percent of net income , after housing costs , paying credit-card and installment debt . That 's bad advice . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Thirty-eight percent of kids we surveyed di n't know that a boom box would cost more if they paid by credit-card installments than if they paid cash . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Parents need to help kids dissect ads . In our survey , 34 percent of kids did n't know you ca n't tell how good a product is by how much it 's advertised . <p> ALLOWANCES A smart start <p> Most parents say an allowance should be earned ; others feel it 's an entitlement . What 's important , experts say , is to be sure your child has the opportunity to earn or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why give an allowance ? It 's the basic tool for learning about family values , comparison-shopping , and setting priorities . In our survey , kids who receive allowances understood more consumer and financial concepts than those who did n't . And kids who get an allowance feel better about their ability to handle money , according to a 1996 poll of 784 readers age 9 to 14 of Zillions , our children 's magazine . <p> Many experts say it 's good to begin an allowance when a child is 6 to 8 years old and is comfortable with numbers . How much to give depends on what you expect your child to pay for . An oft-cited rule of thumb - a dollar a week for every year of age - seems excessive to many parents , unless a child is expected to pay for , say , his friends ' birthday presents . <p> For 6- to 8-year-olds , the average weekly allowance is $2 , according to a national survey by Yankelovich Partners Inc . For 9- to 12-year-olds , it 's $5 ; and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fourteen- to 15-year-olds get $10 ; 16- to 17-year-olds , $11 , the Yankelovich study said . Consider giving an allowance in small denominations . Children who get four quarters rather than a dollar bill may be more likely to save a portion than spend it all . Pay up on Sunday night , or whenever kids wo n't be headed to stores , so they do n't blow the money right away . Make even young kids use their allowance to pay for some things , like sweets . Up the ante as they get older . Stick to a payment system everyone understands . To avoid bickering , give the same amount to kids less than two years apart in age , says Janet Bodnar , author of the money guide , " Mom , Can I Have That ? " Do n't interfere with how children spend their allowance . In our survey , kids who controlled their money knew more about the subject than kids who had no control . Five dollars blown on a shoddy toy can be money well spent on consumer education . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but want or need something else . Part of the lesson here is that resources are limited . Kids learn by facing the consequences of their actions . Do n't dock an allowance for unrelated bad behavior , like fighting with siblings . That defeats the purpose . Use other forms of discipline . Be reliable . Your kids should be able to depend on getting a certain amount each week , like a salary . <p> ILLUSTRATION <p> HOW 12-YEAR-OLDS ANSWERED OUR SURVEY <p> Most kids did OK overall , but the questions shown here reflect trouble spots .
