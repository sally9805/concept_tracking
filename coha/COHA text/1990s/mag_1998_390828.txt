Section : THE TOP 50 CD 'S EDITORS ' CHOICE FOR SCHOOL AND AFTER SCHOOL : THE YEAR 'S BEST CD-ROMS <p> COMPUTERS HAVE NEVER been a better value . Low-end models are almost as powerful as last year 's top-of-the-line . They 're cheap , too . Not surprisingly , parents with school-age kids are snapping up PCs as eagerly as other first-time buyers . Once you 've set up your new home system , the question becomes : how best to use it ? <p> Though going online is one obvious choice , CD-ROMs still ca n't be topped for consistent quality and value . And , though some include links to the Internet , CD-ROMs are for the most part a closed  --  and thus a safe  --  environment for kids . No unwanted e-mail from strangers , no chance of exposure to inappropriate stuff . But navigating store shelves packed with software boxes can be as daunting as searching the Web for kid-friendly content . <p> To help , we 've picked the 50 best CD-ROMs of 1998 . We broke down our favorite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids , preteens and high schoolers , plus a section for the whole family . On the young end of the range , we encourage parents to take the age categories with a grain of salt ; we 've found that age appropriateness ' is often better determined by kids themselves than software makers . As a guide , though , we put suggested age ranges at the end of each review . <p> Within the categories , you 'll find a variety of subjects including reading , math , science , geography and problem-solving . Look in The Whole Family ' section for recommendations of software from reference , trip planning and greeting-card making to the best virtual pet . Overall , the class of 1998 was exemplary : every CD-ROM elicited raves from our reviewers for ease of installation , reliability and superb graphics and sound . This year , the phrase fun to use ' and as good as TV ' cropped up with intriguing regularity . <p> But for pure entertainment , you ca n't beat games . And to show that we 're not all work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our top 50 for the best CD-ROM games for PCs . Competition was fierce : games reviewer Tom Ham says he picked his top 10 from a field of about 200 games . ( Parents are duly cautioned that most CD-ROMs in the games section contain animated violence . ) So whether it 's high marks you 're after  --  or just high scores  --  there 's something for everyone in the following pages . PRESCHOOLERS TABLE <p> HELPING VERY YOUNG CHILDREN learn pre-academic skills can be ticklish business . Led by the furry red monster from Sesame Street , ' Elmo 's Reading uses the popular preschool series ' most beloved characters to help children master the different facets of early reading . Reading Basics , the first of the program 's two CDs , places Elmo in a library of magic books . Each book in the library leads to a scene in which one of the Sesame Street ' Muppets welcomes children into their choice of six reading activities . In Zoetry Poetry , Beatnik Zoe invites kids into her poetry reading , where they can help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chef Cookie Monster whips up treats for waiter Grover to deliver to restaurant patrons and asks kids to help spell them . The second of the two discs , Reading Adventure , is designed to allow children to apply the basics they learned in CD one . Some preschoolers may not have patience for CD swap- ping , which this program requires . But parents would do well to convince them the wait is worth it . They  --  and Elmo  --  will be tickled . Ages 3-6 . TABLE <p> POOR ARTHUR . IN THIS LIVELY animated storybook and activities program , everybody 's favorite aardvark has dug himself deep into another dilemma : he 's dying to play his favorite computer game , Deep Dark Sea , but his mother admonishes him not to turn on the computer until she comes home from work . Arthur does , of course . The adventure that ensues goes a step beyond other animated storybooks , offering not only a story with clickable elements , but age-level interactive activities that could stand by themselves . In the program 's Treasure Hunt activity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words with objects . When they enter a store , they learn to count money and follow directions by buying assorted accessories for a toy collection . No more moola ? It 's on to the program 's interactive cafE , where they can earn coins by helping to prepare lunch . Then kids can try their hand at Deep Dark Sea , the game that caused all of Arthur 's problems in the beginning . Moms , beware . Once you install this software , your kids may get as addicted as Arthur . Ages 3-7 . TABLE <p> LET 'S GO READ IS BUILT AROUND the metaphor of a tropical island . And this is one island you might not mind your children being stranded on for a while . Letter Island , as it is called , is a land of phonics skills and simple word construction brought to life by virtual tour guides Robby Raccoon and Emily Squirrel . The varmint duo guides the kids through 20 interactive environments . They can match letter sounds to words at the Tee Shirt Hut , do sight reading in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But what sets Let 's Go Read apart from the competitors is its voice-recognition feature that allows players to hear and practice vowel and consonant sounds . In one game , kids challenge letters of the alphabet to a game of virtual hide-and-seek , coaxing letters out of their hiding places by repeating the appropriate sounds into the microphone . ( But it can be tricky to activate on some machines . Not to worry . You can also use the mouse to operate the program 's activities . ) The program gives children complete lessons , letter by letter ; the idea is that once a child has worked through the alphabet , he or she will be able to sound out words with relative ease . Now , if you could just drop the kids off on the Island of Arithmetic . Ages 4-6 . TABLE <p> LIKE MOVIES , SUCCESSFUL CD-ROMs beget sequels . In this Humongous Entertainment title , underwater sleuth Freddi Fish returns for her third deep-sea adventure . Someone has stolen the Conch Shell , and it 's up to Freddi and her impatient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CD-ROM challenges kids to make connections between seemingly unrelated events in the story . ( For instance , a set of pliers found in one scene should be picked up and used later . ) The program provides your children with an ocean 's worth of problems to solve that actually require some thinking . As usual with Humongous , the stellar animation brims with interactive hot spots , giving the disc color and humor . Humongous has designed the game to be different every time kids play  --  it 's got a new culprit and new clues each time they pop it in . Though from what we 've seen , children find Freddi adventures so entertaining they would n't mind playing the same game over and over . Ages 3-8 . TABLE <p> DR . SEUSS PRESCHOOL WILL CHARM you with the same whimsy that makes the original books so ageless . The Cat and his friends are the stars of Dr. Seuss Preschool , an educational CD-ROM that focuses on number and letter recognition and simple counting and prereading skills . Horton , that famously faithful elephant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find her mom . To do so , youngsters must help them search the Cool Pool and the Jungle of Nool , each of which contains four multileveled activities designed to familiarize kids with letters and numbers . Each of the eight lessons features a Seuss character and three levels of difficulty . Upon completing a level , a player is rewarded by a clue about Elma Sue 's mother . Unlike green eggs and ham , this software should have broad appeal . Ages 2-4 . TABLE <p> WHEN YOU LOAD BLUE 'S ABC TIME Activities you may think you 're looking at a TV screen instead of a computer screen . Humongous Entertainment 's digital rendition of Nickelodeon 's preschoolers ' series Blue 's Clues ' is , for the most part , a seamlessly crafted duplication of the popular show . Same adorable , but speechless , puppy dog ( Blue ) . Same goofy , but lovable , host ( Steve Burns ) . But Blue 's ABC takes the interactivity ' of the TV show one step further by allowing children to explore the world of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficulty as a child 's skill level rises . Kids can navigate a letter maze , complete fill-in-the-blank rhymes ( Tickety was by the tree when she lost the golden key ' ' ) and skidoo into a virtual zoo to match letter sounds to animal names . This program requires some parental guidance . Youngsters may need cues to navigate the virtual storybook  --  and some of the drag-and-drop skills required may be difficult for tiny hands . Overall , however , Blue 's ABC Activity Time accomplishes what even the most in- novative of TV programs could not . It not only offers interactivity , it puts the kids in charge . Ages 3-6 . TABLE <p> HERE 'S ONE SCHOOL your child wo n't ever want to leave . JumpStart Preschool and its companion JumpStart Kindergarten take you to a colorful classroom where friendly animal students ' like Pierre Bear and Eleanor Elephant guide kids through simple reading and counting games . Both CD-ROM programs can easily be operated by an unassisted preschooler , important for giving kids a sense of autonomy and control . A child can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objects ; blocks will tumble , books will open and toys will dance out of their box . Parents get a report card ' feature that allows them to track a child 's accomplishments skill by skill . The best part : you don ' t have to sign and return it to the virtual teacher . Ages 2-6 . TABLE <p> HUMONGOUS ENTERTAINMENT 'S Pajama Sam 2 : Thunder and Lightning Are n't So Frightening is adorable . In this adventure game designed to teach problem solving to kids ages 3 to 8 , Pajama Sam is a blue-skinned , blanket-caped child superhero . ' He discovers that the machine that controls the earth 's weather  --  the World Wide Weather factory  --  is broken . The world 's weather has gone haywire and Sam needs your child 's help ' to fix it . Kids spend the game trying to help him find the weather machines ' missing parts  --  so it will stop snowing in Saigon . Everything becomes interesting in the hands of Humongous 's animators : even when something is irrelevant to the main story , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lampposts hug each other , complimentary nuts ' say nice things , light bulbs change themselves . This is the sort of stuff kids ( and adults ) love ; it keeps them running through the game looking for the objects and information that can help them on their quest . The game even comes packaged with a hilarious comic book that gives background information about Sam 's superhero role model , Pajama Man . The game may be a bit complex for preschoolers , but primary-school students will find it fun , funny and challenging . Ages 3-8 . YOUNG KIDS TABLE <p> IS YOUR CHILD READY FOR SCHOOL ? It 's the question that can send parents of preschool children into a tizzy . But Knowledge Adventure , maker of Fisher-Price Ready for School : Kindergarten , is out to cure their angst . This program , targeted at children 4 to 6 , offers all the standard kindergarten-readiness activities plus some nice extras . Using a pretend town ' metaphor , the easy-to-install program addresses some 30 different early-learning skills ranging from shape recognition to simple logic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must count and follow directions to create their own ice-cream concoctions . In the Clock Shop , they identify numbers and learn to tell time . As they answer questions correctly , they collect their rewards in the form of virtual school supplies . At any time during the game they can change the program 's level of difficulty by clicking a button on the main screen . While Ready for School is similar to many other multisubject school-readiness programs on the market , it distinguishes itself in two areas . One unusual feature is its focus on social skills . A veritable Ms. Manners for the sandbox set , it offers lessons in sharing toys , saying thank you and exercising courtesy on the telephone . The program 's second unique feature is its abundance of delightful music  --  including some 10 original educational songs  --  a plus for children who learn best aurally . Ready for School may prove less than challenging for children with lots of preschool experience . But parents may want to buy it for reassurance ; any child who can master the skills required in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ages 4-6 . TABLE <p> WHILE THERE 'S NO WAY FOR A software program to assist your kids on specific problems like a real tutor , Microsoft 's My Personal Tutor for first and second grade can help . It does an especially good job with math-problem-solving games . The math CD , Sky 's Space Station Voyage , has a cute sci-fi action theme , fun animation and interesting , creative ways of teaching fractions and multiplication tables . Turru 's Daring Sea Quest teaches thinking skills with matching and problem-solving games and Disneyesque animals . If your child has trouble reading , he may have a tougher time with the language skills ' CD : Sam 's Hide and Seek Adventures , the main activity on the disc , revolves around a hide-and-seek game in a museum that assumes some reading knowledge  --  in some cases , more than many first graders have . If nothing else , the wacky Professor Presto , who is always in the lower right corner ready to give hints , will teach kids that asking for help is an integral part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LEARNING COMPANY 'S CLUEFINDERS is a series of educational adventure games for primary schoolers that revolve around supernatural mysteries . The 3rd Grade Adventures disc has a pre-Columbian plot , in which our heroes try to save a girl 's uncle from the evil Mathra ( read : MATH-ra ) monster . The 4th Grade Adventures title takes place in Egypt , where the ClueFinders ' professor has been kidnapped by a diabolical museum curator . In both , the educational games are well integrated with the plot , and the instructions explain to parents how the games ' language , math and problem-solving games help children . With these CD-ROMs , learning 's no mystery . Ages 7-10 . TABLE <p> TIRED OF FINDING CRAYONS AND paper spread all over the house and tracked into the carpets ? Flying Colors 2 ( Deluxe Edition ) is the no-mess solution to rainy-day blues . The drawing-and-painting program provides young artists with a variety of tools  --  paintbrushes , spray cans , pencils and the all-important eraser  --  as well as more than 3,000 predrawn stamps , ' which are clip-art images @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plain background or one of 50 elaborate backgrounds , which include land- and seascapes , interiors and even space scenes . There are also maps of the 50 states and a wide variety of appropriate symbols , making Flying Colors 2 handy for geography projects . There are four levels of difficulty , from Baby to Advanced . The Baby setting is a little weak  --  click anywhere on the screen and a random stamp appears  --  but the advanced mode is so sophisticated that parents may even find themselves using it for posters and invitations . The images can be exported or printed easily , or stored as bitmaps ( which makes posting them to a Web site a little tricky ) . One of the best features is the series of construction element ' stamps ( like bricks and bones ) , which let budding architects and biologists build everything from dream houses to dinosaurs , piece by piece . This powerful program 's a winner . Ages 8 and up . TABLE <p> DRAWING AND PAINTING PROGRAMS have come a long way . IBM and Crayola 's CD-ROM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for anyone , including the kids it was designed for . Hosted by the scruffy French painter Scribble , the program gives the artist in you or your family an enormous number of creative options : from markers to crayons to watercolor paints to animated stickers to pointillism to the manipulation of photo imagery to  --  well , you get the point . All the tools talk and make individual sounds when used ; the watercolor brush sounds like flowing water , for example . Most of the program is intuitive ( though you have to be careful clicking the various brushes because some of the tools , while cutely placed in cans , can be a little too close together on the screen ) . You can save your work , upload photos to muck with , and print ; you 'll need a color printer for the full effect . In case you ca n't think of anything to draw , there 's a large gallery of Scribble 's unfinished paintings that you can complete . . . or destroy . Ages 5-10 . TABLE <p> THIS TRIED-AND-TRUE SERIES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mumblers from the Planet Nonsense are taking all the books , and kids go in search of them with the Blasterpal rescue team . Each adventure is landscaped with exercises based on a group of similar-sounding words . For instance , Priscilla Icely  --  the snow monster  --  will help you cross the water if you help her spell log ' or frog ' ' ; in the volcano you have to try and grab the letters of the words you hear ( e.g. , clog ' ' ) without bumping into the Trollocks . Once you successfully complete a mission , you are rewarded with a clue to the identity of the deviant Mumbler . In Writing Blaster , kids sign into digital desks ' and may work on a variety of projects , from an autobiography to a haiku to a story starting with If I were invisible . ' They can illustrate these projects with a set of musical crayons , decorate them with stickers and e-mail them to friends . There are practical applications as well , such as an address book and a to-do list , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In both discs , the games and learning are so seamlessly interwoven that kids wo n't know what hit them . Ages 6-9 . TABLE <p> READER RABBIT 'S 2ND GRADE provides a welcome respite from any elementary-school monotony . The game 's star character , Reader Rabbit , is being held prisoner by a playful purple dragon . To save the day , his friend Sam the Lion has to solve reading comprehension , math and science puzzles . ( Homer employed similar plot devices . ) The technique  --  wrapping educational exercises in the guise of a traditional computer adventure game  --  is smart , and kids will enjoy themselves while putting their classroom skills to the test . In one reading-comprehension exercise , players have to read a paragraph and decide if the underlined portion is the main idea or a detail ; it 's good practice for the SAT they 'll be taking in 10 years . In one exercise , called Runway , the player has to touch some shapes , like the hexagon , while avoiding others , like squares and circles . The goal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more substantive drill is Castle Journal , in which kids must write a few lines to finish a fable . Overall it 's good fun and , with goofy animated characters like a mirror that quips It 's time for some quiet reflection , ' it recalls the Disney animated movies . Our only quibble : in one exercise called Skillway , the player is called upon to grab things that fall into a certain category , such as plural words . But the keyboard controls are clumsy , and kids might get frustrated when they grab the wrong items by mistake . Still , that 's a small drawback to an otherwise epic learning adventure . Ages 6-8 . TABLE <p> WARNING : MY FIRST AMAZING World Explorer may give kids a serious case of wanderlust . This geography guide features an interactive atlas so chock-full of information on world cultures and landmarks that ordinary maps may never look the same . The game begins in a virtual bedroom ; clicking on the world map hung on the wall launches young explorers on an entertaining trip around the globe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winning combination on the interactive map ( the centerpiece of the program ) . Click on the Taj Mahal , for example , and the fountains burst into action ; click the steppe eagle , and he does a silly march around the Central Asian plains . Highly motivated kids wo n't even need the more regimented games that guide you around World Explorer ; the information and entertainment packed into the geography , animal , city and transportation icons are reward enough in themselves . Less enthusiastic travelers can chase their cartoon buddy Joe around the earth , trying to deliver him an important package , but beware : this particular activity drags on longer than necessary and has to be repeated five times before you earn the five gold medals ' that complete the game . Other , less work-intensive rewards include stickers of animals and attractions for your sticker book , postcards that can be thumbtacked to the bulletin board in your bedroom and videos with hard-to-resist titles like Sleepy Koalas ' and Ostrich Race . ' Have a good trip ! Ages 4-9 . PRETEENS TABLE <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guise of road races through Mexico and France . The goal of the match is to identify pairs of vocabulary words and their corresponding pictures faster than your computer-controlled rivals , and thereby advance in the road race . Players make three stops at checkpoints ' that are named after real cities like Bayonne and Guanajuato . At these stops , you interact with the colorful populace and solve various puzzles . To win the race , the student holds a conversation with a character by choosing among possible sentences . And users with microphones can actually practice their pronunciation . Other software packages may cover more ground , but Kaplan 's engaging programs ensure that kids will cross the finish line . Ages 11 and up . TABLE <p> YOU MAY HAVE TO EXPLAIN TO YOUR children that the cartoon characters in Zap are a spoof of ' 70s glitter rockers , but that 's about it . They 'll be explaining the rest to you . Zap presents hard-to-grasp lessons about electrical currents , sound waves and light in a way that 's actually easy to understand . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and help musicians Blaze , Riff and Surge repair their equipment before the big concert . In the Laser Lab , use the lenses , filters , mirrors and other tools to explore how light refracts and reflects . In the SoundWave Studio , manipulate different recorded sounds to learn about amplitude , frequency and wavelength . In the ElectroLoft , by far the most fun environment , you put the principles of electric circuits to work fixing broken amps and other machines . Throughout the program , kids who 've learned the basics can switch from question and answer ' mode to explorer , ' and fool around with the different experiments to their hearts ' content . At the end of a long session in the labs comes the payoff : the Zap concert , starring you as guest conductor . Ages 8-12 . TABLE <p> SIMSAFARI GIVES ASPIRING conservationists everything they need to create and manage their own African game park . As the safari ranger , players have to balance the needs of the plants , animals and paying visitors , while maintaining good relations with local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by crisp sound and lively video snippets about the dozens of plants and animals in the park , including the all-important who eats whom . Pay close attention : too many lions and too few gazelles , for example , can spell big trouble . Life on safari is n't all sunsets and photo opportunities , however . Drought , fire and locusts can undo years of hard work . Worse , if you are n't a good neighbor , the villagers wo n't want to work in your camp , and may even resort to poaching animals . The game 's only drawback is that its miniature dramas are so compelling that busy rangers might spend all their time addressing the needs of the park and neglect other important jobs  --  like doing homework . Ages 8 and up . TABLE <p> GIRLS WHO LOVE BOOK SERIES like Sweet Valley High and the Babysitters ' Club should get a kick out of Rockett 's Adventure Maker . This program allows young wanna-be artistes to create their own comic strips using the amiable characters at fictional Whistling Pines Junior High School @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you after the easy installation process and hands over the Whistling Pines yearbook . Inside are musings of the fairly predictable characters who populate the school . Fortunately , you can design your own friends '  --  choosing from many different body , skin , hair and clothing types  --  and write their likes and dislikes into blank pages of the yearbook . From there , make changes to prefab comics by adding dialogue , props and characters , or create whole minidramas from scratch . The Adventure Maker also includes an Internet connection to www.whistling-pines.com for interactive adventures , but girls will find plenty of extracurricular activity right here in this box . Ages 8-12 . TABLE <p> WHO KNOWS WHAT DRIVES A MASTER criminal mind ? In Carmen Sandiego Math Detective , the latest title in this wonderful adventure/education series from BrOderbund , Ms. Sandiego has embarked on yet another sinister project to screw up the world . She 's stolen 12 of the world 's wonders , shrunk them and hidden them away . Foiling her evil plans means that your kid will be doing a whole lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's wonders to actual size requires using special devices that decode and analyze Carmen 's secrets . Wisely , each device has a funky , supertechnological name : does n't Microchip Decoder sound cooler than Geometry Fun ? In Atom Smasher , little Susie will be working against the clock to zap out answers to math equations . Crimewave Sensor tests her skills of estimation . Molecular Scope is about translating word problems into equations . There 's something sneaky about educational CD-ROMs that masquerade as video games . But it sure works . Ages 8-14 . TABLE <p> LET 'S FACE IT , TYPING IS ABOUT AS exciting as sitting around watching planes taxi . Is that why designers at Individual Software Inc. set Typing Instructor Deluxe at the most boring locale imaginable , an airport departure gate ? Surprisingly , the disc is consistently effective and entertaining . After the smooth installation process , would-be typists punch a words-per-minute goal into their Passport , take a quick placement test and head off to the Typing Instructor airport . The lessons ( customized to address your most common mistakes ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can skip around but Typing Instructor gently nudges you to master even keys like those miserable greater than ' and less than ' symbols , which you might prefer to avoid . After a particularly grueling lesson , Typing Instructor rewards you with a typing game from its video arcade . ' For more rote practice , wander over to the Magazine Rack to pluck out a Hemingway short story or an article on the latest spring fashions and type along as you read . This teaching disc is n't for young children , but just about anyone else  --  from rank beginners to longtime keyboard jockeys  --  will have more fun than they might have thought possible watching their words-per-minute rate climb and accuracy soar . Ages 7 and up . HIGH SCHOOLERS TABLE <p> LET 'S PUT IT THIS WAY : IF WE HAD owned the MathSoft StudyWorks ! CD-ROMs , our high-school math and science classes might not be the repressed memories they are today . The math version covers algebra to trigonometry to college-level calculus . Its science companion covers biology , physics , chemistry and geology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centers . ' The worksheet is a kind of calculator that pops up on your desktop . You can use it to automatically solve your equations , but then  --  with the click of a button  --  it also will evoke the formulas in a range of graphics . The resource center provides extensive , searchable libraries of tough concepts like the Law of Universal Gravitation . Essays , with easy-to-understand real-world examples , elucidate their meanings . Basic publishing tools then allow students to turn their calculations into decent-looking reports . These are powerful tools . Teachers might want to make sure that all their students have them . Ages 12 and up . TABLE <p> THE PRINCETON REVIEW NOW prepares 70,000 fledgling high schoolers for the SAT each year . Its success lies in this basic notion : the SAT is a game ; you just have to learn how to play it . Inside the SAT , PSAT &; ACT ' 99 Deluxe , which is based on the $795 prep course , loses nothing in the translation . You start by taking a practice test that identifies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series of drills . If you type in a wrong answer , you 'll know right away ( you 'll hear a car crash , a siren , a pitying Oooooh ' from an anonymous crowd ) , and the disc will gently explain how you made your mistakes . The deluxe edition also gives you a computerized college counselor . A competitiveness interview , ' which asks you questions about various admissions criteria like grades and extracurriculars , will yield a list of schools  --  both safeties and reaches . Most important , the hands-on , high-level interactivity of Inside the SAT makes the test seem manageable . In the stress-heavy college-admissions process , every little bit helps . Ages 10-13 . TABLE <p> FULL DISCLOSURE : NEWSWEEK AND Kaplan are both owned by The Washington Post Company . Now that that 's out of the way , the Kaplan Higher Score Guaranteed on the SAT &; ACT Deluxe is an excellent , comprehensive five-CD college-entrance test-prep extravaganza .

Thanks to BrOderbund 's Family Tree Maker Deluxe , it 's now easier than ever to find out . Family Tree 's 10 CD-set provides all the tools you need to become our own genealogist . The program starts with a forest of information : more than 170 million names , selected U.S. and international marriage records from 1340 to 1980 , a 60-year ( 1937-97 ) Social Security Death Index and five World Family Tree CDs containing information from 27,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To jump-start your search , you can check out the company 's Web site ( www.familytreemaker.com ) . There 's also a guide book that walks you painlessly through the data-entry process , using Abraham Lincoln 's family as an example . At the heart of the CD-ROM are the Family Pages , which have the warm and friendly look of an old-fashioned album . This is where you 'll do your work : from compiling notes , stories , medical facts and other information of interest , to inserting images ranging from photographs to video clips . One of the best things about Family Tree Maker is its ability to produce a professionally presented book  --  complete with title page , dedication and table of contents  --  that the relatives are sure to relish . And who knows ? Maybe Great-Great Uncle Henry will appear in those pages as a hero instead of a rogue . TABLE <p> WHERE DO YOU WANT TO GO TODAY ? Microsoft actually can answer that question with Expedia Streets Bundle ( which includes TripPlanner 98 ) , a door-to-door travel package that will get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in where you are and where you 'd like to end up , and Expedia Streets will provide a custom set of printable directions based on the fastest route or individual driving preferences , like whether you want to zoom down an interstate or seek out more scenic routes . The program also includes the Zagat Survey listing of 17,000 restaurants nationwide , and accommodation information for campgrounds , hotels , motels or B &Bs.; And you can now make reservations through Microsoft 's travel Web site , Expedia ( expedia.msn.com ) . Its intuitively designed interface , extensive maps and comprehensive listings make Expedia Streets the best in its category . TABLE <p> IF THE POINT OF A CD ENCYCLOPEDIA were just to be thorough , Encarta is not the first one you 'd buy . In sheer weight of information , nothing matches the Encyclopedia Britannica on CD . But for general family use , accessibility counts for something , too . So do design , educational tools and multimedia elements . Encarta is strong in three of the four areas . Its articles are clearly written , aimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many with nested sidebars ' offering primary-source material . The hyperlinks are well integrated into main-article texts , and take you both to other Encarta articles and Web resources ( Encarta works as well with Netscape as with Microsoft Explorer ) . The design is clean and elegant , with clear graphics and excellent zoom-in maps . Good multimedia , too , especially the animations . The thing that needs help is help : Encarta 's guide to report writing . TABLE <p> GROLIER 'S STRENGTH IS ITS authoritative text . Many articles come from leading scholars  --  Mark E. Neely Jr . on Abraham Lincoln , for example . College students will find value here , while high schoolers will not feel left behind . Some multimedia elements are high-quality : the article on the sonata form in music is accompanied by a generous audio sample of Beethoven 's Moonlight ' sonata . The design , however , is pedestrian  --  perhaps the result of a decision to allow it to display adequately at smaller size on laptop screens . Graphics and maps are only adequate . Very good feature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . TABLE <p> IN NEED OF something called Homework Wizards ' ' ? They are World Book 's distinguishing feature . There are five : guides to report writing , chart creation , time-line building , Web-page design and quiz preparation . They allow you to manipulate World Book text ( degree of difficulty : high school ) and graphics for a variety of different classroom presentations . Other tools include stickies ' for taking notes and a yellow text highlighter that looks almost like Magic Marker . Nice feature : Time Frame , which allows you to specify a year , decade or century , for which the software will then build a display of significant events and developments . TABLE <p> MINDSCAPE HAS TAKEN THE extreme step of including more than 300,000 tournament games in its formidable two-disc , chess-teaching program  --  more than the most determined drudge could absorb in a lifetime . Thankfully , Chessmaster 6000 delivers this wealth of knowledge in bite-size pieces . In one feature , an onscreen coaching box alerts players to the advantages and pitfalls of each possible move , and shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Or you can watch as Chessmaster 's built-in analyst Josh Waitzkin , the kid from Searching for Bobby Fischer , ' analyzes a grandmaster 's game  --  or one of yours . The program 's second disc contains lesssons given by renowned tutor Bruce Pandolfini . Beginners  --  in computers or chess  --  could easily get lost in all this . Chessmaster 6000 is not for kids and requires thorough study of the instruction booklet . But when it 's time to play , you 'll feel as if the assembled masters were looking over your shoulder . TABLE <p> ALL THEY WANT FOR CHRISTMAS is a . . . pet ? Do n't despair , you may be able to get a leash on the situation with this disc from P.F. Magic . Petz ' walks users through just about any aspect of having cats and dogs , whether it 's filling out adoption papers , providing them with the right amount of food and water , watching them fall in love ' or dressing them up for impromptu fashion shows and taking lots of pictures . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play in , and they can even frolic on your desktop . The creators of the program , to their credit , have fun but take their lifelike model seriously : for example , interspecies breeding is not allowed ( say , a chincilla Persian with a Chihuahua ) , and pets can not regain fertility after they are spayed or neutered . Indeed , these pets are so realistic that practically the only thing they ca n't do is shed all over your clothes and furniture . TABLE <p> WITH ONLY THREE CDS TO INSTALL  --  some comparable programs we looked at contained up to nine  --  Microsoft 's Home Publishing 99 keeps it simple . You can use this CD-ROM for the standard home-publishing fare like crafting colorful invitations , certificates , greeting cards and fliers . But it also lets you create animated greeting cards and send them via e-mail  --  which will undoubtedly make friends smile when they arrive in their electronic in-boxes . The disc 's predesigned projects get you going : start by either picking a sample or drawing your own cartoon masterpiece . Simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then add sounds : a baby cooing for your new addition , the sound of crickets chirping to celebrate a new home , or even your own swinging self personally inviting friends over for cocktails . With thousands of styles from which to choose , Mom and Dad will also find the CD-ROM handy for business cards , stationery , even brochures . Bored with Microsoft 's choices ? Download additional material from its Home Publishing Web site . Though Home Publishing 99 can be a little slow , this smart home-publishing program will fast become a favorite . TABLE <p> IDOBE 'S PHOTODELUXE IS essentially a stripped-down version of Adobe Photoshop , the premier photo-retouching program used by industry professionals . That means it 's powerful . The pull-down menus are close to what you find in Pho- toshop , with special effects , photo sizing and rotating . But Adobe has hand-tailored these tools to suit the average shutterbug . Step-by-step instructions guide users through applying special effects like adding crackling , embossing , sponging and other pretty touches to their pictures . The Adobe Web site is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example , shows you how to change hair color on photos  --  a hoot for kids and not a bad idea for Mom to test-drive a new tint before that permanent-dye job . Digital-camera enthusiasts can choose a variety of ways to get photos from camera to screen for finishing . If you graduate from PhotoDeluxe , Adobe has another program for more Web-savvy types . Created especially for Web use , ImageReady has a lot of professional functionality , but at $219 , comes at a professional price . TABLE <p> INCARTA VIRTUAL GLOBE 99 does n't just reach a level of detail no other CD-ROM atlas can match ; it 's also the best-looking and - sounding and , in many ways , the most educational . Virtual Globe lacks historical details that other CD-ROM atlases have , but makes up for the deficiency with unique touches : many different kinds of maps ( for such things as population density , environmental diversity and precipitation levels ) , essays on Global Themes ( from air pollution to the European Union ) and multimedia videos ( ocean waves to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help users find the information Microsoft does n't offer on a silver platter . The main problems with Virtual Globe have to do with the size of the program ( it can take a whopping 30 minutes to install ) and , unless you have 32 megs of RAM , it can be pretty slow . An amazing program nonetheless . TABLE <p> UNLIKE OTHER MUSIC TUTORIAL CD-ROMs that have flashy titles and useless gimmicks , Guitar Method is as straightforward as its name . Developed with help from New York City Ballet orchestra first violinist Sabina Skalar , this best-selling disc takes beginners through 60 easy-to-follow interactive lessons , supplemented by video and audio clips . Early lessons teach you about tuning and the different types of guitars , but by the end you 'll be proficient at finger-picking and syncopation . Guitar Method is sympathetic to your learning curve . You 're not at the mercy of their sequence  --  each lesson , technique and song is conveniently indexed , making it easy to skip ahead or repeat lessons . When learning a song , you can play along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , depending on your level . With practice , you 'll know all the basics and dozens of chords , leaving you ready for the next step  --  eMedia 's Guitar Method 2 . TABLE <p> IN AN INCREASINGLY CROWDED AND competitive field , Dragon NaturallySpeaking remains the best overall natural-language dictation software of its kind . All the available programs allow you to speak into an enclosed headset microphone in a normal tone of voice , and then they translate your words into written text . But while Dragon and its competitors  --  IBM ViaVoice and L &H; VoiceXpress  --  all boast more than 95 percent accuracy , Dragon is the only one that we found to surpass that goal early and often . On top of accuracy , Dragon also has a highly intuitive set of editing commands that allow you to voice-correct as you go along , and an impressive vocabulary base of 42,000 words . Like its competitors , NaturallySpeaking is a whale , requiring at least a 200 MHz Pentium processor with 64 MB of RAM . Installation 's a chore , too ; but once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never before . TABLE <p> IT 'S HARD TO BEAT A PAPER MAP . But USA 99 : Streets and Destinations , our favorite mapping program , has its virtues . The two-CD set  --  one for the eastern United States , one for the West  --  serves up detailed road and street maps for all 50 states , and lets you locate a wide variety of travel-related businesses and points of interest anywhere in the country . The detail is impressive , more than enough to help you wind your way through the most obscure suburbs . The Businesses and Attractions feature lets you pinpoint everything from restaurants to cemeteries to a gas station in , say , St. Helena , Calif . No information is given beyond name and location , but knowing that there is a gas station in St. Helena  --  three of them in fact  --  is a good start . An Internet link to the free MapQuest Web site helps you find extra information about towns and businesses you might want to visit . Now , if you could just stick it in a glove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family-friendly card-making program , holds your hand at every step of the way , prompting every move  --  whether you 're selecting a card size or design , resizing an image or changing text  --  with foolproof options listed in pop-up boxes . With the 3,500 predesigned templates , 5,000 graphics and 500 photos , it 's easy to make personalized stationery , invitations , labels , certificates and , of course , cards . The designs are by Hallmark so you can count on a mix of fun and serious selections . Or , create your own from scratch . Importing art and photos from outside sources only takes a few mouse-clicks . E-mailing multimedia messages and connecting to the Internet to find out about Hallmark 's latest add-on packs are equally seamless . Other programs may offer more complex projects and images ; but Greetings 99 is great for young kids , while more experienced users wo n't lose interest . GAMERS TABLE <p> BILLED AS THE OFFICIAL DIGITAL sequel to the feature film The Lost World : Jurassic Park , ' Trespasser strands players on an unknown island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Players take on the role of Anne : a castaway who finds herself washed ashore on the mysterious island , Site B. The goal is to get off the island , and there 's no rescue party in sight . Instead , players must solve puzzles to survive and fight off dinosaurs in a variety of terrains , including jungles , mountains , beaches , lagoons and abandoned industrial environments . What sets Trespasser apart from other first-person action games is that the game was built around a physics-based game engine . This means objects in the world look and act like things do in real life . For example , if you see a rock , you can actually lift it up and hurl it . If it lands in a pool of water , the rock will cause ripples . If you pick a flower off the ground , you can examine it from all angles . Same goes for the dinosaurs  --  except they 'll be the ones doing the picking . TABLE <p> COMMANDOS : BEHIND ENEMY LINES , set during World War II , puts players @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , each with special abilities . For example , the Green Beret can scale walls , dig himself in the ground to hide and use decoys to distract guards . The Spy can put on a German soldier 's uniform and stroll through enemy camps . The object of the game is to best utilize each of the commandos ' talents to complete the 20 in-depth missions , which take players from the parched desert of North Africa to the banks of the Rhine , the mountains of Norway to the beaches of Normandy . But completing these missions is no European vacation . In this game , it does n't take much to get killed , just three shots . And the enemy troops are canny foes . They can see and hear you . Leave a trail behind , like footprints in the snow or a dead body , and they will investigate and alert their comrades . So think ahead ; your actions have consequences . TABLE <p> IN UNREAL , YOU ARE A PRISONER aboard a spaceship en route to a penal colony . The ship crashes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is being subjugated by the cruel and technologically advanced Skaarj . You must escape and help the Nali defeat the Skaarj . Living up to expectations , the graphics in this long-awaited game are easily the best graphics of any first-person shooter to date . The colors are bright and the textures create detailed , absorbing environments . Blessedly , the game design mixes wide-open spaces and cramped hallways , unlike the usual in dungeon-crawl-type games , where monotonous scenery dulls the senses . You need to stay alert in Unreal : gameplay is like a roller-coaster ride . At times , it can be downright scary . Unreal 's feature for playing against opponents over the Internet has improved since its release in May , but it 's not perfect . However , for a single-player romp , Unreal does n't just meet expectations ; it lives up to its name . TABLE <p> BOASTING NEW skating and goalie animations and improved artificial intelligence , NHL 99 is king of the rink . Besides having all the usual features we have come to expect from EA Sports ( six gameplay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , NHL 99 comes equipped with new 1998 rules that incorporate a smaller crease and allow a video judge to overrule a referee on crease violations . All 27 NHL arenas are simulated in 3-D with impressive video flybys . Even the Nashville Predators , a brand-new expansion team , made it into the game . This attention to detail is matched with astounding graphical realism : bits of ice spray in the air when a player makes a hard stop , and just before a face-off you will see a player wipe the sweat from his face with his shoulder pad . It 's so realistic , you wo n't believe your eyes . TABLE <p> WHEN IT COMES TO 3-D action games , endless corridors and infinite rounds of ammo come to mind . That was before Half-Life . Developer Valve Software ( in partnership with Sierra Studios ) has made a first-person shooter with brains . Combining an engrossing story line with spectacular graphics , Half-Life when played is like taking part in a Hollywood motion picture . Assigned to a top-secret experiment at a decommissioned missile base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can glimpse an alternate universe . You attempt to break through to this world further by creating a power spike with a nuclear warhead . The result is disaster : demonic creatures set upon you and your co-workers . Now , you have to save your remaining colleagues , defeat cunning monsters and avoid getting killed by government cleaners ' that have been dispatched to destroy the whole mess . The game 's special animation technology builds moving characters with so many polygons , the stuff game graphics are made of , that they look real  --  even too real . And the artificial intelligence is truly brainy : characters will strike up convincing conversations with you . Pay attention ; they have information you need to survive . Believe us , you 'll want to stick around until the very end . TABLE <p> ELECTRONIC ARTS ' LATEST PC RACING simulation pushes the technological envelope , updating a top-selling classic with sizzling new touches . The best enhancement is hot pursuit ' mode : players can attempt to outrun high-performance police cars or drive a specialized patrol car themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but get an adrenaline rush chasing a speeding car with your lights and sirens going . There are even five police behavior ' options , including multiple-car pursuit , roadblocks and tire spikes as well as realistic dispatcher and cop-radio chatter . Graphically , Hot Pursuit does n't slow down either . If your PC has hardware that boosts graphics performance , the game 's real-time lighting engine has so much horsepower that roadside objects will appear as reflections in the hood of your Lamborghini as you drive along . Spectacular . TABLE <p> EVER WANTED TO KNOW WHAT IT would feel like to inhabit a Tom Clancy thriller ? Now you can , with Red Storm Entertainment 's latest action/strategy game , Rainbow Six . Based on a story concept by Tom Clancy ( who is also the company 's founder ) , Rainbow Six makes you a member of an elite antiterrorist task force whose mission is to save the planet from the global threat of terrorism . The game successfully blends intense action and extremely deep gameplay to deliver an edge-of-your-seat experience . The planning ' phase of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before embarking , players learn their main objectives and the identities of the hostage-takers and victims . Players then assemble their team of eight , chosen from 20 operatives , each of whom has special characteristics and skills . After selecting weapons , players must map out their attack using a complete floor plan of the mission area , which shows possible locations of terrorists , hostages and other key details . Your elite team will execute your instructions to the letter . Be careful , though : this is n't Quake , where you can take numerous bullets before you die . In Rainbow Six , all it takes is just one good hit and you 're history . TABLE <p> FOR YEARS THE WING COMMANDER series from Origin Systems has dominated the space-combat genre on the PC , with its elegant mix of gameplay and state-of-the-art full-motion video sequences . But this year there 's a new kid on the launching pad named Descent : FreeSpace  --  the Great War . It 's this year 's most compelling and epic space-combat simulation . The adventure starts with a plot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : you are a rookie pilot , working your way up through the ranks . The story branches in different directions depending on the decisions you make and how well you perform . But the true star of FreeSpace is the graphics . Everything visual in the game  --  textures , shading , lighting and special effects  --  is simply gorgeous . Explosions shower glittering debris , the sun flares in your peripheral vision and your missiles leave visible trails in space . To help novices get comfortable , FreeSpace has in-game training missions where players can practice the basics of flying and combat maneuvers.These are useful skills , especially when you 're ready to venture beyond the borders of your home PC and test your prowess against other players over the Internet or local-area networks . The game can support you and 11 other space jockeys at a time . You 'll want an audience for your air shows . TABLE <p> MADDEN FOOTBALL TITLES , developed with the help of its namesake , the legendary coach and TV commentator , have always been consistent winners when it comes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The game offers more than 100 past and present NFL teams , including the current 30 NFL squads and handpicked concoctions like All-Madden teams . This year 's rendition also has improved artificial intelligence that can adjust more quickly to a player 's skill level . And the graphics are noticeably improved . They 're so good that , when Madden NFL 99 is played with a 3-D accelerator , it almost looks like you 're watching a television : you can see the wrinkles in players ' jerseys and puffs of condensed breath in cold-weather games . The developers also implemented new moves such as wrap tackles , juke moves and stiff arms . The best football sim is even better than you remember . TABLE <p> REAL-TIME STRATEGY GAMES HAVE had a big impact on the computer gaming industry . Just a couple of years ago only niche audiences enjoyed the deliberative pleasures of real-time strategy games , which favor chesslike stratagems over a twitchy trigger finger . Now , almost every major game publisher has at least one real-time strategy game in its lineup . Starcraft from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new high  --  it puts players in outer space . Created by the same people who brought us the genre classic Warcraft II , Starcraft pits players in an all-out war among three races  --  the Terrans , Protoss or Zerg species . You are the commander of a race ; you are on a collision course for galactic domination , doing battle in space or inside planetary installations . With each of 30 do-or-die missions , more of the epic story of the universe unfolds . Unlike Warcraft II , where one race had the distinct advantage , in Starcraft , the developers improved the game design so all three races have their own strengths and weaknesses . It makes for intricate strategy . That , coupled with a cool music soundtrack , memorable voice-overs and ultrarealistic graphics , makes Starcraft the best in its class . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : ELMO 'S READING : PRESCHOOL &; KINDERGARTEN <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : ARTHUR 'S COMPUTER ADVENTURE <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : DR .
