I was born on the grounds of the Mount Mohonk Hospital for the Insane , where my father was Chief of Psychiatry , and because of this I grew accustomed to the sounds of misery before I went to sleep at night . I would lie in bed upstairs in my family 's house , which was situated one hundred yards from the main building , and after lights out , I would hear shrieking and weeping as though animals were being slaughtered . No , no , it was nothing like that , my father assured me , coming into the bedroom . These patients were in psychic anguish , he said , and no one was laying a hand on them . <p> Now it has been nearly fifty years since I lived there , and while the hospital still exists , its nurses now wear street clothes , the bars have been sandblasted off all its windows , and " Insane " has long been extinguished from its name . But back when I lived on the grounds of the hospital with my father and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aging groundskeeper , and those nighttime shrieks echoed through the surrounding hills , frightening the locals and waking the deer . <p> " Is anyone being beaten ? " I asked my father before bed . <p> " No one is being beaten , " he answered . <p> " Is anyone being whipped ? " <p> " No one is being whipped . " <p> " Slapped ? " <p> " No one is being slapped . " <p> " Throttled ? " <p> " Where did you learn that word ? " asked my father . And so it went , this bedtime ritual , and though many of the patients stayed up weeping and howling throughout the long night , I was able to sleep the fluent sleep of children . To the patients , this place was a hospital , a prison , but to me it was home . <p> It was my father who decided that I would become a doctor . He had read in one of his medical journals that an unprecedented number of girls were entering the field of medicine , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone needed proof a fleet of bulky young women in white coats and harlequin glasses , standing behind an autoclave . The idea of me , a seven-year-old girl who pasted pictures of iceboxes and hairstyles into scrapbooks , eventually transforming into one of these women , seemed a reach . But my mother had been told she could bear no more children . This meant that there would never be a son , so one morning my father walked into my room , sighed , then stretched the jaws of a stethoscope around my neck . For a brief moment , thinking it was jewelry , I picked up the silver disk at the bottom and held it between my fingers like a religious medal . My father tried to smile encouragingly , for this was clearly a big moment for him , a rite of passage . His stethoscope and his trays of equipment and his vast library with titles such as The Hysterical Female and Sexual Normality and Abnormality : Twelve Case Studies  --  all of this would be turned over to me at some appropriate point in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , most of the authors were long dead , as were their tormented patients . Even the publishing houses  --  with names like Pingry &; Seagrove , Burroway Bros. , Smollett and Sons  --  no longer existed . The entire world , as I knew it then , no longer existed , but seemed to have been snuffed out like some ancient star . Back when my father decided I would become a doctor , the Depression had settled in over the whole country . Nurses had been " let go , " as my father said , and I pictured packs of women in white scattering across the lawn , their fluted cupcakepaper nurses ' caps sent sailing . Week after week , families yanked seriously ill patients out of the hospital . A schizophrenic man might be shipped off to distant cousins in Iowa or Nebraska , doomed to spend his days with an American Gothic couple who had agreed , for a fee , to take in this peculiar relative who never spoke . The farm couple would stare in perplexity at their boarder and wonder what in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a thresher and put him to work ? Wrap his hands around the swollen udders of a cow ? Or just let him sit on the porch and rock ? Other patients were pulled out of the hospital and deposited on the streets of New York City , which swallowed them effortlessly . Many of these men and women drank themselves sick or froze during the long winter . <p> A small , elite population remained at Mount Mohonk throughout the Depression , and these patients were my father 's bread and butter . They were an unlikely assortment of men and women whose families had secret , inexplicable reservoirs of money , and who seemed untouched by dark times . Here was the nucleus of unassailably rich America : shrewd bankers who could afford to keep unbalanced , yammering wives confined to the mountaintop for as long as it took . And sometimes it took forever . <p> Over the years , seeing the same faces in the windows of the hospital , the same figures in soft robes lumbering down the gravel footpath , I became comforted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as those of relatives seen year after year at holiday dinners . There was Harry Beeman , a financier who had jumped from his fifteenth-floor office in the Bankers ' Equity Building , only to bounce twice on the striped tarp of the building 's awning , crushing several ribs and both legs . Now he limped through the halls of Mount Mohonk with a copy of The Financial Times in front of his face , muttering about figures as though any of it still mattered to him . There was Mildred Veil , a society matron with milky cataracts and a delusion about being Eleanor Roosevelt , which none of the nurses really minded , because it made Mildred a great help on the ward , always volunteering for some project or other . The core group of patients never grew worse , never seemed to get better , and never asked when they could leave . The world was n't going to open up for these people ; it stayed stubbornly shut , an aperture that let in no outside light . <p> The same was true , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the world , at least the world as it revealed itself through the large rosewood radio that sat in the living room . The Depression touched the edges of our lives , fraying them , certainly , but leaving everyone intact . What I did learn about the world came largely from a source that had been available to me for years , but which I had never thought to consult . One morning , when I was twelve years old , with my mother in the kitchen downstairs and my father at the hospital across the lawn , I entered my father 's study , mounted a rolling ladder that was attached to the floor-toceiling bookshelves , and brought down the copy of Sexual Normality and Abnormality : Twelve Case Studies . <p> What did I know about these matters ? All morning I sat with the book heavy in my lap , struggling to make out the tiny typeface . I sat with legs crossed , chewing a piece of hair , shocked but caught up in the tide of words and their meanings . All winter my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty-eight degrees , and I imagined that the temperature had to be kept so low or else the books might self-destruct . It was as though I were holding the original Gutenberg Bible in my hands , and that this room served as some special emergency vacuum in case of fire or apocalypse . But even if there was an apocalypse , these words would float over the wreckage of the world , so deep were they embedded in me , so deep already at twelve . <p> And all my father had done was drape a stethoscope around my neck . But somehow he had crowned me some twisted version of Miss America : Miss Toilet Mouth , Miss Disgusting Secrets , Little Miss Disgusting Secrets . I could hardly get through the week without dipping into my new fund of knowledge . Images scrolled by in pornographic frescoes , and I realized that I could have become rich in the playground of my day school , had I sold my classified information . Any single page torn from Sexual Normality and Abnormality : Twelve Case Studies would have fetched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was over five hundred pages long , my father would have never known the difference . But I could n't tear anything out of that book ; it would have been like ripping " Letters to the Romans " out of the Gutenberg Bible . Entire sections stayed in my mind , eventually memorized as thoroughly as the Pledge of Allegiance : <p> " Miss H. , " began the case study on p. 348 , " was born in a rural home in Norway to illiterate farming parents . Because she did not attend school , but instead worked the fields alongside her brothers , she had no official medical records . It was not until many years later , when she was working as a cook in the village of S  --  and was subsequently hospitalized for acute appendicitis at the regional clinic in that village , that physicians discovered the truth about Miss H. She was a rarity , a true hermaphrodite , equipped with both phallus and vagina , the former being no bigger than a pea pod , the latter equally undeveloped . The doctors at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visiting medical students to view their patient 's deformity , and she was thusly paid a wage to appear regularly at lectures at the medical college in nearby O  --  . Miss H. 's life , while spent alone , proved far more satisfying than the lives of other such individuals , many of whom attempt to join in sexual relations , and who find their advances rebuffed , often by a horrified individual who has just realized the True Nature of this creature . Sometimes , the hermaphrodite can find a peaceful home among the denizens of a carny troupe or travelling sideshow . " 1 <p> The story of Miss H. was as riveting as it was appalling ; I could imagine the woman 's wide Nordic face , and even , if I tried hard enough , her collision of sex organs . Sometimes I would forego the text entirely and just read the index , my finger skittering along the stunning list of words . Every body part was in this list , and every perverse activity ; nothing was excluded . All the shameful words from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy-bond paper , not gouged into plaster by a twelve year-old 's erratic penknife . No janitor had tried to paint over them , to refinish the surface with some virginal gloss . No , these words were actually meant to be understood . <p> So this was my future , this world where people with contorted minds and bodies coupled blindly in assorted ways . I could n't bear to believe it , yet I knew it was true . I knew it because of my parents , could see it in their eyes and their easy posture when they were together . My father was always touching my mother ; there was rarely a moment when they were in the same room and their limbs did not lightly connect . Since my mother could not conceive , what they did in their bedroom was done for the pleasure of it . They were a good fit , my father with his red mustache and rimless glasses and thick arms , my mother with her black hair swept off her neck with a silver comb . <p> They had met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ families were staying at a bungalow colony in the Catskills called Lustig 's . My father , David Weiner , was a young medical student at the time , which.gave him a certain clout . Whenever anyone approached him that summer , he would cheerfully agree to listen to a litany of complaints , to inspect what someone called , under his breath , a " suspicious " mole . In reality , he had no clinical experience yet ; at City College 's medical school , his class was still enmeshed in the fundamentals of biology and chemistry , spending afternoons drawing diagrams of the Krebs Cycle , or becoming familiar with the respiratory systems of fish . When he lifted the ribbed undershirt of a sixty-year-old man on vacation and peered at a dark brown disk the size of a quarter , he was simply using a combination of common sense and bits of knowledge he had gathered from the weekly " Ask Dr. Colin Sylvester " column in The New York Herald . But he charmed everyone , and no one was worse off for his diagnosis . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kimmell " he told a woman with parchment skin . " Get some rest , " he told a nervous young newlywed husband . All around the colony , men and women followed David Welner 's instructions , lying in the shade for naps , swigging plenty of fresh water , eating roughage . Everyone was happy , mosquitoes dotted the surface of the lake , the summer slowly unrolled . <p> Toward the end of the season , my parents became engaged . My father had been chosen to judge the bungalow colony 's annual beauty pageant . Of the twelve Brooklyn and Bronx girls who paraded along the dock , making their way across the scarred planks in their stiletto heels , my mother was the one he chose , hands down . At eighteen , Justine Fogel was tall , with a head of jet hair and high , impressive breasts . She was planning on studying voice in Manhattan in September . A neighbor knew of a vocal coach named Oskar Mennen who would instruct her once a week for a low fee . His slogan was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got one , too . " <p> But my mother never went to see Oskar Mennen . Instead , she married David Welner shortly after Labor Day , and the couple moved to a tenement apartment on Chrystie Street in Lower Manhattan . During the day , my father went to classes and my mother sat at home practicing scales ; at night they cooked a plain dinner on their stove and went to bed . Sometimes in the middle of the night , he woke up and sat in the living room studying ; she could see a tiny yellow bulb burning in the living room , and his silhouette curved in concentration under the light . <p> Slowly , my father became noticed in his classes . One day he attracted the attention of a visiting professor of psychiatry named Fox Mendelson , and over the years the two men kept up a correspondence . Later , when my father was looking for a position , Mendelson recommended him to the board of trustees at a private hospital called Mount Mohonk . The job paid poorly , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had noticed a distinct strain of anti-Semitism among psychiatrists , despite the fact that their god was a Jew himself . In the hospitals and clinics of New York City , he encountered psychiatrists with names like Warner Graves and Loren St. John , men with silver-threaded hair and deep , uninflected voices and degrees from Amherst and Harvard . What my father had going for himself was wit , dexterity , and the ability to leap from bed at four in the morning to subdue a schizophrenic who was smacking a nurse over the head with a cast-iron bedpan . He was handsome and did n't seem too ambitious , and he raised interesting points during grand rounds . At age thirty-two , he became the youngest chief psychiatrist in the brief and undistinguished history of the Mount Mohonk Hospital for the Insane . <p> He and my mother inhabited the large house across the lawn from the hospital , taking as their bedroom the room that overlooked the road out front . It was almost possible for them to lie in their four-poster and imagine that they lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like any other young couple . But at night , when the howling started , they remembered . <p> My father was a hit with the nurses and orderlies . He strode the shining halls of the hospital as though he had been running the place since birth . Even his memos were praised . ( " Re : hospital gowns . It has come to my attention that the dung-colored gowns worn by our patients are perhaps no good for morale . Might we find something with a bit more dash  --  perhaps peach or skyblue ? " ) <p> My mother fell quickly , but less gracefully , into her role as the chief psychiatrist 's wife . Before the Depression , her job largely entailed standing in the middle of her kitchen , conferring with a mute Negro hospital cook about upcoming dinner parties at the house . She would wave her pale hands vaguely , opening drawers and pointing to spoons and knives , saying , " Now , there are the spoons . Oh , and the knives . " She was hesitant in this role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her grandmother , who used to section her grapefruit for her with a serrated knife . But that was different . That was family . This was help . Help ; the word itself was so strong , something you would call out when you were drowning . Her whole life was becoming unrecognizable . <p> They were aimless , both of my parents , rolling around in this huge house together , anxious to populate the rooms with children . By the time I was born , they were ready , tired of seeing only mentally ill people , eager for an infant 's simple and understandable cry . But when the obstetrician told my mother that she could bear no more children , my father let his only daughter into his life in a way that no one , not even his wife , had been allowed . <p> Every few months he took me on a whirlwind tour of the hospital : the dining room , which smelled perennially of fried flounder , the Occupational Therapy room , where dead-eyed patients pressed images of dogs and presidents onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We breezed past doors with doctors ' names stenciled onto the grain , and past doors with signs that read WARNING : ELECTRICITY IN USE . These doors were always shut , and I longed to see what electricity looked like when it was " in use " And I also longed to see where the patients actually lived , where they showered and dressed and bathed . But the wards themselves , with their heavy doors with chicken wire laced into the glass , were off-limits . I was allowed to see hospital life only from a distance , watching as patients slogged through the halls in their dung-colored gowns and flannel robes . I often stood staring at them , and once I made prolonged eye contact with an obese man whose face was blue with stubble , until I was whisked off into the nurses ' lounge , where big band music emanated from the radio , and I was given a handful of sourballs by a trio of fussing women . And then the tour was over . <p> Although I was allowed into the hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to explore the grounds whenever I liked . With the sun sinking and the air aromatic with pine and earth and Salisbury steak , the whole place smelled like a summer camp . One day , at the rear entrance of the building , I saw delivery men unloading drums of institutional disinfectant . As they rolled them up a ramp and into the service entrance , I could read the words " Whispering Pines , " and even though the name referred to nothing more than a rancid fluid that would be swabbed across the floors and walls at dawn , it sounded like the perfect alias for the hospital , the ideal name for a splendid summer camp . <p> Whispering Pines , I whispered to myself as I stepped into the thicket that continued until the edges of the grounds , where it was held back by the iron fence . Vines flourished along that fence , wound around the spokes like a cat winding around a human leg . Just as the patients often seemed to want out , so did the vegetation . Everything grew frantically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tangible signs of the times could be found there , at the edges of the land , where nobody had bothered to prune or clip or chop away at the excess . Sometimes a group of patients would sit on Adirondack chairs on the lawn , taking in a chilly hour of sun , and sometimes a nurse would take a patient on a supervised stroll , but only along the circular path closest to the hospital , and never into the woods . The woods were mine , at least for a while . <p> The summer I turned fourteen , my father implemented a program he called " Tea at the House . " This involved inviting a promising patient to join him and my mother for afternoon tea in our living room . The patient was always someone at least a little bit appealing , someone who would n't make any sudden moves . Someone very close to health , who needed a bit of encouragement to topple him or her completely onto the other side . <p> The first person invited to Tea at the House was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had had a nervous breakdown and was unable to complete any action , even dressing herself in the morning , without dissolving into hysterical , gulping sobs . At the hospital she had made a slow but admirable recovery . She came to tea on the Friday before her husband was to bring her home , and I sat watching at the top of the stairs . Both Mrs. Allenby and my mother were lovely-looking and uncertain , like the deer that occasionally made a wrong turn in the woods and wound up stunned and confused and frightened on the hospital lawn . The women shyly traded recipes , while my father sat between them , nodding with benevolence . <p> " What you want to do is this , " Mrs. Allenby kept saying , and as she spoke she blinked rapidly , as if to remove a speck from her eye . " You take an egg and you beat it very hard in a bowl with a whisk . Then what you want to do is this ... " The living room smelled strongly of Oolong tea , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the closest thing to drinking pipe tobacco . <p> I eavesdropped on several Teas at the House over the year , and I came to understand that mental patients could be divided into two groups : those who wore their affliction outright like a bold political stance , and those who hid it so actively that that became their trademark , grinning until their teeth might splinter , wanting so badly to hold themselves together . <p> Warren Keyes was of the second variety . He was a nineteenyear-old Harvard undergraduate who had tried to kill himself in his dormitory room eight months earlier , and who was close to leaving Mount Mohonk to return to school . Over dinner , my parents discussed this boy , who would be coming to Tea at the House the following day . " He 's young , " my father said , " and good-looking , in that Harvard way . " <p> Warren Keyes registered in my mind in that moment , was locked into place even before I had met him . Here was a Harvard man . That went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a privileged upbringing , complete with long walks along the Charles River and various racquet sports . And it went over well with me , too , for even before I met Warren Keyes , I had sculpted his features and his limbs into some crude rendering of attractiveness . <p> The next afternoon at four o'clock , Warren sat in the living room gripping the fragile handle of a teacup . He had trooped across the lawn with a squat nurse , who now sat in the foyer , dully knitting like Madame Du Farge . I knew that he had been invited to the house as a reward for getting well , but casting a critical , fourteen-year-old eye on him from the top of the stairs , even I could see that he was not well . <p> " Warren plans on returning to Harvard next semester , " my father said . My mother hummed a response . " Leverett House , is n't it ? " my father went on , he who had studied at City College , yet who knew the names of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Chief of Psychiatry at Mount Mohonk and yet who was , irrevocably , a Jew . <p> " No , Adams House , " said Warren . His voice was relaxed , although his cup jitterbugged in its saucer . <p> Conversation pushed on about Harvard in general , football season , and New England weather . My mother did n't add much , and my father kept plying Warren with questions , which he politely , if wearily , answered . At the end of the hour , Warren Keyes looked exhausted . I imagined that he would go back to his hospital bed and sleep for thirty-six hours straight , regaining his strength . <p> Breaking his own tradition but questioned by no one , Dr. Weiner invited Warren Keyes back for a second Tea at the House , and then a third . On his fourth tea , he was unaccompanied by the dour-faced nurse . Instead , he made a solo flight across the lawn , his coattails floating out behind him . That afternoon , I had been strategically sitting on the porch doing my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair was sloppily bound up behind my head with elastic , and there was ink on my fingers , for I had not yet mastered the fountain pen . But even so , Warren Keyes climbed onto the porch and gave me a good hard look . Although it was not the first time I had seen Warren Keyes , it was the first time he saw me . <p> " I 'm the daughter , " I said . He nodded . " They 're inside " I told him , inclining my head toward the screen door . Deep in the house , the tea kettle shrilled . <p> " Do you like tea ? " Warren asked . It was the kind of question that my father 's colleagues often asked me when they came to dinner : well-meaning and uninteresting probings from people who had no idea of what to say to children , yet somehow , maddeningly , meant to be answered . <p> " I like it okay , " I said . <p> " Your mother makes good tea , " Warren said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I slid off the railing . " I have to go , " I said . <p> His eyes widened slightly . " Where are you going ? " he asked . <p> And for some reason , I told him . I told him where I went every afternoon ; I practically drew him a treasure map with an X. Later , I sat in the woods reading The Red Badge of Courage , and suddenly there was a parting of branches . Warren Keyes came through , stooped and stumbling in . He had in his hand a familiar folded linen napkin with scalloped edges . He squatted down beside me , this handsome , ruined Harvard sophomore , and he opened the napkin , which contained three golden circles : my mother 's Belgian butter cookies . I took them silently , and ate them just as silently , while Warren watched . <p> " So what 's it like to live here ? " he asked . <p> What it was like , I thought , was like anything else . Like going to the day school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How I wanted to ask him a similar question : What was it like to live there , inside a hospital for the insane ? What was it like to be insane ? Was it like a long and particularly vivid nightmare ? Did you know you were insane ? Did you long to crawl out of your body ? Did you actually see things  --  shapes and animals and flames dancing across the walls of your room at night ? But I could n't bring myself to ask him anything at all . Light was draining from the patch of woods , and suddenly Warren said , " May I ask you something ? " <p> " Yes , " I said . <p> " Could I maybe touch you ? " the boy asked . <p> I nodded solemnly , really believing , in that moment , that he was referring to my hand , or my arm . He wanted to touch me to see if I was real , the way , years earlier , I myself had surreptitiously touched the bloodless face of my cousin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order to have the experience of touching someone who was n't insane  --  someone who had a normal life and lived with her parents in a real house without bars on the windows . He wanted to touch me to see what I was like . <p> Warren came closer , sliding across the dirt floor to where I sat with my book . " I wo n't hurt you , " he said . <p> " I know , " I said . When his hand came down on one of my breasts , those recent arrivals , I could not have been more shocked . I did not know how to stop this , and I felt at once hurled out of my own realm and into his . " Now wait , " I said , but his hands were already moving freely above my clothes . He seemed not to have heard me . He sat in front of me , touching my breasts , my neck , my shoulders , and in fact he was n't hurting me . So what was I upset about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this thing he was doing , this casual exploration . It was his face that frightened me  --  the intense and worshipful expression on his features , as though he were kneeling and lighting candles . His mouth hung open , his eyes were focused . <p> " I 'm not hurting you , " he kept repeating . " I 'm not hurting you . " <p> And all I could answer was , " No . You 're not . " <p> I closed my eyes so I would n't have to see his face . I closed them as if to block out a strong sunlight . I felt myself grow dizzy , but I thought it would be worse if I fainted , because who knew what would happen then ? When I came to , I could never be sure of what had taken place . So I made myself stay conscious , and I felt each motion he made , the starfish movements of his fingers as they slipped beneath my blouse and headed downward . I knew the names of all the parts he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under my breath . His hands toured a living index from the back of my father 's book , and as they did , I summoned up all the words I knew . But what good did it do me to know these things , to know what they meant when I could n't even manage them ? <p> He moved against me as if in a trance , and I felt like a wall , something for others to rub against ; I was a cat-scratching post , a solid block . I felt his large hand inside my underwear , so out of place , st ) wrong . The elastic waistband with its row of rosettes was pulled taut against his knuckles . Just that morning I had chosen the underwear from a drawer , where it lay with the others , ironed , white , floral , and touched only by me and by Estella , who did our family 's laundry . No one else was meant to touch it . Warren 's hand was trapped inside it , like an animal that had run into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against its will , if that were possible , if hands had a will of their own . <p> Now one of Warren 's fingers was separating itself from the other fingers and pushing into me , sliding up into my body . I felt a shiver of pain , and then something that was n't pain at all , but surprise . I sat straight up , and started to cry . His big finger , which had held on to my mother 's teacup , which probably wore a Harvard ring sometimes , which had a flat fingernail that he trimmed in his cubicle in the hospital for the insane , if they let him have nail scissors , was deeply embedded in me , like something drilled into the ground to test for water or crude oil . Like a machine , a spike , testing the earth for vibrations or for moisture . The finger felt all these things , but I felt nothing . <p> After some endless time , Warren Keyes made a small sound like a lamb bleating or a hinge groaning open , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back onto the surface of leaves , my body returning to itself : small , flexible , a skater 's body , while Warren turned away from me , wiping his face and the front of his trousers with my mother 's napkin . <p> In a gentle , quaking voice , he told me it was better if we left the woods separately and , of course , if I told no one about what had happened . " There 's nothing to tell , anyway , " he added . " I did n't hurt you . " And it was true ; he had n't hurt me . <p> I left first , walking slowly with book in hand as though nothing had happened , like a dreamy teenaged girl leaving an afternoon of reading , but when I reached the edge of the woods , where the lawn began , I broke into a run toward the lights of my parents ' house . Inside , I walked straight up the stairs , claiming I was ill and did n't want dinner . My mother pressed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off . There would be no more touching today ; even the back of a familiar hand , prospecting for fever , was too much . <p> That night , before going to sleep , I pushed up the window by the bed and poked my head out . From the hospital across the lawn , I heard the familiar crying and baying , and without thinking , I opened my mouth and softly joined the chorus . The sound came naturally , and I hung out that window in the warm spring night , howling quietly in a low , effortless voice , as though I had been doing it since I was born , as though it was natural to my species . <p> Weeks passed , and I noticed my own shift in feeling almost as though I were charting the progress of a bruise , watching it go from black to blue to brown to yellow , until finally it was only a smudge , a small trace memory . I did n't understand whether what had happened was something that Warren Keyes had actually wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself because he was , as the name of the hospital announced , insane . Should I have felt furious , or should I have felt compassion , as my father would have ? I was lost , not knowing , and after a while it became too late to ask anyone . Time separated me from the memory , and other things rose to replace it  --  real things , much more important than a young man touching a girl in the woods of a mental hospital somewhere in the mountains of New York State . <p> Arching over everything was the war in Europe . It had come into our lives through the large rosewood cabinet that my father kept in the living room beneath a Winslow Homer print , and now during dinner parties , when the meal was through , my father and his colleagues gathered around it . The maid moved through the rooms emptying ashtrays , while the doctors ' wives sat quietly , sipping brandy and looking concerned , and the men out-shouted the broadcast with a running commentary of their own . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How much would the war in Europe affect any of us ? After all , the Depression had touched only the edges of our lives . The hospital had far fewer patients and a much smaller staff than it once had , but still it stayed intact , a neutral duchy in the middle of a rapidly dividing world . I decided that a war on another continent could not really touch anybody here , not these psychiatrists with their identical little mustaches , or these wives who sat listening to the barbershop quartet of male voices around them , or even me . For a while I was actually able to sustain this feeling ; for a while I hung suspended in it . <p> But then eventually we were in the war , too ; we , my father had said , and the word referred to some of the hospital 's staff . Dr. Rogovin , Dr. Sammler , young Dr. Herd , and several of the orderlies had all enlisted . Nurses , too , left that winter to work for the Red Cross . Whispering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night at dinner late that January , my father slipped a letter from his breast pocket . It was written on Harvard stationery . " You remember Warren Keyes , " my father said to my mother . " That Harvard boy . " When I heard this , my hand sent a butter knife involuntarily crashing against a glass . After the chime subsided , my father began to read the letter aloud : <p> Dear Dr. Weiner , <p> I hope you still remember me . You helped me a great deal not too long ago , and after leaving the hospital I returned to school where I gave my attention to Classics and found great pleasure in my work . Last year I took first prize here for my translations of Catullus . I wanted to let you know that I have enlisted in the Navy , and , despite my psychiatric record , have been accepted . Before I go overseas , i thought I should write you a short note to thank you for everything you have done . My regards to your wife . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the table while my father finished reading .
