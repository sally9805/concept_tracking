<p> Victims ' rights are ignored <p> According to the Chronicle 's Editorial Board , the proposed victims ' rights amendment would weaken our Constitution ( Editorial page , June 12 , " Victims ' rights ; Constitutional amendment would dilute protections for all " ) . <p> For the 43 million Americans who fall victim to crime each year , only to be revictimized by a criminal justice system that ignores their rights , this amendment has already come too late . <p> I dare anyone to proclaim that a defendant 's right to a lawyer , a speedy trial or due process are important , but they do n't need to be in the Constitution . <p> By amending the Constitution to guarantee victims the right to participate in our justice system , we begin to make amends for the harsh treatment which has caused so many victims to believe the criminal justice system was even more criminal when it came to protecting their rights . <p> The Constitution currently has four amendments dealing with the rights of a defendant . If a defendant is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case will be dismissed . By the same notion , if victims are not apprised of the many rights afforded them , according to the Chronicle 's Editorial Board , all they get is a shrug of the shoulder , or if they 're lucky , an apology . <p> All that victims want from the Constitution is to not be treated like common criminals . It is time now for victims to have a balanced voice and that will only happen with the passage of a constitutional amendment . <p> The only unwilling participant in the entire criminal justice system is the victim and they should be the centerpieces of the system , not on the outside , looking in . <p> If we treated defendants the way we treat victims , it would be considered cruel and unusual punishment . Victims should not only be given their due , but their due process as well . <p> As U.S. Attorney General Jane Reno has so aptly stated , " Our criminal justice system will never be truly just until victims of crime have as many rights as criminals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mayor 's Crime Victims Assistance Office in Houston <p> Foreign , free trade really unfair <p> The June 7 Outlook article by David Wakefield about trade with China was totally wrong ( " Do n't be too impatient - China 's changes significant " ) . His article was a corporate management point of view , but not an accurate , overall picture . <p> We have had foreign trade for many decades , but up until about 25 years ago , it was called fair trade . Since then , foreign trade has really been unfair trade - or , as it is called , free trade . <p> Free trade means that our government , with the help of big business , has eliminated import tariff taxes on our imports . The other countries have not eliminated import tariff taxes on our imports , and this is what makes it unfair . <p> Wakefield says trade with China has produced hundreds of thousands of jobs in the United States and brought billions of dollars into our economy . Our trade deficit with China is $ 50 billion , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This means we import $ 150 billion more than we export . How could this in any way be construed as good for the United States ? <p> The average U.S. worker is losing out under our foreign trade agreements and workers actually have lower real income now than they did 25 years ago . This is why it now takes two wage earners just to survive when it used to take only one . <p> Corporations do n't really want to export their goods and poor nations such as China do n't want to buy American products - they ca n't afford them . American corporations want to import from these poor nations in order to make big profits and take advantage of slave labor . <p> We need a strong and honest president and Congress to stop these unfair trade practices . <p> The only way to do this is to do what all of our trading partners do and what we used to do : raise the import tariff taxes back up on all imported goods to force American corporations to stop importing and start producing in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jobs for all would solve our deficit problem . <p> H.R. Roberts , Port Neches <p> Street repair everywhere <p> Street repair is going on all over the city : Houston has become a city of orange barrels . Is this a carry-over from the last administration , or is this some contractor 's welfare program ? Streets seem to be torn up for weeks at a time , with very little pattern apparent . In some cases the entire roadway is replaced with cement . For some , the repair is simply a new cover of asphalt . Other repairs involve a new layer of asphalt up the middle , leaving the sides of the street just as rough and pot-holed as before . There are long delays between stages of construction , while expensive road equipment is left parked along the street . At several sites , after the work was completed , the workers returned and tore up some of the work that had just been completed . Many of these repairs are long overdue , but why so much at one time ? <p> John Jay Douglass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brown needs to rethink his summer youth program . It is inappropriate for the city to fund a program run by religious organizations and churches - this is a total violation of the separation between church and state . A government program should be administered by a government agency only or a nonreligious organization . Even if the Brown administration says the churches can not include religious instruction in the part of the program that is funded with government money , it is impossible for an organization with the ultimate goal of promoting and proselytizing its faith to be nonbiased toward its doctrine . I believe that churches and religion are very important and that programs targeted to help young people are also beneficial to the greater good of our community . But it is important that youth programs funded with public money not be handled by religious organizations . <p> Russ Frank , Houston <p> Oil reserves are increasing <p> Nobody is smart enough to know when the production of oil will peak , including Gregg Easterbrook ( " Running on empty , " Outlook , June 14 ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been predicting the coming decline of petroleum supply since the 1860s . <p> Yet world oil reserves are 15 times greater today than when record-keeping began in 1948 . <p> Restrictions on oil drilling ( such as President Clinton 's new 10-year ban for most offshore areas ) transfer production well into the 21st century . And human ingenuity to drill faster , deeper , more precisely and at less cost has yet to show signs of what economists call " diminishing returns . " <p> If oil production peaks in our lifetimes , it will probably be for political , rather than economic reasons . <p> With virtually all of its economic and environmental barometers showing improvement as the new century approaches , petroleum does not seem to be entering old age , but rather a spry midlife . <p> The alternative-fueled vehicles that have been on the drawing boards for decades appear to need a technological Viagra , but not petroleum . <p> Robert L. Bradley Jr. , Houston <p> Old city jail still holding <p> Regarding Jo Ann Zuniga 's June 11 article , " County may opt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe that the central jail at 1301 Franklin ( only 16 years old ) , needs to be replaced at a cost of $ 70 million , or else refurbished with $ 42 million worth of heating , ventilation and air-conditioning repairs , plus a new $ 17 million locking system . <p> If Harris County officials could not get the jail right the first time , why are we to believe they can now build one with a 20- to 25-year life ? <p> These officials are not looking out for the interests of the taxpayers . <p> James F.
