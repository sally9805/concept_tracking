Late on Sunday , in the shadows of the south end zone in 3Com Park , there was a brief summit of the old San Francisco 49ers super powers . Future Hall of Fame wideout Jerry Rice was the first one in place , and he waited patiently with open arms for quarterback Steve Young to show up . A few seconds later Young , despite a pulled groin muscle , hobbled in on a bootleg from the 15-yard line with the winning score . Finally fullback William Floyd bounded in , scooping up Rice and Young in a bear hug as the trio celebrated the Niners ' 28-21 comeback win over the Cincinnati Bengals. // " I got there last , but for a few seconds it was just the three of us , " said Floyd , " The three guys who put it together for the 1994 Super Bowl win were back together again . It 's been a long time coming , but , oh man , it felt great . " // It must have indeed . Less than a year ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then a second-year back out of Florida State who had already established himself as the premier fullback in the game , tore three of the four ligaments in his right knee in a freak collision with a teammate . Floyd sat on the turf that day , his mouth agape in pain and horror at the sight of his mangled joint , desperately trying to squeeze his kneecap back into place . It 's an injury so severe that no NFL player has even attempted to come back from it . " I always knew I 'd be back , " Floyd says . " The hardest part was convincing everyone else that if it was a one-in-a-million shot to come back , I was that one guy who makes it  --  not over , but right through the mountain . " // And there he was on Sunday throwing a crushing block on his first play and , later , scampering downfield for a 24-yard reception in the second half . Right alongside him in the inspiration department was Young . Gimping so badly that at times he appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after being benched in the second quarter , to throw for 224 yards and two touchdowns and rush for a team-high 45 yards including the game-winner . Said an exuberant Floyd after the game , " It was like the old days in San Francisco again . " // Well , not exactly . // As stunning a victory as it was , this was supposed to be a pushover game that would serve as San Francisco 's 1996 coming-out party , marking as it did the first time that Young , Rice and Floyd were together again in the lineup and ready to begin their march to the Super Bowl . Instead , on their home field , the Niners needed the second-biggest comeback in team history just to beat the Bengals , and they succeeded in stirring the pot a little more on a simmering quarterback controversy that could prove disastrous in the long run . // " This was inspirational . This was 49ers football , " said Niners president Carmen Policy giddily afterward . " It was like Geronimo leading the tribe against the Long Knives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all he could think about doing was charging forward . " // Policy 's remarks , however , rang rather hollow in light of the fact that despite Sunday 's heroics , Young , the 1994 NFL Player of the Year , still may lose his job to backup Elvis Grbac . While Young sat out the three weeks preceding the Bengals game , Grbac played well , and the 49ers front office was frank in saying that Young 's days with the team were numbered . Young is 35 years old ; Grbac is 26 and can become a free agent after this season . In a situation reminiscent of how Young supplanted Joe Montana in 1991 , Policy risks losing Grbac if he does n't give him some assurance about becoming the Niners ' starting quarterback soon . // The decision to start an obviously limping Young muddled the picture even more . His first six plays went like this : a false start , an interception , a sack , a fumble and a pair of rushes that moved the ball 36 inches  --  the wrong way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Grbac was sent in to replace Young . He promptly drove the 49ers 60 yards in seven plays , hitting backup tight end Ted Popson over the middle for a 17-yard touchdown to cut the Bengals ' lead to 21-7 . But on San Francisco 's last first-half possession Grbac injured his left shoulder rushing for a first down , and the 49ers had no choice but to go back to Young . // Coach George Seifert , still feeling the heat from criticism that he was too conservative in a 23-20 overtime loss at Green Bay on the previous Monday , opened his halftime speech by hurling a chair across the locker room . " Let me put it this way , " said Seifert , after getting his 100th win in only his 132nd game on Sunday , the best mark of any coach in NFL history . " Knute Rockne never said some of the things I said at halftime . O.K. ? " Just before taking the field for the third quarter , Floyd approached Seifert , telling him , " I 'm the spark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you know it . Put me in. " // Floyd played the entire second half . And on the Niners ' opening drive Young connected with Popson for a 39-yard score to put the 49ers within seven . Then with 2:08 left , another backup , rookie wideout Terrell Owens , raced under a perfect rainbow pass from Young for a 45-yard touchdown to tie the game at 21 . Young may be old and barely able to walk , but his arm is as good as ever . " How do you stop Young ? " Bengals defensive end Artie Smith said after the game . " Cut his legs off . And you might want to take his arms too . " // Young 's and Floyd 's performances , along with Seifert 's little chat , seemed to wake up the Niners ' sleepwalking defense . After spotting Cincinnati those three early touchdowns , San Francisco 's D forced eight straight punts . With less than two minutes to go , 49ers free safety Dedrick Dodge picked off a Jeff Blake pass to set up Seifert 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bootleg , and the subsequent celebration that grew to include Popson on one side and Owens on top with Floyd supporting the entire cast with his bionic knee . // " This team is beginning to arrive , " said Floyd . " And let me tell you , if Green Bay is the best the NFL has to offer , then we will be Super Bowl champs this year . But one win means nothing . When we win the Super Bowl , that 's when I 'll say I 'm truly back . " // Those are bold words for the Niners , who have n't beaten a team with more than two wins yet this season , but in Floyd they have proof that nothing 's impossible .
