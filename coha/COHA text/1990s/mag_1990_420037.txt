Fiction A Bangkok thief is hired to steal the perfect living doll <p> Our rendezvous , the Cafe Gung-Ho : he iridescent in the one shaft of light to breach its happy hour shade , and I , seeing that beauty for the first time , poised in the doorway , thinking , Fatal , oh so fatal . The bar was deserted , save Harry , a few girls ( humans , no gynoids ; Harry is a purist ) , and the radiant one  --  tall , blond , and cobra-eyed . Breathless , I stepped into the light . Dressed like a man , I tried to walk like a man . But I was restive ; I wanted to flirt . My alter ego , imprisoned by day within this safe-house of masculinity , rattled the bars of her cage and sulked . <p> " Kuhn Harry , I sorry , " I said in my best Charlie Chan , " Zipper not tell me you want . I come straight here . " We assumed our roles . I played the all-purpose Oriental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far from home , unsure of yourself , you could confess your appetites and trust your money . <p> " Yeah . Do n't worry about it . Lord Chandos here do n't want to hear about Zipper . " I had abandoned myself to Milord 's bodice-ripping eyes . Harry , who was acquainted with my schoolgirl crushes , briskly continued , " Let 's talk business , " and ordered drinks . I made the wad , sat down ; a Mekong appeared before me . <p> " Lord Chandos wants to take a girl back to London . " The boss paused for sales-pitch effect . " A dtook-gah-dtah . " Of course . Why else was I here ? Milord wanted a windup toy , a doll , I stole them ; Harry fenced them . Our customer  --  despite the insistence of his beauty  --  was just another farang exhausted by human love , one whose lack of credit had led him east to seek the services of a rustler . But what beauty it was : a beauty from the land of ice and snow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Dtook-gah-dtah ? " I said . " No problem . My specialty . What kind of girls you like , sir ? " <p> " Bad girls , " he said , deadpan . " And call me James . " <p> " Yes , Mr. James . Cartier ? Rolex ? Tiffany ? All fake , of course . All imitation . But very good quality . Very reasonable price . " <p> " Harry tells me half a million gets me Cartier . " <p> " You have good taste . Cartier doll very nice . Very Deco . Very bad . But doll have no right , no civil status . You need passport or you never get her out of country . " <p> " Passport 's my department , " said Harry . " It 'll need a visa , too . I do both for two hundred thousand baht . " <p> The Englishman sighed . " I 'm no longer a wealthy man , Harry . " Sweet farang , I could believe it . You seemed one of those ruined European aristocrats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the toys to which they had become addicted but could no longer afford . Automata were the playthings of the rich ; but here in sex city ( where the boys are so pretty ) , city of angels , dolls , and of night , we fake everything  --  TVs , software , designer jeans , life . <p> " In all world , " I said , " you can not get better price . And anyone tell you , Mr. James , Thai lady dolls number one . " <p> " We 're putting ourselves at considerable risk . Apart from the trouble of lifting a doll , the Eurobunnies  --  sorry , James  --  are down on us for copyright infringement . Someone out there has killed three doll rustlers this month alone . " Our customer looked uncertain , and Harry proceeded with the hard sell . " Mosquito 's just amazing . He 'll get you a Cartier doll , no sweat . He can pass through the pornocracies  --  Patphong , Nana , Cowboy , Suriwong  --  like a ghost through walls . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stranger , inhaling languorously on his cigarette , " amazing . " He looked askance , ready to snare my reaction , adding , with studied disinterest , " What 's the secret ? " Against my will , ravished , a sad , sad slave to lust , I smiled conspiratorially . Harry saw ( he knows my little ways ) and drummed his fingers on the table . <p> " Secret is seven hundred thousand baht . Half of it up front . Secret is no one knows outside this room . Secret is letting us do our job with no questions asked . Then you get your dtook-gah-dtah and everyone 's happy . " <p> Milord swept back his golden hair . " Seven hundred thousand baht , " he reflected . " I 'll have to think it over . " Harry 's lips did n't move , but his face screamed , Time waster ! The stranger pushed aside his glass and rose . " I 've some things to do .... Nice bar you have here . " Harry picked up a copy of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You know where you can find me .... " <p> " And good to meet you , Mosquito . " His right hand was gloved , concealing , perhaps , a prosthesis . Teasingly he squeezed my arm . It was an intimation of fellowship , of understanding . " Mosquito : Why do they call you that ? " <p> " Just a name , " I said , " a silly name . " <p> And then he was gone . <p> When he had touched me , I had felt a pinprick in my arm like a discharge of static . I lifted my shirtsleeve and recognized the telltale mark  --  like that of an insect bite  --  left by an epidermic tracer . <p> " What 's wrong ? " said Harry . <p> " Mosquito bite Mosquito , " I said , scratching . Harry burrowed into his paper . A nasty unidentified virus simply called klong fever was ravaging Bangkok . It was said to be transmitted by insect bites , only affect males , and leave its victims impotent . But since no farang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concern . <p> The tracer could be removed with tweezers ; but its itch , counterpointing that which I felt in my loins , made me reluctant to destroy it . I wanted him ; and he , it seemed , wanted me . Did I ask myself why ? No , my darlings . Mosquito has an extravagant heart . Closing my eyes , I beheld the blazing lines of Mr. James dancing across my retina , like the afterimage of a fierce summer 's day your aching eyes have forestalled on . I saw him , incandescent among dark London streets , a lean man dressed in light , window-shopping for automata . His cold eyes appraise their wonderful , jeweled forms as he walks down Piccadilly and into Bond Street . And there , in a Cartier showroom , he sees me and falls hopelessly in love . <p> I heard Harry throw aside his paper , the scrape of his chair . " Make hoochie-coochie with a customer again , " he said , " and I 'll break your arms . " <p> That 's Harry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I prepared for work . Seiko mechanettes ( they of the regenerative maidenhead ) had recently been decanted for bars in the Silom Road , and Harry wanted a report . On the heat-ruptured surface of my dresser I placed my creams , paints , and powders , my unguents and emollients ; then , laying out my she-clothes , I sloughed off my daytime skin and became The Doll . My alias winked at me from the other side of the mirror . She has a delicate , childlike face , my sister , with vestiges of puppy fat about the cheeks . Bobbed hair gives her an appearance of delinquency , as do the eyes , crescent and puckish , burning like black suns . The lips are set in a pout , communicating both desire and disdain . And the complexion  --  the faultless , lacquered flesh of the gynoid  --  proclaims her synthetic . Her sartorial ensemble ? A leopard-print body stocking and six-inch stilettos . The genitals , of course ( always a problem ) , have to be secured with Scotch tape , giving the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checking my fangs . Perfect . <p> I lay on the bed and browsed through some physical culture magazines while the radio murmured of love lost and found to the indifferent whqup wbap , wbop of the fan . The microscopic transmitter throbbed , caterwauling across the city to Milord . I pressed it to my lips . Instantly the imperative of that evening 's work was subverted by a premonition that he would call , not tomorrow , not next week , but tonight . And I preened myself , again and again , jittery as a girl preparing for her first date . My deceptions were unrivaled , if incomplete . Harry , who had paid for my implants and other , more radical surgery , had insisted I retain a flow of testosterone in my veins . Only a man could imitate a doll . Women were too real . For dolls are not women ; they are man 's dream of women . Made in man 's image , they are an extension of his sex , female impersonators built to confirm his prejudices . Sexual illusionists. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , my womanhood as unreal and as pathologically exquisite as a doll 's . So exquisite , it was almost grotesque . <p> The intercom buzzed . " Someone to see you , Madame , " said Zip . " A Mr.  --  " But Zip was given no time to complete the formalities . Instead of " James " ( my heart lurched , telling me it was so ) came the announcement of electromagnetic crackle and bar-brawl sound effects . I rolled off the bed , nauseous with anticipation . The hallway stank of roasted Bakelite . Mr. James had been unnecessarily heavy-handed ; Zip was a valet , not a security guard ( though his cosmetic musculature and barrel chest often led people to conclude otherwise ) . I breathed deeply , trying to remember my lines , quell my stage fright , ignore the anxious clickety-clack of my high heels on the teakwood parquetry . I made my entrance . <p> Milord stood over a broken coffee table , silk jacket ripped , Panama askew , his leather-gloved prosthesis smoking ; and Zip , horizontal amid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head , looked up at him dead-eyed with a demeanor as hard and vulnerable as the Mapplethorpe portraits that lined my walls . Hands on hips , lips quivering like a spoilt , refractory child 's , I cued in : " You want kill me , too ? " His eyes grazed my body like the feather-light tips of rapiers . It was a good body , I reassured myself , an expensive body , a body I always regretted having to camouflage by day . Exaggeratedly feminine , it was grafted onto a smallboned , somewhat adolescent infrastructure , like a piquant allegory of innocence burdened by desire . <p> " You very naughty , Mr. James . Just look at poor Zipper ! " <p> " Mosquito ? " I curtsied in acknowledgment . " Good God , I 've seen lots of he-shes in Bangkok and some of them were fantastic ... but you .... Seems you might be worth all this trouble . " <p> " I think Trouble your middle name Mr. James . " <p> " Sorry about Man Friday . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Running in an hour . " He straightened his hat and fumbled in his pockets . " Chocolates ? Flowers ? " I asked , mock expectant . <p> " Seem to have lost my cigarettes . " I bent down , retrieving a silver cigarette case lying beneath a scree of broken glass . I helped myself . <p> " Light me . " Like a tiny , nervous dragon , a Dupont flickered and withdrew . " Nice lighter . " <p> " Nice workmanship , " he said , screwing a monocle into his eye , awarding me a detailed examination . " Unreal . " <p> " Unreal as a doll . Unreal as love ... " <p> " And cool . I 'm impressed . " <p> " Tracer . Stung me in Gung-Ho . I know you come . I not stupid . " <p> " I do n't believe you are , dear boy , or you would never have allowed me to find you . " <p> Curiosity , Mr. James . <p> " Desperation , I 'd guess . Oh , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his back to me , stepping over Zipper and walking to the window to stare down at the night-transfigured city thirty floors below . " Are n't you tired of working for that American pimp ? Is he the one who tells you to speak and act like some second-rate Suzie Wong ? " <p> I let fall a tear , not altogether crocodile , but prompted more by the exigencies of coquetry than by genuine sorrow or regret . It was wasted . He did not deign to look me in the face . <p> " Harry likes me to talk that way , " I said , throwing off my Third World guise . " Says it reassures the clients . What exactly do you know about me , James ? " <p> " Everything , little Mosquito .... " A bluegray nimbus of spent nicotine was forming above his head , like the signature of a prosecuting angel . " How would you describe your childhood ? " <p> " Idyllic . " He laughed . <p> " Spoilt little rich boy . Your father a big name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gilded . " <p> " But oh so soon tarnished ! You studied at Cambridge , yes ? " <p> " I was happy there .... " <p> " I 'm an Oxford man myself . Anyway , you took a postgrad in comparative literature . Your thesis : ' The Second Decadence : Literature of the 1990 's . ' Then you got into that scrape with Lord Dagenham 's son . And he only fourteen . How wicked . Your father ordered you back to Thailand . Cut you off without a satang . Poor Mosquito , it 's been downhill ever since .... " <p> " How do you know all this ? And why tell me ? " <p> " Because I 'm feeling philanthropic , dear boy . How much money do you get from the American ? " <p> " Not enough to leave him . This apartment 's his . He keeps nearly all the money from our jobs . Even Zipper 's on loan . My father 's made it impossible for me to get a decent job .... " <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The next job it 'll be just you and me . And this time you 'll take enough of the percentage to enable you to shake Harry off for good . " <p> " So much ? " <p> " I need my doll , Mosquito . My Cartier doll . And I need her tonight . Passport , visa  --  I have my contacts for that . But I must have her before morning . " <p> " Do you need your doll so bad , James ? " <p> " Name your price . " He about-faced ; I held his reptilian stare . There had been other Englishmen . Some quite pretty . None had offered me escape . But I had known that one would come who would be special , who I would recognize by his incomparable beauty , who would , at last , carry me off to his castle in the sky . My prince . <p> " I do n't want money , James , " I said tremulously , " I want to go back to the land of ice and snow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to England . " In petulance he swung open the plate-glass doors and stepped onto the veranda . The tropical night crashed into the room . I followed him outside . <p> " Dear boy , what sort of foolishness is this ? " <p> " The first time I saw you ... " I began , but he cut me short . <p> " Please  --  let 's not make this complicated . Mosquito , you do n't want to go to Europe . " He waved his hand over the roofs of Bangkok . " Look out there . You think Europe can compete with this ? " <p> Below us the city glistened like a well-oiled body , rippling under the stars . It offered forbidden technologies , flaunted stolen ideas . It mocked the impotent West . Europe had sickened , its economy in misrule . An empire of style , it had surrendered manufacturing to the Pacific Rim and the Americas , investing instead in the refinement of those luxury goods coveted by the Information Revolution 's arrivistes : jewels and perfumes , elegancies of cloth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ automata . But with the passing of the aube du millenaire , Europe 's fashion masters were confronted by a world increasingly fickle , increasingly philistine . Japanese disinvestment prompted recession , and from the Atlantic to the Urals the continent was eclipsed by foreign vulgarizations of its genius . <p> James was very still . I rested my head on his shoulder . Like so many of his kind , he 'd come to ask the sweat-shops of Bangkok to provide consolation for his lost toys . Outside , tattooed upon towers of glass and jade , vast holograms of Buddha recalled the transitoriness of all things . <p> " I can do it , James . " <p> " I used to have a collection . Even as a child , " he said , in childlike reverie . " Being without them these last few years ... " And those cold , gray eyes softened . " It 's been hard , " he said , " hard . " His flesh was hard . I felt its panel-beaten contours through the cool silk of his Italian suit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He arched an eyebrow , his face hectic with the effort , it seemed , to at once express irony , contempt , and desire . " So little Mosquito wants to be my R and R ? " <p> " I want  --  I want to be your doll . " I pulled his head down and found his lips . " Please , " I said , " I want to be part of your collection .... " <p> " Cartier ? Tonight ? " he mumbled . <p> " Yes , " I answered , " anything . " And not unreluctantly , he allowed me to kiss him . In time I was sure I could make him love me . <p> A tuk-tuk sped me along the Sukumvit Road . Before leaving I 'd thrown on a skirt  --  just long enough to conceal the bifurcation of my thighs  --  and put in my green , luminous contacts : trademark of a Cartier doll . I had arranged to meet James later at the Honey Hotel , where I 'd present him with my catch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soi Asoke I hailed a long-tailed boat , the klongs having reclaimed much of the city , making it once more the Venice of the East . The taxi churned the dark waters of Sukumvit , scattering the reflected images of pagodas and shopping malls that sat like peroxide lilies on a black pond stained white by the city 's glare . The traffic thickened , and before me rose Nana , a gigantic lily pad , pale and bright , a night bloom releasing its bouquet of sex into the smog-filled air . Above , an insect susurration : Autogyros , caught like moths in searchlights panning the sky , were falling to earth in swarms , unloading cargoes of sweet-toothed breeders eager for Nana 's delights . I paid my ferryman and alighted . <p> Nana was doll city , very gynoidal , very het . It still possessed some of the shantytown ambience of sixty years ago , when it had soothed the nightmares of American Gls ; but now superimposed upon its skyline of poured concrete and twentieth-century slum were undulating whiplash curves and geometric lines copied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the aube du millenaire . This stylistic heterogeneity was exemplified in the person of Nana 's mammasan , Madame Kito . Kito , the daughter of a farang and a doll , belonged to that caste of half humans we called bijouterie : hybrid jewels as distinguished from all precious joaillerie . Ostracized by humans and automata alike , bijouterie lived as pariahs , envying and hating those whose holistic integrity so rebuked them . Whenever I came to Nana , Kito 's lonely , jealous , violent heart called to mine . <p> I moved through a confluence of dolls . A few repros were at work  --  ball jointed , porcelain-skinned " antiques " who offered their brass umbilical keys to passersby  --  as well as a handful of aboriginals  --  nonreflective pieces of walking , talking Al , who , like Zipper , were from a time before nanotechnology replaced microelectronics . In one doorway a matching pair of crystal torsos  --  Lalique ?  --  displayed , like deep-sea tropical fish , neural networks of polychromatic liquids . ( The opposite , of course , of most configurations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft on the outside , hard within . ) But enough of Nana 's denizens approximated my own design for me to cruise the doll-saturated streets in anonymity . <p> Walking with a gynoid 's sexual precision , I checked off each bar name , seeking my prey . There was House of Dolls , Tin Lizzie , Columbine 's , Club Puberty , and an S-M parlor , Judy 's . Some crew-cut boys eating at a noodle stall called out , " Where you going , pretty sex doll ? " and " Over here , clockwork poo-ying . " Ahead , the bar I sought signaled its wares via a sign featuring neon-green eyes , beneath which , in Gothic script , flickered WILLY HOFMANNSTHAL 'S DOLL KELLER . Willy was a Cartier aficionado . <p> In the acid noon of the Keller 's light show , amber-skinned dolls with incongruous jade-green eyes performed , in bamboo cages above my head , their generic dance , The Lordosis . Many of these girls were state-of-the-art Cartier : poo-ying mee-ow ( or , in European nomenclature , Felis femella @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sported whiskers , tails , and pointy ears or else were leopard-spotted or striped like tigresses . Compared to them my reshaped lines were passe . But Willy 's dolls seemed unconcerned . They were too busy lifting beer glasses to the lips of their farangs and prattling their babyish subtongue , their programs  --  inspired by an aesthetic of cuteness  --  stage-managing their mimes of little-girl adoration . I found the number one girl and told her I had a message from Madame for Mr. Willy . I was led upstairs . He was an old man , sitting on the bare boards of a room naked but for a rice-paper screen . On his knees was a laptop . The green spectral light of its VDU had him mesmerized . I coughed ; his head turned with a rheumatic scrunch , and while his watery eyes focused on my loveliness , the powder blue visage of a cat peeped inquisitively from the folds of his dressing gown . He stroked its head . " Ah , Gudrun , one of your sisters has come to call . What can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Madame Kito want doll . She have friend come stay . Yakuza . " The pornocracies guarded their dolls well ( when renting a doll , a farang was required to leave his passport with the bar as surety ) ; but in the six months I had doll-rustled no one had called my bluff . Willy would be an easy sting . <p> " Kito , Kito . Always Kito , " he sighed . " It is n't fair , is it , Gudrun ? " The cat jumped from its silken enclave to bathe in the laptop 's green effulgence . " It all used to be so different . But home is so far , far away .... Do you remember what it was like , Gudrun ? This doll here  --  competent workmanship , but a quasihuman structure like the rest . Unredeemed carbon ! Now , I remember real Cartier dolls : joaillerie whose insides gleamed with jewels and ivory , platinum , and gold . But Thai protein engineers have no skill with ribosomes or RNA . No skill with catalytic antibodies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know about it , then pin it all together with polymers and steel . They do not understand the alchemy of the flesh ! In Europe , Gudrun , we build atom by atom , nanocomputers controlling molecular tools to make gears , motors levers , little molecular-sized components that have the same kind of structure as metals and stones , ceramics and resins , each one programmed to replicate itself , to take its place in the divine clockwork .... " <p> His spine had become upright , and his body spasmed , as if galvanized by an unseen puppet master . Long , skeletal fingers tapped the keyboard , and as from a magic lamp , a hologram materialized above us , glowing like ectoplasm in the darkened room . It was a cutaway diagram of a gynoid , its flesh stripped away to reveal its brazen ingenuities . Slowly it began to revolve . " Tabitha . My kleinkunst . In whose arms do you lie now ? Oh , Gudrun , she was so very beautiful . Look ! What architecture ! What supernatural clockwork ! Peerless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the acetabulum of chrysoprase , mother-of-pearl , and vermeil . The bloodstones of the abdominal aorta . She was an angel , Miss Cat , a living jewel . Genitalia ? Oh , no ! Not like these imitations made today , just sex , sex , sex . She was an angel .... " He passed a hand across his face . " All the money , Gudrun , that our science gave us , spent on status symbols : arts and objets and toys . Now we farangs have forgotten how to make anything except toys , and nobody wants to buy them , Gudrun , nobody wants to buy . " The hologram continued to revolve , like a ride in a deserted fairgrounds . <p> " Madame Kito ... " I ventured . <p> " Yes , Miss Cat , I know , I know . A doll for Madame . Take one . They took my doll a long time ago . My Tabitha . My Tabs . They can not harm me anymore . " <p> Through the streets we walked , two cat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Nana . I had chosen one of Willy 's more conservative models ; Felis femella is difficult to smuggle . I looked at my companion . Why did James want her ? A biochip-and-steel , glycerin-hulled fake ? Her scent was cheap . Her makeup overdone . How could her sexual obviousness , her sensationalism , console him for the loss of a genuine Cartier doll ? Still the European sons came to Bangkok , their taste either hopelessly corrupted or forfeit to an overweening desire to again possess a mechanical love , however nonpareil . Back in London , tiring of his new mistress , it would be I who Milord would turn to for consolation . And in me he would find a real doll . <p> Soon a water taxi was speeding us through the night 's swelter and toward the Honey , where Milord awaited delivery of his dtook-gah-dtah . <p> " Cute , " he said , after he had had her perform a few party pieces and tricks , " but not a spiritual toy . Not like ... " <p> " Like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told her , and she stretched out on the bed and closed her eyes . The room , brothelscaped in red and gold , was giddy with mirrors . A poster of one of the latest automaton starlets hung from a flocked wall , her flesh transposed to the glossy world of a photomechanical : a 2-D limbo as deathlessly precious as the world of a pressed flower . The poster , like the TV that covered half the ceiling , was interactive and ran jeux verites software . Milord stroked his doll 's overextended thighs , as smooth and glistening as yellow wax . " She 'll do . For my purposes . " The photomechanical was sniggering at me . I could n't see the joke . The airconditioning was broken , the room hot and airless , and I needed a drink . <p> " When do we leave , James ? " <p> " Little Mosquito , " he said tenderly . His leather-sheathed hand reached out to offer a caress . I tilted my head , closed my eyes , and saw us , together , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thumb clasped my temples . <p> " Are you pleased with me ? " London melted in a blue-white flash , and darkness , cold and impassioned , slapped me to the floor , tied me up , stood back to watch me twitch and convulse , then embraced me , like a repentant lover . When I came to , Milord was pouring himself a scotch from the minibar , his smoking claw plucking ice from a thermos . <p> " Sorry about the ECT , dear boy , but I fear this really is the only way to ' say good-bye . ' Do n't try to get up . Your vertical hold 's rather wonky . " <p> I knew I had lost . I would always lose . Because I 'm not the real thing . Because I 'm not even a poor fake . Just a fake of a fake . Not even bijouterie . <p> How I longed for genuineness .... <p> The photomechanical , startled by the commotion , had stepped out of frame ; now she peeped round the borders of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death . <p> I just wanted to be your doll , Mr. James , just wanted to be part of your collection . But no time for self-pity . He loves me , he loves me not . So it goes . He was just like the rest , only prettier . Smile . Keep him talking . This psycho was maneuvering for the coup de grace . Delay . <p> " You were supposed to take me with you . " My lips were as numb as my arms and legs . <p> " What a revolting idea . " <p> " Then let me go . There 's no need for this . I wo n't tell .... " <p> " Oh ? And you seemed to have such a crush on me . Truly , I was flattered .... " <p> " I 'm not worth it . I 'm just a romantic fool . Why are you doing this ?

" <p> " Mosquito , you do n't understand anything " He sat astride me , a playground lout , the copper electrodes held tauntingly before my eyes , like creepy-crawlies he might at any moment put down my blouse . Reflected in his monocle I saw a green-eyed little fool , my sister , her red-lipped mouth agape in a comic-book cliche of " pain and surprise . " Milord was enjoying himself . He was a nasty boy . <p> " People seem to prefer the secondrate . Copies . Imitations . We thought at first President Kennedy would help .

And now we have nothing left . But that will change , Mosquito . I am , if you like , part of the vanguard of quality control . A recruit to the guerrilla army of taste . I buy dolls for the house of Cartier . Counterfeit dolls . And in Paris , Mosquito , they change them . Thai dolls are n't like their Western originals . Nanoengineers here use fetal tissue as a template . A dtook-gah-dtah is , in many respects , remarkably human . We have , after all , the evidence of bijouterie .

It 's prejudiced against certain kinks in your DNA : the gene , for instance , that gives you those pretty , slitty eyes ! " He forked his fingers and made to gouge me . I flinched ; he relaxed his threat . " The virus only commandeers cells displaying those idiosyncrasies that characterize your poor , overconfident race . Then the pogrom begins .

His voluminous clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen a doll enter , a man leave . After they had found the body , they would ponder how a Cartier doll had come to murder her client ; they would open her up , look for faults , scratch their heads , destroy her ; they would forget about the ill-dressed man . <p> In the small hours , above the GungHo in Harry 's private rooms , I changed into some spare he-clothes and sprawled out on the sofa while the boss quizzed me about those new Seiko dolls I was supposed to have checked out . I lied fantastically . I was in no mood to talk of mad farang scientists and their poisonous girls . <p> " That Englishman , " he said , after we had finished a bottle of Mekong . " Hear from him again ? " <p> " No . " I flushed , but the shadows hid me . It was not shame , of course , but embarrassment . I had been such an idiot . <p> " Good . Why is it always Englishmen with you , Mosquito ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tired . Tired of this ridiculous body , this extravagant heart . A fly droned lazily in the torpid confines of the lounge ; moonlight was seeping through the blinds . I remembered another moonlit world , the land of ice and snow where , once , I had been happy . Even in the last days of empire , it was a land of masques and bergomasques , of enchantment , of moonlight calm , sad , and beautiful . Life then was a long fete galante , a fairy tale . I had wanted to be part of that marvelous world , that land of satisfied desire , part of its genuineness . More than a woman , I had wanted to be joaillrie . They were not like their Eastern sisters , but elegant courtesans with the most ethereal of manners , the beloved mistresses of lords , the trusted confidantes of ladies . <p> I sometimes think I shall never return . <p> " I 'm through with Englishmen , " I said . It was doll world , not they , that I had been enamored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an impostor ; my life , a banal porno flick , a cheap jeu verite . But sometimes , half awake , half asleep , I dream that I have put off this unwieldy flesh , that , more than a woman , I have become a doll . A real doll , beloved of princes and kings . <p> " My funny valentine , " laughed Harry . " We 'll have another customer tomorrow . Another Englishman , perhaps . Go . Go home . Go home to Zipper . Go on , before I break your arms . Go home to bed . " And I did . But the dream , unreal as love , persists . <p> PHOTOS ( COLOR ) : Mosquitos <p> BY RICHARD CALDER <p>
