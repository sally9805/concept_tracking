MasterCraft ' s versatile new MariStar 225 runabout combines top quality , gl-eat performance and lots of amenities . IB ) POLLY ) HITT FLL Photograph Photograph // MasterCraft has long dominated the competition ski-boat arena , where it has racked up numerous world records while earning a reputation for excellence and innovation-both of which are reflected in the sleek new MariStar 225 V-drive Recreational Skier ( VRS ) , one of several new ' 98 models marking the company 's 30th anniversary . What 's more , this open-bow family runabout with its versatility , spacious interior and generous amenities , in addition to great performance and skiability , also marks MasterCraft 's entry into the mainstream sportboat market . The 225 's inboard V-drive configuration , with the engine aft ( vs. the all-out ski boats ' direct-drive configuration with mid-cockpit motor box ) allows for a roomier , more open cockpit while still offering the benefits of inboard power . The 225 I checked out on scenic Tellico Lake at the builder 's Vonore , Tenn. , headquarters was powered by an optional 340-hp 5.7L @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inboard , noted for offering superior reliability , performance , handling ease and fuel economy , as well as low maintenance . With its high-tech engine , drive and hull , which features a deep-V entry , modified-V midsection and flatter aft surface , the 225 's performance and handling were indeed impressive . Time-to-plane was just two to three seconds with virtually no bow-rise , and acceleration was fast and smooth through a cruising speed of 35 mph at 3200 rpm to a lively top end of 52 mph at 4900 rpm . The boat 's handling , with no need for trimming the drive , was sports-car-like . Steering response was immediate and the turning radius tight , with the boat holding steady in sharp turns , and tracking was straight . When we sliced through wake chop , the ride was smooth and stable . It was also dry , as well as extremely quiet , and the low , even wake was skier-friendly . The boat also maintained a near-level running attitude-which made visibility excellent through the wraparound , walk-through windshield . The ergonomic , adjustable swivel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side-mounted Morse competition throttle control are well-positioned . The easy-to-read gauges on the nonglare dash with elegant wood-grain panel include an electronic competition speedo and tach/engine hour meter . The Kenwood stereo controls are just below . The big , padded cockpit 's wraparound seating includes an aft-facing companion lounge adjoining an aft U-lounge , while the deep bow area has twin forward-facing lounges . The wide two-person transom sunpad/hatch lifts electrically for access to the roomy engine compartment , aft of which is a removable teak swim platform . There 's a wealth of storage , including a locking glove box , a ski locker , several under-seat compartments and a built-in cooler . The 225 features MasterCraft 's hightech , high-quality , ultra-durable LifeMaster all-fiberglass construction , incorporating Coremat plus premium resins and gelcoats . Highlights include : steel-reinforced molds ; an integral Monocoque foam-injected fiberglass stringer system laminated into the hull ; a fiberglass floor liner bonded to the hull and stringers with GlassLok and inlaid with AnchorLok steel mounting plates ( for the engine , etc. ) ; aluminum floorboards covering the drive train ; and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boat also features the MasterCraft Oscillation Dampening System and the SilentMaster muffler/exhaust system , which reduce noise and vibration significantly . With the MariStar 225 , as with all its boats , MasterCraft definitely goes the extra mile . // MasterCraft MariStar 225 VRS // <p>
