<p> Sixteen years ago tomorrow , North Vietnamese tanks rolled into Saigon , ending a struggling democracy and handing the U.S. its most complete international humiliation . It is painful to recall how many Americans welcomed South Vietnam 's fall , believing the Communists ' war effort was driven more by a desire for national unification than by totalitarian ideology . <p> Those who accepted such assurances from Hanoi 's leaders had some justification . After all , " independence and freedom " had been Ho Chi Minh 's slogan . The Communist negotiators in Paris had shared a Nobel Peace Prize for the 1973 accords , which specified that " the South Vietnamese people 's right to self-determination is sacred , inalienable , and shall be respected . " They said that " the South Vietnamese people shall decide themselves the political future of South Vietnam through genuinely free and democratic elections under international supervision . " <p> The results of North Vietnam 's conquest were , of course , markedly different . The Communists sent almost the entire young leadership of the South into re-education camps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a decade and more , only to return as virtual non-citizens . Even their children still suffer discrimination ; according to the International League for Human Rights , one in three South Vietnamese is categorized as " compromised because of family ties . " <p> The Communist Government aligned itself closely with the Soviets and gave them their first warm-water naval bases in the Pacific . It developed a disastrous state-run economy that allowed no individual initiative and made Vietnam one of the world 's poorest nations . <p> Internally , it continues to preach hatred toward the U.S. and those who fought alongside us . One need only visit the former residence of President Nguyen Van Thieu  --  now an " exhibition house " of U.S. " war crimes "  --  to see how vitriolic the propaganda remains . <p> These failed policies have caused unprecedented criticism from within the party , which is struggling to find new solutions to the nation 's problems . Respected voices such as that of the now-exiled Bui Tin , an army colonel and deputy editor of the party daily , and Nguyen Khac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to embrace democratic freedoms or face , as Mr. Vien put it , " the last chance of the party to continue its leading role . " He said that " otherwise , nothing can prevent its degeneration . " <p> In response to the criticism and to reduced Soviet aid , Hanoi permitted economic liberalization , which has stirred the beginnings of rejuvenation , particularly in the south . But Hanoi has also intensified the repression of political dissenters . The International League for Human Rights reports that a wave of arrests that began a year ago has grown into the largest such campaign since 1975 . <p> Nguyen Dan Que , a prominent physician arrested last June , has spent 10 of the last 12 years imprisoned without charges for leading a nonviolent democracy movement like those in Eastern Europe . When Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska repeatedly asked to see him while visiting Vietnam this month , he was coolly rebuffed by the chairman of the Council of Ministries , Do Muoi , and Interior Minister Mai Chi Tho . I was with Senator Kerrey , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Dr. Que was " recently arrested , " that he was still " undergoing interrogation " and that it would be inappropriate for him to be visited from " the outside . " <p> That this decision came directly from the Interior Minister indicates how tightly even nonviolent dissent is controlled . In other areas of national life , Hanoi officially proclaims equal treatment of its citizens , but officials implementing Government policy , carrying hatreds from the war , seem to practice de facto apartheid : Those who served the former South Vietnamese Government and their families are denied employment , education and medical benefits . <p> Bui Tin , frustrated with the lack of movement toward democracy , says the leaders " do n't need good advice  --  they need psychiatric help . " He says , " They are . . . there for self-interest and not the common good . " But Washington has not pressed this issue ; instead , it has focused on Vietnam 's external affairs rather than on demanding better treatment for those who fought alongside us . <p> For example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be earmarked for much-needed prosthetic aid for amputees in the south , it received no guarantees that former South Vietnamese soldiers will get such help . <p> Richard H. Solomon , Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs , announced earlier this month that the normalization of U.S.-Vietnam relations could begin as soon as Hanoi met two conditions  --  that it help end the Cambodian civil war and that it invigorate the effort to resolve the issue of Americans still missing in action . <p> While both conditions are important , neither is relevant to the reasons we severed relations in the first place . Nor will they help those who fought at our side ; Hanoi considers its treatment of those " compromised because of family ties " an internal matter and has not put it on the table . But the plight of those suffering because of loyalty to the U.S. is not a matter our negotiators should waive . We simply can not turn a blind eye to past commitments . <p> The restoration of relations with Vietnam involves complex emotional , diplomatic and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We have never before abandoned an ally on the battlefield  --  an ally , incidentally , whose casualty rate was 40 times ours  --  and not returned . It would be ironic if we normalized relations as a reward for Vietnam 's support of free elections in Cambodia while not addressing the need for democracy  --  and full equality  --  in Vietnam itself . <p> This is not to say normalization should not occur . There are sound humanitarian and economic reasons to become involved in Vietnam again . Moreover , Vietnam 's loosening of economic restrictions has U.S. business worried that other countries will make irreversible inroads . <p> Japan is exploiting the economic liberalization . Last year , 2,000 Japanese Chamber of Commerce members visited Vietnam , and 15,000 are expected this year . France , Singapore and Australia were visibly represented during my trip to Ho Chi Minh City , which is beginning to radiate a hopeful vibrancy after the years of war and internecine retaliation . <p> But unless an agreement that allows U.S. investment to flow freely into Vietnam also guarantees that the benefits flow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ families  --  that agreement would be viewed as little more than capitalist greed , a prop for the regime and reinforcement of the shame felt by those who supported us . <p> Vietnam is the great unfinished morality play of our time . The main issue the renewal of relations poses is whether we can sort through past errors while not forgetting the sincere intentions of our failed effort to preserve South Vietnam from Communism . The coming months offer Americans , no matter what their position on the war , a chance to show respect for those whom we abandoned under fire , keeping the faith when we did not . And many have paid grievously behind a wall of silence whose terrors are only now beginning to be fully unveiled . @x , seeing that my mother was already expecting her first child . <p> A young woman scarcely had time to weave the fragile fabric of her dreams in our town . All too soon the hazy faces and soft mouths of imagined lovers were replaced by hard , real ones . Neelam married Davinder Mahal when she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hasty affair that left all involved a bit breathless and stunned as she exited the front door carrying the last of her bags . In the days following the wedding , my mother roamed the house with a light , buoyant step , as one who is certain of victory . <p> I hurried off the school bus into a full , slanted wind one fall afternoon , months after Neelam 's wedding , the sycamore leaves tossing around me like many brown hands . I was attending Oak Grove High School , and afternoons , I would return home to a living room where my mother , sister , and aunts sat like fleshy fixtures drinking tea . Inside the house , the air felt stiff and dry . Aunt Teji , my uncle Avtar 's wife and the eldest among us , greeted me when I entered the living room and tapped the sofa seat next to her lightly with an open hand before pushing her smudged glasses back on her nose . I settled back beside her , taking in the sandalwood scent of her wool shawl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my aunt Manjit , who perched at the edge of her chair in her erect and ever-alert way . <p> " If it worked once , why should n't it again ? " my mother said , casually flicking crumbs from her kameez . Her voice had a slightly ragged edge to it , and I recognized that , with my presence , the conversation had shifted into what I called " code talk "  --  matters urgent and unavoidable that required immediate discussion . For I had learned that the women who surrounded me did far more than drink tea on these balmy afternoons ; they gave shape to fortune and destiny . I looked from face to face for clues . Neelam turned toward the wall in one long sweep of her lashes and a streak of crimson rose along the side of her neck . <p> " There 's an ointment that can be rubbed into the feet each night . Santi was telling me , " Aunt Manjit said . She had a closet shelf stuffed with ointments and ingredients for salves  --  tattered paper bags @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ajuwan seeds  --  the woody scent mixing with that of shoe leather from the scuffed collection of boots and sneakers piled on the floor . She was my mother 's younger sister and they were perhaps as different from each other as Neelam and I. Only twenty-eight , her body had n't softened and spread after three children , but had sharpened into the pointed , bony angles of her chin , shoulders , and hips , a body turning in on itself . <p> " I think the young bride and groom can handle these matters on their own . " Aunt Teji shifted her soft , pliant weight on the sofa and playfully slapped Neelam 's thigh . Neelam , who had thus far displayed no emotion other than visible agony , stirred and languidly peeled herself from the sofa back , sitting upright . <p> My brother , Prem , burst into the room with a basketball hooked under one arm and , without any greeting , plunged a dusty hand into the platter of pakoras . <p> " As many as you like , son , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deepa , too . " She handed him the entire platter . Deepa was Aunt Teji 's son . The two boys attended junior high together , and for a seemingly endless stretch of their lives , they likened themselves to twin Indian Kareem Abdul-Jabbars , despite their delayed growth spurts . <p> Neelam rose , collected teacups , and disappeared into the kitchen . The door creaked as it swung shut behind her . I wanted to follow her in , but I remained helplessly sunk into the soft cushions next to Aunt Teji . The sofa rose and fell with Aunt Teji 's momentous sigh , and the others joined in a round of sighing and silent assessing . A fly buzzed and skittered against the window . <p> " It 's all in the Lord 's hands anyway , " Aunt Manjit said . She flung her bony elbows in the air for emphasis . How could something that a moment ago was to be assuaged with an ointment now be in the Lord 's hands ? I wondered . <p> " Jeeto , put on another pot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my mother motioned me toward the kitchen , from where I heard Neelam running the water and the clinking of cups . There was something she wished to say to the others , something dark and secretive , I was certain , that required my absence . I will miss it , I thought as I plunged past the kitchen door . I 'd been unable to decipher entirely the discussion to this point . I knew it had something to do with Neelam , that after eight months of marriage , she had yet to announce any news of an imminent child . <p> Eight months of marriage had not healed her heart , but perhaps steeled it in some other way . I had lain awake myself those weeks before the wedding , listening to her broken , troubled sleep . Neelam had married so suddenly , married a boy she did n't know , but whom someone  --  Charan Kaur , apparently  --  had deemed appropriate . She 'd abandoned her plans for secretarial school , and I had watched it all happen , though I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mostly heard my mother 's muffled and pleading voice . Neelam had confided little in me , but suffered in a silent , stoic way . Not that there was anything dreadful about her husband , Davinder , who liked to call himself David , since he 'd now lived in the States awhile . Marriage had already softened him a bit about the edges , and around Neelam he could n't resist the sighing and simpering . Neelam had inherited the best of my parents physically  --  my father 's wide almond eyes , which registered the barest flicker of emotion , my mother 's sumptuous curves . One could n't say that Davinder was inattentive . But before him , I knew , there had been Hari . <p> In the kitchen , I filled a pot with cold bubbling water from the tap to brew a fresh pot of tea for the women . Neelam 's hands were immersed in the basin of soapy water and her arms appeared as though they had been lopped off at the wrists . Her thick blue-black braid hung forward over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ More tea ? Are n't they ready to leave yet ? " She spoke as though this were still her home , that after the others left , she would remain with us , where she belonged . Though Neelam still visited the house nearly daily after her wedding , I missed her constant presence , the slow sway of her shoulders and hips ahead of me in the hallway as I would try to bolt past . She possessed an inherent grace that had bloomed at an early age , that brought approving nods and smiles from the older women and , I had noticed , not a few men . Prem missed her , too . She had been motherly to him , fussing over him , plying him with treats and favors , shielding him with her body if need be when things got rough and heated between him and me . <p> I cracked the kitchen door open a few inches and peered out at the ladies . Aunt Teji sprawled against the back of the sofa , her eyes shut and her chest heaving with each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said , dashing Neelam 's hopes that the afternoon 's gathering might soon break up . No one dared to wake Aunt Teji whenever she fell asleep , until she 'd had a fitful nap replete with gruff snorts and odd mutterings . <p> Neelam rolled her eyes and shook the cups under the steaming stream of water . She vigorously dried them with a white cotton towel and set them on the counter . The sleeve of her kameez slipped off one shoulder , exposing the shell-shaped birthmark that kissed her collarbone . " How 's driver 's ed going ? " <p> " Well , I know what it feels like to hit a curb at five miles an hour . Parallel parking . " I added milk to the tea and turned down the flame . " I do n't know . Mr. Ronin keeps his eyes shut most of the time when I 'm driving . " <p> " He did that with me , too . He must know we 're Mrs. Rai 's daughters , " Neelam said , laughing . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mom did n't have to drive us around anymore . " <p> I nodded , though I was still regular prey to my mother 's herky-jerky , foot-on-the-pedal method of getting across town . She had practically opened a driving school for newly arrived Indian women at one point , toting the three of us along for perilous , bumpy rides crammed in backseats with other children . <p> " Jeet . " Neelam pronounced it in two slow , urgent syllables : Jee-eet . She was looking down , nervously stroking her braid as if it were an appendage , an arm with plump , dark flesh . When she lifted her eyes to me , my breath must have stopped momentarily . I knew what she was about to say , and dreaded hearing the words . " You 're still checking the mail every day yourself ? " <p> I nodded , feeling my blood slow within me . I knew of whom she spoke . <p> " But nothing comes for me ? You 'd tell me first , would n't you ? " <p> " Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that 's all . " <p> Her chin trembled faintly . I 'd yet to experience that kind of love . All last semester , Joey Kaminsky and I had exchanged long , burning glances in the back of the classroom in U.S. Government , but then I had seen him the final week of school behind the crab apples planted against the wall of the gym , his mouth hovering around Cynthia Wold 's neck . The memory felt dim and paltry as I stared into Neelam 's warm , glistening eyes . <p> She gripped the edge of the sink with both hands and gazed out the window . A row of red , blue , and purple smoked-glass dishes , earned for our mother in fervent coin tosses at the county fair , lined the deep windowsill . Outside , the gnarled fruit trees stood like old men tired of stretching their limbs . In winter , with their leaves long fallen and matted copper and rust against the muddy ground , you could just make out Aunt Teji 's house through the dense crisscross of branches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get in touch with you here . Do you know where he is now ? " I asked . The thrill of these secrets . uttered through my body . <p> Neelam shook her head . " Do n't mention it to anyone . I wanted to ask you before , but it seemed ridiculous , in a way . I guess it still does . " <p> My mother burst through the door with all the finesse of an invading army tank . " How long does it take to brew a pot of tea ? You 're standing around while the ladies are waiting . " Her face turned from mine to Neelam 's . <p> " Just sisters talking , " Neelam said . <p> " Look , you 've cooked it too long . " My mother pulled the pot off the burner . The tea had boiled away to half its original volume . <p> " Aunt Teji was sleeping anyway , " I protested . <p> " Well , she 's wide-awake and quite thirsty . Neelam , bring out more sweets . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the topic of old Mrs. Sidhu , a favorite of hers . " Did you see what she wore to the Soba wedding ? That orchid pink ? You 'd think she was trying to steal the groom . " <p> " So the poor old thing wants to turn a few heads . There 's plenty of lonely widowers to take notice , " Aunt Teji said , waving a hand . My mother wore a poorly feigned expression of disapproval . <p> The air hung like sticky , thick molasses in the room . I tapped the tip of my sandal repeatedly against the worn wooden leg of the coffee table , earning another stern look from my mother . Such toe tapping was considered a brazen , wanton gesture for a woman , and all my life my mother had sought ways to keep my restless legs still . As the women finally rose to depart , Aunt Manjit sneezed  --  twice . Everyone retreated to the sofas again for the customary half hour it would take for bad luck to charitably exit our house hold . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left quietly , nudging me to indicate that we would talk more tomorrow . Aunt Teji and I set off down the dirt road that cut through to the other side of the property . The door on my father 's shop was padlocked , as he was away making deliveries for the afternoon . My cousin Deepa followed behind us or scurried ahead , climbing a branch and hopping down every so often . The late-afternoon light had a way of flattering everything at that time of day . Aunt Teji 's face looked blushed and radiant in the bronze light , and I could clearly imagine her as the vigorous and willful young woman who had come from India many years ago as Uncle Avtar 's bride . Even now , her carriage was strong and erect , and I had trouble at times keeping up with her on these walks , stopping to linger over things as I often did . I rolled up my pant legs and slipped the sandals off my feet , letting my toes curl into the dust . It sifted like fine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one color , so that my legs looked like golden stems rising from the ground . <p> We approached the big white house , a patchwork of extensions and add-ons constructed as the Rai family grew . Aunt Teji often invited me in , though my father did n't like me spending much time there , since he and Uncle Avtar for years now had spoken to each other only at weddings and funerals ( and the women found they could tolerate their stubbornness , since such events came around often enough ) . When I did go in , Aunt Teji would stop in the shaded yard and provide detailed updates on the menagerie of plants that were like quarrelsome family to her  --  the . g tree that overproduced each year , attracting swarms of blackbirds , the weak roses that never saw enough sun . The Algerian ivy was overtaking the lawn by the front door . Behind the garage stood the goat pen , where Uncle Avtar spent a good deal of his spare time . A small corrugated-metal shed that he generously called his office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spare , with a concrete pad for a floor . In its center , a shiny black Smith Corona typewriter sat on the old scarred wooden table I 'd watched him butcher goats on , though as far as I knew , he could n't tell an a from an e , for he 'd never learned to read or write . A white family had once owned the land and the house , and I imagined it must 've looked quite different  --  tidy and tamed , not the hodgepodge of life Aunt Teji had accumulated around her even as she strived for some order . Uncle 's blue Ford pickup truck pulled into the gravel driveway , and I stopped where I was , just short of the once-prolific bed of cilantro that Aunt Teji was about to tell me had gone to seed and was dying out . She disappeared into the house without so much as a wave to her husband . <p> My uncle hopped out of the cab . " Jeeto , " he called to me , waving with his fedora in his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trampling the sycamore leaves scattered in his wake . " Come help me feed the goats , " he said , half-teasing . " You used to like that when you were a little girl . " He wiped his brow , which was gleaming with perspiration , with his denim shirtsleeve . His hair , once his hat had been removed , lay sweaty and . at over his head ; the occasional gray flecks in the day 's growth of beard glinted against his dark skin . He smiled , the soft lines around his mouth and eyes in sudden relief as he squinted into the sun . When I looked at him this way , I could still imagine the young man he had once been . His face was as familiar to me as my father 's . <p> " I 'm sorry , Chacha . I ca n't today . I 've got to get back . " <p> He nodded , understanding in his own way how things were . <p> My mother must 've waited that night , watched for the crack of light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She rarely interrupted as I did schoolwork , yet she made certain that I would n't get to it until well after dinner , after the dishes were washed , dried , and put away . In this way , my education became a source of tension , a wall between us . If I wished to distance myself from her , I would merely recite theorems from my geometry book , or comment on the Louisiana Purchase , and she would grow silent . " Hoshaar , smart , " she would say to the others , referring to me . I had to believe a thread of pride existed somewhere in that statement , just as there can be a vein of silver in stone , although it takes he smashing to find it . My education frightened her , for she knew one day it would take me away from her . <p> " Jeeto , " she called to me , pushing the door open . Her long , wavy hair , loosened from its dignified bun , cascaded well past her shoulders . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as though it were Neelam coming to bed when we shared our room . <p> I sat up cross-legged on the bed and flipped on a light . She wandered into the room and inspected a page in my geometry book , which lay open on my desk . <p> " We 're learning the Pythagorean theorem , how to find the lengths on the sides of a triangle . " <p> " Acha , " she replied , " okay , " as if she had gotten the essence of it . At such times , she would nonchalantly leaf through a book , and I 'd see a wonder seep through her , a guarded amazement that there was a system , a body of logic beyond her gods and goddesses . This from a woman who had lived in the States nearly twenty years now , whose husband was a heavy-equipment mechanic . She smoothed my cotton blankets and rested one hip at the edge of the bed . The lamp on the nightstand cast a bright arc of light over her green kameez and the pink covers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a shadow . " So what were you and Neelam talking about today ? " she asked casually . <p> " Nothing , really . She might go shopping in Berkeley on Saturday . Can I go with her ? " " With all the clothes she has ? She has n't even worn every outfit once yet . " <p> I shrugged . " She has those empty closets to fill in that new house . " Neelam and Davinder had bought a house in a subdivision on the west end of town called Stonebrook Heights , though as far as I could tell , its elevation was no different from the dull flatness of the rest of Oak Grove . <p> " Now that I think of it , you could use something for the festival . But I wo n't pay the prices in Berkeley . I 'll have Balwant Kaur make you another one . " <p> I sat forward , resting my chin in my palm and picking at the loose weave of the blanket with my other hand . " She 'll make something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants me to look ugly on purpose . Last time , I had to wear that beige thing with huge light blue roses . I felt like I was walking around in someone 's awful curtains . " <p> She took my arm and patted it . " When you marry , you can have nice things to wear , like Neelam . " I did n't want to look at her then , though she watched carefully for some positive reaction from me . " If Neelam 's going anyway , you can go along , " she continued . " Davinder 's going , too , is n't he ? " <p> " I do n't know . " <p> " Well , they had some beautiful chunis at Sardar 's . You can pick up one or two for me , " she said , though she owned veils of every color imaginable . <p> Later in the dark and quiet , I could hear a faint humming in the walls of the house . A branch on the walnut tree outside my window creaked against the eaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was shedding its oily leaves and hard , wrinkled nuts . I could imagine Neelam lying in the bed against the other wall , in the grip of a fevered slumber . As I settled back into my pillow , I felt my pulse roaring into its cushiony fibers , and I knew that Iwould lie to her again . <p> Excerpted from Under the Lemon Trees by Bhira Backhaus <p> Copyright 2009 by Bhira Backhaus <p> Published in March 2009 by St.Martin                     @x I was looking for a stranger . <p> The Fishtank was n't my usual hangout , though I 'd been inside it once or twice . Recently redecorated , it sought to compete with a bunch of brand-new bars and restaurants that had opened in downtown Harrisburg , but though the tropical theme and aquariums were pretty and the drinks cheap enough , the Fishtank was too far away from restaurant row to really compete . What it did have that the other , newer bars did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " where you hook ' em , " was sort of a joke with the young and single crowd of central Pennsylvania . Or at least with me , and I was young . And blessedly , purposefully , single . <p> Scanning the crowd , I wove my way through the closely set tables toward the bar . The Fishtank was filled , literally , with people I did n't know . One would be the perfect stranger , emphasis on perfect . <p> So far , I had n't seen him , but there was still time . I took a seat at the bar . My black skirt rode up a little and my stockings , held up by a garter belt of wispy lace , slipped on the leather stool . The sensation whispered up my thighs , bare above the tops of my stockings . My panties , of even wispier lace , rubbed me as I shifted . <p> " Tregs Pale Ale , " I told the bartender , who passed me a bottle with a nod . <p> Compared to many of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My black skirt was cut fashionably just above the knee , my blouse silky and formfitting , but in the sea of low-riding jeans and navel-baring T-shirts , spaghetti straps and hooker heels , I stood out . Just the way I wanted . <p> I sipped my beer and looked around . Who would it be ? Who would take me upstairs tonight ? How long would I have to wait ? <p> Apparently , not long . The seat next to mine had been empty when I sat , but now a man took it . Unfortunately , it was the wrong man . A stranger , yes , but not the one I was waiting for . The guy had blond hair and a gap between his two front teeth . Cute , but definitely not what I wanted . Also unfortunately , he did n't seem to take a hint . <p> " No , thanks , " I said when he offered to buy me a drink . " I 'm waiting for my boyfriend . " <p> " You 're not waiting for your boyfriend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're just saying that . Let me buy you a drink . " <p> " I have one already . " I gave him points for persistence , but I was n't here to go home with a frat boy who thought " not " jokes were the height of humor . <p> " Okay , I 'll leave you alone . " Pause . " NOT ! " <p> He laughed , slapping a thigh . " C'm on . Let me buy you a drink . " <p> " I  --  " <p> " Are you hitting on my date ? " <p> Frat Boy and I turned , and both our jaws dropped . I 'm pretty sure we each had different reasons . His was probably surprise at being wrong . Mine was in delight . <p> The man standing next to me had the dark hair and blue eyes I 'd been looking for . The earring . The jeans , deliciously worn in all the right places and the white T-shirt with a leather jacket over it . I was seated on a high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guessed him to be at least four inches over six feet , if not more . <p> Very , very nice . <p> My stranger flicked his hand like he was brushing away Frat Boy . " G'wan , now . Go . " <p> Frat Boy , to give him credit , did n't try to make excuses . He just grinned and got off the stool . " Sorry , man . You ca n't blame me for trying , can you ? " <p> My stranger turned to look at me , and his blue-eyed gaze roamed over my every inch before he answered . " No . " He sounded considering . " I do n't guess I can . " <p> My stranger took the vacated seat . He held out the hand not gripping the glass of dark beer . " Hi . I 'm Sam . Do n't say Sam I am , or I 'll toss you back to that doofus . " <p> Sam . The name suited him . Before he gave it I might 've imagined him as anyone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobody else . <p> " Grace . " I shook his proffered hand . " Nice to meet you . " <p> " What are you drinking , Grace ? " <p> I lifted my bottle . " Tregs Pale Ale . " <p> " How is that ? " <p> I sipped . " Pale . " <p> Sam held up his glass . " I 've got Guinness . It 's not pale . Let me buy you one . " <p> " I have n't finished the one I have , " I said , but with the smile I had n't given Frat Boy . <p> Sam leaned in . " C'm on , Grace . It 'll put hair on your chest . " <p> " Uh-huh . Do I look like I want hair on my chest ? " <p> Sam blatantly eyed the front of my blouse . " Without seeing the chest in question , I 'm afraid I ca n't say . " <p> I laughed . " Riiiight . Try again . " <p> Sam gestured to the bartender and asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For when you 're done with that one . " <p> I did n't take the second bottle . " I ca n't , really . I 'm on call . " <p> " Are you a doctor ? " Sam tipped back the last of his beer from his glass and pulled a bottle toward him . <p> " No . " <p> He paused , waiting for me to say more , but I did n't . He drank , swallowed . He gave the sort of manly grunt and lip-smack guys make when they drink beer from bottles and are trying to impress women . I watched him without speaking and sipped from my own bottle , wondering how he meant to do this . I really hoped he 'd make it convincing enough for me to go upstairs with him . <p> " So . You 're not here to drink , then ? " Sam eyed me , then turned on his stool so our knees touched . <p> I smiled at the touch of challenge in his tone . " Not really . No . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking . He was very good . " So what you 're saying is , let 's say a guy , oh , bought you a drink . " <p> " Okay . " <p> " Before he knew you were n't here to drink . " <p> I smiled again , holding back a laugh . " Sure . Let 's say that . " <p> Sam swiveled on his stool to fix me with an intense gaze . " Would he already have fucked up too bad , or would you give him a chance to make it up to you ? " <p> I pushed the bottle he 'd bought me toward him . " I guess that would depend . " <p> Sam 's slow grin was a heat-seeking missile sent straight between my thighs . " On what ? " <p> " On if he was cute or not . " <p> Slowly he turned to show off his profile , then to the other side until he finally looked at me head-on . " How 's this ? " <p> I looked him over . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spiked on the crown , feathered a bit over his ears and against the back of his neck . His jeans had rubbed to white in interesting places . He wore black , scuffed boots I had n't noticed before . I looked back up to his face and the quirking mouth , the nose saved from being too sharp only by the way the rest of his features came together . He had brows like dark wings , arched high over the center of his eyes and tapering to nothing at the outside corners . <p> " Yes . " I leaned closer . " You 're cute enough . " <p> Sam rapped the top of the bar with his knuckles and wa-hooed . The noise turned heads , but he did n't notice . Or he pretended not to . " Damn . My mama was right . I am purty . " <p> He was n't , really . Attractive , but not pretty . Still , I could n't help laughing . He was n't what I 'd been expecting , but was n't that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waste any time . <p> " You 're very pretty , " Sam , beer finished in record time , leaned to murmur in the vicinity of my ear . <p> His lips tickled the sensitive skin of my neck just below my lobe . Already primed by the fantasy , my body reacted at once . My nipples pushed against the lace of my bra and outlined themselves in the silk of my shirt . My clit pulsed , and I squeezed my thighs together . <p> I leaned close to him , too . He smelled a little like beer , a little like soap . A whole lot like yum . I wanted to lick him . " Thanks . " <p> We each sat back on our stools . Smiling . I crossed my legs and watched his gaze follow the hem of my skirt as it rose to give him a glimpse of bare thigh . His eyes widened in satisfactory appreciation . His tongue slid along his bottom lip , leaving it glistening . <p> He looked into my eyes . " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a guy she just met , even if he is cute as all hell ? " <p> " Actually , " I told him , matching his low , breathy tone , " I think I might be . " <p> Sam paid the bill and left a tip big enough to make the bartender grin . Then he took my hand to help me down from the stool , holding me steady when my foot came down wrong as though he 'd known all along I 'd stumble . Even in four-inch heels I had to tilt my head way back to look into his face . <p> " Thank you , " I said . <p> " What can I say ? " Sam replied . " I 'm a gentleman . " <p> He stood head and shoulders over most of the crowd , which had grown considerably since I came in , and he led me without faltering through the maze of tables and bodies toward the door to the lobby . <p> Nobody could have known we 'd just met . That we were strangers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nobody could know that , but I did , and my heart thumped hard and harder the closer we got to the elevator . <p> The walls inside reflected us both , our faces blurred by the dim lighting and the abstract pattern of gold in the mirrors . His T-shirt had rucked up out of his jeans . I could n't look away from his belt buckle or the hint of bare skin just above it . When I looked up again to meet his gaze in the mirror , Sam 's smile had shifted . <p> I saw him put his hand on the back of my neck before I felt his touch . The mirror had created that distance , that second of delay . Like watching a movie or TV , but somehow that small disconnect made this seem all the more real . <p> At the door to his room Sam took his hand away from the back of my neck to dig in his pockets for the key card . He tried both front pockets and came up with nothing but a few coins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it prompted my own . He found the key inside his wallet , tucked into a back pocket . <p> I liked his laugh when he pulled it out and fit it into the door . The lock blinked red , and he muttered a curse I deciphered by tone , not by word . He tried again , his hands so big they engulfed the slim plastic card . I could n't stop staring at his hands . <p> " Fuck , " Sam said clearly , and handed me the card . " I ca n't get the door open . " <p> I reached for the card . Our hands touched . Then somehow his hand had encircled my wrist and my back pressed against the still-closed door . Sam pressed against my front . His mouth found mine already open for him . His hand discovered my leg already cocked to fit his grasp just behind my knee . He fit between my legs like the key ought to have fit in the lock , without hesitation , opening my door . His fingers slid higher beneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bare skin . <p> He hissed into my open mouth and his fingers tightened on my wrist . He lifted an arm above my head , pinning me with his hands and body and mouth to the door . There in the hall he kissed me for the first time , and there was nothing slow or easy about it . Nothing soft or hesitant . <p> Sam stroked my tongue with his . His belt buckle pushed my belly through my silky shirt . Lower , his cock nudged me , too , through the barrier of his jeans . He let go of my wrist . <p> " Unlock the door . " He stopped the kiss just long enough to speak into my mouth . <p> His hand hit the door handle as I rammed the key , without looking , into the lock . Behind me the door flew open with the pressure of our bodies , but neither of us stumbled . Sam was holding me too tightly for that . <p> He moved me , mouth still glued to mine , two steps into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slam of it echoed between my legs . Sam , breathing hard , pulled away to look into my eyes . <p> " This is what you want ? " <p> I found the voice to rasp , " Yes . " <p> He nodded , just once , and took my mouth again . His kiss might have bruised me , had he not pulled back just enough to keep it from hurting . Without the door holding me up , I had to rely on Sam 's arms around me . One slid behind my shoulders . The other left the secret treasure of my thigh to go around my lower back . He pulled me along with him even as he step-by-stepped me back toward the bed . It hit the back of my legs . He broke the kiss again . <p> " Hold on a second . " Sam reached around me to tug down the comforter , tossing it unceremoniously into a pile on the floor . <p> He grinned at me . His cheeks looked a bit flushed , his eyes a trifle sleepy-lidded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again into his arms . Mine went around his neck . His went around my waist . <p> We made it to the bed in a tangle of limbs and laughter . Sam was as long lying down as he was standing , but on the bed I could move up to kiss him without having to tilt my head so far . I found his throat , the jut of his Adam 's apple . His skin tasted of salt . I rubbed the first poking bristles of his beard with my lips . <p> My skirt had ridden up , helped by Sam 's hands . He pushed the material higher . One large hand cupped my thigh . The edge of his fingers brushed my panties , and my breath caught . <p> I looked up to see him looking down with an expression of mingled amusement and something else I could n't quite decipher . I took my mouth from his skin and sat up a little , pushing back but not pulling away . <p> " What ? " <p> His hand on my thigh shifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stretched out that way , his clothes askew and our limbs tangled , he looked enviably comfortable in his own skin . Men often did . Sometimes they had to put it on , that confidence , the way they put on cologne . Sam 's seemed more innate , an awareness of himself as much a part of him as the color of his eyes or those long , long legs . <p> He shook his head . " Nothing . " <p> " It ca n't be nothing , " I said . " You 're looking at me funny . " <p> " Am I ? " He sat up a little but did n't take his hand from my thigh . He crossed his eyes and stuck out his tongue . " Was it like this ? " <p> I burst into laugher . " Not quite . " <p> " Ah , good . " Sam nodded and leaned to catch my mouth in another kiss , speaking without taking his lips from mine . " That would have been embarrassing . " <p> Then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceeded to kiss me breathless . His hand stayed on my thigh , sometimes slipping down closer to my knee and moving up again , but though his fingers occasionally brushed the lace of my panties , he never actually touched me there . He did n't lie on top of me , either , squooshing , but kept his weight to the side . Nothing was going quite as I 'd expected but was n't that what I wanted ? To be surprised ? <p> He kissed me fast . He kissed me slow . He nibbled and nuzzled and licked , and all the while his hand stayed in its maddening position so close to where I wanted it , but never quite making it there . <p> " Sam , " I whispered finally , hoarsely , unable to take it any longer . <p> He paused in kissing me to look into my eyes . " Yes , Grace ? " <br> Continues ...
