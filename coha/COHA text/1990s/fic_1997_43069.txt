TRAPPER IS SO OLD AND TIRED that every August he just sits in the sun in front of his cabin with his head bowed , trying to gather up the last of it . A week of heat left , and then each day after will be cooler . He sits with his arms spread and tries to gather it all in , absorbing the vitamin D. Everything is draining from him . He used to love winter the most ; now he tries only to stagger from August to August , each year , crossing the months like stepping-stones across a dangerous river . Maybe the breadth of time he 's spent in the woods turned Trapper 's mind : his need to be versatile , to change with the seasons . Or maybe it 's the absence of cities , towns , or villages . It was n't something , though , that human contact could stave off in him , or else his wife would have kept it at bay . He wants her back worse than he ever wanted a pelt . Judith has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the cabin 's small window on a January night during the wolf moon when Trapper was having one of his fits . At such times something wild enters him . Trapper is as pale as a snow lion . Judith came from Tucson , and was still brown ten years after she left . It was as though in Arizona she 'd stored a lifetime of sun . <p> Judith has curved feet , like flippers . She 's six feet tall ( Trapper is five nine ) , and her shoe size is thirteen . Judith gets around in the snow real well ; the inward curve of her feet makes it so she does n't need snowshoes . <p> In Trapper 's nighttime fits , he imagines that he is a wolf , and the others in his pack have suddenly turned against him and set upon him with their teeth ; he 's roused in bed to snarl and snap at everything in sight . <p> And then there are the daytime fits , when he imagines he has become someone else , in the manner of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the seasons ; or of the deer and caribou , whose habits change ; or the bear , who goes to sleep , falling down into that deep , silent place-beneath a dozen feet of snow by January-where his brave heart beats once a minute-where everything 's very , very slow .... <p> When Trapper would get that way-changed-he 'd turn to Judith and begin speaking in the third person , as if neither he nor she were there . His eyes would n't blink as he turned slowly to Judith to say : " Trapper says there is a storm coming " ; or , " Trapper says there are too many wolves in the woods " ; or-increasingly- " Trapper says he does n't feel good . " <p> Judith hated to leave him like that . When Trapper held his hands out in front of him they shook like leaves , and he was only thirty-five years old . Maybe his body would live forever , but his mind was going , and Judith was too smart to ride it to the end . <p> He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fumbling with and bumping the hair triggers . Increasingly , he 'd arrive home with crushed and broken fingers . <p> " Trapper says he does n't know what 's happening , " he 'd say , and Judith 's heart would flood away from her like loose water . She 'd feel wicked about it , but she was changing , too-she could hear the distance calling her some nights , could see the northern lights whooshing and crackling so close as to seem just over the next ridge . She 'd want to leave right then , right there . The northern lights , or something , were calling her name . Judith stayed as watchful in bed as a cat , never sleeping now as the lights sprayed green and red beams across the dark sky : she was waiting , waiting for one more wolf fit . When it finally came , she would be up and through that small glass window . <p> Judith cut herself , breaking through it-Trapper had barred the door to keep trouble out , she knew , though as he grew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her in-and he 'd been able to track her a ways , following her blood . Howling as he went , he sounded like a wolf in his sadness . But Trapper had had to stop to pull on the snowshoes he 'd managed to grab from their place by the door , and in this span Judith drew away from him . She had the advantage of speed , and she knew where she was going-up and over that northern ridge-while Trapper had to pause , going from track to track , bloodspot to bloodspot . A heavy snow was beginning to fall through the trees as if trying to wash away the moon , and Judith ran for the ridge with her 50-yard head start , and then it was 100 yards ; she was crying , and tears were freezing on her cheeks , but she knew she was now about 250 yards away from him . She could barely hear his howls . <p> She crossed a creek , soaking her boots over the ankles ; she gasped , clambered to the other side , and started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had ever really loved her-her-with her big , crooked feet . Faintly , she could still hear him . <p> Her feet were numb from the creek , but still she moved on , the quick-falling snow covering her tracks . <p> When Judith got to the top of the ridge , his howls were gone . She considered howling once , to let him know she was . . . what ? - all right ? not angry ? sad ? - but instead she turned and went down the other side , catching herself on the trunks of trees when she tripped over her large feet . Judith ran all night to stay warm , floundering , going north . She knew he 'd figure she was headed to a town . <p> It was true she 'd be safe in a town , because Trapper would never enter one to look for her-but he might go so far as to hang around on the outskirts , like an old lobo skulking near a campfire . <p> Judith did n't miss the desert . Sometimes she did-in the spring usually-but right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich , deep snow . The sadness of leaving him being transformed into the joy of freedom , and the joy of flight , too . <p> She imagined the sleeping bears beneath her . Her Uncle Harm had raised her in the desert outside Tucson , and then she took up with Trapper when they were both eighteen . Uncle Harm had been an old trapper and hunter and had tried to teach Trapper some things , but had not been entirely successful . Another year and Judith and Trapper would 've spent half their lives together . <p> It was delicious to swim through the snow . The blizzard was a sign that she was meant to escape . A fool could have followed her tracks under normal conditions , but these were n't normal conditions . This was the first night of her life . <p> It was n't about babies , or towns , or quilting bees . Domesticity . It was n't about flowers , or about the desert in spring . It might not even have been about his snarling fits , or his lonely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was about those red and green rods streaking through the sky , just to the north : just a little north of where she had been living . He was gone , Judith knew . It would be a luxury to feel sad about it . He 'd been gone for years . If he 'd been a deer or moose , elk or caribouif he 'd been prey instead of predator-something would have noticed his odd demeanor , his slowing step-that trembling-and would have singled him out and brought him down . <p> Judith slept at the base of a giant , fire-hollowed cedar for a short time before dawn . She took off her leather boots , her socks and leggings , and tucked them between her body and clothes to dry . She half-dozed with her hands around her naked feet , trying to warm and dry them . The cedar jungle where she had stopped offered shelter against much of the snow and wind ; the deer had taken refuge there , too . They 'd been living in the tangle of cedars for several weeks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ milling together for warmth . Great curved antlers lay scattered all around her ; the antlers were being covered quickly with skiffs of snow-the drifts were n't as deep back in the cedars-and Judith could feel the deer watching her . She dreamed that she could feel the warmth of their breath as they moved slowly over to investigate . Her coat and pants were made of deer hide , deer Trapper had shot for her to skin and sew into garments . <p> Judith slept as the deer circled and sniffed her and looked at one another in the deep night and waited out the storm . <p> The wolves would notice his odd gait , Judith dreamed . If Trapper tried to follow her too far in his condition-his sleepwalking-the wolves would get him . <p> Spring , even the hint of it , was still three months away . <p> She dreamed of Tucson , holding her cold toes in her hands : rubbing them in her sleep . <p> It was still snowing outside the cedar jungle when her shivering woke her . Judith considered whether she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold . She could see the deer tracks around her where they had come in the night ; she could see where they had stopped to sniff and identify her . They had touched her , she knew , with their noses : they had given her her identity . <p> It is not that he is a bad man , or that I am a bad woman , she thought . It 's just that he is a predator , and I am prey . It is the way of nature for our lives to be associated , even intertwined , for a long while . But now , if I am to survive , I have to run . It has nothing to do with him . It used to ; but now , suddenly that I 'm free , it does n't . <p> It is so sad , she thought ; but even as she was thinking this , she was pulling on her damp socks , her damp boots and leggings , and dusting the snow from her clothes and rising stiffly , her legs as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sorrowful feet . She stared at the deer 's delicate tracks . <p> He is gone , Judith told herself again . I am not running from him anymore , I am running from his death . Trapper is gone . <p> She looked up the next ridge , into the wind-and-north-stunted alpine fir ; a little farther north , she knew , there would be tundra . She definitely did not want to leave the woods . <p> No , she remembered then , I am no longer running from anything . I am running to something . <p> Her feet were hurting , which was good ; the blood was returning . Judith limped down a game trail . Snow was still falling . Her long yellow hair shrouded her neck and face and kept the snow out . It was too cold for it to melt . Trapper used to brush her hair every night ; brush and then wash it . Already she missed his broken-fingered hands . <p> " Trapper is gone , " she repeated out loud , like a mantra , as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the snow still coming down , she would find a gaunt-ribbed deer dying in the cedar jungle , starving , and she would chase it a short distance-the deer falling and floundering , crazy-legged , unable to go on-and she would kill it by cutting its throat with her knife . <p> Judith drank the blood from the cut throat , but only after the deer was dead and its eyes were turning waxy blue , its soul rising into the trees . <p> Then the liver , still hot ; steam rising from it as she cut it free . Then the blood that was sloshing inside the body cavity . Judith washed the blood from her face with handfuls of snow ; skinned the deer quickly while it was still warm , before it could freeze ; and cut the meat from the shoulders and hamstrings and wrapped it in the congealed hide . Tied it to her back . <p> Judith felt the woods wrapping her , taking care of her in her sorrow , and she thanked them every step of the way for giving her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was how her Uncle Harm-the one who 'd taught Trapper certain things , though not everything-used to feel , because he 'd talked about it often , back in Arizona . <p> Deer stood aside , too cold to run , and watched her pass . Judith felt badly : not knowing why she was moving , only that she must . Grizzlies will travel thirty miles in a night , she knew , to get to a good acorn crop . Deer and elk will leave a mountain , will come down off the highest peak and into the river bottoms in advance of a storm , in only a matter of hours . But Judith was not entirely sure why she was traveling-and why she was moving north , into the winter , rather than away from it . <p> It had been 106 degrees on the day she was born . But she 'd gotten used to the cold . It was n't that different from the heat . Both were things that got your attention . <p> Maybe it was as simple as the feeling that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but if she went north , it would just be running . Trapper hunted her for four days and nights , making concentric circles around his cabin , trying to pick up her sign : making the circles larger and larger ; calling her name and crying and howling . Chasing the game off : ruining his season . <p> Betrayed ; abandoned . He 'd thought she was tame . He 'd not understood she was the wildest , most fluttering thing in the woods . He thinks , Next time , when I get her back , I will keep her tied up even tighter . I will tie her with rawhide to a stake in the front yard . <p> He thinks , She did n't love me enough . Maybe she even hated me . But what about all those good times in Tucson ? And up here ? <p> I will make her love me more , he thinks , wandering his woods , casting for scent-trembling like an old dog . He hunts for her harder than he ever hunted for any grizzly or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , forgets where he 's hung them : leaves them untended . <p> Martens dangle from the trunks of trees , a rear leg snapped , broken by the trap 's jaws . At first they scramble and chatter to get free , but over time their movements become slower . They hang like small shawls against the bark , snow catching on their fur , and the traps rusting .... <p> If Judith had heard Trapper cry like a child she probably would have gone back to him and stayed until he got better , or did n't . But some instinct-and fear-told her to go all the way up to the edge of the forest , to winter away from him , in a place where she could not be lured back . <p> Maybe in the spring , Judith thought , she 'd ease back and spy on his cabin . See if he had made it or not . See if he 'd survived , or if he was bones . <p> Forty , fifty , fifty-five below . She ca n't build a fire , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurry . She builds a snow cave in the cedar jungle , makes a coat of her deer hide , but still she 's cold , even with two coats . She does n't dare build a fire . Even mind-sick , Trapper can smell smoke at a hundred miles . <p> Such is her fear , and the word beyond fear : longing . <p> Trapper sleeps with the window open-the one she crashed through - to punish himself for letting her escape . He knows she 's not building fires-he 'd smell them . If he could just find where she is , he could begin setting traps for her , but he has no idea whether she is east or west or north or south . He feels trapped by his ignorance , and thrashes around on his bed at night and moans and howls ... . His trap-cracked fingers surge with pain ; they 've been frostbitten so many times that each new time they freeze , he 's sure he 'll lose them , that this time the blood wo n't return ; and what good is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be no better than a bear , with nothing but paws . He dreams again of August . <p> Trapper remembers the big grizzly he killed down in the Gila desert , back in the ' 90s . Its tracks were thirteen by eleven inches-the feet as long as Judith 's , but so very much wider-and Trapper remembers how the bear dragged his chain and trap twelve miles up into the mountains and into a cave . Trapper had nailed the trap and chain to a twelve-foot timber , and he followed the swath the bear made as he fled . October . Buzzards shadowed the trail , knowing what was coming . It was easy for Trapper to follow at a dead run as there were the birds to look to , and the trail was like the wake of a canoe . Trapper has never owned a horse : he despises and distrusts anything stronger than he is . <p> As Trapper 's shakes set in , Judith got that way : stronger than he was . He still had his strength , but when he was trembling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 'd have to ask for her help . The glimmer of reasoning that this might have frightened her as badly as it frightened him glows in his mind , and then fades . He 's remembering this bear in the Gila . <p> You must tie a drag to the trap for the prey to run with , but one that will only slow the animal down . If you tie the chain too tight , the bear or wolf-with no hope of escape-will chew its damn leg off to get away . <p> This Gila River grizzly holed up in a cave . It was a smart bastard . It ambushed Trapper , trap and chain and log and all . Wrapped him up as best it could , biting at his face and neck . The only thing that saved Trapper was that the bear 's teeth had been broken by the huge steel trap : he 'd tried to bite it off . Still , the bear raked Trapper 's back with his terrible claws . The first bear that ever got in close with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trapper was nineteen . He grabbed the bear 's big tongue the way he 'd been told and twisted like hell ; the bear released his grip , and Trapper pulled his knife free and stuck it up under the ribs , again and again , probing for the heart . Found it . <p> Bright red blood and froth and slobber and bits of tooth all over his face . He had to sleep on his stomach for three months . He remembers how Judith would lick the wounds ; and then , when they healed , how she would lick the scars . They were living on her Uncle Harm 's ranch , in an adobe by the Salt River . White-winged doves cooing all the time . The mornings were cool ; everything seemed new . <p> Nineteen ! <p> He did n't know if his seed was bad or if she was barren . Nothing ever happened , and he 's not sure , as he trembles now , ancient at thirtyfive , that that was a bad thing . <p> Candlelight washes across his crooked face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In February it warmed to fifteen below . It had been so cold that Judith 's head hurt : she got a little crazy , afraid to go to sleep for fear her head would split the way the dry fir trees had been cracking open every January night . She could n't move around , could n't walk through the woods with her ugly feet , unless it was snowing hard ; she could n't risk leaving tracks . <p> Judith figured she was about twenty-five miles north of him . She could sense by the stillness in the woods-the utter emptiness and newness and peace-that he had no idea where she was hiding . <p> But he would find out . He would sense that emptiness , that peacehe would feel her feeling it-and he would be drawn toward it , perhaps without ever knowing why . She would have to be ready to move again , and quickly . <p> She wanted to get away-but not too far away . <p> There were nights when she felt he was still tied to her : she knew he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> But it felt fine to be alone , and to be free of his air . It was n't bad air that he breathed in and out ; it was just his . When it began to snow , she would rise and go for walks in the woods , walking through the heaviest snowstorms . She 'd found a winterkilled moose and made a robe of it , to add to her other coats . She wore all of them when she walked , and when she got lost and could not find her way back to her snow cave , as frequently happened , she 'd build a new one . She was following a ridge above a river bottom , over into the next valley . It was a country Trapper had never worked before , and sometimes Judith would catch herself with the ludicrous thought that she would have to tell him about it when she got back . <p> Remember , Judith told herself , he is gone . <p> She was pretty sure he was gone . <p> Her hair was wild and dirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troubled her . But it was n't enough to turn back for : the simple touch of his busted-up hands , brushing and washing her hair , and a warm fire . <p> A wolverine confronted her one day , ran scampering around her snow cave , raising his hind leg and pissing all around , a vile scent that reminded her of maggots . He stuck his snarling face into her cave , and Judith screamed and jabbed her knife at him , cutting his nose , and the wolverine ran away , lunging across the snow like a man with a broken back , squalling and leaving a trail of blood but looking over his shoulder at her as if to say , " I 'll be back . " <p> Judith cut a heavy walking stick and lashed the sharpest deer antlers she could find to the end of it . She never went anywhere without it , and had nightmares about the wolverine until she found him dead in March , where wolves had killed him . <p> The meat of the wolverine had been too mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his entrails . Ravens led her to the carcass . It pleased Judith to think of the wolves eating his guts . But she moved on , because he 'd marked her cave as his territory with his terrible piss , and the woods were spoiled . <p> She kept moving north whenever it snowed , from one pocket of stillness and peace to the next . <p> It was exactly as if she had an injury , and had to let the muscle and bone knit and regather strength . It took time . <p> In February , Trapper had abandoned his cabin and gone south looking for her . By the first week he knew she could be dead and under five or six feet of snow-that he might not find her skeleton for ten or twenty years , or ever-but he pushed on , casting for scent . He knew she would cross at least one divide , possibly two . The way she had hit that window : he knew she was terrified of something . <p> It was the first time in eighteen years that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He stood by his fire each night , the trembling having spread from his hands to his shoulders and legs . He was alone , and-he acknowledged this-there was something wrong with him , something time would not fix-but he felt good . <p> He 'd piss on his campfire each night to let the wolves know he was there . He heard their howls , the whole of the woods echoing with their sound . Trapper knew that in winter they were all only two days from starving . <p> He worked a hundred miles south in a week , then fifty miles east of that line , coming back across it , and fifty miles west . <p> " Sombofambitch , " he said in March , when he finally felt the peace and could acknowledge its presence . He was having trouble with his speech . " She has gonb norf . . . norf. . norf . " His heart was fluttering , and his legs , when they trembled , felt like a colt 's . <p> He was back at his cabin , padding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have an ankle broken . He would set them in the spring . <p> The scent , or feel , of her peace reminded him of the northern lights . No one else he knew ever claimed to hear them , but he could : the sound was faint , to be sure , but clearly there , and it was like strips of thin metal delicately chiming . Trapper believed in angels and a God , though he had never seen either , and believed without doubt that the red and green of the northern lights showed where angels had been : just a day 's passage ahead of him , or two days at most . <p> Trapper started north with a hundred pounds of traps slung over his shoulder . He had n't used sled dogs in five years ; the wolves always killed them , and he was tired of the heartache of losing them . <p> Aiming north and west , he figured she 'd head for the ocean-women love oceans , he thought , and men love forests . <p> He came near her on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Judith was sitting on the bluff , looking out over the western river bottom , when she felt his presence in the woods and then , an hour later , saw him walking below her , all those heavy chains thrown across his shoulder : his steps with the snowshoes looking big and sloppy . <p> She watched him cross the frozen river with his traps . She could n't see his face or even his beard , and certainly not his strange blue eyes , which turned almost violet in late winter , as if from the absence of something , or in anticipation , perhaps , of spring . <p> She could make out his wide back , the heavy robes he was wearing , and his clumsy steps . She watched as if it were her wedding day ; she felt that much love for him , and that much relief that he was missing her . He stopped often to look at tracks in the river bottom , but they were not her tracks . <p> In Arizona , Trapper had fried everything in lion grease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all sizzled in the sweet fat of the mountain lions he killed . Old folks said it would go to his brain and give him the trembles later in life , and maybe it did , but watching him move across the river bottom-trembling , though still somehow in possession of his strength-Judith does n't think that 's what did it . <p> She thinks it is the force of God blowing through the trees that makes him shake . He has chased things so long and so hard he has gotten cut off . He 's gotten lost , or dead-ended , or trapped . Or something . Anyway , he does n't look ready to die . He looks like he 's holding steady . <p> Judith watched Trapper cross the river : heading all the way to the coast , she suspected-salmon , boats , fishing villages-just to look for her . It made her feel good in a way she had n't felt in a long while . <p> Trapper moved slowly . Judith stayed behind a tree and watched . He was hundreds of feet below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned and looked back up the bluff , right at her . Tears began to roll down Judith 's cheeks , freezing before they fell , as she felt all her precious space shattering in his gaze , his discovery-but he was looking right through her . Trapper turned away again . <p> Immediate relief became joy , but then Judith felt an echo of sadness , like a stone dropped , clacking to the bottom of a nearly dry well on a hot day . <p> She watched him make his way across the mile-wide frozen river . He did n't have long to get to the coast and back before the breakup of the ice left him stranded-the river would surge in a month or six weeks with jagged icebergs , cracking and booming , frothing with dead moose and bear bobbing in its torrent , young , foolish animals who 'd tried to cross it . It occurred to Judith that maybe Trapper was n't coming back . <p> He still had not come straight north . She believed that when he did not find her on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last place he would have suspected her to be . It was a miracle that he had not seen her when he 'd looked up the bluff . Judith had held her breath to keep from exhaling smoke-vapor , and had n't blinked-just those slow , round , crystal , frozen tears leaking from her . She had seen Trapper spot live animals hidden in the forest at greater distances . Despite the beauty of his violet eyes , he was color-blind ; he saw a monochromatic world , grainy blacks and whites of tone . Winter did n't bother his eyesight because it was how he always saw the world-and animals that relied on camouflage were helpless , revealed bluntly , nakedly , before his gaze . <p> After Trapper was gone , Judith felt that dry-well sorrow and fear , but then the fear left and joy returned . She wished him well on his journey and worried for him , but reasoned that any time spent trembling in the woods was infinitely preferable to time spent trembling on a bed in a cabin or-worse-in a town . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way to the North Pole , was hers-her own space . <p> She could not wait for spring , when color would fill that space and her world would burst with life . <p> They had left Arizona when the first silver and copper mines were going in and cattle were sweeping across the desert and fouling the brief rivers . In the Santa Cruz River , which steamships cruised , there had been trout a foot and a half long-but five years after the cattle showed up , the rivers had turned to silt plains , and there were n't enough wolves to turn the cattle back . Trapper regretted that he had helped see to that . <p> He had never poisoned wolves the way the ranchers did . He trapped them instead , then hit them in the head with a club to keep from ruining the pelts . <p> Judith 's Uncle Harm was the one who taught him how to trap . Judith has tried to imagine Trapper being anything else in life-a miner , or a schoolteacher-but ca n't see it . She takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Uncle Harm and herself , Trapper would be dead . Invisible . <p> She takes this to mean , indirectly , that she saved his life . If he had not fallen in hot love with her , he would never have learned to trap . <p> Uncle Harm was seventy-seven and failing when Trapper showed up . He still hunted and trapped , but was mostly hunting with dogs by that time and no longer tried to get physically involved with his prey . <p> When he 'd been younger-Trapper 's age-Uncle Harm had hunted the way Trapper did-on foot , stalking and laying traps , shooting from ambush , and taking on the animals in his traps with only a knife or a club . Uncle Harm was the first white man to perfect the old Yaqui Indian 's trick of hunting down and engaging a grizzly-getting it to charge - and then swatting its wrists with an iron bar , breaking them , thereby improving the odds considerably ; dodging the crippled bear 's jaws and killing it with a knife or lance after that . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grizzly down in Chihuahua . The grizzly was so big that it simply pulled free of the giant trap , leaving behind part of its foot and two huge claws . Whenever Uncle Harm spoke of this , he took care to mention how the flesh-end nerves of the freshly pulled claws were still red with life , glowing in the trap . <p> The tracks of the escaped bear were plain , and Uncle Harm , a young man of thirty-three at the time , followed them easily and quickly . At a sharp bend in the trail he found what he wanted . The hurt grizzly had backtracked to the bend to wait . <p> There was no time to lift his club or his knife . The bear knocked Uncle Harm down with one swat , breaking his collarbone , then bit him on the skull-Judith had heard him preach that the human skull is irresistible to grizzlies , that they like to puncture it like a ringtail cat popping eggs-and then , when the bear heard Uncle Harm 's skull pop , he moved his attentions to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uncle Harm was dying fast , and he knew his only chance was to play dead , which he was having no trouble doing . He shut his eyes while the grizzly picked him up and dragged him back and forth across the manzanita , smearing the bushes with his blood . Still Uncle Harm played dead , trying to outlast the animal 's rage . <p> The grizzly finally dropped him and ran off , only to return to shake him again so hard that it almost broke Uncle Harm 's neck . The bear bit him in the face , then stood over Uncle Harm before nosing him , as if trying to bring his victim back to life so he could kill him again . The bear leaned down and snorted in his ear , trying to make him jump , but Uncle Harm remained dead . He heard the bear limp off after that , and consciousness left him . <p> When he awoke it was night . He crawled back down the creek to a small spring . Another wolf hunter found him the next day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but my looks , " Uncle Harm would always say , motioning to his terrible , grinning face , " were never thereafter complimentary . " <p> Trapper loved the old man : loved him deeply . Sometimes Judith thinks Trapper should have married Uncle Harm instead of her . He loved to be with the old man . Uncle Harm fried all his food in lion grease too , though he never got the shakes . When Harm got really old and had to resort to chasing animals with dogs rather than on foot , he would circle around the desert on his mule with a gramophone horn lifted to his near-deaf ears , trying to pick up the sound and direction of his dogs ' squallings as they battled a bear or a lion . He insisted on going out on his own-would n't share his territory , the Galliero Mountains , with anyone , not even Trapper-and when he got older still , there were days when Trapper and Judith did n't know if he 'd make it back . At such times , they would search for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd have gotten tired and stopped to camp by a creek on his way in , with a grizzly hide and the quartered carcass packed across his mule , his dogs panting in the shade , all scratched and cut up from the fight-Uncle Harm looking five or ten years younger every time he killed something . But there were other times , sad times , when they 'd go out and find Uncle Harm , loopy from dehydration , spinning on his back on the desert floor , staring wild-eyed up at the great white autumn clouds while his dogs stood around in a confused circle , wanting to step in and lick him but unable to move in among his flailing arms and legs . The saddled mule would be off in the shade chewing saltbush , unconcerned , with no grizzly or lion pelt across its saddle . Uncle Harm looked a hundred years old on such days , wildeyed , too , and with his canteen stone-empty .... <p> Judith and Trapper would gather him up , lift him onto his fool mule , give him water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him from the sun . They would walk home : a whole day 's hunting ruined for Trapper , but he did n't care . Back then Trapper could take it or leave it . Uncle Harm 's facial scars glowed pale blue whenever he had heatstroke . There was a muddy creek behind their adobe house , and they 'd float him in that until he returned to himself . <p> By nightfall , when the coyotes were singing , Harm would be better - he 'd have crawled from the creek and gone to his little house ( Trapper and Judith lived in the big house ) , and there he would change into his white linen evening suit . He 'd fix a cup of pinon-leaf tea and go sit on his porch and listen to the night . He 'd tell Trapper and Judith trapping stories , and secrets , and in the morning , though there would be new scars and stretch marks upon his heart , he would be ready to go out and kill again . <p> He kept going . Judith thought it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man would like and admirethe way Uncle Harm ruined himself . He kept driving , mindless-pursuing . It makes her sad to realize that the times she loved Trapper most were when he was hunting the least . It makes her feel guilty , too , because when Trapper was not hunting he was paying attention to her and loving her . Does this mean she ca n't love Trapper for what he is , but only for what he can give her ? <p> Nobody could be that evil , she thinks . It 's simply a matter of where he puts his heart . It 's very simple , Judith thinks . He puts his heart in the woods , or he puts it in the palm of her hand . His heart clinches hers as though they are two elk with their noble antlers linked , if only by accident , in combat . <p> Back before Harm broke off the gramophone horn to take with him , Judith would stay in bed with Trapper all through the hot part of the day , the sweet middle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only to put a new record on : both of them abed in the cool shade of love , never suspecting that in a few short years the desert would be gone . Shitting cattle would scour it , and water-robbing mesquite would grow out of their manure-shit-pile muffins cast like steppingstones across the land-and with that the rarest and wildest creatures would leave , vanish . <p> The last music Judith heard , other than the howls of wolves , was in 1904 . She listens for the northern lights that Trapper says he can hear , but she hears nothing : though even the sound of nothing , with enough space around her , is pleasant and sweet . Not as good as the sound of running water , which she knows will be coming-but in winter the sound of nothing is just right . The howls of wolves reassure and comfort her , as though a deal has been struck whereby they will take sadness from her heart and assume it for themselves . <p> Judith builds a tiny cabin out of wind-felled timbers , stretches her hide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Trapper did n't look sick , she thinks . Maybe he has gotten better without me . This inspires in her the desire to capture him and see if it is so . Judith 's not sure she wants him to be better off without her . <p> It is n't about children , Judith tells herself . She remembers the old woman they met in Yellowknife who said she 'd had thirteen children by her first husband , but her new husband , " Art , his seed is bad . " <p> Judith knows women with children who 've run , and she knows women without children-such as herself-who have also run . <p> Uncle Harm trapped or killed almost everything in Arizona and then died in 1909 at the age of ninety-one . He 'd taken to shooting cows when there was nothing else around ; dropping them like buffalo , fifteen and twenty at a time , then hiding out and waiting for the coyotes and the last few lobos to come skulking in . It was easier to find him once he started shooting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his stand . <p> His dogs were by his side , guarding him , the day Trapper and Judith found him for the last time . Dried up , wizened , Uncle Harm had already been gone about half a day , headed toward wherever he was going beyond this life . His gramophone horn was curled tightly in his little fist , and Judith took it from him gently . After they 'd buried him , she tried to hook it back up , but the gramophone would n't work , not even after they cleaned all the dust and grit out of it . <p> They had to bury him way off in the desert so he would n't foul the spring . Piled rocks on his grave to form a cairn , but still the few remaining coyotes and wolves gathered around it and howled every night for a month . The summer rains came , and they could see where a few grizzlies had emerged from hiding and circled the cairn as if to see for themselves that yes , it was true , they were safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Damnedest thing either of them had ever seen , with the exception of Uncle Harm himself . <p> They sold his dogs to a cattle rancher , opened all the doors and windows of the adobe houses to let the desert enter , and went up through the Rockies in the spring . But the grizzlies and wolves and Indians had vanished there , too , so they kept going farther north . Trapper and Judith did n't reach the Yukon until fall . <p> When they started hearing wolves , they felt better . As if they had come home ; as if what mattered lay south or north of their country , but not in-between . <p> II <p> It 's Trapper 's aim to catch wolves and martens and wolverines on his trip to the coast , and pull the hides behind him on a sled , arriving there a rich man and trading for gold , for groceries . Coffee from Africa , sugar from the tropics , to maybe keep Judith happy this time . Maybe while she 's staked out in the yard he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she would enjoy his new riches so much that he would n't have to keep her staked , at least not all the time . <p> She 's lost her mind , Trapper muses , moving through the woods , shaking and stutter-stepping . She hit that window like a bat out of hell . It was like something old Harm might have done . <p> Big smoked salmon and new traps , new ammunition , too-lead and gunpowder . And jewelry : he 'll trap her with gold jewelry , he thinks ; he 'll string it all through the woods and then set snares , or hide up in a tree so that when she reaches for the glittering-with-sun necklace he can catch her wrist in a wire noose , and he 'll have her , have her again . The mistake last time was that he did n't hold her tight enough , that he gave her too much rein .... <p> He 'll build smaller windows . <p> More leg-hold traps , more tobacco . Fuck horses ! He 'll pull it all home on a sled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dogs ! Whiny crybabies , always wanting to rest . Always getting eaten by wolves . His beard and eyebrows are shining dull whitish-blue with frost-it 's thirty below-and he howls . <p> The wolves that have been following at a distance draw closer , knowing they are safe when a fit wells up from within him ; at such times they know that he is not a man but one of them . They seem to believe he would be loath to kill one of his own kind-a brother , a sister . It 's so lonely without her . <p> What if she 's not even up here anymore ? What if she 's back in Arizona ? He 's ashamed that his heart is a weak little muscle , incapable of matching the great strength of the chest in which it is housed . Can it be true that he is as weak in heart and mind and soul as Harm was in body ? Can it be that he has an animal 's soul trapped within him ? Maybe that 's why trapping never bothered him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sideways and shattered in the trap , quiver and look at him in fright as he approaches ; they grasp the metal jaws with the slender fingers of their uninjured paws . Already the beautiful shawl they wear does not belong to them . <p> A man can be a horrible thing . Trapper sits on a log and howls and weeps , but there seems to be no escape-nor does he know where he wants to escape to . <p> He hears a movement in the brush and snow behind him . He grabs his rifle and turns and raises it and sees a pale silver wolf running away ; Trapper fires and sends the wolf tumbling , but he 's only wounded it , the wolf is back up and running again . There are other wolves with it , and so he will not go into the brush after them , though the blood trail tempts him . <p> It 's not his fault that Judith got away , part of him tells himself when he 's shaking-when he 's trying to become whatever it is his body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fodder for worms-but the other part of him , the stronger part , says , " She was in your dominion , and you had control of her , and lost her . " <p> For thirty miles slogging through snow he thinks of words like dominion and replays every day of their life together , putting the days together like tracks , but he 's puzzled , can find no sign of error , no proof of her unhappiness with him . <p> He 's got four wolf pelts , six foxes , a dozen weasels , a coyote , and a wolverine on his sled-his stone boat-which he drags through the forest . He tries to think like the animals , and yet at the same time to keep his wits about him and keep from plunging off the cliff of human reason and into some abyss where man , having failed at something , descends to a level equal with the animals . <p> Loopy with fatigue , Trapper snaps off the branches of winter-thin willows along a creek , weaves them into a crown , and continues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he goes . <p> On the coast Trapper asks around , speaking all three languagesYupik , French , and English-awkwardly : the damn woods having swallowed his tongue . But no one 's seen her . The men and women cluck their tongues . One old woman laughs at him and says in Yupik , " If you lived here she would be easy to trap , for she would have nowhere to run to but the sea . " <p> He stays a night , buys sex from a villager for one wolf pelt-an outrageous price-makes his trades the next day , and heads back across the tundra , back to the woods , with another storm coming in behind him from the Arctic Ocean . He 'll trap on the way home , too , though he must be careful and hurry or he 'll run out of snow in places and ruin his sled pulling it across the bare rocks . <p> And then there 's the river . Trapper ca n't swim . He can do all manner of things , spectacular things , with his body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with muscle that whenever he gets in water he goes straight to the bottom . Like a rock . <p> Trapper moves through the woods herking and jerking , pulling his load , trying , with his mind alone , to trick his central nervous system into not disintegrating further ; into not acknowledging that disintegration . He notices that he 's trying to tie his knots backward , and it scares him . <p> To keep his mind off how far this nonsense can go , he concentrates on bears . He imagines how the woods are full of sleeping bears , all denned up beneath him , six feet beneath his snowshoes and curled , waiting to come to life . He thinks of bears and goes over the facts versus the myths . <p> Bears do not suck their paws in hibernation . They merely sleep with their paws pressed against their faces . The Indians in southern British Columbia maintained that a grizzly sighting a lone man in the forest would stand up and hold out one paw toward the man , even if seen or scented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was skookum-brave . What 's it going to be like to be dead ? Trapper catches himself wondering . He views the trembling as accelerated old age , or fatigue-but now he remembers Uncle Harm spinning on his back in the desert , looking up at those clouds . <p> The thing was , Uncle Harm always got better . They 'd lay him down in that cool water , and then later in the evening they 'd see him come stepping out of the Arizona darkness in his glowing white linen suit . They 'd smell his pinon-leaf tea . He 'd sit on their porch and tell them stories : true stories , amazing things that seemed capable of holding even death at bay . <p> The bear up near Prescott that kept raiding Uncle Harm 's family 's garden when he was a boy . Harm and his friend Dobie , fourteen years old , waiting and watching in the moonlight as the big silver-tipped grizzly came ambling into the garden and began swatting down the corn . July night thunder , monsoons walking across the far horizon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that thunder coming , Uncle Harm said , that you had to kill something . <p> With lanterns and rifles , Harm and Dobie would start yelling and sic their dogs on the great bear and head for the garden , running hard : half-crazy and half-brave , even then . ( Dobie died young . ) The bear would gather all the corn it could carry , holding it under one arm , and run . A grizzly can hit speeds of up to forty miles an hour , and runs faster up a hill than down , due to the extraordinary pistonmusculature of its hind legs . Certainly even on three legs the grizzly could outrun two boys and their pissant feist dogs . The boys tracked it more by following the spilled ears of corn than with the aid of their cowardly pets , but could never catch up with the grizzly , could never bring it to bay . <p> The grizzly kept coming back every night . Sometimes the boys heard him , and other times they slept through his raids . Finally one night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a friend of Dobie 's father . The neighbor lived a half-mile away . They muzzled it so the owner would n't wake up in the night and hear his dog off on a bear trail , alone-and they tied double leashes to him so he could n't get away . Tied the other ends around their waists . <p> They lay down on the dark porch in ambush and waited . August , now , and the corn beginning to dry up . They could feel something was nearing an end . <p> " Tonight we get him , " Dobie whispered . <p> After midnight they heard the bear in the corn again , and they sat there and waited , letting him fill his belly so he 'd be easier to chase . There was a wind in their faces , and the Airedale , with cloth wrapped around his muzzle , whined softly , but the breeze carried his soft sounds away from the bear . Lightning storms rippled across the plateaus to the south . <p> When the bear stood up and began knocking down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned the Airedale loose , and were snatched off the porch and out into the garden after him . <p> Uncle Harm said they each broke an arm , that the Airedale took them seven miles up into the mountains , that he would not stop , and that Dobie split his chin on a rock . <p> Still , the dog carried them on : across tiny creeks , farther up into the mountains . They 'd spy a dropped ear of corn every now and then . Sometimes they 'd see the silver bear disappearing over a ridge : running on all fours now , with the Airedale hard after him . Dobie had dropped his lantern and rifle when he split his chin , then had been whisked on , snatched along by the Airedale 's mad rage . The lantern had started a small fire where he dropped it . Then , climbing farther up the mountain , the Airedale jerked Harm off his feet , and he lost his lantern as well , then was dragged along . <p> As they neared the summit they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . At the top of the mountain , the Airedaleclose to baying the bear-summoned a last charge and broke free of his harness , which probably saved the boys , allowing Harm to continue on his way to becoming an old man , and Dobie to live another two years . The Airedale engaged the grizzly up against the mouth of a cave . The dog must have known he could n't bite the bear , with his jaws still bound up in the tight-knotted muzzle , but such was his fury that he flew at the bear anyway . <p> Harm and Dobie crested the mountain , gasping . They saw the bear swat the Airedale , the limp dog fly away . The bear was standing at the mouth of a penned-up cave . Four or five pigs were grunting and squealing behind him ; there were corn husks everywhere as the bear had been feeding the pigs , fattening them , getting them ready to be eaten . <p> The bear squinted and raised his paw slowly , still standing , and held it out as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them the way a man might turn his palms to a campfire 's flames to warm them . Harm , with his rifle , was shaking so badly he could n't begin to lift it ; it was all he could do to keep from dropping it . <p> The bear did n't run . It kept standing there , holding its paw toward the boys and sniffing the night-storm air . <p> Uncle Harm said that both boys had the feeling-unspoken between them at the time but passing through the air like an electric currentthat the bear wanted to catch them alive , put them in that pen with the pigs , and fatten them up . <p> They ran down the mountain stumbling and bleeding , with thunder booming all around them , and never told anyone where the Airedale had gone . Told their parents they 'd gotten in a fight , is how they busted each other up . <p> The storm put out their fire , though for forty years , Harm said , you could see where they 'd been : and the bear never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up there , " Harm had told Trapper . " Pig skeletons , too . And dog skeleton . Never did find a bear skeleton on that mountain . Could have been that bear was God . Could be too that we 're all little pigs the real God 's got penned up on this earth , " Harm said , and then laughed . <p> " I want to know what happened to Dobie , " Judith said . Harm chuckled . " Drowned , " he said . He looked at Trapper and laughed again , his terrible old face stretching and then falling slack , stretching and then falling slack , stretching and falling slack . " You and him resemble each other in the face , " he said , reaching out to tousle Trapper 's wild hair . <p> He finds one stretch of woods that 's rampant with game , with life . He knows he should n't linger-knows he should get on back to the river , and across-but he can not help himself . He camps for a week and takes not one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who keeps coming around after the first one is taken-and he traps foxes , too . <p> And wolves : always , wolves . <p> He pushes on again , but he 's running late . The snow 's melting , and freezing again at night . It 's rough and chopped up ; roots and boulders are emerging . Trapper slips , falls often . Sometimes he ca n't get up and has to struggle to reach his sled , pulling a bloody wolf or fox hide from the stack to drape it across himself for warmth as night falls . The hide freezes during the night , fitting itself to Trapper 's shape . He hears wolves howl and has to bite his cheeks to keep from joining in : they 'd come investigate , and then his dreams might come true : the pack swarming him , casting judgment for all the pack members , the brotherhood that he 's killed-all the days of life he 's robbed . <p> Trapper knows there are n't any proven stories of wolves killing a white man-Uncle Harm told him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of Frenchmen , Eskimos , and Russians-but that 's no consolation as he quivers in the night , trapped in the form-fitting frozen fox hide . <p> Oh , for a wife or a dog ! <p> III <p> The river ice changes color in the last days of March , from white to gray , and from gray to thin blue , and Judith sits on the bluff and watches this . She listens to the ice groan and creak , straining to move again . She listens to the wolves howling . It is harder for them to hunt once winter is gone . In winter they can chase hooved animals , the weak ones , onto the frozen lakes and ponds . <p> Poor wolves , she thinks , watching the woods for Trapper 's return . The days are warm enough now that she does n't need fires , but finally she builds them along the bluff and throws wet duff on them to make them smoke . <p> It 's terrible without the thought of him out there chasing her , hunting her . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The river thaws first into ice floes that crash against each other , and then into fast blue water . Still he does not appear . <p> She remembers how Trapper gathered her urine once a month to use it with his traps ; she remembers how , that one time each month , the wolves would gather around their cabin and howl for a night or two , which excited Trapper terribly , made him pace the tiny cabin all night . <p> He 'd shout into the dark , and sometimes shoot his rifle : taking a bead on the great full grinning moon and then shouting , in the rifle 's echo-roar , when the moon did not fall and the wolves did not stop howling . <p> Maybe her womb was barren , or maybe his seed was bad . Maybe both . Or maybe it was like the wolf and the wolverine , who were not meant to mix ; like the bear and the badger . <p> She considers children . Remembers a man in Arizona whose son was killed by a bear , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and then slept on the hide every night for the rest of his life , another sixty-three years of falling asleep-or not-in the warmth of the killer 's thick fur . Thinking these things , Judith grows fond of her times with Trapper , and then one day he appears . A white-haired crooked figure on the far side of the river : it 's him , with about a thousand pelts on his sled . <p> Judith turns and runs : into the woods , leaping logs like a deer . She does n't want to go back to the past , or back to the warm lovesick days in Arizona with roast suckling goat and chimichurri sauce for breakfast , margaritas , and those doves cooing while they went to bed and made love : Harm , not Trapper , off in the desert . It feels wonderful to be running again . <p> Trapper has been seeing the smoke from her fires for days now ; it 's what turned him around . He 's been walking in circles , lost for the first time in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He knows finally what is happening to him . He 's busted open the skulls of a million animals , gathering their brains to use for tanning their hides , and he 's compared the highly ridged convolutions of a bear 's brain with the smoother , duller loops and folds of a marten , or the blankness of a boar-musky , raging wolverine 's brain-and Trapper can feel a certain silliness , a kind of numbness , like a skullcap , settling over the top of his own mind . <p> The loops of his brain-folds are losing their edges . <p> Maybe it was the lion grease . Or maybe loneliness . <p> He 's been walking in circles , setting traps that do n't catch anything . Sometimes he steps in his own snares-by some miracle avoiding the forty-five-pound bear traps , which would cut his legs off-but even when the metal jaws clap shut on his ankle , or his hand , he does n't really feel anything . <p> But the smoke : he still knew enough to go to the smoke . He still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe somehow she could save him . <p> He 'd stake her out yet . His arms are wizened , slack-muscled , and he stares at them , then squints across the river . She 's probably stronger than he is now , he thinks . He 'll have to do it with cunning . <p> He feels the loops unfolding . Thinks of how wolves pull the slick entrails out first and gulp them down , sometimes while the animal is still alive . <p> Trapper does n't blink . He ca n't feel anything . A million hardnesses are beginning to crash down upon him , and all he can think is , I want a million and one . <p> IV <p> It was thought by the savages of the North , Trapper knows , that bears are half-god and half-human ; that they are linked to the spirit world because they dig below the earth each autumn and come back out each spring . A bullshit stupid myth , Trapper thinks . <p> Fact : a bear just rising from the so-called spirit world does n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed bears just coming out of hibernation and has opened their stomachs out of curiosity and found live ants crawling there , ants the bear had licked up ten , twenty , maybe thirty minutes before Trapper came sauntering through the woods . <p> He 's building a hide boat : tanning and stretching the wolf hides on the riverbank and cutting green willow limbs . Maybe the boat will float and maybe it wo n't . He wonders why the Indians did n't think birds , like loons , belonged to the spirit world-diving under the water and then flying into the air . Or maybe they did . Maybe the Indians thought everything belonged to the spirit world . <p> When he finishes the boat , Trapper looks at the huge stack of hides he will have to leave behind . He could try and cache them , but he knows something-wolverine or bear-would find them soon enough . A damn shame . He piles branches and grass around the stack of rich furs , then chips stones until a spark catches . Soon the hides are a billowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the gravel riverbank . Trapper trembles but without feeling as he watches the smoke , as he watches the ghosts of the animals return to the sky . There is no spirit world , he thinks . There is just her , whom he wants to capture , on the other side of the river . If he can capture her-that blur through the forest , that movement in the corner of his mind 's eye-all will be made new again . <p> Spirit world , my butt , he thinks , turning to look at the river . He loads his traps into the round boat , readies the paddles he 's cut and carved , and pushes into the rapids . The river is wild with the loud underwater clunks of rocks bashing against one another . It 's so frigid he wo n't even live long enough to drown if the boat capsizes . <p> He rows like crazy , his small violet eyes fixed firmly on the far shore . He feels the rocks tumbling beneath him , feels the force of this one river on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back his thin white hair . He watches the shore without blinking . Remembers , in a glimpse , Uncle Harm 's mangled face . Remembers a coyote he saw running off with one of his drag-traps . The coyote was too smart to pull the drag-a grappling hook-through the brush , where it would get hung up . Instead , he carried the hook in his mouth , running along on three legs , that fourth foot flopping whenever the trap hit the ground , but running-and he escaped : looking back at Trapper with that trapped foot raised and the drag in his mouth . <p> Pulling hard on the oars . The far shore closer , now : close enough to see small blue flowers blooming on the bank . And the smell of the woods : her woods . <p> V <p> It 's spring , and bears are coming out of the earth . For twelve days they have staggered through the woods like drunk sailors . They ca n't quite wake up , and their eyesight-poor to begin with-is worse than ever . The bears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over ; they 're exceedingly dangerous at this time . Trapper moves through the woods with caution , head down , looking for Judith 's big , curved tracks . He allows himself to think of her breasts , which remind him of apples . Bears are staggering through the woods and rolling on their backs , trying to stand up straight , and Trapper says to one , " Brother , I know how you feel , " and passes right by it . He remembers that the Indians revered the grizzly so much that they would n't even speak its name , whether out in the woods hunting it or back in camp talking about it . Instead , they would give the bear goofy names like " Grandfather , " " Good Father , " " Worthy Old Man , " " Illustrious , " and even " The Master . " <p> Master , my ass , Trapper thinks , stepping around another wobbly bear just up from the earth . It is spitting up a small pile of sticky wet green leaves , having eaten too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He knows he should kill them and skin them out , but the hide 's no good for trading in the spring . <p> For a week he sees bears rolling drunk in the woods , trying to get oriented . <p> " You 're lucky , friend , " he says to one . " You 're going to get better . " Trapper 's still twitching . He has it firmly in his mind now that Judith-somehow  --  can save him . That she will lay her hand on his forehead , and the shakes will go away . <p> In Arizona , after making love to her , Trapper would get a washcloth and dip it in a basin of cool water . Then he would come to the bedside and draw it slowly up the length of Judith 's panting body , starting at her summer-dusty toes and drawing it slowly up her hot legs , over the mound of her sex , tickling , and like a sheet across her concave belly , and like a wet curtain across her breasts . Up to her chin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the wet washcloth . <p> It was too long ago . He can never get back to that . But he 's got to chase it . That feeling of not being weak . That feeling of being anything but weak . <p> Even numbness is better than being weak . <p> Trapper stops and rests often . He finds her tracks here and there : faint depressions in the moss . He suspects she is staying within this one forest-that it has become her new home ( Nol he thinks , Damn it , I am her homel ) and that she is reluctant to leave , to be driven off . He also thinks she wants to be trapped , if only so she can try to escape again . <p> There 's a strange wormy feeling in his mind , and he can hear a buzzing , like night katydids . I love my prey , he thinks , forcing himself to his feet . <p> Bear , lynx , and lobo all have a round , plump pad on each foot , but the older the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ball is finally all gone and no pad at all is left-just a flat space . <p> The female lynx has a shorter and smaller second toe on the hind foot than the male , and her front feet are a little rounder and neater than the male 's . She carries her young farther back in the body than any other wild animal . If she is heavy with kittens , the outside toes on both hind feet spread out . <p> Trapper studies the ground and tries to catch Judith 's scent . Near a small hot spring where he feels certain she 's been bathing , he finds one of her big club tracks in the moss and gets down and puts his nose in the depression and sniffs , closes his eyes and sniffs , but she 's clever , the sulfur odor of the spring confuses all scent , all instinct . Trapper has it in his mind that her beautiful shimmering yellow hair , which he so loved to brush , is a nest for static electricity , for glimmering ions leaving a magic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he concentrates hard enough on it , he thinks , he can follow this trail . And he 's tempted to track her that way-with passion , with desire : which he has n't felt in a long time . <p> Trapper wants to lunge through the woods , hunting her hair-trail with this new , ten-years-gone passion ; but he remembers how Uncle Harm taught him to hunt , and how he has always hunted-giving himself over more and more to the mindless , the barbaric , and shunning the mistakes of passion , regret , guilt . <p> " A hunter slipping up on a moose , " Uncle Harm had preachedhis face gouged and raked like the craters of the moon but invisible in the darkness of the back porch-Harm 's white linen suit all they could see on his rocking chair , and his white Panama hat- " will make the animal uneasy by ' concentrating ' his mind upon the animal . <p> " Those who would catch a woodsman of the old school asleep do well to come carelessly , " Uncle Harm said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things like " woodsmen of the old school . " Trapper had heard him refer to one grizzly as " Golden Friend of Fin and Forest " and had had to ask what the hell he was talking about . It was when Harm started getting really old , Trapper remembered , that he began to develop all the respect : all that Golden Friend shit . Trapper knew it for what it really was : fear . Coyote fear . <p> Still , there had never been a better trapper . <p> " A stealthy approach , " Harm had preached , " seems to establish some telepathic communication with the subconscious mind of one who lives with nature . This faculty is borrowed from the animals , and is common among Indians . " <p> Harm was a savage , Trapper thinks . He wore a fancy-ass suit in the evenings , but all he was was a savage . Would n't fool with doctors . If he got a wound-a cut of some sort-and it became infected , he would lie in the shallows of the creek , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and nibble away the afflicted flesh , and clean the wound in that way . <p> A savage , with a heart too hardened by killing , Trapper thinks . Flowers , Trapper thinks , women like flowers . This time I will keep fresh flowers on the table . <p> From the ridge above , standing in a grove of budding-out birch trees , Judith watches as her young-old husband moves in a slow circle around the hot springs , carefully setting leg-hold traps under the rotting leaves . She watches him crouch and sniff at her new-bathed tracks , watches his smashed hands touch them , watches him lower his nose to the tracks once more and sniff . Despite herself , Judith lifts her hand to her hair and touches it , strokes it once . <p> At night , she hears him howling in her woods . Her woods ! She feels the hairs on the back of her neck rising . <p> He 's trembly , but he knows he could outrun her , if only he could catch sight of her . Her scent is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catch her going up it ; Trapper 's legs are thick , like a bear 's , so that he goes faster charging uphill than downhill . <p> The Eskimos hunt birds with bolas-little balls of ivory or bone at the ends of strong sinew cords a yard or more long . The hunter whirls at least half a dozen over his head and hurls them among a flock of geese or ducks so that the balls will spread out in flight . One of the bolas is sure to tangle itself around the wing or limb of a bird and send it crashing to the ground . <p> Trapper fashions bolas in the afternoons , resting his tired legs , lying in wait by the hot spring . <p> Judith watches from the ridge , furious . She slips down to the river and has to wash her hair in the cold glacier-silt water . It 's not the same as her spring . <p> Trapper can sense Judith 's fury , and knows he 's being watched . He smiles . <p> Why wo n't he leave me alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; she thinks . <p> God , that Uncle Harm was a numb bastard , Trapper thinks as he whittles on the bolas . Trapper remembers a game he and Harm used to play-a game Harm taught him-called Sleep-a-Night-and-Die . <p> They 'd whittle long , slender barbed shafts of bone and fit them into a socket at the end of juniper arrows . Then they 'd sit on the porch and wait for some small animal to come out of the willows , a nose-wrinkling rabbit , a dusk-wary coyote , even a gentle doe . <p> They 'd fire their sleep-a-night-and-die arrows at the intended victim , proud to be killing not with the machinery of guns and traps , but just killing . <p> Shot into a deer or rabbit or coyote , the barbed point would separate from the arrow socket , floating free in the flesh , and go searching for some vital part with each fleeing step of the creature ; it would rankle and twist with each stride , ever enlarging and irritating the wound , until the animal died . <p> A myth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food to another of their kind , caught in a trap , to ease its hunger , to give comfort . Wolves , yes-he 'd seen that often-but never bears . <p> If she 's not coming to water at the hot springs , Trapper thinks one moonless night-his wormy mind barely moving in his sleep , like the slow coils of a snake on a cold day-then she must be going to the river . <p> He rises in the night , crosses the ridge , and sets some new traps and snares . Builds a deadfall , too : not too big-he does n't want to kill her , he says to himself , confused-but big enough , by damn , to hold her . <p> Then goes back to sleep : to dream of animals attacking him . <p> Judith wakes on the riverbank , listening to the spring sounds of geese heading back north-snow geese , Arctic geese . If Trapper approaches , she thinks , she 'll simply leap up and dive into the cold river and swim away . She 'll swim for a hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or die trying . The water is so cold . She does n't think she could make it-but she 'll try , if she has to . <p> At dawn she rises and looks at the river and considers building her own raft : leaving her woods . She listens to the river 's lovely roar , feels the great and terrible force , feels it in the gravel at her feet . Leans her head into the current , dips her head under , and washes her hair : scrubs the ions away . <p> All forests should have at least one man and one woman in them , Judith thinks as she washes her hair . They are on the same side of the river now , but there is still that other river that separates them - and it is no good . We spend our silly lives crossing back and forth over that river , she thinks , rather than swimming in it , being carried downstream in whatever manner the drifts and great force will take us . <p> All forests deserve one man and one woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has gone over to some other world , and this woman , she thinks-this woman , standing up and leaning her head back and squeezing the water out of her hair-is going back downstream . Maybe not all the way to Arizona , but somewhere : someplace . <p> The new birch leaves are rattling in the breeze . She will climb the ridge and look down on the poor , sick shell of her husband , the past of him , one more time . <p> How many others have fallen to Trapper in this manner , betrayed by curiosity and a moment 's hesitation , a tempering of what was previously brute fear and headlong , terrified flight ? He 's caught five hundred lynx by fastening a glittering strip of metal above the bare trap . And though it is not of his planning , it works this way for Judith ; while watching Trapper-that one last look-she does not pay enough attention to herself or where she is going , and walks right beneath his deadfall : bumps the branch holding it above her . <p> Despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has crushed her ; he hears the thump of the log landing on her , hears her cry-What was that ? he wonders . Lion ? Wolf ? Lynx ? Could it be her ? - and he starts up the ridge toward the sound , eager-hearted , young again . And caught under the deadfall , with her shoulder broken and her leg in a leather snare , waiting for him to approach , unable to twist and look back at the river below her but hearing it , hearing it , what Judith is thinking as she imagines his approach with the club is this : I know he loves me . <p> Maybe he 's changed , Judith thinks . She ca n't move a muscle . The river roars . Maybe he 's well , Judith thinks . <p> Then she thinks about the myths of bears versus the facts . She debates : freedom , or hope ? Quitting-flight-or pushing on ? <p> Does her freedom-river freedom-even exist ? <p> She gnaws at the snare . It takes her a long time , but she 's able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nowhere-that he still loves her is confounding her efforts . <p> The log 's so heavy . She ca n't lift it . With her broken shoulder she tunnels away at soft earth and then gravel , scoops out a depression barely deep enough for her to slither out from under the big log . <p> The river is just below . She hears Trapper coming up the other ridge , howling . Judith careens through the trees , running for the river , tripping and falling , her arm and shoulder sticking out crookedly like a bird 's crippled wing . Her big , curved feet keep tripping her , but she 's up and running each time she falls , the earth sending jolts of pain through her jaws and into her ears . <p> The diamond rushing waters of the river glitter . <p> There wo n't be time to build a raft . <p> She hits the water as she hit the window the night she busted out of the cabin , but this time he is right with her , on top of her , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She thrashes , broken-armed , like a bird : starts to strike at and bite him but sees , in a moment , in a glimpse-a passing shadow , passing wave of light-a thing almost like tenderness , even concern , in his face , and she does not strike or bite . She pauses , held in his grip . <p> She feels some part of her escape with the current-her other life , the mythical one . She feels too the other , or second , life-the real life , also just as mythical-the one he has in his grip once more . <p> " Listen , " he says . " I 'll be nice . I missed you . Listen , " he says , stroking her hair as if he means to scalp her . " Oh , I love you , " he says , and strokes her hair some more . <p> They fall back into being as they were before : as if caught in some cycle too powerful and terrible to escape : as if they might as well be trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tight on her wrist . He does n't get better , but he does n't die , either . They just settle into the soil and their lives again , like rotting trees , and the world passes over them . They keep on trapping things . <p> Judith dreams for a month or two of how things might have been if she 'd hit the river a step or two sooner , but then those dreams fade , as if they are far downstream now , or eroded , or forgotten . <p> I probably would have drowned , she thinks . I probably would not have made it . <p> She goes back to the old life , helping him tend traps . She feels cut in half , but strangely there is no pain . <p> " Say it again , " she tells him , nights when she thinks she must hit the window again at full stride : " Say that you love me . " <p> " Oh , I do , " he says , stroking her hair . " I do . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wrist . <p>
