<p> As a school board member in Wilmette District 39 who has been active for more than a decade in local public school policy , I found Vernon R. Louck Jr . ' s letter ( Dec. 7 ) lauding the dawn of a " golden age of education " dismaying , if pretty typical of the new partnership between big government and big business that forms one of the major roadblocks to real education reform today . <p> I find scant comfort in the fact that a few years will bring unilateral condemnation of yet another incarnation of trendy educational fads that had their origins in the 1930s , known as constructivism a la whole language , constructivism a la fuzzy math and experiential science , all emphasizing instructional process and child-centered models of teaching over core academic skills and knowledge . <p> I wonder if the scientists who were building Baxter labs in the 1950s would have felt comfortable with a physics class that helps kids " discover " the theory of velocity by building cars out of cardboard boxes and rubber bands or math teaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> All of this is brought to you by our Democratic president , who can not get the federal government 's sticky fingers into enough of our lives , with special funding by the Republican Congress that still is tiptoeing around Washington waiting for the right moment to begin acting like the winning party . <p> Parents are waking up , taking on schools , teachers unions and government bureaucracies  --  at times with very favorable results , such as the Wilmette schools , which achieve an excellent program and high test scores for significantly lower per-pupil spending than neighboring districts . <p> Businesses clearly have a problem with workers who are coming to jobs ill-prepared in the basic skills . Unfortunately , these same businesses have allowed themselves to be convinced that national testing , state standards and more and more money will make a difference . <p> The answer to better public education lies in a common sense approach to policy , controlled at the local level , closest to the consumer ; it is liberal in the breadth and depth of its curriculum , conservative in its close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the appropriate foundations are in place . <p> Eva Knowlton Sorock , Wilmette <p> Putting kids first <p> I agree with the thoughts of your editorial ( Dec. 3 ) , " Partial victory for kids , " on school funding , but I also believe that some clarification should be made regarding comments about the funding source for the legislation . <p> Your editorial says , " Rather than relying on a higher income tax as a more reliable source of school funding , this bill uses a more volatile approach . It raises existing taxes on cigarettes , phone calls and casino gambling receipts . " <p> The bill does not rely on the increase in these taxes to fund the education proposal passed by the Legislature . <p> The cornerstone of this legislation is a continuing appropriation that means that no matter what , Illinois schoolchildren will have their education funded at the foundation level of $ 4,225 the first year . <p> Illinois must allocate specific funds for debt payment and to fund pensions . Schoolchildren now will be included in that " must pay " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to $ 4,425 in 2001 . <p> While I and many other legislators in the Senate would have preferred to have voted for the governor 's legislation last spring to raise the income tax and provide the largest property tax relief measure in the history of our state , the Senate Republicans would not allow that vote to take place . <p> However , that roadblock should not diminish the importance of the legislation we have now passed . <p> State Sen. Arthur Berman <p> ( D-Chicago ) <p> Noxious fumes <p> There has been a lot of concern regarding the so-called greenhouse effect of our atmosphere due to the terrific pollution caused by motor vehicles and other sources of fossil fuel burning . <p> When I see that so many European large cities operate very clean and efficient streetcars and ; or trolley buses , I wonder why our supposedly so advanced society continues to use the biggest polluters of all : diesel city buses . <p> Not only are Chicago 's buses among the worst polluters of our air , but the maintenance costs of the diesel engines , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bus lines possible be converted to trolley buses . <p> That would be a good beginning to curb the causes of the greenhouse effect . <p> Peter J. Botzek , Rogers Park <p> Star performers <p> I applaud and wholeheartedly agree with Dennis Byrne 's column ( Nov. 13 ) and the letter by Sgt. Rob Sarnowski ( Nov. 30 ) regarding our police force . <p> A couple of bad apples and we tend to label them all . Just think about what they face in their everyday jobs : verbal and physical abuse , deceit , threats by criminals and neglect and abuse of children . <p> There certainly are bad apples among the general public , yet do we condemn all for few ? Think for a minute what we would do without the police , and then perhaps we would commend them rather than condemn . I for one , am grateful for Chicago 's Finest ! <p> Dorothy Farnsworth , <p> Portage Park <p> Viva la Cuba ! <p> Jorge Mas Canosa , the multimillionaire leader of the Cuban-American exiles , is dead at 58 ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that no one can take his place and that there is a growing demand in the country and in the Miami area for a change of policy toward Cuba , ending our embargo . <p> Mas Canosa , with his obsession against his former homeland , has cost this country millions of dollars in taxes supporting the failed TV Marti and Radio Marti . It has cost Americans millions of dollars in trade and thousands of jobs . <p> It is time we re-asserted our right to travel and not allow a few dissident Cubans in Miami to determine our Caribbean foreign policy . If we can send food and medicine all over the world , and fly our computers everywhere , we should do the same for a country of 11 million . <p> Mas Canosa is dead . Our discredited foreign policy should be buried with him . <p> R.W. Mostek , <p> Social Action Committee , <p> Third Unitarian Church , <p> Austin <p> Freedom of choice <p> I am writing concerning the issue of religion in public schools . <p> Growing up in a Christian school , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I believe that this participation was good in a Christian school ; however , in public schools religion should not be part of the required aspects . In public schools there are numerous religions . In order to cater to everyone 's needs it is best to keep religion out . <p> Forcing religion upon students in a public school atmosphere is like forcing vegetarians to eat meat . Religion , like vegetarianism , is a choice , a choice not shared commonly by everyone . <p> Sarah Mapes , North Park <p> Bambi run amok <p> So Gregory Becvar ( Letters , Dec. 4 ) thinks deer conspiring to " bolt in front of oncoming vehicles " are the problem in Highland Park ? <p> Here 's a newsflash : Cars hit deer . Deer do n't aim at cars . What 's more , no deer involved in a deer-auto accident were ever found to be intoxicated , using a cellular phone , eating a hamburger and fries , putting on makeup , shaving , exceeding speed limits or yelling at their wife ; kids when the impact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> Robert D. Dominiec , Lake View <p> By e-mail <p> Every day 's a holiday <p> I agree with Phillis C. Rack ( Letters , Nov. 24 ) , who wants to move Halloween to September and Thanksgiving Day to early November for the sake of convenience and to make things easier for merchants . <p> Why stop there ? <p> Labor Day should be moved to June because the weather 's better . <p> Celebrate both the Fourth of July and and Cinco de Mayo on the same day in March  --  except keep their names . <p> Forget religious calendars and have Easter in August because there are no holidays in August , and those light spring dresses will be more comfortable then . <p> Change Memorial Day to Feb. 29 so we 'd only have to observe it every four years . Merchants never do much with Memorial Day anyway . <p> As for Valentine 's , Groundhog , Secretaries , Sweetest , St. Patrick 's and another other miscellaneous " Day "  --  skip them altogether ! Talk to the merchants first , though . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mondays are a bad way to start the week . Switch Monday with Thursday , where we can handle it better . And then maybe put the weekend in the middle when we can really use the break . Of course , we 'll have to change " weekend " to another name . But T.G.I. Fridays could still keep their sign . <p> Spring is wasted right after winter . It 's always dragging on anyway . Let 's skip spring and go straight to summer . We 'd have spring after fall , when we 'd appreciate it . <p> 7:30 a.m. is a very hectic time in my house , so I propose moving it closer to noon when I 'm more comfortable . <p> You know , with a few minor changes , time itself will be a better place in which to live , and be a merchant  --  especially a calendar merchant . Convenience and the ability to keep store shelves stocked are , after all , what holiday traditions are all about . <p> Walter Michka , Downers Grove
