They 're the most eagerly awaited audio formats to come along in a decade  --  that is , if you consider the compact disc the last generational jump in technology . The digital compact cassette ( DCC ) developed by Philips relegates analog cassette hiss and noise-reduction schemes to instant obsolescence  --  yet the decks can still play your old cassettes . The sleek MiniDisc ( MD ) alternative developed by Sony reads and writes audio data to what looks like a tiny computer disc ; in portable form it 's been likened to carrying a laser around in your pocket . And both of these new digital formats support models that play as well as record . Because these stereo components are radically different from the " me-too " products of the past , DCC and MD are attracting everyone from audiophiles to the merely curious . With production units finally reaching stores , I needed to get my ears wet . I decided to make some recordings and play them back to determine which format sounded best  --  and how they compared with the sound of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom line : Is either format sufficiently compelling to justify yet another music collection ? There 's an important distinction between DCC and MD . DCC , the tape format originating in Europe , debuted for play on tabletop hi-fi deck components ; the first generation of MD , the recordable disc format from Japan , is packaged as small portable machines with headphones and decks for cars . Both new formats use data-compression techniques to squeeze digital audio signals onto compact recording media without seriously distorting sound quality . That 's what their inventors intended , anyway ( see How Digital Audio Compression Works ) . To discover how well they succeeded , I listened to one MD and several DCC machines , comparing recordings made from high-end compact-disc components with sound from the original CDs . Because it 's an optical disc , MD offers speedy random access and is more durable than tape  --  capable of rerecording over the same disc up to a million times . It 's also housed in a much smaller shell . Compared with DCC , MD 's protective disc caddy is 1.25 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ format ahead on the hardware miniaturization curve . Although not physically compatible with the CD format , both MD and DCC can record music from CDs through either digital or analog inputs . Following an agreement worked out with the music industry , an anti-copying circuit called the Serial Copy Management System prevents digitally made copies from being copied again , although you may still use the analog connection to create another generation . In my tests , DCC lived up to the hype , sounding excellent indeed . Though MD was marginally coarser on a few test selections , the difference was not great enough to be audible during its intended use as a portable with headphones or in a car . Both are clear and good enough for home use by most listeners , excluding discriminating audiophiles . The digital compact cassette is being positioned as heir to the analog compact cassette  --  known simply as the cassette . Philips invented the cassette in the early 1960s for voice recording and later helped adapt it for musical use with new tape formulations and Dolby noise reduction . Until two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both CDs and LPs . ( CDs have since assumed the lead . ) DCC decks play analog cassettes though they record only in the new digital format , which contains nine narrow tape tracks in each direction " The Second Coming of the Digital Cassette , " June ' ' 91 . Thus , you can use one machine to listen to both your analog tape collection and your new digital tapes . Philips , Technics , and others make DCC-compatible hardware . I tested DCC machines from Philips , Technics , and Radio Shack . Philips ' DCC 900 ( $799 ) is symmetrical in appearance , with the disc drawer in the middle flanked by recording-related controls at left and right ; an angled panel at the bottom contains basic tape-transport controls . The Technics RS-DC10 ( $999 ) appears identical , with two minor omissions  --  a " CD sync " button and an " auto " position on the input-select knob . Radio Shack 's Optimus DCT-2000 ( $699 ) maintains the balanced look but enlarges the transport controls and moves them to the upper right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flipdown door at the bottom . Marantz , a Philips brand , marches to a different drummer by placing the disc drawer in the upper left , as on most CD players . The DD-92 ( $1,199 ) and DD-82 ( $1,099 ) can both encode up to 18 bits ' worth of information for greater dynamic range  --  more than the CD format 's 16 bits . Although no 18-bit prerecorded formats are available , the extra dynamic range possible with the Marantz decks may enhance microphone recordings . ( You will need a mixer since the decks do not have a microphone jack . ) The 18-bits may also enhance DCC tapes of LPs played on first-rate turntables , or any other high-quality analog signal . Audiophiles have long complained that 16-bit formats such as CDs are too coarse at quiet musical moments because too few bits are allocated to low-level passages . The MiniDisc is an altogether different animal . This petite 2.5-inch magneto-optical disc records with a combination of laser beam and magnetic head . The laser heats a spot on the disc to about 400(deg)F . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the disc , imprints the audio signal " Pocket-size Recorder Plays Music on a MiniDisc , " Aug. ' ' 91 . A slightly different type of polycarbonate disc is used for prerecorded titles . Sony 's three MD units include the portable recording ( MZ-1 , $750 ) and play-only ( MZ-2P , $550 ) models , plus a car player that handles more than one disc ( MDX-U1 , $980 ) . Sony recently announced its first MD home deck , the $1,000 MDS-101 . Sanyo and Sharp have shown prototypes of MD units that are smaller than any of Sony 's . Aiwa has introduced its $800 portable MD player/recorder , the AMD-100 , and Denon plans a play-only portable MD . The audio system I used for DCC comparison tests included a Pioneer PD-41 CD player  --  used solely as a " transport " to produce a digital output from a CD  --  and a Theta DS Pro Basic II , a high-end digital-to-analog converter . Avalon Avatar speakers were connected to a NAD 2400 amplifier and 1300 preamplifier . Digital interconnects were provided by Monster Cable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wire . I patched the Pioneer CD player into each DCC deck with an optical cable and recorded the same six items on separate tapes : audio test signals from the Denon Audio Technical CD , plus five musical selections  --  including voice and acoustic guitar , voice backed by a large band , a selection from a small jazz group , a brute-force rock song , and a movement from a piano concerto with full orchestra . Recording with DCC decks may faze beginners . They 're sophisticated machines , more like VCRs than average cassette decks . The " append " function is crucial to the recording process  --  this unfamiliar control prepares new blanks for recording . On a partly recorded blank it also searches for the end of the previous recording and poises the recording head to begin a new one . DCC also works a bit like a CD player in that it marks and numbers the beginning of each selection , so skipping tracks is easy , although a CD player  --  like an MD player  --  only takes a few seconds to switch songs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Remote control is a welcome convenience in DCC  --  most analog tape decks do n't offer a remote . To put DCC and CD on a level playing field , I fed the digital outputs of the Philips DCC deck and Pioneer CD transport into the Theta converter , toggle-switching between them on the Theta . This was a tough challenge for DCC , since the Theta would tirelessly scour its digital output for every morsel of detail . DCC handily outperformed the analog cassette format , in which even the best machines roll off extremely low and high frequencies . DCC played back test tones  --  from a rumbling 40 hertz to an inaudibly high 19,999 hertz  --  at precisely the same volume at which they were recorded . What I could n't hear I could see on the display meter during playback . With music , the CDs and DCC recordings seemed indistinguishable most of the time . Frequency response seemed perfect throughout the selections , vocal and instrumental timbres sounded right , and subtle spatial cues were intact . When textures became complex  --  during the orchestral selection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  DCC might have been slightly coarser , but the difference was so meager it could have been imaginary . It is fair to conclude that DCC sounds at least as accurate as a good CD player . Repeating the comparison using Radio Shack 's Optimus deck produced similar results . A tape made on the Technics unit played on the other machines with no interchange problems ; prerecorded analog tapes also sounded fine . All DCC decks provide both Dolby B and C noise reduction . My methodology had to change for the MD model . Digital connecters on Sony 's MD recorder and Theta 's converter are not compatible  --  the former is optical , the latter , coaxial  --  so I could n't compare digital inputs coming out of the same converter . Instead I compared the MD with the Pioneer/Theta equipment , both functioning independently , and added another compact disc reference  --  the JVC XL- , an excellent CD portable  --  with similar power supplies and digital-to-analog converters of comparable quality . MD efficiently reproduced the test tones  --  no surprise , since its adaptive circuitry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was the music that revealed MD 's basic personality . MD was not as smooth as the Theta converter ( admittedly , a classic Bambi vs . Godzilla confrontation ) . On a simple recording with voice and acoustic guitar , it was easy to spot noise and grain in vocal timbres . In the piano concerto , MD cleanly reproduced the piano , but Theta 's high-end subtlety was superior in loud passages with string instruments . MD PORTABILITY When the JVC portable CD player became the reference for comparison , MD sounded closer to CD , albeit not identical in most cases . It slightly elevated high frequencies on well-recorded punk and blues-rock tracks , raising voices above the mix , but a ' ' 50s jazz selection showed no major differences . Taken together , the five musical selections revealed MD 's sonic signature , which boosts high-frequency areas where vocal overtones reside  --  emphasizing clarity of voices at the expense of overall clarity . Though the effect is usually audible through a top-notch home system , it is n't necessarily crude on MD . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be an advantage in a portable , making lyrics easier to decipher above ambient noise ; the difference in tonal balance would be hard to hear through headphones . Sony has maintained that MD is not intended to outshine the CD but to supplement it , for the most part , in portable settings . But the company wo n't be alone for long when it debuts a home deck this month ; Sanyo expects to ship a home MD recorder by the end of this year and Pioneer 's version will ship sometime next year . I took the MD unit for a stroll , listening to it on the way to a Manhattan doctor 's office and in a restaurant . Even if I 'd had a DCC portable to compare , ambient noise would have overwhelmed any distinctions . The MD sounded like a portable CD player , but it also weighed as much  --  1.5 pounds with battery . MD 's shockproof memory , achieved by continually storing ten seconds ' worth of audio in solid-state memory , also makes it more portable . Jerking the Sony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skip . It is n't likely that you 'll judge audio products by sound quality alone ; other factors also play a role . DCC has the advantage in recording time  --  at least for now . MD records 60 to 74 minutes , whereas DCC will debut with blanks of 60 to 90 minutes and eventually be extended to 120 minutes . MD 's 74 minutes , however , are uninterrupted ; in fact , MD machines can record a selection on separate parts of a disc and play it back continuously . Those taping with DCC still have to worry about flipping the tape in 30 to 45 minutes , as I discovered when a favorite Johannes Brahms piano-concerto movement got caught  --  and sliced  --  between sides A and B. And DCC 's thin-film tape heads , which are not exposed , must be cleaned with a special cleaning cassette . But MD 's dominance in portability wo n't last long . Panasonic and Philips recently announced DCC play-only portables that will be available this summer  --  and one of Panasonic 's models will fit in the palm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play-only portables will each list for $549 . ( Panasonic says it does n't have firm plans for a play/record DCC portable . ) In August , Panasonic also expects to deliver a car unit , the CQDC1 , for about $1,000 . Given the gap in the size of recording media , however , MD is likely to maintain its lead in miniaturization . MORE DCC TITLES Prerecorded albums are available in each format . The DCC camp claims the lead with about 500 releases while Sony says there are some 300 titles on MD as of early this year . In contrast , the only other widely distributed digital-recording format , digital audio tape ( DAT ) , has practically no prerecorded titles in stores . Sony and Philips both own large recording companies and have attracted support from other major labels , which have been pacified by both the anticopying circuit and an agreement to pay royalty taxes on recording decks and blank media . Both formats must compete with the nearly forgotten DAT , which records 120 minutes of 16-bit digital sound with no data reduction or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' 89 . The least expensive DAT decks are competitively priced , and today 's DAT portables are quite compact . Another potential competitor , the recordable CD , is nowhere near fruition . Another consideration in weighing the need for a DCC or MD system is that analog tape could still dominate Walkman-type and car audio uses for years to come . As long as you can buy a better-than-average analog tape deck for $200 or $300 and high-quality blank cassettes for a couple of bucks  --  and get great-sounding results from recordings off a CD  --  you may be tempted to avoid the expense of either DCC or MD players . Other important distinctions between DCC and MD include DCC 's play-only compatibility with analog cassettes  --  a powerful incentive to listeners with large cassette collections ; for DCC to be truly compatible , however , it should also provide an option to dub analog cassettes . Since DCC manufacturers did n't offer a battery option when this was written , it may seem unfair to criticize the MZ-1 's untethered operating time . Nevertheless , Sony says that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for about 75 minutes of playback or 60 minutes of recording time . That nearly 1:1 ratio seems awfully constraining if you were hoping to use the MZ-1 without alternating current for a couple of hours . The disc format is clearly superior to tape in terms of random access  --  you never have to rewind or fast-forward an MD . Not only can you jump from one song to another almost instantly , but if you want to record over a track at the beginning of the disc , you do n't have to worry about erasing part of the next selection . With an MD , as long as there 's blank space or an area designated for erasure elsewhere on the disc , the data can be stored . Tape is n't as flexible : For example , look at how rapidly floppy and hard drives eclipsed the need for a cassette port on the original IBM PC . Finally , MDs are likely to be more durable  --  even if left on a hot dashboard . SOUND CHOICE So what 's the verdict on this first generation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that it accommodates your old cassettes may be just enough of an enticement . And DCC sounds better than MD when heard through a high-end audio system in the home , coming very close to CD sound quality . Yet when it comes to playing DCC and MD in less controlled settings , there 's very little noticeable difference between the formats . MD 's big advantages are the disc 's random access and durability and , for now , the hardware 's portability . But as MDs begin to move into the living room and DCCs hit the road , differences based on locale will disappear . These formats are proof that audio technology has never been more interesting or exciting . HOW DIGITAL AUDIO COMPRESSION WORKS In a compact-disc digital recording , sound is converted into billions of numbers . This digital information is encoded onto a CD and then processed at about 1.4 million bits per second in order to make music for your ears . Such a vast amount of information ca n't be compressed onto a digital compact cassette ( DCC ) or a MiniDisc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same way as a CD , the playing time would only be about 15 minutes . The task for engineers : reduce the amount of digital information encoded on discs or tapes while preserving digital sound quality . To reduce the bit density , sound engineers rely on psychoacoustics  --  the study of how sounds are heard . Both DCC and MD formats take advantage of two limitations of human hearing : The ear only hears sounds within certain frequencies , and if two sounds occur simultaneously , the ear will hear the louder of the sounds . For example , if there 's a teapot shrieking and a fly buzzing , the softer noise of the fly is masked . By some estimates , 73 percent of a Mozart wind-ensemble piece is masked and inaudible to the average listener . DCC can encode 25 percent of the information contained on a CD , and MD can record just 20 percent  --  yet the sound quality on either format is said to approach that of a CD . How can this be ? DCC uses a coding method called Precision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adaptive Transform Acoustic Coding ( ATRAC ) . Both technologies encode only those sounds that the ear can hear ; however , the way the sound information is distributed across the frequency bands is achieved in different ways . After analyzing sound patterns and discarding data that would be inaudible , the PASC data compression scheme distributes the bits across 32 frequency bands of the same width  --  each about 750 hertz wide , which covers the 20-kilohertz range of human hearing . The PASC processor then samples , or makes an analysis of the sound , using an average of four bits per sample . In a pristine CD recording , 16 bits are used to describe each and every sound sample . ATRAC filters the music signal into 52 bands that vary in width , using larger bands for those frequencies that are audible to the human ear . As the digital information is sampled , more bits are allocated to these more " critical " frequencies depending on the song . To the average listener , these differences in distribution of the bits are inaudible . <p>  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
