A proposed $400 million settlement by the Agriculture Department to pay for decades of racial discrimination was attacked by Black farmers as inadequate . At a federal court hearing on the settlement in the nation 's capital , hundreds of the affected farmers took offense at what they described as " a skimpy offering " and staged a protest outside U.S. District Court urging Judge Paul Friedman " not to allow such incomplete and defective relief to become record . " The deal would allow farmers with less documented evidence to take a $50,000 tax-free payment and have their government debts forgiven . Farmers with more evidence could opt to go before an independent arbitrator to seek larger damages . Photograph // Only weeks before , many farmers favored the Agriculture Department 's formula to redress the bias which had almost wiped out the nation 's once prosperous Black farming community . However , many plaintiffs say that after reading the agreement they 're not sure they are getting a fair deal .

" Some of the things farmers mentioned to be included in the settlement are a review board to look over the arbitrator 's rulings and the firing of department officials in the counties that participated in the discrimination . Judge Friedman explained that he could not modify the settlement . " There are things I can do and pressure that I can bring to bear . But I think everybody has to understand that all I can do is approve the settlement of the lawsuit or not approve the settlement of the lawsuit . " He did not specify when he would issue a final decision on the settlement .

Holder , the department 's No. 2 official , told a House Judiciary subcommittee , " The Department of Justice has reluctantly come to the conclusion that the structural flaws ( in the act ) can not be fixed . " The independent counsel statute , which was created in 1978 as an answer to the public 's post-Watergate mistrust of government , will expire June 31 unless Congress reauthorizes the law . The consensus on Capitol Hill seems to be that it was a well-intentioned law that has gone awry . Photograph A Deputy U.S. Attorney Gen. Eric Holder testifies that the Justice Department stands against re-enactment of the independent counsel law . // The main question now is whether enough members of Congress believe the independent counsel law is worth the effort of re-writing . Holder added that the Justice Department concluded that the law has " failed to accomplish its primary goal : the enhancement of confidence in the rule of law by the American people ... The act was supposed to increase trust in our government . In fact , it has diminished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bennett , concurred with the Justice Department 's analysis . He said " the counsel law has become a vehicle for subjecting ( public officials ) , and those around them , to seemingly perpetual scrutiny more intense than any private citizen would have to endure . " At JET press time , the Senate was continuing its debate on the fate of the statute .
