<p> In the center of town and the heart of an area once so vibrant it was called the Miracle Mile is a shopping and entertainment district that 's growing and changing , but where diversity and preservation still rule the day . <p> Denver 's Central Broadway is a hopscotch of mismatched restaurants and bars , bookshops , vintage clothing stores , furniture stores , galleries and other specialty and discount shops . <p> There 's new and old , eccentric and practical . <p> Some might call it ' seedy . ' <p> And that 's the way the neighborhood likes it . <p> Yes , neighborhood . <p> Flanked by the Baker area to the west and West Washington Park to the east , central Broadway - between Sixth and Alameda avenues - has become a tight community where many homes are occupied by their owners , merchants are residents and locals walk to the nearby stores and restaurants . <p> ' In the last five to 10 years , the biggest difference in the area is a sense of community . There is ownership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Broadway Business Association , and pastor of the Mission Denver Christian Church at 25 E. Ellsworth Ave . <p> The DBBA formed about two years ago , an evolution of the Broadway Merchants Association . Ramsey said the new group bridges the residential and commercial communities and better addresses the area 's growth . <p> Sense of community <p> ' I think a lot of the hub businesses , The Hornet , the Mayan , and some of the newer businesses like Key Bank have really cultivated a sense of community among the smaller merchants , and good alliances with the neighborhood , ' said Ramsey . <p> Another mainstay business in the area just got some unwanted attention when the Denver district attorney 's office on Tuesday charged Ichabod 's Books , a used-book store , with racketeering and theft by receiving . Prosecutors said a two-year investigation found that book thieves repeatedly sold stolen books to Ichabod 's . <p> When the new growth started here depends on whom you talk to . But most agree the momentum picked up about four years ago , when several merchants opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including The Hornet restaurant and bar and As You Wish , a paint-it-yourself pottery studio . <p> Consistent growth <p> These and many other businesses along the strip have seen consistent growth in recent years . The Hornet 's sales have increased 20 percent annually since it opened in 1995 , and Manos Folk Art and Imports , across the street , is having its best Christmas in all its 10 years there . <p> Merchants say it 's diversity that defines the area and also drives business . <p> There 's young and old , rich and poor and an assortment of ethnicities and personalities on central Broadway . <p> Shoppers come come from afar , seeking a specific out-of-print book or the trendiest second-hand apparel . Others hustle by on foot , busy with everyday errands . And still others just wander . <p> Body wave or body piercing , your pick . Grab a steaming-hot slice at Famous Pizza , or dine Louisiana style at Cafe Evangeline . Gay bars , blue-collar bars and yuppie bars . <p> ' We see the lower echelons of society through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's kept us interested here . ' <p> What strings it all together is the eccentric and creative . <p> ' The area is home to a lot artists and other creative people , ' said Chris Tait , who owns Decade , a vintage and specialty gift shop at 58 S. Broadway . She and her husband opened the shop two years ago and have lived in the area a while longer . <p> ' The majority of my customers do n't even go to the Cherry Creek mall . They are looking for something unique , ' added Tait . Crystal Sharp , who last month opened She She , a womens boutique , likes the area because ' you 're always going to find something really different . Since I sort of match that description , it just became really appealing for me . ' <p> The store , at 5 East Bayaud , offers apparel and accessories handmade by Sharp , as well as jewelry from two local artists . Dresswear is displayed like pieces in a gallery , where customers can buy what they see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She , said Sharp is the price , which is below many custom-made fashions . <p> She also likes central Broadway for another reason . <p> ' The rent , it 's just so cheap , ' said Sharp . ' The landlady has owned the building for quite some time . ' <p> Her situation is no exception . Most merchants say rents are fair . Part of the reason may be that some property owners bought into the area many years ago . <p> Michael ' M.J. ' Baum , who 50 years ago bought the four-story building at the northeast corner of 1st Avenue and Broadway , has seen his investment has come full circle . <p> The building was his first purchase in his long-time career in real estate investment . The building housed first-floor retail shops , Walgreens and Singer Sewing at the time . <p> He opened the First Avenue Hotel on the levels above , but after a healthy run as a low-cost home for the elderly , he closed it down due to the number of transients trying to come into the building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming into the area , Baum remodeled the first level , and now leases to Manos , As You Wish and the Me L Yu and Rule galleries . <p> The upper levels remain closed . Baum has received offers galore , mostly from developers who envision office space or condos . <p> But Baum said he 'll take his time deciding how to use that space . <p> ' That 's such a gorgeous building it really should be preserved and have the highest and best use possible to enhance the entire commercial area there , ' added Baum . <p> Across from his building is a theater that is one of the area 's oldest landmarks and possibly its greatest strength . <p> ' A blessing for us is the Mayan Theatre , ' said Dave French , one of the owners at The Hornet . ' It continues to have great movies . That art scene is our scene . ' He said The Hornet 's sales jumped 10 percent during the run of ' Blair Witch Project ' earlier this year . <p> Natasha Hoover of Landmark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people during the last few years are showing interest in the Mayan 's film genre : independent and alternative . <p> Manos owners Ted Thomas and Paula Crane selected their space because it is across from the Mayan . <p> ' That 's what drives the neighborhood , ' said Thomas . <p> The Mayan has seen both good times and bad . It opened with a bang in 1930 , a rebirth of the Queen Theater , which was destroyed by fire . <p> The timing was perfect . During the 1920s , there was wave of retail and entertainment growth along the roughly mile-long strip of Broadway between Cherry Creek on the north and Exposition Avenue on the south , said Denver historian Phil Goodstein . <p> The area was called the Miracle Mile . <p> Department stores , including J.C . Penney and Montgomery Ward , dime stores and specialty shops were built . The nightlife also was hopping , said Goodstein , with bars , pool halls and other theaters . There was a baseball park , too . But the area started to decline after World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming of suburban shopping centers , and flight to suburbia in the mid-1960s to early 1970s , ' added Goodstein . Many of the stores moved out . <p> In the late 1970s and early 1980s , the area saw a heavy gay influx , and the area was in transition from renters to homeowners , said Goodstein . <p> This era also saw a rise in pornography shops and a huge wave of transients . <p> The Mayan was set for demolition in 1983 by the Union Bank &; Trust , which owned the building . But preservation efforts resulted in the site becoming a city landmark . It was renovated with in 1986 . <p> Perhaps it was the Mayan 's new lease on life , combined with the growing number of homeowners and improving economy in the early 1990s , that helped the area recover . <p> The Mayan 's renovation was funded by Dick Landon of Landon Associates , who this year again came to the rescue on another historical project on central Broadway . <p> The previous owners of Apple Plumbing , at 6th Avenue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rite-Aid store , but groups lobbied for its historical preservation and Landon stepped in to fund renovation . <p> Built in 1932 as the Leeman Auto showroom , the structure will soon be occupied by a flock of newcomers : Chipotle Mexican Grill , Jamba Juice , Ocean Fresh Fish , Noodles &; Co. , Starbucks Coffee and Steak Escape . On the south side of the building , a Car Toys store opened last month . <p> Along with residents and commuters , these new stores likely will attract guests from the new Marriott hotel , under construction at the site of the old A.B . Hirschfield Press building , at 7th Avenue and Acoma Street . Also in the planning stages is a loft project at 3rd and Lincoln avenues , to include first-floor retail space . <p> Another loft project is approaching completion at 2nd and Lincoln avenues . <p> Could the area grow too much and lose its scruffy character , perhaps becoming the next Larimer Square or LoDo ? <p> Perhaps , some say , but not any time soon . <p> ' It 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has not been complete gentrification , ' said Ramsey . ' A lot of what 's gone on Broadway has gone on for the last 100 years . ' And part of what makes central Broadway an eclectic mix - gay bars , adult theaters and offbeat shops - balances out newer elements of the mix . <p> ' I do n't see it becoming mainstream ever , ' said Sharp . ' The area 's turnaround will attract some people . But it 's not going to have Coors Field next to it . ' <p> Ramsey agrees . <p> ' They had to manufacture housing in the LoDo area . These are houses here that have existed 100 years . You 're not going to tear those down and build a Wal-Mart. '
