The 100,000-acre Baca Ranch ( looking cast , above ) is comprised of numerous valles , or basins , collectively called the Valles Caldera . Trout streams ( left ) course through the ranch , which is home to more than 6,000 elk ( below ) . // COVERING NEARLY 100,000 acres , the Baca Ranch in the Jemez Mountains of northern New Mexico is not just another pretty piece of Rocky Mountain real estate . After nearly 140 years in private ownership , the ranch-just an hour from either Albuquerque or Santa Fe-is at the center of a conflict that pits sportsmen and conservationists against the pro-development forces and big-money interests that are snapping up ranch land all over the West . Situated on one of the largest volcanic craters in the nation , the Baca , as the ranch is called , is geologically unique . In the million years since the lava has cooled , the land has evolved into a patchwork of huge meadows broken by tall pines that together support a variety of wildlife , including a resident herd of at least 6,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from State Highway 4 , which cuts across the southeast corner of the ranch , into the magnificent sweep of the Valle Grande . No TRESPASSING signs dot the barbed wire fence . The Baca holds many other valles , or basins , known collectively as the Valles Caldera . Each valle drains into its own gorgeous meadow stream swirling with trout . Legislation pending in Congress would buy the ranch and turn it over to the U.S. Forest Service . But the success of the effort is far from certain . The fate of the Baca Ranch stands as a microcosm for the future of the West : Public or private ? Open or closed ? Accessible to rich or poor ? Predictably , different people have different answers . Sportsmen ca n't wait to set foot on the Baca . Environmental groups are pushing for protection , even while some warn that the Forest Service-with its " multiple use " mandate that favors logging and grazing-is n't to be trusted with such a gem . Ranchers and many New Mexico politicians , meanwhile , curl their lips on principle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the West . But despite differences in philosophy , nearly everyone agrees that the Baca is unique and needs to be preserved one way or another . The question remains , however , whether such strong sentiment will translate into political action in time to protect this magnificent ranch from being sold off and possibly cut into " ranchettes . " If Congress ca n't hammer out a deal to buy the ranch this year , the Dunigan family of Abilene , Texas , owners of the ranch for the past 35 years , have said they 'll sell it on the open market . Over the coming months , the will of the public will decide if the future sees this ranch locked up as yet another playground for the super rich , or preserved as public land for future generations of common Americans looking for a place to camp , hunt , and fish . DUELING SENATORS . " It 's important that this get done , and the time is right , " says U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman ( D-NM ) , who introduced legislation to buy the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... the opportunity will be lost . " Bingaman is n't one to cry wolf on environmental issues . He grew up in Silver City , a mining town in an area of southern New Mexico populated by fiercely independent ranchers . But now , Bingaman says getting the Baca Ranch into public hands is one battle worth fighting . " I just hate the thought of a 7-Eleven in the Valle Grande with trailer parks all around it , " he says . Photograph The Baca , which has been in private ownership for almost 140 years , covers one of the largest volcanic craters in the nation . // Although appraisals are n't complete , estimates on the purchase price of the ranch range as high as $200 million . President Bill Clinton , who flew over the ranch on a New Mexico visit last winter , is pushing to earmark $40 million from the federal Land and Water Conservation Fund-which collects money from offshore oil drillingfor the Baca purchase . Republicans in Congress at first bristled at Clinton 's spending recommendations , saying his " wish list " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you need an answer right now , let me say I do n't favor the purchase of the Baca at this time , " said Senator Pete Domenici ( R-NM ) last summer . Domenici holds the gavel as chairman of the Senate Budget Committee . " First of all , I have no idea what it will cost , and I 've heard everything from $75 million to $200 million , " Domenici said . " I think it 's not right to either build false hope or false momentum when the price may not be something that I think we can afford . " But late last July , after a cross-country trip with Clinton aboard Air Force One , Domenici announced a " potentially major breakthrough " on the possibility of federal acquisition of the Baca-even though an appraisal still had not been completed . Provided that the federal government could negotiate an acceptable purchase price , Domenici pledged to do what he could to ramrod legislation through Congress to free up the $40 million from the Land and Water Conservation Fund in addition to other money necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ White House will create a trust to manage the Baca . The trust would be owned by the government , but managed by citizens appointed by the President . The trust would ensure continued limited logging and grazing on the ranch , while also managing it for hunting , fishing , and other recreation . In exchange for Domenici 's support , the White House agreed to step up efforts to sell off federal land already deemed surplus by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management . More than 850,000 acres of such land have been identified in New Mexico , the senator has said . TYCOON RANCHERS James " Pat " Dunigan , who bought the ranch in 1962 , had been interested in selling it to the federal government before his death in 1980 . Today his three sons own the ranch . The middle son , Andy Dunigan , age 33 , says his family has always been open to the prospect of a federal purchase of the ranch , but said that during the Reagan and Bush years of the 1980s , a deal would not have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to terms this year , Dunigan says he and his brothers are sure they can find interested buyers on the open market . The country has seen the creation of enormous new wealth in telecommunications and other high-tech industries recently , Dunigan notes . The resulting new breed of the ultrawealthy has turned its attention to buying trophy ranches in the West . And Dunigan says the Baca-a block of land roughly 12 miles on each side-is big enough to place his family on the list of the top 100 landowners in the nation . " They 've bought almost everything known to man , and the one thing they 're not making any more of is land , " Dunigan says . One such techno-tycoon with an apparently insatiable appetite for western land is Ted Turner ( see sidebar ) , whose holdings in New Mexico , at last count , hovered around 1 million acres . Turner 's most recent acquisition in New Mexico , and the one that causes natives here the most jealousy and regret , was his purchase of some 500,000 acres known as the Vermejo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colorado , Vermejo holds one of the best elk herds in the nation and the fishing is legendary . Of course , any would-be sportsman has to be prepared to pay big money to set foot there . What makes Turner 's ownership of Vermejo particularly galling to New Mexicans is that both the state and federal governments dropped the ball on a chance to buy it in the early 1970s for the comparatively paltry sum of $26 million . Just a few years later , the federal government gave former owner Pennzoil Corporation a tax break of more than $20 million in exchange for donating 100,000 acres-just 20 percent of the original ranch-to the Forest Service . Today , supporters of the proposed federal purchase of the Baca Ranch point to Vermejo as exactly the sort of lost opportunity that should not be allowed to occur again . " There 's a real advantage to having this kind of property , this property , in public use , " Sen. Bingaman says of the Baca Ranch . " You ca n't expect Ted Turner to open up his ranches to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's not a realistic expectation ; he 's earned the money to buy those ranches . But that does n't have to be the case with this property . " At this point , as Congress settles down for budget negotiations before the end of the year , Bingaman says sportsmen should contact their own representatives in Congress to support the purchase . " There 's nothing that focuses the mind of a congressman or a senator more than being contacted by a constituent on something they 've never heard about , " Bingaman says . " I think it 's fair to say that most congressmen and most senators have never heard about the Valles Caldera . " PRO-PUBLIC VIEWS Two mounted brown trout glisten on the wall of the ranch house . Each hook-jawed fish beats 25 inches and both are outrageously stout . And both came from the headwaters of the Rio San Antonio , here on the Baca Ranch . Garrett VeneKlasen , a young New Mexico fishing guide , caught these fish . Through his company InterAngler , he takes clients fishing around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's rivers to put fishing on the Baca Ranch in perspective . " It would be a fantastic acquisition for the public , especially if they do put good regulations on the water and manage it correctly , " VeneKlasen says . " If it gets bought and it 's worms and dynamite and whatever , it will just be another mediocre place . But if you can create a fishery that 's appealing to the national market , then you 're going to have the big bucks coming in . " Bill Huey , former director of the New Mexico Department of Game and Fish , had worked with James Dunigan on efforts to sell the ranch to the federal government before Dunigan died . Now retired , Huey is pushing hard to get the ranch into public hands . " I do n't think you can find any place in the United States that 's remotely comparable , " Huey says of the Baca Ranch . Last year , 63 hunters paid between $9,000 and $10,000 apiece to hunt the ranch . They killed 58 bull elk with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scale . The average on the first of the three hunts was a little over 350 points , and two hunters last year took record-book heads . Would opening this extraordinary ranch to the public ultimately degrade it more than keeping it in private hands ? Huey says no , though it 's clear that the Baca would need to be managed closely , with an emphasis on wildlife . But another prevalent point of view in New Mexico and the West is that the federal government has too much land and too much control already . " My preference would be to see the Baca remain in private hands , " says Frank Simms , a former big-game outfitter who comes from a family prominent in New Mexico ranching and politics . Yet Simms , now manager of the 33,000-acre Lodge at Chama Ranch in northern New Mexico , says he sees common ground with those who want the federal government to buy the Baca . " It represents one of the most pristine , high-quality acre-for-acre ranches in North America , " Simms says . " It would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degraded by development .
