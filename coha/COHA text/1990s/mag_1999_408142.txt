WHAT 'S THE LATEST I CAN START TRAINING FOR AN EVENT ? A lot of people try to cram training into the week before a race , as if they 're cramming for a final exam . Unfortunately , it does n't work that way . Two to three weeks is the absolute minimum in which you can achieve any sort of marked improvement The training we do on our bikes today wo n't translate into true physiological benefits for about 10-14 days . At least six weeks is ideal . HOW DO I DETERMINE THE NUMBER AND LENGTH OF INTERVALS ? Intervals are subjective . There 's no magic number . ( Although I do no more than seven in a set-but that 's only because it 's hard for me to keep my focus longer than that . ) The best guideline is that the longer the interval the fewer efforts you do . If it 's a long threshold interval of 15-20 minutes , I might do one or two repeats . If it 's a 3minute interval , I do five to seven repeats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body . STOP DOING INTERVALS If your speed drops more than 3-5% on any interval Photograph YOU TRAIN TODAY YOU BENEFIT IN 10-14 DAYS // Or you 're unable to keep your heart rate in your target zone YOU 'RE COOKED I know a lot of mountain bikers build endurance by riding the road , but I ca n't invest in another bike . Can I get the same benefits by riding my mountain bike on pavement ? It 's not the machine that matters , it 's the workout The main benefit of road riding is that you can regulate your effort instead of just responding to the terrain as you do when mountain biking-if the trail goes straight up , you often ca n't do anything but go as hard as you can . Road riding lets you determine your effort , saving the wear and tear on your body for race day or your hard weekend rides . When I travel to Europe for the World Cup in the spring , I ride only my mountain bike for four or five weeks . So , it can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road-for example , invest in slick tires to swap with your knobbies . In the final miles of a race , I 've starting ditching water and energy drinks and going for a mixture of water and Coke . I love the burst of energy from the caffeine-but am I doing something bad to my body , like sending it into overdrive or raising my tolerance to caffeine so I 'll need more and more ? The boost you 're feeling is from the sugar . The caffeine is such a small amount that it 's insignificant . As far as adverse health risks , I do n't think there are any . If Coke works for you-even if only as a placebo-that 's fine . Whatever works . Some of the best pros in the world employ the same tactic . Long season , many miles . I 'm starting to feel stale . What can I dobesides hanging up the bike for awhile-to get juiced again ? First , try varying your program . I 've been going at a high intensity and doing a lot of racing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started doing a lot of long , steady rides to recharge my battery . I still spend time on the bike but at a lower intensity , which helps me extend my peak fitness . Wherever you are in your season , if you find yourself getting stale cut the in SET SHORTTERM GOALS Put some sort of schedule on paper . You get a feeling ol accomplishment Even if it 's as simple as : Monday : rest day Tuesday : intervals Wednesday : easy ride I WANT TO DEVELOP LATE-RIDE STRENGTH No matter what I do , I always blow up at the end of our fast group rides , when the pace gets cranked higher and higher for the last 5 miles . Is there any training that will help me ? I 'd guess that rather than a lack of late-ride strength , your troubles are probably an inability to eliminate lactic acid . Cyclists who feel totally spent either get depleted of glycogen or produce so much lactic acid they just have to slow down . I 'm assuming that " no matter what I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so my recommendation is to focus on what I call " lactic-acid-tolerance intervals : ' If you do them for three weeks your body will learn to tolerate lactic acid . You 'll train your body to metabolize the acid and eliminate it quickly . This is hard training , and it 's rare that people are committed enough to do it . But if you can , you 'll definitely finish those rides . CONQUER LACTIC ACID DO SHORT INTERVALS AT MAXIMUM EFFORT-AS HARD AS YOU CAN GO FOR A SET AMOUNT OF TIME . A GOOD SAMPLE WORKOUT : 5 REPS OF 2 MINUTES HARD RIDING AND 2 MINUTES OF RECOVERY OR TRY 1-MINUTE INTERVALS- BUT GO HARDER . THE SHORTER THE INTERVAL , THE HARDER THE INTENSITY . DO THIS ONCE A WEEK FOR 3 WEEKS . tensity and just do rides for fun . If you 're a mountain biker , hook up with some road riders  --  and if you 're a roadie , hit the trails . Another reason people go stale is a lack of short-term goals . They get in a rut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 've helped a lot of people get out of ruts by having them put some sort of schedule on paper . You can say , " Okay , I did what I was supposed to do " Sticking to short-term goals keeps me mentally fresh . Is it better to train alone or with a partner ? I 've heard both are true . The ability to train solo is an important quality to acquire . But almost without exception you 'll push yourself harder with a partner . But groups can work to your detriment if you have an easy ride planned and get pushed too hard by friends . The best mix is usually to do the easy , recovery rides by yourself and for moti-fa vation on the hard , interval days ride with a friend who has similar conditioning . You 'll probably get more out of your workouts this way . I 've been finishing in the top 10 in the beginner class at mountain bike races . I want to make the jump up to sport class . Can you suggest some kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faster races ? The most common weakness of novice racers is the lack of any real structure in their training . The easiest way to go faster is to introduce structure into your week . To be a good sport-class rider , dedicate one day a . week to a threshold workout : 20-30 minutes of riding at about 85% of your maximum heart rate . This helps you develop the sustained strength you 'll need , and also helps build endurance . To Become A Sport-Class Racer RIDE 20 TO 30 MINUTES AT 85% OF MAX 1 DAY PER WEEK Start with 20 minutes and each week increase it by about 5 minutes until you 're up to about an hour at that pace . ( That 's about two months . ) This will definitely give you the conditioning you need for sport-class racing . I 'm confused by rest days . I follow a training program and I have two rest days a week , but am I supposed to do nothing ? Or pedal my bike slowly ? How about a game of soccer at noontime ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bike-I do that all the time . Rest days should be devoted to rest . Days off the bike are just as important as the hard days on it . I would n't recommend the game of soccer if you 're totally committed to a cycling goal . To do your best at any level you need to devote the necessary effort-and that includes recovery time . Eddy Merckx or Chow Yun-Fat ? Since I do n't know Chow Yun-Fat , I 'd have to say I never chow on young fat . That 's your diet tip for the day . Sidebar Climbing makes you stronger faster than any other type of riding . Include at least one hilly course per week in your training . If you go hard from the start of every ride , that 's not training . That 's cruelty to muscles , ligaments and tendons . Start a training ride in the small chainring , spinning gently at 90 rpm or less . You do n't get fit in the first 10 minutes . Sidebar How far can you ride ? Your limit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training ride . If you want to take a day off , do it two days before the race . On the day before , do a short ride with a couple of surges to fast speed . This opens your lungs and reminds your body what going hard feels like . Sidebar To control your pace during the early miles of a long ride , do a negative splitride the second half faster than the first Ca n't ride ? Spin on a trainer for 15 minutes before bed . It works for pro downhiller Leigh Donovan . Some pros swear by protein recovery drinks and gels to prevent muscle soreness and breakdown . // <p>
