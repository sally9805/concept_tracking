I am the shadow sinister called Fate .... I am the Master Umpire and I call the plays the way I see them . I have raised my arm , and nine grand boys are out .  --  SPOKANE INDIANS ' MEMORIAL PROGRAM July 8 , 1946 // Shortly before 11 o'clock on the drizzly morning of Monday , June 24 , 1946 , 16 members of the Spokane Indian baseball team of the Class B Western International League boarded a chartered bus for Bremerton , 295 miles across Washington State . The players were in a jubilant humor , for though they were in only fifth place after 60 games , the day before they had rallied in the ninth inning to defeat the front-running Salem ( Ore . ) Senators in the second game of a doubleheader . The Indians were convinced their season was about to turn around . // Spokane was a solid ball club in a fast minor league made all the faster by the return of so many World War II veterans . After 40 games the Indians had five regulars hitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baseman Vic Picetti , outfielder Levi McCormack , outfielder Bob Paterson and infielder-outfielder Fred Martinez . Then a brief slump dropped the team in the standings , but the players ' confidence was unshaken . The Indians , in fact , had several bona fide big league prospects . Lohrke , a smooth fielder hitting .345 on June 24 , was considered a solid bet , and so were the speedy Paterson ( .317 , 15 stolen bases ) and Martinez ( the team 's leading hitter after 60 games , at .353 ) . Lohrke and Paterson were 22 ; Martinez , 24 . All three were war veterans . Another vet , 24-year-old Milt Cadinha , a righthanded pitcher who , though only 5 ' 10 " and 160 pounds , was at least a long-shot prospect because of his hopping fastball , sharp curve and ( at that level of play ) unhittable screwball . Cadinha had an 8-1 record as the team bus left for Bremerton. // But the surefire major leaguer among the Indians , they all agreed , was Picetti , the latest in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brothers , Frankie Crosetti and the 1941 National League MVP , Dolf Camilli . Picetti had attracted hordes of major league scouts as a star at San Francisco 's Mission High School and at a national high school all-star game at the Polo Grounds , in New York City . But he signed instead with the Oakland Oaks of the Pacific Coast League , mainly because his boyhood idol , Camilli , was their manager . Picetti was the Oaks ' regular first baseman in 1945 , and though only 18 , he hit .282 . " Vic Picetti , " said Camilli , " is the greatest prospect I ever saw come straight out of high school . " // But in 1946 Oakland got a new manager , Casey Stengel , and he believed that with the war over and so many older players returning , Picetti should have a year of seasoning in a lower minor league . The teenage phenom was unhappy about being optioned to Spokane , not so much because he was offended by the demotion but because he had never been obliged to stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the ultimate first baseman , " says his former teammate Cadinha . " But he was terribly homesick , and when he went into a slump , he just got down on himself . He was such a quiet kid , nice as can be . Everybody thought he was wonderful . But he was lonely up in Spokane. " // Before the bus left town on June 24 , Picetti , his average down to .285 , asked player-manager Mel Cole if he could take a week off after the Bremerton series to return home to San Francisco and spend time with his widowed mother . " Mel , " he said , " I 'll be a new man when I get back here . " Cole agreed , scarcely knowing what else to say . // Cole , only 25 himself , was new to the role of father-confessor . When the Indians had broken from spring training in Marysville , Calif. , he was merely another catcher struggling to get his game back after Navy service in the war . The Indians were then managed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pirates and the Brooklyn Dodgers but by then a 45-year-old has-been with a big league drinking problem . " Glenn was a terrific guy , " recalls Darwin ( Gus ) Hallbourg , who then pitched for the Indians . " But he was drunk from the time we left Marysville to when we got back to Spokane . " When Wright went on a binge a few days before the opener and could n't be found , the Indians ' owner , Sam W. Collins , asked Cole to take over . Cadinha beat Vancouver that night on a two-hitter . Cole kept the job . // The homesick Picetti was probably the only unhappy player on this otherwise happy-go-lucky team . Most of the others , as war veterans , were just glad to be alive and playing baseball again . As a member of the Army Signal Corps , Cadinha had been part of both the D Day landing at Normandy and the Battle of the Bulge . Then he was shipped to Okinawa , too late for the battle there but in time for a devastating typhoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Englander , was serving on a Navy light cruiser preparing for the invasion of Japan . He and the others were , they knew , lucky . // But the luckiest of them all was Lohrke , a handsome youngster discovered by Pacific Coast League scouts on the semipro diamonds of Los Angeles . In 1942 , his first year of pro ball , he was named the team MVP at Twin Falls , Idaho , in the Class C Pioneer League . Then he was drafted into the Army . Lohrke fought with the 35th Infantry Division at Normandy and at the Bastogne , emerging unscathed from two of the European war 's deadliest battles . " I was n't exactly Sergeant York , " he says . " My father did n't want heroes in our family . " // Awaiting discharge at Camp Kilmer , N.J. , in November 1945 , Lohrke secured a ride aboard an Army transport plane headed back to Los Angeles . He was finally going home . But at the last minute he was bumped from the flight by , he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angry and disappointed : " For one thing , I 'd never been on a plane before . " Lucky he missed this one . En route to San Pedro , Calif. , the transport crashed , killing everyone on board . // Like most professional sports teams reorganizing after the war , the Spokane Indians were an odd mix . Picetti was the baby of the team . McCormack , a Native American ( his father was a Nez Perc chief ) , was 31 years old , and , as a former Washington State footballer and veteran Western International League ballplayer , he was the team 's most popular personality , known affectionately as the Chief . But there were other older players , for this was a time when the minor leagues were populated not only by youngsters on the way up to the big time but also by oldsters on their way down . Both second baseman Ben Geraghty , 33 , and catcher Chris Hartje , 31 , had played , albeit briefly , in the major leagues before the war . The others were all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comparable minor league team would be composed almost entirely of teenagers like Picetti. // But for all the disparity in age and experience , and despite the fact that most of the Indians were playing together for the first time , they were unusually close . And because so many players traveled with their wives and children , a family atmosphere prevailed . " I was the happiest person in the world with those wonderful guys , " Cadinha says today . // Cadinha had been married only two months before the season started , and he and his wife , Yuvonna , had taken a small apartment in Spokane . They were rarely apart , but Cadinha had planned to take the bus trip to Bremerton with the team on June 24 . Then , fortuitously , his teammate and good friend Joe Faria , another pitcher , told him he was going to drive to Bremerton with his wife , Pat , in their prewar Buick convertible . Would Milt and Yuvonna care to come along with them ? // The team bus , chartered from the Washington Motor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capacity of only 25 . With 16 players and their gear , there would be little room to spare , so Cadinha and Faria and their wives would be traveling in relative comfort . " This was the first time that season I had n't taken the bus , " Cadinha recalls . // Several hours after the team left , owner Collins received word that Lohrke , on option to Spokane from the San Diego Padres , had been called up to join that Pacific Coast League team . He was to make the considerable jump from Class B to Triple A after only 60 games . Collins , an experienced minor league executive in his first season of running the Spokane franchise , was , on the one hand , disappointed to lose such a key player but , on the other , pleased for Lohrke . The question was how to reach him with the good news . Collins enlisted the aid of the Washington State Patrol in tracking down the bus . And when the team stopped for hamburgers in Ellensburg , 175 miles west of Spokane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately . Afterward , elated with the news , he announced to all his latest bit of good fortune . As his teammates reboarded the bus , which had returned from a repair shop , Lohrke climbed on to shake hands with everyone and say goodbye . // " I wanted to wish them all well , particularly my roommates , Freddie Martinez and Bob James , " Lohrke recalls . " Being called up was a big deal for me . In the coast league I 'd be riding trains . " But first he would have to bum a ride back to Spokane , since " everything I owned was back there , " he says . // Lohrke 's promotion  --  well deserved , the players all thought  --  was the talk of the bus as the Indians resumed their cross-state journey . With Lohrke gone , Hallbourg , his seatmate , now had room to stretch out , which , drowsily , he did as dusk descended on the countryside . // The next hundred miles would be the slowest and most treacherous part of the trip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plains . The little bus with its cargo of ballplayers would rise on a two-lane road carved from the sides of mountains through scenery both spectacular and forbidding : dense blue-black forests , and jagged peaks that thrust upward like knives . Above them were swarming sepia clouds , and below , the raging south fork of the Snoqualmie River . And it was raining steadily . // At the Snoqualmie Pass , 57 miles west of Ellensburg and 50 miles east of Seattle , Hallbourg looked out his window and saw only darkness below . He turned to pitcher Bob Kinnaman , also a lover of the outdoors . " Would n't this be a hell of a place to go off the road ? " Hallbourg said , half in jest . Kinnaman nervously nodded . // At that same moment driver Glenn Berg was startled to see headlights flashing toward him as he negotiated a narrow turn . He swerved to avoid a possible collision , and the bus went into a sidelong skid , scraping the guardrail in a shower of sparks for several hundred feet before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his car some distance behind the bus , watched in horror as it plunged into the Snoqualmie abyss . " I just saw the tail end disappear over the side , " he told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer . " And then , when I pulled over , I saw it rolling over and over straight down . " There were no trees in this part of the canyon to halt the lethal descent . The bus seemed to bounce like a rubber ball off massive boulders as it plummeted an estimated 350 feet . And then it exploded in flames  --  a " pyre , " read a Post-Intelligencer headline , " a raging holocaust . " // Hallbourg somehow survived as the flaming wreckage rode to its final , explosive stop . He is convinced now that the seat next to him , vacated by Lohrke , saved his life : " I was in the middle of the bus . The gas tanks exploded in the front . The roof was caved in , but because I had that extra space , I was able to crouch down and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of me. " // When the hellish ride was over , Hallbourg , his pitching arm and hand burned , his hair singed , his body a mass of scrapes and bruises , heard no sound but the crackling of flames at the front of the bus . " There was such a stillness , " he recalls . " I did n't even hear yells or screams when we went over the side . " // As the flames bore down on him , he wriggled through a broken window . Dazed and in pain , he staggered away from the wreckage in search of his teammates . The first he saw was the Chief , McCormack , his nose smashed , his face a mask of blood . But alive . The two men shook hands , one survivor greeting another . Then they heard terrible cries from above and saw the crushed body of young Picetti lying on a boulder . " It looked like he 'd been thrown out ahead and then the bus rolled over him , " Hallbourg says . " I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He placed his jacket over the suffering young man . // State patrolmen and state forest rangers reached the scene quickly and , after lowering themselves by ropes , used pulleys to raise the injured and the dead from the fiery canyon . " Rescue squads roped down the muddy bank to the bottom of the ravine with the aid of emergency red flares and spotlights that cast a garish light over the scene of horror , " the Post-Intelligencer reported . John Bullard , a Seattle photographer taking pictures of the accident for the state patrol , told the newspaper , " I have covered many tragic accidents ... but I never have seen anything like I saw tonight . It was like a nightmare  --  the smashed bus burning in the canyon and the rain slanting down and the mountains looming all around . " // The few players capable of movement tried to help . Pete Barisoff , a young pitcher , pulled catcher Irv Konopka through a window of the bus to safety . Barisoff had a chipped heel bone , Konopka a fractured shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was , we both would have cooked in the fire , " Barisoff said later . // Six of the Spokane Indians  --  Cole , Paterson , James , Martinez , Kinnaman and 23-year-old shortstop George Risk  --  had been killed instantly . Picetti was pronounced dead on arrival that night at King County Hospital in Seattle . George Lyden , a 22-year-old relief pitcher , died the next day , Hartje a day later . Nine dead . It was the worst accident in the history of professional baseball . Eight of the nine victims had lived through the worst war in history , only to die on a bus . The six survivors ( not counting Berg , the driver , who also lived ) were all seriously injured . Only a few would ever play again ... and those not for very long . // Cadinha and Faria did n't learn of the tragedy until early the next morning . They hurried to the hospital and were stunned by what they saw . " We were shocked to death , " says Cadinha . " There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All those super , super guys ... gone . " // When the hitchhiking Lohrke finally got back to Spokane , he called Collins to find out when he was supposed to report to San Diego . " There 's been a terrible accident , " Collins told him . " They think it 's our boys . " After learning the details , Lohrke wired his parents in Los Angeles . " Safe and sound , " he wrote . " Back in Spokane . " John and Marguerite Lohrke were mystified ; they had n't yet heard of the Snoqualmie horror . They soon did , however , for the accident was a nationwide shocker , both in and out of baseball . // Stengel and his Oakland Oaks , who had lost farmhands Picetti , Paterson and Kinnaman , played a memorial benefit game at Spokane 's Ferris Field against the Seattle Rainiers on July 8 . The game raised $24,257 , thanks in part to Bing Crosby  --  a native of Washington and an alumnus of Gonzaga University in Spokane  --  who bought $2,500 worth of tickets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Indians did not resume play until the Fourth of July , 10 days after the crash . Of the original team , only Cadinha , Faria and , eventually , Hallbourg were able to play again that season . Wright was asked to manage again for what remained of the season , relying largely on players called in from other teams . Playing 10 to 12 fewer games than the other Western International League teams , the Indians finished seventh , 29 games behind the pennant-winning Wenatchee Chiefs . // Hallbourg , 5-1 before the accident , missed nearly six weeks recovering from his injuries . After he returned to the Indians , he finished the season with a record of 7-6 . He held on in baseball for another two years , then quit at the age of 28 to work for the telephone company in Stockton , Calif . He retired 32 years later as a supply supervisor and now lives in Manteca , where he gardens and plays golf with his wife , Roberta . // Cadinha , the ace of the Spokane staff , was 8-6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record . " It was hard to win after the accident , " he says . At the end of the season he was sold to the Pacific Coast League 's Hollywood Stars , a first step toward the big leagues . But pitching in a semipro league in the Bay Area that winter , he broke his arm throwing a screwball . He never pitched again . A retired insurance agent , he lives in Castro Valley , not 50 miles from Hallbourg . They rarely see each other . // McCormack , the Chief , tried a comeback with the Indians in 1947 but gave it up later that season . His old teammate and fellow survivor Geraghty managed the team to a second-place finish in ' 47 , a season in which Spokane fans , making a heartfelt comeback themselves , set a Class B attendance record of 287,185 . In a further irony , Camilli  --  who , had he stayed on as the Oakland manager , would probably not have sent Picetti to Spokane  --  managed the Indians to a pennant in 1948 . Stengel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Pacific Coast League pennant in ' 48 and then , as history informs us , was hired by the New York Yankees . // Lohrke hit .303 as San Diego 's regular shortstop in the 92 games left of the ' 46 Pacific Coast League season and then was drafted by the New York Giants . He was the Giants ' third baseman for much of the ' 47 season , hitting .240 in 112 games for a team that set a major league record of 221 home runs . Lohrke hit 11 himself , including the homer that tied the Yankees ' old record of 182 and the one that broke it . But , he says , " with guys like Johnny Mize , Walker Cooper and Willard Marshall around , I was pretty much lost in the shuffle . " // From the time he joined the Padres after the accident , Lohrke was called , for obvious reasons , " Lucky "  --  Lucky Lohrke , the ballplayer who got off the bus in the nick of time , the soldier bumped from the plane that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , had more right to be called Lucky ? He 's in the Baseball Encyclopedia that way : Lucky Lohrke . An amiable man , he lived with the nickname , but he never liked it , never wanted to be reminded of how close he had come to riding that bus into oblivion . But what could he do about it ? // Lohrke played in only 97 games for the Giants in 1948 and from then on was exclusively a utility player . He was warming up in the Giants ' bullpen as a possible replacement at third base when Bobby Thomson hit " the shot heard round the world , " which won the 1951 pennant . In the World Series that year against the Yankees , Lohrke struck out and popped up as a pinch hitter . He played for the Philadelphia Phillies in 1952 and ' 53 , finishing a seven-year major league career with a .242 batting average , and then he returned to the coast league , where he played until his retirement from baseball in 1954 . Now 70 and retired from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Silicon Valley , Lohrke lives in San Jose with his wife , Marie , whom he married 46 years ago . // After a bus carrying the California Angels crashed on the New Jersey Turnpike on May 21 , 1992 , causing some serious injuries but no deaths , Lohrke was sought out once more by newspapers and television stations to recall his own narrow escape ... or escapes . He willingly cooperated , agreeing with interviewers that he is indeed a lucky man . Lucky Lohrke. // But the memory pains him . " When you 're the age I was back then , " he says , " you have n't got a worry in the world . You 're playing ball because you want to play  --  and they 're giving you money to do it . And then ... well , sometimes those names spring back at me. " // He clears his throat . " I 'll tell you this : Nobody outside of baseball calls me Lucky Lohrke these days . I may have been lucky , but the name is Jack . Jack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
