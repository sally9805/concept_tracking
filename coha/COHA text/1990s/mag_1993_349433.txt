SOMETIME LAST MONDAY afternoon , Francois Nassau rested his distended belly on the floor of his father 's hovel , curled one thin arm under his head , and quietly died . So silent was the boy 's passing that his mother did not realize he was gone until she tried to rouse him . Francois was nine years old . <P> More than a year ago , Francois , his parents and 116 other Haitians had set out with a desperate sense of hope aboard a leaking sloop called Dieu Veut ( God Wants ) . For two days they rolled and pitched across the rough stretch of sea between Haiti and Cuba that sailors call the Windward Passage . They had left their homes in Petit-Trou-de-Nippes , a town of 1,000 perched on the shore of Haiti 's impoverished southern claw , provisioned with only two bags of rice and a single 50-gal. barrel of water . Even at sea they continued to take on new passengers  --  some arriving in dugout canoes , others by swimming . All were convinced that Dieu Veut was their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boat was intercepted by the U.S. Coast Guard , and the refugees passed the next two months in detention at the Guantanamo Bay naval base in Cuba . Only 25 of the refugees were allowed to apply for political asylum . The rest were shipped back to the docks at Port- au-Prince , given the equivalent of $15 and told to go home , where many were greeted by a rogue police force that reserves special violence for people who are returned against their will . <P> The refugees had left Petit-Trou in the first place four months after the coup that deposed Jean-Bertrand Aristide in 1991 , when soldiers began arriving in trucks to round up suspected supporters of the exiled President . They hunted in particular for a group of 65 young men who were organizing a peasant co-op . Desperate not to lose the best of its youth , the community elected to pour its savings , its hopes and its most promising citizens into a single boat to America . Selling everything but their beds , the town cobbled together $1,650 and persuaded its wealthiest resident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy " a 30-ft. sloop from police . <P> After the venture failed , those who made their way back to Petit-Trou found a very different village from the one they left . Before the expedition the town was tense , fearful , expectant . Today it is hollow and listless , its surviving residents thin with despair . In the past three months no mail has been delivered and no trucks have arrived with supplies . There are no stores , no cars , no doctors . There are no books in the schools , which does n't matter because most parents can no longer afford to send their children . The hospital has ceased to function , and the only government offices still working are the tax collector and the local police post , which boasts a .50-cal. machine gun and the sergeant 's collection of whips . The only work to be found is making charcoal that is shipped by boat to the slums of Port-au-Prince , but with each tree that is cut and burned , more soil washes away , and with it the village 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cereal crops here , corn and rice , " says Rene Coty , the local schoolteacher . " But no longer ; the land has washed away . Instead we grow charcoal  --  a crop with no future . "
