I ca n't help wondering if kabaddi 's chances of being accepted as an Olympic sport are being damaged by the fact that it 's so hard to believe . I do n't mean that the feats some of its players manage seem unbelievable , in the way it seems unbelievable for Michael Jordan to make a home for himself several feet off the ground . I do n't mean that , as might be said of riding a bicycle straight up a mountain , it 's hard to believe that anybody would want to do such a thing , even for a gold medal and a cereal-endorsement contract . I mean that it 's difficult to persuade people that the game of kabaddi actually exists . When it comes to making a presentation to the Olympic committee , that has to be a disadvantage . <P> I became aware of kabaddi 's believability problem in 1994 , when I mentioned in print that I had been in Japan during the Asian Games , which included a demonstration of an ancient sport from the Indian subcontinent called kabaddi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Well , there are two seven-man teams , and a player from one team  --  he 's called the raider  --  is sent into the opponents ' half of the field , " I later explained to my friend Charlie . " He tries to touch as many opposing players as possible , and they try not to be touched or to keep him from returning to his territory . " <P> " So ? " Charlie said . " So , " I said . I paused . " Well , " I continued . " So . Well , during this entire time , the raider has to keep saying **28;4423;TOOLONG ... " <P> Charlie stared at me for a long time . Finally , he said , " Right . And that 's Hindi for , ' I knew I should have gotten these shorts in an extra large . ' " Then he started to cackle . After that conversation , his standard greeting to me became , " Kabaddikabaddikabaddi , and a very Happy New Year . " <P> Actually , the word kabaddi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath "  --  the point of the chant being that the raider has to accomplish his mission in one breath . I learned that only last month from an article by an English writer named John Hargreaves in Hemispheres , the United Airlines magazine . Although the word kabaddi is used for the chant in most of the world , Hargreaves wrote , " in Nepal this is ' Do-Do , ' in Sri Lanka ' Guddo , ' in Malaysia ' Chaddo-Guddo , ' and in Indonesia ' Techib . ' " Imagine appearing before the Olympic committee to argue acceptance for a game in which players constantly say " do-do . " <P> According to Hargreaves , kabaddi was played as a demonstration sport at the 1936 Olympics , and kabaddi adherents , who now extend to England and Canada , hope " it will be seen at the Olympics again before too long . " Before too long ! The 1936 games were 60 years ago . Have Olympic officials really been mulling this over for more than a half-century ? <P> I think not . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that the Olympic spectacle includes little of the human voice beyond an occasional grunt by a weight lifter . I do n't think that anyone has speculated on the multicultural impact of allowing one team to say " chaddo-guddo " while the other says " techib . " No , I think kabaddi was simply not believed . <P> I can imagine those old poops on the Olympic committee watching the demonstration in 1936 . " How droll , " the English representative says . <P> " Yes , indeed , " the Belgian says . " Kabaddikabaddikabaddi. "
