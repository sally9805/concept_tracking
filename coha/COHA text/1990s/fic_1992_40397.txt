Got the four plus six ? Got the Sylovan , the Di50Si ? The lawn projectors ? The Thumper , just in case ? Oh , and a Dutch Elm chip for the mall . We might make it by there today . " <p> It was a bright , mournful June day . The traffic was colorful and hard . The roadsides were brilliant green , newly painted for spring . <p> " Here we are , Gail , Whispering Woods . " We pulled past the wrought-iron gates , between the two big laser maples with Dolby rustling leaves , and around the curved drive lined with big houses set on wide pseudolawns . It was all " nerf and turf " ( that 's what Carl calls verdechip and astrolawn ) until the Barbers ' house at the turnaround . <p> Their lawn was not green but yellow-green . It was the only organic lawn in the sub . We put it in for them four years ago , and for two years it almost made it ; then last summer we had to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of the line . <p> Mrs. Barber was standing at the door looking worried . Her husband pulled in the drive just as we did . She must have called us both at the same time . <p> " Jesus , " Mr. Barber said as he got out of his Chrysler Iacocca and looked at his yellowing hundred thousands dollars ( $104,668.29 to be precise ; I sometimes watched Carl do the books ) . " It 's not too late , is it , Carl ? " <p> " It 's never too late , Mr. Barber , " Carl said . The greenest part of the lawn made a crisscross pattern like an X ray showing the underground grid where the drip saturators were buried ; the rest of the grass was jaundiced yellow . A darker brown edge ran all around the yard , like paper just before it bursts into flame . <p> " Code Six , Gail , " Carl said , revising his original assessment . " Give me four point five liters of straight Biulogormicaine on a speed inject . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambulogger . " <p> The nutritank was built onto the side of the ranch-style home , disguised as a shed . I spilled in a four-can of Bi , added some Phishphlakes for good measure , and set the underpumps whinning on Super . Out front , Carl trotted up and down the lawn with a Diprothemytaline sprayer , while the Barbers looked on , worried , from the doorway . A few neighbors had gathered at the curb , a mixture of concern and poorly disguised pleasure on their faces . I could tell that the Barbers and their organic lawn were not popular . <p> The quick Dipro fix gives a green flush to the skinny little leaves of the grass . I could hear them sigh with relief through the soles of my feet . But unless the satura-solution coming up from the IV grid found living roots , the whole thing would be a waste . <p> Carl looked grave as he put the sprayer back into the truck . " If it 's not looking better by Wednesday , call me , " he said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 'll stop by on Friday to adjust the IV solution , and I 'll check it then . " <p> " How much is this  --  going to cost ? " Mr. Barber whispered , so his wife and the neighbors could n't hear . Carl gave him a mournful , disapproving look , and Mr. Barber turned away , ashamed . <p> " Hell , I understand where he 's coming from , though , " Carl told me when we were back on the road . " It used to be that when you bought a lawn you could get insurance , especially with a new house , but these days nobody is insured . You can insure a tree , a potted one , anyway , or a cybershrub , and of course any kind of holo . But a living lawn ? Jesus , Gail , no wonder the guy 's worried . " <p> Carl 's empathy is his best quality . <p> We stopped for lunch at Lord Byron 's on the Princeton bypass ; it 's the only place that 'll allow a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a veterans ' hospital for twenty years before he saved enough to open his own place . Because of this medical background , he thinks he 's a doctor . <p> " The usual , " said Carl . Two beers and a sloppy joe on a hard roll . <p> Lord Byron lifted my cap and his huge warm black hand covered the top of my head . " Just as I thought , " he said . " Cold as ice . Sure you ca n't find something on the menu you can eat , Gay ? " <p> He never could say my name right either . <p> After lunch we changed the motherboard on a flowerbed at a funeral home on Route 303 . The display was one of those cheap , sixteen-bit jobs that you ca n't walk through , that only look right from a hundred yards or so . Carl had sold it to them last fall . It was supposedly upgradable , but in fact the company that made it had gone out of business over the winter , and now the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variety or even the colors of the flowers without a whole new CPU . <p> Carl explained this hesitantly , expecting an argument , but the funeral home manager signed for the new chip , a Hallmark clone , in a minute . " It 's one of these franchise operations , Gail , " Carl said on the way back to the shop . " They do n't care what they spend . Hell , why should they ? It 's all tax-deductible under the Environmental Upgrade Act . I never liked flowers much anyway . Even organic ones . " <p> Tuesday was a better day because we got to dig . We put in ten meters of Patagonian Civet Hedge at Johnson , Johnson &; Johnson . Pat is not really Patagonian ; the name is supposed to suggest some kind of hardy stock . It 's actually cyberhedge , a fert-saturated plastate lattice with dri-gro bud lodgments at twenty-millimeter intervals on a 3-D grid . But the tiny leaves that grow out of it are as real as I am . They bask in the sun and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were any , would be fooled . <p> Carl was in a great mood . Ten meters of Pat at three hundred and twenty-five dollars a meter is a nice piece of change . And since the roots themselves are not alive , you can put them directly into untreated ground . There 's something about the sliding of a shovel into the dirt that stirs the blood of a nurseryman . <p> " This is the life , right , Gail ? " Carl said . <p> I nodded and grinned back at him . Even though something about the dirt did n't smell right . It did n't smell wrong . It just did n't smell at all . <p> After lunch at Lord Byron 's , Carl sold two electric trees at the Garden State Mall . The manager wanted the trees for a display at the main entrance , and Carl had to talk him out of organics . Carl does n't like the electrics any better than I do , but sometimes they are the only alternative . <p> " I sort of wanted real trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't , " Carl said . " Look , organic trees are too frail . Even if you could afford them  --  and you ca n't  --  they get weird diseases , they fall over . You 've got to feed them day and night . Let me show you these new Dutch Elms from Microsoft . " He threw the switch on the holoprojector while started piecing together the senso-fence . " See how great they look ? " Carl said . " Go ahead , walk all the way around them . We call them The Immortals . Bugs do n't eat on them , they never get sick , and all you have to feed them is one-ten . We can set this projector up on the roof , so you do n't have to worry about cars running over it . " <p> " I sort of wanted something that cast a shadow , " the manager said . " You do n't want shadows here at the mall anyway , " said Carl , who had an answer for everything when he was selling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoppers walking through the trees "  --  he passed his hand through the trunk  --  " and spoiling the image , either . That 's what this fence is for , which my lovely assistant is setting up . Ready , Gail ? " <p> I set two sections of white picket fence next to the tree and snapped them together . <p> " That 's not a holo , " said the manager . <p> " No , sir . Solid plastic , " Carl said . " And it does a lot more than just keep people from walking or driving through the trees . The pickets themselves are sophisticated envirosensors . Made in Singapore . Watch . " <p> I turned on the fence , and since there was no wind , Carl blew on a picket . The leaves on the trees waved and wiggled . He covered a picket with his hand and a shadow fell over the treetops . " They respond to actual wind and sun conditions , for the utmost in total realism . Now , let 's suppose it looks like rain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carl a paper cup and he sprinkled water on the pickets with his fingertips , like a priest giving a blessing . The leaves of the trees shimmered and looked wet . " We call them the Immortals , " Carl said again , proudly . <p> " What about birds ? " <p> " Birds ? " <p> " I read somewhere that birds get confused and try to land in the branches or something , " the manager said . " I forget exactly . " <p> Carl 's laugh was suddenly sad . " How long since you 've seen a bird ? " <p> Wednesday was the day we had set aside to service Carl 's masterpiece , the Oak Grove at Princeton University . These were not ailanth-oaks or composite red " woods " ; these were full-sized white oaks of solid wood that grew not out of pots but straight out of the " ground "  --  a.09-acre ecotrap colloid reservoir saturated with a high-electrolyte forced-drip solution of Arborpryzinamine Plus , the most effective ( and expensive ) IV arbo-stabilizer ever developed . The ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fully 44 feet tall . They were grand . The Grove was seven oaks in all , only two less than the state forest in Windham . Princeton was the only private institution in New Jersey that could afford so many organic trees . <p> But something was wrong . There was n't a leaf on any of them . <p> " Code Seven , Gail , " said Carl with an undertone of panic in his voice . I limped up the hill as fast as I could and checked the vats under the Humanities building , but they were almost full and the solution was correct , so I left them . Trees are n't like grass ; there was no point in cranking up the IV pump pressure . <p> Carl was honking the horn , so I got back in the truck and we left to look for the Dean of Grounds . He was n't in his office . We found him at Knowledge Hall , watching an outfit from Bucks County do a scan-in on the north wall ivy . The ivy was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moaning as the software scanned and replicated each dying tendril , replacing it with a vivid green image . Then the old stuff was pulled down with a long wall rake and bagged . I was getting a headache . <p> " I just came from the grove , " Carl demanded . " How long have the oaks been bare like that ? Why did n't you call me ? " <p> " I figured they were automatic , " said the grounds dean . " Besides , nobody 's blaming you . " <p> The image-ivy came complete with butterflies , hovering tirelessly . <p> " It 's not a question of blame , " said Carl . Exasperated with the grounds dean , he put the pickup into gear . " Jump in , Gail , " he said . " Let 's head back to the grove . I think we 've got a Code Eight here . It 's time for the Thumper . " <p> The Thumper is a gasoline-powered induction coil the size of the " alligator " we used to warm the greenhouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it up , I pulled the two cables attached to it out of the truck bed and started dragging them toward the trees ; they grew heavier as they grew longer . <p> " We have n't got all day ! " Carl yelled . I clipped the red cable to a low branch on the farthest tree , and clipped the black one to a steel rod driven into the ground-colloid . Then I got back in the truck . <p> The grounds dean pulled up on his three-wheeler just as Carl hit the switch . A few students hurrying to class stopped and looked around , bewildered , as the current ripped through the pavement under them . Carl hit it twice more . I could see the topmost twigs of the trees flutter , but there was no feeling there , and hardly any far below where the taproots were curled in on themselves in dark and silent misery . <p> " That ought a wake ' em up ! " the grounds dean called out cheerily . <p> Carl ignored him . He was in the grove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he motioned for me to come over . " Volunteer , " he whispered , brushing four tiny blades of fescue with his fingertips . " I have n't seen that in years . " I felt it with my fingertips , an incredibly delicate green filigree , eagerly and shamelessly alive . It was feeding on the nutrients that should have gone to the tree roots , which had somehow lost their will to live . <p> " I 'm sorry I yelled at you , Gail , " Carl said , brushing his knees off as we stood up ; awkwardly , he leaned over and brushed mine off , too . " I do n't know what 's getting into me . " And it was true : it was the first time he had yelled at me since I had sought refuge in his nursery sixty-six months before . <p> Carl told the grounds dean that we would check on the Oak Grove tomorrow , and we left . But we both knew the electroshock was too little , too late . On the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his beloved oaks at all . Instead , he talked about the volunteer . " Remember when grass just grew , Gail ? " he said . " It was everywhere . You did n't have to feed it , or force it , or plant it , or anything . Kids made money cutting it . Hell , you could n't stop it ! It grew on the roadsides , grew in the medians , grew up through the cracks in the sidewalk . Trees , too . Trees grew wild . Leave a field alone and it turned into a forest in a few years . Life was in the air , like wild yeast ; the whole damn world was like sourdough bread . Remember , Gail ? Those were the good old days . " <p> I nodded and looked away , but not before tears of self-pity sprang unbidden to my eyes . How could I forget the good old days ? <p> By noon on Wednesday the Barbers had n't called , so we swung by their place on the way to lunch . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the center of the lawn was a brighter green , almost feverish-looking in spots . " At least it 's still alive , " Carl said , but a little uncertainly . I shrugged . I did n't feel good . <p> " That girl does n't look right to me , " said Lord Byron at lunch . I had to find a chair because I could n't balance on a counter stool . <p> " She 'll be all right , " said Carl . Next to empathy , optimism is his best quality . " And I ' 11 have the usual . " <p> Carl spent the afternoon doing the books while I dozed on a cot at the office end of the greenhouse . " What I lose in plants I make up in cybers , " he said . " I 'm the only nurseryman in the state who still services organics  --  but you know that . Funny how it all balances out , Gail . First I make money poisoning or cutting the grass ; then I make more trying to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortune in greenlawn . Paint it every spring . Same with trees . First it was sales . Then it was maintenance , life supports . Now it 's electrics . Hell , I do n't know what I 'm complaining about , Gail . I 'm making more money than ever , yet somehow I feel like I 'm going out of business .... " <p> He talked on and on all afternoon , while I tossed and turned , trying to sleep . <p> Thursday morning we approached the university with a mounting sense of dread . I had known it all along ; Carl knew it as soon as he pulled up beside the trees and shut off the engine . I did n't even have to get out of the truck to feel the silence through the soles of my feet . There was no life in the Oak Grove . Carl 's pride and joy was dead forever . <p> The volunteer fescue was gone , too . We got out to look , but it had dried up overnight and only brown blades were left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Maybe the Thumper had killed it ; or maybe it had just run out of life , like everything else seemed to be doing these days . <p> " Nobody 's blaming you , " said the grounds dean . He had come up behind us unnoticed and put his hand on Carl 's shoulder . " To tell the truth , Carl , we 've been having funding problems . I 'm not sure how long we could have afforded to keep the ground feed going anyway . What would you think of going to videoleaf ? Or we could even try silicyberbud branch implants , at least for a season or two . But do n't worry , we 're not going to take out these stately oaks until we absolutely have to . They 're like old friends to the students , Carl . Do you know what they call the grove ? " The Dean looked at me and winked ; I guess because he thought I was young . " The students call it the Kissing Grove ! " <p> " It 's not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never seen him so depressed . I was n't feeling so hot myself . <p> " You should send this girl home , Carl , " Lord Byron said when we stopped for lunch . " How long has she worked for you ? Gay , honey , have you ever taken a sick day ? " <p> " She lives in the greenhouse , " Carl said . " She does n't exactly work for me . And leave her cap alone ; nobody wants to look at a bald head . " <p> We spent the afternoon pulling IV fittings . The Delaware Golf Club is one of the fanciest clubs in the Garden State , and the fairways as well as the greens had been organic not so many years ago . This year we had finally lost the battle on the greens . Thursday was the deadline for us to get our hardware out so they could lay the permaturf . <p> Carl drove the pickup straight up the fairways , ignoring the angry shouts and curses of the golfers . The greens looked like the moon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threw them into the back of the pickup , but left the pipes under the ground ; they were n't worth the trouble it would take to get them out , at least for one person working alone . I was too dizzy to do much more than watch . <p> " Every spring it gets worse , " Carl muttered as he bounced across the last fairway , through the ditch , and onto the county road . " Are you okay ? Do you want me to pull over ? " <p> I tried to throw up but nothing would come . <p> Friday I could barely get up . My once-dark skin looked pale reflected in the windows of the greenhouse . Carl was tapping on the glass with the truck key . It was already ten o'clock . <p> " Code Nine , Gail ! " he said . " I 'm getting the truck . " <p> It was the Barbers . " I could n't understand what she was saying , " Carl said as he pulled out into the traffic . He gave me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dash . " But it must be bad . Hell , she was screaming . " <p> It was a bright , hard spring day ; the sky was cruel blue . Route One was jammed and Carl turned on the siren as well as the light . He drove on the shoulder , with one wheel on the asphalt and the other on the green-painted rocks . <p> By the time we got to Whispering Woods I could see it was already too late . <p> The neighbors were standing around the edges of the Barbers ' front yard , watching the grass turn yellow , then yellow-green , then yellow again , flickering like an alcohol fire in sickening waves . There was a faint crackling noise and a thin dying smell . <p> " Sounds like cereal ! " said one of the kids . <p> Carl knelt down and pulled up a clump of grass and smelled the roots ; he sniffed the air and looked over at me as if for the first time . " Code Ten , " he said in a curiously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to come ? <p> " Look out ! " one of the neighbors shouted . " Get back ! " <p> The brown at the edges of the yard was starting to darken and spread inward . The crackling grew louder as it closed on the still-green center ; it pulled back once , then again , each wave leaving the yellow-green grass a little paler . Then it all darkened at once like an eye closing , and there was silence . I felt my knees give out , so I leaned back against the truck . <p> " It 's not too late , is it , Carl ? " asked Mr. Barber , coming to the end of the walk . His wife followed him , sniffling with fear , keeping her feet on the center of the walk , away from the dead ground . The thin dying smell had given way to a foul , wet , loathsome , ugly stench as if some great grave had yawned open . <p> " What 's that smell ? " a neighbor asked . <p> " Hey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said one of the kids , tugging at Carl 's sleeve . " His hat came off . " " She 's not a boy , " said Carl . " And her name is Gaea . " I 'd never heard him get it right before . <p> " What 's that smell ? " asked another neighbor . She was sniffing not the lawn but the wind , the long one , the one that blows all the way around the world . <p> " Excuse me , " Carl said to the Barbers . He ran over and tried to pick me up , but I was too far gone . <p> " It is too late , is n't it Carl ? " said Mr. Barber , and Carl , nodding , began to cry , and so would I if I could have anymore . <p>
