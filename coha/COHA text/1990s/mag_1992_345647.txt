The air was frigid , sun splashed , and electric with suspense . Above the kaleidoscopic crowd waved the banner of the " Tombamania Club of Pisa " with its crudely drawn Leaning Tower and its message : GO FOR IT , ALBERTO ! Horns honked . Cowbells clanged . In the opening minutes of the giant slalom ski race , a Swiss racer grabbed first place . But the pilgrims from Bologna held high their sign : BIG ALBERTO , GIVE US A MEDAL . Seconds later , a Norwegian flashed to the top of the scoreboard . Balloons soared . Agitated claques from San Lazzaro , Sestriere and Vidiciatico shook their posters : WHEN YOU 'RE ALBERTO , YOU 'RE EVERYTHING . Now , a Luxembourg champion was winning by a hair . But just behind , the man known as " La Bomba " was gathering himself at the start house high on the glittering mountain . The crowd sucked in its breath , conscious that a few hundredths of a second would mark the difference between history and humiliation . <P> Never before had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seen the likes of Alberto Tomba , the flamboyant Bolognese flatlander who at 21 captured two gold medals at the Calgary Olympics . Now , four years later , he was trying to repeat the feat , having boasted to the press  --  in jest  --  that he had changed his training regimen from " sleeping with three women until 5 a.m. " to " sleeping with five women until 3 a.m . " Such bravado carried onto the ski course might make it easier to win but , oh , so much harder to lose . Clad in turquoise spandex , the racer who once called himself " the messiah of skiing " swiveled through 47 gates in 1:02.41 , or .19 sec. faster than his closest rival . Tomba became the first Alpine contestant ever to win two consecutive Olympic golds in the same event . Even the triple-gilded Jean- Claude Killy had limited himself to one Olympic year . " From the top , I could see thousands of people along the course , " Tomba recalled later . " I felt their emotion . They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through gate after gate . Many thought I could n't do it  --  but here I am . " <P> On Saturday the supercharged show-off followed a mediocre first run with a spectacular final display . But he failed to win a fourth gold , finishing only .28 sec. behind Norway 's Finn Christian Jagge in the slalom . Tomba nonetheless declared himself delighted with his silver , and the crowds were delighted with him . The Bolognese had enlivened the Games with serendipity and irresistible schmaltz . After his first triumph , Tomba sank to his knees in the arrival area , his arms outstretched , his head flung back in ecstasy . Then as the roar of the crowd grew , he rose , balanced his skis upright in the palm of his hand and pranced over to his fans . There , amid faces painted in the green , red and white stripes of the Italian flag , a banner greeted him : ALBERTO , THANK YOU FOR EXISTING .                   @ @
