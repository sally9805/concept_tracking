Wen Lena gets sick , June , her mother , does n't notice for two days . It 's a Kentucky January , bleak and rainy with an occasional paltry snow , and Lena 's father , Patrick , from whom June has been divorced one year , has just announced his plans to remarry in March . Lena hears her mother talking to friends on the phone , her voice cheery and capable , " Oh , well , you know , it was bound to happen , we 're both moving on . Now six months ago I would have been shaken to the core , " but off the phone June wanders around the house , teary-eyed at irrelevant things she brings to Lena 's attention : a greeting card commercial on television , the few dead leaves that cling to the sycamore outside the kitchen window . She gives herself a home perm and her hair turns frazzlyirregular , kinky hunks with straight , brittle ends . " What do you think ? " June says , fluffing up the back of her hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see . <p> Lena squeezes a fistful , says it feels like the pink roof insulation in the attic . This is not necessarily a bad thing , but it sends June to her bedroom for an hour . <p> At school Lena sits at her desk , listless and warm . The glands at the back of her throat swell to the size of peas , and when her teacher takes the class to the bathrooms Lena pushes past the other third-grade girls to the mirrors over the sink , where under the fluorescent light she opens her mouth to see . The corners of her mouth crack into tiny grains of dry skin from trying , but her throat lies in shadow . She contents herself by probing the lumps with the back of her tongue , just to make sure they 're still sore . She likes how her voice has gone husky . <p> At home June circles the wedding date , March twelfth , with a red pen on the calendar by the refrigerator . Since the announcement June has been talking to the pastor each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and has taken to repeating for Lena phrases he gives her : " You must learn to love yourself , " and " All things work together for the good . " <p> " Do you know what that means ? " she asks Lena somberly , as though Lena is much older . In fact , Lena seems older . It could be how her eyes shrink behind thick glasses , how in sickness her skin has taken on a yellowish tint . <p> " Do you love yourself , Lena ? " June asks , her face so close that Lena can see every hair , every pore . This close , faces look like something else entirely , the nubbly surface of the planets Lena 's seen on science shows . <p> " I guess , " says Lena . She 's never thought about feeling anything at all for herself , as though she were another person , but June seems to think it 's important , which means it might be or it might not be . The problem with June , Lena once heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production . A federal case . <p> " What 's that you 're doing with your mouth , " June says . <p> Lena has been feeling her glands , and she bites her tongue to keep it still . <p> June 's hand brushes Lena 's forehead . " You 're burning up , Lena . You 're hot as can be . Have you been feeling bad ? " <p> " I can feel my throat , " Lena says . <p> " You 're sick , " June says . " Lena , you 're sick . I did n't notice and you did n't say . Why did n't you say ? You have to say , Lena . " June 's fingers disappear into her stiff hair . She closes her eyes . " I feel like a horrible mother , " she says . <p> It turns out to be strep throat . June takes off work , the doctor gives Lena some medicine , and after four days and a weekend Lena returns to school . But three weeks later she 's sick again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the antibiotic does n't kill all the bacteria , it comes back with renewed force . <p> June is in a pinch . She processes payments at the electric company and has run out of days she can take off . The woman who used to sit for Lena during the day now has two toddlers of her own , and wo n't expose them to strep . All the mothers of Lena 's friends work , the teenaged girls are in school , and Patrick lives half a day away , over the border into Tennessee . So the pastor makes an announcement at church about a member needing a sitter , and the following Monday morning before June leaves for work , Mrs. Shefferd arrives . She is a small , bony woman , hair completely white . In the half-darkened living room , lit only by the yellow security nightlight , she keeps her coat on . It 's a faux leopard print bought from Sears some thirty years ago , and because it does n't button all the way Mrs. Shefferd wears a jacket underneath , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the weather . <p> " I 've left directions on the counter , " June says . She clips earrings onto her earlobes and buttons her coat , glancing at Mrs. Shefferd 's dim outline on the couch . <p> " Very good , " says Mrs. Shefferd , her voice throaty and sure . " You have a nice day . You do n't worry about a thing . " <p> Each morning when Lena wakes up , Mrs. Shefferd greets her with a glass of water . The directions say for Lena to drink a glass of water each hour , even though after the fourth glass , fourth hour , she can hear her stomach sloshing and has to pee every ten minutes . The directions also say when the antibiotic is to be taken and what Lena is to have for lunch each day . The notes make it clear Lena should stay in bed , but Mrs. Shefferd allows her to lie on the living room couch and watch television . Mrs. Shefferd sits in the adjacent rocker and asks Lena questions . Not the questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or church , or her parents . Instead , Mrs. Shefferd gives her choices . " Where would you rather live , " she asks . " The beach or the mountains ? " Lena says beach and Mrs. Shefferd reminds her of hurricanes . Lena says mountains and Mrs. Shefferd reminds her , cheerfully , that some mountains are volcanoes . <p> " If you could only eat foods that begin with r or c , " Mrs. Shefferd says , " which would you pick ? " <p> " R , " Lena says . <p> " No celery ? No Cream of Wheat ? " <p> " I like roast beef , " Lena says . <p> " Oh , yes , and rhubarb , " says Mrs. Shefferd . " Good thinking . " <p> When Lena feels like being up and around , she drags projects out from the back of her closet-crocheting that her grandmother tried to teach her on the last visit , a halffinished floral paint-by-number , the oils gone slick and runny inside their tiny plastic vials . Mrs. Shefferd comments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ square in tri-color pink yarn that Lena ca n't even remember how she made . <p> " I do n't know how to crochet , " Mrs. Shefferd says . She holds the square to the lamp , then rubs it against her face , eyes closed . " My mother was a different breed , " she says . Lena , kneeling at her feet , can smell cinnamon on Mrs. Shefferd 's breath . On the television people exclaim and jump around , having won a prize for guessing something , but Lena has turned down the sound . <p> Lena brings out her shoebox of teeth from her father 's office of orthodontics . They are n't real , are really just the molds he makes of patients ' teeth , to display on beforeand-after shelves in the waiting room and to take to conferences . These are the leftovers , and Lena lines them up on the living room floor for Mrs. Shefferd to admire , which she does ; so many sets of jaws , incisors twisted in their sockets , or pushed into unnatural rows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shapes of upper mouths . There are also strips of wax in little boxes , miniature rubber bands of all colors that Lena and Mrs. Shefferd string on yarn for necklaces , and a black mouthpiece Lena 's father uses to wedge open his patients ' mouths , and to pin down their tongues . It 's a durable plastic , so that if the hand of his assistant , or even his own , slips-though this has never happened-and nicks the patient 's tongue or gouges the inside of a cheek with a wire , the plastic piece prevents the patients from clamping down , further injuring themselves or the fingers of the assistant . Their mouths stay wedged open until the plastic piece is removed . <p> In the bathroom Lena and Mrs. Shefferd angle a flashlight so that Lena can see her throat in the mirror . Mrs. Shefferd points with the wrong end of a toothbrush . " Those are the glands you can feel , " she says , indicating red nodules behind her teeth . They look smaller than they feel on Lena 's tongue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all slimy pink , shot through with tiny purple veins . " And those , " Mrs. Shefferd says , pointing just behind the first pair , " are your tonsils . " Lena strains towards the light . The tonsils are red raisins , imbedded in the veiny surface . <p> Mrs. Shefferd frowns when she doles out the antibiotic before making lunch . " It 's not what they think , " she says , standing over Lena at the table . " These make you weak . Next time you 'll need more to do the same thing , mark my words . " <p> Lena feels the capsule on the back of her tongue . Just last year she had to have liquid because she gagged , but now she can swallow a pill without flinching , though she feels its shadow in her throat for a minute afterwards , no matter how much water she drinks . <p> " My mother would have done something different , " Mrs. Shefferd says . " I 'm not criticizing . Your mother does the best she can . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out your system . " <p> For lunch Mrs. Shefferd heats canned soup , or spreads peanut butter and jelly . One day she makes toast , because that 's what Lena wants , even though it 's not specified in the directions . Mrs. Shefferd makes toast in the skillet , with butter , instead of in the toaster . Fried toast . Lena , who has n't been eating well , eats twelve pieces . Mrs. Shefferd has six or seven , and then toasts the heels of the bread for dessert . When June comes home , she asks what happened to all the bread . <p> After the wedding announcement , June begins to appear beside Lena 's bed in the middle of the night . " Lena , " she says , shaking Lena awake . " Lena , we need to talk about Daddy getting married again . You 're upset , I know . You can tell me how you really feel . What do you think of Mandy ? " <p> June sits on the edge of the bed , looking fuzzy around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dresser . On her lap June holds a handful of Kleenex , which glow strangely white from the streetlight outside the window . <p> " She 's fine , " Lena says , yawning . <p> " You can tell me , " June says . <p> " She 's fine , " Lena says again . Mandy has a convertible , and at Christmas she put the top down and took Lena for a drive , even though it was only forty degrees . Mandy likes country music and taught Lena the two-step . Mandy makes muscles in her own thighs and slaps at them , trying to see any jiggle . <p> " I know it 's confusing , " June says . " This is such a difficult time for both of us . " <p> " Are you going to cry ? " Lena asks . She likes to know in advance so she can ready herself . The first few times she saw June cry , right after the divorce , Lena just sat there and watched her , until June said , through tears , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Would that be such a chore ? " <p> When Lena hugged her , too late , she discovered that June did n't smell the way she used to smell . She used to smell like soap and the wind , but she 'd begun to smell like coffee and old clothes and dirty hair , even though she washed her hair every day . June held her close , tightly , and Lena had to keep her body very still so as not to shrivel out of her grasp . <p> " I do n't know , " says June now . " I might cry , I might not . " <p> Lena can hear in June 's voice that it was the wrong thing to ask . <p> " Would that be OK with you , Lena , if I happened to cry about something ? Do you think you could tolerate that ? " June has indeed begun to cry . She 's doing the cry with her eyes open , where she can keep looking at Lena while the tears gather and spill out . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feels achy in the back of her neck . <p> " Oh thank you , " says June . " I try not to burden you with my problems . " She 's stopped crying . <p> For a few minutes they are silent . Lena closes her eyes . She memorizes where each thing in her room is . Her dresser under the window , her bookcase beside the bed , her trunk with the extra blankets and her summer clothes . She pictures the lamp on the dresser , the framed photos of her mother , father , and grandmother on top of the bookcase . She thinks that if she were blind she might be able to make it around the room just fine , locating each and every thing from memory , never running into corners or forgetting where she put something . <p> " Lena ? " June says . <p> Lena opens her eyes . <p> " What were you thinking ? " <p> " I do n't know , " Lena says . <p> " Just now . Tell me what you were thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I ca n't remember , " Lena says . <p> " Do you miss Daddy ? " June asks . <p> " I do n't know , " Lena says . June has asked this before , but the way things are " now " gets in the way of what Lena remembers . She talks to Patrick on the phone every other week , and it seems so long since the divorce that Lena ca n't imagine things any other way . <p> " Were you thinking about Daddy ? " June asks . She is working the Kleenex with her fingers , wadding them into a tiny ball . <p> " I was thinking what if I was blind . " <p> " And ? " June 's hands stop . <p> " That 's it , " says Lena . <p> Mrs. Shefferd tells Lena that her mother 's name was Harriet , but everyone called her Hat , even Mrs. Shefferd . <p> " She was fearless , " says Mrs. Shefferd . " Against her parents ' wishes she ran off with a boy just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like you , and only fifteen years old , and she ran with him all the way to Sandwich , New Hampshire , where they married . " <p> They are in the kitchen , standing by the sink . Mrs. Shefferd runs hot water into a glass and stirs in salt . " Gargle , " she says . <p> The boy 's name was Henry , though Mrs. Shefferd heard Hat say it only once , years later . While Lena gargles , Mrs. Shefferd tells her how Hat loved him fiercely for over two years . Then how , during their third winter , she and Henry went out onto Squam Lake to the fishing hole cut three feet across in the thinner ice out towards the middle . Closer to the shore the ice could be as thick as ten feet . They set up their poles and Hat wandered about fifty yards to watch a group of ice skaters scraping a patch of ice smooth with shovels . Then she watched them show each other how to spin , thickly graceful in their bulky clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indistinguishable from the cloudy ice , it was easy to lose time , and when Hat turned to go back to her husband , she saw only their fishing gear , their tin lunchbox , and the burlap they 'd brought to sit on . At the time she 'd been a month pregnant with Mrs. Shefferd , but she did n't know it . Hat cried out and ran , skidding in her boots , towards the hole . Without hesitation she plunged into the frigid , dark water , where she remained submerged for a full minute , looking for him , before the skaters pulled her out . <p> The skaters did n't even look for Henry . They 'd seen him leave . On the thicker ice by the shore a young woman had been learning to drive her father 's Model-A Ford . She 'd been tracing a figure eight , and Henry had gone over to have a look at the engine . The skaters said he 'd traced a couple figure eights with her , then they drove right off the ice and onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept driving to Manchester , where they lived together for years . <p> Lena spits the last of the salt water into the sink . Outside in the yard the snow has melted in muddy patches . She thinks of the nearest body of water , a reservoir across town that only freezes halfway , and that only twice or so a winter . <p> Pinned to her collar , Mrs. Shefferd wears a small plastic turkey left over from Thanksgiving . She reaches up and presses something on the turkey and the part of its body with the feathers falls open to reveal a disc of Vaseline inside . <p> " Hat just dove in after him , " Mrs. Shefferd says , absently spreading Vaseline onto her lips , offering some to Lena . " Of course he turned out to be no-count , but she thought nothing of risking life and limb . That 's just the way she was . " <p> That night June buys a beauty magazine and gives herself a facial in the bathroom . She emerges once , towel wrapped around her head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to melt the wax she uses on her upper lip . <p> Lena sits at the kitchen table , working make-up multiplication problems from school . " If you 're going to drown , " she says to June , " which do you think is better , freezing water or warm water ? " <p> " Drowning , " June says . She lowers the jar with the yellow wax into the boiling water . " Where have you heard about drowning ? " <p> " Freezing is best , " says Lena . " Your body can freeze and you can go unconscious and still live on the oxygen you already have , because you need less oxygen anyway , when you 're unconscious . " <p> " Honestly , Lena , " June says . <p> " But if you 're in warm water , or even if you 're in cold , and instead of letting yourself freeze you keep trying to breathe and stay afloat , then your lungs fill up with water . " <p> " I told Mrs. Shefferd to pay attention to what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't like for you to watch those scary movies . " <p> " It was n't a movie , " Lena says . " Mrs. Shefferd told me . " <p> " Does Mrs. Shefferd often talk about preferable ways to die ? " asks June . <p> " You do n't die if you freeze first , " says Lena . " I told you about the oxygen . " <p> " Mrs. Shefferd should be taken with a grain of salt , " June says . She lifts the pan off the burner , grabs the jar of wax with a hot mitt , and disappears into the bathroom . <p> Soon Lena has to pee , but she waits as long as she can . When she finally knocks at the door , June has taken her shirt and bra off and has packed a mud mask on her neck and upper chest . She 's been crying again-her eyes are puffy . People often say June is pretty , but at the moment her face is mottled with red fingernail prints from where she 's squeezed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started . The skin above her lip is a red strip , and she 's plucked one eyebrow almost clean away . <p> " Can I pee ? " Lena asks . <p> " Go ahead , " says June . <p> " In front of you ? " <p> June is in the habit of commenting on Lena 's body , on the future , when Lena will grow pubic hair and breasts . On June 's breasts , everything slopes down to large brown nipples , surrounded by circles of brown gooseflesh . At the thought of anything on her body resembling these , Lena shudders . <p> " Yes , in front of me , " June says . " I am your mother . It is OK for us to see each other naked . " <p> " I do n't really have to go anymore , " Lena says . June 's stomach rolls just a tiny bit where it meets her skirt . Without a bra , her nipples point to the left and right instead of straight ahead . <p> " Lena , come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right now , with me standing at the sink . It wo n't kill you . " <p> " I do n't have to , anymore , " Lena says . She backs away . <p> June sighs . She rests her fists on either edge of the sink , her head down . <p> Lena hovers in the hall in case June changes her mind . <p> " You 're shutting me out , " June finally says , stepping out into the hall . " You 're resentful and you 're shutting me out . But what did I do , Lena ? I did n't want any of this . " She is crying again . <p> " Any of what ? " Lena says . She crosses her legs in front of her . " I just have to pee . " <p> Mrs. Shefferd tells Lena how Hat stayed on in the area , birthing Mrs. Shefferd almost by herself-going just by the feel of it , she 'd never had children-just telling the neighbor woman where to grip and pull . After Mrs. Shefferd was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She liked to cut umbilical cords with a special curved knife she made herself by separating a pair of hair-cutting scissors and heating one of the blades , bending it to a curve . She originally made the knife for digging out potato eyes , but it was the first thing handy when Mrs. Shefferd came out . Hat liked how the dipping motions of a curved blade needed less resistance than cutting with a straight one . Mrs. Shefferd demonstrates this for Lena , holding her fingers in front of Lena 's face and making tiny scooping motions with her thumb . <p> " She cut the cords herself ? " Lena asks . <p> " Oh , yes , " says Mrs. Shefferd , waving her hand dismissively . " And when I was old enough to go with her she let me do it . We kept the blade sharp and sterilized and wrapped in cotton in case we had to rush out anywhere . We did other things , too . " <p> " What other things ? " Lena asks , lowering herself into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the stove for tea . <p> " Oh , this and that , " Mrs. Shefferd says . " We dug warts , pulled infected teeth . We cut off two sixth toes in the same family . " <p> Lena glances down at her feet and wiggles her toes . The kettle whistles and Mrs. Shefferd pours water into two of June 's coffee cups , over teabags she brings from home . She sits across the table from Lena and pushes a cup towards her . " Hat was very inventive , " she says thoughtfully . " I remember what she did with this growth she had , once . " Mrs. Shefferd gestures vaguely towards her stomach . <p> " What do you mean , a growth ? " Lena says . She imagines grotesque , sprouting shapes in mucous yellows . <p> " She pulled up her shirt and I saw it , sitting right there like a knob on the outside of her stomach . Like a kernel of hominy , " Mrs. Shefferd says . <p> Lena feels in the back of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone down . She is almost better , even though for the past two days she has gone without her antibiotic , miming the swallowing and bringing the pill back up with her fingers to flush down the toilet . " What 's hominy ? " she asks . <p> " A kind of cracked corn , " says Mrs. Shefferd . In the gray light from the window Mrs. Shefferd blinks . Her eyes are green , and the right has a brown spot , directly under the pupil . She begins to pick up crumbs off the vinyl placemat in front of her with her thumb and finger , collecting them in the palm of her hand . <p> " Hat called to me from the bedroom . Come here , Irene , ' she said . I went to her , and she was lying on the bed , propped up on the pillow . " Mrs. Shefferd sips her tea . The refrigerator comes on . <p> " Beside the bed Hat had a spool of white thread , " Mrs. Shefferd continues . " The strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her and she made a little loop with the thread " - Mrs . Shefferd makes an invisible loop over her tea- " and she fastened the loop onto the growth . A tiny noose . " <p> Something thrills in Lena 's stomach . She keeps her eyes on her fingernails . In bed the night before she painted her nails pink , and now she bends the tips so that the polish cracks . She has her mother 's weak nails . <p> Mrs. Shefferd describes the twisting of the thread like a tourniquet in miniature , Hat 's hands gripping a spool in the pine headboard . When it finally came off , Mrs. Shefferd says , the growth , it really came out . It had a root . <p> " Root ? " Lena says . <p> Mrs. Shefferd measures an inch on her finger with her thumb . " It looked like a bean sprout , " she says , " but thicker . A plug . " <p> " Did it bleed ? " asks Lena . <p> " Not much , " says Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lena . <p> " Oh , yes , " says Mrs. Shefferd . " But Hat was no stranger to pain . " <p> Lena closes her eyes . On television once she saw a girl with a magic watch stop time . It was before a bomb hit , and a bad thing , because everyone was stuck , but Lena thinks the girl just picked the wrong moment . Lena concentrates and pretends she can suspend time with Hat and Mrs. Shefferd , in late afternoon , the air forever still and drowsy . <p> When June comes home Lena has invited Mrs. Shefferd for dinner . She tells June this in front of Mrs. Shefferd , who has already accepted . <p> " Oh , Mrs. Shefferd , " June says . " I 'm sure you already have dinner plans . " <p> " No , " says Mrs. Shefferd . Her leopard coat and sweaters hang on the coat tree by the door in the living room , right beside where Mrs. Shefferd stands , but she makes no move to put them on . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " June tries again . At the electric company she is on the phone for a good part of the day , and her voice still sounds professional , lilting and steely . Often when someone calls in the evenings to ask her to do something she says she has to stay home with her daughter , who is sick . Lena has heard her say this even when she is n't sick . Dinner , June frequently tells Lena , is their " togethertime , " and she does n't like to have people in . <p> June tightens her mouth and lowers her eyes . It is clear she thinks Mrs. Shefferd is violating protocol . Adults should recognize when children have put their parents in uncomfortable situations . This is a situation to be excused by Mrs. Shefferd , to be gracefully bowed out of . <p> " I do n't mind , " says Mrs. Shefferd . " I was just going to make spaghetti at home . " <p> June says , " Lena , I 'll speak to you in the other room . Excuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ June sits down at the table . " Do you have any idea what I 'm going through ? " she asks Lena . " Do you ? " June 's hands shake a little-she has low blood sugar-and she rubs at her hairline with her fingertips . " Do not ever do this to me again , " June says . " Do not ever do this again . " Then she goes out to the living room and Lena hears her tell Mrs. Shefferd that it 's not a good night , that they 'll have her over for dinner some other time . <p> When Lena has been back in school for two weeks , June 's boss , who is also divorced , invites them to Ringling Brothers Barnum &; Bailey with him and his children . June sits next to her boss , and Lena sits wedged between a stranger and the boss 's littlest boy , who cries out whenever the high-flyers above let go their bars and swing and somersault through the air . Lena tells him to close his eyes , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the net below , on purpose , it seems to Lena , just to hear the crowd go , " Ooooooooh . " Lena does not like clowns , or even circuses , she discovers . The music gives her a headache . She thinks she feels the beginnings of a sore throat , but it could be the lemonade June 's boss bought for her . She does like how the woman in tights puts her head inside the lion 's jaws , but that part is quickly over . <p> Outside , on the way to the parking lot , they pass through the snake house , where a man lowers live rats into each tank to be either eaten alive , digested in rat-sized lumps concealed in the bodies of pythons , or to be struck with the fangs of cobras . " Yuck , " says June , turning away . " What a choice . " Lena leans in for a closer look . In one cage the man jerks the rat away from the cobra for the first few times , and the cobra 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of Lena 's face . <p> " How did you like the circus ? " June asks that night as they are brushing their teeth at the sink . <p> " How did you like the circus , " Lena asks instead of answering . She tries to sound interested . <p> June spits into the sink , rinses , then stands her toothbrush back in the cup . She narrows her eyes . " No , " she says . " You tell me if you liked it before you know whether <p> I liked it or not . You 're always waiting to see what you 're supposed to say . " <p> " I liked it , " Lena says , but there 's something in her voice she ca n't help . <p> " Say what you really think , " June says . <p> Lena tries to pass her and go out into the living room , but June stops her . <p> " Sit down , " she says . " We 're not finished here . " She grabs Lena 's shoulders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the closed toilet lid . " You did not like the circus ?

Gerald is June 's boss . He is a jowly , balding man who kept getting up for refreshments . " It was n't really a date . You would n't like it if I started seeing someone . Would you , Lena ? Would n't that feel strange ? " <p> Lena tries to feel strange about it . She twists her mouth to the side , thinking . She pictures Gerald standing with her mother , helping her on with her coat , and wonders if this should bother her , but she does n't feel anything . <p> " No , " Lena says , finally . <p> " Do n't just say what you think I want to hear , " June says .

You said you wanted to go to the circus . " <p> June had just brought home the tickets one day , without asking , but neither of them acknowledges this . <p> " I have a sore throat , " Lena says . <p> Lena is sick again , and the doctor says her tonsils have to come out .

In the afternoons Mrs. Shefferd and Lena open up the house and sit in the front room , drinking iced tea . <p> " Well , now , " says Mrs. Shefferd . " This I can understand . That virus stuff , that bacteria stuff is over my head , but taking something out-that 's progress . If only there was n't the hospital .

She rocks back and forth so long that Lena thinks she 's rocked herself to sleep , but then she speaks . <p> " She just changed , " says Mrs. Shefferd . " They took the stuffing out of her . The neighbors found her on the floor after I 'd been gone for two days , visiting a girlfriend , and they took her to the hospital . The doctor said she had a bad womb , a tumor , and he operated and took it out and said maybe she 'd be all right and then again maybe the cancer had gone through her body . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the operation and right after . When she ran out of it she could n't stop talking how her stomach throbbed , how numb her hands and feet had been since she 'd dove into that water years ago . She had a short finger from an accident and she said the cold bothered the skin on top of it in the winter , not to mention the joints in the rest of her body , and the heat bothered her in the summer . <p> " I understood , " says Mrs. Shefferd . " I figured she 'd feel poorly , losing her womb . But Hat knew she was a shadow of her former self , and when she saw what she 'd turned into , how every little thing bothered her if she did n't have the morphine , she got hold of some more , somehow , and did herself in . " <p> " She killed herself ? " Lena asks , holding her breath . <p> " Yes , " says Mrs. Shefferd , rocking . " Yes she did . She rathered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that would happen now . They do n't even use morphine anymore , do they ? And maybe she would have gone into herself like that anyway , I do n't know . Plain old age does some funny things . That 's nothing for you to worry about . " <p> The sun is going down and the breeze from the window begins to feel like winter again . " I do n't want to go , " Lena says . Something else , the kernel of an idea has begun to form at the back of her mind . <p> June 's car pulls in the driveway . <p> " I 'm sure everything will be fine , " says Mrs. Shefferd . " Your mother knows best . " <p> They sit in the darkening living room , listening to June 's heels clicking up the walk to the front door . <p> " You could do it , " Lena says . Her voice feels small . <p> " Oh , now , " says Mrs. Shefferd , modestly . " I do n't know about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shefferd 's expression , but after a pause she dabs at the corners of her eyes with her shirtsleeve . " Well , Lena , would you look at me , " she says , " my goodness . " <p> " Lena ? " June calls , passing by the window and peering inside . " Are these windows open ? " Lena sits very still , and June moves on to the door . <p> " Brrr , " she says upon entering . She switches on a lamp and glares at Mrs. Shefferd . " It 's freezing in here , and Lena sick , too . " <p> A week before the wedding , Patrick makes a last-ditch phone call to ask if June will change her mind and let Lena attend . June has put her foot down about this from the start-it is just too much to ask , and besides , Lena is still sick and no thanks to Mandy 's convertible . Now Lena has to have an operation . There is a long pause on the phone and June says yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stupid , but if riding around in the cold ca n't weaken someone 's resistance , what can ? She tells Patrick to call Lena during the day from now on , when she is n't home , and slams the phone into its cradle . <p> In the middle of the night Lena wakes to find her standing beside the bed . " Can I sleep with you ? " June asks . " Like I did when you were little and scared of the dark ? " <p> " I 'm not scared , " Lena says . <p> " I know . " June crawls under the covers . Lena moves over as close to the wall as she can . <p> " I 'm worried about you , Lena , " June says . " You do n't talk to me anymore . " June speaks into the dark , and Lena pretends she 's asleep . <p> " I know you 're not asleep , " June says . " When you 're sick as much as you are , sometimes there 's something else wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things . " <p> " I feel things , " Lena says . She makes her voice sleepy , even though she is wide awake and tense . <p> June turns on her side and tries to spoon Lena . <p> " I 'm hot , " Lena says , and June lies on her back again . <p> " I 'm hurting too , " June says . " I do n't want him to get married , either . " <p> " I do n't care , " Lena mumbles into her pillow . <p> " What ? " June asks . " I did n't hear you . " <p> " I do n't care if he gets married , " Lena says into the dark room . <p> " You 're angry at him , " June says . " You do n't care what he does , now . Serves him right . " <p> " Leave me alone . " Lena presses her body into the wall . " It 's not a federal case . " <p> June is very quiet . In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hears June gasp . In a few more seconds she rises and returns to her own room , leaving the door open so Lena can hear her sobs . After what seems like hours , these die into little hiccups , and then June snores . <p> Lena 's throat is hot . She creeps past June 's bedroom to the bathroom to fill her bedside glass with water . On the way back June has stopped snoring and seems to be flailing her body from one side of the bed to the other . Every few seconds she moans . Lena tiptoes to her room and sips her water . <p> She is drifting off to sleep when she hears and feels the thunk of June falling out of bed . <p> " Lena ? " June calls . Her voice is groggy . <p> Lena turns over . She can always say she did n't hear . <p> " Lena ? " June calls again , and Lena rises . <p> In June 's bedroom , Lena stands over the blurry , crumpled shape of her mother . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm sleeping , " June says from the floor . " I 'm still asleep . " <p> " Get up , " Lena says again . " Get up . " Her own voice sounds to her like barking , and she feels tears hit her neck before she knows she 's even crying . <p> " Help me , Lena , " June says , struggling to sit up . She reaches for Lena 's hand . <p> " Please , " Lena says , stepping backwards . " Please just get up . " <p> " Goddammit , Lena , " June says , fully awake now . " Just give me your hand . " <p> " No , " Lena says . She has another word , something very bad . She can not think of a word worse than the one in her mind , now on her lips . It 's a word she 's only heard one time , and even Patrick had stopped in the middle of a fight to apologize for it . It 's that bad , and Lena does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but she ca n't stop herself . The sound has already filled her mouth . <p> " Cunt . " She whispers , and even before June begins to whimper Lena is chanting " I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry . " <p> Lena knows the thing to do is kneel on the floor beside June , touch her , but June has shrunk in on herself , smaller than life , and her nightie has bunched around her waist in a way that makes touching her impossible . Lena leaves the room . <p> " So this is what it comes to , " Lena hears June say . <p> In the morning Mrs. Shefferd squirts teething gel onto a Q-tip and tells Lena to open her mouth . <p> " I borrowed this from the church nursery , " Mrs. Shefferd says . " It 'll numb things a bit . Your hands might jerk up and hit me . It 's the body 's natural reaction . You do n't want my hands to slip . " <p> Lena sits in a ladder-back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and around the slats of the back so they ca n't jerk out , and she asks Mrs. Shefferd to bind her wrists together with the curtain ties . <p> It is early , just after June has left . On the table Mrs. Shefferd has laid out the black plastic mouth wedge from Lena 's father , a bottle of Jim Beam , and Hat 's curved knife on a piece of sterile gauze . On the stove sits Lena 's goose-necked desk lamp with a sSo-watt bulb adjusted to directly over Lena 's head . The front right burner of the stove glows red , and on it rests the heating tip of a stainless steel ice pick , for cauterizing . <p> Mrs. Shefferd says they have to wait for the whiskey to take effect , for the teething gel to fully penetrate . <p> " It 'll hurt , " Mrs. Shefferd says . " It 's not everyone who can do this . " <p> Lena nods . The room begins to throb , from the whiskey . The light from the window blurs with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a thousand needles , like her feet when they 've gone to sleep . <p> Mrs. Shefferd is still talking . She 's saying how one day six years after Hat dove into the ice after her husband , he came back . Mrs. Shefferd had been watching her dice potatoes for soup when the man knocked on the door . <p> " Who is it , Irene , " Hat called , and Irene led him into the kitchen . <p> When Hat looked up , nothing registered on her face , but her hands slipped-she had poor circulation ever since the lake-and she cut off the tip of the index finger of her left hand . It was really no more than the top part of the outermost digit , halfway through the fingernail and hardly worth bothering about , though by that time doctors had begun to experiment with reconnecting appendages . In the instant before the blood started flowing , Mrs. Shefferd saw the severed part right there on the cutting board with the potatoes , like a cross-section of sausage . The man moved to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not one step closer , " she said , holding out her bloody finger . The man backed away . <p> Hat did n't even clean her finger . She said " damn , " but not harshly , more like it was all just an inconvenience , and then she lifted up the hot iron pot from the stove with her right hand . Without even flinching she pressed the open part of her finger onto the bottom of the pot . Mrs. Shefferd heard it sizzle . So did Henry . <p> " Good Christ , " he said . " Hat . " <p> Hat yelled , of course , but it was more like a triumphant battle yell than a yell of pain . Later was when Hat explained to Mrs. Shefferd about cauterizing a wound to stop the bleeding . She kept a salve on the finger and soon the wound shriveled up and the skin on either side of the tip reconnected . <p> " What was it you wanted , Henry , " Hat said as she dipped her burnt finger into a cup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instant her finger was on the pot , Hat later told Mrs. Shefferd , was the moment she forgave herself for not being smarter about picking a husband . <p> Mrs. Shefferd stops . " How 're we feeling ? " she asks Lena , and Lena blinks and nods . Mrs. Shefferd gently wedges the black plastic mouthpiece between Lena 's teeth , and Lena leans back her head against the top slat of the chair . Mrs. Shefferd takes up her mother 's blade and wipes it again on the gauze . Her left hand is cool and firm on Lena 's forehead . <p> " Now , " Lena says . Her mouth forced open , her tongue pinned down by the plastic piece , it almost does n't sound like a word ; but Mrs. Shefferd understands . <p>
