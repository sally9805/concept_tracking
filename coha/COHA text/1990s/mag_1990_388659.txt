<p> <p> How come the same liberals who damn the flag-protection amendment as " tampering with the Bill of Rights " do n't object to a " civil rights " act that repeals the presumption of innocence by statute ? <p> <p> Since George Bush did his about-face on taxes he 's finding that his fellow Republicans are giving him more trouble than the Democrats . At a recent Republican National Committee meeting in Chicago , the President was spared embarrassment when participants tabled a resolution supporting his new position rather than subject it to debate . But that 's going to be hard to repeat when the House Republican Conference takes up a resolution by Representative Dick Armey ( R. , Tex. ) putting his GOP colleagues in the House on record as opposing any tax increase to fight the deficit . The resolution has not been voted on as we go to press , but it 's expected to pass  --  which will make it difficult for the President to come back to the House with any deal that includes a tax increase . Precisely the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> <p> Keep an eye on the Republican senatorial primary race in Michigan , which will decide whether Clark Durant or Representative Bill Schuette will take on Senator Carl Levin in November . Schuette is a solid Republican ( ACU : 76 ) ; Durant is a movement conservative  --  former vice president of Hillsdale College , President Reagan 's reforming head of the Legal Services Corporation ( see NR , Aug. 5 , 1988 ) . Durant would not only join Schuette in signing the congressional Republicans ' no-new-tax pledge , he would press for further tax-rate cuts . On abortion , Schuette opposes federal funding ; Durant supports a Human Life Amendment and also , in talking to right-to-life groups , stresses the importance of offering real help to the hard cases . Senator Levin ( ADA : 80 ) will not be a pushover , and the distinction between the two challengers is nothing like that between Pierre Rinfret and Herb London in New York  --  more like that between , say , George Bush and Jack Kemp . Michigan Republicans may find that enough of a difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S &L; culprits  --  Alan Cranston comes to mind  --  are rushing to reform campaign-financing laws so that " it wo n't happen again " see " S &L; for Scandal , " p. 13 . We might usefully recall that the last major wave of campaign reform , in the early Seventies , gave us political-action committees . The heart of the matter , which none of these reforms addresses , is that the Federal Government has been growing steadily for almost sixty years , cancerously so for at least 25 . Ronald Reagan just slowed things down . If you ca n't opt out of the redistribution game , some are bound to decide , better make friends with the referees . ( Rupert Murdoch , former owner of a Boston TV station , learned what happens when you annoy Ted Kennedy . ) The influence of money on politics is directly related to the influence of politics on money . When politicians have their hands on billions , buying a politician becomes a very good investment . Reforms that try to restrict access to the commodity of political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market . The only real solution is to reduce the value of the commodity : reduce the power of government . <p> <p> The management of the Republican Party has been cowed by the media attack on the Willie Horton TV spots . Of course , the Willie Herren spots were accurate : he is a murderer and a rapist , and he was furloughed by the Dukakis administration in Massachusetts . But what about Dianne Feinstein ? In a hot primary contest for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in California , she made the RNC types look like civics teachers . She slugged her opponent , John Van de Kamp , with the Hillside Strangler , a serial killer of a decade ago : her ads featured the bagged body of one of the killer 's victims , and the voiceover stated that District Attorney Van de Kamp had not prosecuted the Strangler . Miss Feinstein Hortonized Van de Kamp , and won going away . Was she criticized for " negative campaigning " ? Are you kidding ? She 's " feisty " and " charismatic . " <p> <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black-and-white television sets that cost the equivalent of ten months ' salary , the people of Albania are beginning to stir . Over the past several weeks , more than four thousand have evaded flurries of gunfire , storming embassy compounds in the capital city of Tirana with hopes of gaining asylum . The audible consternation from within Albania and diplomatic pressure from Western European countries whose embassies are under siege have forced the hand of Ramiz Alia , whose totalitarian regime has issued passports to those fortunate enough to make it to embassy grounds . Thus far , 3,700 have been allowed to leave , first to Italy , but with connections to Germany and France . The stories told by the refugees are your basic Stalinist fare : brutally repressed religion , censored speech , torture by police , with the added attraction of one month per year in a labor camp for all individuals between the ages of 15 and 26 . But events are following a by-now familiar pattern , and Alia may soon learn the consequences of allowing a little water over the dam . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene , looking toward eventual black participation , Nelson Mandela 's African National Congress  --  committed to violent revolution and to the collectivist economics that have laid waste so much of Africa  --  was doing its best to position itself as the only game in town for those who could not bring themselves to support the ruling National Party . Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi has now undercut the ANC 's attempt by announcing the formation of a pro-free-market , anti-sanctions , multiracial political party , the Inkatha Freedom Party . There is some doubt that the new party , with its roots so firmly in the Zulu tribe , will attract many non-Zulus to its banners . But the move should make it impossible to freeze Buthelezi out of any coming negotiations . The chief is a completely credible opponent of apartheid ; for example , he refused to negotiate with the government until it released Nelson Mandela . Mandela , on the other hand , has since spurned him on orders from the ANC leadership . Buthelezi takes orders from no one , so do n't expect to see him on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were put in jail and a democracy movement that brought peaceful demonstrators into the streets of Rangoon and other Burmese cities was crushed two years ago with at least as much brutality as Comrade Deng used against the democracy movement in Tiananmen Square nine months later . Because TV cameras were not in place , however , or possibly because no one has cared for a long , long time what happens in Burma , there was no international outcry at the killings and jailings . Confident of its control , the ruling military junta scheduled elections this spring . It was a big mistake . The spark of freedom ignited by Solidarity a decade earlier and half a world away is proving unquenchable . Two-thirds of the people of Burma went to the polls and voted out the gangsters . Whether they will go is another question . But if we were in Deng 's shoes , what happened in Burma would cause us a frisson or two . <p> <p> From an October 13 , 1988 , letter by George Bush to Povilas Janciauskas , an officer of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Journal : " Freedom is not a privilege it is a human right . The United States has always condemned the violation of your national sovereignty , and in the years ahead it will never condone the forced occupation of Lithuania by the Soviet Union . To do so would be to turn our backs on our own values and heritage . As a nation born out of a struggle against tyranny , Americans should never apologize for helping others win their freedom and I never will . And so , as we enter the final stretch of the campaign , I would respectfully request that you support my candidacy . " <p> <p> There is a lot of discussion these days about animal experimentation for medical and other purposes . The issue is not about to go away , and it should be addressed intelligently on a case-by-case basis . Much of such research is justified . On the other hand , much appears to be frivolous and undertaken as an aspect of grantsmanship ; if appearances are correct , such " research " wastes taxpayers ' money , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given in Animal Experimentation : The Consensus Changes ( Chapman and Hall ) , was it really necessary to place one hundred newborn lambs in a freezing chamber to determine that sheep vary in their resistance to cold ? A critical review of such experimentation is as valid as a critical review of public money for Mapplethorpe and Serrano . <p> <p> The New Jersey Supreme Court Task Force on Women in the Courts , set up to " examine gender bias in the judiciary , " is recommending that the use of pronouns be banned in the New Jersey judiciary . In the interest of recognizing " each individual 's abilities , life experiences , and aspirations , " six pages of linguistic restrictions have been outlined . Really , it 's not at all surprising : the only thing not protected by the First Amendment these days is speech . <p> <p> " The market is not an invention of capitalism .
