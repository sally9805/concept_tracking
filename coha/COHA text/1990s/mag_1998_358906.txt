In his elegy on the death of Yeats , W.H. Auden wrote that " poetry makes nothing happen " and added , " It survives , / A way of happening , a mouth . " This sentiment seems a long step down from Shelley 's 19th century claim that poets are " the unacknowledged legislators of the world . " But both statements add up to the same thing : the practical life of getting and spending needs , however grudgingly , the exhilaration and consolation of poetry , of memorable speech , of words striving to be true to themselves . The 20th century perfected the hard sells of propaganda and advertising , but talented people still worked to keep their language pure . They made nothing happen except the enrichment of their readers ' lives .  --  By Paul Gray <P> WILLIAM BUTLER YEATS ( 1865-1939 ) He was temperamentally a Romantic , eager for seclusion : " I will arise and go now , and go to Innisfree . " But public life would not let him . Whatever his subject  --  his native @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe  --  he turned current events into lasting art . In the aftermath of World War I , he pronounced a memorable verdict : " Things fall apart ; the center can not hold ; / Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world . " <P> ROBERT FROST ( 1874-1963 ) His invitation to read at John F. Kennedy 's 1961 Inauguration only confirmed his status as the nation 's most widely recognized poet . That popularity stemmed largely from his readability ; his poetry seemed to speak plainly , in rhyme . But his surfaces concealed depths . The line " And miles to go before I sleep " at first seems straightforward . Repeated immediately , the words convey a trip toward death . <P> W.H. AUDEN ( 1907-1973 ) The most technically adroit poet of his era , he dazzled readers when his works first appeared in the late 1920s . He struck a distinctive postwar note . His landscapes bristled with rusting machinery and ominous border crossings . He could be chatty : " Let me tell you a little story . " He shied away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjectives : " Lay your sleeping head , my love , / Human on my faithless arm . " <P> SYLVIA PLATH ( 1932-1963 ) The searing poems she wrote just before her suicide in 1963 made her a literary and feminist martyr . Her onetime mentor Robert Lowell described her last works as " playing Russian roulette with six cartridges in the cylinder . " Plath 's poem to her long-dead father redefined confessional writing : " Every woman adores a Fascist , / The boot in the face , the brute/ Brute heart of a brute like you . " <P> ALLEN GINSBERG ( 1927-1997 ) He emerged during the somnolent American 1950s as a bardic reincarnation of Walt Whitman . His incantatory , long-lined verses were styled not for parlor reading or classroom study but for public performances , featuring himself . He provided the music for the Beat Generation and a vision of modern malaise : " I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness . "                  @ @ @
