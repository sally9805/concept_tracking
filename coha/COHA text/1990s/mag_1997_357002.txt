The distinctive black-and-white sweater-striped pill was supposed to make millions of Americans thin  --  and its manufacturer rich . But a year after the drug called Redux was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for sale in the U.S. , the hot new diet pill has fallen short on both counts . At $200 million a year , sales are flat and lagging far behind the initial $1 billion-a-year expectations . Some who have taken Redux have discovered that it is not the magic melting potion they hoped it would be ; others who were thinking of taking it have been frightened off by stories about potentially harmful side effects  --  including a news report ( later proved false ) that a woman had died after taking Redux . <P> There is more bad news to come . Last month the FDA received a letter signed by several dozen neuroscientists blasting the agency for not opening up the post-approval monitoring process more fully . The FDA , these doctors charge , continues to ignore animal tests that suggest prolonged use of Redux can destroy nerve tissue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has serious brain toxicity , " says Dr. Mark Molliver of the Johns Hopkins Medical School . " It has the potential for producing brain damage . " <P> In some respects Redux has been a victim of its own early success . The first new antiobesity medication in more than 20 years , the drug enjoyed one of the fastest launches in pharmaceutical history . Both the FDA and Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories , which markets Redux , knew about the possibility of brain damage at high doses . But they also knew people who are morbidly obese  --  individuals who weigh 30% more than average  --  face even greater risks that they will die young from heart disease , diabetes or stroke . " We made the decision that the benefits outweigh the risks , at least for the population we identified , " says Dr. James Bilstad , the FDA official who oversees drugs for metabolic disorders . <P> Still , the FDA was not entirely satisfied , and as a condition of approval it required that Wyeth-Ayerst conduct a follow-up study to determine whether Redux users were suffering any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company has been dragging its feet . Wyeth-Ayerst , for its part , says it is pleased with Redux 's sales and is ready to start the tests , but that the FDA still has not decided how the study should be designed . <P> In the meantime , the drug has become a magnet for bad press  --  most of it unwarranted , if not downright false . In February , after the FDA met behind closed doors with officials from Wyeth-Ayerst to iron out details of the follow-up study , critics cried " cover-up "  --  as if the FDA never granted drug companies private meetings in order to protect trade secrets . In April the Associated Press reported that a 38-year-old , 120-lb. woman had died after taking Redux for just a few days . It turned out that she weighed 220 lbs . and was in fact murdered  --  a turn of events that can hardly be blamed on the diet pill . The AP issued a correction , but the damage to the drug 's image had been done . <P> Bad press can , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surmounted . Failing to deliver is another matter . " It just does n't seem to work that well , " says Dr. Richard Joseph , an obesity expert in Naperville , Ill . " I consider only a few of my patients Redux success stories . "
