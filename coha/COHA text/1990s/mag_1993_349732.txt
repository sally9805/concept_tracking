It was a rainy Friday afternoon in the New Jersey resort town of Stone Harbor , so an extended family of eight went to see The Fugitive . During the scary parts , Elizabeth , 85 , clutched the hand of her daughter-in-law Mary , 48 , who enjoyed the movie 's gloss on a favorite old TV show . The cat-and-mouse interplay of hunter and haunted had Trish , 26 , scraping the polish off her fingernails . Craig , 12 , appreciated the cinematic ingenuity of the mise en scene . And everybody loved the train wreck . The whole family had a good time at the movies . Maybe they 'll all do it again real soon . <P> People of all ages are getting the moviegoing habit this summer . Over Memorial Day weekend , Sylvester Stallone went sky-high with Cliffhanger , but that was just a sneak preview of the sweltering summer box office . In June , Steven Spielberg 's Jurassic Park , which will soon become the second highest- grossing film in history ( after Spielberg 's E.T. ) , got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and kept coming back . Sleepless in Seattle enticed the cooing couples . The Firm , In the Line of Fire and Rising Sun proved there was a huge July audience for old-fashioned suspense films . And now The Fugitive , which opened to the largest August weekend business ever , seems sure to fill seats through Labor Day and beyond . <P> Wait a minute .

Were n't the studios primed for pint-size blockbusters about 12-year-old emotional overachievers ? Well , yes  --  and the kids are at the movies too . Free Willy ( a boy and his whale ) has struck a heart chord ; this inexpensive tearjerker will earn about $80 million . Rookie of the Year ( a boy and his fastball ) and Dennis the Menace ( a boy and his grandparent surrogate ) have won solid numbers , and Searching for Bobby Fischer ( a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids are seeing the 1937 Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs to make it Disney 's top film of the summer .

In fact , they took their teenagers as well  --  probably in separate cars  --  to films that cut across generational chasms . " Someone called me yesterday , " says Fugitive director Andrew Davis , " whose nine-year-old loved it . " Nora Ephron , director of Sleepless in Seattle , surmises that her audience is " grownups  --  over 18s , anyway  --  and more females than males . But when you get up to where we are , everybody is going to see it . " Wolfgang Petersen , whose In the Line of Fire is in the same box-office stratosphere as Sleepless , has similar anecdotal evidence . " At the theaters , " he says , " I found not only the 18-to-50-year-olds , but people much older than that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
