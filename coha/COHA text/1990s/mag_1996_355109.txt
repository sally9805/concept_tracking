Compiling a list of the most influential people in America , besides being a provocative parlor game , provides a chance to mull over the ideas and visions , tastes and beliefs that affect our lives . Being influential is the reward of successful salesmanship , the validation of personal passion , the visible sign of individual merit . It is power without coercion , celebrity with substance . <P> It can take the form of mass impact . Martha Stewart 's inexhaustible brand of domesticity claims a sizable audience . So do Jerry Seinfeld 's small-bore irony and Oprah Winfrey 's irresistible empathy . There is influence within a creative field . Hence the architect Frank Gehry and the **36;4246;TOOLONG Courtney Love . And there is proximity to power , at least when it is enjoyed by people with ideas and issues they know how to push . It 's largely by this means that Al Gore , who is supposed to be in a no-influence job , is n't . ( Sorry , Bill  --  you 're merely powerful . ) <P> Because influence is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of official Washington is not on this list . Nor is this a list of heroes . Colin Powell , a legitimate hero , has been influential in the past and has the potential to be so again , but for now he 's taking time off . Meanwhile , Louis Farrakhan , who to most people is no hero , is busily influencing people . It is also not a list celebrating celebrity . Dennis Rodman is famous , but we 'll have to wait for a lot more killer-tomato dye jobs to show up in the N.B.A. before he ranks as an influence . ( Stay tuned . ) And because influence is n't always , alas , the same thing as talent and virtue , a lot of gifted and good people do n't make the cut . <P> After much consultation , argument and people wandering in saying , " Yeah , but what about so-and-so ? , " the editors and staff of TIME have chosen 25 men and women as the most influential people in America . To those who think other candidates deserved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next time around .
