I will begin on holy Thursday in the Christian year 1487 , Eastertide for the Christians , Passover for the Jews , a perilous time for all . Until that day I had lived the eight years of my life in a child 's paradise . On Passover eve Fra Bernardino da Feltre preached an Easter sermon in the town of Mantova . After that day nothing was ever the same again . The day began for me and my little brother in the ordinary way . Awakened at cock 's crow by the slave girl Cateruccia , who slept at the foot of our bed , we washed up , said our prayers , and went on to Mama 's room for a sweet bun and some watered wine . This repast had been added to the household routine the year before on the advice of the humanist physician Helia of Cremona . According to him a small amount of bread and wine at the beginning of the day gave protection against the plague by heating the stomach , thus strengthening it against disease . Since few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinnertime , this extra meal gave our famiglia a certain notoriety among those whose minds and habits were mired in the Dark Ages . But our parents were adherents of all things modern and humanistic . They believed in the superiority of the ancients , the beauty of the human body , and the new educational methods of Maestro Vittorino . Not for them the rabbinical axiom " First the child is allured ; then the strap is laid upon his back . " Our tutor was never permitted to use the rod . Out of respect to the wisdom of the ancients , daily exercise was as faithfully adhered to as daily prayers . Mens sana in corpore sano . Even on Passover eve , we made our daily pilgrimage to the Gonzagastud where our family had permission to ride , Jehiel and I on our pony , Papa on a black Araby stallion looking every bit the great lord in his sable-trimmed cloak . We often saw the young Marchese , Francesco Gonzaga , gallop by although he rarely troubled himself to acknowledge us . However , that morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom he called Maestro Daniele , a term of some respect . It was not a long audience . Francesco Gonzaga always preferred to converse with dogs and horses rather than people . But his demeanor that day was remarkably agreeable . He even had a smile for us . I thought he must be amused by the way we rode our pony , I in the saddle and Jehiel on pillion , contrary to the usual arrangement for boys and girls . Whatever his reasons , to me it was as if one of the gods had descended from heaven and smiled on us . I did n't even notice how ugly he was . To my surprise , Papa introduced Jehiel to the Marchese by the name Vitale . I now know that Vitale is what Christians call all Jews named Jehiel , in the odd belief that they are translating the name directly from Hebrew into Italian , since Jehiel means " light " in Hebrew and Vitale means " light " in the Italian vernacular . My name , as is almost always the case with women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precise distinctions are not necessary in the naming of girls . As for Jehiel , he was as perplexed to hear himself called Vitale as I. I think my brother had never heard his Christian name before . But he responded with a modest bow like a perfect little gentleman . And I bowed too since no one had taught me how to curtsy while seated on a pony . Again , the Marchese smiled . A fine beginning for Passover eve . But on the way home , when we attempted to cross the Piazza delle Erbe , three barefoot Franciscan brothers appeared out of nowhere to bar our way , cursing us for infidel Jews . The sainted Bernardino da Feltre was preaching in the square that day . How dare we trespass on this holy Christian event ? We looked to Papa to put these cheeky priests in their place . Instead , he nodded courteously , reversed his mount , and led us home by way of San Andrea . As we approached our stable , he did make a halfhearted jest about barefoot priests but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The maids had worked far into the night cleaning and plucking chickens and fowl and skewering them onto the great spit . And when we entered the house , the steaming kettle was beginning to release into the air that heavenly scent of figs and cinnamon that issues from the Passover pudding and fills the house with its fragrance as it cooks . Dinner consisted of minestra and bread  --  scanty fare at our table , but no one complained . They knew they would feast that night at the seder . But as the soup was being served , Monna Matilda , the shohet 's wife , rose to her feet , her beard hairs bristling , to challenge my father . " Why were we not told that da Feltre was engaged to preach in our city this day , Ser Daniele ? " she demanded on behalf of the assembled household . " And what is being done to protect the safety of this famiglia ? " I swear to God if the geyser at Vesuvius had erupted , that woman would have blamed it on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tolerant , man , kept a special store of patience in reserve for Monna Matilda . " I well understand your fears , good woman , " he began sweetly . " Remember , I have little ones of my own and a wife in a delicate condition . " " Exactly . " Monna literally preened her breast with pride at having been vindicated . " I know you will be pleased to hear that this very morning I held a discussionon the matter with Marchese Francesco . " A restrained gasp went up among the diners at the mention of the title . True , Marchese Francesco Gonzaga was yet young , but in the Mantovan territory he shone with a luster equal to that of the Pope , the Emperor , or the great kings of Europe . " The young Marchese was most gracious , as always , " Papa reported . " He understands our unease . He is aware of what happened at Trento , even though he was a boy at the time . " At the mention of Trento , all heads dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us from it " were heard all around . " At the same time , " Papa continued , ignoring the bowed heads , " the Marchese urges us to remember that his family has a long and close association with Fra . Bernardino . Thus , to use his own words , he must pick his way carefully between his loyalty to a valued family friend and his duty to preserve the civil peace of Mantova . " " Does that mean , " Davide , our tutor , asked in a quavering voice , " that the Marchese will allow this friar to preach against us in Mantova as he did at Trento ? " " Not a bit of it , " Papa answered with a smile of satisfaction . " He has given me his personal assurance that the friar is strictly prohibited from preaching against the Jews in this territory . In his own words , ' There will be no rabble-rousing in Mantova as long asFrancesco Gonzaga rules here . Nor will we permit anyone to interfere with our Jews . ' " " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daniele ? " asked the old rabbi . " I do , Rov Isaac , " Papa replied respectfully . " Christians have broken their promises in the past ... " the old man reminded him . " So they have , " interrupted Dania , the tutor 's wife . Rabbi Isaac silenced her with a glare . The old man had no regard for the opinion of any woman . " I was inquiring of Ser Daniele , who knows the Gonzagas well  --  the late father as well as this young son  --  if he rests content with their assurance of our safety . " " I have a particular reason to depend upon the protection of the Gonzaga family , Rov Isaac , " was Papa 's reply . " A reason that extends beyond their promises . " In fairness to Papa , he did have a good reason  --  a hidden reason  --  to put his trust in the Gonzagas ' promise of protection . It seems that the young Marchese 's grandfather , Lodovico Gonzaga , had initiated the practice of investing a sizable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose of sharing in the high interest rate that he permitted us to charge . Put bluntly ,
