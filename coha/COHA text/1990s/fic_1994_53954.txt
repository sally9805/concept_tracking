Section : A SCIENTIST 'S NOTEBOOK SCIENCE was invented once , and only once . <p> This is a singularly striking fact of human history . There were many opportunities for science to emerge , in the sense that we know it  --  the reasonably dispassionate search for objective , checkable troths about the physical world . The Egyptians and Babylonians had lots of rule-of-thumb engineering and geometry . The Romans could build magnificently . The Chinese invented paper , gunpowder , rockets , the great sailing vessels of the Ming era . <p> Yet none devised the rather abstract rules which govern scientific discourse . No rival to Euclid 's Elements . No deductive mathematics . No Chinese or Indian or African theorems or proofs before they learned from Euclid . <p> Indeed , truly modern science emerged only half a millennium ago . The term " science , " from the Latin , " to know , " is less than two centuries old . Before that science existed but was called " natural philosophy . " Science as we know it came at the hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great experimenters , Galileo and his contemporaries . The crowning jewel was the systematic , mathematical description of the most classically serene part of the world , celestial dynamics , by Newton . <p> They all built on the Greeks , who invented the basic idea of the method . Along the shore of that rough peninsula , over two thousand years ago , the methods of careful reasoning , always braced by consultation with the facts of the matter , evolved and won through . <p> Not that all Greeks held to it , of course . Aristotle lusted after the great intellectual leaps . He was impatient with facts and seldom checked his many assertions . Simple enough , one would think , to see if a heavy ball of the same size as a light one fell to earth at a different rate . But it was nearly two thousand years before Galileo looked to see , and found the truth . <p> I loved Greece and was immediately drawn to it . My first visit there led to an entire novel about Mycenean archeology , Artifact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and live in Laguna Beach , California now because I simply love the rub and scent of the sea . More , I admire the cutting clarity of the air  --  sharper than the Gulf coast where I grew up , but sharing a smell of brine and eternal organic consequence . <p> I sometimes think that the Greeks developed their Euclidean certainties , their sharp visions of cause and circumscribed effect , because they lived in an air of razor clarity . The dry , lucid accuracies of Athenian air may have kindled in the ancient mind some vision of a realm beyond the raw rub of the day , a province of the eternal which obeyed finer laws , more graceful dynamics . <p> I thought this particularly because I was preparing , in late October of 1993 , the notes for a course in ethics which I would soon teach in the honors humanities program at the University of California , Irvine . ( Usually ethics is strictly a matter for the humanists , but for the past five years I have served as the token scientist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strongly Plato believed in smooth certainties lying behind our rude world , the famous shadows on the cave wall analogy . Socrates believed in higher ethical laws , too , which men could but crudely glimpse and try to copy . Idealism emerged in the sharp air of civilization 's morning . <p> Somehow that city-state of a quarter million population produced an immense flowering in art , literature , philosophy- and science . Many cultures yield up art , music , and higher thought generally . But only the Greeks put together science . I wondered why . <p> I saw the smoke as I went to my one PM lecture on a blustery Wednesday , October 27 . The spire of oily black smoke was about seven miles inland , I judged , near the freeway , far from my home in Laguna Beach . Dry winds off the desert called the Santa Anas brought an eerie , skin-prick-ling apprehension to the sharp air . <p> By the time I had held forth on turbulence theory for an hour and a half , a dark cloud loomed across all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sea . On the telephone my wife Joan said the smell was already heavy and asked me to come home . <p> I tried to reach Laguna Beach by the Pacific Coast Highway , only to be turned back by a policeman at the campus edge . So I went south , looping the long way around , leaving the freeway and threading through surface streets . When I had bought my Mercedes 560 SL my son had deplored its excess power , quite ecologically unsound , and I had replied lightly that I wanted to " seize opportunities . " Here was the chance : I cut through traffic , hoping to get ahead of the predictable wedge wanting the only access to town . <p> I failed , of course . Traffic was chaotic . I took two hours to reach Monarch Bay , the community immediately south of Laguna Beach . At Monarch Bay the police stopped everyone . Smoke glowered across the entire horizon now . <p> I left my car at 5:30 and hiked north , striking up a conversation with a man , Dave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I stopped there for a drink and heard that the high school had burned . Our house sits three hundred meters above the school . On the other hand , this was media wisdom , instantly discounted . I went on , hitchhiking and walking the five miles to central Laguna by seven PM . Police were turning everyone back but the acrid flavor in the air alarmed me , and the dark clouds blowing thickly out to sea seemed to come from our hill . The police stopped me several times . I always retreated , then worked my way around to another street and went on . <p> I knew that Joan must have evacuated by then , but I had set out to come home and just kept at it , through the gathering pall . Maybe there was something I could do - fight the fire , water down the yard , rescue some precious memories ... <p> On Wendt Street , near the high school , a police car came cruising down , herding the few homeowners left . I ducked behind a stone wall . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a headphone radio shouted at me . He waved a pistol wildly  --  a part of me noted , . $2 revolver , finger on the trigger guard , probably knows how to handle it  --  and I realized he perhaps mistook me for a looter . I ran behind the police car and down a street , following the narrow windings toward our hill . Night had fallen . <p> I sprinted on  --  excited , oblivious to choking smoke , sirens and hoarse cries . At the high school - untouched , of course  --  I met fire teams and more police . Chaos . Flames leapt from our hill , a steady popping roar . Homes exploded in orange as their roofs burst open . Yellows and reds traced out the dark discords of walls collapsing , brush crackling , cinders churning up in cyclonic winds , orange motes in a fountain of air - then falling , bright tumbling fireworks . Ash swept through the streets like gray snow . Above it all a cowl of black smoke poured out to sea . <p> I crossed the street and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see far enough up Mystic Canyon to make out our house . But all around it homes burned furiously . Our street , Skyline Drive , was a flaming artery both above and below our house . <p> A fire warden shouted at me to get out . I hesitated , he shouted again , and I realized it was all over . At last I gave up our house and turned away . I had been rushing forward for several hours , intent on reaching home . That was impossible . I could do nothing in this inferno . I had not gotten in anybody 's way , but I had n't done any good , either . Working my way this close to the fires was risky , if only from the smoke I inhaled . Slowly I realized that I had been running on automatic , and all this was quite foolish . <p> I retreated through deserted streets . I hitchhiked partway back out and a few miles south found a 7-Eleven open . An incongruous sight , bright beacon beside the exodus . I was parched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to get a big container of cold tea . <p> The store owner was in a heated argument with two men who wanted to get gasoline . Police had come by and ordered the pumps closed . Excited , the owner started rattling off Korean and one of the men grabbed him by the shin collar and pulled him halfway across the counter . More shouting . The owner got free and backed away and the rest of us in the store yelled at the two men . They swore at the owner but made no more moves . <p> Plenty of talk then , accusations and retorts and barks of angry egos . I judged it was not going to get any worse so I left money on the counter and walked out with the tea . A block further south six motorcycle police from Newport Beach sat on their machines and watched people still leaving along the Coast Highway , their uniforms pressed and neat . They were n't interested in the 7-Eleven . <p> I finished the tea before I reached the Adams home . They all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My thirst would not go away . I sat and listened to the announcer declare that all homes in the Mystic Hills were lost . All . Confirmation sent me into a daze . <p> I called friends , who reported that Joan had indeed evacuated town and come to them , and then went on to the refugee center . Dave Adams drove me to the center and I found Joan . She was in better shape mentally and physically than I. I sat on a curb and ate my first fast food burger ever , from a free canteen run by In ' n Out . It was improbably delicious . <p> Joan had evacuated as flames marched over the ridge line of the hill across the street , coming as fast as a person walks . She had stuffed her Volvo with financial documents , vital but small items like safety deposit keys , passports and telephone directories , plus our photo albums , the oldest of our Japanese woodblock prints , jewelry , and cherished oddments of our accumulated history . <p> She had been putting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked if she needed help loading things in the car . She suspected he was in fact interested in getting into the house , so said no thanks . He ambled away . Just as she was ready to slam the trunk closed , our postman pulled up , looking rather anxious . She took the day 's mail , jumped into the car , and headed downhill . People were barreling down at high speed . The postman followed her out , stopping to deliver to homes which were soon to burn , flames approaching behind him . At the time , she said , it did not occur to her to laugh . Later , she did . <p> A police chaplain came by and we talked about losing the house . I could n't seem to get my mind around the concept . We were leaving the center to go back to the friends when a neighbor called to us . He had lost his house , his classic car collection included . But he had seen our house standing at nine PM , he was pretty sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though , without street lights . This heartened us greatly but I had severe doubts that anything could have survived the furnace I had seen . <p> We reached friends , an Episcopal minister and wife , at midnight . We slept solidly until six PM . Up , talk , news on TV  --  which I found oddly uninteresting , and distrusted . Breakfast out . I always eat a lot in the morning , having grown up in farm country , and this time ordered double . The restaurant seemed eerie in its calm . Pancakes and omelettes , the fire only a rank smell from distant hills . <p> Back to the center , where we wore away the day vainly seeking news . Nobody released any information on homes burned . News programs dwelt infuriatingly on the spectacular wasteland at the top of our hill , never letting the helicopter camera angle descend to take in lower Skyline Drive . Reports continued that everything had burned on Skyline . I was inclined to believe them , though I kept saying encouraging things to all I talked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free . I distracted myself by searching for clothes in the immense piles donated by charitable groups . I was still wearing the shorts and short-sleeved shirt I had been lecturing in , what seemed a year ago . <p> At four PM word came that since all fires were out we could go back into town . We left , I picked up my car , and we edged our way into Laguna . Behind me , out of my sight , Joan 's Volvo overheated , stranding her for nearly two hours on Coast Highway . <p> Dusk fell as I reached the high school again , only to be blocked by police . Nobody allowed on the hill . Nope , not even residents . They were trying to prevent looting . Grim warnings . <p> I simply could not turn back . This was my neighborhood and I knew the short cuts . I slipped around the police lines , over ash-covered tennis courts , along a path and up through several burned homes , on to Skyline . Several news teams were arrayed among the ruins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Media okay , but homeowners keep out . <p> Melted cars and ashy gray debris littered Skyline . Cables down , charred palm trees . A heavy acrid stench made me cough . I walked uphill and around a curve . Amid the black ruins our house stood untouched . I approached in a daze . The battle to save it was visible only in fire hoses left in the street , boot prints in the yard and minor damage to plants . <p> Two doors were unlocked , one ajar . Inside , the smoky stink could not blanket my immediate reaction : home . Safe . Numbly I collected some floppy disk backups from my study . Pointless , but automatic . Our fireproof safe stood with both drawers yawning open . I took it all in but was n't thinking much . <p> I departed in the gathering gloom . The street outside was covered with ash and burnt scraps . Somehow I did n't want to leave the hill , even in the gloom . I could not comprehend the enormity of others ' loss , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me when they found I could speak German . Crisis surrealism ; a foreign tongue that recalled war zone damage . <p> Still dazed , I wondered where Joan was . Turned out she had been exhausted by the overheated car and traffic , and stopped at a friend 's . She was quite wrung out . We finally linked up again and spent the night at a nearby friend 's house . The next day , Friday , we even got into our house . About eighty percent of the neighborhood was gone , 199 homes , probably $200 million lost . In the whole town over 350 burned , with losses around $500 million . <p> The water had run out again and again through the long fight . Fire-men had been forced to abandon whole blocks to the swift flames . Around our group of a dozen homes they had drawn a perimeter and defended , using the hydrant across the street from us , which had high pressure . They worked around the houses , trampled vegetation , got the job done . The flames had come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the curb across the street from our house . <p> Then the fire worked south , burning all the homes downhill from us , and leaped Skyline . It burned a dozen more homes below and then crawled up our canyon to within thirty meters of our house . The fire-men hit the flames with a 500 gallon-per-minute , precision high-velocity cannon . After several hours that did it . Our canyon was a black pit . <p> Apparently the initial small fire far inland was set by someone , the media said . I did n't care much for these larger views ; my focus had narrowed to the local , intense present . Time to clean up . Our unlocked doors apparently were the firemen 's work , checking for people unable to get out . Joan had left our safe closed , but not locked . A looter had come through and checked it , finding only financial papers . He took nothing . That must have been while the police cordon kept out homeowners , but not entrepreneurs ready for the quick take . <p> Wildlife had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hills beyond a walk through the black slopes came to a twisted wire fence . Against it was a line of white bones , the lizards and rabbits and snakes and rats and deer that had run in blind panic into it and turned to face the onrushing wall of heat . <p> I trapped a two-pound rat in our tool shed , and saw rats the size of cats jumping between palm trees . From our deck we watched hawks diving at mice as they scampered for shelter on the bare hillsides . We put out seed and water and birds flocked  --  gnatcatchers , hummingbirds , red-tailed hawks , crows , brilliantly hued mountain bluebirds . <p> Two Dalmatians were found roaming , having somehow escaped their burning house . Boaters three miles offshore saw an exhausted mule deer doe swimming out to sea , away from the blighted canyons where she usually foraged . They hauled her in and brought her back for care . On the canyons , gray tree frogs turned spontaneously black , closely matching the charred ground . Somewhere in their genes lies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ response to give them protection from predators , somehow triggered by the sight or smell of the flames . <p> All this seemed very distant , in the immense relief at being among the survivors . Our house was not particularly expensive , but what really matters , I came to feel , was how much of yourself you had put into your home . Neighbors recently moved in walked away from their ruins with apparently some aplomb . Oldtimers were more devastated . <p> We both slept poorly for several nights , chased by phantom flames in repeating dream dramas . Those who had lost everything were forlorn , adrift . When the Santa Ana winds picked up again , one woman who had been evacuated in the fire began automatically loading her car with cherished photographs . Some elderly couples developed the habit of taking their dearest possessions with them everywhere they went . <p> Counselors at the Community Clinic spoke of " post traumatic stress disorder " and of conducting " critical incident stress debriefings " but the phenomena they tried to capture with such jargon was real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the unsettled mind of one who has been shot at and barely missed . <p> As a scientist I habitually saw cause and effect , but the random nature of the world had asserted itself here . Much of our culture devotes itself obsessively to the comfy human world , our gossip and relationships and destinies . Now we had all been reminded that the world itself neither likes nor dislikes us ; worse , in a way , it is indifferent . The fire had no point , no target in itself  --  though whoever started it probably did . However much I believed as a scientist in an objective , unconcerned universe out there , which we study to understand , my emotions veered away from that . <p> The calamity had missed us by a hair . We had fireproofed the roof with concrete tile five years before , recoated with thick fire-resistant paint in 1992 , and the morning of the fire had a garden crew clearing out the volatile underbrush . They had fled only when the flames danced above the ridgeline , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but we were hugely lucky , too . <p> We had already been through the slide and burning in our little canyon in January 1993 , which took out the three homes immediately below us . The immensely larger ferocity of this catastrophe was numbing . A week later , a sudden rain flooded out the five surviving homes across the street . Sandbags in our driveway deflected the ash-laden streams from us . The big storms of winter were worse . <p> I missed no classes and got back to research soon . But my thinking was unsettled and in reading Plato I found a curious dislocation . <p> An unbroken tradition stretches from Pythagoras and his theorems to Copernicus and his planetary circles . But for most of the 1300 years between them , astrology dominated civilization 's attitude toward the heavens . Astrology takes a more warm , comfy view of the sky , makes it human-centered . <p> Greek geometry and deductive thought were unique inventions , never duplicated by other cultures . The very notion that the cosmos is ultimately open to reason comes naturally only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greek patterns of thinking barely escaped the turmoil of intervening millennia , and if lost would probably never have been reinvented . <p> Did Euclidean certainties come in part from an unconscious association with the clarity of air and sea and crisp , dry land ? I had noted the similar feel to California and Greece , and to the Egyptian city of Alexandria , where Euclid wrote his Elements . Did they see sharp visions of cause and effect because they lived in air of razor clarity ? Did it hint of a realm beyond the clutter of detail , accident , emotion ? In a pristine world it is easier to imagine a province of the eternal which obeyed finer , more lofty and graceful laws . <p> The fire impressed me with the sheer raw power of nature . It disoriented my thinking and made difficult a return to the calculations I was doing in turbulence theory . Some part of me could not settle down to the neat , clean equations , precise markings for exact quantities ; the world outside was too rife with emotion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to be threatening , not standing at an abstract distance . <p> If science was such an unlikely event , one time only , perhaps we should be more mindful that its habits of mind persist in our own time . We can not rely on clear air to insure our trust in abstract reasoning . <p> Further , think of the assumptions behind the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence . Will intelligent life develop deductive reasoning ? And then build radios ? If it was a singular event for us , how might the raw edge of alien environments blot out those analytical habits which have led us up from darkness ? Unsettling thoughts . <p> There is great relief in this aftermath , of course . Still , sometimes it felt as if the world would keep trying until it got us . I suppose in a way it will . <p> Comments and objections to this column are welcome . Please send them to Gregory Benford , Physics Department , Univ . Calif. , Irvine , CA 92717 .
