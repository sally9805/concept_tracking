In this column , which takes an intimate look at diverse cultures , a Native American scholar confronts the disturbing reality that American Indians are endangered and asserts the critical need to keep cultural records By Paula Gunn Allen // YESTERDAY A STUDENT SAID something that forced me to contemplate a world without Indians . He said that the elder people knew we were disappearing , and when something is ending , it gets smaller . He said it 's like a shutter on a camera-the opening grows smaller as it closes . That is why , he said , so many of us have begun to write . We write everything down so there will be a record . The student is the second chief of his tribe , the Narraganset ; he is at UCLA Berkeley pursuing Native American Studies and anthropology , readying himself to research and record everything he can about his tribe and others . The class let out after five o'clock . I left the campus and walked down Telegraph Avenue toward the parking lot . I saw people going past me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goods on display in the windows . I went by restaurants and coffeehouses . Nowhere did I see an Indian , an item produced by or even reminiscent of Indians , a food or beverage that was identified in my mind , or in the minds of those around me , as Indian . Coffee is Indian , but not really . Corn , turkey , tomatoes . Pumpkin , chili , tortillas . So many things . But we do n't think of them as Indian . And there was no Indian visible anywhere , not even me . Twenty-four hours later I still had n't begun to deal with my student 's remark . How do you touch extinction ? How do you comprehend that your entire world is about to vanish ? I believe Sitting Bull did that . He comprehended the totality of death . He went with Buffalo Bill 's Wild West Show , like the last exotic striped quagga would have gone with the zoo . He told the people to see to it that the children got educated in the White man 's schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could . They left the wondrous way of the Sioux , became ranchers and farmers , Christians and bureaucrats , soldiers in the conqueror 's armies , welfare recipients . By the 1960 's their life expectancy was as little as 44 years . It has barely increased . Walking along Telegraph , I remembered a time when I lived in an Indianless world . I was in Oregon in the sixties , attending the university in Eugene . For the first year or so I never saw or heard of an Indian . I was the only one I knew . In Oregon I saw a shrink . I did n't know the name of the disease I was suffering from , did n't know I was only grieving and lost . I thought I was mentally ill . I was involved back then-in the Civil Rights Movement , in the Peace Movement . I taught and spoke out and wrote . One night at the local campus bar I was in conversation with two radical Black men , a White man ( my husband ) and a couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One Black man said I could n't know how significant it was , that I had no reason to care . He said I was a groupie , a voyeur . The other one disagreed ; I at least had the same difficulties as Black people , he said . I faced the same oppression , repression , depression . " She 's a woman , " he said . " For her it 's even worse . " Nobody said , " She 's an Indian . " Not my husband . Not even me . By 1982 I had moved to California to teach Native American Studies at Berkeley . The only Indians I saw were in my classes ( two among 40 students ) or in the department 's offices . Today of some 21,000 undergraduate students enrolled at Cal , something like 260 are American Indian . Out of more than 270 million people in the United States , slightly more than 2 million are American Indian . When I think of the figures , I wonder how I could have lived so many years thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that on the eve of contact with Europeans , upward of 45 million Indians lived in what is now the United States . Health workers say that more than 25 percent of Indian women and 10 percent of Indian men here have , while undergoing medical treatment been sterilized without their knowledge or consent . Scratch several hundred thousand future Indians . Many " marry out . " Go to the cities and get lost . More than a quarter of all American Indians now live in cities . Maybe more . They walk down Telegraph or Central or Market or Fifth Avenue . They see themselves nowhere . Do you remember the child 's song " One Little , Two Little , Three Little Indians " ? The first part counts one , two , three , up to ten . The second part counts backward : ten , nine , eight little Indians , seven , six , five little Indians , four , three , two little Indians , one little Indian . Lens closing . So light does n't get through . " The only good Indian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . But I did n't understand until now that what Sitting Bull advocated was not wrung from him by defeat in a years-long war . It was a statement about who and what Indians are in America-more than forgotten , more than oppressed , more than terminated , relocated , removed . The word for it is extinguished . Too many of us dead . I can imagine a world without Indians . It is a world that has surrounded me most of my life ; I only just recognized it . So it 's critical that we begin to preserve not just our living culture but also our recordspictures , foods , artifacts , heritages of Indians . As my student understood , we must write down our stories , so they will not all be transformed into something unrecognizable to an Indian . Even as the lens closes , we must , like the camera , record an image for posterity . * Author Affiliation Paula Gunn Allen , author of Grandmothers of the Light ; is a professor of English and Native American Studies at UCLA This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boundary-Busting , Border-Crossing Loose Cannons by Paula Gunn Allen .
