<p> The magic of Doug Flutie , a miniature quarterback with a penchant for heroics , always will serve as inspiration . <p> The rise of Brigham Young University , once a program that could n't compete with the annual deer hunt , always will seem improbable . <p> And the heartwarming tale of Rudy Ruettiger , a Joliet native who walked on at Notre Dame , was good enough for Hollywood . <p> But the world of college football never has seen anything like the amazing transformation of a Big Ten doormat , the remarkable rise of the Northwestern Wildcats . <p> " It 's absolutely , undeniably unbelievable , " former Syracuse coach Dick McPherson said . " Hell , they 've even managed to wake up ( NU alumnus ) Charlton Heston . " <p> In one season , Northwestern has beaten Michigan and Notre Dame on the road and taken out Penn State at home . The Wildcats ( 8-1 ) , who went 3-7-1 in 1994 , are guaranteed their first bowl berth since 1949 , and if they close the season with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in NCAA history to produce a turnaround of seven or more games in one season . <p> Oh , and one more thing . <p> Barring a late-season collapse , Northwestern will go down as the best story in the history of college football . <p> " It 's the greatest thing that 's happened in the past 20 years , " ABC analyst Bob Griese said . " But the book is n't finished yet . We 're still writing chapters . If everything falls the way they might , and you can see the end of the road from here , they will be the greatest story in history . " <p> Only two teams can boast of eight-game improvements in one season . <p> After going 1-7-1 in 1939 , Stanford posted a perfect 10-0 record the following season to finish second in the nation . <p> Stanford 's turnaround , however , forever will be linked to a gimmick . Former University of Chicago coach Clark Shaughnessy took over the program in 1940 and installed the T-formation . The competition had no clue what hit it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1943 , finishing fourth in the nation . Again , it came with an asterisk . <p> " The war department created officer training schools for the navy and marine recruits , " said Pat Harmon , a college football historian . " One of them was Purdue , and they acquired some pretty good players from other schools . " <p> Like All-America guard Alex Agase , who came from Illinois . Agase would go on to coach Northwestern from 1964 to ' 72 . <p> " So do I know of a better story ? " Harmon said . " No , this is most unusual . I mean , they have n't won the Big Ten since 1936 . <p> " They only went to the Rose Bowl in 1948 ( the game was played Jan. 1 , 1949 ) because the Big Ten had a rule against the same team going in consecutive years . Michigan won it in 1947 and again in 1948 . But the league barred them from going . " <p> Kent Stephens , curator for the College Football Hall of Fame in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story for the ages . <p> " And you know what 's strange ? " he said . " We moved the Hall this year , and guess who was the first team to visit ? " <p> Northwestern ? <p> " Yep , they came in on a Friday , then went out and beat Notre Dame on Saturday , " Stephens said . <p> There are many comparable stories of teams that have unexpectedly risen to power . <p> Oregon emerged from the Pacific-10 Conference to win a berth in last year 's Rose Bowl . And Wisconsin 's sudden resurgence under Barry Alvarez led to a Rose Bowl victory in 1994 . <p> There are other examples strangely linked to Northwestern , such as Colorado 's ascent to the top of college football . Under Bill McCartney , the Buffaloes were 1-10 in 1984 . Six years later , they were national champions . NU coach Gary Barnett was an assistant coach on that team and took some pretty good notes . <p> In 1986 , Syracuse was 5-6 . The following season , the Orangemen went undefeated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McPherson . <p> " The No. 1 thing is you have to have a program and a support system in place , " McPherson said . " And there has to be a marriage between the coach and the athletic director . " <p> For McPherson , that was athletic director Jake Crouthamel , who once worked with NU athletic director Rick Taylor when the two were at Dartmouth . <p> " But we had a much bigger advantage than Gary ( Barnett ) , " McPherson said . " We had the Carrier Dome , something that shows commitment . Gary had 76 trombones , but it 's clear he 's the kind of guy who works at the job he has now , not one he 's going to have in the future . " <p> A similar scenario occurred at the University of Pittsburgh , which was 1-10 in 1972 . Johnny Majors took over the program in 1973 , and three years later , the Panthers were national champions . <p> Majors did it by selling a program that had done nothing to a running back named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NU with tailback Darnell Autry . <p> " People do n't know what it 's like to be on the other side of the fence , to be one of the have-nots in college football , " Majors said . " Everything in college football is built on tradition , and to break through that is awfully tough . <p> " It was easier for us because there was no limit on how many players we could recruit . What Northwestern has done is phenomenal . " <p> Majors ' first victory in the rebuilding process came against Northwestern , in the sleet and rain at Dyche Stadium . <p> " Dorsett ran 75 yards late in the fourth quarter , and we beat them 21-14 , " Majors said . " I watched their game against Penn State , and I saw the same qualities in that tailback ( Autry ) . " <p> Now Majors is a fan of Northwestern . But not like his grandson . <p> " He opened this catalog of merchandise  --  you know , the one that sells things like Emmitt Smith 's jersey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , ' Grandpa , can you believe it ? They do n't carry any Northwestern stuff . ' " <p> So what can compare to NU 's rise from the ashes ? Not Brigham Young 's , even though the Cougars could n't sell out a 15,000-seat stadium in the 1960s and never scheduled games during the annual deer hunt in Provo , Utah . <p> Under coach LaVell Edwards , they won a national championship in 1984 , sell out a 65,000-seat stadium every game and have become the pride of the Mormon church . <p> The 1982 Iowa Hawkeyes were groundbreakers , too . They had n't had a winning season in the previous 19 years , then exploded on the scene to finish 8-4 in Hayden Fry 's third year . The Hawkeyes won the Big Ten but lost 28-0 to Washington in the Rose Bowl . <p> Like Northwestern , Iowa beat some big names that year  --  Nebraska , UCLA and Michigan . And like Northwestern , they had a fluke loss  --  a 23-12 defeat to Iowa State . <p> But in terms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no comparison . <p> Not even Flutie can top the Cats , though his story of perseverance is amazing . He was on the verge of being switched to defensive back his freshman year , but Boston College 's No. 1 quarterback , John Loughery , tore a ligament in his throwing hand while doing calisthenics . <p> With the Eagles trailing 31-0 at Penn State , coach Jack Bicknell bypassed the Nos. 2 and 3 quarterbacks , ordering Flutie in off the bench . <p> " It was literally , ' Flutie , go see what you can do , ' " Bicknell said . <p> From there , Flutie led Boston College to three consecutive bowl games ( their first appearances in 40 years ) , beat Miami in the Orange Bowl on a famous Hail Mary pass , won the Heisman Trophy in 1984 and became the first college quarterback to throw for more than 10,000 yards . <p> " It was an amazing ride , " Bicknell said . " But we had to do some things unique to utilize a small quarterback . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and play you straight up , which means they 're no fluke . I 'm so happy for them . " <p> So is former NU coach Ara Parseghian , who was most impressed with the Cats ' comeback victory over Illinois . <p> " They 've always been beaten up on , and they 've always had a breaking point , " Parseghian said . " They got down to Illinois 14-0 , and last year , that might 've turned into a 45-0 game . <p> " Barnett has changed that completely , and that tells you a great deal about that football team . But I do n't want to jinx them . " <p> Indeed , Parseghian got off to many good starts with the Cats before his lack of depth caught up to him . In his last six years at NU , Parseghian was 32-22 , but only 4-14 over the seasons ' last three games . <p> If Northwestern can hang on , change the course of history , its legacy will be complete . <p> " You can put them on ABC , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only the people in Chicago know how incredible this turnaround is , " McPherson said . " Because you 're the ones who lived through it and suffered every year . And you 're the ones who heard every year that Northwestern should drop out of the Big Ten . <p> " So enjoy it , Chicago , because the nation will never forget this team . " @x It 's an appealing fantasy : Start a blog . Watch it take off . Then , quit the office life , sit at home , and live off the advertising revenue . But successful , moneymaking blogs elude most people who try to start them . The vast majority of blogs , written primarily for family and friends , attract fewer than 50 page views a day and earn pennies per month , if anything . According to a Problogger survey , most bloggers earn less than $100 per month , and 3 in 10 earn less than $10 per month . Only 16 percent of the 4,000 respondents say they make more than $2,500 a month . Gia Lipa , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started her personal finance blog , the Digerati Life , in 2006 to teach herself more about the Internet . She started networking with other personal finance blogs and soon had a growing number of online friends who linked to one another 's blogs . Within six months , her blog pulled in between 800 and 1,000 visitors a day , and the audience has since grown sevenfold . In early 2008 , Lipa left her full-time job as a technical engineer to put 50 hours a week into her blog . She now earns about $10,000 a month through ads , links , and guest blogging . " I 'm amazed how it turned out , " says Lipa . " I did n't know I could replace my engineer salary after a year . " Like Lipa , the most successful bloggers tend to pick a topic that they love but that also fills a niche in the blogosphere . And while building traffic is a prerequisite , learning how to monetize the content is just as essential to turning a hobby into a moneymaking operation . Paul McFedries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Website , says there are three basic ways to make money. : First , bloggers can run advertisements through a program like Google AdSense , which matches up ads with blog content and pays based on how often visitors see and click on the ads . A blog about dogs , for example , might feature ads for shelters and dog food . The second way is through affiliate programs such as Amazon.com , which shares book-sale profits with websites that refer customers . And third , bloggers can turn a profit by selling related products that they design , such as T-shirts or crafts . Lynnae McCoy , a 37-year-old mother of two and the creator of the Being Frugal blog , recommends placing ads on the site from the start so readers get used to the look and do n't complain when they 're added later . McCoy , who earns about $1,000 a month from her blog , says advertisers started contacting her as soon as her blog began to appear as one of the top links in popular Web searches , such as " being frugal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because you have to work hard to get your blog noticed , " says McCoy . When Jim Wang , 28 , the Columbia , Md. - based author of the Bargaineering blog , writes about saving money on vacation , he tries to mention the site Travelzoo , which pays him $2 for every person who signs up for its newsletter after clicking on Wang 's link . He did n't earn much money during the first two years of his blog. , But now it gets around 850,000 page views a month , and he turns those eyeballs into $10,000 a month . Supplemental income . Some bloggers also use their site as a way to advertise their skills and services for additional income . After Lipa took advantage of Google AdSsense and affiliate programs , which each make up about one third of her revenue , she offered her blogging services , including outreach work , to other sites and corporations . She now charges an hourly rate that makes up the rest of her revenue . " It takes years to get to the point where you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who did n't get more than 100 visitors a day for the first six months of his blog 's life . From a monetary perspective , he says , it would have made more sense to stick with his day job as a software developer . That 's why he warns anyone against pursuing a blog just for the moneymaking potential . " Your time is better invested elsewhere if you 're doing it for the money , but if you have a passion or some other motivation , do it , " says Wang . He follows his own advice : In addition to Bargaineering , Wang writes low-earning blogs on grilling and Scotch .
