NATION <P> While President Bill Clinton 's decision to withdraw law professor Lani Guinier 's nomination as Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights mollified moderates , it infuriated the professional civil rights establishment and made the President appear weak and incompetent . After a meeting with Guinier in the Oval Office , Clinton admitted , mortifyingly , " At the time of the nomination , I had not read her writings . In retrospect , I wish I had . " The President and First Lady have been friends of Guinier 's for 20 years . While claiming that he could not defend Guinier 's positions , Clinton also insisted that many of them were distorted in the press . " This has nothing to do with the political center , " the President said , when asked if dumping her was part of a general , recent move to the political right . " This has to do with my center . " At a dinner that evening , Clinton said of Guinier , " I love her . . . If she called me and told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my account and give it to her , no questions asked . " <P> Clinton had started the week uncertainly , braving shouts of " Draft dodger ! " and " Shut up , coward ! " at his ceremonial Memorial Day visit to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial . The President , who knelt to make a rubbing of the name of a boyhood friend , James Herbert Jeffries , also received some applause . <P> Clinton chose the conservative Democratic city of Milwaukee as the setting for his announcement that he was willing to cut both taxes and spending in his budget plan . He asked that education and job training be spared , but appeared ready to sacrifice part of his proposed energy tax . Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen later said it might be reduced by as much as a third . Clinton also delayed a push to increase the minimum wage . <P> Compounding Clinton 's troubles , Democrat Bob Krueger , the appointed occupant of Bentsen 's Senate seat , lost the Texas Senate race to Republican Kay Bailey Hutchison . The defeat reduced the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secretary of Defense Les Aspin warned that the academic quality of new recruits sank slightly in the first half of this year : only 94% had high school diplomas , vs. 97% in 1991 . Aspin said he would spend more money on recruiting . <P> Aspin caused the government to spend some money himself when he and a woman friend enjoyed four days in Venice at the Danieli , one of Europe 's most expensive hotels . Aspin and his companion paid for their accommodations , but those of Aspin 's 31-person retinue , some of whom also stayed at the Danieli , were picked up by taxpayers . <P> The Supreme Court ruled that a verdict must be voided if the judge fails to properly instruct the jury that it has to find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt . That was a relief to civil libertarians in light of the court 's previous rulings that other irregularities , such as coerced confessions , can be deemed " harmless errors , " which would not automatically taint a conviction . <P> A mysterious illness that took the lives of 11 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large Navajo reservation straddling the borders of three Western states , has confounded epidemiologists attempting to determine its cause . The disease starts with flulike symptoms and rapidly causes suffocation . " I went to get a haircut today , " said the editor of a local Navajo newspaper , " and somebody was saying maybe it 's the end of the world . "
