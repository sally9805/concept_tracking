" BETTER PRAY HARD you never have a daughter , " my father said to me that night in July , forgetting , I suppose , that I was his other daughter . Effy had sneaked out , and sometime after midnight he discovered  --  only a bearded God knows how  --  that she was gone . Effy had turned sixteen ; I was nearly eighteen and bound for a community college in the fall . I was unhappy with Father for not letting me attend a university away from home , and I was reading Sylvia Plath and trying to resist all the methods I had invented to torment him . <p> In a sense Effy was doing the job for me . But she wanted help. , and for most of that summer I was unwilling to give it . In some ways I was sentimental like my father . I held on longer than I should have : not just to my silver puzzle ring or the tiny ink-blue seashells he brought back to us from Crete , but also to memories . <p> Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constellations , not memories ; and he saw them everywhere , even when he turned away from the telescope . He would recall them years afterwards , as if presenting a family snapshot that had been developed and then framed nowhere else but in his mind . " Yes , " he would say , surprising us with details . " That was the last time . Your mother and I had just finished playing table tennis . Helen , " he 'd say to me , " you were standing by the bed with your thumb in your mouth and that yellow pull toy under your arm . Do you remember ? " And then he would say to Effy , " That was the last time we changed your diaper ; the very last . " <p> I was equally susceptible and spent too much time gazing after childhood constellations . It was hereditary , I suppose , and even now , when I see my own children 's toys scattered about the room  --  a pink rattle next to a water teething-bracelet with fish and turtles swimming inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glass door ; a Paddington bear , his brown safety-pinned hat knocked askew , waiting for Raggedy Ann to get off his foot  --  even now I 'm tempted to remember their arrangement . <p> See the little girls sitting on the shed door that has fallen into the grass and become a red and gray boat . They are floating somewhere on the warm , bleached wood . Sandwiches for the journey ahead wait beside them , inside neatly folded waxed paper . <p> If you stay away too long , I 'll cry , says Father . <p> My father 's curses woke me that night . He came out of Effy 's empty bedroom , dragging her blanket and sheets down the hallway past my opened door and into the living room . He threw everything , including the lace-edged pillows , at my mother 's feet . <p> " Maybe there 's some explanation , " she said . <p> " Explanation ? I 'm going to strangle her . " <p> We were in our summer pajamas , but my father wore jeans and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I knew he 'd been outside because there were red welts on his arms where mosquitoes had bitten him . As he walked back and forth , his shoes left blotches of mud on the sheets . <p> Later when he went to the screened porch to watch for Effy , Mother asked me to stay out there with him . <p> " No , " I said . <p> She said , " He 'll just get madder if I talk to him anymore tonight . " <p> " I do n't want to , " I said . " I do n't like to see him this way . " <p> " He 's really a sweet man . " <p> " Not anymore , " I said . " You 're talking about somebody else . " <p> Mother sighed . She knelt on the couch cushion and faced the window . Long , dark hair fanned across her thin shoulders . After a while she said , " Helen , he loves you kids . " <p> " Oh , really ? " ! said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> She was quiet for a long time . Then she said , " Maybe it does n't look like love , but it is . " <p> So I went out there on the porch in the middle of the night , and that 's when my father turned to me and said , " Better pray hard you never have a daughter . " <p> When we were younger Father could always get the Christmas tree lights to work . But we liked him best during Monopoly or Scrabble . Games made life easier , and before the trouble started we used to play three or four times a week . A thick blue dictionary remained close to the board , ready to settle disputes ; a rule book always lay in the opened game box , and we consulted it often . It was the same with cards . We all knew what to expect . When we played penny ante , Father would chew his mustache and count the glossy cards : " Well , so far , so good : four aces , four kings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , until he had finished with the new deck and assured us that , like magic , everything was as it should be . <p> He had an export business in upstate New York , close to the Canadian border , and he had a license to exchange money . He bought Canadian money from local business people , then would take it across the border to a bank . He was Greek ; my mother was French and English . Whenever he returned from Montreal , he would bring Effy and me baklava and charms for our bracelets . He 'd bring Mother perfume or silk blouses with vivid colors that reminded me of cherries and lemons . Pita bread filled our freezer , and it was difficult to close the oak cabinet under the sink because of the tin gallons of extra-virgin olive oil pressing against the doors . <p> As I stood on the porch with him , I thought of jokes I 'd heard about the possessiveness of Mediterranean men toward the women in their lives  --  even those men , like my father , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my father , it seemed to me , many of them had strong , handsome faces with mustaches and wonderfully smooth , dark skin . And  --  as Eft ) , pointed out  --  those tear-shaped , fig-merchant eyes that stared back at you as if from old Baghdad movies . But I had trouble putting my father , who seemed incapable of letting us become grown women , into any of the jokes . Even as a child I knew that he loved us with a sense of desperation and doom . He tried to believe we 'd always be young . But after we 'd grown up , Mother told us that he always heard the clock ticking above our heads , and that , she explained , was why we had so many charms on our bracelets and so much olive oil under our sink . <p> See the little girls floating on the shed door . Whenever Effy falls into the grass , Helen says , Shipwrecked , and helps her back in . <p> Where are you going ? Father says . <p> I asked if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chess . <p> " No , " he said . " Go to bed . " <p> " I ca n't , " I said . " I 'm worried about Effy . " <p> A warm wind fluttered the nylon screening around the porch . I looked up at the stars and tried to find a constellation , but all the pinpoints of light melted together and floated above the wind . Father had a telescope and knew the constellations by heart . When we were younger , he 'd take us by the arm , point into the night sky , and say : " There 's the Big Dipper . See that W-shaped constellation with the five stars ? That 's Cassiopeia 's Chair . " <p> Yes , we 'd say , even when we were n't sure of what we were seeing . <p> I asked how long he was going to stay up , and he said , " There 's no way I can sleep . I 'll wait as long as she 's out . " <p> I slumped in a wicker chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resembled tiny owls beat their papery wings against the screens . Sometimes Father would leave the porch and walk up the driveway to the road . I 'd lose sight of him as he stood by the mailbox . We lived in the country . Our nearest neighbor was a hundred yards down the road . Except for a dim streetlight it was dark out there , and quiet . But you could hear the stubborn , chalklike moths and the warm wind pushing through the pines and hemlocks . <p> I had no idea where Effy was . But I knew that she had been hanging around with some boys at summer school , and that my father suspected as much . Effy was intelligent , but she 'd spent the school year staring at boys and hanging out at the mall instead of studying . And so she 'd failed algebra . I tried to tell her what would happen , but at the same time I wished I 'd had some of her nerve . <p> For all I knew she could have been standing out there in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tug at his shoulders . <p> I fell in and out of sleep , and whenever I opened my eyes to remember where I was , the night spread out before me like a dream  --  with imagined wind and trees and an imaginary father chasing his daughter across the starry sky . Once I thought Mother came out and told me I should go to bed , but I was too tired to answer . <p> Then , near morning , I heard Father 's voice . The stars had disappeared and the sky had lightened , and I could see the skinny , fernlike locust trees that lined the driveway . He had stayed up all night to surprise Effy at the mailbox . The leather purse he 'd bought her in Florence was tucked under her arm . She carried her white sandals . <p> Before he hit her , she said , " No , Dad , I 'm sorry , " and then his hand caught the side of her head . She held the sandals in front of her face , but he hit her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sandals and started hitting her on the head with them . <p> " Dad ! " I yelled . Then I came off the porch and called up to my mother 's window . " Get out here , " I said . " He 's killing her . " <p> Effy tried to run back to the road , but he caught her arm and swung her around . Stones skidded under their feet as Father blocked the way back . <p> I thought , For God 's sake , Effy , show some emotion . Cry . Say you 're sorry again . Do n't make him any madder . <p> " Get out of my way , " she said . She glanced at me , then tried to push past him . But he grabbed her hair , and before I could tell what happened they were bent over the car hood . Effy was trying to kick him : her leg struck out and her white dress raised up like a moth 's wing . But he twisted her around by the hair and pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill you , " he said , " if that 's what it takes . " <p> " I 'm telling Mother , " I said . I could hear the tinny sound of Effy 's silver barrette strike the car metal . " The police are on the way . " <p> And then Mother came running in her pale-blue pajamas and bare feet . Effy broke free , her torn hemline looping out behind her , and ran into the house . Dampness had spread across the three Sirtaki dancers on Father 's shirt . His eyes were wild and moist . He looked at me and said , " She deserves it . She 's become a whore . Where my grandfather lived , " he said , " they would have killed her with stones . " <p> " This is America , " my mother said through clenched teeth . " This is n't any stupid town in Greece . " <p> He stared at the house . " America ! " he shouted . " Hollywood ! Twenty-four-hour television ! " He picked up Effy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then he turned it upside down and shook everything out . Gum , keys , comb , lipstick , change , wads of Kleenex : everything fell to the ground . He stood over the contents and pushed things around with his toe as if they might foretell the future . He coughed and rubbed his eyes . <p> Then he went into the house and asked Effy where she had been . " Why are you all dressed up ? " he said , taking the hem of her dress into his hand and making a fist . " What the hell 's going on ? You smell like a perfume factory . " <p> " I was downtown , " she said . <p> " Where ? " he asked . " With who ? " <p> " A girlfriend . " <p> Mother went to the kitchen and came back with two washcloths . She held one to Effy 's nose , while I dabbed the other against my sister 's matted hair . <p> " Why 'd you sneak out ? " he said . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even if we asked . " <p> " That 's right , " he said . " You 're not old enough . You are n't going anywhere until you 're old enough . If I have to lock you in your goddamn room until you turn eighteen , then I 'll lock you in your goddamn room . " <p> He had never sworn at us before , and he 'd never hit us . My sister and I watched each other , realizing , I think , that the summer was taking us. where we 'd never been before and that  --  no matter what happened-things would never be the same . <p> Father was tired , maybe on the verge of tears . " I suppose you were drinking , " he said . " Or worse . " He rubbed his hands over his face as if afraid to look up again and risk seeing us still there . <p> Earlier that spring Effy had been thrown off the track team , charged with drinking wine at school , and Father had wanted to know the truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his question sent her running past the glowing forsythia and down the road beyond our house ; he ran after her in his dark business suit , a blue-and-red striped tie flying over his shoulder . He was saying : " I do n't care how far you run , you 're not getting rid of me . Even if I have a heart attack , I 'm keeping up . I want the truth . " <p> A half-mile later she told him she had n't been drinking . <p> " In that case I 'll back you up , " he said , doubled over with his hands on his knees and talking into the pavement . <p> ( " What else could I do ? " Effy told me afterwards . " I could have run for hours . I did n't want him to die right there in the road . " ) <p> So he went to school and argued that the coach had been wrong . She had n't smelled wine on Effy 's breath , but some kind of candy or gum , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home and told us that the discipline committee had changed its mind . He 'd argued Effy 's case and won . We were all happy , and we were going out to celebrate . But then he told us that he 'd seen doubt lingering on the faces of two committee members . So right there , despite protests , he called his lawyer and arranged for Effy to take a lie detector test . <p> When she heard this Effy held her head so still that only her ponytail was trembling . She said she could n't take the test because she really had been drinking . At first Father did n't believe her . Then his mouth sagged , and he said to us , " I just wanted the truth . " <p> Now he was asking where she had been tonight , and I could almost hear his mind whirling through Aristotle and Plato and anyone else he 'd been reading , their voices saying to him , " What is truth ? " <p> Effy coughed and said , " Okay , I went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her hand had been stamped by someone checking ID 's . <p> " You 're not old enough , " he said . <p> A few minutes later he called the police . After he hung up , he told Effy to wipe the mascara off : they were leaving . <p> " Why ? " she said . " Where ? " <p> He said to my mother , " We 're going to sign a complaint . " <p> " Now ? " she asked . " It 's five o'clock in the morning . " <p> " This is America , " he said . " You said so yourself . This is where justice is dispensed twenty-four hours a day , right ? We have to do things by the book , right ? " Then he dragged Effy outside , and seconds later we could hear stones spinning up into the Oldsmobile 's black fenders as they drove away . <p> Later I asked Effy if she had really gone someplace , or just made the whole thing up . I said , " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you ? At least some of the time , right ? " <p> She screwed her face up and her brown eyes became smaller . " Like hell , " she said . " That 's your style . You 're the observer . I was out , running around . Do you think I 'd come back if I knew he was out there ready to kill me ? " <p> That week he kept a close watch . Rather than wait for the school bus , he picked her up at summer school , and , once home , she stayed there . For a while it worked . The house was quiet because no one spoke to anyone else . Father seemed almost happy . With a magic marker he crossed days off the French Impressionist calendar , and as August arrived he said the summer was slipping away . He talked about selling the export business ; he said he might buy a boat for all of us . <p> In the meantime I told Effy to go easy . I said , " Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like I plan these things , " she said . <p> " He might change , " I said . " We used to have fun . " <p> She rolled her eyes . She was wearing Mother 's watch , and the loosefitting scarab-beetle wristband made her arm look thin and breakable . " I think you 're the one making matters worse , " she said . " When are you going to stand up to him ? " <p> " What do you mean ? " <p> " When are you going to invite some of the guys you 've been seeing over to meet Father ? " <p> " Pretty soon , " I said , surprising myself , but at the same time another part of my mind was thinking , Do n't do it : let Father think we 're little just a while longer . <p> " Do you promise ? " she said . <p> " I promise . " <p> A few days later Effy was yelling at Mother from the bathroom , and Father told her to lower her voice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Are you some god who owns my life ? " <p> I heard a noise , then saw that he had kicked the door open . Splinters of wood stuck out near the door casing . Effy was hysterical . " Do n't touch me , " she screamed . <p> " Lower your voice and apologize to your mother , " he said . <p> " If you touch me , " she yelled , " I 'm calling Social Services . " <p> " Go ahead , " he told her . " I 'll make it easy . " <p> " Do n't , " she said . <p> I started for the bathroom , but he was already coming out with Effy kicking and screaming . Her cheeks were orange from makeup . He carried her , feet off the floor , to the wall telephone in the kitchen . Her head hit the Boston fern . Mother said , " Have you two gone crazy ? " <p> " Effy wants to call Social Services , " I said . <p> " Yes , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm helping her make the call . " <p> In mid-August , when the occasional boy finally started to visit , Father sat in the large living room with us . He would ask questions : " What does your father do ? Where do you live ? What are your grades like ? Do you want something to eat ? " and they would supply short answers , then fall into silence . <p> " Can they talk ? " he 'd ask me afterwards . <p> " They can talk , " I 'd say , " but they are n't used to it . " <p> He complained that he never got a good look at them . <p> " What do you mean ? " I said . " You see as much of them as I do . " <p> " They dress the same , " he said . " Their faces run together . " <p> " That 's because they stop by in the evening when it 's getting dark . Besides , " I added , " there 's only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> He argued with Mother . He poked under lampshades , changed from 75-watt bulbs to 100 watts . He rearranged furniture , dragged easy chairs away from dim corners and closer to the center of the room . But still he complained . He said the boys fidgeted too much and seldom looked him in the eyes . In late August when evenings became cooler and the boys wore hooded sweatshirts or jackets , he said , " Their collars are always up , which makes them seem like they have retracting heads . " <p> I knew what Effy was thinking . We had always expected magic from our father , but now he had none to give . One day she told me she 'd heard Father talking to Mother about moving the family to Crete . <p> " What did she say ! " I asked . <p> " She said she 'd divorce him . " <p> " Oh , great , " I said , hoping it would n't come true . But Mother was n't herself : she was quieter , almost subdued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That 's all we need , total disintegration . " <p> Just before Labor Day Father bought the boat , a three-year-old cabin cruiser . There was room , he said , for us to sleep in it . Mother told him that Effy and I would be in school pretty soon . " We 'll have some nice weekends , " he said . <p> Effy cried when she stood on the unsteady dock of the local marina and saw the white-and-blue cruiser bobbing in the whitecaps . " He 's not going to force me to stay on some stupid boat , " she said . <p> Father talked about week-long trips on Lake Champlain , as if boating were a form of salvation . We could find quiet little bays and learn how to catch bass and perch . He bought fishing magazines . He held pages up which showed green pike with vicious smiles jumping above water lilies . One day he came home with curled-up charts of the lake , a fish-finder , and four fishing rods and reels . <p> And so we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buoys  --  above the narrow reefs our father would find on the lake charts . They were mournful days without music because the boat radio did n't work and Father did n't like bringing a portable along . The sky was often colorless and the wind blew much of the time . The boat 's motor vibrated in our heads ; it coaxed our arms and legs to sleep . We memorized the worn-down peaks of the Adirondacks while the fumes of gasoline drifted in behind us . Sometimes we caught yellow-and-green striped perch with orange fins and listened to them flop inside the plastic cooler . There were moments when we actually enjoyed ourselves , Effy and I , but as the days grew shorter and duck blinds began to dot the lake , we knew that time was on our side . <p> We were becoming something else besides daughters . Father , the tired , old magician driving the boat , must have felt it , too . <p> One warm , windless night in mid-September we were late coming back to the dock . None of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had stopped fishing . We were anchored in a bay a few hundred yards from an island where Benedict Arnold had fought a naval battle . We sat shrouded in life preservers and watched the far-off , blinking lights on the Vermont shore . Then stars came out  --  so many that the sky seemed heavier , then closer , and after a while we could n't separate them from the shore lights . <p> We felt hypnotized , and none of us talked . I thought , This must be what the Arctic sky looks like . I remembered reading about the emperor penguins of Antarctica and how they sat on their eggs for weeks in the lonely sub-zero darkness , never knowing if they would hatch . I wondered what it must feel like . When Mother asked if we were hungry , her voice startled me . Seconds later she handed us sandwiches wrapped in waxed paper . They were cut diagonally , the way she and Father always sliced them . ! took a bite . Then ! asked Effy , who sat beside me , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high grass when we were children . It had been my earliest childhood memory . <p> " I think so , " she said . <p> " Sometimes we played shipwreck . When we fell off , we 'd help each other back on . " <p> " I think I remember , " Effy said in a sleepy voice . <p> After I finished the sandwich , I stood and adjusted a twisted strap on my life preserver . " Here goes , " I whispered . " Helen , wait , " she said . <p> But I was already flipping overboard , like a scuba diver . Mother made a small noise , then watched without saying anything . Effy yelled down at my bubbles . Then she jumped , too . The force of her weight spun me sideways as I bobbed to the surface . <p> We pushed away from the boat ; warm water rushed over our backs and shoulders . Effy , coughing and laughing , asked what I was doing . <p> " I do n't know , " I said . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep up with me . " Where are we going ? " she said . " I do n't know . " <p> In a few minutes I slowed down and just floated . I let my feet sink toward the bottom , hoping I would n't touch seaweed . The mainland was a mile or so away . The island , a dark mass of rock and cedar , was much closer . <p> Father had come out from the galley . I heard him say to Mother , " I 'll be damned . " He stood on the backseat trying to locate us . <p> " They 're okay , " she said . <p> " Okay ? It 's nighttime . They are n't dressed for swimming . " <p> " They have life jackets , " she said . " They 're just out there , close by . " <p> " I ca n't see them , " he said . <p> " We can see you , " I said . <p> The boat was outlined against the sky . Mother was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white shirt ; a gold chain glistened around his neck . From the way he stood , leaning in the wrong direction , I knew he had no idea of where we were . " Get back here , " he said . <p> " Do n't worry , " I said . <p> Where are you going ? Father asked . <p> " We 're hitchhiking to Florida , " Effy said . <p> I laughed and swallowed some water . " Maybe I 'll get pregnant . " <p> " We both will , " Effy said . <p> ( Pregnancy was still years ahead of us , but it had felt good to send the word skimming across the smooth , quiet lake . ) <p> " There 's carp out there , " Father said . <p> That was true . With our flashlights we had seen them on previous nights-the size of small children  --  their platelike , scaled bodies floating through tunnels of seaweed . <p> Effy tugged at my life jacket . " It 's those huge fish with the whiskers . They 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harmless , " I told her . " Worse things could happen . " <p> " Carp and crayfish , " Father said , as if he had the power to summon them . <p> We were getting closer to the island . We could smell cedar . After a while seaweed touched our ankles , and I told Effy to float on her back , as I was doing . " Hold your legs out high in the water . " <p> " Is he coming after us ? " she said . <p> He had n't started the motor . " I do n't think so , " I said . The boat , now a dark toy , seemed too small to hold real people . <p> I can still hear you , Father said . " Hi , " Effy said . <p> " We 're still here , " I said quietly , surprised at how the words carried . <p> But we were also somewhere else , and we would remain there forever . Looking up at the fallen sky and its burden of stars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universe so huge that Father , even with his telescope and his charts , could never find us again unless we wanted him to . It would be easy ; just stretch our arms and legs , give a few kicks , and keep floating across the sky . And so we did . We took our sneakers off and fastened them to our jackets by the laces . We lost track of minutes and floated high above the carp and the crayfish . Sometimes I imagined I was back in the boat with Father and Mother , watching us move across the watery sky and feeling what they must have felt . <p> " They 'll miss us , " I said . <p> Effy 's face glistened . Her hand came out of the water like a fish , and she smoothed the wet hair back from my forehead . Reaching down , we traced the wrinkles in our feet ; we touched our shriveled hands together and Effy said , " We 're a million years old . " <p> When Father 's desolate voice reached us one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were startled and relieved . I 'm sorry , he said . I hope you 're coming back . <p> We answered , yes , even as we realized how impossible that would be . <p> <p> By PETER CORODIMAS <p>
