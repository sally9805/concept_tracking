THE BIG THREE QUATTRO PRO 5.0 FOR WINDOWS , STANDARD EDITION <p> Borland invented many of the best-loved and most-imitated features of Windows spreadsheets in its groundbreaking first release of Quattro Pro for Windows , including tabbed notebook pages , rightbutton mouse clicks for shortcut menus , and many graphing features . Although imitated , Quattro Pro retains its lead with its masterfully mature implementation of these features . Notebook tabs , for instance , are more useful in Quattro Pro : You can drag and drop them to change the order of pages , include them in selectable named groups , and even use them in formulas , <p> Similarly , Quattro Pro 's graphing module is superior , with more graph types , intelligent graphing that determines graph type by analyzing the number and nature of data sets , a light table for sorting slides , and slide shows with dazzling transition effects . <p> Quattro Pro reflects Borland 's practice of price cutting ( and with a vengeance ) : The standard version ( reviewed here ) is priced at $99.95 ( after a several-month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ players are priced at $495 . Is the competition five times better ? No way . Many would argue that the competition is not better at all . There is absolutely no question that Quattro Pro is an outstanding value . ( There is a $495 version : Quattro Pro 5.0 for Windows , Workgroup Edition . ) <p> Quattro Pro 's features prove its value . You can get help for every object on the screen , including the dozens of cryptic icons , by clicking an them with the right mouse button . A brief explanation window appears with a button to call up the full help screen . Help-the right help , not just the contents screen-is never more than two clicks away . Brief explanations for most on-screen objects also appear on the status line as the cursor passes over the objects . <p> Because of a court decision , Borland had to remove its direct support for the old Lotus 1-2-3 slash-key menu . Macros from 1-23 files now require substantial editing to work in Quattro Pro . <p> Quattro Pro 's tutorials are fully , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although the program supplies samples if you want ) while the tutorial program instructs you and makes sure you do the right things , It 's excellent as far as it goes , but it covers only elementary matters . <p> Five interactive Experts ( similar to Excel 's Wizards ) hold your hand through the processes of creating graphs , scenarios , and consolidations as well as determining if compiling your formulas would help ( the Performance Expert ) . The Analysis Expert offers instruction on 19 advanced functions , including miniapplications that create a mortgage amortization table and evaluate possible mortgage refinancing . The noninteractive Parse Expert evaluates and converts imported text strings to spreadsheet data , Quattro Pro 's Experts are the most powerful and easy to understand of the help features found in this group of spreadsheets . <p> There 's help with @ functions on the status line , showing the syntax of the function as you enter it . While you 're creating formulas in the control panel 's input area ( Quattro Pro does n't yet let you work on the face of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by color-coding them in pairs , Quattro Pro , with 373 @ functions , has more than any other program . <p> All this dragging and dropping of cells that spreadsheet users love can be dangerous , especially to someone with a less-than-sure hand on the mouse . It 's easy in 1-2-3 , for instance , to accidentally overwrite the contents of a cell by releasing the mouse button in the wrong place . Quattro Pro prevents this by prompting you for permission before it overwrites cell contents . <p> The Scenario Manager is not as far-reaching as 1-2-3 's , but it 's considerably easier to use and more flexible , The Data Modeling Desktop is a separate , linked application that provides multidimensional modeling . It 's not as powerful as Improv nor as easy to use as the Wizard-assisted pivot table in Excel , but it works well . The Data Desktop is a similar application that provides access to outside database files . You need Quattro Pro 's Workgroup Edition to reach beyond your own hard disk into networked files . <p> Quattro Pro is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the style of most Windows applications , for instance . The installation routine warns you to be sure nothing else is running , even asking you to boot with stripped-down configuration files . It also wants Share installed with certain specific parameters . On my system , the change in Share subtly fouled up other Windows applications until I undid the parameter changes . Professional software should not be that persnickety . <p> But blemishes and all , Quattro Pro is a powerhouse of a spreadsheet that will meet almost anyone 's needs for years to come-at one-fifth the price of the competition . It 's a best buy . <p> PHOTOS : Quattro Pro 5.0 for Windows , Standard Edition , Suggested retail price : $99.95 ; Minimum requirements : 386SX PC or higher with 4MB RAM , Windows 3.1 , 10MB hard drive space ; BORLAND INTERNATIONAL 100 Borland Way Scotts Valley , CA 95066 ( 800 ) 331-0877 ( 408 ) 431-1000 <p> By Richard O.
