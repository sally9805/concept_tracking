Washington warmly welcomed new Israeli Prime Minister YITZHAK RABIN 's decision last week to call a temporary halt to new settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip . But a major sticking point in U.S.-Israeli relations remains . The White House wants to sell 72 F-15 Eagle bombers to Saudi Arabia . Israel strongly opposes the sale , but McDonnell Douglas and its suppliers have been pressing Bush to let the sale go through . Last week the powerful 800,000- member International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers added to the election-year pressure on Bush , insisting that if the $5 billion sale is killed , nearly 40,000 aerospace jobs will be lost . Already facing major losses as defense spending is reduced , the aerospace workers are pressing Bush to save them " from the human scrap heap . "
