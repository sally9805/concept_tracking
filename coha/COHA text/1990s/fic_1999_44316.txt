The Battle of Fort McHenry <p> ABOUT THIS PLAY The War of 1812 has been called " America 's Second War of Independence . " It was the second time in just 29 years that the U.S. had gone to war against Britain . The reason : Britain was at war with France . Both nations had used naval blockades to stop U.S. goods from reaching each other 's ports . But Britain especially angered Americans by impressing ( forcing ) captured U.S. sailors to work on its ships . On June 18 , 1812 , the U.S. Congress agreed to President James Madison 's request for a declaration of war against Britain . For two years , the results of the war seesawed . But the U.S. could not keep Britain from blockading and raiding towns along its Atlantic coast . On August 24 , 1814 , the British even invaded Washington , D.C. , burning the White House , the Capitol , and other public buildings . Baltimore , Maryland , was Britain 's next target .
