IT WAS A SCENE RIGHT OUT OF THE BIRDS . OUTSIDE the New Hampshire home of former state senator Barbara Pressly on a freezing winter afternoon , a lone cameraman appeared ; then a second camera ; then four boom mikes . Twenty minutes later , when the press was invited inside , 50 men and women with full field packs stampeded toward the front door . Finding myself by happenstance between them and their goal , I had a fleeting sensation of what General Custer might have seen in his last moment on this earth . <P> I was lucky . At a Lamar Alexander rally in Des Moines , Iowa , on All Caucuses ' Eve , a cameraman for a local TV station , while trying to make his way through the forest of cameras and lights , knocked over a tripod , which slammed into the head of a young woman , knocking her into semiconsciousness . <P> These are two of the more dangerous manifestations of what has become patently obvious : there are simply too many of us out there . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Real voters ! Real people ! , " dozens of journalists instantly surrounded him as he reached for the hand of a single terrified citizen . Viewed from across the street , it looked as if Buchanan had suddenly gone berserk , seized a hostage and was being followed by a SWAT team . <P> When the press shows up en masse to cover " face-to-face " campaigning , only the pretense remains . Senator Bob Dole talks to a barnful of TV cameras and a few " lucky " residents of Indianola so the folks watching the news can see him talking to Iowa farmers ( two-thirds of whom were college students bused in from Ohio to give the event a shot of adrenaline ) . It has all the authenticity of an infomercial audience whooping it up for the Veg-O-Matic at two o'clock in the morning . <P> Now here 's what we can do about it : nothing . <P> You can " pool " an event with one camera inside a hall , but what do you tell the local TV stations that now journey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can beam back home on the cheap , thanks to satellite technology ? What do you tell independent stations , foreign journalists ? And besides , would it really be a good idea to reduce every campaign event to one single image , provided by one single view ? <P> Nor would the campaigns be especially thrilled by a shrunken press presence . " I know these lights and cameras are a little distracting , " Alexander said in a small church basement in Londonderry , New Hampshire , " but I 'm really glad to see them . " <P> If there is one dim ray of hope this year , it came from the campaign of Pat Buchanan . The New Hampshire victor did very little face-to-face glad-handing . He was , however , more than happy to invite the press in to watch him reach voters the new-fashioned way : recording commercials , videotaping commercials , even writing commercials . His other prime method of communication was decidedly old-fashioned : the speech at the rostrum , where audiences came not to shake his hand but to listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's an inventive way to cover a presidential candidate . And it cuts way down on the odds of bloodshed .
