How does a tropical beauty induce a diminutive beast to airlift sacs of pollen ? Writer ERIC HANSEN takes us on a behind-the-scenes tour of a bucket orchid . // Many orchids have evolved elaborate traps and obstacle courses to attract and capture their insect pollinators . The mechanisms within these flowers are often so daunting that , upon first glance , it is difficult to imagine why insects would visit the flowers once , let alone twice , to complete the process of pollination . For many biologists , from Charles Darwin onward , the insect/flower relationships within the family Orchidaceae have been prime examples of coevolution . They also can be seen to exemplify the lighter side of evolutionary fine-tuning , especially as it pertains to the rocky road of insect romance . In the case of Coryanthes speciosa , one of the species known as bucket orchids , and its insect pollinator , the male euglossine bee , there is an ardent suitor , tantalizing promises , a noble quest , intoxicating perfumes , deception , dancing , and adventure . This entire scenario is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an insect into completing the pollination process by transporting pollen from one blossom to another . Bucket orchids are epiphytes ( also known as air plants ) that sprout on trees in the wet tropical forests of Mexico , Central America , and South America . The flowers grow in clusters , and on the front of each flower are two winglike sepals . Just behind the sepals is a small floral " bucket , " which gives the plant its popular name . By the time the flower opens ( often with an audible popping sound ) , two special glands have already started to secrete a liquid that drips into the bottom of the bucket . The flowers now begin to produce a fragrance that proves irresistible to the metallic green male euglossine bee . The fluid dripping into the bucket is not a nectar , nor is it the source of the scent . The droplets serve a different purpose entirely . Soon after the orchid blooms , male bees , responding to the scent , start to swarm around the flower in a state of great agitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foothold on the mesochile , a tubular section that connects the bucket to the stem and front of the flower . From the slippery surface of this erect and slightly curving vertical shaft , the excited bees use their front legs to collect a scented wax from just below a bonnet-shaped structure called the hypochile . The bee uses the hairs on his legs to transfer the aromatic substance to special pockets on his hind legs . He will later use this potion to help him attract females during his courtship dance . Different species of Coryanthes attract different species of bees , because each male bee needs to have a very specific sort of scent . Only after the male bee has collected enough perfume is he ready to fly off in search of a mate . In a mad rush to get at the limited amount of perfume , many male bees can be attracted to the same flower . The flowers stay in bloom for only a few days , and the eager insects engage in a considerable amount of head butting , shoving with their midlegs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bees either loses his footing on the slick surface of the shaft and falls into the bucket , or gets knocked in when his wings collide with a droplet coming from one of the flower 's faucetlike glands . Once within the fluid of the bucket , the bee has only one means of escape : a narrow tunnel that leads through the front wall of the flower to daylight and freedom . Just at the entrance to this tunnel , on the inside wall of the bucket , is a step that the sodden male uses to climb out of the fluid and into the passageway . He then slowly squeezes and wiggles his way forward . But before he reaches open air , the bee must pass beneath a " twin pack " of pollinia-acs containing thousands of pollen grains-situated at the roof of the tunnel , on the anther , the male part of the flower . At a precise moment , the pollen disengages and becomes lodged on the bee 's back at the spot where the thorax and abdomen are hinged . By the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pollen is attached between his wings like a small backpack . Once out , the bee-wet and disoriented-pauses to dry himself on the flower 's lateral sepals . His ordeal may have taken as long as forty-five minutes . Photograph Opposite : A Coryanthes speciosa orchid exudes a droplet from a faucet gland .

" // In order for Coryanthes speciosa to be pollinated , a bee carrying pollinia must then be lured to another blooming orchid of the same species , fall into the bucket , and negotiate the floral obstacle course a second time ( the chances of this happening are remote , and consequently pollination occurs infrequently ) . On the bee 's visit through the second bucket orchid , a catch mechanism on the roof of the escape tunnel grabs the pollen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and diminished in size , so that it fits nicely onto the pistil , the flower 's female component . In this way the bucket orchid is pollinated , and with luck a seed pod will eventually form . The male bee may have been duped by the flower , but he has also collected what he needs-the waxy perfume . Freed of his backpack and remembering his own procreative duties , he flies off to a display site , where he dances and launches into an intricate flight and buzz pattern . A heady scent wafts from his hind legs as he performs the fancy footwork . With this kind of action going on , what female bee can possibly resist the temptation to land and get better acquainted ?
